virtue of their position in my own hierarchical scheme of movie values made little impression upon me  --  what , after all , is an assistant producer , a unit manager , a publicity man ? Of the rest , aside from the stars , three stood out in my mind , and it was these three , cramped side by side on a small gilt settee , who caught my attention as my spirit wandered restlessly away from Billy Raymond . The first was a young woman named Dawn O'Donnell , a slim carrot-haired girl who sat sipping a creme de menthe , and whose complexion for a moment I hardly believed , so chalky white it was , until 1 realized that it had been painted on  --  out of some obscure need to shock her beholders  --  with artful care . She was not pretty ; neither was she badly made ; she could have been quite attractive , actually , but with her orange hair contrastingso starkly with her ghostly white skin she had succeeded in her desire  --  and desire it must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the make-up  --  to look exactly like a clown . I remembered having heard about her and had seen her from a distance in Rome . Dawn O'Donnell was not her real name  --  so I had read somewhere  --  but then little about her at all was real . There had been a period when she had been a minor actress , she had had a one-man show of paintings , had published a small volume of verse . In none of her endeavors , including several marriages , had she shown a molecule of talent , but being the heiress to a vast American mercantile fortune had allowed her to persist in her trifling labors , all the while presuming , I suppose , as Thomas Mann once put it , that one may pluck a single leaf from the laurel tree of art without paying for it with his life . At the moment I gathered she was interested in the art of the film and tagged along all over Europe after the movie-makers , who because of her enormous wealth on the one hand , and her eccentric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange combination of deference and indulgence , and called her " Little Carrot-Top " and replied in passionate affirmatives to her never-ending " Do you think I 'm beautiful ? " I heard all this that night . Rosemarie told me she was sleeping off and on with Carleton Burns . Now sitting next to Dawn O'Donnell on the settee was a sleepy-eyed , smiling man named Morton Baer , a well-known recorderof gossip for the newspapers whose every word , syndicatedin the American-language paper in Rome , I had read with the same intense interest and delight I had once reserved for Keats . I knew him from his photographs . Baer was the only person present outside myself not dressed as if for an outing to the shore ;  |p101he  wore a fine flannel suit over his small , truncated , slightly hunched form , and a checkered yellow waistcoat , too , and he looked gentle and sheepish , sad even , as he tried dutifully to smile at Billy Raymond 's song , which he must have heard a dozen times before , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above the sneaking and mortifying admiration I had for the man  --  a celebrity in his own right  --  who hobnobbed almost on terms of blood kinship with movie stars on five continents , and knew J. Edgar Hoover and Herbert Bayard Swope , and had even dined several times at the White House . The third member of the trio , finally , was a face so familiar from his photographs that I had the impulse to go up and slap him on the back as I would a long-lost friend . But when at last it registered upon me who he was , flabbergasted , unable to tell whether I was struck more by the incongruity of his being a part of this worldly throng , or by a subtly unpleasant reasonableness , I could only gaze and gaze at him as if he were something at a zoo . For this was the Reverend Dr. Irvin Franklin Bell , the exemplary , prolific , and optimistic Protestant clergyman known and loved doubtless by more Americans than any man of the cloth since Henry Ward Beecher . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night but not for this ecclesiastical glamour , so offbeat , so rare , and I pieced together from Rosemarie later how it must have come about : Bell , confidant of potentates in industry and business , while on a vacationing , non-evangelical tour of Europe had encountered at the Hotel Hassler in Rome his old friend Sol Kirschorn , the producer . Kirschorn was an admirer of Bell , as were many highly placed American men of substance who found the doctor 's simple moral equation of wealth and virtue , virtue and wealth , as easy to abide by as to understand . Learning , then , that Sambuco was on Bell 's itinerary , Kirschorn accommodatingly got in touch with his wife , Alice Adair , and told her on behalf of the unit of which he was the producer and she the star , to offer the famous preacher ( he was staying at the Bella Vista , too ) every hospitality . What I saw at this moment was the result : portly , amiable , mightily sweating , his eyelids visibly wincing behind his bifocals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried nonetheless to hold on to his renowned sleek and jovial composure and , like a banker caught with his hand in the till , kept his cheeks plumped up in a sickly , illicit smile . I felt sorry for him in a way . Looking , in his floppy matching slacks and shirt of jade-green silk , like a print I had once seen of the dowager em/press of China , his wet under-lip poised as if to receive a gumdrop , or to emit yet another platitude , he was in an ecstasy of discomfort , and I felt that it was unfortunate that a solitary dirty song should intrude so upon his enjoyment of this sumptuous rich world , by which he yearned to be ravished . Billy Raymond came to the end of his song . I looked around for Mason but he was nowhere to be seen . As one last rippling chord brought the song to its conclusion , the trio on the couch made , each one , a fugitive gesture with his hands  --  Baer to stifle a yawn , Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uplifted to adjust her dangling earrings  --  so that for the most fleeting fraction of an instant they looked like those three little Oriental apes , mute , deaf , and blind to all evil ; turning , I thought I saw Mason mopping his face , passing through the distant doorway to another room , and I raised my hand to beckon to him but he was gone . A roar of applause and hand-clapping went up from the gathering . As I wheeled about to face the piano again , Rosemarie handed me a bowlful of peanuts . " I 've asked Giorgio to bring you something more substantial , " she whispered . " He should be along in a minute , " she added . " Is n't Billy fabulous ? I 'll swear he 's better than Noel Coward . He 's  --  But shh-h . . . " Silence fell over the house as Billy Raymondcommenced singing again , this time the sad limpid words of " As Time Goes By . " I 'm a fairly good judge in such matters , and it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior to many I had heard , including those of some amateurs . Nonetheless , the people went into some sort of a modified trance as they stood there listening  --  some propped chin in hands , their elbows resting on the piano ; the bare-necked and pretty girls with their eyes closed , arms crossed , caressing their own shoulders  --  and graduallyonly myself alert and so famished now I could hardly bear it , I picked out those among the group whom , after all , I had come here to see : the bewitching Alice Adair , slender and blond and with such an opalescent transparency of skin that around her gently dimpled temple , as in that frog 's tongue which as a boy I had peered at through a microscope , every capillary and vein was presented to the eye live and mortal and throbbing ; Carleton Burns again of the sex-glutted and ugly and dissipated face , the mean demonic dream-incubus of how many millions of women even his employers had no way of reckoning ; and finally Gloria Mangiamele , black-eyed and tranquil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had provided only the merest suggestion , whose marvelous breasts seemed to call out for seizing and fondling , but who , as she moved back now swaying slightly to the music , revealed a figure somewhat short-waisted and shortlegged , like many Italian girls , and an important feature which , from the point of view of my own taste , at least , I can only describe as duck-butted . But I was very hungry . I looked around once more for Rosemarie and just then  --  perhaps because , worn-out as I was , I was the natural prey of a cold  --  I sneezed . I sneezed again and again , a wet and exhausting barrage over which I had no control . " Can that , will you , for Christ sake ? " I heard a man 's voice say as the music limped and rattled to a stop . Billy Raymond 's lips hung open pink and tuneless , his tongue dancing in his mouth like the clapper of a bell . I heard the same anonymous voice again ; it seemed addressed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fools , of which I was the major example . " For Christ sake ! " " I 'm sorry , " I murmured . " For Christ 's own sweet sake ! " Someone tittered in the room , someone coughed ; a tinkling chord of the piano broke the silence and the husky plaintive song once more filled the room . And I , rebuffed , sidled gradually away from the group to a cool shadowy place near one of the windows ; here I sat with a cigarette between my twitching fingers , sulky , resentful , dreaming of steak . Yet now as I try to recall the events of that evening in their proper order , it occurs to me that it was along about here that something happened which was the first of a series of mysterious goings-on that got more and more baffling , more and more embarrassingand ugly , as evening wore into night , and night into morning . It did seem odd at the time , but not especially important , and so I have had trouble recalling all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as I can remember it . As I sat there I saw the dignified old butler  --  Rosemarie had called him Giorgio  --  tiptoeing with a tray in his hands through the songenthralledgathering and up to Rosemarie , who inclined her ear far down to hear what he whispered into it . A worried frown appeared on her face ; she peered indecisively about the room until , catching sight of me , she walked over to the place where I was sit-P104ting . Giorgio trailed in her wake . Behind her the piano music died in a sort of wan , resigned flutter ; the guests , unloosed from their cataleptic dream , broke into wild applause and shouts , apparentlyin vain , of " More , Billy , more ! "  --  and then slowly dispersed themselves , buzzing , around the enormous room . " Here , Peter , " said Rosemarie , " I hope this will do . It 's just what all of us had for dinner , and  --  " She made a vague motion with her hand at Giorgio , who set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's real American food and  --  I mean , it 's real . " Her voice sounded troubled and upset . " Peter , I ca n't understand what else Giorgio was trying to tell me . I think  --  " she said hesitantly , " I think he 's trying to tell me that Mason was  --  cut , or some-thing . " For a second her words did n't sink in . Giorgio had presented his tray . In the center of it was the steak Rosemarie had promised  --  a thick rare cut of sirloin . Off to the side was a pitcher , white and foaming , of the first real milk I had seen in years . Like someonehalf-crazed I made a lunge for fork and napkin , only to be brought up short by the urgent plea in Rosemarie 's voice . " Peter , please try to figure out what he 's saying . " " Che e successo ? " I asked the butler . He was a stooped and aristocratic-looking old man with white hair and a look of bleak concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was obviously not a native of the coast . " What 's happened to Signor Flagg ? " " He is all scratched around the face , signore . It is nothing serious , but he sent me to ask the signora where is what you call the mercurochromo and the Bond-Aids . It is nothing serious , but  --  " " But what happened to him ? " I said between bites . " I do not exactly know , signore , " he said gravely and apologetically . " There is a certain difficulty of  --  of communication betweenmyself and Signor Flagg . But I understood Signor Flagg , as well as I was able , to say that he fell into a rosebush . " " A rosebush ? " " Si , signore . " I translated all of this for Rosemarie , telling her about the rosebushand about Mason 's need for medication ; but just as I did  --  just as with round alarmed eyes and a startled " Oh ! " Rosemarie began to hurry off  --  I was forced by Giorgio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signor Flagg , according to Giorgio , had told him ( and of this he was sure ) that under no circumstances was the signora to come personally to his aid . It was nothingp105serious ( and here he turned his sad eyes on Rosemarie , saying with a gentle smile , " Non e grave , signora . " ) , nothing serious at all . The expression on his long bony face was now a single ache of embarrassment and apology , and his smile was one of such despairing insincerity that I could not help but feel that he was concealing something . " He says it 's nothing at all bad , " I told Rosemarie . " I just think maybe Mason does n't want to cause any furor , you know . Where are the Band-Aids ? " " In the cabinet , " she said in a blank voice . " In the cabinet in the bathroom in the upstairs wing . Tell him that . " " Where did you find this Giorgio ? " I asked , after the old man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak . " How do you and Mason communicate with the old fellow ? " For a long space there was no answer . I looked up at her . Distracted , with a deep despondent look in her eyes , she was gazing vacantly at the walls ; at some time since we had entered the palace she had managed to cover her shiner with a flesh-hued cosmetic , but the bruise must have still hurt her because she was absently stroking it with her hand . " What ? " she said finally . " Oh , Giorgio ? Fausto got him for us in Naples . He used to work for the mayor or something . We have a maid who speaks English and she sort of acts as a go-between . " She paused , then added mournfully : " I do hope Muffin 's O.K. Oh , I do hope he 's O.K. How could he fall into a rosebush , Peter ? " " Maybe he had one too many , " I said , trying to cheer her up . " Why the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if she had n't heard me ; without a word , the same blank look staring out from her troubled face , she moved away from me with slow shuffling reluctance toward the other guests . I was wondrously revived by the food ; with the red meat and the American-style milk inside me I felt a peace of mind  --  the first of the entire day  --  so calm and relaxed that it was like a state of beatitude . Giorgio , returning from his mission with the Band-Aids , ever attentive , poured me a snifter full of syrup-smooth cognac . Encouraged by the cognac , not quite so overawed now by the movie stars ( indeed , I had begun to feel a kind of brazen and totally unwarranted palship with them ) , I rose from my chair and with a shifty motion edged over toward one of the windows where Rosemarie , looming over all , was talking to Alice Adair . Next to them stood a stocky , red-faced , crew-cut young man with very good-looking features , and the calcimined Dawn O'Donnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Rosemarie said . Her spirits seemed to have been somewhat restored . She introduced me to Alice Adair , whose fingers I took between my own , holding my breath , and to Dawn , and to the crew-cut young mesomorph , whose name I did n't catch , whose function was a mystery to me , and who , extending for some reason his left hand instead of right , like a Hungarian , gave my palm a squeeze and without looking at me said : " Hiya . " His was the voice , I could suddenly tell , which had told me to shut up . " But darling , " Rosemarie was saying to Alice Adair , " I do n't care what Jacques said . I think the lavender thing is adorable . " " Sol does , too , " said Alice Adair . Her voice was incredibly sweet , beautifully modulated , and mellow , too , like a note in the middle register on a cello , and for an instant I could almost understand why people might stand in line for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I called Sol tonight , and he thinks the lavender thing is great , too . What Jacques is afraid of is that it will look fuzzy in Cinemascope . Or bleed , or something . " " It looks adorable on you though , " said Rosemarie . " It looks terrific on you , Alice , " said the young man . " Terrific . " " I think it does , too , " she replied , " but Sol said to stick by Jacques ' decision . Sol said he really knows color backwards and forwards . " " Too bad , " the young man said , " it 's a great gown , Alice . A great little gown . " " Sol has wonderful confidence in Jacques , " Alice Adair said . " Are you a Boston Leverett ? " Dawn O'Donnell said , startling me . " Well no , " I said , " actually I was born in Port Warwick , Vir  --  " " My family was from Boston , and I went to school there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? We lived on Chestnut Street , in a house with violet windows . My family was very rich . Do you like cats ? " " Well , yes and no , " I began to improvise . " It depends  --  " " I love cats . I have a Persian cat in Rome with hair the color of my eyes . Blue-gray like the sea . Do you think I 'm beautiful ? " " Can that , will you , baby , for God sake ? " The young man broke in , playfully grabbing her arm . " Of course you 're beautiful . " He turned back to Alice Adair , saying : " The pink thing looks terrificon you , too , Alice . Absolutely great . " " Sol thinks so , too , " said Alice Adair . " I guess I 'll have to wear it after all . "  | " I 'm going to cry , " Dawn O'Donnell said . " I 'm going to cry any minute now . Where 's Burnsey ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steady , " Alice Adair said . " Sol thought it was beautiful . " " It was terrific , " the young man said . " Really terrific , Alice . " " I thought you looked adorable in that , " Rosemarie murmured . " Do you mind if I cry ? " said Dawn O'Donnell , to no one inparticular . Like a swimmer treading water , I strove to keep my nose above the surface , but soon succumbed to the depths of a dreamy , brandy-hazed wool-gathering . Then in a moment Alice Adair wandered off , wrapped in a kind of golden nimbus of loveliness , and Rosemarie  --  as if she sensed my sudden distress at beingtrapped alone with the crew-cut young man and Dawn O'Donnell  --  ledme away and across the room . " I 'm so glad you feel better , " she said . " You really looked quite ashen this afternoon . " " Where on earth is Mason ? " I asked . But before she could reply we blundered into Dr. Bell , who had adjusted a wicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ear as if to invisibleparishioners , was making his exit with an air of rakish sanctity . " Oh , Dr. Bell , are you going so soon ? " Rosemarie exclaimed . " I told you to call me Irvin , my dear , " he said with a smile , seizing her hand and patting it . " Yes , I 've got to be up and away to Paestum early in the morning . Please tell young Mason how much I enjoyed his hospitality . I 've got Sol Kirschorn to thank for many things but nothing , pleasure-wise , so much as beingput in touch with "  --  and here I thought I saw him wink up at her through his bifocals  --  " with such beauty . Good-by , my dear , and I hope the good Lord allows our paths to cross again . " " ' By , " said Rosemarie . " Good night all , and God love you . " And then he was gone , trailing behind him an odor of bay rum and sweat . " He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He writes such  --  such drivel . But he is  --  well , he is famous , " she added after a thoughtful pause . And then she told me how he came to be here . " It was really sort of creepy at dinner , " she said . " Everybody was on good behavior for Sol 's sake . I thought Burnsey'dhave apoplexy , holding back . You know he is the foulestmouthedperson on earth . And he gets so drunk . " Now as we proceeded across the room , I noticed that the man I had observed before standing aloof in one corner had detachedp108himself with a shrug both from the wall and from an importuning Rappaport ( the same assistant director who had bawled me out that afternoon ) and , throwing the phrase , " Figure it out yourself , Rense , " languidly over his shoulder , was making his way in our general direction . There was an indescribable grace and attractivenessabout this man , and there is hardly any way I can outline these qualities without feeling that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair turned almost white , he had a face which fell just short of being too handsome ; what I guess saved him from a matinee idol 's flawlessness of line were his eyes , which were frosty blue and looked intensely outward instead of dreamily inward  --  like the eyes of most beautiful men  --  and surveyedthe world with caution , with curiosity , and with pessimism . He was a tallish man , rather gangling . As he walked toward us he ambled in the fashion of an amateur champion tennis player  --  a slovenly gait redeemed by a natural athletic gracefulness . His shoes squeaked ; a cigarette holder drooped , cigaretteless , from his skeptical lips . There was something powerfully sensual about him ( I felt Rosemarie come electrically alive at his approach , somewhat , I should say , like a mare ) but this quality too was cautiousand in restraint , as if having seen all , done all , tasted almost all there is to taste , he had gone into semi-retirement from the fray , as a wise man of forty-five should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly experienced . I was surprised by his voice ; it was softer , higher-pitched than his build would lead one to imagine , and it did not say , " Hiya , " but murmured a restrained , perfectly affable " I 'm very glad to meet you , " as with the merest whisper of a smile he shook my hand . " Oh , Alonzo ! " Rosemarie exclaimed . " You 're not going to bed so soon . " " I 'm going to try , darling , " he said . " But there 's no need , you know , Alonzo dear . You said you wo n't be shooting until tomorrow afternoon . " " I wo n't be doing even that if the weather stays like this . " He took a deep breath , as if to sniff the overcast . " Everybody 's going swimming down at the pool . Please stay , Alonzo . You know , you 're just my favorite person alive . Come on over with Peter and me and let 's have a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft pleasant voice , " for twenty years I 've been fighting a war with insomnia . I tried alcohol , until it threatened to land me on Skid Row . I tried sleeping pills until they became such a burden that the cure was worse than the sick-P109ness . Now all I can do is go to bed and lie there staring at the ceiling until dawn , but there 's an outside chance , as always , that I 'll sink into slumber . You would n't want to deny me that chance , would you , by luring me again into these nocturnal , meretricious ways ? " " Well  --  " she began . " Well of course not , Alonzo . " But the look on her face was one of such disappointment that , relenting , he sighed : " O.K. , I 'm weak , darling . " He took her by the arm . " Fetch me a plain glass of soda with ice . With a twist of lemon . But mind you , Rosemarie , " he added , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off on what they call a depressive cycle , I 'm going to lay the blame right on your doorstep . " Drifting toward the bar , where a white-jacketed waiter from the Bella Vista held forth , Cripps inquired if I was the friend of Mason who had had the accident on the road . When I said that I was , he shook his head sympathetically . " Rosemarie told me about it . It 's a hellish thing to have happen . I 've been lucky in Europe so far , but during the war , in Algeria , I was in a jeep that hit a child . It did n't kill the boy but it broke him all up . I know how you must feel . It makes you sick to your soul . Are you insured , by the way ? " " Yes , I am , " I said . " Then you 're fortunate . You ca n't blame them for suing , of course , but the sad fact of the matter is  --  as you probably know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if he 's in the right . I hope your boy gets well , poor bastard . " He sighed again as he took the drink Rosemarie held out to him . " I love Italy and Italians  --  most of them . My favorite wife was Italian , as a matter of fact . But the truth is , you know , contrary to popular belief , that they 're the sickest people on earth . Except maybe for Americans . Every one of them harbors a suicidal mania . A death-wish . That 's why they make such rip-roaring racingdrivers and high-wire artists and trapeze stars . And end up like your boy . Well , cheers . " " Cheers , " I responded , tipping my glass , thinking gloomilyagain of di Lieto . " Why do they make such rotten soldiers , then ? " " That 's a different matter , " he said , running a hand through hishair . " It involves a certain amount of pride . I mean  --  Put it thisway . No Italian wants to kill himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few paces off to the side now I noticed that there was beingenacted a strange , tense , and quiet scene . Here half a dozen people had gathered and were standing in a rough semicircle arounda small low chess table and two opposing chairs . On one of thep110chairs was sitting a sweating , black-haired young Italian ; on the other chair sat Carleton Burns : between them on the table they had propped their elbows and  --  perspiring , panting heavily , their faces crimson from the strain  --  were locked in a game of handwrestling , Indian-style . As Cripps and I both turned to watch them , I was able for the first time to observe the face of Carleton Burns straight-on , undistracted , and at close range . And what a face it was ! Red from exertion ( desperately and grimly he strove to press the Italian 's arm to the table ) , from booze , his face had the complexion now of a ripe tomato , and he snorted with the strain , and allowed a trickle of spit to ooze from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched his writhing , mobile expressionand his inflamed , startlingly homely features  --  from his eyebrowsthat sprang up wildly like a satyr 's down to his chin which , as in the mug shots of certain criminal psychopaths I had seen , seemed to melt into his neck  --  I obtained a rapid series of impressionsof the man that began with the sense of something diabolical then ranged to corrupt then to just perversely mean . And as I watched the struggle , as I looked at Burns , who despite all his marks of dissipation seemed to possess a wiry strength , and saw him gradually and with a trembling shudder of his muscles force his opponent 's arm toward the table , I wondered that such an ugly man should have been always cast as a hero and a lover , until I recalled the recent shift in cinematic fashion which had apotheosized the blackguard , the stupid , and the sidewise look of villainy . Suddenly with a thump , triumphant , Burns forced down the Italian 's hand , gasping , " That got you , spaghetti-head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the group around them ; as the defeated sweating Italian forked over a fistful of lire , Burns gazed around the crowd with a jaunty smirk and with greenish , bloodshot eyes . " Anybody for a little hand wrestling ? " he said , and belched . " Anybody else want to take on Daddy-O ? " " You 're too good , Burnsey , " said the Italian as he replaced his . wallet with a drained and sheepish look . " You should go into business for yourself . No kidding , Burnsey . " " How ' bout getting me another drink , Freddie ? " Burns mumbledto someone lingering at his shoulder , a skinny youth with long sideburns and a glassy , sycophantic expression . Turning back to the Italian , he said : " No , Lombardi , you goofed . You got to , keep your wrist straight , like I told you . It 's all in the wrist .

" Tell us the secret of your fabulous success , Burnsey , actually , " she said in a wry voice . She looked at him intently and rather sadly . " It 's one-third muscle tone and one-third brains and one-third anchestry , " he replied thickly . His benumbed lips scarcely moved . " I 've got Chippewa blood in me . That 's no jazz . Ask anybody that knows . Good old Chippewa blood , full of crazy red corpuscles . That 's what you skinny chicks need , Maggie . Good old hot . . . Chippewa . . . blood . " His chin sank down upon his chest . " Somebody might plug in on your socket every now and then . " " Oh shut up , " said the girl , turning pink . She half-rose from the low stool upon which she was sitting , thought better of it , and sat down again with her back turned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  he belched again  --  " is a mercy hump . " " Just shut up , " she said , with a catch in her voice . Her distress was as transparent as a glass : she was in love with the odious man . Burns straightened himself enough to down in one swift gulp the drink that Freddie brought him ; then , stretching back in his chair , he looked up at Cripps and grinned . His eyes were filmed and his face was more flushed than ever , and it was a mystery to me how in his soaked condition , Chippewa or not , he had managed to win at his strenuous game . " Hullo , Alonzo . How 's your hammer hanging ? I thought you 'd gone to bed . " " I stayed up so I could watch you , " Cripps said in a level voice , without humor . " I always like to see you when you 're at your most suave . " " Want to hand-wrestle for fifty male lire ? " " No thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the hell is Mason ?

I think it would be a whole lot better all around if you just went to bed . You 'll be dead tomorrow . " " Will you for Christ sake please stay off my back , mother ? Where the hell is Mason , baby ? " he said , looking at Rosemarie . " Daddy-O wants a cool plunge . " Imperceptibly his voice hadp112thickened and he had sunk by degrees down into his chair so that now , his hairy legs asprawl , neck and shoulders almost on the cushion , he was in a position not far from the horizontal . " Where the hell has Mason disappeared to , baby ? " We looked at Rosemarie . She flushed and stiffened . Her eyes grew wide with some undiscoverable but discomfiting emotion and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agape , I realized for the first time that she not only did know where Mason was but had dark private reasons for being silent about it . " Oh , I  --  well I do n't know , " she stammered . " I mean , I think he went up to the Bella Vista . " " Well , tell him to chop-chop down here and take a cool plunge with Daddy-O . He 's about the only one who wears pants around here that 's not a fag . Mason and me . Only ones around here not raving fags . And Freddie . Is n't that right , Freddie ? " he said , craning his neck upward . " Well , gee-whiz , I do n't know , Burnsey , " said Freddie , looking warily and apologetically at Cripps . " Now as for good old ' Lonzo , " said Burns , gazing up at him with a loose slack-lipped smile . " I 'm beginning to think he 's the biggest fruitcake of all . That 's what I think about old ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he simpered in a high lilting voice . " Play me a tune on the old skin flute . Say , Freddie , go up the hotel and get me my bongo drums . Me and ' Lonzo gon na jive with the old skin flute . " I watched Cripps ' expression as Burns continued to bait him ; his face wore a look now of faintly amused , faintly weary patience , as if he had been through this many times before , and he squinted at Burns through a blue haze of cigarette smoke with cool slit-eyed nonchalance . It was all in all an impressive portrait of equanimity . " C'm on ' Lonzo , " Burns said . " Own up . Come clean . Ai n't you a big frooty-matoot ? Gobble my  --  " Without a word Cripps strode over to the place where Burns was sitting , or sprawling , and with one swift jerk of his hand at the folds of Burns ' sport shirt drew him to his feet . He plucked him , I should say , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant did it appear to me that he lost his serene almost gelid composure , and as he spoke to Burns , with his eyes two inches away from those of the actor and blue and level upon him , I could have sworn that he was smiling  --  a thin smile , to be sure , but a smile . " Look here , Burnsey , " he said softly . " Do you want to knowp113something ? I care for you . You 're my pal . Am I penetrating ? Am I reaching you ? Do you read me ? " Dazed and confounded by the turn of events Burns tried groggilyto reply , but he only managed to run his tongue nervously over his lips . " Do you read me , Burnsey ? " Cripps repeated . " Roger , ' Lonzo , " Burns said finally , with one limp hand raised haphazardly , essaying a salute . " Wilco over and out . " Then swayingthere he attempted to say something else , which ended up an incoherent gurgle . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . " Read you loud and clear , " he croaked . " Well then , fine . Listen to what I 'm saying , Daddy-O . I like you . With you I feel a very close bond . I would lay down my life for you , which is more , I suppose , than I could expect in return . I really care for you , you see ? But with all of this kinship I feel , there are times when you are disgusting . There are times in fact when you are so surpassingly repellent that it takes all my will power to keep from kicking you in the teeth . This is one of those times . Now you go to bed , hear ? " " I go to bed , hear , " Burns echoed mesmerically , in a faint voice . " That 's right . You go to bed . " He gave Burns a feather-light tap on his chest so that the befogged actor , tottering backwards , half-stumbled , half-fell into the outstretched arms of Freddie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said crisply . " Take his shoes off and put him to bed . " Converted in the space of a wink , it seemed , from a tough swaggering hoodlum with a virulent sneer to a faltering and harmless drunk , Burns straightened himself partially , readjusting the drape of his sport shirt with fumbling hands , and once more morosely licked his lips . What looked like tears had welled up in his eyes , although this may have been only his habitual rheum . " Oh ' buddy ' Lonzo , " he said . " Sonofabitch . Oh ' mother . Love ya . Love ya , Daddy-O . " " Go to bed , " said Cripps more gently . " Go to bed , pal . " " Sorry , Daddy-0 , " he mumbled . " Did n't mean  --  " But then he stopped , utterly at sea . Freddie turned him slowly about . Contrite , vanquished , mumbling unintelligibly and swaying top-heavy on Freddie 's supporting arm , he lurched off across the room . Somewhere in the spacious distance I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Burnsey darling ! " I heard her exclaim as she took his arm . Then the three figures ,  |p114weaving  like skaters across the glassy floor , were lost to sight . For me the whole tense little tableau had been rather hollow and disappointing . I do n't know just what else I expected but it did seem to me remarkable that Burns  --  so resourceful , so quickwittedin his professional roles  --  had been reduced to such shamblingdebris before my very eyes . In any case , I had little time to reflect on this matter , for a murmurous message had run through the gathering : everybody was going swimming . Turning round toward the window I saw the swimming pool , set like a huge and sparkling amethyst in the garden below , looking for all the world as if it graced some lawn in California and shining splendidly from a host of floodlights . Casually then , in twos and threes , still clutching their drinks , the guests drifted out from the room  --  fair Alice Adair escorted by the crew-cut young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloria Mangiamele , giggling , superbly undulant , her arm entwined about the waist of Burns ' demolished Italian . I had more than half a craving to see Gloria in a bathing suit but I was still a little tired , determinedly a non-swimmer ; besides , I felt hardly close enough to these people to manage an awkward word or two , much less to splash about with them in the intimacy of a pool ; and so I contented myself with another drink , which I poured into my glass at the empty bar , feeling lonesome and abandoned as I listened to the bright noise of hilarity floating up from the bathhouse down the slope . After a moment 's indecisionI wandered out through a French door to the open balcony , where I thought I would watch the scene , and it was here beneath a dim orange lamp that I re-encountered Alonzo Cripps . He was standing alone at the railing . " That 's a remarkable sight , is n't it ? " he said , gesturing toward the sea as I came toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing boats lay spread out upon the black surface of the night ; invisible itself , each boat bore a dazzling light to summon the fish , so that now lying suspended between the dark water and the moonless and darker sky the whole collection of lights , twinkling there so serenely , had the appearance of a constellation of fat and vivacious stars . There was an immense silence and peace about these lovely hovering lights , and a hypnotic charm . Without taking his eyes from them , Cripps offered me a cigarette . " I never cease to be fascinated by those lights , " he said , " whenever you 're lucky enough to get a black night like this , so that the boats really do look like stars . Wonderful ! I remember seeing them when I first came here during the war . The Army had a rest camp upp115here for a while , you know . I remember that I told myself that I would come back here , if only to see these lights again . They have an amazing floating unearthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous , " I agreed . " Pretty dreary scene back there , " he said without altering the tone of his voice , which was wistful and rather fatigued and stopped just short , it seemed to me , of actual melancholy . " I hope it was n't too dreary . I 'm sorry , what did you say your name was again ? " When I told him , he said : " You were the oddest sort of apparition , you know . Pale as a ghost , dressed like a mortician in the midst of this raunchy crowd . I thought for a while you must have been an acolyte of that old humbug , Bell , until it occurred to me that you were this friend of Mason 's . And then I was really astonished . Have you known Mason long ? " " All my life , practically , " I said . " Well , not really all my life , " I added . " I was at prep school with him near my home in Virginia . Then for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there 's something about Mason that makes you feel you 've known him forever , even when you do n't see much of him . " " I know just what you mean , " he said . " God , I know just what you mean . Where in the world  --  " But he broke off suddenly , wagging his head . There had been more than a trace of sarcasm in his voice . I was puzzled a little , and I could not figure out why he had fallen into this silence , leaving me stranded upon the edge of a small mystery , unless it had been because he had suddenly realizedthe discourtesy involved in running down Mason , who , after all , was his host . Even so , he was unable to resist hinting at something about Mason  --  whatever it was  --  that was bothering him . " I mean , " he resumed slowly , " I mean  --  well , he 's a weird boy . He 's altogether different from the kid I remember down in Virginia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed not to have heard the question or , if he had , chose to ignore it . " Did you ever go to the Flagg place on the river there ? " he said . " What a beautiful place it was . I used to go down every now and then before the war , before old Justin died . What a hard cookie he was . But a good man , really , and I guess I should be forever grateful to him . Actually , in spite of that grim little soldierboyact he had quite decent instincts . Did you know him ? " " Well , I used to sort of see him , " I said . " He suffered , you know . I mean , really suffered , not the imitationsort of anguish you usually get in this business . He was ruth-P116less in his way but there was an odd side of him that was really quite highly principled . Almost puritanical when you come right down to it . I guess that 's the reason he never got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what became of his mother ? Wendy ? " " I have n't seen him enough to talk to him since I 've been here , " I said . " The last I heard she was still lushing it up down on the farm . " " Pathetic woman , " he sighed . " Christ , what misery liquor can cause ! I should know . Even though it 's really the symptom , you know , not the disease . I suppose it 's simply that our disease is more  --  pandemic now , which is why you see such a fantastic goingto pot . Especially among Americans , I mean . The disease being . . . what ? You tell me . A general wasting away of quality , a kind of sleazy common prostration of the human spirit . Like Burnsey there  --  a really sensitive decent guy beneath it all , and very close to a great actor . Yet what does he do ? In his midthirties , just when an artist should be hitting his stride , achieving maturity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hipster . A juvenile delinquent . A dirty-mouth little boy . " He paused , then said : " Ah God , I do n't know how we 're going to finish this  --  I was about to say film . " Then he fell silent . Below us now the guests were converging on the pool . Some were clad in Bikinis ; some were more conventionally decked out , including that fastidious snoop , Morton Baer , who wore no bathingsuit at all but shuffled about in his flannel suit at the edge of the pool and puffed on a cigar . There was laughter , a constant chatter rose in English and Italian , and no one went into the pool ; beneath a spangled cluster of beach umbrellas they had all disposed themselves at tables , attended by the solitary harried waiter . Crazed by the strange blue light , half a dozen moths the size of small bats swooped and flickered , casting their freakish shadows over all . I kept my eyes on Mangiamele , who was practicallynaked and had commenced to lacquer her toenails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind us in the salone . It was not an explosion , but it sounded like one : as Cripps and I jumped , then wheeled quickly about  --  both I think expecting to see fallen plaster and a cloud of smoke  --  we saw only that the huge front doors had been slammed violently open against the walls . Both doors were still vibrating . In front of them stood Cass Kinsolving . He was drunk . Drunk is hardly the word . He was about as drunk as one could get and still stand up  --  beside himp117Burns would have appeared a teetotaler  --  and as he came toward us , his hand clawing at the chairs for support , he wore an expres-sionof such desuetude and abandonment of thought that it waslike no expression , and I could have sworn that he had only thedimmest notion of where he was , and what he was doing , and where he was headed . A ripped and dirty T-shirt  --  it was Marine Corps issue , a faded green  --  exposed his powerful shoulders , but there was something sluggishly decrepit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depleted , as if he had left I the last ounce of his strength in the courtyard below . At one point I thought he was going to pitch forward across a sofa . And I was surprised when , finally lurching over to the balcony where we were standing , he said thickly but with more clarity than ever I thought such a drunken man could muster : " Hello , Leverett . How 's the guy you hit today making out ? " " Hiya , " I said . I will have to be honest about my feelings toward Cass at this point : I thought he was a disagreeable lush and an all-around pain in the neck . He turned to Cripps before I had a chance to reply . " Good evening , Signor Regista , come va ? How 's everything in the flicker business ? Making pots and pots and pots ? " " Va bene , Cass , " said Cripps . " Come state ? Un po ' troppo vino stassera ? " He regarded Cass with a smile , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cass fell against the balcony railing , making it sing and tremble . He gazed at us with drowned hot eyes and a wet lippy grin , pantingand heaving while a tic worked nervously at his brow . " Tell me this , Signor Regista , " he said , still grinning . " What said the chorus when old Oedipus was at Colonus "  --  he seemed fearfully close to pitching backward over the rail  --  " and old Theseus dragged his poor old bones off  --  " " Watch it there , Cass , " said Cripps , reaching out . " For the long days lay up full many things nearer unto grief than joy , ' " he cried , and picked up my glass and downed it in a gulp . " Stand back there , old Buster Brown , old dollbaby ! " Withone hand he sliced the air in front of him , as if with an invisible 11 cutlass , threateningly , causing Cripps to halt . " Stand back there , old great gray cinematic magician , whilst I keen my song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer unto greet '  --  ' scuse me  --  ' grief than joy , but as for thy delights , their place shall know them no more , when a man 's life has lapsed beyond a fitting term ' . . . whoo ! " His arm slid off the railing , recovered itself ; drawing him/self erect he thrust his wrist into the neck of his T-shirt and stood , weaving slightly , in the hot-eyed declamatory pose of an old-time ham tragedian . " Stand back there , I say ! The Deliverer  --  the Deliverer , ' to continue , comes at last to all alike , when the doom of Hades is suddenly revealed without marriage-song or lyre or dance , even Death at last ! ' " He paused , took a breath . " Now for the bleeding beautiful antistrophe . Not to be born is , past all prizing , best , but when a man hath seen the light this is the next best by far , that with all speed he should go thither , whence he hath come . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Cass , " said Cripps , going up to him . " Hold it there , boy . You 're going to land in the garden . " "  --  youth go by . . . ' " He halted . Neck bent back now at right angles he was trying to drain the glass of its last drop ; it was a wide-mouthed glass and the ice cubes perched bizarrely on his eyeglassesand water trickled down around his ears . " lo mi sazio presto di vino , " he said with a gasp finally . " This here Scotch of Mason 's just dandy . Make tears come to your eyes . " He took a step back toward the salone , clutching the glass with two hands before him , like a chalice . " I think I 'll just get me  --  " " Hold on , Cass , " Cripps said . " Do n't you think you 've had about enough ? " As he said this a dry laugh , almost as if in spite of himself , escaped his lips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you  --  " " How ' bout that ? " Cass said , suddenly whirling around . " How ' bout that , old sweet gray wizard of the cinematic art ? Did you catch the faultless phrasing , the accent , the intonation , I mean the simple pure ordinary bleeding poignancy of it all ? Each syllable like a shiny round little nugget blooped out from the divine lips of Garrick hisself ! Put me on ! Put me on , by God ! With my talent and this here profile and your noodle we wo n't have no trouble at all . The girls 'll cram the flicker palaces from sea to shining sea . There wo n't be a dry pair of pants in the house . How ' bout that , old Regista ? " He placed a thick arm on Cripps ' shoulder . " Take my advice , get rid of these here second-raters , these hand-medownsfrom vaudeville , these jugglers and chuckleheads and such trash . Hire you a man , a man like me that could bring forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cripps said , " let me take you  --  " " Hold on ! Let me tell you what we 'll do . Together you and me we 'll pull a Prometheus on ' em . We 'll bring back tragedy to the land of the Pepsi-Cola and the peanut brittle and the Modess Be/cause . That 's what we 'll do , by God ! And we 'll make the ignorant little buggers like it . No more popcorn , no more dreamboats , no more Donald Ducks , no more wet dreams in the mezzanine . Tradegy , by God , that 's what we 'll give ' em ! Something to stiffen their spines and firm up their joints and clean out their tiny little souls . What 'll you have ? Ajax ? Alcestis ? Electra ? I phigenia ? Hooboy ! " Once more his hand plunged into the neck of his T-shirt . " I would not be the murderer of my mother , and of thee too . Suffi-cientis her blood . No , I will share thy fortune , live with thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead thee . . . ' " " Cass , " said Cripps , " what you need I think is a nice long snooze . Now if I were you  --  " " Hold on ! " said Cass again . But then he abruptly fell silent . He scratched his brow . " Plumb forgot what it was I came for . " For a moment he wore a puzzled look ; then suddenly breaking out into a smile , he clapped his thigh and said : " Now , by God , we 'll work a bit of subtle thievery ! Ssst ! " he whispered , bending forward toward Cripps ' ear . " You wo n't tell a soul , will you ? You wo n't breathe a loving word ? " " I do n't read you , " said Cripps , with his melancholy grin . " Is the illustrious proprietor away ? Old Mason , has he gone away ? " He giggled a little , ceased , his face becoming mysterious and grave . " When the rat is away , Regista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " old tomcat will play . Now to go fetch the bleeding cure ! " At this he pulled loose from Cripps , turned about , and staggered off away from the balcony . Cripps and I both made quick involuntary motions to stop him , but seconds too late : like a blind and incapacitated bull he blundered straight into the piano bench , pitched forward with the crumpled knees and supplicatingarms of a man shot in the back , and came down flush upon the I 11 keyboard in a thunderous uproar of flats and sharps ; for a split instant he lay outspread there like some disheveled virtuoso gone raving mad and then slid to the floor with a groan , one arm trailing a flashy glissando along the keys . " Sweet heaven ! " Cripps gasped as we went to his aid . But even before we reached his side he was on his feet , listlessly probing for broken bones . " No harm done , Regista , " he said . He gazed dazedly at the piano . " I think I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cripps said . " Downstairs with you now . " Together , with Cripps on one side and me on the other , we maneuveredhim back toward the open door . His breath came in short gasps , and he reeked of wine and sweat.  | " Take my advice , " Cripps said . " Hit the sack . " Cass , still prodding himself , halted at the edge of the steps . " Yeah , " he said in a distant voice . " Yeah . O.K. " Then with great care , hugging the marble banister , he descended to the courtyard , and Cripps and I were alone . " That boy is slowly killing himself , " Cripps said , shaking his head . " I 've never seen anyone put away so much sauce in all my life , and that includes my old pal Burnsey . " " What 's wrong with him ? " We moved back toward the balcony . " I 'd never laid eyes on him before we came up here the other day . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character . Mason 's got him on some sort of hook . " His face turned bitter and grim . " I saw something so low and contemptible , " he blurted , " so disgusting , really , that you would n't believe me if  --  " His voice trailed off . " How do you mean ? " I said . There seemed to be a lot of mysteriousgoings-on around this weird palace , and I wanted to be let in on them . " Oh nothing , " he said . He cast a glance at his watch . Then for no reason at all , or as if the watch had allowed him a sudden privateinsight , he said : " It 's the age of the slob . If we do n't watch out they 're going to drag us under , you know . " Delivered of this , he fell gloomily silent . Back in the village the clock struck the hour . As Cripps turned again , brooding silently on the far hoveringlights , I felt I had never seen a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chime 's single vibrating note died and becamestill : it was one , it was morning . Out of some window now on the level directly below us Don Giovanni came again , impassioned , alluring , boisterous , also very loud , as if someone had turned it loose full-blast in outrage . Rinfrescatevi ! I heard Leporello boom above the flutes and strings . Bei giovinotti ! And out across the starlessnight it went , rebounding from the moon-patched slopes across the valley , so far and still so close , and down across the coast above the boats and the twinkling lights  --  Ehi caffe ! Cioccolatte !  --  and on and on , for all I knew , to Calabria and to Sicily . And at this upsurge of sound the golden people near the pool started , turned with puzzled questing faces like a herd of beasts around a water hole , frozen in stiff alarm . " Look at them , " Cripps said slowly . " You know , that boy is n't too far off , after all . Look at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and what do you get ? A void . . . cosa da nulla . . . nothing . . . We are not even barbarians . Wep121are mountebanks . " He yawned . " Well , I guess I 'll try to go to bed . Did you ever have insomnia ? " " Not often , " I said . " Let me give you some advice . Form regular habits , do n't try too hard for anything , forget about  --  well , honesty , or effort , or it 'll all get you like it 's got me . You know , I lie there and doze off into something that 's not quite sleep and I have a dream . In this dream I am always a victim . A golf pro and a crooner and a drum majorette are all contesting for my soul . Night after night . Sometimesit 's the crooner who wins out , sometimes the golf pro . But more often it 's the drum majorette . She just stands there and wigglesher behind , and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen  --  " Don Giovanni had ceased . Now wild and woeful and with scandalousspine-chilling beauty , a hillbilly song had erupted on the night , athrob with shrill messianic voices , male and female , and the strumming of steel guitars . Perhaps it was pure volume alone , or some left-over nostalgia for this music from my native shires , but I thought I had never heard anything at once so lovely and so horrible , and my mind began to swarm with southern weather , southern voices , southern scenes : This question we daily hear , no one seems to know . Wha-a-at 's the matter with this world . . . Country beer joints , pinewoods , dusty back roads and red earth and swamp water and sweet-fragrant summer ducks : my mind was smothered , overwhelmed by memory . " My Lord , " I said to Cripps , " what 's that  --  " " Shh-h , " he said . " Listen  --  " Now this rumor we hear : another war we fear , Revelations is being fulfilled . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking sand , the end is drawing near : That 's what 's the matter with this world . . . Pale faces turned toward the source of this anathema , the peoplebelow attended to the horrendous noise : a sport-shirted Italian mouthed a voiceless imprecation , another joined him , red-faced ; La Mangiainele clapped her hands over her ears.  |p122The  precious of Bahble says : Sin will have to go  --  Wha-a-at 's the matter with this world . . . Across all Italy the music seemed to stream , filled with dolor and distress , jangling guitars and wild apocalyptic voices joined in one long throbbing lament  --  bathos brought full circle and back into a kind of crippled majesty . I listened until shameful tears swam in my eyes . And then abruptly , and with the jagged uproar of a phonograph needle scraping like a raw blade across the evening , the music was strangled off , perished , and we heard drunken muffled shouts in the room below . " Scum ! " It was Cass ' voice . " Swine ! Scum of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Don Giovanni filled the night , and the people around the pool relaxed , resumed their murmurous chatter amid the shadowy swoopings of the giant moths . " That boy is killing himself , " said Cripps . " What can you do ? He could stop Mason in his tracks , and all his breed . But look at him . He 's killing himself . " Then he said good night to me , and then he was gone . It was not long after Cripps left that a really rather distressing thing occurred . What happened was this : after watching Cripps walk away , I lingered on the balcony for a while , brooding over the people around the pool . I listened  --  I should say I was belaboredby the music : once again it became raucous and loud , and the voices of Elvira and Masetto and Ottavio , screeching like alleycatswhile the detestable grandee went about his seduction , boomed up and around me , and washed away the sounds from the pool below . I watched the lights floating out upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time sunk in the profoundest gloom  --  primarily because of Cripps , who in an odd and oblique way had so mutilated my happy expectation of America that , if memory serves me right , I concocted all sorts of alternatives : anotherjob in Rome , marriage to a princess somewhere , headlong flight to Greece . I was mired in despondency , my throat was itchy and sore . But after a short time my sadness diminished : to hell with Cripps , I thought , and I turned to make my lonesome way back down among the movie stars . It was several moments later , after I had passed through the long room , that a door burst open a few feet away from me , exposing a glimpse of an ascending stair/way , and a girl of eighteen or twenty , who came skidding out into the room as if upon glass , slipped to the floor in a heap , and then leaped up and rubbed her elbow , sobbing as if her heart would break . She was almost faultlessly lovely ; even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there indecisively with her brown eyes round with hurt and terror , wrung my heart with yearning . I put out my hand to steady her , for she seemed to be on the verge of toppling once more , but she drew back instantly and threw a hunted , despairing look toward the staircase . Her dress was black and of poor quality , such as that which servants wear ; through a rip in the bodice practically all of one of her full , heavy , and handsome breasts was laid bare , and for the entire ten seconds that she stood there , paralyzed , it seemed , by panic and indecision , I too felt rooted there and speechless , torn both by a futile , gallant desire to help and by the beast inside which drew my eyes down to that delectable , troubled bosom . Then , suddenly covering herself , still furiously sobbing , she struck herself in the face . " Dio mio ! " she cried in a frenzy . " Questa e la fine ! Non c'e rimedio ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah my God , please , " she exclaimed in English . " No , please , do n't  --  " And then , recovering control , breathless , she pushed past me with a little groan of anguish , her brown hair in a scattered , lovely tangle about her face as she took to her heels again , bare feet patteringin diminishing terrified flight down the hallway . She had spun me around like a top , and I came to rest on a marble bench , still vibrating . Before I could rise , I heard a thunderous noise once more on the stairs , as of trunks and boxes tumbling down . It was a hell of a racket ; the whole palace seemed to be in eruption . Then Mason burst forth , skidding too on the glassy floor , throwing out his arms wildly and righting himself as he slid to a stop before me . Three Band-Aids plastered his face . His hair flew out in all directions . He was clad in a silk dressing gown both too short for him and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exposing a thicket of reddish sweating hair , and I could see , below , his knobby knees . Rather incongruously , his feet were shod in wooden shower clogs , which is what accounted for all the noise . " Where is she ! " he snarled at me , his face red and ugly . " Who ? " I said . I had drawn back nervously on the bench . I had never seen him quite like this before : he wore a brutish , wild expression , and with his red-rimmed eyes and arm cocked threateninglyI thought he was going to paste me one where I sat.  | " Where did she go ! " he yelled . " Tell me , you bastard ! I 'll kill her ! " " I 'll swear to God , Mason , " I said , " I just do not know . " " You 're lying ! " And then with a strange , painful , bowlegged gait , infinitely stiff and slow , he moved toward the hallway down which the girl had disappeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I come back I expect to stomp out of you a fat amount of your yellow and treacherous shit . " There was a kind of a smile on my host 's face but pure malice and venom were in his voice , and hatred . . . . Maybe you recollect that dream of betrayal which I described early in this story  --  of the murderous friend who came tapping at my window . Somehow when again I recall that dream and then rememberMason at this moment , I am made conscious of another vision  --  half-dream , half-fantasy  --  which has haunted me ever since I left Sambuco . It goes like this : I have taken a picture of a friend with one of those Polaroid cameras . While waiting for the required minute to elapse I have wandered into another room , and there I pull out the print all fresh and glossy . " Ha ! " or " Well ! " or " Look ! " I call out expectantly to the other room . Yet as I bend down to examine the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the face of some balefuland unearthly monster . And there is only silence from the other room.  | " Holy God , " said Cass one day , as I recalled that evening for him , " was I as bad as all that ? " " I would n't say bad , " I replied . " Not bad . As I recall it you were even quite eloquent , in a soggy way . But  --  well yes , you were blind , all right . " He reflected silently for a long time on what I had told him . " That piano , " he said finally . " Falling all over that piano . I do n't remember a thing about it . I swear . " " If you 'd done that sober , you 'd have been in the hospital for a week . " " And that string music . Jesus , I 've still got it somewhere , down underneath the Buxtehude . What 's the Matter with This World ? ' Wilma Lee and Stoney Cooper . I got that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war when I was visiting my cousin up there . Carted it all around Europe with me , too . But I 'll swear I ca n't remember ever playing it over there . And that night  --  " " You played it all right . Boy , you played it . " " Holy God . " He fell silent for a while , then he said : " What time do you suppose that was ? What time of the evening ? " " Morning , I 'd say . Somewhere around one o'clock . " He wrinkled his brow and then looked at me intently . " All right then , that was the last time you saw Mason before  --  before he was dead . When you saw him chasing off after Francesca . Is that right ? " " That was Francesca , then ? " I countered . " The girl he killed ? " His face for a moment seemed unutterably weary and somber . It was his first reaction of this kind since I had come to Charleston ; partly through me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and at this moment I could only vaguely sense how much he had cared for the girl . " It was her , " he said rather despondently , " it could n't have been anyone else . Did you see her again ? " " I do n't think it was too long afterwards . With you . " " Where , for God sake ? " " Down in that courtyard . You  --  " I paused . It was an awkward thing to say , and I did n't know if he wanted to hear it . " You kissed her . Or she kissed you . Believe me , I was n't spying , " I added , " I happened to be  --  " " No , of course not . But  --  " With puzzlement all over his face , he ran his fingers through his hair . Then after a moment he said : " Wow , you know it is all coming back now . In bits and pieces and little flickers , you see . " He fell silent again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose from his chair and began to pace around the clutteredfishing shack . It was raining , and the roof leaked , and water dripped down the back of my neck . " Like what you just said , for instance . 1 'd forgotten that , too . A total and complete blank . Of course ! I did see her . I did see her . And  --  " His voice trailed off . " And what ? " He scratched his chin . " And she  --  Look , " he said , " this is important . Try to be as accurate as you can . How long do you think you were at that party ? That is , before you saw Mason and he holleredat you . " I brooded , straining to be exact . " It must have been eleventhirtyor so when I came in with Rosemarie . " I paused . " And about  --  oh , sometime after one when Mason came downstairs after Francesca . A little less than two hours , I 'd say . But why  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , gesturing for silence . Then after a bit he turned to me with a wan sad grin , and said : " Now tell me this , will you . When was the last time you saw Ma-son ? " I started to tell him , again with some embarrassment . " Well , at least that 's an easy one . It was when he made you go into your trained-seal act . When he made you  --  " I faltered , horribly . " Oh Jesus , yes , " he blurted , " Poppy once told me a little about that . It got so awful I did n't ever let her finish . " He paused , somewhatagitated now , stroking his bare arms . " That was when  --  when you rescued me , I guess . I do n't remember that , but I do remember it afterwards , when you were sobering me up . And after this exhibition I put on you never saw Mason again ? " " Only when he was stiff and cold . " Somber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming windows . " Somewhere , " he said slowly , " at one point along in there somewhere she told me something . " He struck his head shortly with his hand , as if to dislodge the memory . " She told me something . . . " I was utterly baffled about all this , and my silence must have betrayed my bafflement , for in a moment he turned and said in an even voice : " You 've got to excuse this , you know . I 'm not pulling your leg , really . " He ran . some water in a pan and , sitting down besideme , began to eviscerate a large croaker . " I 'm going to level with you about something , " he went on . " It 's not something I 've ever wanted to think about , much less talk about . Maybe it 's better this way  --  get it out of the system . But  --  well , it 's like this , you see . That trained-seal act , as you call it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It started out O.K. , we were even sort of buddies at first . But then  --  something went wrong . What with the booze and the weird condition I was in he began to stomp me  --  I mean really stomped me , and I let him  --  and it got so bad I was paying him for the time of day . A regular peon I was , if you want to know the truth . " He paused . " I 've never known anyone in my life I ever hated so much . " He became silent , sweating over the fish . " So  --  " I said . " I ' 11 tell you about that sometime . But now  --  Anyway , the point is this : a while back you said something about how it shocked you , Mason doing what he did and all . How though you could credit him with an ordinary red-white-and-blue Americanstylerape you could n't see him doing it in the all-out monstrousp128way he did it . Well , when you said that , it rang a bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , that was the way I felt too . I hated his guts , he was the biggest son of a bitch I had ever run across ; but later I could n't see him doing that . What he did took something Mason did n't have . His cruelty and his meanness was a different kind . Only  --  " He fell silent again , the cords of his arms standing out as he strained away with the knife . " Bleeding croaker , " he said at last , as if wishing to banish the subject for good . " Hardly worth the trouble . Skin on a croaker 's like  --  " I may have been mistaken , but I thought for a moment he was going to weep . " Only what ? " I persisted . " Look , Cass , like you say , you can level with me . I 'm not trying to worm something out of you that you do n't want  --  " " Only this , " he said , turning calmly to face me . " Only I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all that . Maybe he had it in him , after all . Everything you say  --  all of this stuff I was blind to  --  makes it plain that rape was on his mind from the word go . She would n't give in to him , so he would take it . That afternoon , for instance ; what he said there to Rosemarie that time , just before he belted her . And then this thing you told me about  --  chasing after her down the stairs . He said , I 'll kill her . ' Is n't that what you said ? And then  --  " " Then what ? " " Nothing much , " he said in a bemused voice . He turned to me again . " Put it this way , " he said . " Maybe I 'm just being a scoundrel . Maybe I 'm just being un-Christian . Maybe I just want to make sure that he really was a monster . " " Monster ? " I said . Cass appeared to have lost his reticence about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . " Tell me , " I said , " he really gave you a rough time down there , did n't he ? " He seemed to ponder the question for a long moment , turning over all the angles , absorbed . " Yes , I reckon he did . But how much of all that was due to my own corruption , this old corruption of mine  --  how much of the whole ruination was my blame I 'd like to know . Maybe I 'll tell you about that too sometime , when I 'm able to be sensible about it and recollect it . " He halted to wipe the wet scales off his knife , and dried his hands . " It 's really curious , you know , " he went on , now in a somber monotone , " this business about evil  --  what it is , where it is , whether it 's a reality , or just a figment of the mind . Whether it 's a sickness like cancer , somethingP129that can be cut out and destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether it 's something you ca n't cure at all , but have to stomp on like you would a flea carrying bubonic plague , getting rid of the disease and the carrier all at once . Not too long ago , as time goes  --  you 're a lawyer , you know all this  --  they 'd hang a ten-year-old for stealing a nickel 's worth of candy . Right there in Merrie England , France too . This was the plague theory , I guess . Stomp on the evil , crush it out . Now a kid goes out on the streets  --  he 's not even ten , most likely he 's twenty and he goddam well knows better  --  and he commits some senseless and vicious crime , murder maybe , and they call him sick and send for the head doctor , on the theory that the evil is  --  well , nothing much more than a temporary resident in the brain . And both of these theories are as evil as the evil they are intended to destroy and cure . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the life of me I do n't know of any nice golden mean between the two . " " How does all of this apply to Mason ? " " Well first  --  Let me explain a little something . I do n't mean to be blowing my own horn , or singing the blues , either , but  --  well , I 've come up where I am  --  I ' 11 admit it is n't very far  --  pretty much the hard way , as I guess you know . I did n't get past the second year up there in this miserable little high school in North Carolina , even now I have the toughest time writing and punctuating and so on . But I did learn to read and I 've read a lot on my own hook , and I guess I 've read ten times what the average American has , although God knows that could Mean only one book . Anyway , I guess one of the big turning points in my life was right after the war , when I got discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling you about , in California . There was this chief noodle specialist there  --  one hell of a guy . He was a Navy captain , name of Slotkin . I 'd told him about my schoolboy interest in painting , and he got me in one of these therapy painting classes , and I reckon I was a painter from then on out . That 's how I ended up after the war in New York instead of back in Carolina , I guess . Anyway , we could n't come to any agreement whatsoever about my melancholia or whatever it was , with its manic-depressive overtones , but I had a lot of long talks with him , and there was some patient gentle quality the guy had that almost swung me out of my blues , and just before I left the place  --  uncured  --  he gave me a two-volume edition of Greek drama . Its was quite irregular and all , I guess , this gift from a full Navy captain to a buck private in the Marines , but I guess he saw something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Freud . I remember he told me this : Read this when you 're down and out . ' Something like : The fact of the matter is this , you know , we have n't advanced any farther than the Greeks , after all . ' Which you 've got to admit is pretty cool talk , coming from a reverend brain doctor . He was quite a sweet guy , old Slotkin . " Anyway , when you mentioned how I started quoting at length from Sophocles that night , it all came back to me . The sweat and the horror and this bleeding awful view into the abyss . Long before I ended up in Sambuco I 'd memorized great hunks and sections . out of those two volumes . And when you saw me that night I was really in a bad way  --  as blind-drunk off of Oedipus as I was off of booze . " He paused and fingered ruminatively at the edge of the knife . " Yet here 's the thing , you see . Let me explain if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost prayerfully , as if coaxing reluctant memories from the confusion of the past . " I was so completelyblind . Stoned . Something you said . . . which has to do with this evil I was talking about . " His eyelids parted , and he turned . " Yes , I think I 'm getting some of it . More of it 's coming back now . I do remember just in the dimmest way going upstairs . The piano , no . But Oedipus , and Cripps , and you  --  yes , a little . " He shook his head . " No , there 's some connection I ca n't make yet . Jesus Christ , you 'd think we were having a bleeding seance . I was trying to search for something that night . . . But now it 's all gone again . Do you think it could be that I had come up there to chew Mason 's ass out with a little Oedipus ? No , I doubt it . " He shook his head again , violently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of drunken truth that I 'd dredged up out of that play , and that it sure as hell had to do with evil , and that Mason . . . " He stopped and , very calmly , lit a cigar . " But I might be mistaken , " he added . " What did you really think of Mason ? " he said then , turning . " Oh I just do n't know , " I said . " I do n't know how to explain him , I never have known . He was a jerk . A big spoiled baby with too much money and a lot of pretensions . He was the world 's worst liar . He hated women . He was a lousy mess . And yet  --  " " Yet what ? " " Yet he was great fun to be with sometimes . He was entertainingas hell . But he was more than an entertainer . Remove all the other stuff and he might have been quite a guy . " " How long did you know him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I knew him a couple of years atP131school . And then for a week or so in New York , right after the war . I ca n't recall how long exactly . Ten days . Maybe a couple of weeks . We 'll call it a week . And then that day in Sambuco . And that was all . But  --  " I paused . " But still and all there was something about him . I mean you could see him for twenty-four hours and he would reveal more about himself than most people do in a lifetime . He was a  --  " I halted . I really did n't know what he was . " Tell me about him , " Cass said . " Well , it 's not really a whole lot , " I said . " I do n't think I could exactly  --  " " Tell me anyway , " he said . So I tried to tell him . I tried to tell him everything I could remember . I told him how at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week end down in Virginia and how , though we wrote each other for a while ( he was in Palm Beach , Havana , Beverly Hills , New York , usually with Wendy ; his letters were lewd and comical ) , our correspondence petered out and he dropped from sight altogether . I told him , too , how ten years  --  to the month  --  passed before I ran into him after the war , quite by accident , in a New York bar . . . . No doubt it is too easy to say that had I not met Mason again things would have turned out differently , that , having lost touch with one another , we would not have restored our old communion of spirit  --  a dignified phrase for " palship " or some other term equally American and specious , but which , once re-established , allowed him to invite me down to Sambuco . Most of our existence , though , is made up of such imponderables ; the important thing is that we met again . It was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Agency job and sailed for Europe . I had very little money at that time but a job with a veteran 's counseling service allowed me to eat after a fashion and to rent a tiny cardboard apartment on West Thirteenth Street . It was a humid season , with muggy twilightscrowned high with thunderheads and a grumble of storms that never came , wilted faces along the avenues , and windows thrown open on the heat-blown air erupting blurred music and voices ballyhooing war , cold war , threats of war . Evenings I tried to read uplifting books in my apartment , but my soul was illequippedfor the stress of loneliness . My room was a place of subterraneanmurk with a view of an airshaft and an adjoining hotel where old men constantly shambled by , scratching themselves , flushing remote toilets . But it was only in part because of my surroundingsthat this time of my life was not a very satisfactory one.  |p132There  are certain periods in youth which are not touched by even a trace of nostalgia , one 's conduct at that time seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly unkempt , and was sour and spiteful to the girls I tried to pick up in Village hangouts . And to top it all , Mason came into my life  --  in a jammed bar on Sheridan Square during an evening 's prowl that had left me more than usually lonesome and disheveled , and with my carcass burdenedwith mean-spirited lusts . Except that he had taken on a little bit more weight , he had not changed at all . He was dressed in an elegant turtle-neck jersey and blue jeans , looking very much the artist from top to toe  --  though an artist with money  --  and he seemed to be enjoying himself . I saw his grinning face through the smoke of the room , one hand held high , flourishing a schooner of beer . Even now I remember how our eyes met in the flicker of a glance , my sudden shock of delightdarkened by a half-hope that he had not recognized me -- both of these feelings almost simultaneous and in such confusion that I had no time to make up my mind whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he was on top of me , thumping me on the back  --  " Hey , Petesy , let 's flap off on a wild one ! " he cried  --  and falling around my shoulders with loud hoots of recognition . " What an absolutely fabulous coincidence , " he said , when he had quieted down . " At a dinner I was at last night I was talking to this guy  --  a very fine painter  --  and we got to talking about the people we had known at school . I said I could n't speak for Princeton , having been eased out my first year . Do you know , I got booted out for the most undistinguished reason . Petesy , dollbaby , let 's face it , I 'm a brilliant man but as far as education goes I 'm simply a horsefly on the ass of progress . " I would have had to be a more stolid individual than I am not to have been warmed by his energy , his big grin , and by the note in his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest affection . I must have smiled , saying : " But , Mason , how did you get in ? " " You mean after I got kicked out of St. A. 's ? Oh , Wendy pulled some wires through one of her relatives and got me into a chic reformschool up in Rhode Island . They drilled you with rifles and all that crap but 1 bore down hard  --  you know , for the glory of Wendy-dear  --  and I got good grades . That , though , Petesy , is what they call a non sequitur . Because I did n't get booted out of college for boffing or drinking or anything sordid . But for my grades ! Grades ! Can you imagine anything so absurd ? And I testedp133out with an I.Q. of 156 ! This gluttonous widow I was week-ending with on Sutton Place just kept me away from the books . Poor Wendy . The old man had kicked in with I do n't know how many bushels of dough to the library , and when she came up to PrincetonI thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Look out , Mason , you 're spilling beer on your pants . How is Wendy , by the way ? " " Oh , she 's fine . She tried to go on the wagon after the old man died . I guess you heard about him . She goes on and off , poor thing , but I have n't had to give her the cure for months and months . Chloral hydrate and Cream of Wheat . You know , it 's a funny thing . You know how she used to absolutely loathe Merryoaks ? Well , after the old man went to his reward , as they say , you could n't get her away from there , absolutely fell in love with the place . Sits down there and slurps Old Crow all by herself , and rides around on this big horse . My wife and I  --  you 'll meet the wife  --  anyway , we were down there last week end . It 's the biggest goddam horse you ever saw . And off she goes , loping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . He 's a seventy-yearoldBelgian and he 's gotten her all interested in something called Zen . I think they shoot arrows at each other . Jesus sake , Petesy , " he chuckled , wiping foam from his lips , " I do n't know who 's sleeping with who down there . I think the horse is getting the best part of it . " He began to shake and tremble with quiet interior laughter . " Ah Jesus , " he sighed , " Petesy , it 's great to see you again . I knew if I ran into you at all it 'd be in a purgatory of the spirit like this . You know , Wendy still asks about you all the time . She had a real sneaker for you , you know ? I think it must have been because you kept your mouth shut . She was so sick and tired of the old man . He kept yowling into her ear all the time , trying to smoke out her psyche , no wonder she took to the sauce . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , " I 'll have to get her up here so she can see you . What with that spooky Belgian and that horse and all that sauce she 'll end up for certain in some laughing academy . " Anyway , " he went on , " that 's beside the point . " He was not drunk ( although he liked drinking , I recalled that even as a boy he was not particularly addicted to it , which always struck me as a noteworthy deliverance ) but a bright hilarity burbled up in his voice , and his eyes were twinkly and agitated . " What I was telling that guy last night is that of all the dozens of little schoolmates I ever had there was only one I 'd walk around the corner to see again . And then I mentioned your name  --  old Petesy  --  and Ip134wondered what you were doing . It 's fantastic ! It 's pure clairvoyance . So what are you doing ? Tell me . " But before I could pop my mouth open to reply he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " he was saying . " Come over here and meet her . " I remember my surprise at the idea of Mason 's being married , and I studied the girl  --  a slow-stirring blonde named Carole who gave me a warmed-over smile and kept displaying her handsome bosom in a sort of habitual shrug of weariness . In the booth beside her sat a red-haired , blanched , unwell-looking young couple in blue jeans  --  I think they were called the Pennypackers  --  who like a pair of caged foxes stared up at me out of the gloom , fixing me with their feral , glittering eyes . They made no word of greeting , but doted on Mason in a conversation thick with small yaps and noises of innuendo  --  about a week end at Provincetown and someonenamed Gus and someone named Wally  --  and finally , when they got up to go , Mason lent them ten dollars from an enormous bankroll ( I thought it must have been a lapse , for even as a boy he had never been so graceless as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battened their little aqueous , lashless eyes in one brief hot glance of conspiratorial greed before slipping out into the night . I recall wondering how these two , who seemed so down-atthe-heeland uninspired , had come to be Mason 's friends , but even before I could begin tentatively to pump him , he had answered my question , saying : " He 's in Theater "  --  he capitalized the noun  --  " he has n't got a cent and he 's a terrible ass but he reads scripts for the Playwrights ' Company . He 's got the first act of this play I 'm writing . If they do n't do it I 'm almost certain Whitehead will put it on next year , once I get it finished . It 's that second act that 's such a ball-breaker . Did you catch those two ? Funny thing is  --  did you notice ?  --  they look exactly alike . I really think she 's his sister . And she 's the weirdest one in the act . Jesus , I 'd love to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff a marshmallow into a piggy bank . " None of Mason 's drolleries were lost on Carole , who punctuated his talk with throaty little commas of mirth and giggles which she employed without stint whenever he opened his mouth . She was a hefty , good-looking girl with milky skin and a rich , contralto , barrelhousevoice and elliptical green eyes that mirrored almost nothingsave an imperturbably confident passion . She looked openmindedand procreative , a soft acquiescent woman , dimly in love . Her raucous voice betrayed her  --  it was pure Greenpoint  --  depressingme about Mason 's taste in mates , though I could n't helpp135feeling a bachelor 's itch and envy over what he had acquired otherwise . " Darling , you fracture me , " she giggled . " ' Di 've another Scotch onna rocks ? " " Actually , these Village dives are n't exactly my dish of tea , " said Mason , ignoring her , " but it 's good for spasmodic kicks , you know , to see the pseudo-intellectual riffraff in operation . " He squeezed my arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a big brawl going on at my place . It 's been swinging ever since last night . Come on , let 's go . " Outside he steadied Carole at the curb . It was a sultry Manhattan night , its stars drowned in a fragile penumbraof neon , its presence odorous with asphalt and drains and a bouquet of gardenias , borne in the hands of a frayed old peddler , floating up to us from the dark . " Baby , do you want something from Max Schling here ? The kid 's Bobo for flowers , " he murmured to me as , fumblingly , she pinned them to her breast , " and , frankly , it 's her only aesthetic indulgence . Anyway , as I was saying , it 's good for kicks , Peter . These people are such fldneurs . Jesus Christ , I may not be any Cocteau or Brecht yet , but at least I 'm serious . " He whistled up a cab . " Come on , let 's get back to the studio . " Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five floors above the street in one of the frowzier nooks of the Village , was the only New York dwelling I have ever seen which successfully combineda garrety , blue jean-and-sneaker attitude toward art with real luxury . It was a lofty , cavernous place which had been the property of a once well-known but now forgotten portrait painter . Much of it  --  the peeling skylight and hideous mahogany paneling  --  Mason had left as he had found it , but the rest  --  wall-to-wall carpeting nearly bottomless to the tread , hidden lighting and elegantChinese bric-a-brac , a Calder mobile and three Modiglianis and yard after yard of fine editions  --  he had furbished himself with great style so that the effect , after panting upward for so many shabby , cabbage-smelling flights , was not of the drab ordinarinessof the atelier one had expected , but of a sudden , rich , and luminescent paradise . One anticipated such a place , say , on Beekman Hill , but not here ; it was as if a maharajah had taken over a flat somewhere in Queens . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fused Beverly Hills and Bohemia : in that dulcet , insinuating light one felt that one could share the lives of the immeasurably fortunate , yet never lose the echo of the rowdy street below , out of which rose , night after night , the muffledp136tunes of a caterwauling juke box and all the tough , sad accents of Sodom . That evening the place was jammed with people but soon after we arrived , Mason  --  disengaging himself from Carole , who by now was quite hopelessly drunk  --  pushed me toward a rear bedroom , closed and locked the door and , turning round to face me , said with a warm grin : " Now we can catch up on old times , Petesy boy . " Perhaps it was the firm bolting of the door but I recall how , even then , the flicker of a dark suspicion passed through my mind , and vanished as quickly as it had come . Being a fairly inwardlookingperson , and one carefully attuned to the psychiatric overtonesin this age , I have often wondered whether there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mason . I think this has bothered me mainly because I am an American , and Americans are troubled by the notion that the slightly fevered excitement , the warmth they might feel in the presence of a friend of the same sex portend all sorts of unspeakable desires . That is why , when Frenchmen kiss or embrace without shame and Italians , long-parted , rush baying into each other 's arms , an American is reduced to a greeting not far removed from a sneer and a sadistic wallop between the shoulder blades . However , in regard to the allure Mason held for me , I have re-examined it from all angles and have found it tainted enough , but not flawed by that complication . I think I simply felt when I was near him that he was more imaginative , more intelligent than I , and at the same time more corrupt ( more corrupt , that is , than I could allow myself to be , as much as I tried ) , so that while he kept me hugely entertainedhe yet permitted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to feel luckier than Mason  --  duller but luckier , and sometimes superior . That night he was at the top of his form . We compared notes on the years since we had last seen each other , but it took only a few moments to cover my own drab career . Mason , however , had lived  --  and I suspected with a dash granted to only a very few young men during the war ; his story , to one who had seen only Illinois prairies , like myself , was fascinating , for he had been a member of the O.S.S. " Oh really , Petesy , I would rather have done time in Leavenworth than been drafted . And gobble K-rations next to some cretin from Opelika , Alabama ? Really , Peter  --  do n't frown  --  we do have to preserve some aristocracy of the spirit . " It had been a difficult stunt to promote because of his college debacle , but one which Wendy , who had known a producer who had known a Gen/eral Something-or-Other at the Pentagon , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said pensively . " She did n't want me to go at all , of course , but she was positively adamant about one thing : she was determined that I get into some outfit where everybody brushed their teeth , even though she had heard that a lot of them were fags . " And then he told a spine-chilling tale about his experiences : about the government school , first , that he attended near Baltimore ( I had heard about it somewhere ) and its incredible curriculum in which neophytes like himself , in order to test their stealth and cunning , were among other things made to break into heavily guarded military installations in the dead of night , or to purloin top-secret blueprints from the shipyard of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation , or , at high noon , with false mustache and eyeglasses and bogus identity badge , to waltz past the guards at the Glenn L. Martin aircraft plant and , once inside , with the furtive skill implantedin their minds at school , to set token bombs and sabotagingbooby traps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before reporting back to their superiors with a key nut or bolt or a crucial cotter-pin , or even  --  as once in Mason 's case  --  with the nameplate of some factory vice-president , as evidence of the success of their mission . " Well frankly , " he said with a laugh , " it was a hell of a lot of fun playing spy . Call it cloak-and-dagger stuff , whatever you want , it really had its  --  I mean , colossal moments of excitement . Of course there  --  at the Division Institute  --  that was the official name but to the public then it had no name at all , in fact it did n't even exist  --  we did n't run any real risk . We had what they call a check agent ' in every installation we planned to knock over ; that is , there was always somebody , usually an F.B.I . man , planted there in some sort of security capacity who knew what was going on . At least he knew that the D.I . was running a speed-job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you bungled the mission and got nabbed he could at least step in and spirit you out of there . " He paused , a ruminative expression on his flushed face , and then began to shake with a kind of tickled , anticipatory laughter . " Oh Jesus , though , some guys really had a rough time of it . There was this little fellow named Heinz Mayer , a funny little German refugee who had been living in Buffalo . He had practicallyno English at all anyway but he was a raving patriot and would have done anything , I think , to get to spit on the Fatherland . Anyway , they sent him on this solo speed-job into an antiaircraft installation  --  No it was n't ; I remember now , it was the Naval Ord/nance Depot down at Dahlgren on the Potomac . Anyway , what happened was that this check agent , this poor benighted F.B.I . man had been stricken with something  --  I do n't know what , appendicitis , a coronary , something  --  at any rate he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heinz got caught snooping around in some building where they were assembling some kind of secret new timing device for eight-inch shells . Oh Jesus , " he chuckled , " I can hear him now , telling us about it : But dere I vass , ' he said , dese Marines , dey tought I vass Chermann ! Dey vould not believe me ven I said dot I vass American , Heinz Mayer from Buffalo , New York . Und I vaited and I vaited for mein shack agent to come and save me but he vould not come ! ' Oh God , " said Mason , " it cracked us up listening to him . I think those Marines were about to give him bastinado with rifle-butts but he got out of there somehow . . . . " It was a lively imitation of the harried little German  --  complete with baffled , cringing gestures . I found myself laughing uproariously . " Well , what then , Mason ? " I said finally . He seemed reluctant to add anything more ; his face became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the play he was working on , to Broadway , and to playwrighting . Yet I was subtly insistent : the intrigue and derring-do of espionage have always been fascinating to me , and I wanted to hear more . " Well , Peter , it 's not all you might have thought , " he said . " Like the Army or anything else it was mainly a matter of beastly  --  I mean , really incessant  --  boredom . Jesus , I 'd like to have a nickel for each of the dead , dead hours I spent sitting on my ass doing nothing but waiting . In Cairo it got so bad , I swear to God , that I got to know every crack in the wall and every bump and every knothole in the bar at Shepheard 's Hotel . Waiting on your ass , waiting on your ass until Franklin and Winston cooked up a big deal  --  and you know it 's all based not on strategy , but on some lousy political nuance  --  a big deal to save some poor , half-strangulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work of the Strategic Services had been paralyzed by inertia , he had managed to go on only one mission , parachuting along with a Serb-American Army corporal behind German lines in Yugoslavia in an effort to discover first-hand the extent of the partisan leader Mikhailovitch 's collaborationwith the Axis forces . " It 's amazing , " he put in suddenly , " talking to people  --  I mean even , say , British G-2 officers who 've done a lot of tough hush-hush stuff and should know better  --  how everyone thinks of the O.S.S. as filled with brawny supermen whoP1339speak seven languages and are adept at judo and are forever prowling some really terror-ridden landscape with a knife between their teeth . Honest to God , Peter , nothing could be further from the truth . I do n't mean to say that there was n't some risk . I mean simplyparachuting out into black space at night is no joy . It was the only jump I ever made and by God you can have it . But otherwise , really , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies . " And he described how , after floating to earth near the town of Dubrovnik on the Dalmatian Coast , he holed up in the seaside villa of a Serb named Plaja in the confidential pay of the Allies  --  " a terrific old barrel-chested guy , " Mason described him , " who 'd been educated at Cambridge and had made an incredible fortune exporting slivovitz "  --  and there for a couple of months lived the life of a total idler , since inauspiciously at that moment Mikhailovitchhad shifted his roving guerrilla headquarters to a point far up in the mountains to the east , where , because of the German troops interposed between , he was beyond reach . " We tried to make contact with the pro-Tito operatives we knew were working undercoverwith Mikhailovitch , " Mason went on , " but it just was n't any go . Stancik  --  that was Jack Stancik , my Serb corporal from Toledo , a wonderful little guy , hard as nails , who used to be a circus acrobat  --  Stancik and I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krauts were really out for blood and the place was hemmed-in like chicken-wire . " So , instead of establishing any sort of liaison with the Tito agents , Mason lolled in prodigal comfortat Plaja 's villa , drenched in the sunshine of the Dalmatian spring , swimming by night out to the cypress-groved islets which dotted the shore , and guzzling slivovitz , the plum-flavored brandy of which Plaja , its chief entrepreneur , served only the most succulentvintages . " Jesus Christ , Peter , " he suddenly burst out , " that was the part that was out of the movies . It was unbelievable . Nazis wandering around everywhere . Here I was literally yards from death , but having the time of my life . And then to cap everything , about five or six days after I 'd been installed there , Plaja 's daughter came on the scene , this magnificent little black-haired dish  --  she was just fourteen  --  with these black saucy eyes and ripe red saucy lips set into a fabulous clear olive complexion that the Yugoslavians in that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like young melons , and a wonderful soft bouncy little tail to go along with it all . I almost blew my top just looking at her , after having subsisted  --  and I mean subsist  --  off these oldp140fungusy Cairo whores for so long . She could n't speak a word of English but we got along in a sort of pig-French -- anyway , to make that part of a long story short : we made goo-goo eyes for a while  --  old Plaja did n't care ; I think he approved of me handsomely , and besides he was always out falconing , which seems to be the favorite divertissement of flush Yugoslavians  --  and then one night after a lot of preliminary billing and cooing and bellyrubbingwe swam out to this little island offshore . Honest to God , the smell of cypresses out there , and plum blossoms  --  it was heady and sexual enough to make you want to positively retch with excitement . Neither of us had bathing suits , so that when we came out dripping onto this moonlit beach we were as naked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Petesy , but you 'd never know it . She just gave a little whimper and melted . It was like taking ice cream from a baby . " And this idyll , he said , lasted for weeks . I was ravished by the picture he drew . So much so that I think I was hardly irritated by his childish descriptions of all the " specialties " he had taught her  --  they can be found in any marriage primer  --  or even disturbed , while he went doggedly on about " these little jawbreakingyelps of passion , " in my vision drawn straight from his eloquence , of looming threat , of plum blossoms and soaring falcons , and cypress-scented seas . " God , Mason , " I breathed , " it 's unbelievable . " " You do n't believe it ? " " Of course I do . " ( And did n't I really ? It must be remembered that , four years before Sambuco , I still possessed a larger streak of gullibility . ) " It 's just that  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , young Mason Flagg of Gloucester Landing , Vir-ginia . " " I know , " he said , musing . " It was really like something out of a book . Sometimes there I thought I was living in a dream . " It was a dream shattered soon , however , for Mason found himselfborne away from this beatific seclusion on the winds of violence . A servant in the villa betrayed their presence one night to the Germans . Only by a matter of minutes had he and Stancik managed to make their getaway : a brief fumbling embrace with the girl , a kiss , a farewell  --  and Mason was gone , together with Stancik , racing and floundering across fields , through olive groves , in a nightmare of confusion and indirection stumbling toward the rescuing British launch that awaited them on the shore , while like avenging and inescapable fury the Germans came on hotly after , inflaming the sky with the pitiless white light of their flares . " Thep141flares were bad enough , " Mason said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maybe they were using riflegrenades . Anyway , we 'd hear this loud crack ! and this was the sign to get down  --  I mean belly-down  --  and stay down , without breathing . Then in about five or ten seconds we 'd hear this little muffled report  --  poot !  --  way up in the sky , and suddenly , even though we were lying out in this filthy wet field , eyes closed tight , we could feel a tremendous hard brilliance floating down from the sky like brightest daylight , covering us . It was strange . Though I could n't really see it because my eyes were closed , I could actually feel this light stealing into my bones and I just waited there  --  praying , I guess  --  waiting for them to blast us . But as I say , that was n't the worst part , somehow . It was these goddam dogs they had . They had these goddam big Dalmatian dogs that they 'd taken from the Serbs and trained as sort of bloodhounds . I 'd seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the villa  --  these great hungry beasts with red-rimmed eyes and liver-spots on their haunches . Anyway , that night they turned them loose after us . We could hear them snarling and groaning and howling in the hedgerows , trying to get our scent . And once when a flare lit up the field I peeked out under my arm and saw one of the bastards , way off but still close enough , standing at the edge of some woods beside some big Kraut with an automatic rifle . I swear I felt my blood turn to piss just looking at him : this great monstrous beast with his fangs glinting there in the light and these big round eyes shining like a couple of silver dollars . He was trained to kill , and he 'd chop through your spinal cord like it was so much cottage cheese . " Yet by the grace of heaven or by luck they managed to get away ; at least Mason did , for his companion Stancik ( they were on the beach by now , hiding behind boulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last foot-weary , bone-tired burst of desperation scrambling toward the Diesel launch whose signal , alreadyseeming to flicker and dim as if with the hopelessness of their plight , beckoned to them from the shore 's edge ) , Stancik fell , slipping into a sort of crevasse in the rock and uttering a wild cry of pain which gave away their position . Mason said he could hear the snap of his leg bone as it broke and , turning to help the corporal , was confronted  --  with a feeling of despair such as he had never known  --  by the blinding glare of a Nazi searchlight shining full upon them . Pinioned there , helpless and in terrible pain , Stanciktried to stir , but his predicament was fatal . As Mason moved toward him in the excruciating light , a blast of machine-gun firep142stitched across the rocks , scattering upon the wind a gritty debris of shale and limestone , sending a bullet through the corporal 's belly : Mason said he saw the fount of blood spurt forth like tar from some mortal arterial hemorrhage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long last diminishing utterance of his identity and being , and then Mason tumbled himself , pierced through the calf of his leg with pain like a blade of fire . " Well , I dragged myself out of there to the boat , " he said . " I still do n't know how I did it . But Stancik , the poor sweet little bastard , he did n't have a chance . All he whispered was , Go on , Lieutenant . Do n't tell anybody that this acrobat fell . ' And then he died . " Mason drew back one cuff of his jeans , revealing above his ankle an ugly round scar , bluish in hue and a little larger than a nickel . " So that , " he added , " is my mementoof the war . To be frank , Pierre , I think I 'm pretty lucky . And this is a nice little token to have around , because whenever it itches , which it does on damp , horrible New York days , I think of Plaja 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow , Mason , " I said , sincerely impressed , " that 's one hell of a story . " " Yeah , " he said , in an offhand manner , " yeah , I suppose it does have all the dramatic elements about it . " He paused and looked at his watch . " Well , I guess you 'd better get back to the party , dollbaby . Look , " he said , " I 'm going to hang around back here for a while . I 'm getting tired of all those freeloaders . If you want me , come on back . " Since this was Mason during what I suppose you might call his Bohemian period , there were , to my intense disappointment , few movie people in evidence ; he had gathered instead a curious and mingled crew . Solitary as ever , I took up my accustomed position , mooring myself in a windless alcove where with practiced hermiticaleye I could watch the ebb and flow of the party . There were floaters of various sexes from the Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giggling , fragrant with marijuana ; several middling-to-prominent abstract expressionist painters ; an editor of the Hudson Review ; a famous playwright ; a Broadway director whose wife , Mason had earlier breathed into my ear , was an incurable nymphomaniac ; three rather hairy young literary critics from N.Y.U. , who stood by the buffet and soberly stoked themselves with turkey ; an art critic ; a critic of jazz ; a drama critic ; half a dozen sleepy-looking jazz musicians ; and a shoal of young and pretty models who zigzagged swishing about the room ,  |p143or  postured in corners , highball glasses clamped before their noses like smelling salts . A bright , frenetic sound of jazz boomed from some concealed source , buoying it all up : whenever the music paused , with a scratchy flutter , the young models seemed to pout ever so perceptibly , and they sagged in their chic spring dresses like wilting bouquets . " That Mason , " a hoarse voice spoke at my side , " now there 's a boy for you . " This proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like myself was either illat-easeor neglected , and had dropped anchor in my alcove . He said he was " with Republic , " which I assumed was a steel company until he explained to me with strangled guffaws that he was connected with the movies . " No , my boy . I only been to Pittsburgh once in my life . " Then he repeated : " That Mason . Now there 's a boy for you . A genius . Figure everything he 's got . The eyes . The nose . The expression . Everything . It 's uncanny , I tell you . Just like his dad . " He paused . " Taller , maybe . " " Did you know Mr. Flagg ? " I asked . " Did I know Justin Flagg ? My boy , I suckled him . I was a mother to him . Hah ! " He drew back his lips in a grin , revealing a row of mottled incisors . " It 's the Jew in me , " he said with a nudge . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fidget and looked around , and at this moment there passed by us one of the loveliest girls I had ever seen . She was a stunning girl with soft coppery hair : finely spun whorls of it made a fringe of halos around her head . And she had an inward warmth and gentleness that seemed to radiate from her as she moved . " Hello , Marty , having a good time ? " she said to Garfinkel , briefly clutching his hand ; it was definitely not a show-business voice , beingdevoid of flimflam and coming from some place other than her sinuses , her throat , to be exact , and with a warm and womanly intonation . Best of all , she did n't call him " darling . " " Hi , Celia , " said Garfinkel , as she moved off among the crowd , " where have you been , darling ? " " Who is that  --  " I started to say to Garfinkel , but again he was talking about Mason . " I see , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Years . The boy 's a genius . Just like his dad . Only he 's going to be a genius in the field of playwrighting . " He was a nice little man , Garfinkel , with a look of stoical lonesomeness . For some reason , I saw him doing the mambo on countless Grace Line cruises to Brazil , with women forever taller than himself.  | " You 've read his play ? " I asked . " No , " said Garfinkel , " but he 's told me about it . It ca n't miss , I tell you . It 's a natural . The boy 's a genius . " " I see . " " I mean , think of the advantages he 's had , being born the son of Justin Flagg . " His eyes grew dreamy and remote . " Flagg . That 's a name with which to conjure  --  " And he looked up at me significantly . " In certain circles , that is . " There are these women , whose special beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve of the most unadventurous of men . Celia was one . She fascinated me , and now , as she stood in the center of the noisy room , I was determined to meet her . I coughed and began to drift away from Garfinkel , who was saying : " Levitt . Are you a member of the Long Island and Levittown , P.A. , housing firm Levitts ? " There must be something basically unsound about the structure of my name ; I said I was , and let it go at that , and moved out toward Celia . But as I worked my way across the , room in her direction I found myself in a cross-current of bodies and was soon marooned near the buffet table , where I fell into shallow talk with the Hudson Review fellow , who did not exactly wince when I mentioned the college I had gone to but made an owlish adjustmentwith his eyes as if suddenly he were able to see right through my head . I think it must have been then that I decided to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one corner of the room where , as around some bright blossom , several young men had gathered murmuring like bees . She was lovely , but she would never be mine and now , besides , the Hudson man , who had been talking about middle-brow culture , was as tired of me as I was of him . Yawning almost in unison , we bade each other a relieved good night , and I went to tell Mason I was leaving . Now , was it some exhibitionistic streak in Mason ( part of that whole hysteric craze for sex , that incessant hee-haw and jabber about the carnal side of love which was like a hot breath blowing down the neck when you listened to him , which is fine at fifteen or sixteen , but which in a man you expect to become muted  --  not less hysteric , just muted ) that kept him from locking the bedroom door ? He knew that I was aware where he was ; indeed , he had said that he would be expecting me . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would think he might doubleboltit when settling down to doing what I was luckless enough to surprise him at . But this was Mason , alas , not you or me , and I can not pretend to know what he was always up to . Ip145do know I got the shock of my life when my knock went unansweredand , opening the door , I saw the two of them in the blazing light , Mason and Carole , naked as pullets and frenziedlyabed , locked in that entangled embrace all pink flesh and pounding posteriors and arms which I wish I could say fulfilled the fantasist , the Peeping Tom in me , but which instead , in terms of sex or aesthetics or anything you can name , had the effect of a huge shot of novocaine . It seemed somehow so obviously staged that I stood there and watched for a moment with the fascinationof one who is witnessing his first autopsy and then , recoveringmy wits , uttered an inane " Good night , Mason , " slammed the door like a startled hotel maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marveling at the terrible potency of conjugal love which could cause a man to take his wife to bed , drunk as she was , in the midst of his own party . The point being , of course , that Carole was not his wife at all . ( Could I be blamed if , short years removed from Virginia , I assumed that when a man said " love of my life " he meant his wife ? Probably . ) Because as I started to leave the place , Garfinkel was near the door , and with him was my impossible vision of the evening , the fair and glowing Celia . " Levitt , " said Garfinkel . " You are n't leaving , are you ? I 'd like you to meet Mason 's wife . Celia , this is Peter Levitt . " " Oh , you must be Peter Leverets ! " she said with a smile , all warmth and animation . " Mason 's told me so much about you and those wonderful years you had together in Virginia . That crazy school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were here ! " " Leverett , then . Sorry , my boy , " said Garfinkel . " Anyway , I want you to know that right here , right in this little doll here , residesa great deal of credit for Mason 's genius . " Mason 's wife ? Too many emotions crowded in at once ( Carole , " the love of my life , " life : wife , what an idiot ! ) ; I looked at Celia and found I could not speak . She was a flute-sound , a bell , a reed ; Carole was a moo . And at that very moment Mason and Carole . . . I have rarely felt such squirmy distress , such disenchantment with anything , or everything . " Art is dead , Peter , " Mason said to me at one point or another during that week in New York . " Well , if not dead yet , then put it this way  --  the dear old Muse is slowly dying , and in a couple more decades we 'll watch her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's as plain as the nose on your face . Couple science with a general leveling of taste everywhere , and the demise is inevitable . But there 's no need to weep , you know . You ca n't weep over the determinism of history . Facts are facts . By the end of the century art  --  painting , music , poetry , drama  --  all of them , they 'll be as dead as the labyrinthodont . " " What 's that ? " " A prehistoric amphibian , late Permian period . " " Well then , tell me , Mason , why do you keep on with this play you 're doing ? " " Oh I do n't know , " he said , " a sort of diehardism , I suppose . A sailor with any sort of guts does n't abandon ship even when the rails are awash . Besides , there 's always the faint possibility  --  I mean a really faint one , but a possibility  --  that history will give a lurch , as history sometimes does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a couple of things already that make me think that might happen . " " Like what ? " " Well , in painting , abstract expressionism . And in music , jazz . There 's a tremendous freedom and vitality in both of them , a fantasticthrowing-off of restraint and the dreadful constipating formalismand all the traditional crap that 's been such a hindrance to t art . So  --  well , I 'll admit it 's a dim hope , but if these two ever get really going , we might have that renaissance and of course , as historyhas shown , all the rest of the arts will start booming , too . Do you see what I mean ? " " Well , I know nothing about painting , Mason , " I said . " But as for music , I think some of that early Dixieland is quite marvelous , and Bessie Smith , but after all  --  " " After all , what ? " Since I like to express myself exactly , I grope , lose time and ground , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he put in , " there is always J. S. Bach . Is n't that what you were going to say ? " " More or less , Mason , " I replied . " Though somewhat more elaborately . " " De gustibus , Peter , " he said amiably . " I 'll let you keep yourcorpse if you let me keep my sexy dollbaby , all alive and singing . " t " De gustibus , Mason , " I said . " Once a square always a square . But everybody has to have a complement . I think it 's because you 're so square that I love you . " And things like this he would say with such a sweet smile , withp147such true and honest affection , that there would dissipate as if into the air about him all that , seconds before , I had considered offensive , pretentious , and banal . We had several weighty discussions that week , about art and relatedmatters . Though college may have rejected him  --  or he it  --  he seemed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it , and he wore his really rather amazing erudition flashily and blatantly , like a man outfitted for a costume ball . If it would please you to know the antique origins of Rosicrucianism ; the existenceof the Kuria Muria Islands , guano atolls off the coast of Aden ; the difference between absolute and apparent magnitudes in the measurement of stars ; the origin of female circumcision among the tribes of the Kalahari ; of the influence of Ranulf de Glanvill upon law ( " You mean you studied law , Peter , and never heard of Glanvill ? " ) ; of the high tolerance of sexual perversion , and the modes employed , among the Huron Indians ; the differencebetween fibromyoma and chondroma in the classification of benign tumors ; the reasons for German scholarship assigning undueinfluence of Thomas Kyd upon Shakespeare ; the Roman use of the mechanical dildo  --  Mason could fill you in about all these matters , richly and eloquently , these and a thousand more . Most curiously , too  --  perhaps though only because , a child of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost never bored me with his knowledge ; he made fanciful play with these useless items , setting them loose in the midst of some joke or story in the way that a magician brings forth from his sleeve rabbits , roses , startling doves . Once more would arise his Yugoslavian experience , which he never tired of telling and which I never minded hearing , if only becausenew insights , new characters kept intruding  --  the jovial mayor of the town , an Italian deserter ( the victim of epilepsy , and given to murderous rampages through the night ) , the S.S. commandantwho had paid a frightening visit to the villa one day  --  and from this substructure now arose the most dazzling edifice of fact , history , lore , and legend . " Of course old Plaja was really a full-blooded Dalmatian , " he would tell me . " Which is to say that he had a warrior 's heart . You see , his ancestors had all fought against the Venetians in the Middle Ages when a real scoundrel of a king they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundredthousand ducats , I think it was . A fantastic gory period ! Let me tell you . . . " And off he would go . And somehow , during the telling , I would learn that the chief enemy of the common orchard plum is the curculio , a repulsive small beetle ; that the codpiece wasp148proscribed by Pope Sixtus V as a universal threat to chastity ; and that the word " falcon " derives from the Latin falx , meaning sickle and describing the bird 's curved talons . A striking fact about Masonis that , despising the past as he did , he yet knew so much about it . Now , in my smudged and tear-stained book of memories there are still mounted two photographs . In the first of these ( I am trying to remember at what party it was taken ) my own white hand is visible , fishbelly-pale in the glare of the flashbulb . Carole is there , too , looking quite dazed and voluptuous , her lips moistly reflecting the light as she bends down her face to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a second later , a kiss on the back of his well-barbered head . What is it that disturbs me so about this picture  --  and in a way that has nothing to do with what Mason or Carole were doing at all ? It is Mason himself who dominates the picture . In profile , he is talking to an invisible someone ; he is unaware of the lips , the wet bud of a tongue hovering at the nape of his neck , and at that moment , poised in that split instant of time before the mouth descends , his face wears an expression of total dejection . It is an odd look , one Mason rarely wore  --  of heaviness , of weariness , and disgust with life ( who could he be talking to ? it does not matter )  --  and I have pondered that picture many times , always touched a bit by this fleeting sorrow of his , which I so seldomsaw in life . Was he as unhappy during that time as this picture tells me he was ? Right now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sadness in this other picture of Mason . Here we are on his Village rooftop  --  there I am again , and there is Mason , and not Carole this time , but Celia . It is noontime of a spring day ; this you can tell from the light , and from the blooming flowerboxes and trees on the penthouse roofs of the buildings behind , and by the cool spring dress Celia is wearing . As from all fading snapshots , longing and nostalgia emanate from this one : they are in the amateurish tilt of the picture and its yellowing hue and in the sense of springs gone forever , old shoe styles and hair-dos , rooftops that no longer exist ( Mason 's house was torn down not long ago ) , in that knowledge which is perhaps the camera 's single most poignant gift , of time past and irretrievable . Celia , appearing in retrospect now even more lovely than I remember her in the flesh , has her face and eyes upturned toward Mason , very close to his own , seeming ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her perfect white teeth . Mason inclines his head down toward her ; he is ready to bite her back , but most playfully and joyfully , and hisp149face is suffused with exuberance , with merriment and happiness . As for myself , I am standing somewhat aside , contemplating whoeverit was that snapped the picture , and my expression can best be described as glum . And behind us all a flock of pigeons , slatecoloredblurs , rove heavenward above the water towers , lending to the whole moment of bygone time a feeling of feathery movement , of space and life . . . . I must say that Mason really took over my hours , night and day , during that brief period . I had quit my job preparatory to going to Europe and , having nothing to do , I found it was fun to tag along with Mason ; he never ran out of steam , there was always somethingnew to do , somewhere new to go , and he always picked up the check . I protested this ( I really did ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own secret humiliation . " Look , dollbaby , " he would say , " those French girls you 're going to have soon do n't come cheap . Save your money . " And then he would pause . " May I be frank about something ? " he would continue . " I 'm a rich boy and I know it , and I like to spend dough on people I love . Good God , let 's do n't let Justin 's ill-gotten loot go to waste . Now give me back that tab ! " Then , pulling out his wallet , he would say : " In a crummy democracy you have to go through the damndest contortions if you 're rich , pretending you have n't got a nickel to your name . " I relented , with a sort of hoarse catch in my voice . It was a cozy situation to find oneself in  --  for a short term , anyway . More than once I wondered whether  --  if I had not already planned to go abroad  --  it might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of my days , and the thought gave me a shiver . Because if I suspected that there was lust for a kind of ownership in these big gestures of Mason 's , I also realized with some shame that my willingness to be owned was stronger than I ever wanted to admit . But who could blame me ? Each night ( and there were at least five of them ) brought me a different girl . And they were all brainless , beautiful , and willing . What a treat to be in the hands of such a casual , big-hearted procurer ! I mean it . I have never had so much consecutive sex , and of such variety , in all my life . And I was indebted to Mason for it . I had become the crown prince among his freeloaders . And I knew I was in when he showed me his collection of erotica . When I first saw the collection , I could manage only a long , deep-felt whistle . " Where 'd you get all this stuff , Mason ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years ago . Itp150was his bequest to me . Let me give you some more ice there . He gave me the core of the collection , that is , " he went on , " most of those books over to the right there . I got interested and added the rest a little bit at a time . What it adds up to , really , is an investment . You know there 's a big market for good stuff like this . It 's almost as solid as the art market and a hell of a lot more stable than gold or stamps . " The " core , " I discovered , was made up of such grizzled entries as The Thousand Nights and a Night ( London , privately printed , 1921 ) ; The Memoirs of Fanny Hill ( ditto , 1890 ) ; the complete works both in French and English of that " really incomparable genius , in his own way , " as Mason described him , the " divine " Marquis de Sade , including his masterpiece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Les Crimes de rumour ( Paris , end plates , illustrated , 1902 ) ; Apollinaire 's Les Onze mille verges ; and half a dozen volumes , in English , of the Paris-printed bonbons for undernourished Anglo-Saxons . But after I finished thumbing through these elementary items there came a tidal wave of delights such as I had never dreamed existed : beautifully embellishedworks in Italian and French , some dating from the seventeenth century ; Priapean celebrations of Roman fashions in love , circa A.D. 79 , as revealed by the friezes of Pompeii ; delicate and ingenious drawings from Arabia , from India , from Java and Japan , on rice paper and scrolls ; love among the Cubans and the Turkestani and the Persians ; love even among the Scandinavians , where in a series of photographs a handsome and vigorous blond quartet from Stockholm , slippery-looking as herrings , fornicated amid an aura of gingerbread bedsteads , smorgasbord and snaps . One Chinese entry  --  a kind of apotheosis of depravity , if Mason was to be believed  --  formed an exquisite round-robin of contortionistperversions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down was made of human skin . Into this lascivious concourse I plunged giddily , and since hot erotica , like catnip , is meant to arouse , it did just that to me . At least , for a while . Throbbing , I examined the act of love as performed conventionally in New Orleans brothels , in echelon among the Monegasques , even octagonally  --  in an album of snapshots more chaotic than titillating  --  among a bedroom full of disheveled Greeks . A pair of Algerian priests made love to a skinny , spiritless nun , and the nun to the Mother Superior ; a small volume of oddly fatalistic lithograph cartoons , done in England long before Waterloo , showed Bonaparte him- 4 self , massively virile , astride a series of squirming mistressesp151labeled Italia , Germania , and Alas , Britannia ! The zoological section , featuring humans with brutes , or vice versa , I found less to my taste , as I did the huge and synoptic German Lexikon of sex which , explicit though it was in its illustrations , leaned grimly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sexual infraction . In fact , of the arts of mankind , this entire mode of expression has , to all except perhaps the pubescent and the unbalanced , the least staying power of all , so that it was not long before I was betrayed by a certain repetitivenessin what I had seen , and , numb  --  really numb  --  I turned to look at Mason , feeling terribly blue about the whole enterprise . " You mean this junk is really worth a lot of money ? " I said . " You 're damn right it is . That Chinese scroll alone I paid five hundred dollars for . Early Ch'ing dynasty . Here 's an interesting item . " It was a large photograph , some decades old , of a strapping , grinning , coal-black African in mettlesome coition with an ostrich . I gazed at it for a long time , bemused . " Sex is the last frontier , " he was saying somewhere behind me . " In art as in life , Peter , sex is the only area left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full freedom . Where men can cast off the constrictions and conventions of society and regain their identity as humans . And I do n't mean any dreary , dry little middle-class grope and spasm , either . I mean the total exploration of sex , as Sade envisioned it , and which makes a librarylike this so important to the psyche , and so rewarding . It 's what you might call le nouveau libertinage . Because , you see , it was Sade 's revolutionary concept , his genius , to see man not as what he is supposed to be  --  an inhumanly noble creature whose nobility is a pseudo-nobility simply because he is hemmed in and made warped and sick in an impossible attempt to free himself of his animal nature  --  but as he is , and forever will be : a thinking biological complex which , whether rightly or wrongly , exists in a world of frustrating sexual fantasy , the bottling-up of which is the direct cause of at least half of the world 's anguish and misery . It 's a strange paradox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is cruel and causes pain , when in reality he was the original psychoanalyst of the modern age , seeing more evil in the fruitless repression of sex , and more pain , too , than in what to him was the simple answer to that repression , and the panacea  --  release from the fantasy world , and the working out of sex on a functioning , active level . And again that does n't mean somep152tepid little convulsion in the dark . It means group interplay , for one thing  --  and there 's no one alive who has n't yearned at one time or another for community sex  --  and the free airing of bisexualimpulses , among other things , and the final orgiastic purgationwhich has been a cleansing aspect of the human experience , at least among those humans who have been bold enough to break convention , since the dawn of recorded history . And it 's going to be the future major crisis in art . Because only when the sexual act is able to be portrayed in art  --  in prose and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that 's a problem )  --  then and only then will we have any kind of freedom . Because for one thing  --  " Brooding over the outlandish picture , I had become wildly tickled in a helpless in-dwelling fashion , and I felt chuckles of laughter rising up in me and I turned around and let out a loud yuck , finally , which caused Mason to halt in mid-sentence , eyes level upon me . " What 's so funny ? " he said in an irritated voice . And as he spoke , the words he had been saying , so solemnly and with such passion , registered upon my mind belatedly , abruptly , as if a door had been thrown briskly open to let it all shamble in . " Oh I do n't know , Mason , 've always thought sex was a lot of fun  --  wonderful , great , fabulous . The best thing on earth . But you seem to want to turn it into a cult , and a gloomy one at that . " " You reveal yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a touch of irritation remained . " At its greatest , sex has always been a cult . Nurtured and refined like any other high art . " With a thin smile he removed the ostrich picture from my hand . " Squarestof the squares , " he added affably . " A matter of taste , Mason , " I said . But these two photographs  --  the one with Carole , and the one with Celia  --  still haunt me ; they are as mnemonic as a fragrance , a scrap of music , a familiar voice which has not been heard for many years . I turn back to the first one , trying to extract its mood , comprehendit , place it in time  --  then all of a sudden ( perhaps it 's only the memory in turn of the ostrich that does it , or the bedroom full of Swedes ) I know what it is and I know what it means . Like one of those trick effects in the movies where for a long instant the scene becomes motionless  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somersault or a comic prat fall with legs and arms stilled in frozen chaos above the floor  --  then once again rolls on , this pic/ture suddenly achieves movement ; indeed now , with very little effortof the imagination I am able to persuade myself that I am no longer viewing the scene , but am within it as I was so long ago , that my hand moves back just a bit , fidgeting , as , still half-blinded by the flashbulb , I watch Carole 's protuberant bulb of a tongue reach Mason 's neck and linger there , wet and fluttering , while at the same moment her well-fleshed paw steals forth to unzip his fly . Shades of the divine Marquis ! Flow , after Mason 's dilations upon " group interplay " several nights before , it never occurred to me , until it was almost too late , that he had brought me to an orgy , mystified me then as it mystifies me now ; I can only say in all honestythat I must have known , or suspected , that it was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgiastic purgation , too . Our host that evening , in a large , flossy apartment near WashingtonSquare , was a famous young playwright called Harvey Glansner . Immediately after the war he achieved an astonishing success on Broadway with a play that with great courage , insight , and pity had laid bare , in terms of a lower-class New York family , the neurotic agony of our time . Then he had had several failures in a row , which in America , especially on Broadway , is the equivalentof the grave . Thereafter , to the distress of many who still saw in him the hope of American drama , his talent had gone to pieces ; he took to writing a knotty kind of prose  --  articles mainly for the small quarterlies  --  in which he hymned and extolled the then burgeoning signs of juvenile delinquency , psychopaths , rapists , pimps , dope addicts and other maladjusted wretches until , finally descending into a sort of semicoherent pornography , he became unreadable ( though not , as I expect he wished to be , unpublishable ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sort of wicked stir , no matter how puerile . He wrote much about the solemnity of the orgasm , its lack and its pain , and its relationship to God . With all of this , he was a gifted writer , even after his fall from Broadway grace , and he might have found more general favor except for the fact that all of his essays gave to sex a reference of horror , discomfort and disgust : you may sentimentalize sex by confusing it with love , and still be read , but if you equate sex with unpleasurableness , you may expect your audience to be obscure , whether your bias is puritan or pornographic . " Like Dante , Harvey 's a real hater , " Mason said , adding that he was writing a biography called Karl Marx : Giant in Orgasm . I think it was from this Glansner that Mason drew his erotic inspiration . A pimply-faced , cadaverous young man , with a potp154belly , beaked nose , and horn-rims , Glansner greeted us at the door with a meaningful ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed out the marijuana . I should describe the cast , which for an orgy I suppose was a meager one , though maybe not . There were eight of us  --  the forever-present Pennypackers , foxy as ever ; Glansner and his wife , a sinuous golden-haired beauty with harlequinglasses , whose name I forget ; and , as a kind of anchor man , myself , accompanied by a girl named Lila  --  whom Mason had dug up for me  --  a ripe and amiable stripper who from the beginningseemed far more knowing and dubious about the setup than I , drawing me aside early ( it was not hard to do , for the sound of jazz was deafening and blue lightbulbs everywhere cast on each distant face a bruised , mortuary gloom ) and saying , to my puzzlement : " Do n't let on now , baby , but I think I smell a fish . " Now then , like many hectic recollections this one comes back to me in bits and flickers  --  blue lights , howling saxophones and the bittersweet odor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snapping pictures with a huge Graflex . I think it was then that Carole went through the routine with Mason 's fly , only to be chided by him for her crudeness . Eschewing the weed , which seemed to have almost no effect on me , I stuck to a little red wine , and for most of the time sat hip to hip with Lila on a large white leather ottoman . Jazz , the music not of fusion but of fission , was a constant explosion in my face , and when it ceased , to allow the record-changer to softly whir and plip-plop , the silence was eerie and burdensome , and I recall wonderingat the tone of this gathering , which from the outset had the mingled features of despair , hostility , and the deplorable inertia of a meeting of southern Baptist young people . I have since learned that marijuana stills the desire for speech ; it certainly laid a heavy hand on conversation that night . Only Lila and I , islanded on our ottoman , tried to talk ; as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were puffing from cupped palms , wreathed in bluish fumes . After a time , however , came a slight stir of activity ; there was now considerable faint , high , hollow giggling and our host arose to put some dance music on the phonograph : it had a soft bourgeois sound after all the jazz , but it must have been part of the ritual , because for one thing it allowed Mason to get up and with a tight tense look on his face to take Glansner 's beautiful wife in his arms and conduct her around the dim room in the semblance of a dance , rather falteringly , and with a great deal of unabashed and mutual hanky-panky in the lower regions.  |p155I  wish I could go into more generous detail about this orgy , but at just about this point the whole affair  --  for me , anyway , and for Lila  --  began to terminate . Outside of Mason 's pelvic work the only overt sexual act I stayed long enough to witness was between the Pennypackers , who climbed atop each other on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic copulatory motions which , since they were married , brought from the others lazy , tolerant sniggers of laughter , as one might laugh at children who know the rudiments but nothing of the spirit of the game , and are also a bit touchingly anxious . A little later , while Mason danced , Glansner was nuzzling Carole in the shadows , muttering to her in a strange you-all , cotton-picking dialect ( a few years later this became known as hip talk , but I did not know it at the time ) ; the words he crooned drowsily were the gamiest in the language , and there was a compulsive , metronomic desolation in the way he said them that chilled me to the marrow , but if he calculated them to excite , and if my Lila was any barometer , he had made a serious miscalculation . Lila was a big healthy girl with a fine elastic bosom ; she had been around , and there was no nonsense about her . When I turned to her  --  more than smelling that fish now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking pot when I was sixteen years old . Somebodyought to tell that poor square to grow up and stop diddling himself . Does he think he 's giving her kicks ? Look out , honey , here comes trouble . " The Pennypackers , down off their couch , were slithering toward us ; we rose in unison , Lila and I , self-protectively , and danced off through the gloom , hugging the walls . " When I was performing in London , " she said , " they called a deal like this a nahsty . Which is just about exactly the word for it . Mason should have better sense . I 'm a good party girl , but this is strictly not my cup of tea . What does he think I am , anyway , some sort of tart ? " And then she pressed close . " Let 's get out of here , baby , and have something good and private . " We danced for quite some time , close together , monogamously welded . There was a lot of stirring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go I turned to see Mason , standing fully illuminated in the doorway to the bedroom , his arm around a glassy-eyed and now unbodiced Mrs. Glansner , the two figures obscuring all except the face of Glansner himself , propped against the headboard of an enormous bed , and wearing ( to my surprise , for I had expected something more mellow ) the impotent , sepulchral look of a man separated by five minutes from the gallows.  |p156As  for Mason 's own expression : I think I must have anticipated the smoldering lust that one reads about in romantic novels , but all that was there  --  or so it seemed to me  --  was a kind of miserableand forsaken innocence . " What 's the matter , Petesy ? " he said . " You are n't leaving , are you ? " If there was not what one might call anguish in his voice , there was a sudden broken sense of loneliness , of abandonment , and as he said these words again , his voice rising  --  " You are n't leaving , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my defection . " Come on now , dollbaby , " he said cajolingly , though the hurt was still there , " you 're not going to chicken out , really . " " Lila 's not feeling well , Mason , " I lied . I do not want to say which of us , Mason or I , was right or wrong ; the question , if there is a question , is not a matter of either . But at the moment , aflame though I was with desire for Lila , I felt that it was exceedingly thick of Mason to fail to understand why I might not wish to take down my trousers and in harsh light , sweatingcheek by jowl with the whole crowd  --  their eyes on me and mine on them  --  despairingly perform the joyous rites of love . " O.K. , Peter , " Mason said . " Back to Squaresville . " Next morning , breakfasting with Lila after a full night , I think we discerned the most fitting irony of all when it occurred to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glansner Carole , the Pennypackers  --  like an abbreviated Paolo and Francesca  --  hadmost probably had only each other . But then Lila grew sad . " Gee , " she said . " What do you suppose is eating Mason ? With that wife of his  --  you know her ?  --  a real doll . I think he must be flipping his lid , if you want to know the honest to God 's truth . " There are gestures that linger in the mind . One bright day as Masonand Celia and I were driving to Long Island for lunch , Celia 's hand went up to the back of his head . " Look at his hair , " she said . " Look how it shines in the sunlight . Is n't it just beautiful , Peter ? " I can not help but remark upon this characteristic that Celia shared with Wendy : the most outrageous flattery of their darling boy . But here the resemblance ends . Celia was something apart and by herself . If Carole remains in my memory a large nocturnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daytime creature who had no part at all in Mason 's night-crawling . Indeed , so separate were Mason 's eve/nings and days , his life with Carole and his life with Celia , that except for one or two instances I can not remember Celia except in daylight , as in that photograph , her face upturned toward Mason 's , as toward the sun . How she adored him ! And with what innerrestlessness I watched the casual fashion in which he accepted her adoration , her tenderness , her flattery . Not just because I had fallen for her myself , in a distant hopeless way , but because like Lila I could not understand how he could reject this haute cuisine in favor of Carole 's slumgullion . Yet to give Mason credit , he was courteous and even gentle with Celia  --  at least when I was around ; in conspiracy with the sunlight she seemed to be able to alter his character , subdue him , tenderize him . She was as soft as silk ; she had a kitteny way about her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her splendid voice there were all sorts of warm , delectable modulations , all of them sexy , and all of them fine . She had dignity , too , and that kind of radiant poise , so rare in beautiful women , which comes from the consciousness that one 's beauty is meant to please men , and not oneself . I suspect that the single thing she lacked was the small streak of bitchiness that even the most angelic of women can muster , given the provocation : there are some men who despise a good woman even more than a virago , and I would be inclined to guess that it was Celia 's decency , generosity , and goodness that drove Mason into Carole 's swollen embrace , were it not for the fact that Mason would always find his Carole , no matter what . Anyway , we had a fine time , the three of us , during the last four or five days before I sailed to Europe . I had to some extent moved in on Mason , using my apartment only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had lunch with them , and with the two of them I spent long and lazy afternoons . A rather sedate and platonic menage a trois it was , come to think of it ; we felt very close , warm , familial . Mason curbed his tongue when around Celia , I noticed ; the nagging , compulsive smuttiness in his talk was gone , as was all the leering cabala about le nouveau libertinage , and every now and then , when he would tell an amusing story , and as I stole a glance at Celia and watched her gay charming face crinkle up in delicious merriment , with the innocent and wonderstruckdelight of a child who has seen some strange new animal , some clown , some fresh marvel , I had a difficult time envisioning her as a helpmate sharing Mason 's interest in pyramidal arrangements of naked Turks , or having anything to do with Glansner 's stews . Though naturally I need not have concerned myself on thisp158account because , as I have said , Mason kept his nights and days distinctly apart : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when , later , I joined Mason , it would be in some smoky Village pad thronged with people who , it seemed to me , were always in a state of desperate lethargy and hunched-up near-collapse ( though , " Peter , these cats are crazy , " Mason told me once . " Kicks and excitement are all they want , they 're the last rebels left . " ) and where there was always Carole , slow and sleepylidded , asking for another Scotch . " What are they rebelling against ? " I asked . " Against the H-bomb . A world they never made . " " But , Mason , look here . If they just seemed to be having any fun , I 'd  --  " " Fun ? " he said . " They 're too desperate for fun . They understand the legacy that 's been left us . " I let it go at that . Indeed , the more I saw of Mason in this dual role of daytime squire and nighttime nihilist , the more I saw working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent to me that here was a truly distinctive young American  --  able in a time of hideous surfeit , and Togetherness ' lurid mist , to revolt from conventionalvalues , to plunge into a chic vortex of sensation , dope , and fabricated sin , though all the while retaining a strong grip on his two million dollars . At the time it seemed to me not entirely unadmirable : at least it took more flair , more imagination than most rich boys have , or use . The day before I left for Europe has a recollected purity that some rare summer skies have  --  hazeless , cloudless , with a flagrantimmensity of blue that , at least for a moment , allays all the painful mistakes of the past and promises rewarding things to come . Never before or since has New York had such a magnanimousday , and as we drove out to Long Island even the dismal boulevards of Queens seemed odorous with spring . But it was not only the weather that made it so fine . It was Celia , fragile and mild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing like a candle . It was in the sports car , a Ferrari which Mason  --  always in the vanguard  --  had bought only the day before ; such machines still attracted curiosity then , and as we drew up at stoplights ( Masonand Celia in front , myself crouched behind , in a kind of nest of jacks and wrenches , much as I had been years before when I sat curled up in the luggage behind Mason and Wendy ) we were the cynosure of Forest Hills . But more than anything , almost , itp159was in Mason ; he was in command of the day : as we zoomed toward the far green reaches of the island he talked his head off , and with a sorcerer 's charm . Jokes tumbled from his lips , and witty wicked allusions , and airy ballooning puns ; his spoofery was a marvel , so wild and preposterous that Celia , rosy with laughter , had to implore him to stop , put her head down in his lap and cried , " Stop ! Stop it ! " while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the psychologist , the solemn apostle of the groin  --  he was no longer any of these . He seemed three times as alive as any other mortal could hope to be , brimful with warmth and wit , playing to the hilt that role which God alone knows why he did not work at harder , so much pleasure did it give to the people around him . Suddenly , as if aware of this gift to the two of us , and perhaps aware also of the source behind it , he wrapped his arm around Celia and held her close against him , purring gratefully  --  which gave me a spasm of envious pain . Later , after a fine lunch with wine at a North Shore restaurant we sat far into the afternoon on a terrace splashed with dappled , leafy sunlight . Riders on horseback cantered past us ; somehow again I thought of Wendy . Thoughtful , contented , stripped of the nighttime 's high frenzy , and holding Celia 's hand in his own , Masontold me what to expect in Europe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't . " You wo n't find it all pleasant , Peter , it 's still recoveringfrom the war . And there 's a dead , dead feeling everywhere . Art really has come to a finish over there , and that 's why  --  though I love to travel  --  I could never live anywhere for very long , except in America . I do n't mean to sound platitudinous , but we are the nation of the future and anybody who cares , really , and who casts his lot with Europe  --  permanently , that is  --  is simply missing out , in my opinion . The so-called treasures of the past are all very well  --  a necessary experience , in fact , for anyone who pretends to culture  --  but significant form , as Clive Bell calls it , is dependent upon constant change , constant renewal from the resources of the present , a perpetual shaking-up and reordering , and this it is beyond the powers of Europe ever to do again . Which is why without any embarrassment at all I 'm proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this  --  about his only heavy statement of the day  --  he went on to describe the fine things I would find in Europe ( " If you look at it as a kind of stillenchantedplayground , you wo n't go wrong . " )  --  Paris and the sunny delights of the Midi and the Cote d'Azur , the fantastic beauty of the Alps , the Costa Brava , the Balearics . And I satp160studiously , rapt , listening to this travelogue ; he made magic of the scenes he described , the people he knew ( " Here , I 'll write a little note to Papa Albert . The greatest coquilles St. Jacques in Lyon , which is to say in all the world . A one-legged little fellow . . . " ) , the sanctums and hideaways , the cafes and beaches , the sheltered inlets unbeknownst to any American save himself . . . . He made magic of these , and infused it all again with his own brand of bright hilarity ; Celia would gaze at him with longing , tickled half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lip , repressing laughter . Then out it would come , and all of us would laugh , and as we sat there in the lengthening shade of this gay spring day , with its smell of salt air and its white sails aslant against the distant blue and the nearby graveled spatter and crunching of riders along the paths , I thought how fortunate I was , after all , to know this vivid and inexhaustible young man , and count him as a friend . Rich , gloriously handsome , erudite , witty , gifted , a hero of the war , with a wife over whom the goddesses must grind their teeth in rage  --  what else could a man wish to be ? Could the earth hold more youthful promise ? Beside him that day , suddenly , I felt pitifully small , and I gloomed over all that was so paltry and commonplace in myself  --  that forbade me to see all that I disapproved of in him as a superb Renaissance spilling-over , manly as a stud horse , instead of corruption . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view him somewhat less poetically  --  he was not a hero of the war at all . To be more exact , he was a draft dodger ( the scar on his leg he picked up as the result of a bicycle collision at Princeton during his luckless semester ) , and as for Yugoslavia , he had come no closer to it than an enthusiastic reading of Rebecca West 's Black Lamb , Grey Falcon  --  from which he had acquired enough color and historical minutiae to gull far less credulous souls than myself . How did I know all this ? Celia told me . She told me that same night , during what I suppose you might call a visit to me . It was morning , rather  --  it must have been past three , while I was still packing for my trip , when it happened : a frantic rapping at the door , the door itself flung open without a pause , and there was Celia . It had been raining outside . Her hair was plastered down around her forehead and her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a most stricken look of pain and anguish ; her lips parted as if to speak , then her hand went up to the back of her head , came down again , covered with blood . She said nothing at all . After a moment she stared atp161her red and trembling fingers , once more opened her mouth as if to say a word , and then collapsed in a heap upon the floor . Sweet Celia . I was shocked . I brought her around easily enough , with cold water on the brow and instant coffee , hastily made . As for the wound at the back of her head , there was a lump the size of an egg but the cut itself was small and shallow ; soon the bleeding stopped of its own accord , and she lay back with a soft moan against the pillow , breathing heavily , and with one arm flung across her eyes . " What happened ? " I said . " Oh , my head hurts ! " " What in God 's name happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " A plate ? What kind of plate ? " " A Lowestoft plate . A kind of platter . Oh , my head hurts ! " I gave her a couple of aspirin tablets and now ( for she had begun to tremble violently ) covered her with a blanket , insisting that we call a doctor . But she would have none of this : she would be all right  --  he had , after all , hit her before , and harder than this , much harder . " The bastard , " I said . " The swine . Why did he do it ? Has he hit you often ? " " Oh , I do n't know why he hit me , Peter . " She made a move beneath the blanket , as if to rise ; I gently pushed her down . Now she opened her eyes and I saw how red they were from weeping . " I should n't have come here , Peter , " she said . " I 'm really terribly sorry . But I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , you were close and I just did n't know . . . " Her voice trailed off . " No , he does n't hit me often . " ( A wifely remark , loyal even in extremis , if I ever heard one ; you either hit your wife often , or not at all . ) " I 'm really very sorry , Peter , " she said again . " Do n't be sorry , Celia , " I said . " Do n't be . I just wish I 'd known about it sooner . " Inside I had begun to feel a great helpless stormy torment of outrage : that someone should do violence to this warm , gentle little lark of a girl seemed , at least then , in the midst of my distant infatuation , the foulest of all foul sins . " Where is he now ? " I said bitterly . " Where is the bastard ? I 'll lay him out . " I would have , too , or tried . She had come around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows , sat propped with her legs curled beneath her and with her head pillowed against the wall . In this pose  --  smeared hair , dirty bloodstained fingers , red-rimmed eyes and all  --  she lookedp162both lovely and cruelly hurt , a flower upon which has been impressedthe print of a dirty boot . For an instant I came very close to throwing my arms around her and telling her how madly and completelyI adored her , but I was brought up short by her words , which mingled incredulity and desolation within me in equal parts . " Do n't call him those names , " she said gently . " I love him , Peter . I love him , you see . So you must n't call him things like that . Please do n't . I love him . " " You what ? " " Yes , I do , " she said placidly . " After that ? " " Yes . " " Why , for God sake ? " It was simple , she said . She loved him because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island family was terribly well fixed ) , because he made her laugh , because he had taught her so much . And not the least  --  would you believe it ?  --  because he was so good-looking ! And she would go on loving him , no matter what . " I 'm just mad for him , " she said . There was a preposterous , avid , debutante tone in her voice which for an instant made me want to show her the door . But of course I did nothing like that . I sat listening instead ; for two hours or more I sat listening while she told me of her life with Mason  --  of what it was , and what it had been , and what even now ( a shadow passed across her face , and her fingers went up lightly , though still trembling , to the place where he had struck her ) she hoped that life could be . No , she was not going to whitewash him ; she knew his faults as well as anyone . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslavia business was an example of that , and he had used  --  well , some kind of influence  --  to escape Army service . That scar on his leg ? Oh , it was just some kind of traffic accident . But really , did n't I see ? Did n't I see how all of his wild lying was only a part of that breadth and vastness of his whole personality , part of his vision of life , which was so broad and encompassing that it just had to include exaggeration and stretchings of the truth ? Did n't I see that ? Did n't I see how necessary it was for him to tell these things  --  they were harmless , after all , they could hurt no one but himself  --  if only because they represented left-over energy , expansion of his whole terrific imagination ? Did n't I understand that ? " I 'm trying to , Celia , " I said . And yes  --  well , Carole too . His sex life . No , she would n't pretend that it made her happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , real anguish . Sometimes at night she had gotten into such a lonely and frenzied state that she could barely stand it . And Carole was n't the first . There had been Anya and Nancy and Kathy and  --  oh , she could n't count them all . But would n't it be some kind of poor excuse for a wife who , married to a man of such incredible animal magnetism , such vitality and genius , could n't put up with a thing like that ? Yes , those parties  --  she knew about them , all right . They were disgusting . Childish even , to get right down to it . And those pictures . He 'd made her look at them ( O.K. , it was blind of him to think that that would excite her , when , as anyone should know , dirty pictures do n't excite women  --  very much anyway ) and they 'd done nothing but make her squirm . But after all , he was a man , and a different kind of man , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of ambivalence  --  the good and the bad  --  that is bound to be mixed up in such  --  well , in such a really enormous personality . He was an adventurer in the arts , a discoverer , and he just needed to have this kind of release , that 's all . . . . I asked her how she knew he needed it . I had begun to pace the floor . Despite my passion for her , she was losing ground with me , steadily , each time she opened her mouth . She said he just needed it , that 's all . He had told her he needed it , explained it all very philosophically from the artist 's point of view . And she had understood . And she had complied . It was n't too much of a sacrifice to make , was it ? Because otherwise he was so good to her . Oh , if I only knew how much he had taught her . And the places he 'd taken her , and the books he 'd made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't all a bed of roses . What marriage ever was , really ? Most of his friends bored her , especially the Village crowd , who were just a bunch of grownupbabies , actually . And as for the rest  --  well , he had no real friends , she knew that . They were all dreadful spongers , mostly . Mason knew that , he 'd told her sadly that a rich person has no real friend but himself . . . And  --  well , yes , their tastes were n't exactly the same . And he was difficult about it sometimes . Music . Ever since she was a child she had loved music . Brahms . Chopin . Wagner . Especially Brahms . How she loved that wondrous sad finale of the C-Minor Symphony , and the Academic Festival . They reminded her of far-off , dark , sweet , autumnal things  --  twilight and woods with falling leaves and mountain lakes covered with evening mists . Brahms . He must have been a man who knew how to grow old ,  |p164who  welcomed growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , no , sometimes she found it hard to take . He never let her play those kinds of records  --  oh , every now and then , yes . But never it seemed when she was in the mood . And she remembered one time when she longed to hear Brahms so that she took a taxi all the way to Thirty-fourth Street and sat smothered up in a recordstorebooth for a whole summer afternoon , listening and listening . . . . No , sometimes things like that were hard to take . She would admit that . But did n't I see how a wife had to defer to her husband in such matters ? After all , it was the husband who was the  --  well , if you want to call it that , the guide . It was his career , not hers , that really mattered . And if he was so dedicated and devoted to his work ( and it was going to be such a wonderful play , full of swagger and wit ; no , she had n't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslavian scene , the young American officer , the lovely Dalmatian girl ) , if he was so dedicated , then nothing mattered really , even if one wanted babies . . . She stopped talking . Outside , the weather had cleared again . Dawn was draining silverdown the air shaft , and across the way the old men were setting up a noisy commotion in the plumbing . Along the avenues , far off , buses began to growl , and when I turned from the window I saw that Celia 's head was bent down , exposing the raw and sorry wound , and that she was weeping now , silently and hopelessly . I sat down beside her and took her in my arms and for a long time we remained there , amid the debris of departure , saying nothing . When finally she raised her head , she said in a low voice , so faint that I could barely hear it : " Once when we were first marriedwe had a house upstate , in the country . It was really a nice place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , Mason was somehow  --  different then . I mean , he believed in , well , simpler things . We were going to live there and we were going to have children , and he was going to write his plays . I 'll never forget when we moved in and that first night , when we stayed up until dawn . It was fall and it was cold  --  but that dawn , I remember how clear and beautiful it was outside . I remember how Mason went out to burn some trash and how I rood there beside him all bundled up , watching him , watching the quiet countryside getting light , and the cold with a sort of wonderful promise in it , and Masonstanding there by the fire with the wind whipping his hair and the fire blazing up in the dawn . And then he put his arms around  |p165thinking  how happy I would be there in the country with him , having children and helping him while he wrote his plays . What more could a girl ask for ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't ever hit me then . " Once more she was silent , but now I felt a tremor run through her body . " He scares me when he hits me like that . " Her lips were trembling and I held her very close against my side , as I would a little girl . " But that 's all right , " she blurted out suddenly . " I 'm mad for him , just positively mad for him ! " Now she had begun to shake and twitch violently , all over , and she pulled away from me and gazed straight into my eyes . " He can do anything to me , " she said , her voice rising , " anything at all ! I 'm just mad for him ! " And I too pulled away , for it seemed to me she was telling me something that lay deeper than her words . Can one detect in the eye  --  like a mote of dust or a beam of light  --  the peculiar glint of madness ? I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she used over and over , like an incantation . But now as she slid with incredible speed into hysteria , I did know that whatever Mason was doing to her , hitting her with plates was not necessarily his worst oppression . " He has n't made love to me in two years ! " she cried . " But it 's all right ! Because babies ! His career , you see ! I mean it 's all right if we do n't have children ! Do n't you see ! I mean as he says , bringinginnocents into this hellish world ! It 's all right ! And for the best ! Anything he does ! I 'm still just mad for him ! " I finally had to take her around the corner to St. Vincent 's Hospital , where they were very sympathetic : they gave her a sedative and put her to bed . She would pull out of it in a while , they said , and they would send her home . But as I left there in the full light of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life  --  she was still babbling . Ask me why , after all this , I came to see Mason in Sambuco , and my answer would be a vague one . But maybe what happened on shipboard that same morning would partly explain it . I was quite without sensation when , four hours later , I entered my economy-sized cabin on the Queen Mary . And for a moment I thought I had gotten the wrong accommodations . Crammed into that tiny space was the most outlandish assortment of delicacies that I had ever seen : not a single bottle but a whole case of champagne , two enormous wicker baskets of fruit , a flat box ofp166candy the size of a paving block , a high stack of books on the floor , a clutch of whiskey bottles neatly done up in a huge red ribbon , and several baskets of nodding flowers which , shoved together for want of space , had already begun to shed their soft fresh petals upon the floor . Other luxuries were heaped up : half a dozen cartons of cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of caviar . As my eyes took in this scene I was aware of the smoke which in rich blue swirls wreathed the room , and of its smell , which had a pungent herby fragrance that only for the briefest moment I could n't define . Then as I took one step forward , trying to penetrate the gloom , my eyes made out two huddled forms squatting on a bunk : a sallow young man , throttled by a turtle-neck sweater , with evasive , foxy eyes , and a Negro boy of twenty or so who wore velvet ballet pants and a purple jersey and who , shifting now sluggishly in the darkness , leaned out toward me into the light of the porthole , which cast a bright oval of sunshine onto his thinly mustachioed , inky-blue , and cataleptic face . It was a den full of vipers , I knew , and I backed out in haste calling for the steward , who came on the run and in emphatic Cockney tones insisted that I had the right cabin . So I eased back in , introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two youths on the bunk , and when I got no response except what sounded like a soft teehee  --  far-off , indistinct , almost ethereal , as if it came from outer space  --  I turned to examine the candy occupying my bunk , and saw by the card it was for me : " For Petesy from his old daddy . " Intently then , with anger and shame , with gathering resentment yet with some left-over feeling , too , of warm , degrading gratefulness , I went among the other gifts : they were all for me , to each one was attached a card  --  " For Petesy "  --  and in my chagrin I burst out into a fit of sneezing , to which the colored boy , in a voice softly modulated and faraway , said : " Gesundheit , man . You 're just gon na have to excuse this here fog . " " Thanks , " I said . There was a long pause before he spoke again . " Great big tall cat brought all that stuff in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Another faint titter came from his companion . " Let 's cut out , Johnson . Let 's do the poop deck . " " Jesus Christ , " I said aloud in disgust . " Naw , " the colored boy giggled . " Not J.C . A big tall cat with a real groovy yellow-headed chick . Said he  --  " Just then Mason , with a be-orchided Carole in his wake , burstp167into my cabin and fell about my shoulders with loud brutal cries of greeting . " Allons-y , Petesy ! " he yelled into my ear . " Pour chercher la twat francaise . I got half a mind to ship on board with you for this cruise and flush out some of that quail on the Rue Bonaparte . What 's the matter , Pierre ? You look rather down in the mouth for a man who 's going to clash head-on with the choicest flesh in Christendom . " He drew back , his fingertips on my shoulders , and surveyed me with a mild , reproachful look . I must have groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sensed my resentment  --  that whole-hearted disapproval of him which had made me stiff as a board at his touch and had kept my eyes averted and downcast . Oddly , though , still burning with anger as I was over what he had done to Celia , I could not bring myself to say a word to him . " Let me tell you , Peter , " he went on , " I 've cased this tub from stem to stern and although about half of them are a bunch of randy-looking Limeys who look like they take it in the elbow , or somewhere , I saw a couple of broads , American girls , who look ready for anything . ' Course , I had a couple of pals in England duringthe war said these British dames are positive cormorants , jazz you till your ears drop off . But I do n't know . Chacun a son goat . " Another giggle floated up from the shadows . " Man , dig that crazy Frenchman . " Mason wheeled about , looking down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleepy smile . " Well , look here now , Petesy , " he said very loudly , grinning . " I thought when I smelled that tea burning I 'd discover a couple of lotus eaters . " He began to laugh at the top of his voice . " Leverett in Bopland ! " Turning to my shipmates he said : " Boys , you 've got a square on board , but he 's a good man . Do n't put him down . Where you off to ? What are you going to do  --  set the Left Bank on fire ? Where the hell 's your beret ? " " Right here , man , " said the colored boy , pulling drowsily from his pocket a floppy Basque headpiece the size of a pie plate , which he set in rakish slant on his brow , all but obscuring his eyes . " Groovy , n'est-ce pas ? " " Look at it , " his companion giggled . " Like , man , it 's the absolutemost . " Mason burst out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , " he cried . " Give my regards to Sidney Bechet.  |p168Come  on , Peter , it smells like swampfire in here . Let 's go up topsideand get some air . In the meantime , boys , keep your fingers out of that caviar . My friend here is Prince Peter of Yugoslavia and he eats hipsters for breakfast . " Clutching my arm with one hand , and a champagne bottle in the other , he propelled me toward the door , where Carole  --  forgotten by me for these past moments  --  now stood with a forlorn , distraught look on her creamy face , and with a pinkish hue around her eyes , as if she had just stopped weeping and was about to begin again . She gave me a wan , apologetic smile and her lips parted on the breath of a greeting . But before I could reply Mason said , " Excuse me a second , Peter , " and moved her briskly aside to the end of the companionway , where I watched him for a moment deep in agitated colloquy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head pressed down close to hers , his arms buttressed against the wall and hemming her in like those of a top sergeant as he chewed out a fractious recruit . Escape was high in my mind ; I felt rotten enough as it was , and with a kind of insane clarity I knew that if I had to participate , this morning , even as a bystander , in one of Mason 's delirious scenes I would surely end up babbling and sobbingmyself . Yet something held me there , and I watched in fascination as his face grew red as an apple , the veins like tiny throbbing pipes rampant at his brow , and as finally , with an outragedtoss of his hair , he bellowed : " Then go , you lousy bitch ! Back the hell to Coney Island . . . or whatever dump  --  " I thought for an instant that now with his hand drawn back he was going to strike her , but he did n't , allowing his palm as if carried forward by the momentum of an arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . " Go ! " I heard him say again . " Go ! " And then Carole simply collapsed . She gazed up at Mason in dismay , with piteous amazement . " Ah please , " I moaned aloud and turned away . " I 'm fed up ! " I heard him say behind me , and again I awaited the sound of his clobbering hand . But when I turned back now , Carole was beating a sinuous , big-hipped retreat down the corridor , keening like a Hindu , sending through the bowels of the ship ponderous , contralto moos of despair which brought heads poppingout from a dozen doors . When these sounds diminished , finally dying out , I turned back to Mason . His brow was propped against the wall , and the single word he uttered  --  over the celebrantnoise of tourists and the distant throbbing of enginesp169seemed laden with a burden of ten thousand years . " Women ! " he said . " Now what 's the matter , Mason ? " I asked impatiently , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said with a grunt . " I do n't know ! " he repeated , looking seriously into my eyes . " I seem to have a run on woman trouble recently . Carole ! The bitch . Oh , she 'll be back . She 'll be back . I 'm not worried about that . Peter , I 'll tell you , women are another race ! They 're like cannibals . Turn your back and they 're ready to eat you alive . " " What happened , Mason ? " Again , it was none of my business but I could n't think of anything else to say . He seemed to me ineffably tiresome . " Come on , " he said , steering me down the companionway , " let 's go topside . Oh nothing . Nothing , really . We 'll be mooning at each other by noontime . She 's got the curse or something and she decided to take it out on me . Yak , yak . Wants me to make her a movie star . Wants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Darryl Zanuck . I do n't know , every time she gets the rag on she gets positively moon-struck . It 's the worst thing about women  --  that really screwed-up plumbing of theirs . A big jumbo sewer flowing through the Garden of Eden . " To this sort of poetry I am the type of person who usually muttersa complaisant " Yeah . " That 's what I said . " Yeah . " And still , for the life of me , I could not bring myself to mention Celia . But , " Really , Peter , " he blurted suddenly . " I 'm sorry as hell . " His voice as we bustled along became worried and solicitous , almostbeseeching . " Really I am . About last night , I mean . You must think I 'd gone absolutely bobo after last night with Celia and all . She came home just a while ago . We made it up all right . Mean trick of hers , making you patch her up like that . On the other hand , I sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was all nerves , that 's all , with the play . And she was yammering about kids . I 'll give her kids some day , but ca n't she understand that the play comes first ? First time I ever laid hands on her ! I do n't know what made me do a thing like that ! " There was a lack of convictionin his voice , as if he realized I knew better . " Anyway , I sure did n't expect to impose on you something like just now . Oh , Peter , women ! Sometimes I think I 'll switch to beavers . Or moose . Or Rotarians . I do n't know . Or maybe go back to Merryoaks and have Wendy rub me down with Baume Ben-Gay. "  |p170But  when , gaining the outside deck , we pushed up toward the bow through a tourist group of Portland Oregonians , he had recovered from his depression and chattered away at me with jolly gusto . It was a balmy day with a hazeless and sapphire sky across which two planes had sketched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingernails . Erect against the blue , the towers of Manhattan rose up in monolithic glitter , and before this backdrop Mason posed me , talking the whole time as he fiddled with his Leica . " What seized you , to go tourist class ? " he said . " I mean for kicks a couple of guys like that are fine , but a week in the same room  --  murder . Oh , Peter ! I can tell you already just who you 're going to share a table with . I saw the list . A chiropodist from Jackson Heights and a hideous old Lesbian with a hearingaid . Why did n't you fly ? " " I 'm trying to save dough , Mason , " I said . " What do you mean you saw the list ? " He snickered and clicked the camera . " I was just kidding , dollbaby . Do n't worry . The trip 's going to be a dream . " For a minute , without speaking , we drank champagne from paper cups at the rail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow , intolerable hardening of my heart toward Mason , not in spite of his generosity but almost because of it , and because now , singled out so uniquely for his grotesque affections , I felt no rare warmth or gratitude but only resentment , a soiled and debased feeling , as if I were the receiver of bribes . Anyway , something  --  my pride , or only an outraged sensibility  --  refused to let me speak , and it was Mason finally , in solemn , even sorrowful tones which surprised me , who broke the silence . " Well , Peter , I 'm going to miss your homely face . Drop me a line every now and then , will you ? I 'm going to miss you , boy . I do n't know why . You 're really outrageously dull and prissy as an old biddy of seventy-two . But you know , I guess , how fond I 've always been of you . Celia put her finger on it , I think . She said , He understands people , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thought by nodding gravely and stroking your whiskers and nonchalantlyscratching your ass at the right time . Anyway , Pierre  --  anyway , I 'm going to miss you . " " What are you going to be doing now , Mason ? " I said idly . He was silent for a moment . It was a peculiar and meaningful silence , one that I had learned to arm myself against . It involved an amount of deep rumination , a sparkle in the eye : and by now I felt I knew him so well that I could almost hear the crafty currentsp171of his brain at work , regimenting those shamelessly naked falsehoodswhich when made vocal  --  made glib and honey-smooth by his expressive tongue  --  would wear the illustrious garb of truth . Inelegantly , he spat over the side . " Oh , I do n't know , Petesy . Finish the play , I guess . That 's first on the agenda . Whitehead 's about to go out of his mind , he wants me to finish it so badly . But , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off the top of your head , like a Ford commercial . You 've got to think and think and suffer and suffer and think . Then there 's that eternal problem of accuracy  --  verisimilitude , I should say . For instance , this play of mine  --  well , I might as well tell you . It 's about those experiencesI had during the war in Yugoslavia . Did I tell you that ? The fact just in itself slows me down from the very beginning . Becausein order to get this  --  this verisimilitude I need so badly  --  well , for instance , details about the Serbian language , and certain street names in Dubrovnik , and various partisan passwords that I 've forgotten , things like that  --  well , in order to get these things really down pat the way I should , I 've been having to carry on this endlessly long correspondence with old Plaja . Remember the old guy I was telling you about  --  " " You mean that old hoax ? " I said . " That old fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue to allow myself to be stuffed with his forgeries and fictions , with his crooked inventions , with all the other indigestible by-products of his peerless quackery , was a prospect which at this moment I could n't bear . I felt that at least he should have spared me the degradation of a final lie ; but he had n't , and I was bursting to tell him so . " You mean that figment ! " I said . He had n't caught on . " You remember old Plaja , " he said , " the old guy 's still hale and hearty . Plans to come over for a visit soon . He 's been sort of my technical advis  --  " " Look , Mason , " I said , " why do you feel you have to lie to me ? Do you think I 'm a  --  a fool or something ? An idiot ? Do you ? " His face went pale . One shoulder pitched upward and he raised his hands , fingers outstretched placatingly toward me . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me wrong . I have n't said  --  " " What do you mean you have n't ! " I said . " You tell me these creepy cock-and-bull stories , standing there with a solemn look on your face like a Baptist deacon , and expect me to believe them ! What 's the matter with you , anyway ? You think I 'm a moron ? You think I would n't eventually somehow learn what 's true ? You call me your confidant , your pal , your dollbaby , and pull all thisp172buddy-buddy stuff and every time I turn around you 're telling me a dreary lie ! You were never in Yugoslavia ! You were a draft dodger ! That play of yours is a soap bubble ! " I was choking with fury , the dreadful callow American prep-school words ( " creepy , " " pal , " " buddy-buddy " ) I uttered with the hysteric rage of a fifthformer , and , aware of all this even as I shouted at him  --  aware of how stupidly and impossibly and absurdly young we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Mason and going to Europe , and I felt tears compounded of rheum , of indignation , and of an old weary worn-out pity and love for him brimming up in my eyes . I turned away from him . " What , Mason ? " I cried , my voice growingloose and incoherent . " Do you think I 'm that much of a fool ? You 'd better get your goddam head looked at ! " Above us at the funnel 's mouth a plume of steam exploded forth , followed by the whistle 's horrendous blast . As it went off , booming thunder around us , I felt his hand on my shoulder and turned , deafened , to see his gray , stricken face and his lips mouthingthe contours of words . Around us , people with fingers in their ears moved slowly forward toward the gangways . "  --  hurts me ! " he cried , in a sudden silence that was profound and astounding . " That hurts me , to hear you say stuff like that . " His lips trembled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , " he said bitterly , " stuff like that is  --  it 's irremediable . I mean , to think that you  --  you of all people  --  ca n't make the subtle distinction between a lie  --  between an out-and-out third-rate lie meant maliciously  --  between that , and a jazzy kind of bullshit extravaganza like the one I was telling you , meant with no malice at all , but only with the intent to edify and entertain . " His shoulder was twitching badly now , a wide arching seesawing movement ; I could almost hear the ligaments snapping with the strain . " Jesus sake , Peter ! " he burst out in a voice that was indeed hurt  --  hurt and aggrieved . " Do n't you have enough prescience to see that I was telling it all to you under the guise of truth only to see your reactions ? To see if it would stand up as a play ? To see if it was convincing to , say , someone like you whose sympathies I trust and whose aesthetic orientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours ! " I broke in . " What 's the matter with you ? Lay off her ! Lay off her , God damn you ! " And then I stopped , my mouth agape , rattled by the sudden knowledge that this was the first time I had ever really talked back to Mason  --  my first outburst , my only reprimand . For a moment I had no words . Then after a breath , I went on morep173amiably , " Really , Mason , maybe we 're all a bit neurotic and all that , but for heaven 's sake  --  " He was not to be deflected . In shaken tones he added : " If I ca n't have any faith in your reactions , Peter , then the Lord knows  --  " But then he made a futile gesture with his hand , turning back toward the rail , and wrenched from his throat a few awkward words that hurt me to the core . " Lord knows I 've tried hard to be decent and sociable enough . But every time I open my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He paused , lips trembling . It was awful . " I just always end up with everybody using me . Or hating my guts . " " I do n't hate  --  " I began , turning , but another blast from the whistle nearly lifted us from the deck . Far off in the lower depths sounded a carillon of jangling bells . " Well , Mason , " I said instead , " it looks like it 's time to break up our party . " I stuck out my hand , feeling like hell . " Many thanks for all the nice presents . Thanks really , Mason . " He moved toward me with a somber little smile , reaching for my hand . " Bon voyage , old dollbaby , " he said , " do n't get clutched up . Down one for me , will you , every now and then ? " It was the last I heard him say . His shoulder still heaving as if with palsy , he took my hand , turning that simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked longing , I think I have ever known . For like that forsaken boy  --  his face unremembered now , even his name  --  who lingers dimly in my memory of childhood , the rich little neighbor boy who  --  so it was long after told to me  --  warped or crippled or ugly , perhaps all three , when asked one day by his elders why and how and whither all his nickels and his quarters and his dimes had so swiftly vanished , burst out the confession that they had gone , each one , not for candy or toys or Eskimo pies , but to pay for the companionship of other children  --  five cents for an hour , twenty for an afternoon , a small fistful of nickels for a whole summer day : like this lost child 's , Mason 's gesture was one of recompense and hire , and laden with the anguish of friendlessness . Before I could say another word , or recovermy wits long enough to really understand what he had given me , he was gone , swallowed up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French money he had got from somewhere , all notes of ten thousand francs  --  enough to buy a solid-gold Swiss watch if I had wanted one , or a suit of Harris tweeds , or bottles of brandy without number . Mortified , I tried top174call out after him , but already he was lost from sight  --  except for one last brief glimpse I had of him at the top of a distant stairway : with his head bent down there seeking the steps he looked curiouslyclumsy and inept ; not the old breezy magician but vulnerable , bumbling and for an instant wildly confused  --  future 's darling , a man with one foot poised in the thinnest of air . Then within minutes I felt a throbbing beneath my feet and the boat began to move . Propped against the rail with the money still in my hand  --  feeling even at this terminal moment that my virtue had been pre-empted , that somehow , irretrievably , I had been bought and procured  --  I slipped seaward toward Europe with all Manhattan aglitter in my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cabinmates I got along very well : they were really gentle , accommodating fellows  --  somewhat hard to get next to , maybe , but far less depraved than Mason , it seemed to me , and a lot better adjusted . In Paris I got a letter from Mason , telling me that Celia had gone to Reno . I remember one characteristic phrase , which seemed  --  as with so much of Mason  --  to emerge from some insubstantial shadowland unacquainted either with sorrow or joy : " Weep , weep for Mason and Celia , Peter , we 've gone to Splitsville . " And it was not long after this that Mason faded from my mind . Yet I wish now I could recall the details of that shipboard dream I had , far out in mid-ocean , when I shot erect in my bunk and listened in a sweat to my fellow voyagers snoring in the dark , and smelled the sweet scent of those blossoms , slowly dying , that he had given me , and was touched all over with the somehow-knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway in his shower clogs , left me vibrating on that marble bench in Sambuco , I found it hard to get a decent grip on all my emotions . I was furious , God knows . Yet my anger , mixed as it was with a bewildering and indefinablefear of Mason , had the quality of anxiety ; flight  --  from the palace , from Sambuco  --  seemed essential , and I sat there nursingthe insult I felt , and pondered the ways in which I could make a decorous , unseen escape from the whole neighborhood . Two or three minutes must have passed . I was about to get up then , when I heard Mason 's wooden clogs click-clocking slowly back down the hallway . He entered , still walking with his strange bentoverhobbled gait , but he stood a bit more erect now and he was looking at me with such grinning , callous good humor that my fear175of him instantly vanished . No longer my Polaroid monster , he was himself , desperately plausible from top to toe . " Bet I gave you quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink , Petesy ? I have n't had time to  --  " " Go to hell ! " I retorted . " Who do you think you are , talking to me like that ! We are n't back at St. Andrew 's , and by God if you think  --  I 'm not just another one of your crummy freeloaders ! " " Petesy , Petesy , Petesy , " he murmured in his old plaintive cajoling voice . He sat down beside me and gave me a slap of palship on the shoulder . " Old Petesy with the tissue-paper skin . Look , I want to tell you  --  " " You look ! " I exclaimed , getting briskly to my feet . " I do n't know what the hell 's going on around here , but I can tell you I 've had it ! Do you think I 'm some lousy contadino  --  some peasant you can push around ? You invited me down here as your guest and I 've felt about as welcome as a case of typhoid ! If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even have gotten fed ! I think I 'll take a raincheck . Mille grazie ! Wise guy ! Jerk ! " I shouted miserably as I began to shuffle off . " Invite me back sometime when I wo n't be such a strain on your resources ! " He leaped to his feet and caught my wrist . He was still pantingfrom his recent pursuit , still sweating , and he wore an expressionabout as close to being shamefaced as he could ever approach . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I really am . I did n't know what I was saying . I was  --  well , I was hacked , upset . Please forgive me , Peter . Please do . " " Well , I 'm going , Mason , " I said faint-heartedly . " See you around the campus . " " You 'll do nothing of the kind , " he replied . " You 're going to forgive me for being a bastard . And you 're going to stay here with your old pal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stomp me ? " I said . " What 's gotten into you , Mason ? What have I done . I 'm not a criminal , a bum you can talk to like  --  " He ran one hand nervously over his brow . " I  --  I do n't know , Peter . I 'm sorry . That girl . She 's been robbing me blind . Just lifted a pair of Rosemarie 's earrings . I was upset , that 's all . I du n no , I got so exasperated I thought everybody was trying to side with her . Crazy of me ! Look , " he pleaded , " say you forgive me ! I really did n't mean it , I swear . Soon as I said it I felt like a worm . " Incorrigible to the end , I allowed nostalgia and sentimentality to win out . I averted my eyes and gripped his hand , saying : " Well ,  |p177O.K.  , Mason , O.K. " All my life I 've been addicted , in such situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , too . It was half my fault , I guess . " This seemed vaguely to cheer him up . " Right , " he said vacantly , " let 's call it bygones and to hell with it . We all make mistakes . Look , wait here a minute while I go up and put some clothes on , and I 'll show you around the plant . " And as I stood waiting there while he vanished up the stairway I was left feeling  --  like one bamboozled in an old familiar con game  --  that it was he who had pocketed my apology . He was gone for five or ten minutes . During that time I wanderedaimlessly around the deserted room , puffing at a cigarette ; I still felt nervous and rattled , especially troubled over the girl he had chased down the hallway , and whom he had obviously molestedin one way or another . I think that for a while it must have drizzled outside , for as I lingered , peering again up at the melee on the ceiling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a latter-day electrical conduit ) I heard voices buzzingbelow as the poolside crowd began to disband and made their way back up through the garden and into the palace . When Mason returned he had on a white jacket and freshly creased Bermuda shorts , and he wore a preoccupied look . " Come on , Petesy , let 's look over the plant . " His voice and manner were terse ; nonetheless , he was trying hard to please and impress me . In the next half-hour or so he showed me his den , a leathery relaxedplace done up like a whiskey ad , with elephant guns , books , bullfight posters , an ottoman made from the foreleg of a rhinoceros , and the head of an African buffalo he claimed to have slain  --  a rather pathetic beast that gazed down from the wall with the sweet , dumb , glassy expression of a Brown Swiss cow . This was a new phase of Mason 's , I reflected  --  the sporting life  --  and here in the den we lingered for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with various flashy matadors , showed me his great bullhide-bound volumes on tauromachy , which is the word he used , and , lastly , with an effrontery and shamelessness advanced even for him , described in detail the safari he had made through Kenya with a sensitive Canadian blonde . She had taken her Ph.D . at the University of Toronto , on Baudelaire 's imagery . . . but I wo n't go into it : such a rich amalgam of jackals howlingin the night , and nerve-racking trails of blood spoors down draws and gullies , and bwanas and memsahibs , and petrifying waits for a wounded beast to come plunging from the brush , orp178bush  --  all of this laced with Fleurs du mal and strong draughts of fornication on the veldt  --  a romance the likes of which you never heard . I think I must have feigned interest but my mind was far away ; all I wanted to do was to make an escape from this palace and go to sleep somewhere . Next he took me through the rest of the " plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace  --  trucked over from Naples , he said , at great expense and effort  --  the frozen food locker , and then the stainless-steel kitchen complete with Frigidaire , an expanse of cabinets , ovens , and ranges whose buttons , controls , and indicators glittered in multicoloredranks . I looked around . At a gleaming sink two local scullerymaids toiled in a cloud of steam , scraping plates for the nearby dishwasher , which grumbled and hummed like an idling Diesel engine ; beyond them in one corner old Giorgio , stripped to his galluses , was moodily amusing himself with an electric knife sharpener that sent a spine-chilling wail through the air . " I got everything wholesale at the PX , " Mason said . " Well , what do you think of it ? " " Mason , " I said , " I think it 's just grand . But tell me something  --  how did you get PX privileges ? " " There are ways , " he said inscrutably . And then he led me into a nearby alcove and showed me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which  --  a type of gluey foam  --  he claimed you could actually eat . " Fantastic , Mason , " I said . Culturally he had shifted his poles , that was plain to see ; he seemed no more self-conscious over this sudden display of pelf than he had been before over his forays into the demimonde . " Tell me , " I went on , " how come you 've got a Cadillac now ? Is n't that rather square ? " " Oh , sports cars , " he said . " They 've become such a cliche . " I should have known . Then we returned to the kitchen and were confronted by Giorgio , looking this time sour and mournful as he gave Mason what appeared to be some kind of note . " Da Francesca , " said Giorgio . " Francesca ? " Mason exclaimed , his eyes growing wide . " Where is she ? " " Dov'e , signore ? Non lo so . Ma credo the sia nella strada . " " Speak up ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , for Christ sake ? " " He said he believes she was downstairs , on the street . " " What does he mean , believes ' ? " he said , tearing open the note . " Does n't the old fool know ? "  | " Se n'e andata , " Giorgio said with a shrug , spreading his hands wide . " Finish . " " She 's gone , Mason , " I said . " Well , tell him to go find her . " I told him . More knowledgeable , apparently , than Mason knew , he shuffled away , mumbling resentfully that he was nobody 's fool . I began to fidget . Mason in the meantime , digesting the message in a glance , had turned scarlet ; puckering his lips up as if to spit , or to blurt out some blasphemy , his face became redder and redder , and he let the note fall to the floor , his eyes bugging out and looking wild as , finally , he found words to speak . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean voice , " the unspeakable , filthy dago slut . " " Mason , " I said hastily . " I think I 'll go on up to the Bella Vista . I 'm really quite beat and  --  " " They 've got the minds of criminals , I 'll swear to God , " he said . " Every goddam one of them are filthy , sneaking thieves . It 's born in them , I 'll swear , Peter , with the same predestination that makes the Germans born with blood-lust . They 've got robbery and embezzlement in their bones . No wonder they 're so goddam poor . They must rob each other blind ! " As of yore , he had begun to gyrate his miserable shoulder . " Look , Mason , " I said , " all this is very well and good , but it 's not true and I do n't want to talk about it . I 'm dead tired and I want to go to bed  --  " " Jesus Christ ! " he said , paying me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would promenade right under my nose for two  --  no , three whole months , robbing me baldheaded  --  at the wages I pay her , too !  --  robbing me with no more compunction than if she thought I was a gibbering idiot . Wiggling her criminal little twat around the house as if she owned the place  --  " And as he stood before me there in the steaming , grandiloquent kitchen , he sailed away upon a harangue so absurd and so mad that I actually thought for a brief moment he was joking : had I not heard , for Jesus sake , of Willie Morelli and Tough Tony Anastasia and such thugs as The Dasher Abbandando and Bow-legs Sarto  --  not to speak , for Jesus sake , of Luciano and Costello and Capone ? Was that not proof enough , if proof was needed , that the principal contributionof the Italian people to America if not to all humanity ( and please , Peter , he knew all about the Renaissance ) was a thievish and corrupt criminality so murderous , so immoral , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter ! " he said angrily , asp180if he sensed my silent rebuke . " Use your head ! " Did n't I know that Murder , Incorporated  --  that vicious mob of professional assassins  --  was made up almost wholly of Italians and that moreover gangsterism in America was totally controlled by a wicked pack of dope-sellers and connivers in Italy ? ( Dear old Italy . ) I had heard that , but I did n't see that  --  " Jesus ! " he cried . " Use your head ! " And then he indulged himself in one final , flamboyant , pathetic lie ( the last of his I was ever to hear ) : about a young friend of his , a Harvard-bred assistant district attorney so brilliant that his name had been bruited about New York as candidate for mayor , who , having declared a personal war on the mobsters , went out bravely incognito among them , only to be found slain one night in a vacant lot in Rego Park , Queens , mutilated so horriblythat even he , Mason , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot poker rammed up his bowel ; his genitalia . . . etc . ) . I made my mind a blank . " And the Mafia had branded their mark on his chest ! " he concluded , shaking with fury . " A bunch of miserable Italian thugs with the mentality of beasts . Look , you know I 'm not a  --  a xenophobe , of the lunatic fringe . But is n't that proof enough that the Italians have become degraded to the point of bestiality ? Do you see why I might be peeved , " he asked , with a heavy load of sarcasm , " when this dirty little twat of a housemaid has the temerity  --  the gall  --  to walk out beneath my nose with practically everything I own ? Ca n't you see how I might be vexed , to say the least ? Well , ca n't you ? " I said nothing . I could n't even bring myself to look at him , as he stood there panting and heaving . Then all of a sudden he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling me , forcing me to look up at his face . And as I stared at him , he muttered beneath his breath something which made no sense to me at all : " So it 's a lot of lowbrow diddling , that 's what it is . A cheap smelly roll in the hay . " Then he paused again , the sweat pouring off his face , smacking his palm . " Well , we 'll see about that ! " he exclaimed . He turned on his heels then and charged back through the door past the fire extinguisher , his shorts flapping around his knees as he hotfooted it down the hallway . I picked up the note he had let fall to the floor . It was in English , but in a messy , lacerated scrawl so splintered that it was barely legible . Youre in deep trouble , it read , lm going turn you in to bait for buzards . C. I thought it some sort of joke . I pocketed the note , then I trailed after Mason , despondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multi-reflected ,  |p181down  the mirrored corridor ; breezing into the foyer , past the marblebench upon which I had so lately tumbled , he made no sign or word of recognition to the scattering of guests returned from the pool , who had gathered there , but threw open the door to the stairwayof the courtyard and raced out onto the balcony . I followed in his wake , passing through the foyer too , where I had a brief glimpse in the distance of several people dancing and the black indefatigable face of Billy Raymond as he pounded the piano . And when I reached the balcony I saw that Mason was leaning over the stone parapet , bawling down into the courtyard . " Cass ! " he shouted . " Hey , Cass ! Come on up ! " But from the green door down in the shadows below there was no stir , no answer . " Cass ! " he yelled again . " Hey , Cass ! Come on up here ! " His voice , oddly , had none of the anger nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect ; it was instead only rather blunt , peremptory , as if it expected to be heard , and obeyed , and it echoed in hollow waves around the dark and lofty courtyard . " Cass ! " he cried again , but there was still no answerfrom the door ; he turned to me with an exasperated look , saying , " Now where the hell has he gone to ? " " I would n't know , Mason , " I said , utterly baffled . Some emotion shivered and shook him as he stood there  --  God knows what emotion it was . He trembled , ran his hand again across his sweaty brow . I thought he was going to burst into tears . " The jerk ! " he said in a choked voice . " The miserable jerk ! " And then , brushing past me , saying in a voice that was almost like a gasp for air , " I 'll bet Giorgio knows ! " he flung himself back through the doors and into the palace . My mystification was complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done so , no doubt  --  my foot even then poised in liberating descent upon the stairs  --  had not the green door opened at that very moment down below , sending a shaft of light across the courtyard and causing me to draw back like some hooligan ( such was the infection of Mason'spersonality ) into the shadows of the balcony . Two figures emerged from the door  --  Cass Kinsolving and a girl . I heard a soft sobbing noise from the girl , exhausted , infinitely touched with grief , and saw Cass half-stumble against the wall ; then , as they moved on slowly out into the rectangle of light , I saw that the girl was none other than the black-clad servant girl who had fallen to her knees before me in the salone . I heard them talking in lowp182unhappy tones  --  indistinctly , spiritlessly  --  their voices rising and falling alternately and then in unison in a curious , small threnody of distress , and rent at intervals by the girl 's soft , remorseless , heartbroken sobs . Irresistibly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slump against the wall , almost toppling down , and heard the girl 's voice again , as she appeared to clutch out for him , in a renewed surge of half-hysteric grief . For a long moment , leaning there against the wall , they melted together in a tormented embrace . At last I heard the single word Basta ! Then one of them said Ssss-ss , and their voices died to whispers , and for a long minute I heard no more until with a soft pitipat of bare feet the girl scampered across the courtyard , still weeping , and was gone . Alone , Cass stood at the doorway , swaying back and forth . At last with a sudden clumsy motion he turned about and pressed his cheek against the wall , clutching at the gray stone with his hands , as if trying to embrace it . I thought I heard him groan ; then the sound died and all I could hear was his heavy breathing as he stood there , the noise sibilant and greedy and agonized like that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment the door burst open once again behind me , and Mason flew to the parapet , leaning over . " Cass ! " he cried . " Come on up here ! Come on up and have a drink ! " There was no movement from the figure below : only the steady , laborious breathing . Mason called again , still not harshly but with rising impatience and with a blunt imperative tone , like that of a military person to a slow-thinking or half-deaf subordinate . " Sonofabitch , " I heard him mutter fretfully . Then he turned abruptly and clattered down the stairway , taking the steps two at a time and landing flat-footedly in the courtyard , where he paused for an instant , arms flailing about as he regained his balance and then sprinted past all the movie machines across the tiles to Cass ' side . I heard them mumbling to one another , first Mason 's voice , affable and insincere , saying , " Come on up , pal , and join the fun , " then Cass ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing more and more impatient but still under control as he gave Cass a big swat between the shoulder blades  --  " Do n't be a miserable spoilsport ! " I heard him say , louder  --  and turned him around , half-supporting him about the waist , and led him slowly back across the courtyard to the stairway . Cass was drunker than he had been an hour before , if that was possible . He looked nowp183like a man pitched on the edge of total ruin , his eyes making comic-strip X 's behind his glasses , his arms limp and powerless at his sides . At one point , as he climbed the stairs , I thought he was going to topple over the balustrade . Mason steadied him , grimly . Then when he finally lurched up to the balcony where I was standing , Cass ' eyes floated to a point several inches from my face , and I thought for an instant that he winked at me but because of the condition of his eyes I could not be sure . Mason , panting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on have a drink , " he said to him sharply . Then to me : " Cass is going to put on a little show . Cass is a real actor , when he 's had one or two under his belt . I might even get Alonzo to get him to turn professional . Is that O.K. with you , Cass ? " He tried to smile . Cass stood before us swaying , hair still in his face , grinning now  --  slackly and rather stupidly . " Sho ' , boy , anything you say , anything you say . " A crazy , witless chuckle emanated from the back of his throat . " ' M a real actor . Melpomene and Thalia . The sweet goddesses for which  --  for whom , I should say  --  old Unc Kinsolving would die . Willingly . " He paused and hiccupped . " Willingly . No bullshit , boy . Born to the buskin . Thespis me middlename . Unc 'll do anything for a drink . " Sweating wildly , he looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , man . None of this old cookin ' whiskey , either . None of this ol ' rotgut that 'd burn the craw out of a turkey buzzard . Sip pin ' whiskey ! That 's what Mason serves . Gentry whiskey ! Good ol ' sour mash what never saw the light of day for eight whole years . Tell me , old Mason buddy , " he said , laying a big hand on Mason 's shoulder , hiccupping again , " tell me , boy , you got any that Jack Daniel 's we picked up at the PX today ? Any left for old Unc Kinsolving ? " From the eloquent , warm-natured , animated person I had encountered that afternoon he had changed into a played-out lush , wheedling and foolish . I felt undermined , disappointed . He was just another one of Mason 's sycophants . " Sure , Cass , " said Mason . " You can have all you want . Soon as we put on our little show . " And he laughed as he once more grabbed Cass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was a mean glint in his eye . The back of his neck was the color of a boiled lobster ; he was seething , and I knew that I could expect the worst . " Come on , lover man , " he said sarcastically , pushing Cass along with soft pokes at his shoulder . " Come on , boy . Let 's show the folks some real entertainment . "  |p184Just  then  --  just as we were about to enter the foyer  --  I heard a small shrill cry from below and another patter of feet crossing the courtyard . I drew back several steps and looked down . It was Poppy . Dressed in a flowered kimono and socks , her yellow hair now most unbeautifully cemented to her head by curlers and bobby pins , she mounted the steps pell-mell , gasping , puffing as she reached the top , where , with small fists clenched and her face red with pouty outrage like a child 's , she fell on Mason and began to tug furiously at his arm . " Mason Flagg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard what you 're up to , you mean person ! You let Cass alone ! Do you hear me ? You let him alone ! " In her faded kimono , she looked worn and poor , but she was lovely . Mason turned on her . " Go on away ! " he snapped . Then he added more temperately , with his forced smile : " Take it easy , Poppy . We 're just going to have us a little fun . Is n't that right , Cass ? " " Do n't say anything to him , Cass ! " Poppy shrilled , in a frenzied , broken voice . " He 's going to mistreat you ! He 's just going to shame and humiliate you like he did before ! " She glared up at Mason  --  bristling with fury , her eyes brimful with tears and hugely round  --  still tugging at his arm . " Why are you such a mean , evil person ! " she cried . " Why do you want to do this to him ! Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you know he loses all command of himself when he 's like this ? Oh please , " she wailed , with a despairing , imploring gaze , " please leave him alone and let me put him to bed ! Do n't shame him any more ! " She glared at me , pleading . " Please , Mr. Leverett , please make him stop . He 's so sick , Cass is ! And now Mason wants to put him on display ! " She wheeled again on Mason and stamped her foot . " You brute ! It 's not funny any more , Mason ! It 's horrible . Oh , I hate you ! I hate you ! I hate you ! " And she put her face in her hands and began to cry . " Maybe you 'd better let him alone like she says , " I suggested . " Maybe you 'd better , Mason . " " You keep out of this , Buster Brown , " he retorted , throwing me a look of contempt . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belatedness , considering what had passed between us since I landed in Sambuco ) that I realized for the first time that Mason , in the midst of all his gross and preposterous dissimulation , actually disliked me as much as I did him . Each of us had changed , at last , beyond recapture . His eyes lingered on me . " You keep out of this , hear ? " he repeated , and he turned briefly to Poppy , cast/ing her a look of amusement and disdain . Then , " Come on , Lochinvar , " he said brusquely to Cass , " in we go . " Cass stumbled heavily against the door . " Thass all right , my girl , my little girl , " he said in a thick garbled voice to Poppy , regaininghis balance . " Do n't you cry for me . Me an ' of Mason gon na have us a ball , is n't we , pal ? Fun and games , like always . How 's about a little tiny nip of that Jack Daniel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mason said nothing and pushed Cass forward . Poppy trailed in their wake , tears streaming down her face . " Quiet , everybody ! Quiet , please ! " Mason clapped his hands , and his voice boomed through the huge room , bringing the music to a stop and causing the dancers to halt in their tracks . " Quiet , please ! " Mason shouted again . He was grinning broadly but his jacket was drenched in sweat : he seemed eaten up by some furiousinner agitation . " Quiet ! " he cried . " Will the ladies and gentlemen present please gather around for the evening 's special attraction ! Kindly step forward in this direction if you will ! " Slowly the guests edged forward to the place where Mason and Cass were standing in the foyer . The party had thinned out considerably . It must have been close to two , and many of the people had retired , I supposed , to the Bella Vista or to their rooms in the palace . Alice Adair was gone , as were Morton Baer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward us and , among the others , Rosemarie and the crew-cut young man , who had become cross-eyed drunk , and my other bete-noire , the assistant director Van Rensselaer Rappaport . In all , I imagine a dozen people were left , and while Mason shouted and clapped his hands they gathered in a cluster around him . " Wot happen your pretty face , darlings ? " said Gloria Mangiamelewith a giggle , sidling up to Mason and putting an arm around him . " I fell into a thicket , " he replied abstractedly . " Will all you people  --  " " Ticket ? " said Mangiamele , puzzled . " How can one fall into a ticket ? " I glanced at Rosemarie : she was a pale portrait of misery . " Will all you people please come closer ? Thank you . Tonight we have for you a special surprise attraction , " he said , gesturing toward Cass . His voice had become rich and magniloquent , like that of a circus ringmaster , and his face still wore the stiff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present to you ladies and gentle/men Cass Kinsolving , the greatest personality , the greatest onemanshow since the days of the great departed Jolson . Is n't that right , Cass ? Speak up , Cass . Let 's have your pedigree . " For an instant in the background I saw Poppy , biting her lip and fighting back tears , reach out to clutch at Cass , but he was lurching forward now , grinning his foolish grin , and with lumberingsteps he moved up and came to a standstill next to Mason , where he remained weaving and grinning like some shambling burly bear in the center , so to speak , of the stage . His T-shirt hung sloppily out around his hips , his pants were stained , his glasses askew upon his flushed and perspiring face ; standing there yawingprecariously he looked husky and vaguely professorial and afflicted by some profound , voiceless melancholy , despite his grin , like a lost and drunken scholar on a Bowery corner , contemplatinghis inward ruin . Among these suavely varnished people , he did indeed look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Mangiamele giggle , then someone else laughed . There was a stir of anticipation in the crowd , a rustle of dresses . " He 's simply priceless , " I heard a French accent murmur , and turned to see the neck of an elderly fairy craning over my shoulder . Rosemariehad pointed him out to me earlier : a celebrated couturier  --  Jacques Something-or-other -- of whom I should have heard , but had n't . His neck was a pinkish neck , and wattled , like a vulture 's . " Where on earth did Mason find him ? " " Come on , " Mason repeated impatiently , " come on , Cass . Let 's have the old pedigree . " Cass hesitated for a second , scratching his head . " In answer to your application , my parentage and age , et cetera , " he said finally , in a thick voice , " my mother was a bus horse . . . my father a cab driver . . . my sister a rough rider over the arctic regions . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It took no time at all to say . He said it mechanically , dreamily , as if by rote , and when he had finished he grinned again at Mason , in search of approval . It was a look that seemed so automatic , so predetermined , that I almost expected Mason to throw him a fish , or a hunk of meat . For a moment there was a complete silence  --  a silence you could touch , fraught with an overwhelming , general bafflement and uneasiness . I felt myself tensing up and sweating . No one uttered a sound . And then as Mason , still smiling , fixed upon Cass his intense , magisterial gaze , someone on the other side of me laughed . It was a hoarse , masculine laugh  --  raw and sidesplitting  --  andit had the instant quality of contagion : someonep187next to me began to guffaw , then another , then another , until the whole crowd was let loose upon a flood of whooping , hysterical laughter which rebounded from the ceiling and the walls and washed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed ; and they laughed , I suppose , because they were at that stage in drunkenness , or inertia , or boredom , where they were ready to laugh at anything . In the midst of it all Cass stood with the sweat glistening from the bristles of a stubbly beard , dreamy and remote , oblivious of the racket , grinning and swaying as if upon his far-off and desolate street corner . There was a quality about him so totally spent , so defeated , that it was almost repellent . All of his vigor and manhood seemed drained away , and his big muscular hands fell limp and flaccid at his sides ; he grinned , giggled a bit , gave a sudden lurch sideways , righted himself . Then finally the laughter diminished , died . Mangiamele , who I was sure had not understood half of Cass ' brief speech , still wheezed and trembled with convulsive laughter , breasts heaving , hands upthrust in helpless mirth to her lovely empurpled face . Betweenspasms she paused to stare at Cass with a look of simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a brain than a gnat . Mason disengaged her arm from his waist , stepping forward . " Well done , Cass boy , " he said . " Now how about the Honest Abe bit ? " " Sho ' , man , " Cass replied sluggishly . " Sho ' . Anything you say . " " Billy , " Mason said to the colored piano player , " how about a few bars of Old Black Joe ' ? " He turned and addressed the gathering . " This , good people , is a song about Honest Abe Lincoln . For the benefit of the non-Americans present , Lincoln was a president of the U.S.A. , the Great Emancipator , also something of a liar and a slob , though you 'd never know it . " There was an appropriatetitter as Mason once again retired , pushing Cass forward , and the piano , maestoso , set loose the first chords of " Old Black Joe . " Cass sang , in a thick glutinous voice . " I 'm Honest Abe , With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , My face is . . . on . . . the . . . fin . . . " The tempo was excruciatingly slow . I thought he would never get the words out . Worse , he had no voice at all , so that as he stoodp188there with his eyes squinted shut and strove to track the gentle melody down its labyrinthine way , he hit no note at all on key but hoarsely blurted out each word almost at random , and was several beats behind everywhere . His voice was almost drowned out in the hoots and wails of merriment . " I nev-er toleNo-thin but . . . the . . . truth . . . Howcome you pulled the trigger on me , John . . . Wilkes . . . Booth ? " The laughter showered around him , wave on wave . He stood with his eyes closed , as if dreaming , grinning his sleepy grin , deaf to all . " Now the Rebel yell ! " Mason shouted above the uproar . " Do n't forget the Rebel yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been shocked out of some profound and amnesic sleep , came suddenlyalive . He threw back his head and cupped his hands around his mouth and let out an ear-splitting , screeching noise which sent shivers running up and down my back . " YAIHeeeeeeee ! " he howled . " YAHOO-eeeeeeee ! " Over and over he roared the pointless , bloodcurdling phrase , screeching like a banshee or like one demented , while the crowd around me , convulsed , visibly wilting beneath the onslaught , clutched one another , grinning as they averted their faces and clapped their hands against their ears . Cass howled on , like some ferocious horn or whistle running wild , unstoppered by Mason 's perverse and unfathomablewill . " YAIHeeeeeeee ! " Senselessly he kept bellowing his outlandish cry , until I thought it would bring the plaster crumblingfrom the walls . The two scullery maids , trailed by Giorgio , popped out into the hallway wringing their hands , eyes rolling white with terror , and a Persian cat sprang from nowhere , its fuzz raised in stiff alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then other people appeared . Like a churchyard transfigured by the trump of Judgment Day , the palace began to disgorge its slumberers , who with dressing gowns and bathrobes wound around them came forth squinting , barefooted , and with the aspectsof those who foresee unspeakable horror . Pasty-white , Dawn O'Donnell was first , followed by Alice Adair , and then a couple of wild-haired Italian men in their underdrawers , and finally Alonzo Cripps , looking tense and insomniac and with a cigarette twitching upon his lips . It was he  --  when Cass ' screams finally subsided  --  who approached Mason with an air of incredu/lity , and became the first to speak up . " What the hell 's going on , Mason ? " he said . " Just having a little fun , Alonzo . Cass here 's entertaining the folks . He 's what in show business we call a laugh riot . Is n't that right , Cass ? " " Sho ' , boy , " Cass replied in an empty voice , between wheezes . " Sho ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little nip of that Jack Dan  --  " " We thought someone was being murdered , " said Dawn O'Donnell . " Well , how about keeping it down a bit , " Cripps said . " Some of us have to work tomorrow . " He was in a spot : he was obviously raging but he kept himself in check , I 'm sure , because Mason was his host . He turned then , and his eyes fell on Cass , registeringpain . " Why do n't you lay off him , Mason ? " he said quietly . " I do n't think this sort of thing is particularly funny any more . What 's the point , anyway ? I 'd think you 'd had enough by now . Look at him . " Cass turned groggily , and made a slow military salute , Britishstyle , palm turned out over his eyebrow . " Good evening , Director . Glad to have you aboard . " " Leave him alone , why do n't you ? " Cripps said almost amiably , holding himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason ? " It was a moment which should have been tenser than it was : what Cripps had said , after all , had been in the nature of a challenge , and a public one at that . But the guests  --  harmoniously convivial , well soused , and desperately bored  --  echoed none of Cripps ' feeling . They buzzed and chortled : " Go on back to bed , Alonzo , " I heard someone say ; their cheeks were red and their armpits were wet and they were out for entertainment  --  or blood . Even the roused sleepers joined in the happy mood  --  Alice and Dawn , moving in closer for a better view , and the two Italians who in their jockey shorts looked as poised and unruffled as a couple of ambassadorsand scratched their hairy bellies , sniggering , and relaxed . " Do n't be a hard-nose , Alonzo , " said Mason airily . " Jesus sake , get yourself some sleep . The party 's just begun . " And then Mason made Cass recite a long series of limericks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been amused before , they were now nearly helpless , and in their merriment they got careless with their elbows and stepped on each other 's feet , and my own , and sloshed whiskey all down their wrists.  | " The director of the American Academy , " Cass recited in his solemn lethargic tone . " Has a most peculiar anatomy . . . " His eyes were glazed , and he was no longer smiling ; all the blood had drained from his face and the sweat seemed to have evaporated from his brow , leaving him looking parched and dry and accentuating that expression he had had at first , on the stairs , of pale sickness or of poison . He finished the verse in a husky , broken voice , tinged and tired with melancholy . The laughter crashed around him . " Hoo ! . . . hoo ! . . . hoo ! " The voice of the French dressmakerwas shrill in my ear , and I suddenly realized that it had been steady and constant all along  --  an unwavering high-pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mason , chuckling , patting him on the back . " Now the one about the maiden from Nassau . And then the one about the lewd Prioress  --  Chatham , or you know what . " And then , as Cass began to croak out another limerick and as I gazed at him , keeping Mason in the corner of my eye , all of those feelings and suspicions and apprehensions which had been stirring about at the back of my consciousness suddenly jerked into place in the forefront of my mind , made vividly clear . Mason had Cass , had him securely in hand , just as in an entirely different but no less impregnable way  --  up until this night , at least  --  he had had me . And as I looked at Cass , and as then I looked at Mason  --  at that slick , arrogant , sensual , impenitentlyyouthful , American and vainglorious face to which I had paid for so long my guilt-laden fealty  --  I shuddered at the narrownessof my escape , and at my ignorance . And I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a thunderoushullabaloo , surpassing all yet for hysteria , and now it occurred to me that stranger , even more abominable things were taking place . " This 'll shatter you , " I heard Mason say , in what seemed a remote and unreal voice  --  only half-heard because my attention was now fixed upon two babies in nightgowns who had crept wide-eyed through the door . They were Cass '  --  the oldest boy and the oldest girl  --  and they gazed with searching , lovely , bewildered eyes around the room until they spied Poppy and hand in hand marched swiftly to her side . Deep silent sobs racked her gentle frame , and she bit in anguish at the sleeve of her kimono , and with one hand gathered her children to her as she watched the scene . Rosemarie , I noticed , had vanished from the room.  | " O.K. O.K. , Cass , " I heard Mason say , his back turned now . " You 'll get something to drink . After the exhibition bit . " " Oh , stop him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the hubbub . " Stop  --  " " This is an authentic re-creation of a Paris exhibition , as practicedonly in the highest-class establishments of Montmartre . Proceed , Cass , old dollbaby . " And in cold horror I saw Cass get down onto his knees . " Messieurs , dames , c'est comme-ci que l'on fait l'amour en Norvege . " He leered up drunkenly at the bemused guests , amber disks of light glinting from his glasses . As big and as hulking as he was , hunched over like a great desolate animal in this ignoble posture , his voice with its flawless accent was a simper , a prissy obscene lilt at once high-pitched and vacuous and dripping over with apathy  --  a perfect imitation of a Paris whore . " In Norway , the way they do it . . . " And then , stupidly licking his lips , adjusting his feet , his long maniac 's hair dangling down over his face , he poised himself to duplicate in parody that act which even the Paphian gods above  --  had they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such degradation . " En Norvege . . . " But he never made it , and the crowd had no more time to laugh . For an instant I saw myself in that same position  --  clownish , prostrate , and dishonored . I sprang to his side  --  beaten there by Alonzo Cripps , who , pulling Cass to his feet , supporting him , looked at Mason with black loathing . " That 'll be enough of this , do you hear ? " Cripps said . " But Jesus , Alonzo  --  " Mason began in a whine . " That 'll be enough , I said . " Poppy pushed through the crowd toward Cass and fell on his shoulder , sobbing . His head was lolling on his chest . " Sorry , my little girl , " I heard him say in a muffled , stricken voice . " Oh Christ , I 'm sorry . " I suppose Cripps sensed in me an ally . " Why do n't you help get him downstairs ? " he murmured . I was holding Cass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a disgusting business in all my life . " This was an aside from Cripps , but I know that Mason heard it . " Jesus sake , Alonzo , " Mason began , " it was only fun and games  --  " But Cripps had already vanished down the hallway . An admirable man , above sordid involvements . The guests dispersed quietly , melting into the night . I have no clear idea what their reactions were , being too busy with Cass to tell or care , but they were silent , and the silence seemed to be anp192unregenerate one , full of sulkiness and disappointment rather than shame . Together with Poppy , and with the children tagging after , I tugged and labored Cass toward the door . " Why are you up , children ? " Poppy said , sniffling . Then she turned back and looked at Mason , standing alone with a baffled , unhappy expression in the foyer . " Mason Flagg ! " she cried . " You 're a dirty , wicked man ! " He made no reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I added , as we staggeredout the door . Since they were the last words I said to him ever , they have caused me more than one twinge of remorse , in spite of all he did . " I 've got to get sober , I 've got to get sober , " he muttered beneath his breath , over and over . " Got things to do . Thanks , Leverett . Poppy , make me a whole lot of hot coffee . I 've got to get sober . " We pushed and pulled Cass through the cable-tangled courtyard . " Well , for heaven 's sake , Cass , " said Poppy in her small childishvoice , panting as she tugged him along . " Heaven 's sakes alive ! I told you to get sober this morning . You just wo n't listen to me ! You 're just a  --  a reprobrate , that 's all . " " Reprobate , " he mumbled . " I 've got to get sober . " " You 're so obstinate , Cass , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They saw you doing that disgusting thing ! " " We saw you ! " the children chimed in from behind . Slim in their nightgowns , their eyes dark and grave , they looked as bright and beautiful and fresh as a couple of daisies . " We saw you , Daddy ! " " Oh , Mama ! " Cass groaned , stumbling over a cable . " Did I really do what I think I did ? " " Think of your ulcer ! " Poppy said . " Jesus God , I 'm a lunatic . Sober me up ! " We entered through the green door and into the Kinsolvings ' part of the palace . This  --  or at least as much of it as I could discoverat first glance  --  was a cavernous , dimly lit room with large French doors at the far end which , like Mason 's , gave out upon the somber , twinkling sea . Otherwise there was no resemblance to Mason 's dwelling , and perhaps it was just the comedown , or letdown , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeping and grubby disorder . Or perhaps it was the diaper on the floor at the entranceway , which made a wet sloshing noise beneath my feet . Whatever , as Cassp193lurched forward and fell face downward on a ratty couch and as Poppy hurried off with the children into another room , I was certain , as I stood there blinking , that I had never seen such squalor . Dishes and coffee cups were everywhere . In the air hovered a troublesome , gamy , enigmatic odor not precisely , but not far removedfrom , decay , as of a place where garbage cans languish days on end in unfulfillment . The piled-up stumps of cigars protrudedfrom half a dozen ashtrays , or had been squashed down into empty wine and Coca-Cola bottles , one of which still fulminatedwith greenish , greasy smoke . Comic books in Italian litteredthe floor , where Mickey Mouse had suffered a change to Topolino , along with Stefano Canyon and Il Piccolo Abner and Superuomo . Across one half of the room a bediapered clothesline sagged damp-looking and redolent , while from the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tattered rag doll grotesquely dangled with stricken button eyes , as from a gallows . Upon his couch Cass called out loudly and hoarsely to Poppy for coffee . Then as I accustomed my eyes to the haze in this benightedroom , I saw what at first I was certain was the wraith of Pancho Villa come out from the distant shadows  --  a young , round-faced , mustachioed carabiniere , bandoliered to the neck and flashing his white front teeth in a yawn , who clanked and rattledobscurely as he approached through a swarm of flies and greeted me with a melancholy " Buonase ' ! " I fairly expected , in the morbid state I was in , to be arrested , but the cop  --  languidly picking his teeth as he strolled past me  --  paid me no attention as he sauntered over to the couch and laid his hand on Cass ' shoulder . " Povero Cass , " he sighed . " Sempre ubriaco . Sempre sbronzo . Come va , amico mio ? O.K. ? " His voice was subdued , sad , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard his muffled voice from the pillow , in lazy , fluid Italian : " Not so O.K. , Luigi . Uncle 's had a bad night . Sober me up , Luigi . I 've got things to do . " Bending over him , the cop spoke in his gentle tones . " You got to go to bed , Cass . Sleep . That 's the best thing for you . Sleep . What you 've got to do can wait till morning . " Cass rolled over with a groan , laying his forearm over his eyes , breathing hoarsely . " Jesus , " he said , " it 's all going round and round . I 'm a lunatic , Luigi . What time is it ? What in God 's name are you doing here at this hour ? " " Parrinello put me on night duty . The swine . Again I 'll swear it 's because I 'm an intellectual , and he 's an unreasoning block/head who despises thought . " ( An intellectual policeman ! I could hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You remember my telling you  --  " Cass interrupted him with another groan from the couch . " Come off it , Luigi . My heart bleeds for you as ever . But I 've got real troubles . I 've got to get sober . Poppy ! " he yelled . " Hurry up with that coffee ! " He rolled over on his side , blinking up at the policeman . " What time did you say it was ? I 've got bugs in my head . " " After two o'clock , Cass , " said Luigi . " I was up by the hotel . There 's some cinema equipment outdoors that I 'm supposed to keep an eye on . You know these peasants from the valley ; they 'd dismantle a steamboat and haul it away , give them the time and the opportunity . Anyway , I heard the glorious strains of Mozart , very loud , coming from the palace , and I knew you were up . So I came for a chat , and what did I find ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . Poppy gone . The bambini gone . Only the record machine going ss-put , ss-put , ss-put ! I shut it off , and sat down to watch after the other two children . It was n't like you to leave the machine on like that . You 'll ruin Don Giovanni that way . Cass eased himself up and sat on the edge of the couch , looking woozily around him . " Thanks , Luigi , " he said . " You 're a prince . Jesus , I really saw a big vacuum there for a while . A big fantastic vacuum . You could hear me all the way to the hotel ? It 's a wonder Sergeant Parrinello himself was n't down on me . " He shook his head violently , as if to clear it of the obstructing shadows . I sensed a battle and a struggle : he seemed , very gradually , to be emerging from the shrouds of his drunkenness , like a beleaguered swimmer hauling himself up inch by inch onto the dry safeguarding shore . He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hand , as if dislodging water from his ears . " Let me think , " he said , then more loudly : " Let me think ! What have I got to do ? " His eyes caught mine and he gave a start : I think he had forgotten about my presence entirely . " Well , " he said in English with a smile , " old man Leverett . By God , I think I owe you something , althoughwhat , " he added , taking off his glasses and massaging his weary , red-rimmed eyes , " what , and for what , and how much I have no way of telling . " He got up , his arm outstretched to shake my hand , but stumbled on one of the unnumbered nameless objectslittering the floor and , collapsing back onto the bed again , began to cough hoarsely and in racking spasms . " Questi sigarip195italiani ! " he howled at Luigi between fits of coughing . " What are they made of , these cigars ! Dung of goats ! Excrement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! hack !  --  I 've got to be x-rayed . I 'm turning to mush inside  --  hack !  --  the way I torment my poor old bag of guts ! Sober me up , for the love of God ! I 've got things to do ! " " Povero Cass , " Luigi breathed sympathetically , " why do you persist still in drowning yourself , abusing yourself , annihilating yourself ? Why do n't you take a pill and go to sleep ? " I scrutinized Luigi in the dim light . He was a well-built , neatly barbered young man , not unhandsome despite a tendency to beetle brows and an expression , common to cops everywhere , of dogged , almost prayerful humorlessness . Frowning down at Cass , he looked tired and discontented : cops the world over are underpaid , but where the blue eyes of a New York policeman are often terrifying , and those of a Parisian spiteful and hysteric , the eyes of an Italian carabiniere reflect only a ceaseless , calm , melancholy yearning for money , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else , he is constantly beingbribed . " Why do you persist on this dangerous course , Cass ? " he said . " Have n't I been trying to impress on you for months the terrible hazards of this way of life of yours ? Do n't you know that the consequences may very well prove fatal ? Do n't you know that the trouble in your stomach is no longer a laughing matter ? And without , I hope , sounding too pompous , may I ask you whether in your heart of hearts you have really pictured to yourself the whole horrible vista of eternity ? " " Gesu Cristo ! " I heard Cass moan . " An Italian Calvinist ! " Luigi looked at me mournfully , briefly , the expression that of a doctor who has just divined the worst . " No , Cass , " he went on to the supine figure , still racked with coughs , " no , my dear friend , I am not a religious man , as you all too well know  --  " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cass replied in a tempered , casual voice . " How could you be a Fascist , Luigi ? " " I 'm not a religious man , " Luigi went on , ignoring him , " and this you well know . However , I studied among the humanist philosophers  --  the Frenchman Montaigne , Croce , the Greek Plato , not to speak , of course , of Gabriele D'Annunzio  --  and if there 's one thing of the highest value I 've discovered , it is simply this : that the primary moral sin is self-destruction  --  the wish for death which you so painfully and obviously manifest . I exclude madness , of course . The single good is respect for the force of life . Have you not pictured to yourself the whole horrible vista ofp196eternity ? I 've told you all this before , Cass . The absolute blankness , it niente , la nullita , stretching out for ever and ever , the pit of darkness which you are hurling yourself into , the nothingness , the void , the oblivion ? Yet are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful , it is nothing to the moral sin you commit by willing yourself out of that life-force so celebrated by D'Annunzio , and by willing thus , to doom your wife and children to the hell of fatherlessness , to the unspeakable  --  " " Luigi , you 're a crackpot , " Cass said in an offhand tone , getting to his feet . " I love you like a brother  --  " He turned to me with a grin , planting , at the same time , his big hand on Luigi 's shoulder . He was still as high as a kite , and he swayed a bit , but he had lost that distant look of oblivion which had been all over his face during the fiasco upstairs . " He 's really a great fellow , Leverett , " he said , still in Italian . " Why do n't you two shake hands , you two intellectuals ? " Gravely , and with a polite dignified bow , Luigi took my outstretched hand . " Imagine a lovely fellow who 's a Fascist ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdin your life ? Look at him  --  a Fascist ! And he would n't hurt a little bird ! " " I 'm no one 's weakling , " Luigi said stiffly . " Of course you 're not , " Cass said , gouging him amiably in the ribs . " Of course you 're not , my friend . But you 're a crackpot . You should n't be an Italian cop , making next to nothing in a little miserable town in Campania , getting corns all over your feet . You should take off that uniform and go to Southern California . You 'd make millions ! Luigi Migliore , Consultant in Humanist Philosophy ! With your looks you 'd make a treasure , besides getting all the loving you could possibly handle . Why all those crazy , desiccated , brainless women would be over you like grease . You 'd have an office , and a couch , and you could get one of those beautiful dumb California blondes on the couch and gabble to her about that noble humanist philospher , Gabriele D'Annunzio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about two seconds you 'd be up to your groin  --  pardon me  --  in love , you 'd  --  " " It 's tasteless to joke about such matters , " Luigi said bleakly . " Besides , as you know , I have no desire to go to America . I 'm earnestly worried about you , Cass . " " Sciocchezze ! " Cass said , throwing up his hands . " I never heard such nonsense in my life . All Italians want to go to America . All of them ! Why do n't you break down and admit it , Luigi ? You love America . You adore it ! Do n't try to fool Uncle Cass. "  | " I should prefer not to talk about it , " Luigi replied , frowning . " And I see no point in remaining here if it 's your scheme in mind to make me out a fool . You try my patience , Cass . You protest your friendship but you joke too much . I attempt constantly to be your friend , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " lie paused and shrugged . " I 've simply been trying to help , and you make jokes . " " I know it , Luigi , I know it , " said Cass . " I 'm a hopeless drunk on the skids , and I need a helping hand . I love you like a brother . You 've been my shield and defender , besides drinking up all my vermouth . But please do n't babble on about the horrible vista of eternity . How in God 's name do you know what eternity is like ? You 're just trying to scare me , Luigi . " " Eternity is horrible to contemplate , " he said without humor . " Nullita , oscurita , like never-ending snow . That is my conception of it . A dark whiteness  --  " " What absurdity , Luigi ! Suppose I told you why dying was good ? Suppose I told you that eternity was a soft quiet place , with grass and rocks and running water , and blue sky above , and sheep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Suppose I told you , my dear friend , that eternity was not too unlike the lovely little village of Tramonti back in the valley , which you so ignore and despise ? Suppose I told you that eternity was like slaking one 's thirst in a spring of waters that comes down from the snows of the Apennines , where one may lie under the cedars and see all the sweet girls dancing and capering far off on a sunny lawn , and lie there , in endless serenity and repose ? Suppose I told you that ? What would you think , Luigi ? Would I be right or would you ? Would you believe me ? " " I would think , " said Luigi , solemn as an owl , " I would think that you would be indulging in middle-class romanticism . You would be telling me a mawkish fable . As D'Annunzio says , All life is here and now  --  ' " " Vero , Luigi ! I do believe you 're right . But let 's cease this feverishchatter . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hey , Poppy ! " he yelled again over his shoulder . " Porta it caffe , subito ! E due aspirine ! " He turned to me with a slow grin , continuing casually , almost unconsciously , in that limpid , flowing Italian at which he seemed to be as enviably adept as at his native tongue . " I can only offer you a glass of Sa:nhuro rosso , " he said , adding , " my wine steward absconded with the keys and left us clean out of Jack Daniel's. "  | " No thanks , " I said in American , " but I could do with some coffee and a couple of those aspirins . " " Quattro aspirine ! " he roared at Poppy . Then , sitting down on the couch once more , his shoulders lurching unsteadily , he proceeded to go about uncorking a bottle of red wine . Luigi regarded him sadly and soberly . " I have to be going back to my giro , Cass . I find myself greatly upset at leaving you in this condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine ? I think you 're mad . " He put his cap on his head and made a slow move toward the door . " Now I think you 're mad . I find it impossible to deal with madmen . They will surely take you to Salerno and put you in the lunatic asylum . And everyone will be grievously sorry  --  except no doubt yourself . But there 's nothing more that I can do . Buonanotte . " And with a lingering , dismal , hangdog expressionhe drifted out through the doorway , popping his head back in for one last minatory utterance : " I have seen the madhouse in Salerno with my own eyes . I have seen it , Cass . It surpasses anything you can imagine . It is medieval . " Then he was gone . " Wonderful guy , " Cass said , struggling with the cork . " Should be a lawyer in Naples or something , instead of a hick cop , but I guess he 's too much of a nut . You never saw such a weird mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about him sometime . Also a mystic . Jesus ! " He uncorked the bottle with a pop . " Have a shot of Sambuco rosso . " " No thanks , " I said , " I 'll stick with that coffee . " I paused . " Why do n't you lay off it for a while , Cass ? " I said as offhandedly as possible . " After all , you said yourself you wanted to dry out , you had things to do . . . " He gazed long at the bottle and at the floor , then looked up at me with an ingratiating smile . He hesitated ; several flies began to make a drowsy , buzzing sortie around our heads . " Well by God , " he said finally , " you know , you could n't be righter . A bleeding sweet guardian angel , that 's what you are . Come down from the heavens to deliver poor old Cass from the gorge of the predacious nobby anthropoid . To deliver from his wan lips this cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of poison . " Suddenly he heaved the bottle away across the room ; falling unbroken , miraculously , among the litter on the floor , it left a long splash of crimson against the wall . " I never did that in my life before . " He chuckled . Then he flopped back on the couch and with his khaki-clad legs in the air began to howl in English and in Italian . " Brutto maiale ! The filthy dog ! God give me strength , give me fortitude ! Mother/defiling jackal ! God make my hand strong ! " He commenced to shudder and hack at the same time , horribly , and raised one big muscular fist toward the ceiling . " Vigliacco ! Masturbator of small children ! Putrescent shark ! Oh Jesus , give me strength ! Jesus ! Is there no justice ? Must I be deprived of wealth and wit and sanity and pride , and then be deprived of guts ! Jesus love me ! " he roared as if in entreaty to the heavens . " Is there no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way , Lord ! Ah my my , give me the guts to face him down and I 'll drag him by his moldy balls through the new Jerusalem ! " Abruptly he ceased and lay back with a tremendous shudder and a sigh . Then after a spell of silence he said with a groan , and in a leaden stricken voice which had no longer any exuberance in it , or humor , but only the pure accents of despair : " Somebody 's dying , Leverett . Somebody 's dying and I 've got to help . I 've got to be sober enough to be a clever thief . " He paused for a moment , and while I tried to figure out what he was getting at I heard his breath going in and out in a husky agitated whistle . " I hate to put you out . You 've been a prince . But somebody 's dying . And I do n't mean me . No bullshit , boy . This is a heavy matter . If you could  --  if you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , and give me a shot of something , and help fix me so I could  --  so I could burglarize this item , I 'd be eternally grateful . I 've got to steady up , boy . You 've done a noble  --  " At this moment Poppy in her sleazy kimono , still coifed in unsightly curlers , rustled through the door with a potful of coffee . " Well , Cass Kinsolving , " she said with a scowl , " will you please finally just quit hollering like an elephant or something and go to bed ? " She set down two cups before us and poured the coffee ; on the surface of mine I saw rising one of her blond hairs . " You 're the limit , Cass , " she said as she swished about . " The very limit ! Getting drunk over and over again and letting Mason shame and humiliate you like that . And now you 're keeping the children awake ! Why do n't you try to be nice for a while ? " As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluttered sideboard , I studied her charming little face . Even in curlers and with cold cream in shiny gloss upon her cheeks she was like a sprite , touchingly , unelaborately lovely and slightly wild ; there was something about her both unearthly and demure : she looked as if she might have flitted out of a wood . " And you use your awful words , " she went on . " When you get this way . I 've been trying to teach the children proper English and proper Italian and you use thosep200terrible words . Not to even speak , " she added , her nostrils flaring angrily , " of the name of Our Father . Jiminy , Cass ! Do n't you see what it can do to their psychology ! " She threw two orange-colored pellets onto the table . " What are these ? " Cass inquired unhappily . " Baby aspirin , " she said . " That 's all there is . It 's from that bottleMason got us  --  Oh , that terrible person ! " " Lord God , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " Lord God , Poppy , why do n't you minister to me ! I 've got a headache ! " He looked up at her briefly and dizzily ; then he looked at me , as if calling upon me to witness his affliction . He shook his head and slurped noisily at the coffee . " It 's a trick on the menfolk , " he said sadly . " He filled us full of hormones and He made us commit the act of darkness and in the glory of our youth He struck us down with a blight of screeching tadpoles . An evil trick . Look around you , Leverett ! Did you ever see such a misbegotten abomination of a draggle-assed quagmire ? This is supposed to be my studio  --  pardon the pretension . I used to paint and things like that . Look at it , for Christ sake ! Mickey Mouse . Diapers . Dolls . Old venerable anchovies underneath the couch ; that 's that stench you smell , they 've been there for months . Are you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this portrait of dosmes  --  excuse me , domesticity , and take heed . Marry a Catholic , and it 's like being retired to stud . Did you ever see anything like it ? I 'll swear before Christ nothing exists like it west of the slums of Bangkok . Did you ever see its likes before ? Lord , my head aches ! " " The place looks fine to me , " I said , lying extravagantly as I gazed up at Poppy . " Well goodness , Cass , " she exclaimed , " it 's not as neat as it could be , but if you 're so smart why do n't you take care of four children and everything , and cook , and wash clothes and everything , with only a part-time girl to help , and then  --  " " Go to bed , Poppy , " he cut her off abruptly , without emotion . " Just go to bed . I 've got to go out . " " Cass Kinsolving ! You 'll do nothing of the  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was that of a father with a headstrong child , not unkindly but very firm . " Go the hell to bed . " Her face blazed up and she tossed her head , but she gathered her kimono about her and swept in insult toward the door . " You just go to the dickens ! " she said , with a catch in her voice , as she sashayed out , lyric and lovely and impossible . " Sometimes I think you 're absolutely pazzo in the head ! "  | " That 's two tonight who 've pegged me for a loony  --  two besidesmyself , " he said morosely when she had gone . I watched him as he sat there in gloomy silence , staring down into the dregs of his coffee . I did n't see how he would he able to go on . Yet again I sensed the urgent interior struggle : out of sheer power of will , right before my eyes , he seemed to be casting off the layers of drunkenness and obfuscation that encompassed him , much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who by successiveviolent shakes becomes purified and cleansed . It was as if he were actually thrashing about . Something held him in torment and in great and desperate need : I never saw anyone I wanted so to get sober . All at once he rose to his feet . " Now you 've got to be my will power , boy , " he muttered . " Come on . " I followed him down the steps into the dank darkness of the lower level of the house , puzzledby what he had just said , until he explained that he had to take a cold shower  --  in order to complete the process of purgation  --  butthat he lacked the strength of character , at this point , to keep from turning the hot water on . He snapped on a light in the noxious bathroom , where more diapers lay in soggy disarray upon the floor . " Me , I 've gotten used to it , " he said with a note of apology as he undressed . " I come in here and shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelling the pungent fern and the trailing arbutus . Now  --  " he exclaimed , climbing over the rim of the tub and standing rigidly with closed eyes beneath the shower . He thrust out his arm toward me . " Here , hold me glasses . Let her rip . " I turned on the cold water , frigid from mountain streams , full blast . He let out a yell . " That 's it ! " he cried as the water splashed and cascaded over him . He shivered and trembled and held his breath , groaning , his lips working as if in prayer . " That 's it ! Keep it up ! Mother of Christ ! . . . I 'm a bleeding Spartan ! . . . Keep it up , Leverett ! . . . Sacramento ! . . . I 'm turning into a . . . bleeding stalagmite ! " He howled and screamed there for five minutes beneath the driving spray but after a final whoop , like some crazed mystic announcing divine revelation , gasped that he was Methodist-sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face clambered dripping from the tub . " Well , " he said , stamping around with his eyes closed . " Now I can get down to business . " He groped for a towel , but there was none to be had , so he slapped off the water and slithered wetly into his pants . As he dressed he kept up a steady monologue . " No , that 's a lie , " he said while hopping around on one foot , try/ing without sitting down to put on a shoe , " I 'm not that sober . But I 'm sober enough to commit this  --  this most necessary larceny . Larceny ! You know , I have n't stolen anything since the war . I was on this island and I swiped a gallon and a half of grain alcoholfrom sick bay and I never got over being guilty about it . What a party we threw , though . What a marvelous party ! WheneverI think of that party it plain long eradicates all my sense of sin . Sitting down there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moon , downing all that booze . Triple bleeding God ! Did you ever drink grain alcohol ? You know , you can hardly taste it . And my God , what a thirst I had ! Now hand me that comb , will you ? " He began to comb his hair at the mirror ; his eyes were brighter , his hands steady now . He seemed to be finally in some command of himself , capable of most anything . " A proper thief 's got to be well groomed . Whoever heard of a second-story man who was n't the nattiest thing around ? Besides , this is going to be the cleanest wholesome-like little piece of burglaryyou ever heard about . No grubby old automobile tires or greasy money from a cash register or common degrading articles of merchandise  --  cigarettes or cameras or fountain pens or anything like that . My God , no ! This is going to be special . But look ! " he exclaimed , staring down at his feet . " I ca n't wear these clodhoppers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know  --  above all  --  has to be quietly accoutered around his foots . Else he 'll bump up against a prie-dieu or a taboret or a trundle bed or something , or set the joists and beams snapping with his clumsiness , and the whole household in their nightshirts will be down on him like a bunch of hawks . No , my friend . He 's got to be shod like a bleeding elf . " And , taking off his shoes , he padded across the darkened hallway , where , in a cluttered wardrobe or trunk , I heard him rummaging about , breathing heavily . After a moment he came padding softly back , wearing a pair of sneakers . His expression was tense and solemn . " It suddenly occurred to me , " he said , " in my great self-preoccupation , that I might be boring you out of your head . I 'm sorry , Level-eft . I have n't meant to . Please just say kiss my ass , and get out of here , if you want to . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you . I  --  I do n't know . It was very decent of you to  --  to intercede for me up there . " " Mason 's a swine ! " I blurted . " Tell me , Cass , did you  --  " He cut me off with a bitter , ugly look . " Do n't talk about it , " he said . " Just do n't talk about it , please . I 'm going to do a little burglarizing , that 's all , and I do n't want to forget myself and foul up.  |p203Look   --  " he said after a pause , " look , as plastered and fried and piggish as I 've been today , there are a few cracks of light 1 remember . One was you , down on the road this afternoon . I do n't know why , but I have the feeling I insulted you . I 'm sorry if I did , and I 'd like to apologize . I guess I thought you were another one of Mason 's tiresome shitheads  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in . " I was beat , and you were , well  --  " " Boiled . Anyway , that 's beside the point . What I 'm getting at is this : that somehow through all the evil red haze I remember beating your ears off about Tramonti  --  this little town back in the valley . I did n't mean to be trying to give you a message or anything . I only meant  --  " He turned away and moved slowly down the hall . " You 've been a fine guy , Leverett , and I hope I see some more of you . Soon as I relieve Mason of one of his treasures I 'm going to light out down into the valley . It 's quite a place to see , even at night , this place I 'm going . If you want to hang around , I 'll be back in fifteen minutes . " He disappeared without another word into the shadows , where I heard his feet sneak away , soft and stealthy as they climbed the stairs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Night-dwelling flies bumbled and buzzed in the stillness . It was a sad place I beheld , this room : chaotic , unkempt , stinking , it reminded me of nothing more than some of the living rooms I had seen at home during the weary thirties , when poverty was more than a lack of money and seemed to display itself , as in this room , by a simple bedragglement of spirit . A cheap plaster Madonna ogled me from the wall with dreamy , credulous eyes ; nearby a calendar marking the days of all the saints advertised the blood-red word Marzo , the month already half a year gone . A sardine can lay open on the table , filled with chartreuse-yellow grease . On an artist 's sketch pad flung out beside it were these words , with a pen frantically gouged , as if in splinters , and in a crazy , drunken scrawl : I hold to my Dear ones and now should I die I were not wholly wretched since ye have come to me Press close to me on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaming so Forlorn so grievous ! ! ! The pen had been laid aside after the first words of another phrase , unintelligible , below it  --  thrust aside with its nib punched in one violent jab through the paper , as if in sudden fury . Beneath all of this there was an impossible jerry-built child 's house with a chimney , in red crayon , a flight of prehistoric-looking birds , a spindly horse with ears like inanrp204moth swollen carrots , also in red crayon , and the notation below in enormous red letters : AMdRiCA GO*HOME ! ! MARGARET KiNSOLViNG AGE 8 POO . I thought I heard a mouse or rat stir in a far corner of the room , and I looked up with a start ; then with a shiver , feeling as if the decrepitude and inanition of the room had stolen into my very bones , I moved out onto the balcony . The starry lights on the water had not moved or altered , resting upon the sea like some untroubled constellation in the serene dark reaches of the firmament . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool lay blue and trembling , abandonedof all save the incessant crowd of moths which like windblownpetals fluttered and danced around the garish floodlamps . I hold to my Dear ones and now should I die . . . I could not get rid of the chill I felt in my heart and bones . I was touched all over by a clammy , insubstantial dread ; if I had been a woman , I think I might have had trouble suppressing a scream . The door slammed open behind me , turning my flesh , momentarily , to jelly . I wheeled around , beholding Cass , who in a great flurry and agitation went to a mountainous pile of junk in the corner of the room and began to rummage about , pitching socks and shoes and belts into the air behind him . " Where 's that miserable sack ? " he said . " It was as easy as pie , Leverett ! I could have walked in there in chain mail , rattling like a bagful of clamshells . The Hollywood riffraff were still whooping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please and copped it . It was like hooking candy . " " Copped what ? " I said . He did n't seem to notice . " Funny thing , " he went on . " Some big oaf of a Roman movie type met me just as I was coming out the bathroom with the goods in my hand . I never saw him before andhe knew I was up to no good . He just stood there with his big x lower lip drooping and said , Che vuole lei ? ' And , says I , thinking rapidly , Up yours , gorgeous , I work here , ' in my best English , and breezed on past him beaming like a friar . It takes a lot of brass and cunning to be a proper thief . " " What goods ? " I demanded . " Oh , " he said , looking up casually . " I quite forgot . Thoughtlessof me . This . " As I approached he held out a bottle , and when I bent down to peer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : PARA-AMINO SALICYLIC ACID LEDERLEU.S.A . The bottle glowed opulently in the dull light . " Pure magic , " he said , softly now and rather wryly . " A hundred capsules.  |p205Enough  to cure half a dozen romantic poets . What they do , they use it along with this streptomycin to cure T.B . Now if we 'd had this back in the thirties my dear old cousin Eunice Kinsolving would still be alive and kicking up in Colfax , Virginia . " " Where did Mason get it ? " I asked . " Ah now , " he said evasively , " he brought it forth from the clear and shining air . " " But  --  " I persisted , " but just what would he want with a hundred capsules of that stuff ? " " Ha ! " he said , without much humor . " Well , that 's quite a long story . That there is a story , my boy , that would make your toes curl up . " " But he could n't have gotten it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Why , man , I thought you knew Mason . Did n't you know that when it comes to worldly goods that boy can get anything ? Anything ! " He paused , regarding the bottle soberly . " The point is that you do n't hardly see any of this stuff in this benighted country . Oh , it 's here , all right . They 've gotten around to making it , just like in the good old U.S. and A. But try to get your hands on any of it . Why , for the price of this bottle you could ransom a whole clutch of Christian-Democrat senators . " " What are you going to do with it ? " For a long moment he was silent . " I do n't know , " he said , in a voice that was like a small cry . " Jesus Christ , I do n't know ! The doctor  --  Caltroni  --  this misery of a Sambuco doctor . . . To hell with that ! Anyway , it 's supposed to work all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too late in this case , but there 's an outside chance . But why in God 's name are we standing here talking like this ! Come on , let 's go . " Into a dirty knapsack he dropped the bottle , along with several cans of sardines , half a loaf of bread , and three or four bruised apples long past their prime . Then together we plunged out into the night . The main street of Sambuco up which we hastened was hardly a street at all , but a series of cobblestone steps too narrow and too steep for vehicles of any kind , damp with the steady seepage of water , slippery from this damp and from the smoothing wear of the centuries . As we toiled upward , panting , barely speaking , silent slumbering houses lined our route , illuminated by dim street lights for perhaps a mile or so , and then by nothing as the town itselfdropped behind and we found ourselves walled around by darkness . It suddenly smelled like country . Cass turned a flashlighton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , play/ing the light over a weedy patch of ground . " That 's it , " he murmuredsuddenly . " Come on . It 's a good half-hour 's hike , but it 's along the rim of the valley , and pretty level all the way , so we wo n't get too pooped . " His light caught a lizard in its beam  --  a ghost-eyed , anxious-looking little creature which fled our approachand scuttled away over a wall . " A million years old , the poor bastard , " Cass said . " Come on . " We set out down the trail . A smell of lemon trees blossomed in my nostrils . I do n't know what it was  --  perhaps only escaping at last that palace-hemmed chicanery  --  but the night seemed suddenly touched with rapture . An odor of clean earth , of lemon blossoms , of pine-scented air from the mountains came over us . Out from the edge of a roving cloud the pale full moon appeared , outlining the woods and slopes below , and a stream way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madly babbling and gurgling . I heard sheep baa-ing far off . The valley seemed enchanted . As we walked along Cass turned out his light ; we could see by the moon : its light engulfedthe entire valley , showering silver upon the pine groves and rocks and the peasants ' huts scattered here and there upon the slopes , looking lonely and marooned and asleep . Far up on the heights a waterfall noisily splashed : around it a rainbow quivered , then vanished . Again I heard the distant bleating of sheep , a somnolent , gentle noise . Finally Cass spoke up : " It 's like some crazy Arcadia , is n't it ? You should see it in the daytime , or at dawn . " There was a pause . " What 's your dodge , Leverett ? " " What do you mean , what 's my dodge ? " " Do n't get me wrong . I mean , what do you do ? To make the world go round , and the gardens grow and all that . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been doing , in Rome  --  there was another long pause . " I remember now , " he said . " Mason told me . " He paused . " Seems like you boys could have spread some of that aid or assistance or whatever you call it down here . " He stumbled against a stone , clutched at my arm for support , righted himself . " ' Scuse me , " he said , " still a little wobblyaround the ankle bones . " " I was n't the boss up there , " I began mildly to protest , trudgingalong beside him . " I was just an expediter , a what you call  --  " " Aha ! " he broke out in a hoarse , unhappy laugh . He pulled aberet out of his hip pocket , yanking it down rakishly over hisbrow ; it was an odd , brisk gesture , full of scorn and anger . " Ha ! Yes , Jesus Christ , I know you were n't the boss , God bless you . Isee the boss ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatp207shark-faced elder of the Presbyterian church . What does he know about the world , I ask you ! What do any of them know , the sleek stuffed bastards ! Why do n't they come back here and take a look ? " He paused , breathing hard . The valley around us swam in tender , silvery loveliness beneath the moon . " Look at it ! " he said , stretchingforth his arm . " It breaks your heart , does n't it ? And I 'll swear before God , Leverett , it 's the saddest place I know on earth . " Without altering his stride , Cass lit a cigar . Smoke billowed back around us in reeking gusts . Then , after another brief spell of hackingand coughing , he spoke to me over his shoulder . " Tell you a funny story about this valley . Very , very funny story . Around Sambuco it breaks everybody up when they hear it . Especially the fat Christian-Democrats who run the town . It really breaks them up . Now you know , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm but the land 's been so poor for so many years that they 're lucky to turn up a few dry peas in the spring . You should see the chickens ! They got a whole little fable about that . About how the valley of Tramonti 's the only place in Italy without foxes , the foxes got so disgusted years ago about the chickens that they just packed up and left . Anyway , that 's not the funny story . The story is about milk . You should see the cows , Leverett . They do n't get any fodder , of course ; they graze on the hillsides and they 're about the size of goats . Well , about five years ago , so the story goes , the governmentsent a bunch of agriculture inspectors around the province , testing samples of milk . Big deal , you know . They had a fancy sort of portable laboratory and all that , in a big truck and so on , and anyway , they came to Sambuco . Well , all the farmers from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk to be tested , for tuberculosis and fat content and mineral content and all that sort of thing . They tested this milk all day there in the square , and finally the farmers from this here valley  --  hell , there could n't be more than a dozen or so of them  --  these Tramonti farmers came up with their samples to be tested . Well , they took this Tramonti milk into their big portable laboratory and tested it and sampled it , and finally after a long time the head technician stepped out with the results . I can just visualize the whole scene : this big fat slob of a government man from Salerno with his test tubes and his charts and so on , and these poor sad hopeful yokels gawking up at him from the piazza . Well , the man drew a big breath finally and said , Questo qui non e latte . E un'altra coca . ' Ca n't you see it , the whole ridiculous scene : these poor draggledyassedbastards gazing up at this pompous fat chemist fellow , whilep208he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever it was , was certainly not milk . This is not milk , ' he said again , I guess in that pompous voice government officials have , it is something else . ' And then , very pompously , while all the Sambuco citizens gawked and snickered , he proceeded to give a chemical analysis of the Tramonti whatever-it-was : water , rat turds , hair , and a certain blue coloration which could only be made out as something really negative and horrible  --  a total absence of fat or minerals or any bleeding food value whatsoever . And then he said : Take it home , this stuff . It is not milk . ' " After a pause , Cass said : " Very funny story . Every time I hear it , it breaks me up . " His voice was spiritless . " Very funny , " he repeated . Sending out clouds of smoke from a corner of his grim , clamped lips , he fell into an impenetrable silence . We had walked for nearly half an hour when , trudging up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon-silvered shape of a peasant 's hut . We took a side path toward it , passing through a meadow busy with the scratching of insects , across a brook , beneath a shadow-haunted cypress grove , over a rickety stile . Descendingonto a patch of soggy , spongy ground , we found ourselves in a farmyard . There was a smell of manure in the air , and the rustle and stir , somewhere in the shadows , of chickens in clumsy slumber . A broken-down dog approached snarling and snapping , quieted down at Cass ' murmured tones , gave a whimper of delightand scrambled about us , his ribs stark and scurvy in the moonlight . We approached the hut across a stretch of parched earth . Inside the hut , what seemed to be a single dim lamp was glowing . And as we moved closer to the place , I was aware for the first time of a sound which broke in upon the serene moonlit quiet of the valley like fingernails against a pane of glass or the scream of braking wheels  --  not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one long , long protracted steady wail of anguish and despair which , emanating from the darkness of the hut , was like a laceration upon my eardrum . " My God , " I said . " What 's that ? " Cass said nothing . The wail in the hut ceased abruptly , as if strangled , and after a few seconds there came in its stead a low series of groans , almost inaudible now , but touched with the same insupportable and desolating anguish . Nearer , we could hear a scuffling of feet within ; a child cried , a pot or pan fell , then all was silent as before . " Chi e la ? " came a voice from the shadows . It was a woman'sp209voice , oddly heavy and masculine , and slow and torpid , suffused throughout with the deepest weariness . " Sono io , Ghita , " said Cass softly . " It 's just me , Ghita  --  Cass . With a friend . " The woman stood in the doorway , her arm upthrust against the frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floodingmoonlight . It was an awesome face  --  fearsome , I should say , in the attitude graven upon it of suffering . Her lips were contorted downward , her eyes had become as dull and as sightless as two black stones ; like wild grass her hair flew out around her head in unkempt strands . And she stood there motionless except for her breathing , which heaved up the sagging breasts beneath her tattered bag of a dress , and seemed to shake her all over . She looked like one whose grief had borne her miles beyond the realm of simple tears . " Buonase ' , " she said in a dull voice . " We were waiting for you . " " How is Michele ? How is he tonight ? " " He fails , " she said . " He asks for you . It 's his pain now . It 's as if his pain were my pain , so that when he cries out I can feel it in my own bones . I think he will die soon . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The morphine ? Shut up about dying . " " It 's of no use now . He no longer feels it . Besides , the glass instrument one uses fell and broke . La siringa . Alessandro took it in his hands  --  " " I told you to keep  --  " Cass began with a note of anger . Then he said quietly : " Ah well , we 'll arrange to get another . " Her voice was parched and dry . " I feel it in my bones , " she said , " in my flesh . Here . Everywhere . Maddalena came tonight . She says that the disease possesses me now . The children . That it will devour us all . She gave me a philter  --  " " Keep that witch out of here , " Cass interrupted . The groans commenced again from the recesses of the hut . The woman stiffened and her eyes grew wide . " Keep that witch away from here , Ghita . How many times have I told you to have done with these idiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep her out of here . Poison ! Has n't Francesca told you , too ? Where is Francesca ? " The woman made no response , turning toward the sounds like an automaton and melting into the shadows of the hut . The groans faded , and suddenly died . " What it is , " Cass said to me as he removed the knapsack from his shoulder , " is a case of miliary tuber/culosis . Galloping consumption . This man 's riddled with the stuff from head to toe , bones and kidneys , liver , lungs , and lights . Broke his leg a while back , which do n't help any . It hurts him , and it 's like a bleeding sponge . There 's not a hope in the world . I would n't go inside if I were you . " He weaved a bit , as if still halfdrunk , but steadied himself . He took the bottle of capsules from the sack , peering at it closely in the moonlight . " As for me , if I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God ! A bleeding amateur sawbones ! Now what the hell did the book say ? What 's the dose ? Oh yes , three grams four times a day . Well , we 'll see . It sure wo n't hurt this poor bugger . Nothing in this world . " He turned and made a move toward the door . " There 's no point in your taking a chance . I wo n't be very long . " " I guess I 'll go on in with you , " I said . " Suit yourself , " he replied . The stench of the place met me at the door , clamping itself down over my face like a foul green hand . It was an odor of many things  --  of manure again , of sourness , of dirt and offal  --  but mainly it was the odor of disease , a sweet tainted odor as of meat gone bad which blossomed in the air as vividly as a color . It was the odor of the morgue . Fumbling my way in the smirchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated a steady buzzing in the stillness : they were everywhere  --  in the air , on the earthen floor , and upon each inch of the windowless walls . In sticky nocturnal fidget they crawled across the wan faces of three feverish , sick-looking childrenwho , oblivious to the stir around them , and to the racking wails , slept soundly in one corner on a tick of straw . Nothing adorned the walls , not even a Madonna , while for furniture there was a table and three chairs and that was all . A huge shadow stirred clumsily in a nether corner of the room , startling me , until I saw that it was a cow , separated from the room by a low wooden partition , who gazed up at me from her repose with a sweet funerealexpression , all the while sedately masticating . Then another groan roused me , and I saw the sick man on his straw pallet , only his face exposed beneath a thin and tattered U. S. Army blanket , the face itself taut , immobile , as pale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunken and ravaged flesh , that I thought for an instant that he must be dead . Cass and the woman had knelt down beside him . I heard Cass ' voice , soft and gentle : " Come va , mio caro ? Soffri molto ? It 's me , Cass , Michele . " Michele opened his eyes , and slowly looked around him . It was as if he had been in some rapt communion with his agony , a **28;1754;TOOLONG for cameramen . Crossrows ' has to do with inserted film-clips , but we do n't employ them . " " How did you learn about them ? " " I spent tedious hours around the studios . Also I read up when I first came on the job . The technical side of our program is very special , and not very difficult . In fact , the whole idea is kind of special . " " What is the idea ? " asked Hondorp . " A kind of Miss Lonelyhearts is n't it ? Little views of people 's problems seen by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly , then thought a moment , and said it again . " No , it 's somewhat more abstract than that . Golk does n't really feel for people . You 'll see . Every once in a while he comes up with a new brand of golk and then he talks about it . You can take or leave what he says , but it 's not a bit like Miss Lonelyhearts . I think I 've seen him really sympathetic toward the victim only once or twice in the two-and-a-half years I 've been around . " The waiter put before Hondorp a plate of cracked ice into which ten or twelve shells stuffed with little fatty objectswere stuck , and at his recoil , said , " You did order moules , did n't you sir ? " " I did , " said Hondorp . He extracted one of the mollusks with the silver tines of a utensil he 'd never before used , put it into his mouth and winced again . " Oh God , " he thought . " Is it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun too long your first day at the shore , " said Hendricks , and Hondorp stared , wondering if he 'd actually said what he 'd thought . " You 'll get used to it in a few days . " " Maybe I move my lips , " thought Hondorp , " and these Golk-types get some kind of training reading them . "  |p45Hendricks  reached for one of his shells and sucked out the mussel . " I 'm a food-moocher , " she said in what Hondorpspotted with happiness as her first concession to a style to which he could feel superior . He managed a facial twist of benign distaste . Its success  --  Hendricks responded in kind  --  somewhat restored his confidence . " You know , " he said , deciding to do the leading , " I really have seen you before . And not just passing by in the street , although I might have remembered you even then . You are different from people one passes in the street . " " If not , " she said seriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That makes you sound like a lot of others . " " I do n't mind sounding like them , just being like them . " " Well , where have I seen you ? " " I 've been on the program a few times . I 'm not much of a performer , but he uses me for class golks . And then I started as you did , a victim . In Delman 's . I was buying shoes . Golk was the salesman . He kept bringing the wrong size and trying to cram me into them . I was just about to kick his teeth out . He stopped just in time . " The last came out with a kind of bemused nostalgia . " I saw it . I 'm sure . I remember it . Mostly your face . " " Do n't tell that to Golk . " " Why not ? Does n't he want to make the amateur , the man in the street memorable ? " " I told you you 'll have to let him tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much care . And anyway , Golk did n't make me memorable , I made one of his golks memorable , and that I do n't think he wants . And do n't compliment me ; it sticks in my gut . Just relax . "  |p46Hondor|p  shoved the mussels across the table . " All right . Fine . I get you . " Hendricks put her hand on his . " Look , " she said with weary urgency . " Be forgiving . I 've got temperament up to here , " and she raised her hand to her throat and then dropped it back on his . " And let 's shake Golk for a while . When you come down to Parisak-land five or six days a week , you begin to feel him around your neck like the albatross . It 's too much . " Hondorp thought of his father at the barometer . " I suppose that 's the way it is with jobs , " he said half to himself . She shook her head . " I think not , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's this job . " " So what 'll we do ? " asked Hondorp , shifting gear . The question hung in the air for a moment before Hendricksreluctantly took it out . " There 's not a damn thing to do in this city . " " I wonder , " he said , smiling secretively and blushing a little . " I confess to having spent quite a few happy hours here . " " Doing what ? The ball games ? Movies ? Shubert Alley ? Carnegie Hall ? The galleries ? Shopping ? Forest Hills ? Blind Brook ? The ferry ? It 's like a permanent World 's Fair . Without the excitement of a temporary one . It 's not a place . A place is somewhere you can manage . Where the variety is natural , not a series of spectaculars . " " I have n't traveled , " said Hondorp . " New York is most of what I know . " She stared at him as if he were suffering a stroke . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're actuallylucky . Would the devils have minded hell if they 'd never known anything else ? "  |p47For  the third time on the terrace , Hondorp had the sense of vista . This time there was n't even an object to attach to it , nor did he possess any co-ordinates to locate it . Since he could n't now credit what she 'd said , he decided to discredit what she was . " You 're attitudinizing again . Like a bored jeune fine in Stendhal or the twenties . " " I 'm not a reader , " she said harshly . " Do n't confuse me with your tenth-rate little women . " Hondorp , feeling his hook catch flesh , smiled coldly , and said that he 'd never do that . The meal finished out in a trance . " Let 's go , " she said , putting the apple core in his unfinishedcoffee cup . " We 're due to go on a golk at two-thirty . " " I 'm sorry about the jeune fine . " " Not at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read . Things are looking up now anyway . That 's the strange thing : no matter how dull something is , it becomes tolerable when you golk it . " The headwaiter held the door for them . " Good-by , Mrs. Hendricks , " he said , nodding fraternally to Hondorp . For Hendricks , Hondorp constituted a diversion from a routine which , as she 'd indicated to him , had come to smother her , and smother her in a fashion which made it nearly impossible for her to do anything about it , for even at its worst , it was incomparably more engaging than anything she 'd ever done , indeed , anything she could now con/ceive of doing . And Hendricks had done a great deal , for although working for Golk was the only paid job she 'd ever held , she 'd come to it near the end of a long , brutal path . She was the only child of two free-wheeling explosives of the jazz age , two conscious rioters who 'd spent eight years assaulting each other with surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Hendricks ' mother delivered what turned out to be her final surprise , a baby whom she bore in a drunken haze and which helped kill her in the delivery room . At the funeral , Hendricks ' father made drunken advances to an uncle 's new wife , and this earned him a gaudy paragraph in two of the leading gossip columns  --  now beginning to enjoy the powers of their spectacular malice on a national scale  --  and caused his monumentally indifferent family to take first notice and then steps . His mother , herself a savage , riotous dowager , who 'd more or less retired from active combat with the Depression , took the infant to a winterized summer home in Watch Hill and let her grow up there under the barest tutelage of a foggy Irish couple until she was ready for boarding school . These fourteenmarine years were , withal their increasing longueurs , the best Hendricks was to know . At fifteen , she ran away from Miss Dobbs , running a Kotex pad up the flagpole as a mark of farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any girl who 'd ever suffered Miss Dobbs ' tutelage , and was consequently the feared idol of her contemporaries . The confidence this gave her failed at a matinee of Carousel , her second day on the loose ; she gave herself meekly up to authority and was dispatchedabroad to a boarding school at Vevey , the theory being that she could exercise less influence over foreigners and might therefore be subject to some.  |p49She  was . Her guide was a precocious Belgian lesbian , her roommate , a girl whose sexual hatred of men had turned philosophic and so helped forge independence . From her , or with her , Hendricks learned that she had a mind as well as a will , an open future rather than a timetable . Hendricks  --  then her name was Willoughby , Jeanine Willoughby  --  indulged the Belgian 's raptures and received in turn the credo . She accepted all but the sexual article , and made her plans accordingly . It took her two years to get out of the school , years in which her chief pleasure was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared her for more of the world than she would ever use . ( And Hondorp had been right about Stendhal ; she had found a prototype in Lamiel . ) At seventeen , she telegraphed her father that the school was a lesbian brothel and asked for money to travel with " the family of a fellow-sufferer . " She gave the purported sufferer'ssurname as that of the American Ambassador to Belgiumafter determining from her roommate that the Ambassadorboth had a family and one that was not likely to be known by anyone in her own . This precaution was taken more for her grandmother than her father . By the time the old woman learned the truth , Mr. Willoughby had opened an account for Jeanine in Zurich and written the school to release her . She divided the account among six European banks and was off to Paris ; if they were going to try and stop her , they were going to have a time of it . She was n't stopped , and after a fruitless week , her grandmother stopped trying to stop her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonforms of unattached indulgence , the difference in Jeanine 's case being that she was never at their mercy . Shep50rationed her body as she did her money , and passed it out only for her own pleasure or to gain some other , limited end . She went through Europe assiduously , almost studiously , appraising her experience and discarding it after appraisal . This from her seventeenth to her nineteenth year . One afternoon at the Hotel Druot she had caught fire at three square inches of Goya etching and bid a quarter of a million francs which she did n't have for it . There had been a scene in the office during which Hendricks had exercised every seductive strategy she 'd mastered in the last two years with absolutely no visible effect on the sleek official whose eye went over her as if she were a shabby , unsellable objet d'art . It was not the first time that her eight thousand dollars a year had seemed to her little more than a trap for her desires , enough money to let her view pleasures she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to her only the most ordinary or most bizarre . For a few months she tried speculating on the Bourse and then , via her father , in the commodity markets . The gambit forced her to touch capital . Then she bought a surplus army plane , sold it for a small paint factory in Meudon-Val-Fleury , and sold that for a shipment of Italian typewriters which were hijacked outside of Vicenza . After this collapse , she decided to marry , to marry money , and Immanuel Kant 's glacial definition of marriage became her guide , her image of the woman-crippling condition . Marriage to money meant a return to the United States : European wealth was too remote and the techniques of entrapmenttoo involved for a single girl . no matter how beyliste . So she came back , first to Watch Hill , then to New York where she made a swift and useless pass at a debut , moved on to Sea Island , Prout 's Neck , Newport , Hobep51Sound , Pasadena , the West Indies , and then , her gorge stuffed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met George Hendricks at a party in the Longchamps enclosure , and married him . Her life later seemed to her to have been but preparation for this terrible error . George Hendricks was the son of a Soho whore and a Manchesterassurance man . He was also the son-in-law of LaomedonDemicapoulos , one of the great Hellenic freebooters who had swept up the usable debris of the Second World War and emerged as not only a billionaire but almost as an independent nation . Hendricks was a brilliant time-server , an accounting wizard with a flare for violence . By the time he married Demicapoulos ' daughter , he had three million dollars of his own and controlled eighty times that amount . Six years later he was said to be worth sixty million . Prying him free from the Greek 's only daughter was for Jeanine a labor that seemed to her worthy of her training . When it was all over , it turned out that her machinations and chicanery were the objects of her husband 's and his first wife 's entertainment . Neither of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage . Jeanine 's difficulties and strategems provided them with the only really pleasurable fruit of it . Jeanine 's marriage was her rack . Hendricks ' contempt and detestation were unbounded in extent and savagery , and she was for him little more than a laboratory in which he experimented with the odder aspects of his passions . He moved systematically to grind down every gesture of the independence whose existence represented the creative act of Jeanine 's life . Far beyond her in strength and shrewdness , his typical strategy was to rouse an argument , and lead it on and on until he 'd led her to see herself self-contradicted , ex/posed , ridiculous . He baited her to rage , and fed it until it became violence ; then he counterpunched her attacks , knocked her groggy , threw her into bed or on the floor , and then , often as not , assaulted her . It went on like this nine months . She had held on thinkingthat sheer holding on would break him . When she 'd made better gauge of his tenacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old roommate took her in and introducedher to a narcotic bliss which saved her sanity . For fifteen months she lived in haze . She came to one day after a fall down the stone steps in the Jardins Royales , came to to find herself prominent and bloody . That very night , bandaged and aching , she lit out for Bad Gasteinshe'dbeen reading a book on mad King Ludwig  --  and there she locked herself in a hotel room and fought the cramping pains of privation . " My labor pains , " she said , gripping the headboard , huddling under quilts , ripping the sheets , " and I come out my own child . " And she did , feeble , tearful , uncoordinated , then took the Kur and came slowly back to strength and self-control . She sailed to America , went out to Nevada and sued Hendricksfor divorce . In return for its being uncontested  --  and she well knew what a contest there could have been with him , even in Nevada  --  she received nothing from him but  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Travel and Diner 's Club Card , a two-thousand-dollar insurance policy on his life taken out especially for the occasion , and a letter entitling her to distinguished considerationfrom all agents of the Demicapoulos concerns . She acceptedthese along with the divorce and went back to New York , took a room at the Ambassador and began to look for a way to come all the way to life.  |p53She  was twenty-two , and on the edge of change , either of something outside the world of what she thought of as " experience for its own sake " or , if necessary , of that politic femalesubmission she had long ago fought to a standstill . And then , two months after her return , while she was in Delman 's buying shoes , she was golked . When the salesman pulled the red beard off his chin , Hendricks burst into a laughter to which her vocal cords were so unused that they ached for minutes after , and when half an hour later in the Sherry Netherlands Bar , Golk invitedher to join his crew , she laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more relief than amusement in it . That night they went out to dinner , and by that time she had accepted more than the original invitation . The other invitation was hedged by commentary . " I 'm either incapable of or powerfully unwilling to enter a long , drawn-out relationship , " Golk said in the elaborate , deadly manner which was the one he employed for extra-studio situations . He said it as they ate dessert , and showed her with half-smile and open hand that for him the importance of such a relationship could be measured by that brief , sweet course . Then , as was his custom also , he said what he had just been at pains to explain without saying , namely that in this respect he was continental . " And , " he went on , " as with Europeans , dessert is not the end of my meals . " If the invitation was hedged , it was n't brutal , and for Hendricks , that meant a great deal . " I 've always thought , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the amazing return on a forgotten sweepstakes ticket , " that the basis for the whole thing was  --  is  --  part of legitimate curiosity , for the wisdom that nothing else sup/plies . It 's got nothing to do with experience , and nothing serious to do with natural urges . Good men have lived withoutit . If I do n't pick up something besides a quick boot or a whiff of hashish every time , it 's as if I have n't done it . " Hendricks , to whom the countless variations of the countlessapproaches to this imperial city were rutted with familiarity , found this hodgepodge somehow touching . He went on . " When love gets to be important to someone , it means that he has n't been able to manage something else . Falling in love seems to me an almost sure sign of failure . Except for the very few who have a real talent for it . I grant that . Of course , it 's a minor talent . Though that may be too hasty . Who 's to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm minor . In fact , I 'm nowhere . " Golk 's notions about love did not , in Hendricks ' authoritativeview , drastically affect his practice . At least , he neither enlarged nor soured the range of her experience . She enjoyedbeing with him , making love or not , and she was with him too seldom to fall into that nauseating satiety everythingbrought her so much more quickly than she thought just . It was about the time when she began to look forward to evenings with him , suspensefully , even fearfully , that he abandoned her , called her but once a month and then usuallyat two or three o'clock on rainy mornings asking her to hoof it over to his apartment . She always did , happier in being the therapy for his cauchemars than in being anyone else 's daydream . The calls apparently came after he had n't been able to figure something or other out , a particular golk , or some notion he wanted to write out in his journal . He alwaystold her this as an apology for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time.  |p55When  Hondorp joined the golks , she had n't been called in five months , and her memory of the nocturnal pleasure reposed with most of her life in the oblivion she contrived for it . Oblivion had about undone all but one night with him , a night which escaped not because of its intrinsic pleasure , but because it puzzled her understanding of him . It had begun with an unusual golk , the victim of which was a Lower East Side Italian mother of eleven children who would not react to the frustrations which were to form the center of the scene , but instead took the rebuffs with a dignified , tolerant , intelligent humor which made the golk successful despite the lack of the dramatic center Golk was working for . Golk had played the part of an itinerant fruit and vegetable peddlerselling his goods at suspiciously low prices . Another victim , also Italian , raucous , expressive , a natural comic , had risen to the bait , let her suspicions grow until the fruit which would reveal no flaw to her rigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was-a too good . " The second woman Golk could not excite ; sudden shifts in the position of apples , looks of leering triumph as she made a purchase , lowering the price of refused items still more , offering to give them away , nothing shook the easy achievement of her mission . Failing here , Golk started talking to the woman about her family , baiting her gently about their number , her cooking , and then , suddenly , he was invited to dinner that night , and accepted . And he went , with Hendricks , Fitch , and the camera . It was a vinous , pasty orgy . Bowls of spaghetti darkened by islands of onion , spiced meat , and peppers were emptied within seconds of being put on the table . Bottles of raw , amber Brindisi gurgled down fifteen throats . Golk , at thep56table , hurled great gobs of food into his mouth , raced the others to refills , burped monstrously , looked glazed , talked a kind of pidgin Italian , and then flopped on a couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the camera grind on , " cranking it " only when he ran out of film . The next day , Klebba objected strenuously to the footage . " It 's pointless , " he said . " A bunch of lousy hogs . And you do n't seem planted there , " he said to Golk . " Just another hoggish wop . What 's the point ? " " We 'll use it , " Golk said . " Its one of the greatest golks I 've ever made . " And he had it shown again and would permit no cuts . It would be shown in two parts on the program . " Like Stroheim making Greed , " said Klebba . " Just put in every damn thing the camera can see . No quality , just footage . " Golk looked at it again . " An uncomic wopera , " was his description of it , and the phrase allayed all complaints from the golks . By the next night , they had persuaded him to cut it down to one full program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hendricks went out to dinner , and that night she told him the story of her marriage , the only part of her life that he had n't heard or asked her about . They walked up Fifth Avenue in the cold November night , and in the frosty light angling up from the pavements , Golk glowed blue like a Christmas tree bulb . Their furred arms  --  Golk wore a raccoon coat , Hendricks a mink  --  were linked at the elbows . " Once we were at Longchamps , " she began . " What 's that ? " He knew who " we " meant . " A race track in the Bois de Boulogne . In Paris . We werep57out there , and I was having what was for me a pretty good day , one winner across the board out of five races . In the sixth I had a hunch , a genuine hunch . You know , you feel chill on your skin . " " Yes . " " It was a filly named Zut Alors . I gave George all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him to bet it win and show . Occasionally he 'd do errands like that with a sort of blank coldness that was supposed to make you say , Never mind , I 'll do it myself . ' But I was used to him . Know what he did ? " Golk shook his head ; the question was just for taking sight on the outrage . " The horse belonged to some French banker . George did n't know him from Adam , but he went in to the clubhouse , found the fellow , and right then and there , sur le champ as they say , he bought the horse using my four hundredthousand as first payment . I think Demicapoulos had some hold on the guy . Or maybe not . George had great powers of persuasion . Anyway he went down with this fellow , got the jockey as he was mounting for the race , took him aside and told him to come in no better than fourth . Then he came back and told me what he 'd done . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , just the time between races . You know what he said ? " Golk shook his head . " He said , It 'll teach you the inadvisability of playing hunches . Only certain people can play hunches . Those who do n't have to . ' What do you think of that ? " Golk said nothing . " He used to hire cars to follow me when I was driving somewhere . I 'd be going out to Versailles , or just going to shop , and all of a sudden there 'd be a smack on my bumper.  |p58I  knew what was what . I 'd give it a run , but half the time this damn thing would be bumping me , just bumping me . I 'd try to maneuver where there 'd be a flit  --  " " A cop ? " " Yes . But he 'd have scooted . And then pick me up again . I gave up driving . " They had reached the Plaza and walked around to the Park side and gone into the Oak Bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who kept on talking even as Golk ordered , seemed a kind of fortune teller sitting in the dark , extravagant room with the snow mural , telling her past as if it were the dread future of an insensitive client . After another half hour 's worth of talk , she stopped , less because she 'd run out of brutalities than because she became more aware of Golk 's cool , unmoved study of them . Yet stopping , she felt the strangeness of his large , warm palm on her hand , felt it abstractly stroking , reassembling as it were what his eye was breaking down . His look had been like a wellshaftthrust into her body , and she had felt herself yielding what counted for her as she 'd never before yielded even to herself . Now , hand to hand , she felt not restoration of what she 'd yielded , but the peace of having made some sense out of what had been little more than pain , fury , unreason . After a while , he said , " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've never used it . If I were starving , I do n't know if I 'd use his lousy Diner 's Card . " " Let 's use it tonight , " he said . " All right , " she said easily . " I can even use that letter to old Demicapoulos . " " It 's to his agents , " she said . " And what do you think you can do with the goddamn thing ? "  | " There 's almost nothing in this world that I ca n't find a use for , " he said without smiling . " Yes , " she said , before suppressing any egoistic reference from the reply , " I 'm aware of that . I 'll bring you the letter . " " Let 's go , " he said , and he called the waiter , wrote down the Diner 's Card number and signed her name . They got their coats and went out the north exit into the cold wind blowing down Central Park South . They crossed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Golk took her head in his hands and , as if testing a new wine , delicately , knowledgeably kissed her . " Oh " she said , after this . " Oh , oh , oh . " " You know , " he said , " it 's a strange race that can claim you and that damn wop woman as parts of one species . " He took her arm and they walked back to his apartment , a long , cold walk which tired them only near the very end . They walked close together , the fur coats blending so they seemed the hide of one immense animal . It was the closest she had been to Golk , but the next day , coming to work  --  she had gone home to change in the meantime  --  shefound in him no mark of their intimacy . The night had taken what it had supplied . And there were no more such nights . Every clear day from the end of March to the beginning of December , the chess and checker players assembled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parks in a grassy enclosure in uptown Central Park , a few hundredp60yards west of the public tennis courts and somewhat farther north of a kiddies ' playground . The chess and checker playerswere almost entirely men over sixty-five , although there were a few younger men , petty rentiers or pensioned invalids , and an even fewer number of old women ; the latter showed up mostly on warmer days . The regulars were a coatand-tiecrowd ; informality was frowned upon unless there was medical justification for it , although in the winter , the unspoken rules permitted a great variety of hats , astrakhans , berets , caps of all sorts , winter Alpines , scarves of many colors , length , and texture , and heavy overcoats , usually battered and bearing the marks of ones which would not be replaced . In the warm months , along with the return of the women regulars , there were frequent stragglers , mostly fresh kids either to be ignored or bounced out by the Park Department'sattendant , tennis players coming back from the courts , or simply passers-by intrigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the long green tables . Occasionally stragglers found out that for a quarter the attendant would give them a board and men . ( The regulars paid two dollars a year for a license entitling them to unlimited use of the facilities . ) Sometimes seven or eight stragglers ' games went on at once which meant that a few regulars were temporarily displaced . Temporarily , because only the hardiest or dullest interlopers could withstand the expelling stares of the regulars . Stragglers were tolerated if they watched quietly  --  like the ten steady kibitzers of the group or if they filled in as the opponent of a regular temporarily without a game and acted as if they knew they were being granted a courtesy . Most of the regulars were chess players only ; the checker players were looked down upon , and occupied the periph/eral tables , a fragile shell around the kernal of the chess players . On a fine blue April day , the regulars were out in force . There was a stragglers ' game going on as well , one which was attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances from their own positions to the solution of the bizarre couple playing in the unfavorable northeast corner of the enclosure . The couple consisted of a short , well-dressed man wearing a black Homburg out of which sluiced effusions of red hair and a young Negress in a remarkably bulging black sheath . By her side was a large suitcase , which constituted for the regulars one of the major mysteries about the pair . " Could be she 's got no place to go , " said one of the most distinguished regulars , Frankl . His opponent , Heinemann , a little man who curved around himselflike a snarl of gray wool , depressed his head even farther than usual between his shoulders and then stretched the muscles of his lower jaw to complete the Eastern European shrug of " Could be . " It was not customary for stragglers ' games to attract even straggling kibitzers , but three strange men and a woman were watching this game . One of the men , dressed in workman'sclothes , was carrying an oddly protuberant lunch box which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick animal inside of it . " Maybe likes fresh meat for dinner , " was Frankl 's whispered explanation of this phenomenon . Heinemann supplied the shrug and then blinked with fright as he noticed the lunch box shift menacingly toward him . " A tommy-gun , " was his shattering , unexpressed notion . He sat paralyzed till the black muzzle moved away from him . The stragglers had come up separately , yet they seemedp62to cohere like a retinue . Occasionally they bent down to murmur something to the man , and once one of them bent toward the woman 's suitcase and actually touched it , althoughfor what purpose , no regular 's eyesight was good enough to determine . All of a sudden the woman cried out , " What do you think you 're doing with that knight , man ? " Every regular 's eye in the enclosure bent toward the outburst . The Homburg 's boisterous response was , " Get your cotton-pickinghands off that piece . " " What do you think there , man , that 's a rook and bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand pushing the piece one way while the Homburg pushed it another . " And if you want to try Indian wrestling , " she went on , " I 'll throw you halfway across the park . " " Sag ' ihm was , Julius , " whispered Heinemann to Frankl , his imagination opening onto a scene of violence which he knew would end his days there and then on the enclosure grounds . Frank , the man whose custom it was to say " shah mat , " " the king is dead , " instead of " checkmate , " whose scholarly authority was solicited for all refined judgments among the regulars , who had in private life , twenty-five years before , been a not-unsuccessful petty manufacturer of dress goods , Frank rose to the perils of the occasion , stood up and went over to the disputants . " May I be of some assistance ? " he asked in a voice which all of his authority could not keep unwavering . " Are you a chess player ? " asked the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call in question the necessity of old men . The response of the regulars to this inquiry was divided between a feverish incomprehension and suffocated hysteria . Above their mutters , Heinemann 's " Ha , ha , ha , " wavered like a blown flag . " I happen to be , " said Frankl with a modest dignity that stiffened the regulars with admiration . " Indeed , " he continued in a more expansive and natural manner , " some of my friends consider me an authority of sorts . " He took from an inside pocket a squat , dirty tome , Rehboch and the Viennese Middle Game , displayed it , and said , " You see , I am a reader as well as a participant . " " Excellent , " said the Homburg . " You said it , " came from the Sheath . " Now look here at this move he 's trying to make with his knight here . And you know what he tells me ? " " What ? " asked Frankl , watching with amazement as a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told her , " interrupted the Homburg , his eye flashing with what even Frankl could now see was mania , " that in the Goldsmith-Benjamino gambit , the knight has the option of doubling and reversing its move , something that I did not expect to have to tell anyone who has played , or claims to have played  --  " and here he fixed his grinding eye on his opponent 's face  --  " the royal game . " " Hm , " said Frankl , and he made a half-turn toward his expectant fellows . " You admit you 'd castled , do n't you ? " pursued the Homburg . " I brushed my teeth this morning too , " responded thegirl . " What 's that got to do with the price of baked beans ? " " Bravo , " muttered Heinemann . " An intelligent floozie. "  | " Quiet , " said Frankl , now bent over the board . After a minute of reflection , and a few seconds of inadequate attempts to straighten up , he came erect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Foul play . " " What 's that ? " demanded the Homburg , his eyes glittering . Frankl , clutching his book , braved the madness . " Listen , mister , " he said . " Since 1880 , sixty-five years almost , I 'm playing chess . In that time , in my entire career , playing , reading , talking , not one word have I heard about Goldsmith-Benjamino . One word ? Not one syllable . " He planted a tiny fist into a receptive little palm and turned to Heinemannfor verification and relief . " Unerhort , " said Heinemann quietly . " You see , mister , " said Frankl sweetly . " That 's my reason for saying Foul play . ' " The man in the Homburg wiped his head with a great handkerchief , looked around wildly at the accumulating circle of regulars , and said , " Is there no one here in this famous group of chess and checker players of whom all New York knows , is there no one here who can enlighten these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which my father learned directly from Goldsmithhimself ? " The inimical silence was broken into by a tiny old woman regular , Miss Morseburger , who came up to the Homburg , shook his hand , and said in a loud baritone , " I can enlighten . I 'm Morseburger . My brother , Jules Ferry Morseburger , for many years second board of the Respighi Club , employed the convention of which you speak not once , not twice , but innumerable and frequent times . "  |p65Heinemann  made a series of small circles with his hand , " Notorious , " he said . " Ganz verriickt . " " With all due respect , " said Frankl , his little white head dark with rebuke , " Miss Morseburger is I think confusing the alleged convention with an established one . I think our job here is ended . " He started to turn back but was halted by a scream . It was Miss Morseburger . " Look , " she cried , pointing to the man with the Homburg who was not only removing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoning an immense , hairless skull to the sun . " It 's that Golk , " shrieked Miss Morseburger . " There are two pivots to the golks we 're doing these days , " said Golk from the driver 's seat to Hondorp who sat with Fitch , Benson , and Elaine in the back of the station wagon . They were driving up to Central Park . " The hook in the worm is one . You dangle a prize before a victim , play him like a hooked carp , and while he watches , turn the prize to dust . " Hondorp , who had recently seen a smallish prize dangled before him and then turn to dust , was not offended by the awkwardness of the figure . " That 's how we played that old Whiskers yesterday with the Shakespeare . The other kind is the kind we played on you . Stepping in between a man and his legitimate pleasures . We thwart a man from the satisfaction of the appetites he 's entitled to . " " One is n't entitled to appetites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hondorp had discerned the note ofp66true style during lunch . She was sitting flank to flank with Golk in the front seat . " One has them . You talk about managingpeople . You ca n't even manage an English sentence . " Golk hesitated over her reprimand but did n't let it affect the instruction he was giving Hondorp . " Like a few weeks ago . We were golking in a Whelan 's up on Broadway . I was jerking sodas behind the counter . Klebba was a decoy customer . A guy would come in and order a sundae , say , and I 'd take a long time getting it to him , and when I did , it was a cherry frappe . There 'd be a fuss , and I 'd ask Klebba if the guy had n't ordered a cherry frappe . He 'd say , Yes , ' and we were off . A couple of them admitted they were wrong . Some little guy flung a glass of water at me . It was a very successful operation . Right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was the pivot . Now we 're going to work a variation of it . These whiskers up here play chess two hundred days a year , morning , noon , and night . The only thing that stops them is the undertaker . Well , we 're the undertakers today . Get it ? " " Yes , " said Hondorp . " I follow you . " " The principle is n't complicated . A principle better not be . But on camera , you 're on the highwire . Almost like live TV , though they 're always working from a script , or at such low tension it does n't matter , or from the news event which is mostly out of their hands , but you make a mistake on this show , and you 've ruined a good idea , an afternoon , and a lot of film . You do n't repeat golks . Like lightning . Get it ? " " Yes , " said Hondorp . " I get it . " In the rearview mirror , Hendricks studied Hondorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Hendricks , "  |p67he  had been a study in discomfort , one which she had had no thought of provoking , but which she relished . " A natural victim , " was her assessment of him , for within the limits of Hondorp 's impassivity , she could read the flickers of distress , pleasure , and now , as he listened to Golk 's lecture , melancholyboredom on his dark face . It was what she thought of as an " amateur 's face , " a map on which exploiters could trace with ease their devious routes . It was not her own ambition to exploit it . If anything , it was to harden the face , or rather , harden the man behind it so that the signs of pleasure and distress would be blurred into a worldly neutrality . This was , she felt , what lay in back of Golk 's injunction to " whip him into shape . " " It 's not just showing him the ropes . Golk wants something basic , " was her thought . They entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearing at Ninety-first . They parked and made preparations : Golk put on his wig and Homburg , Elaine a swash of lipstick and some junk jewelry , Fitch adjustedthe camera in the odd lunch box , and Benson manipulatedthe complex innards of the suitcase . " Elaine and I first , " said Golk . " Then Benson with the suitcase . Billy you wait five minutes with the camera , Hondorpyou five more , and Hendricks five more . Remember to keep the lunch box clear . " He crooked his arm ; Elaine took it and they sauntered off to the enclosure , a few hundred yards away . " Cute couple , " said Fitch , his shipshead pointed for breeze . " They should be , " said Hendricks . " Women , " said Benson and moved off . " Nervous ? " Hendricks asked Hondorp when they were waiting by themselves.  | " What from ? " " I do n't know . You seem a little withdrawn . " " Just thinking , " he said , trying to be neither snappish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about today . " " If you have any questions about anything , do n't be afraid to ask me , " she said . " When I 've accumulated a few , I 'll put them to you all at once . " Hondorp had had little experience of being led on by the beak , but he knew when it was happening what to do about it . The pique which had set this off , the annoyance at the disparity between Hendricks ' easy manner , ringless finger , and his present ignorance of her status  --  widow , divorcee , faker , mother of five  --  which the headwaiter 's farewell had forced on him , this annoyance he was unwilling to ask about , but eager to forget . Identifying its source , Hendricks found it both too trifling and too titillating to bother about . " You go on up now , " she said , a whip of command in her voice . " Another twist of the screw , " he thought . " All right . I 'm with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might suggest that I walk up there ? " " Try to hold your butt in a little . I think it 's that genteel stoop of yours that pushes it out . " A patronizing , **26;1784;TOOLONG turn of his lips countered this . " I 've got her when she starts that , " he thought . And correctly . Hendricks , watching him stroll off , his stoop perceptibly greater , his backside aimed at her , felt the rare twinge of a strategic error . " Not such a pushover after all , " she thought , loping slowly after him now , and smilingp69with even more than the anticipation she normally felt at the shooting of a golk . At the revelation that they were On Camera , that the breach of the enclosure 's peace had been staged , that the fire did n't burn , there was a pandemonium of shy joy . All the regulars but Miss Morseburger crowded around Golk and the golks , shaking their hands , congratulating them , asking when the program would be telecast . Fitch passed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourishings of constitutional delegates . At one suggestion that the **29;1812;TOOLONG was not without a certain technicalinterest , there was restrained rather than jeering laughter . " Perhaps so , " said Frankl generously . And this remark so restored equilibrium to the enclosure that even Miss Morseburger came forward to shake Golk 's hand , if briefly and sadly . The old people 's excitement roused a corresponding excitement in Hondorp , though one which permitted him to distinguish his from theirs . His own was that of an Olympian watching himself being recognized by mortals after the executionof an unearthly feat . He beamed as if from a cloud as Elaine autographed Frankl 's copy of Rehboch and the Viennese Middle Game . " I shall treasure it all my life , " said the little octogenarian . Elaine kissed his gray poll and said that she hoped that would be for some time then . " They sure are cute , " she said to Hondorp , squeezing his arm for emphasis.  |p70Hondor|p  's excitement was readily convertible . Indeed the whole day had been marked for him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come unless refueledby others . His eye coursed Elaine 's spectacular shape with that sense of large exploration which had been the key signature of his day . " Let 's you and me go out a little after , " she said with the animal tact that spared him the effort of working up to a similar proposal . He sighed with relief and nodded . Hendricks , who had watched them with angry amusement , told herself it was just as well that Hondorp get over " that stage . " " She can take the kinks out , and it 'll give him some assurance . Primitive , but , I suppose , necessary . " She went over to Golk and translated this into action . " Why do n't you let Hondorp off the hook for today ? He can go off and relax with the nigger . He 's had about as much of your crap as a sane man can take in a day . " Golk was bidding the chess players elaborate farewells , but sandwiched in his consent . " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can go on now . You too Elaine . We 'll show you the results tomorrow . " And he patted old Heinemannon the backside and said that some day he would enjoyplaying a real game with him . " What results ? " Hondorp asked Elaine as they walked off . " You know , " she said . " This golk we just shot here . What results were you thinking of ? " " I just do n't know , " he said , knowing of course that the confusion of the two distinct programs of action which had been thrown down to him today was something he was not going to work out with ease or speed . " I 'm going to straighten you all out , honey , " she said inp71that manner which was , as he saw it , its own caricature . " We 'll pump a little booze into you and then we 'll be able to pump all the other troubles out . " Too much , thought Hondorp . Life was n't built along such straight tracks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion was enough to clear the way , where more of the sheer , overt movement would have clotted in him the desire which had edged his day and which needed , he knew , to be planed off . They went to the Penny Bar . " One of the few stills that supplies Pernod in this town , " said Elaine . " And I got a penchantfor things French . Just like the frogs have for me and mine . " She put one of her legs around his under the table . " I knew you had plenty of life in you , " she added , feeling him tighten up . They drank for an hour , enough to free Hondorp from any remaining clot , yet not enough to free him from anything else . The other reason for coming to the bar was now unveiled to him : Elaine lived in the hotel above it . He was but eight floors away from the end of that desire whose fangs had bitten into him this morning . He could barely contain himself in the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started stripping at the door and fell on the bed . Hondorp reeled with an explosion of pleasure . After the ecstatic fall-out , they dragged their organs apart and lay , legs intertwined , breathing hard . " That myth about you Africans is true , " gasped Hondorp . Elaine laughed with fury . " That 's me , not Africa , " she said , " just me , " and she rolled over on him to extract anothergroan of weary pleasure . That what she supplied was so freely given and so inexhaustibly there , fattened Hon-P72dorp 's own supply . " You 're like the white man 's dream of it , " he managed after their next engagement . " That 's my aim in life , " she said . " I never sleep with a jig . " " Golk ought to get you on film . " " Oh , Hondorp-lover , " she said , draping over him and wriggling to squeeze out the tube 's last drop . " Golkie had me on film the second night . He shows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Golk , " muttered Hondorp , on the edge of sleep . He dropped off then , with a last , half-consciousglimpse of Elaine somehow all over him trying to coax another flicker from his alien , depleted flesh . P73Hondorp went down to the Parisak Building every day but Sunday . " We work constantly but easily , " said Golk . " Just turn up an hour or so before lunch . That way , some of that salivation is going to work for us , yet you wo n't get knocked out by your first stint . " " A strange schedule , " said Poppa Hondorp to himself as he left his son at the breakfast table still in bathrobe and pajamas . " Some uniform for a business man . " Now that Hondorp was a man of affairs , he luxuriated in the signs of idleness which before had shamed him . For Poppa Hondorp , business was business , and lousy as it was , it meant no pajamas at eight-thirty in the morning . The outfit was just one of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to talk about . Afterp74the initial shock , the minor alterations were , in fact , almost welcome . That first night , when his son had not come home until three in the morning , and worse , not telephoned warning of the impending defection , had caused the household to sway on its foundations . Dinner had been postponed until eight o'clock ; Poppa Hondorp had missed Groucho and Broken Arrow ( or Dragnet  --  he alternated ) and had waited up four and a half hours later than his usual bedtime . His son had found him snoring in front of the blank , humming TV screen . " You still up , Poppa ? " he asked with some fright and much surprise . Poppa Hondorp had staggered up from a dream to his son 's questioning face , and then held out his arms as if to embrace him . Whether he 'd changed his mind in mid-air or not , Hondorp did not know ; he did know that he 'd been simultaneously whacked on both cheeks , and that the whacks had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last " old-style " pronouncements , " No son of mine is coming into the home at four o'clock in the morning . " While Hondorp hesitated about whether to correct the hour , his father had burst into tears , kissed the cheeks where he 'd slapped them , and waddled off down the hall to his bedroom . Since that time , Poppa Hondorp had reacted to the injurieshis son inflicted with first theatrical , then actual stoicism , while his son tried to alleviate the pain by telephoningabout any derangement his plans might work in the household . But the suppression of what he was accustomed to give easy vent to wrought internal changes in Poppa Hondorp.  |p75A  lipoma began forming at the base of his neck , and with corporal sympathy his varicose veins twitched and swelled . Poppa 's own diagnosis of the neck ornament was " fatty depositdue to circulatory impairment caused by subvention of some parasitic organism , " but he did not venture beyond diagnosis to therapy . Indeed , he seemed to relish this bodily version of his family situation : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place a worm . " " You ought to let Frankhauser look you over , Poppa , " was his son 's advice . ( Frankhauser was a general diagnostician with whom Poppa Hondorp exchanged services . ) " No Frankhauser can bring me to health , darling . You know what ails me , " and the old man unleashed  --  in the theatrical mode  --  his immense version of a sigh , and toppled a half-inch of cigar ash into his coffee . He tipped the contents into his throat , shivered with melancholy pleasure , kissed his son on the cheek , called good-by to the cook , and limped  --  another concession to the theater  --  out of the room and front door . The breakfast exchanges , once the tensest of Hondorp 's days , were now but gentle prologues to them . Caught up in Golk 's fierce tide , Hondorp 's head swarmed with the novel procedures of editing , mixing , blooping , trimming , cutting , scouting , the special routines which composed the operation of making golks . Since all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his machine , all capable of doing a little bit of almost everything , Hondorp 's first weeks existed for him as a great storm of facts . That which gave it coherencewas the great fact that there was a storm and that he was the object , or chief barometer of it . For him , the storm became more and more Golk , the aspect of Golk in action , and the ubiquity and ever-moving knowingness which thisp76meant became for him , even before he was conscious that he 'd abandoned his amused , even faintly contemptuous admiration for Golk , a kind of credo . If , in the midst of some blood-letting job , he found on him Golk 's grin or wink or pat , storm turned to light and warmth , and the reason for all the blood became clear . The new knowledge was not only technical ; indeed , as Hendricks told him , the technical part was mere packaging . One of the pleasantest of the other parts was " scouting . " Two or three afternoons a week , golks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes not . They walked or drove , and as far as direction went , it was in the haphazard one that Hondorp had followed for years by himself . In no other way was it haphazard : they were doing reconnaissance work for future golks , and every glance was a study heavy with consequence . Each store , each street , each potential situation had to be assessed in terms of space for equipment , possibility of crippling disturbances , light , noise , the numerous prerequisites for usable golks . Scouting was neither relaxing nor exciting , but it was never boring ; at the end of an afternoon of it , Hondorp would go home and sleep . He usually went out on the expeditions with Hendricks . Golk liked to see them together . " You set each other off , " was his appraisal of their tandem appearances . " You 're both kind of sour , but Hendricks is light sour , Hondorp dark sour . " Under the pressures of association , Hondorp 's uneasy ignorance of Hendricks ' status gave way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references to their respective histories , and this led them to equality , if not yet companionship . Hendricks had begunp77the exchange , begun it purposely and carefully . Her old desireto keep what surrounded her on permanent alert was almost entirely gone . Not even the prospect of the comparativelyeasy victory she still saw in Hondorp drew her back to the battlefields where her independence had been shaped . The dark oddball , Hondorp , seemed to her a not unpleasantadjunct to a good many hours , a part of the soft turf on which she had luckily landed after being tossed over the cliff by George Hendricks . The occasions when they went out by themselves were , for both of them , preferable to the ones in which Golk joined them . In Hondorp 's third week , Golk had turned melancholy , or , at least , darkly thoughtful . And though he claimed to enjoy being with them , he communicated to them largely by issuing orders , or by snapped correction of their judgments . One day , after the three of them had shot some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her interpretation of the mood for Hondorp . Golk himself had gone back to the studio , and she and Hondorp sat at the counter of a hamburger joint . Below the level of the counter , Hondorp wiped his spoon on a paper napkin , and asked her , " Well , what is wrong with him ? " " Ambition , " she said bitterly . " He 's getting ready to un-load . " " That 's splendid . Why the I-smell-shit look ? " " I 'll tell you , " she said , and bit into the flavored lard of a doughnut while she thought how to tell him . For him , her head had taken on in the joint 's fluorescents a kind of vaporousgold which shook him as she had n't shaken him before . It was the vapor of inimitable gentility and prevailed against the gabardine slacks she wore and the dull crockery and rankp78doughnuts which , against her lips , seemed the gross world 's foul attempt to fuel the fine spirit . " It 's like Saturn , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least identifiable ones , stuck fast as we are . From what he 's planning now , we 're going to be one undifferentiated , subservient ring , just something to set him off . " For Hondorp , the vapor became annoying , a female fog . " Nonsense . " " What little identity we have now , he 's going to cut us loose from , every scrap of it . " " So what ? " said Hondorp , and he slurped his coffee to accentuatethe belligerence this suffragette protest roused in him . Speculation about motives or about the future was not his cup of tea , and female investment in such speculation stirred his rage . " What do we have to do that 's better , whether we 're partners or serfs ? " Hendricks ' face drew into battle formation , as he went on . " And who 're you to cast your great analytic powers on what your betters are doing ? " Hendricks slammed a fifty-cent piece on the counter , and did n't wait for change . Hondorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her . They did n't talk , but moved up Second Avenue at a clip which the sun soon reduced to a breathless amble . It reduced the force of anger and belligerence as well ; Hondorp threw in the towel , and , to the surprise of both , she accepted it . The towel consisted of a nod toward a hardware store and his saying , " What about Golk pounding some fellow 's alarm clock to pieces in front of him ? " " Chaplin , " she said . " Maybe even pre-Chaplin , " and she smiled . After a pause , he asked , " Well what is he working for ? What is it that could change our status so ? " He 'd said this even tenderly.  | " We 'll see , " she said with almost corresponding tenderness . " Sooner than we like . " Hondorp decided this was enough ; he trailed her back to the Parisak Building in silence . Fitch was screening one of the next week 's golks . They flopped on the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a department store who was approached by a sinister , though undisguised Golk who talked him into a corner and there flashed a parcel of hot diamonds at him . In five minutes , Golk had flicked off the buyer 's thin skin of respectability , enticed him into a deal , and then , after the announcement that they were " On Camera , " marvelously helped him retrieve his front and emerge as a shrewd , but essentially honest type , one who would not only sign the release slip , but who would write friends and relatives he had n't seen in years to be on the lookout for the program . Hondorp found himself feeling the humiliating anguish that the buyer was not feeling , and this suddenly turned into a wide glut of pity for the victims of Golk 's trade . He looked across to send this feeling to Hendricks . She was asleep , her head against the back of a prop cart , her face looking not girlish , but fragile , imperiled . The qualms he had been feeling flowed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt in their conjunct force the first tremor in the Golk scaffolding . " A growth pain , " he said to himself , but the rock he had built on was not where it had been that morning . The next perceptible shift of the rock came two weeks later . He walked in the door one morning to hear Golk 's voice callp80to him over the office loudspeaker , " Just in time for a screening , my boy . " " Why 's he been waiting for me ? " wondered Hondorp . The golks filed in . Golk followed , took his throne , the room 's upholstered chair , switched the lights off and the projector on , and Hondorp discovered why his presence was necessary . The screen filled with Golk in a Harpo Marx wig with a wad of cotton sticking from his right ear . Over him bent Poppa Hondorp , his lipoma swollen and inflamed , his face brindled by the intermittent pressure of his circulatory system . Hondorp felt his insides detach themselves from mooringsand churn around until he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nausea . Poppa Hondorp was removing the cotton from Golk 's ear and peering inside with speculum and reflector . " There seems , " he said after brief inspection , " to be no affliction of the auricle , neither tumor  --  benign or malignant  --  eczema , serous or sebacious cyst . From your contortions , I come close to thinking that the source of the Nile , so to speak , is the external auditory canal , suffering maybe under impacted cerumen  --  wax , for the laity  --  or perhaps circumscribed or furuncular inflammation , or , and this would be somewhat less likely , otomycosis . I think not , however . My sentiments now incline me to think we may have ourselves a little suppuration of the middle ear . " Golk 's face widened with terror . " Middle ear , Doctor ? " and he caressed his two large ones , his face seamed with cretinous bewilderment . Poppa Hondorp roared with pleasure . " Delightful , my friend . A delightful sally . " " Sally ? " asked Golk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chronic . " Chronic ? "  | " Recurrent . Repeated . No isolated phenomenon . Has it happened before , this ache ? " " Not this one . " " Come now . An ache of this sort ? " " Not to me . " " I see . " " My dear father suffered frequently from terrible ear-aches . " Poppa Hondorp 's face crumbled at this . " Your poor father , " he said sadly , lost for a moment till his professional opportunities were remembered . " Has he been cured of them , or did  --  " " Yes , the Great Reaper took him off , " said Golk . " Eight years ago , the eleventh of May . " Poppa Hondorp stared pensively at the blond mop which covered such filial remembrance . " Many 's the long night I spent , a warm cloth pressed against his throbbing ear . " " Loving , " mused Poppa Hondorp . " Very loving . " " You have children , Doctor ? " " A son , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His tone was elegiac . " Father and son , " said Golk , as if inscribing a chapter heading on a blank manuscript . Poppa Hondorp filled in the page . " A noble relationship . But packed to the margins , packed , impacted with heartbreak . With great heartbreak . " He went to the window , his lipoma pointing angrily askew like an auxiliary , but mutinoushead . " Ingratitude , the serpent 's tooth , " urged Golk wistfully . Poppa Hondorp 's lipoma swayed in what seemed negation . " That 's too strong , " he said . " The matter is not trea/son , just  --  how shall I say it ?  --  a carelessness , inattention , lack of thought , but terrible , all terrible . Worse might be better . You would be stiffened to resist . But against so soft a thing , who can push ? " Hondorp , on the dark floor , put his head in his palms and rocked back and forth . Around and in his head the sad roar of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an hourglass in which filial love ran out " the thin neck of old age . " Hondorp looked up at Golk 's actual , bare skull gleaming in the projection machine 's light , eyes fixed on the screen with a kind of absorbed detachment , the eyes of an alert , ferocious hound . Hondorp pressed his hands against his stomach and kept his eyes on the screen . The golk concluded on a large , paternal sigh . There was no reversal , no announcement that cameras and microphoneswere fixed to opposite windows , that they were On Camera . It was a treatment reserved for only the most successfulgolks . The lights were switched on and Golk swiveled toward Hondorp . " You have a gifted father , " he said . " One in a million . " " Thank you , " said Hondorp coldly . " I always give my golks who make the grade a surprise like this . Like a graduation present . " He paused , the weight of the anticipated " Thank you " hanging over Hondorp . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seeing the near-and-dear up on the screen gives you an audience reactionyou do n't get even from seeing yourself . " " I see . " " Well , what do you think ? " " Of  --  ? " " The golk . " Hondorp considered . " There was a disconcerting smear on the top right of half the early frames . "  |p83Klebba  reached over Elaine 's legs and clapped Hondorp on the back . " A master 's retort , Hondorp . Oh , is he cool , this boy . " Golk nodded approvingly . " When Golkie showed me Mother Klebba filching change from my desk drawer to pay the milk bill , I nearly cut the throat . Mine . Half of AmsterdamAvenue put the finger on her for a year . " " You mean these little family scenes are shown to  --  to the public ? " asked Hondorp , anger and amazement breaking down his controls . A roar from all the golks but Hendricks greeted this inquiry . " Our boy 's been bit , " said Benson triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way the mop flops , " said Klebba . " When you work for Golk , you give all , right , Golkie ? " Golk nodded with kindly dignity . " Poppa signed a release ? " " Ask him , " advised Golk . " You just go home and ask him tonight . " Hondorp shook his head and indicated that that was exactly what he was going to do . Poppa Hondorp was eating dinner in front of " This Is Your Life " when his son came home . " Poppa ? " " Wait till the commercial , darling , " whispered the old man . Hondorp sat and watched Ralph Edwards interrogatingan old movie actress about her second husband 's suicide . " Ups and downs , " said Poppa Hondorp at the commer/cial . " Two-column box on the front page when that one passes , " this with a gesture toward a close-up of the actress . " Imagine it . Maybe a picture  --  inside-page picture . That 's this world . The whole life is lived on the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ralph Edwards was leading in the actress 's elder sister whom she had not seen in thirty-five years . They fell into each others ' arms sobbing , and Poppa Hondorp wiped his eyes . At the next commercial , Hondorp grabbed the bit . " What did Golk do to you , Poppa ? " " Ahh , sonny dear . I 've meant to tell you . Have n't had a chance . Amazing thing happened . In the office comes to me this personage , looks immediately like some moron or imbecile . And who is it ? Yes , you know . It 's that employer of yours , Golk , with a wig , cameras he gets Nurse Hurwitz to let him put over the windows , microphones coming out of my instruments . This was some amazing thing , I 'll tell you . A shock , incredible . Sonny , I can not thank you enough for it . " What ? " " He told me how you 'd suggested it , and I told him , ' Typicalof my boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You liked it , Poppa ? " " When will it be on the machine ? " " You want it shown , Poppa ? " " Want it shown ? " repeated Poppa Hondorp , seeing a discrepancybetween his own view and his son 's . " Want it ? Of course I want it . A private citizen , suddenly , by the caprice of the gods , enjoying a vast forum like a man of public repute . Of course , my darling . What did you suggest me for ifp85you did not want it shown ? This is nothing to paste in an album . " " My God , " said Hondorp to himself . " He thanks me . " That his father should relish the opportunity of being the butt of millions believing all the while he was the star guest of some forum program , this was even worse than if his father had been blackmailed into letting the ridiculous displaybe telecast . It was incomprehensible to him . He regardedthe twin fixities of his father and the machine , the clomping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other . " Is it for this ? " he asked himself . " For these that I 've changed my life ? To stuff those jaws ? " and his vision was of reciprocal , simultaneous cannibalism . He got up and went into the kitchen , disinterred twelve inches of salami from the salvaged remnants of string beans , steak butts , rotting cheeses , and plastic containerscolored by the last week 's gravies and dribblings which Marie 's Gascon economy stacked in the Kelvinator . " No wonder Gascony 's almost empty , " he muttered with fury , and , one by one , he dashed the oozing stinks into the garbage pail outside the back door . Weary , he sliced four inches off the salami , poured a mahogany Danish beer into a genuine Steinkrug , and brought what his father called the " TV Snackchen " into the living room . The balm of the Late Show soon closed over his day . For the next week his father 's breakfast discourse centered about his forthcoming " debut on the mass media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " his son sometimes wondered . ) Where young Hondorp had formerly been interrogatedabout his work along such lines as " Who 's the real brains , Tex or jinx ? " or " Why did Arthur really fire Julius ? " now Poppa Hondorp posed such questions to him as " Should one speak in the normal tone of voice for best results ? " and " Do certain combinations of colors upset the camera lenses ? " These questions , like the others , went unanswered , but this did not upset the old man or deflect him from asking others . He asked now , as he had pronounced earlier , as a way of better digesting his breakfast . The pace of questioning was advanced a couple of notches after Hondorp announced that Golk had set a date for the telecast . On the actual day , Golk sent Hondorp home early  --  the program had an early evening slot  --  to note his father'sreactions . When he came into Golk 's cave the next morning , the opening thrust was , " Well ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What the hell does that mean ? " " With undivided attention . Perhaps he watched it a little better . When Sullivan , or Groucho or Lucy is on , he 's practicallyin the machine . He watched it very closely . " " Nothing else ? How about when he saw himself ? " " There was a momentary recognition , as if he 'd seen me somewhere downtown , but that passed . He might have been watching Sullivan , no , someone wise like General Mac-Arthur . " " Hm . " " He sometimes laughed at himself , but without any embarrassmentthat I could see . " " That 's the idea , " said Golk . " I knew there 'd be some/thing special . He saw himself being foolish and disowned himself . The golk acted as a corrective . " He took a green cigarillo out of a drawer , snapped a wooden match across a crack in the desk surface , and lit up . " He saw a fool , " said Hondorp , quietly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact same shenanigans to-morrow . " Golk frowned , leaned his head back on the chair rest , and retired into himself . This was dismissal , and Hondorp went into Hendricks ' little cubbyhole across the way . " What are you doing ? " he asked for salutation . The golks pretended to no amenities . " Description . " This meant writing a short description of a forthcoming program for a prospective sponsor 's agency . ( Although You 're On Camera was going to be sustained by the network for whatever portion of the thirteen-week networkcontract it took to find a sponsor , the golks were frequentlyengaged by the network ad men to help sell the program . ) " How did the old man like it ? " Hondorp told her what he had told Golk , though the recital was more patently venomous . " Serves you right , " said Hendricks with the contained anger which Hondorp saw as another mark of high style . " What the hell does that mean ? " he responded in what he hoped was kind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shit , and you know it . You just trotted up and ate shit because he threw it on your table . You deserve any embarrassment it caused you . " " May I ask what happened to your little family golk ? " he asked . Hendricks looked at him the way a queen might look atp88an unknown man who 'd made , out of the blue , an obscene sexual proposal to her . Hondorp felt himself strung out on the look for what seemed minutes , until she let him off with " Do n't you think he knows I 'd have cut his throat if he 'd fooled around like that with me ? " Of the numerous routines to which he was introduced during his first weeks with the golks , Hondorp became most expert at what Golk called his " embassies . " Golk almost never wrote memos ; he sent messages via ambassadors who , as his images , were given more or less cartes blanches . Hondorpwas soon regarded as an ideal chief of mission , one whose success was grounded in thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , the code of injunctions , the table of peccadilloes , of venial and of mortal sins . Even in his second week on the job , Hondorp was sent to the three or four offices which geared Golk 's operation with the network 's , and with a regularity which endowed him with executive aura in the general eye . Hondorp had always had a kind of presence ; now he had radiance , or , as the occasion warranted , magnitude . Golk planned the missions roughly , but with sweep . There were usually two ambassadors dispatched , and the effect was a scene , one playing the sponge , the other the adamant , or one the whiner , the other the hysteric . It depended on the mission . As in other cases , Hondorp 's partner was usually Hendricks . Their first joint mission had been a financial one.  |p89Golk  's quarterly allotment was used up : without telling anyone why , he had hired four people as a research staff . It had something to do with his plans for the network show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been unable to reveal anyway , namely the reasons for hiring such a staff , and to get the network to place such a staff on the Golk budget as a regular item . It was not , according to Golk , a difficult mission . " They ca n't not fork over , or we 'd quit . But you may have to take a few whacks for me . " This constituted the whole of Golk 's instructions . Hendricks did not , apparently , find them short shrift , but led Hondorp off with businesslike dispatch . For a change , she wore a dress , a vertically striped tie-silk which , in the fashion she liked , called attention to her height and displayed its contrived gaucherie with expensive materials . The dress also revealed a great pair of legs . " These execs letch ten hours a day , " she said , explaining the outfit for Hondorp . She led him down a fifteenth-floor corridor past posh apertures and into an office which opened out like a spatula from its reception area stem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve of light Swedish wood behind which bloomed a head like a casaba melon , a hairless stretch of pale yellow which , to Hondorp , blinking in the bright room , seemed momentarily featureless . When the melon said , " Come sit down . I 'm Lurcher , " Hondorp made out the tiny ripples which constituted nose , mouth , and ears . He took Lurcher 's hand and gave his name . ( Lurcher almost never stood up : the immense head was the illegitimate fruit of a brief , if globular stem . ) " I know of you , " said Lurcher . " Eighty-five a week , but I know you . And glad to know you . " Hondorp slumped in a butterfly chair not made forp90slumping . Hendricks was already down , exhibiting the legs . " Nice , nice , " mused Lurcher . Hendricks outlined Golk 's need . Lurcher moved the small pips of his eyes till they pointed at hers . " In a few weeks , " he said , " you 're big-time , official network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be partially free of your depredations . You 'll clear your thievery with the agency man . As for now , tell Golk to fire three of them . We 'll pay for one . Since when does your outfit use research people anyway ? " " We 're branching out , " said Hendricks , stretching a thigh . " Nice , " said Lurcher quietly . " Golk has big ideas . " " He always has had them , " said Lurcher , back without dropping a beat . " For these ideas he needs researchers , " said Hendricks , borrowing New York syntax for authority . " Ideas used to come cheaper to him . It 's been one of the great things about Golk . He 's never really cost anybody money . Has n't made much , but has n't cost much . He 's a lesson . We use him as a model budget case . " Lurcher scrounged his face till the dark pips seemed to pop out of his head . " Now he wants to go busting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a very difficult thing to see , Lurcher . And the point here is he 's never cost you anything , and he 's done a lot of good for you , so let him have some leeway without making a fuss about it . " Hondorp cleared his throat and spoke his first word . " Surely you people do n't want to worry Golk about four piddling researchers just as he 's on the verge of making lots of money for you . Or are you just trying to test us ? "  |p91The  pips seemed to squirt at Hondorp . " Not a very good line , young man  --  " Lurcher was two years younger than Hondorp  --  " but it 'll do for today . I 'm too weary to wrestle the two of you . " He shivered with pleasure at the sexual undercurrent of this . " I 'll make out authorization . One month , contingent on sponsorship . " The face smoothed out to rind texture . " I 've got an extra ticket for that jazzmatazz at Newport , Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz after watching Leonard Bernstein 's Omnibus lecture on it . He had since bought a thousand albums , three hi-fi sets and hired small combos for solo evenings at home with his girl friends . " I 'll drop you a memo , " said Hendricks . " Thank you . " The mission was over . She got up , smiled coldly at Lurcher , and led Hondorp out of the office before he could make a more elaborate farewell than " So long , " called with his back to Lurcher . " Keep them at arm 's length and you 'll get what you want around here , " she told him as they moved toward the elevator . They reported back to Golk who acknowledged the resultwith a brief smile of gratitude and pronounced Hondorpa subtle negotiator . " A man of parts , Herbert . You 've come a long way in a short while . " The use of his first name dazzled Hondorp , and he smiled the coy smile of infancy . " Yes sir , you 're getting to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences yet , " said Hondorp as he forced the rapture to seep from him . " No , " said Golk dourly . " I do n't see the newsies around me either . We do n't make the papers any more . At least when we 're functioning right . We 're what the magazine people call the back of the book . ' " " Sucking hind tit , " said Hendricks.  | " Not that it matters , " said Golk with an unhappiness that meant it did . " Like the Yaddo River , that front-page world 's too thin to plow , too mucky to navigate . " He smiled , the phrase restoring his vigor and sense of place . " Did you ever see that Disney show on atoms ? " Catechism was his way of changing course . " The one with the pingpong balls knockinginto other pingpong balls until a whole field is full of bouncing balls . Simulated a chain reaction or something . " " I did n't see it , " said Hondorp . " It was god-awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . " I 'm just using it as an illustration of the complexity of our position . Every mission , every golk , every move we make influences fifteen or twenty other moves , other posi-tions . " " The longest way round is the longest way home , " said Hendricks , wishing all of a sudden that she were at the beach at Watch Hill letting the sun knock out the least threat of golkism . For a half second she leaned as if to go only to feel Golk 's voice tugging her back . " Now here 's my point , " said Golk leaning forward towardHondorp and Hendricks perched on opposite corners of his desk and looking in his view like suburban versions of the Medici tomb statues . He paused to contemplate the resemblance before picking up . " Every request we make of these boys is a threat to their image of perfection  --  which is routine . Routine means control for them ; the new they can not contemplate with ease . Our old format is a habit for them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are on top of it . They know what to expect , and they can wait us out . For out we 'll go , like everyone else in this business , if we stay the same . And they want us out , even though it mightp93look like a break in their routine . It is n't . They 'll just come up with another program , a lukewarm version of our half hour that 'll be a comfortable habit for a while till it drops out . Alternation of the lukewarm : that 's their formula for novelty , their proclamation of service to the industry and the nation . Every move we make to fashion a change for ourselves annoys them . Maybe not in so many words  --  " " There are indeed a lot of words , " said Hendricks , but Golk only shook his head , flicking off a bug . " They may even think of it in the term they use for refusaland rejection , money , ' but it 's the other , and they 're going to be gunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us twisted around their thirteen-week clauses like strings around tops , and if we do n't spin the way they pull , we wo n't spin at all . So we must pay heed , much heed . We 'll start slow , start in old-style , or just slightly different golks , and then , when they 've been lulled , we 'll hit before they know they 've been hit . And then maybe it 'll be too late for them to do anything about it . " " And what is it that they 're going to be hit with ? " asked Hendricks . Her legs were on the desk now and she coiled toward Golk as if he were charming her with some magic flute . " Aah , " intoned Golk for response . " You 'll know soon enough . Right now , wait . Sit tight . Say nothing to nobody . Lurcher 'll call you in a couple of days : they digest novelty at the rate of a sick elephant , but they 'll know something 's cooking . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time saves nine . " Golk rattled off five or six like saws in a distracted , distant manner , a machine that went on sputteringthough fuelless . And then , he leaned back against the chair rest and closed his eyes.  |p94They  looked at each other and walked out . " A real bugger , " said Hendricks , but the vehemence mingled with the puzzlement that Golk seldom failed to deposit with her . She and Hondorp looked at each other , a pair of sailors who , their ship gone down , come upon each other swimming in the sea.  | " There 's four ways of being successful , " Golk liked to say , " and they go by way of the suits , hearts , spades , diamonds , clubs . " If he was exercising the autobiographical mode , he would add , " I 've known them all : I 've loved up , worked up , bought up , and smashed up . Not that I 'm starting to devote myself to looking back . Things are just beginning to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would jab a finger toward Fitch or Hondorp or some other measure of comparison . It was a somewhat oversimplified summary of an involved career , but the direction , at least , was right . It was up nearly all the way . For Golk , no other direction was then conceivable ; everything that could have been called reversal or failure was converted into anecdotal roughage.  |p96Of  the four suits , Golk particularly overstaked his claim on diamonds : he sprang from neither money , mansion , nor a name . As a matter of record , he did n't even spring from a Golk . The name for most of his life had been Pomeroy . A year after he came to New York , an analyst at a cocktail party told him to change it , and to change everything else as well , girl friends , address , style , told him not to write home to his parents , or , if possible , to forget them entirely . It was a party suggestion , one carried over from an outmoded and disastrous therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bliss . For the night hours of a week he debated names from Vanderbilt and Caesar to Smith and Shigemitsu . It was a cut of his new vision that opened Golk to him , a syllablewhose vague and ugly suggestibility signaled the way to that montage of the common and unique which bounded the role he began to see himself playing in the world into which he 'd plunged , the new world of New York television after the end of the Second World War . This world was far away from Providence , his origin , and the Boston Store where like , and sometimes alongside , his father he 'd clerked , and unlike him , saved and saved to make a break , although not too far from the first breaking-point , the army , where he 'd been a non-commissioned star of the Troop Information and Education lectures , a first-class Fridayafternoon speaker on " Argentine : Land of the Pampas , " " Our Policy in the Middle East , " and any other worldbeatingtopic the directives pointed to and outlined . And here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balloonof Pfc. , the son of radio network aristocracy , a wise miserable who came up after a session of " The B-57 , Architectof Triumph , " and said , " Come see me when you get out , " Lurcher , whose corpulence had in another year foun/dered in the obesity which secured his discharge , who went back to New York in that spring of 1945 to get a hold in the network world , and who concealed in his oceanic bulk a nerve of recollection which tingled when the bigheaded Pomeroy walked into his office two years later , cavernous with anticipation . The first couple of years were Golk 's Wanderjahre . His official time was spent with an audience research outfit holed up obscurely in the old network building . ( Such outfits did n't become great powers till the fifties . ) Not a job which consumed much but complacency , and so Golk moved around the new menagerie of television , handled the new animals , the cranes and crabs , belops and telops , arcs and amps , moved around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producers , agency men , packagedealers , talent-prowlers , and hangers-on , the breed which was beginning to shove the old radio crowd  --  those too slow or dumb to join them  --  off the face of the earth . Half the hours of the day he watched shows , varieties , cookeries , serials , news spiels , quizzes , and he gauged their tempi , camera work , peripeties , assessed their evanescent triumphs and enduring inanities . The assessments he recordedin notebooks , large two-dollar legal notebooks which he filled up at the rate of one a month with observations , ideas , criticisms , hopes ; he pasted newspaper clippings in them , wrote up anecdotes , plots , quotations from books , movies , street talk . It was from this quarry that he drew out the entry which he rewrote one day for Lurcher three years after his arrival in New York . They were more or less celebrating at an anniversarydinner , " less " because they ate together about once a month without the need of an occasion , and " more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Golk had been in New York for three years . The consciousness prepared them for what came from the dinner . At dessert , Golk took a piece of paper out of his jacket and read it slowly : Movies , Plays and TV : as far as movies and tv go , you have same possibility of fluidity of place and time , especially filmed TV of course . BUT , in tv , you do n't have a large illuminatedscreen focusing attention of a large audience , nor can you avoid the dispersing of attention a home situation invites  --  noises , trips to ice-box and john  --  not counting commercials , difficulty of watching smallish picture projectedon convex surface . Because of these difficulties , TV demands a smaller canvas , fewer characters , scenes , time shifts than the movies and more or less limited actions . Still , TV has the best of the movie traits , the camera directing the audience to any aspect of a scene , any detail , unusual or otherwise which will best express the flow of the story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . So you can hit harder , quicker , and with fewer words than you can on the stage . On the Stage , you need high-pressured action or words to take the audience initially  --  though the shock of being inside that fourth wall is something  --  but , since the physical focus is less intense , you can take things at an easier pace . You try for longer , more complicated actions , follow more characters , deal with more themes . So TV and Stage , the thing they share is immediacy . Live TV even has it over the stage , because in news events , or what I 'm proposing , there 's no script . You 're really on the high-wire . However , no spontaneous performance can be too good for too long , especially under the close , movie-type focus . So even the real-laxed , Murrow-Garroway pitch , ca n't last too long . Entertainmentneeds more dependable material ; the TViewp99ca n't be organized spontaneously unless life is  --  and IT is n't . Period . So , the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By concentrating on small situations rigged as dramatically as possible , allowing for maximum spontaneity yet putting people , amateur human beings , under pressures which will bring out more or less foreseen responses , responses which will reveal those people dramatically , the artificial calling on the real to produce drama . More than a snooping eye and ear ( Eye Ear You  --  title ? ) , a controlling idea ! Golk looked at Lurcher , his face heavy with inquiry . " What do you think ? " Lurcher had the same gob of carameled eclair in his mouth that he 'd had when Golk started reading . It was the most telling response he could have made . He now got the mess down his throat , spooned up another for fuel , swallowed it , then looked at Golk 's questioning head tilted on his in close-up . " Eye eared you , " he said , and quivered with pleasure , the table squeaking with the movement . " The title 's out . " " Just a joke , " said Golk . " Joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not without a certain lack of disinterest . " A quiver . " If I get it . And I think I get it , though you should learn to mix your theoreticalcrap with some examples if you want to move anywhere in the upper echelons . You ca n't explain anything upstairs without an example . " Golk supplied one . " Like if there was a cigar in that eclair of yours . " Lurcher rippled at the threat . " Good , " he said . " Dangerousbut good . I 'm going to take it upstairs . And we 'll see . "  | " I could n't ask for more , " said Golk , and his face sloughed off its inquiry , and became again a receptacle for belabored nourishment . Upstairs meant , one way or another , Dr. Parisak . Ruler of an empire larger than Tamerlane 's , more complex , richer , more powerful in its governance of the million or so lives which depended directly , and the billion or so which dependedindirectly on it , Parisak was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that no detail is too petty , no development too minor to earn their contempt or dismissal . All network programs either began as his ideas or existed with his approval , and New York programs which were being groomed for the network , all , that is , but those of purely local interest , likewisesuffered his perilous scrutiny . Golk wrote a Parisak-type memorandum ( " To , " " From , " " In re , " " 1 , " " 2 , " " 3 , " " Thus " ) based on his conception , had it polished  --  or perhaps made palatable  --  by Lurcher , and then by the sharpie Director of Programs , Dobel man , who sent it all the way up to the top floor . A week later , it came back stamped with the gold-laced initial " P. " You 're On Camera made its debut on New York 's WPAR two months later as summer replacement for an evening variety show . Golk rented a two-room studio apartment on Eighty-eighth Street off West End Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sixteenmm. cameras , two tape recorders , and a scanner . The stationprocessed the film , but Golk edited it . Indeed , for his first program he did everything , scouted , planned , set up the lights and recorders , placed the cameras , acted , transported , edited . The mechanics in the garage where the first golk was shot helped him carry the equipment into hisp101fourteen-year-old Hudson . One of the mechanics , Golk 's first victim , was Fitch . A bone-thin , palpitant grease monkey , Fitch was given a double-talk treatment about the defects of Golk 's Hudson . Fitch underwent the scene with a leguminous deadpan which , at the very end , broke for a slow smile of comprehensionthat something was not as it should be , a smile that established the classic reversal which Golk and the small group of viewers who became his loyal followers that first summer were always to treasure . Two days later , Fitch becameGolk 's first assistant , his cameraman , set-arranger , actor , factotum , paraclete . His departure from the greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nine working years of his life became the pattern of his master 's recruitment procedures . Golk 's instinct for the misplaced life , the sheared gift , the convertibility of his fellows was like a poet 's gift for metaphor , although more single-minded : the direction of the conversion was always the same : the world 's victims were transformed into his own and then into the exploiters of other victims . Golk 's eye for the true displacement power of people was guided by his awareness of their ability to generate sympathy and antipathy . This ability was the lode he sought and from which he took his gold . Fitch had not been the first lode stripped : Golk 's first mine had been himself . Golk 's progress was guided almost always by principles , not imposed on , but deduced from experience , and then appliedp102with rigor to what eventually served as a further source of principles . In the four years of You 're On Camera , there were four major and numerous subordinate classes of golks , and these were worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first class or stage  --  for Golk thought in terms of progress  --  was the least carefully formulated of the four . The early golks of most of that first summer just were , the product of Golk 's original , general notion . The second stage of golks was triggered by an experience Golk had had about a month after the first program was telecast in New York . He was taking his nightly walk down Riverside Drive by the Soldier 's and Sailor 's Monument , a couple of blocks from his apartment , and thinking about a paragraph in the New York World-Telegram 's TV column praising the show . It was the first public confirmation of his accomplishment , and although the paragraph was far from understanding his real aims , Golk felt that the happy response was itself clear enough indication that he had affected people . He sat on the white steps of the Monument looking up the river toward the Washington Bridge where a plump moon struggledout of the steel suspension wires to queen it over the Jersey neons and palisades . Golk had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , and he was engaged in this process , his body tense with the effort to retain the scene 's detail , the river smell and the breeze , the disposition of the moon and the lights and boats , when a dapper little head blotted out his view , asked for a match , and , successful in this petition , went on to a more demanding one . The interruption itself , more than any invidious characterizationof the solicitation led Golk to grab the little man'sp103lapels and whisper to him , mob-style , to move out of the way before he got blasted into the Hudson . Into the fair little head flowed a look of such pure terror that Golk brought it up to his own to study it . His study caused the expression to alter first to amazement , then to curiosity and finally to the dispersed truculence which was the face 's habitualset . Golk put the man out of his reach as if the night were a garbage-disposal unit , and , with the flash which he had already come to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that the arousal of such pure looks was what he wanted for his golks . This was the origin of that second stage of what came to be called golkism . Such golks started appearing during the program 's first regular season in 1951-52 , and they centered about such situations as people opening letters informing them that they 'd been fired , children at the beach seeing their pails and shovels in the grip of sea monsters , women noticing suicidal types balanced on their living-room ledges . The obituary of the second stage was recorded in a notebook entry in the spring of 1952 : The names of emotions  --  love , hate , pity , etc.  --  are just hideaways for the thousand feelings which creep under those labels , or rather , which language tries to bundle away in them . Even the simplest feelings  --  emotions  --  wonder what the difference is ?  --  are impure compared with the purity of the words . The third stage of golkism had already begun in Golk 's second thirty-nine-week season . This stage revolved around scenes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weeps to laughs , " as the journal entry had it , through a whole cycle of discoveries . The golks took longer to make  --  sometimes days  --  and editing became the crucial part of their production , for only the emotional crests of the cycles were chosen and these had to be ingeniouslyjuxtaposed for dramatic power . The golks centeredabout such situations as people dispatched on endless errands , errands which were not completed until the victim realized that his own reactions were the object of the errand , that , as he played shuttlecock between two or more golkmen , he was registering the varying forces which they applied to him . The golks involved the use of four or sometimesfive cameras , but Golk had local sponsors now and he was seldom bothered by or about expenses . This third stage brought its own personnel with it : Klebba , a New York hackdriver , who 'd been the victim of a golk which saw him trying to collect a fare from a corpse bleeding in the back seat . Once again , the discovery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discovery of means to slake them . The third stage lasted less than a year and yielded to what Golk called " The Quickies , " brief , often silent scenes of people coming out of the subway into bright sunshine , eatingalone in restaurants , taking walks in the Park , looking at children or in shop windows . The kernel of the scenes was a single close-up , the fingering of a tie or wallet , tremblinghands , a smile , the more or less routine response to familiar situations which had been scouted for days by one of the golks . There were shots of passers-by typing messages on the typewriter outside Olivetti , a priest alone at a sixo'clockmass , a waiter picking up an inadequate tip . Thep105program itself was composed of a group of Quickies based on varied responses to similar situations woven together with narrative commentary by Golk . The fourth , or penultimate , stage of golkism was concerned with what Golk called " beat . " The notebook entry which dealt with it went as follows : Every decent show , every worth-while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat . Music , people 's talk , poems , love , meals , the stars . Look at the few real programs the medium 's developed , say Dragnet or a few of the westerns . They 've got it . They have ( 1 ) regular ways of breaking off scenes  --  Dragnet has the repeated question and sharp comeback  --  ( 2 ) penetration in depth  --  Dragnet has the close-up monologue of crook , victim , and witness  --  ( 3 ) development  --  D. has either the early capture of the wrong man , a long detailed chase , or , the more or less lucky find  --  " I just saw . . . "  --  and ( 4 ) conclusion  --  D. has the capture and sentencing . You could write it out like music . If you 're in another room , and ca n't hear the words , just the sound of the program , you can guess what 's going on from the tone and tempo , the BEAT  --  the slow , broken-up comic interludes with Frank , the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real-life situations , and yet to put one 's own beat on top of them , that 's what we 've got to do now . Kind of a round , beat over beat , though of course the life beat wo n't be , or at least is n't , too well defined ( unless we had a saint or somebody like that as victim ) . The Stage Four golks began in the middle of the program'sthird regular season in New York . They were assembledinto patterns composed of reversals , discoveries , double-takes , and these were timed , combined with narra/tive and musical themes , and blended with special camera effects . The results fell into a small number of recognizable categories , so that after a while , Golk could announce at the beginning of a show that the next golk would be a " fast and looser " or a " slow shifter " and thus anticipate the rhythmic pattern against which the golk could play minor variations . It was toward the beginning of the Stage Four golks that Hendricks joined the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept because of her looks and manner , though to Hondorp 's surprise  --  when he later saw the kinescope  --  themanner was unlike the one he thought of as being her style ; she was more the elegant ratee , a masterful portrait of a staved-off collapse with the camera focusing on her chewed fingernails and skin , and then islanding her amidst the boxes of shoes in Delman 's . Despite the theoretical failure of her golk  --  there had been no way to impose a dramatic pattern and still preserve the integrity of the portrayal  --  the scene was one of the twentyfiveor so golks which Golk thought of as his showpieces . That most of these showpieces were theoretical botches amused more than dismayed him . Indeed , in his more and more frequent discussions of golkism , he kept insisting on the inevitability of the gap between theory and results : for him , it was a mark of the importance of his accomplishments . And the accomplishments seemed more and more important to him . Even before he 'd come to the last stage of golkism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public concern , and he discussed it with the respectful distance usually reserved for older and more conspicuous monuments of culture and civilization.  |p107On  a Friday morning early in June , two weeks before they were to go on network , Golk unfolded to Hondorp and Hendricks the plan of Stage Five , the stage which was to see the sensational bloom and conclusion of his career . The atmosphere of unfolding was special : Golk wore his navybluesuit , vintage 1937 , worn for every occasion he deemed too formal for slacks and polo coat . Hondorp , summoned with Hendricks into the cave , wondered if they were going to a funeral and questioned the propriety of his own gleamingChipp 's sport coat . " Let 's go , " said Golk secretively , and he led them out across the avenue to the UN Secretariat Building Restaurant high up over the East River . " Lofty thoughts , lofty places , " he said on the terrace , and he directed a wide glance at the low-lying surroundings , giving the stubby breadth of the Parisak Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to the waiter . " Excuse me , sir . " " Irish on ice with bitters and an orange rind . " " That can be arranged , " said the waiter . " Invented it for the occasion , " explained Golk to Hendricksand Hondorp . Hondorp nodded coldly . He sat as a pupil , a brilliant pupil who holds skepticism in reserve for every word , pruningshears for rhetoric , the hard eye for self-approbatory gush . Golk stretched his huge jaws and released the initial question of the catechism , his favorite expository method which , in Hendricks ' view , he derived from Stalin 's sessionsp108with the Comintern . ( " It 's to shake you up , not to ask youanything . " ) " Did you ever read this book by Wilson ? " " You know the one I mean , this one about the Finnish station . " " Ah , " said Hondorp . " Edmund Wilson . " " That 's the ticket . " " I 've read everything , " said Hondorp , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendricks observed loudly that his flesh was certainly sad enough , and Hondorp smiled wearily in acknowledgment of the allusion . Golk did not so much bypass this Abbott-Costelloism as not perceive it . " I 'm thinking about a passage there , " he said . " Sets Marx and Engels up against Rennin and Mish-litt . " " Against whom ? " said Hondorp . " Renan and Michelet , " said Hendricks , with slow , pure French tones . Hondorp twisted his lip for independence . Golk plowed ahead . " Here 's the point . Mishlitt and Renninwere ambitious in literature and philosophy ; they wanted to do good artistic jobs of writing history . Marx and Engels ? No . They did n't give a shlitt how the writing came out . " A pause for laughs , and a quick pick-up after none came . " They wanted to push their stuff , make it count , make it reform , make it explode in the world of here and now , not in the millenium . Remember that part ? " Hondorp nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ? " from Hendricks . " They changed the whole world , that 's what . The whole world they changed . You think we 'd be having to sit in this UN building here if they had n't lived ? No , we would not . Did they have anything Rennin and Mishlitt did n't ? "  |p109Pause  . " No . I mean yes . One thing . Direction . They were artists . Wilson says so . That may be the way they 're going to survive . BUT , in their time , and for the hundred years which followed , what counted was the direction their force took . They were vectors , direction plus force , and that changed the whole world . " " That 's real news , " said Hendricks . " Quiet , " said Hondorp intensely . " What 's the applica-tion ? " " The application , " said Golk , with the shift to dignified warmth which always took Hondorp by surprise , " is this . Us . We . We 're the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vault the barrier , spring the cage . We 're going to instruct , reform . We 're going to be the education of the audience . Not the blackboard-and-seats kind , but demonstrators , dramatizers , the portrayers of corruption , connivance , of the tone and temper of the world they live in and do n't understand . " Golk looked Hondorp deep in the eye , digging for approval . He got but a ripple of puzzled surprise which he took  --  as he would have taken almost any reaction  --  for what he sought . Any reaction but the one which Hendricks supplied , which was " Bullshit . " " No , " he said patiently , quietly . " Not that at all . It 's not at all that . We 've been in cages too long , Jeanine . We 're not made to be just gawked at . Golked at , is what we want , studied , absorbed , remembered , acted upon . Is that right ? " No response . " We 're going to tap life out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and react in a way that 's different from the way they react to a play , or from the Kefauver hearings or from anything else , live or filmed , framed or off-the-cuff ,  |p110Chicago  style or the hillbillies . We 're getting out of the cages and going into the jungle . That 's where we live . " Hondorp shifted into the rarest of all his gears , interest . " I 'm going to take you seriously , Sydney . " Hendricks ' eyes widened . Few knew and fewer used Golk 's first name , and she watched to see Golk flinch , but he was nothing but the sculpture of attention , as absorbed now in Hondorp as he was in his scenes . Hondorp , committed now to scrupulosity and seriousness , realizing that this was the first moment of his life in which what he had to say might determine what someone else was to do , summoned his powers to make a resistance begun more on instinct than not , more as an expression of independencethan as an attempt to help his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His head steamed with concentrationas Golk watched him , still as a duck hunter in the marsh hearing the first small squawk , so faint he has not yet untied it from his expectation . " Television , " said Hondorp , " has all the marketplace attention it needs . That 's almost the condition of its existence . My view is that if you 've got some contribution to make to the medium , you do n't exploit the passive attention of the audience . Anybody can shock a baby , or a television audience . But it 's too easy , and the effect is disproportionate to the effort . If you want to contribute , you do n't move in the direction of simplifying , vulgarizing your talents in the hopes that you 'll accumulate a bigger audience , and a still more moronic one . No . You refine your talents , and either educate your loyal audience or work for a smaller and more critical one whose needs will drive you on to still greater accomplishments . That 's what happened in the Londonp111theater in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you got . . . " " Shakespeare , " said Golk , surfacing with a fish in his teeth . " Among others , " said Hondorp , holding the high line steady . " But sometimes you get someone like Tolstoi  --  " Golk clapped a fist into his palm and groaned . " What are you throwing Tolstoi at me for ? Let 's get back on dry land . " " These are just clear examples . " " Some examples . Why do n't you toss Jesus Christ at me ? This is modern times . We 're modern people with modern problems . " " Listen , " said Hondorp , firm , quiet , the village schoolmasterto his old pupil , now governor of the state . " Plants have roots and soil . Do n't throw out examples . Tolstoi had a talent , a big talent  --  " " Go on . Give me an education . " " A big talent that decided it was n't big enough , or at least was n't doing the right things , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Golk started to speak but met Hondorp 's raised palm . " I 'll tell you . For the rest of his life he was a character , a distinguished jerk , making everyone around him miserable , wife , children , friends , even his crazy disciples , an example which nobody serious followed or could follow , and which people paid attention to only because the example was the wreck of the great Tolstoi . " " Application ? " requested Golk , his mouth a points-down crescent . " Here , " said Hondorp , and he jabbed a forefinger toward his master 's nose . " There are two sorts of activity , two sorts of talents which move in two different directions . One facesp112the future , wants to rile its audience , and does so by **25;1843;TOOLONG , or other emotions which will only be released by some action the audience takes after it leaves the theater . These are the power men , and they 're committed to the future . Here 's the way things are , ' they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the others , the ones who last , the ones who face things as they are , and either reveal them with a perfection which satisfies even people who may be suffering similar things when they leave the theater , or who manufacture something which does n't seem to relate to any actual condition but which is itself so diverting , so pleasure-making that it becomes an object of permanentcontemplation , I mean one capable of being permanentlyenjoyed . " The waiter slipped into this tirade with three glasses filled with the lovely concoction Golk had suggested . " These men , " Hondorp went on , " face the present , and maybe the past , but in so direct a fashion that the future is assured to them without the ambitious itch driving them on to dubious assaults on a dubious future . My application ? Here : Try and be a big man in the marketplace , and you 'll end up chewing dirt , a Marx if you like with the boils of contradiction showing all over his work , his life and his face  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marketplace you take tremendous chances for precious little hope of success , and that 's because there , it 's the appearance rather than the actuality of worth that counts . That 's why it depends on the make-up man , the tin foil , the crazy lights . " Golk took this mouthful in with  --  on the whole  --  respectfulcare , and he nodded now gravely . " I do n't agree , Herbert , " he said . " I think I could even argue historically , though I do n't know too much there . I mean I think lots of writers like Swift in earlier times wrote to right certainp113abuses , and I believe they stand up well , but I 'm not going to try arguing that way because the way I feel takes care of the arguing . You see , I want to try this other . I want a taste of it , for its own sake first of all , and secondly because in my nose abuse and bad power and dumbness and harsh force itch and smell , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great blow at them . I 'm thinking this is the sort of thing we  --  the medium and us  --  may have been intended to do . How much real difference will there be between the sort of thing I 'm thinking about doing and what we have been doing ? " " You have n't briefed us on what we 'll be doing , " said Hendricks , contriving a yawn . " You 've been abstract , exclusively , or else very coy . " " Yes , " said Golk . " I 'll tell you , " and he drew out a sheet of his notebook paper , set it down beside his drink and read : People exist in our forced situations far more than they do outside of them . We rig the situation so that it can exhibit " That we 've heard , " said Hendricks , but Golk just shook his head and went on . There 'll be almost no essential difference in letting that situation be illustrative . All that we have to do is spell out what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in a purer sense , by using well-known people , or clearly defined types as victims , and familiar situations which are of public concern . When you show labor leaders and businesstypes in some sort of get-together  --  having a convivial dinner , say , then the conviviality has sinister overtones of public concern . We 're out to write the chapters in this bookp114of concern . " This is the way things really work , " we 'll be saying . " Look , listen , and do n't take the wooden nickels you see being made under the camera 's nose . " As Golk read , Hendricks uncoiled in her chair , and when he finished , she was shifting her head back and forth glaring like a rattler at him . Golk followed her with eyes bright as an infant making for a nipple . For a minute she just shook , and when she spoke , her voice was somewhere between cough and snarl . " So it really is something new for you this time . It 's not even just overreaching what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just lost all sense of the world around you . I love rebels . I 'm a professional rebel , but I 've got controls . I 'm aware of the world . Who would let you get a minuteof this on the air ? How could you keep out of jail a minuteif some of it did sneak through ? What do you think you are , The Dirty Drawers Digest ? Disguised as Political Science31 ? " Golk 's irises coursed back into the whites . The rebuke thundered at him from a Sinai he recognized . " Or is this a way out of what you 've been doing , an end with a big bang ? Baudelaire in the courts . If that 's your ticket , remember one thing : you 're not in this alone . A whole bunch of us are hanging on to you , and we 've been hanging on for no short period  --  keeping you on earth . What are you thinking of doing with us ? " For a moment it seemed as if Golk were getting up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his body until it gave the impression of being a tent over the table . " That 's enough , I think , " he said , and to her own surprise , she sat back . " Why a man should have to corral his own shadow , I don'tp115know , but I 'll make allowance for the sex of this one . " Hendrickswinced . " Do n't you think I 'm capable of thinking of what you think of ? And have thought of it ? Do n't you think I 've planned this caper ? You 've been with me long enough to know I do n't go shooting off skyrockets for fun . I 'm not in business to gratify my fantasy needs . If my stuff is n't on the TV sets , it does n't exist for me . The plan is clear as springwater , the network 's covered , the scenes worked out . It 'll take the big shot two weeks to know he 's been strewn over the country in ten million pieces . And as for releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , that is . This is a kind of newsreel . When you film a submarine sinking , you do n't have to get its permission to record it . " Golk worked himself up , raising eyebrows , waving fingers , his face brilliant in sympathetic illumination of his text , the professorwho gives his students something to look at as he expounds . It was a scene contrived for Hendricks and Hondorp , and even for Golk himself , who managed in this fashionto document his own insights . " We 're going to have to be subtler than the field snake , start slowly , creep up on them , make nothing too explicit , pretend to be doing news but just putting in the technical highlights which will make it clear the news is too new to be news , too private and too dirty . " Hendricks ' forehead creased as if an improper odor had circled the table . " So , " she said , " your lousy researchers were serious business after all ? " " They 've got four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the great reservoir of rancor , even more than New York . All those columnists buzzingaround stinging people into stories  --  worse than New York  --  and the power factions , the ins-and-outs , they 're allp116waiting to spill the other fellow 's guts . And our boys are out collecting . " " Sweet , sweet , " muttered Hondorp , halfway between disgustand relish . " It 's a uranium lode . I was down there maybe two days and my head was clicking like a Geiger counter at a ten-million-tonstrike . We 've already got three congressmen , the sister of a cabinet member , and a few of the industrialists , including  --  " and he hesitated here looking at Hendricks , " one of the big Greeks . " Hendricks , about to say something , held back . " How did you dig them up ? " asked Hondorp . " It 's not hard , " said Golk . " A letter of introduction here , a kind word there , and then it works like a magnet with iron filings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were breaking a track record . There 'll never be a scarcity of golks down there . The difficulty will be spacing them with the others . You ca n't just keep pounding away . That 's what these newspaper columnists do n't understand . They do n't vary the tone ; they 're always crying wolf . No , the principle must always be on top riding its illustration . We 'll have to watch out  --  that I know . On the alert , morning and night . There 's a fever here that gets you . I 'm trusting you two to see that it does n't get me , to keep me from blowing my stack over this stuff . If I 've been a little too pushy here , it 's because I 'm not entirely sure what I 'm doing . I need you to help me see it and do it . " He drew donkey ears in the wet ring his glass left on the table , and then sat back and looked out over the river , his features an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The appeal wrenched Hondorp 's reserve from him , and suddenly he felt a discharge of protective love toward Golk . " It 'll bep117all right , Sydney , " he said , the name coming out of him naturally , and from deeper inside than he would have suspectedwas possible . " Let 's go , " said Hendricks after watching Hondorp study the great head now almost lolling on the chair-back , as if it were about to be hoisted into place on the papier-mache trunk of a comic-opera monument . They got up . As they left Golk , walking through the restaurant 's genteel , polylingual fracas , the smells of Indonesian curry and Balkan goulash springing from silver plates to assert themselves like nations in the high , glistening room , they felt as if they were leaving a country which was in the realest sort of way their own , a union of interests that Golk 's lolling dome contained and stood for at the same time , the country , Golk , the flag , Golk , the capital , Golk , but feeling this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such allegiance . Out in the street , the local pressure of a New York summer relieved the pressure of Golk 's revelation and appeal . They started walking up Second Avenue , sweating happily , sweatingout Golk . In five blocks sweat and dust were their own oppression . " Let 's get the hell out of all this , " said Hendricks . Hondorp concurred with a nod . " Let 's celebrate , like folks celebrate . " Hondorp concurred again , without understanding . Hendricks took him by the elbow and led him out to a bar across the street . They had three brandy Alexanders apiece , then went on to the Music Hall , sat blankly through three hours of technicolor and the Rockettes , and moved onp118to the Villa d'Este for dinner . It cost Hondorp  --  who paid for it , no obstacle being interposed by Hendricks  --  forty dollars and a head afloat in boozy vertigo . It was Saturday night , and for the first time since his school days , he felt the week end as a gratifying institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a new scarlet moon . " My God , " said Hendricks firmly , " let 's scram out of this heat . " " Where ? " " We 'll drive up to Watch Hill . We can make it by mid-night . " Hondorp had never made so venturesome a journey , but he saw it as a natural part of the new order . " I 'll call my father , " he said . " Or should I go home and get some things ? " " Everything 's up there , " said Hendricks . " Just give him a quickie . " The idea , dipped in the liquor , came out looking newer than most ideas looked to Hendricks . " It makes me innocentjust to think of the ocean , " she said . " I 'm happy just thinking about it . " " You mean we do n't have to go ? " asked Hondorp , but she shoved him toward a drugstore , and he went in to make his call . That he took his father away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him away from speech itself . There was a riotous silence at the other end of the line into which Hondorp said three or four times , " Poppa , are you O. K. ? " Some garbled grunts issued over the line , and then a spate of German of which Hondorp made nothing . The boozy vertigo helped blunt his father 's anger . Indeed Hondorp was tempted to say , " Dry up , jerk , " but instead , atp119the first pause in the diatribe , he called , " Good night , Poppa , " and hung up . Hendricks drove a Bugatti 41 , a car which even on such avenues as Park and Fifth drew gratifyingly envious looks . The car was the same one her father had driven through the twenties and which , every two years , he 'd had dismantled and shipped off to the factory for check-ups from which the huge marvel emerged refreshed and resplendent . Hendricks drove the car all around New York , parked it in conspicuous places where it seldom failed to be submerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goggling , inscribeddelicate sentiments upon it with pencils , pens , chalk , and pointed stones . Hendricks had had the more delicate inscriptionsgilded with silver paint , and the car was now tattooed with a gleaming mass of obscenities . It had been the subject of a feature article in the Sunday Magazine Sectionof the Daily News . For Hondorp , the Bugatti was what a sign would have been to the generation of vipers : it affirmed the somersaultingof his old world , and constituted further invitation to the new dispensation . He was so struck by it as it was chauffeuredup to the front of the Ambassador by the garage man , that he said nothing , looked even as if it were not dissimilar to the cars he usually traveled in . Hendricks broke a rule about begging responses and asked him what he thought of it . " Quite spectacular , " he said with a shudder , and slid in next to her as a Baptist into a Roman Catholic pew . " You do n't like it ? " pursued Hendricks , ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like the spectacular , " said Hondorp distantly , " but it excites one . " He sat back while Hendricksp120drove , or rather exploded out of the city on the East Side Highway . They churned across to the Merritt Parkway and were past Westport before Hondorp said anything but " I have it " for the tolls . They were at Watch Hill by two o'clock , and drove along the ocean to a great house which stood on a grassy tip offshore . The moon gleamed enough to let Hondorp distinguishthe wind-darkened shingles , the nooks and crannies which were its ticket to the New England shore . There were no lights on . " They 're asleep , " said Hendricks , opening the unlatched door . The " they " conjured up Hondorp 's old suspicion , and he had a momentary spasm of vision , a husband and children hurtling down the stairs at him asking what he was doing there with wife and mommie . " Who are they ' ? " he asked . " Grandmother and a couple , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " " From what ? " wondered Hondorp , and then his eyes yawned moonsize at the apparent answer to the question . There in the foyer , Hendricks was taking off her clothes . Before he even imagined her naked , she was , softly angular , and more beautiful than he would have guessed from what he 'd seen of her , fuller , more graceful . " Undress , " she said . " We 'll swim New York out of us . " Hondorp obeyed , studiously , abstracted from old compunction . She took his hand and led him down a grass walk to a square of cold sand and into water so cold that he was yards in before paralysis wore off enough to let him yell . " Lip it up , " snapped Hendricks as the yell tore up the beach and she gave him an elbow which laid him out in the water . His skin turned inside out ; he nearly lost his head . Itp121was like being jammed into an iron maiden . He kicked out for dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . It was marvelous , the most ecstatic state he 'd ever sustained beyond spasm . Hendricks was in with him , and then she was swimming under him brushing his stomach and legs and genitals ; then she climbed on his back , and they rolled together trying to keep above water , and then sank together , rubbing against each other . They came out together and lay together on the sand , rubbing the gritty texture of their skins on each other , and then making love , with fury . Hondorp felt the top of his head sliding off . And the next thing he knew was total ease , the sense of a featheringsleep . The next thing was an ache in his side , something whackinghis ribs and the pressure of sunlight on his eyes . He shook himself , felt sand under him , made out a smooth brown stick with a rubber cap snapping back and forth against his side , and then , looking up , he saw a square , gray , female head , the lower half of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold pince-nez from which dribbled half a yard of black grosgrain . The diminished lower half was composed almost entirely of tooth fragments out of which he heard outraged questions about his existence and presence on the lawn . It was then that Hondorp realized he was naked , and he put his hands over his testicles and stammeredthat he 'd been swimming and had fallen asleep , please forgive him , he was a guest of Mrs. Hendricks . While the old woman took this in , he leapt up , ran into the house and into another female form in maid 's apron who screamed " George , " then upstairs where , on the first landing he saw Hendricks coming downstairs in Bermuda shorts and tailoredblue shirt.  | " Just get in , Herbie ? You must have jazzed up **27;1870;TOOLONG . Your stuff 's upstairs , second door on the left . Come on down for breakfast when you 're de-cent . " Hondorp , for a tempting second , saw his fist breaking her head open . Then he jumped upstairs , opened the seconddoor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what struck him now as a painfully unrumpled bed . He disengaged underwear from jacket and socks , dressed and then sat on the bed to contemplate his humiliation and the ocean . Then he went downstairs toward voices which came from a large screened-in breakfast porch . Hendricks and the Pince-Nez faced each other over Wheatena , kippers , and scrambled eggs . " Grandmother , this is Mr. Hondorp , " said Hendricks , sweet as early morningsun . The Pince-Nez extended a bediamonded set of fingers which Hondorp let touch his palm . " How do you do ? " the voice on the beach said as if it had never been a voice on the beach . " I 'm so glad you could come up for the day . " The prepositional phrase was isolated from the rest of the sentenceand frozen with injunction . " I so seldom see Jeanine now that she 's a woman of affairs . " The last three words sufferedsimilar isolation but were touched with an almost achingcontempt new to Hondorp 's palette of social tones . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hend  --  " " I 'm Mrs. Willoughby , " said the Pince-Nez , her tooth fragments reflecting the sun in such a way as to give the illusion of a smile and yet convey the coldness of Antarctica . Hondorp felt in the mixture a condemnation of his unpressedsuit , unshaven face , and  --  although he could hardly bear to think it  --  his uncovered testicles . " Jeanine is , I sup/pose , so unused to coming here now that she forgot to brief you on the ordinary details of our secluded life . " " Yes , " said Hondorp , " there are a number of precautions which she neglected to take . " " Eat up , dear , " said Hendricks sweetly . " Maybe we can have a swim or two before we head back . " " The water 's in the fifties , the low fifties , " said GrandmotherWilloughby . " I would n't counsel swimming . " " I 've already been in , " said Hondorp gently . " Last night . " " Oh , " said Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever drunk . " " I wonder how you could have survived then . One would think it would have knocked you out . " " Perhaps it did , Grandmother . Mr. Hondorp spent much of the night on the beach . " The outright rupture caused a moment 's silence which Mrs. Willoughby broke by rising and saying that she was going into Westerly to shop with George and , if they were still there , might see them for lunch . " She wo n't be back till she 's telephoned to find we 've gone , " said Hendricks the second Mrs. Willoughby left the room , but so loudly that there was little question of her havingoverheard each word . " Pleasant little family habits you have , Hendricks , " said Hondorp . " However , I 'd advise you not to screw around with me any more . " " A little joke like that cements friendships , Herbie . I could n't resist leaving you for Grandmother . She was the one I wanted to  --  to golk , not you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after weighing the matter , " but do n't use me as a prop again . "  |p124Their  eyes met over forkfuls of scrambled eggs and softened . " All right , " said Hendricks . " I never will . " They each hoisted a forkful of egg in a toast to their pact and alliance . When they drove back to New York after a morning swim , they had become as true friends as either of them had ever had.  |p125The  network debut was , as Variety headlined it , a " Sockeroo . " The Trendex was good and soon became tremendous , John Crosby wrote a laudatory column on the program 's comic freshness , which depended not on the eccentricity of a comedian or the absurdity of a situation , but on the commonfailings of us all , and other critics followed , Gould waxing philosophic about the approach and Shanley commendingthe technical inventiveness necessitated by the primitive equipment available for recording the scenes . The Luce magazines and Newsweek filled their television columnswith Golk , and Look and the Sunday Times Magazine Section commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rigorous respect of the agencies . Within two weeks of the debut comedians werep126doing take-offs on the program , and the word " golk "  --  in small letters  --  began appearing with its varied significations in editorial columns . Inquiring reporters for the New York Daily News , the Chicago Sun-Times , and the San Francisco Chronicle asked the same question in the same week : " What would you do if you found yourself golked ? " The answers ranged from a matronly " I 'd move out of Levittown like a shot , " to a witty " I 'd punch that Golk right in the gums . " The network arranged tie-ups with a toothpaste  --  " So you 'll look nice On Camera "  --  a beer  --  " Relax . Be natural for your golk "  --  and , in a spirit of racy fun , with a brassiere  --  " I wo n't be ashamed to meet my golk in a Prettiform Bra "  --  which was canceled before it got to the account executive 's office . Applications to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away each morning , unanswered . This was bad public relations but Golk 's word was , " They understand so chicken little about the program , let them fry . " The first two network shows were mild , traditional golks , businessmen watching their luncheons fractured by nosy waiters , men in subways finding themselves the objects of glamorous advances . The next two shows were tinted with the new style : the first had the vice-presidents of rival firms eating cordially together while speculating about the advantagesof each other 's jobs , being brought to this topic by Golk disguised as a potential customer ; the second , somewhat more " advanced , " as Golk had it , showed secretaries during a coffee break at the Senate Office Building pushed by Golk and Klebba into discussions of senatorial character . The latter stirred a bit of restless speculation in TV columns and in one or two of the national commentators , but only the golks themselves saw what was shaping up.  |p127During  this preparatory , softening-up period , Golk , despite the external bloom of his affairs , sulked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleshed his melancholy for the Times and Look articles did his eyes snap from the droop which , in his face , meant repression , suspension . The articles themselves , pasted snippets from the notebooks steeped in the high melancholy of Golk 's ambition , had , withal their wild raggedness , wide repercussions . The solemn thesis that " people come over best on the sort of show we work up , " was just the sort which the literary editors of dailies , weeklies , monthlies , and even quarterlies could blow into a big storm , and did . The articles were closely followed by the showing of the Dammer , Long , and Castelvetro golks , and then You 're On Camera became Golk 's dream of it , a national sensation . Mrs. James Dammer tried to keep out of her husband 's way , but it was difficult . He 'd had his biweekly hour with the President in the morning , and the self-deprecation such meetings involved exhausted his small stock of patience . Mrs. Dammer suffered him at lunch , played cribbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parsonage to him till three , and then nearly got away to go to the market when he said that he 'd like to go with her . " I have n't been shopping in years , " he said . " It might open my eyes a bit to see how much little things cost . " Mrs. Dammer trembled at the prospect . She urged her canary nose higher in the air and shook it a little . " You 'd just hate it , Jimmy . Even our little Georgetown market'sp128unbearable . People just push you along , snatch fruit out of your hands , drop things over your clothes , sneer at you . It 's really unbearable . " " You should send Burton , my dear . I had no idea . I ca n't imagine why you go . " " Mortification , " said Mrs. Dammer . " It 's a weekly mortification , though at times I can hardly sustain it even for that . " Dammer pinned his Angelico blue eyes to his wife 's . " To think how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an irony so slight only she would have caught it . " Yours in your little way , mine in mine . You 're spared nothing I 'm spared but the fearful consequences of your decisions . We suffer alike . " Mrs. Dammer touched a soft hand to her husband 's sandgraycrewcut , the feature which , with his large , tender eyes and plump cheeks , the cartoonists most sported with . " You 're too generous , dear . I ca n't see you wasting time with me , time the nation needs so much more than I. If I read of some emergency in the paper tomorrow , even if it were n't something that was your concern , I think I 'd just be miserableto think I might have been indirectly responsible for it . " " I 'll get my hat , Emily , " said Dammer springing from his chair with an old track-and-field man 's flicking grace . " We 'll ease each other 's burdens , and let the country take care of itselfthis afternoon . There are n't any indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Messina tonight . I 'm a free man , " he called from the door , salting the last with the much thicker irony which , at cabinet meetings , was his trademark . " Dammer does n't say much , but there'sp129always a twist to it , " the Vice President had been quoted as saying in a recent Letter from Washington . Mrs. Dammer sat back in the sofa . " Oh well , " she sighed , " He 'll be in Formosa Saturday , and then I do n't need to go tonight . In fact , I do n't remember being asked . Maybe they were working from an old list , " for the Dammers had been married , each for the second time , but two years ago , and not a few times since Dammer had been invited as an eligible widower to fill out  --  though with spectacular distinction  --  a table , usually at one of the older Washington houses . But being left out did not disturb Mrs. Dammer , for she could barely tolerate her husband at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session with the President . Dammerwas a notoriety at Washington parties , and considering that he drank little and never flirted , this was peculiarly rare . But then Dammer 's vice was peculiar , or rather , the extent to which he practiced a familiar Washington vice was . The vice consisted of not noticing , apparently not being able to notice any person who was not distinguished by either fortune , lineage , or position . At crowded parties , it was the sport of newspapermen , minor government officials , Committeecounsels , Supreme Court Justice clerks , charges d'affairesof the smaller Latin-American countries and the like to attempt to engage Dammer in conversation and to observe , and then later report on the machinations which extricatedhim from the ignominious encounters . He would spill drinks , suffer coughing fits , recognize old friends across the room , make for the bathroom , or simply lift his gray faun 's head above his assailant 's  --  he was very tall  --  and pucker up as if there were a mess of dead fish at his feet . Mrs. Dammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never deliberately without good manners , and her hus/band 's patent discard of them on such occasions caused her pain and humiliation . " What will he be like at market ? " she wondered as she pulled a bellcord to summon the chauffeur . But the marketing , to her immense relief , passed fairly easily . Aside from interrogating Frank , the grocer , about the wholesale prices and counseling him about his mark-ups , and from somewhat more elaborate interrogation of the only other customer in the store about her shopping habits ( " Do you buy seasonally ? " and " Do you try to have your family eat eggs and fish once a week ? " to which the answer was " I live alone if that 's all right with you " ) the expedition was unmarred by incident . Nonetheless , after a dinner which was consumed by the salted denunciation of an Assistant Secretary of Labor 's wife , and an hour of Pig during which Mrs. Dammer suffered a bloody nose when she jammed a finger into a nostril instead of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed by nine o'clock but almost ready for another session in her rest home . " Have a pleasant evening , dear , " she said , leaving her husband at the stairwell , " and do make my apologies . " " Good night , Emily , " he said . " If any Almanach de Gotha degenerate does anything unspeakable , I 'll save it for breakfast . " The tone was n't genuine : both the Dammers came from families which were neither provincial nor distinguishedenough to take any attitude toward European nobilitybut one of respect . He consulted his calendar , noted " WT " for " white tie , " dressed , called down for Burton , and was driven to Demicapoulis ' Chevy Chase mansion . The house was almost his chief interest in the soiree . Sincep131he had personally uncovered the arrangement whereby the Greek was reselling to the government what had been its own scrapped property at a four thousand per cent profit and had hastily plugged the gap ( or tried , as a matter of fact , for the Greek had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomely ) , the Greek had remade what had been an inconspicuous fifteen-room British EmbassyAnnex into a forty-room monster , buying up fifteen houses on either side which he razed and converted into thick lawn . His profits from the scrap venture were said to have been almost entirely invested in the project . The car drove up an alley of cypress ( brought in from Florence in gigantic freezers it was said ) , through a gate at which he had to be identified by a guard ( " This is probably against the Alien Property Act , " muttered Dammer , " maintaininga foreign troop outside of embassy grounds , " and he decided to have this checked on ) , to an immense spread of yellow stone which struck Dammer as being extraordinarily ill-lit for a great fete . He was somewhat reassured by a line of chauffeured limousines on an adjacent green and an operatic-lookingfootman standing under the lighted center door . A similar form opened the car door , another the front door , and inside he was told by a butler that His Highness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't quite catch on to Washington procedure , these lesser royalties , " thought Dammer as he went by himself across a large , dimly lit receiving hall into the room toward which he 'd been directed . " Can I be so early ? " he asked himself . There were less than ten people clumped in the center of a tremendous circular room , brilliantly lit in the middle , infernally black elsewhere . Dammer shivered for a second , and almost turnedp132around to go back when a figure detached itself from the clump and called across the forty feet of polished floor , " Come join us here , do . " Dammer 's head arched for a moment on his neck , but as there was no one close enough to him to stare over , he made his way to the group . There were four women ( one a Negress or Indian ) dressed , amazingly enough , in identical yellow evening dresses , and all wearing what seemed to be great sapphires in their ears . There were five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and **28;1899;TOOLONG who had called to him . The men were dressed in business suits . " How do you do ? " asked the man with the whiskers . " I 'm Rinaldo . " " How do you do ? " Dammer managed . " I 'm James Dammer . I wonder if I 've come to the right place . " " Demicapoulis ' , " said the other . " Lent to me , the Duke of Messina , for a few months ' stay . Very handsome of him . " " It is the right place then , " said Dammer . " I 'd understood there was to be a large party here . " " Just some friends , " said the Duke . " The large party is next Tuesday , I think . " " Ahh , " said Dammer , more relieved than embarrassed . " Then I 've intruded . I 've made a mistake , or my secretary has . It 's very rare . I trust that you 'll forgive me . Perhaps you 'll let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to go . " Please do stay , Mr. Dammer . Meet my friends and have some vin de Messine . We make it ourselves . Let me present you to everyone , " and the Duke unloosed a series of garbled names which with one or two exceptions clinked with the syllables of nobility " Delighted , " said Dammer . " It 's really a relief to be onep133of a small party when one has anticipated a mob . Especially after a day such as I 've had . " " Ah , you 've had a difficult day , you poor man , " said a tall blonde in a seductive , gently foreign voice . " I hope nothing disastrous has happened . " " Nothing like that , " said Dammer smiling , and noticing that the others were giving him complete attention . " A conferencewith the President usually makes me tense . " " Yes , he 's an intelligent fellow , " said a dark , sour-looking man . " That 's true as well , " said Dammer hesitatingly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine  --  one 's knowledge that as one presents , at last , long-cherished and carefully worked-out plans , it is the point of no return . There can be no more wobbling or hesitation . The Presidentrelies on one ; you have an hour to make your report , and the next hour may see it turn into  --  well , you can imagine . And how do you find the United States these days ? " he went on more or less to the blonde and without the slightest tonal indication of the topical switch . " Uninteresting , " was her response , uttered in a somewhat different accent , which only deepened Dammer 's discomfort . " And may I ask , " he went on , " whether the charming dresses you and the other ladies are wearing are some sort of uniform , a caste mark of some sort ? " " We got them wholesale , " said the Negress . " Ha ha , " was Dammer 's response . " Glad you like them , Senator , " said the blonde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life , and said that , unfortunately , he was not and had never been a senator . Dammer had had onep134fling in politics : his St. Louis law partner had garnered organizationalsupport for him after he and Dammer had won a famous case , and Dammer campaigned for the senatorial nomination . He had been beaten by a folksy war hero in the most one-sided primary victory in Missouri history . Dammercould not see his old rival 's name in print without feelingnauseous . The word " senator "  --  despite the long , inuringyears in Washington  --  had some of the same incantatorypower , which even now , in the presence of foreigners who could be presumed not to know of the humiliating campaign , spilled anxiety into Dammer 's eyes . Dammer himself was the only one who realized that the fetishistic sensitivity was at the root of his celebrated party manner . The fatal instinct of women  --  this was Dammer 's view of it  --  drove the tall blonde toward agonizing exploration of the infected tissue . " I 'm somewhat relieved at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accent now being a three-syllable pronunciation of the past participle . " Would it be unkind of me to say that the quality of the American legislators is at times something to be deplored ? " As long as the terrible subject was pursued , thought Dammer , it was at least being pursued in the right direction . " It might not be too disloyal of me to say that there have been times when I 've felt the same way about this matter as you , Countess , " said Dammer , the title coming to his lips although he 'd been given no reason to use it . " Mmm , " was her response , and it was accompanied by a head motion that seemed noble , indeed regal , beginning as it did at her eyebrows and ending not much below them . " There are indeed what I might call actual roughnecks in the great chamber . " Dammer followed this curve and nodded , unsure whetherp135he should relax and give vent to his spleen or divert the conversationfrom what could turn out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided it for him : the very name of his personal nemesis was in the air . The strange blonde spat it out of her mouth with a distaste that to Dammer seemed an articulate version of that which he had publicly suppressed for a decade . " And he has such a following here , " she went on , bringing Dammer 's heart around her words and stretching it painfully . His head started arching , the instinctivemove toward freedom , but there was nowhere to go here . They were islanded , the two of them , in a strangely large and powerfully illuminated island of attention . At his breaking point , Dammer burst out , " In our country , Countess , a certain brand of viciousness has always enjoyed a remarkablewelcome . Vulgarity to the vulgar , baseness to the base . The mob smells the wolf which stinks of rotten meat and they 're transfixed by the smell . Yes , " he went on , his great blue eyes rolling slightly in the gray , impeccable face , " the rotten meat draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dammer remarked a vast envelope of silence , felt the steam of arc lights bearing on his head . " Have I said too much ? " he asked himself looking at the wise looks of the foreigners enclosing him , feeling in a minute that more than their observation was pressing him . Suddenly there was a stir in the black periphery of the room , and Dammer turned to see moving toward him out of the dark what at first seemed to him the incarnations of a nightmare , large , many-eyed monsters which , as he watched , battered with astonishment , turned into large cameras Jolliedout by men in slacks and sport shirts . Now he saw that the mysterious illumination came from immense stage lights fixed to long curving poles , and that the people who corn/posed the island of attention were now but smiling individualsrelaxed out of foreign postures into what were to Dammer clear American types , that the large-domed Duke of Messina was pulling off his sidewhiskers and saying in the most American of voices , " You 're On Camera , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next seconds were the longest in Dammer 's life . " Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , " he managed to get out then . " Ha , ha , ha . Marvelous . Wonderfully funny , " he pushed out of the river of sand which was his throat , and he clapped Golk on the shoulder to keep from keeling over . And then he was gone , though , with remarkable strength , he turned once at the door to call back , " Good game . Swell fun . Good night all . Good night . " It was a wonder to all who knew anything about George Armbruster Long that he had managed to stay in Washingtonso long , let alone in positions of some influence , if little authority . Long was not yet fifty , but he had been in official Washington for nearly thirty years . He had arrived directly after flunking out of the University of Virginia in his junior year . He had made up for this difficult achievement by marryingthe only daughter of a brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Washington , as if to compensate for his Charlottesville career , he becamesomething of a student . The new political orders of the twenties and thirties became his passion , and the newer they were , the more passionate he was about them . Of the very newest , German National Socialism , he became one of thep137first American apostles ; in fact , early in 1935 he addressed a letter ( on official stationery ) directly to Hitler , in which he made application for a post in the German government . " Any position in which I can be of service will do , " he wrote , although he suggested that his experience in Washington might qualify him for one in the American Affairs Section of the Auslandsabteilung . ( Except for this word , the letter was in English ; there were limits to George 's studies . ) Four months later , he received an answer which his father-in-law 's German maid translated for him . It was a short note : " The Fiihrer , Herr Hitler , appreciates your interest in German affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff is complete . " Two months later , George , on fire with old errors and new passion , wrote to Moscow . The response to this was less remote . A month later , a hand poked itself out of a Ford coupe in front of his apartment building and waved at him . George approached , was told to get in , did , and was driven down to the Union Station car lot . The driver was a man of fifty dressed in an old tweed topcoat buttoned from chin to knees . At the station , parked in the middle of a row of cars , the man turned to him , transformed , his timidity shed along with ten or fifteen years , his topcoat unbuttoned enough to reveal the glint of a uniform . " You wrote a letter to Moscow on March 19 last ? " he asked . " Yes I did , " said George . " I gather it arrived . " " Correct . The question is , How serious was the letter ? ' We 've looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be either a prankster or an agent , but we do n't see that you 're a Marxist either . Are you a fool ? " " No , " said George sincerely , but saying it , he began feelinga disturbing discrepancy between the nature of the ques/tion and his own passion for social justice and unsentimental revolution . The hard , querulous head sticking up out of the ambiguous glint , the rows and rows of cars , these worked in him depression , whereas his emotional goal was elation . " But I 've changed my mind since the letter , " he went on . " I 'm going to be a student of Soviet affairs , not an active participant in them . " The topcoat was rebuttoned , the face aged , and timidity oozed back into it . The door was opened and George refrainedfrom asking what he wanted to ask , which was , " Could you drive me to the Carlton ? " During the next few years , George shifted from CongressionalCommittee to Committee , usually as a researcher or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the President and left Washington to become an executive with a Southwestern oil company . George went along to Dallas , and stayed to learn the rudiments of the oil code , and much more than the rudiments of what oil men needed from Washington . He returned to the city as a registered lobbyist , and for the next few years performed easy tasks with easy charm . He made money enough to take care of what were never extravant needs , and then he began to itch again for government life and power . He took a minor post in the Treasury Department and from here worked himself over to the Petroleum Section of the State Department , which is where he was at Pearl Harbor . Then , despite his departmental exemption , he chose the path of valor , and was commissioned a staff officer assigned to PetroleumAffairs with G-2 in Washington . After the war , he moved back across the Mall to the Department . Here he stayed through two Democratic and one Republican administration , although , in the latter , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of the second term , the wind whistled with perilous precision : he had written a memo on tidelands oil which had close verbal resemblances to the brief of one of the unsubtler lobbyists , and only the pressure of the coming campaign diverted seriousattention from him and it . But he knew that he was trembling on the razor 's edge , and he began coasting around for an area of extra-governmental repose . Now , in late June , he felt that he was on to something . A representative of the great shipping magnate , Demicapoulis , had come to him with a suggestion that he might act as liaison man between Demicapoulis and the Texas oil firm with which he had been associated to work out a tanker arrangement . ( George was somewhat surprised at the particularoffer , since he had been one who had advocated a " crack-down " policy on Demicapoulis in the affair of the resaleof government property to the government ; still he thought it unlikely that this fact was widely known . ) On Tuesday he lunched with Demicapoulis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great bald head and a thick , red , almost artificial-looking mustache . They met at Theopopos ' suite at the Mayflower . George reviewed his whole career under the pressure of the cautious Greek , and then declared what he thought official policy would be toward the arrangements . The interview , held in the marvelouslybright suite , went swimmingly . Andrea " Dove-Eyes " Castelvetro , muscleman turned negotiatorand headed for the top of his profession , was just backp140from a difficult Washington session with a Senatorial subcommitteewhen a phone call from the Atropos Shipping Line opened up to him a prospect so lush that the strain of endless reiterations of " I must respectfully decline to answer on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate me " passed from his handsome face and deposited there instead that seraphic , forward look which had gained him his familiar nickname . For four years he and his concern had been vainly trying to work out an agreement with Atropos , only to be foiled by a large , and spectacularly well-armed local union devoted exclusively and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the management . Now , according to Theopopos , the company 's new representative , the cost of that exclusive devotion had reached the point where it was less expensive to make the standard working agreement with Castelvetro 's union . The preliminary meeting was to be held on Theopopos ' yacht anchored across from the great Joseph Kennedy yacht in Oyster Bay . ( This juxtaposition was taken by Dove-Eyes as a wonderful bit of play in view of his recent interrogation by Kennedy 's son . " I never been easy with Greeks , " he told his driver on the way out to Long Island , " but they got a great nose for humor . " ) Down at the harbor , he put on the commodore 's cap he had been instructed to wear , brushed specks of car lint off the fifty-dollar white flannels he 'd bought for the outing , and after making the signal , two taps of the cap 's visor , got into a motorboat and was driven out to the yacht , a seventyfootpower boat that  --  he was piqued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out than his own boss 's boat . Theopopos , a strange-looking fellow who looked strangely familiar to him , helped him up on deck and walked him around to thep141quarterdeck where under the hot sun was a table laid out with caviar , sturgeon , and champagne . " A good way to have a conference , " said Castelvetro with the amiability which had lifted him so rapidly from the ranks of the musclemen . " That 's the way we operate , " said Theopopos , " the way we always want to operate . " " No reason why not , " said Castelvetro , meeting the byplaywith his usual agility . Theopopos nodded sweetly and suggested that they get right down to work . Through their huddled heads , the bare rigging of the Kennedy yacht shifted easily in the sun . The reactions to the three great golks of Stage Five brought smiles even to Golk 's face . Every newspaper report , every commentator 's spiel , sank a new well of satisfaction deep insidehim , and for days he did little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam more . When the Times reviewed the three golks , showing how the public image of Dammer , the unruffled advisor extraordinary , lay shattered before the presentation of his prissy snobbishness and awkward , malicious innocence , and wondered in the cloister of the editorial page about the thirty-year tolerance of Long 's uncamouflaged finagling and Castelvetro 's unsheathedcorruption , Golk saw the certification of his program'spower . Other issues were raised simultaneously by the newspapers and by public figures : these concerned the propriety , even the legality of You 're On Camera 's exposure.  | " What triumphs , " Golk murmured sweetly , the day after the Castelvetro golk . " The Telegram says some congressman'sbrewing a bill to outlaw us . He 's going to talk to the President about it . " " What 'll this do to us ? " asked Hendricks . Golk looked up from the newspapers and shook his head . " We 'll take it to the courts as the freedom of the artist to presentthe world in his own terms . It 'll be a case for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth on . Listen to this bilge , " and he drew out the editorial page of the New Orleans Press-Dispatch and read it out a la Gabriel Heatter . What was a fictional nightmare in the pages of NineteenEighty-Fourhas become reality . A reality that proves , however , to be more garish a nightmare than even George Orwelldescribed . Orwell pictured a world in which men were constantly spied upon by the secret police of a super-state . On the Parisak Network , a New York comedian with the improbable name of Golk displayed not to the secret police but to the entire nation  --  or , at least , to that large portion of it which is watching his sensationalist program  --  the privatebehavior of individuals , individuals who are sometimesmen of international importance . Their behavior is under none of the constraints which awareness of being spied upon put upon the behavior of people in the Orwell state , and thus what the world sees reeks of the jungle . At the conclusion of his programs , Mr. Golk appears before the camera to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're On Camera . ' " Our reaction to this is one of rage . So serious an invasion of private life has probably never beforebeen held over the heads of Americans . Golk appears before us as a comedian . It seems to us high time that we took him very seriously indeed.  | " Improbable name , " snapped its possessor . " Hopheaded hypocrites . Half their waking hours are spent rooting out the world 's dirt , getting their mangy stories , pumping the news out of everybody 's guts , and the rest of the time they complain about people who really turn the insides out . " But the smile spoke for the bliss which he lapped up from the editorial . " Do n't tread air , Golk , " said Hendricks who was writhing in the display of self-gratulation . " You know what the Greeks said . " " Demicapoulis ? " said Golk . " Do n't be a dope . He 's so nuts about what we 're doing he can hardly contain himself . We shipped him another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gift of God , Jenny , and that old letter of yours opened him up for us . I owe you for that . " " I 'm not talking about that thief , " said Hendricks , wound up even more by Golk 's hurtling ignorance . " I mean the ones who said , Pride goes before the big fall . Do n't crow on the dunghill . ' I 'd watch it , Golk . I smell conse-quences . " Golk 's great head seemed to let air ; the seams showed and he spoke softly , gently . " Let me rant a little , Jenny . It 's the way I relax . We 've had a long haul uphill . Of course , there 're going to be consequences . What 's the point of doing anythingif it 's not going to have consequences . " Half under his words , she said , " I know . You fish to eat . " " They 're not going to let us go on like this for long . I'maware of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butmeanwhile we 'll have done a noble stint , a clean job . Somethingnobody 'll ever take away from us . I 'm proud of thesegolks . They were hard to assemble , harder to pull off , butp144we worked them . So let me crow a little . If I 've got the surplusenergy to do that , it 's not going to kill anyone . " Golk crowed for a few more days . More than crowed . As a manic fit comes on , pools of energy blasting out in the body , drumming joy in the head until the world looks all bright , all yours , so Golk pranced high surveying studio and city . While crowds looked on and newsreel cameras followed , he led the golks on a tour of the city monuments , and had Fitch take Aunt-Mary-shots of him with them . His great head blotted out the Statue of Liberty 's , blew crumbs to pigeons on St. Patrick 's steps , dangled in mock terror from the Observation Tower of the Empire State Building , kissed Washington 's foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Park seals goggled with desire , rubbed noses with movie blondes in the Colony , imitated a screaming horse before the Museum 's Guernica , ducked fly balls during batting practice at the Polo Grounds , and everywhere , talked and talked and talked , about the city , the weather , the sights , the condition of men and business , the purpose of entertainment , the art of television , and the universe of golkdom . In these days he seemed almost never to be still : legs and arms and mouth kept in motion as if future motion depended on never stopping . Then , he relaxed , and went back to the office to review the Stage Four golks they were using to bridge the explosions . He was just about to head out for a cruise in Oyster Bay ( Demicapoulis had put his yacht at Golk 's disposal for the summer ) when Hondorp jogged into the cave flapping a piece of paper topped by a golden " P. " " It 's all over , " he said mournfully . Golk took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told you they digested novelty like sick elephants . Itp145must have been that forty-five Nielsen that held them back this long . " " Castelvetro and Long have five-million-dollar suits filed  --  " Golk coughed up a huge laugh . " They do n't have a leg to piss on . " " Lurcher says Parisak is going to settle with them for half a million apiece and is going to make a public apology for the golks . On network . On Golk time . Dammer has the FCC looking at the network charter . " Golk 's head rocked back and forth like a sick bell-clapper . " The battle of the giants , " he said after a minute . " Well , we waved that old lion by the tail longer than most . " " Where do we go from here , Sydney ? " asked Hondorp sitting on his corner of the desk . " I wonder , " said Golk . " I take it they want to inspect our films before we put them on the air . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do the Yankee  --  Kansas City one before we folded . Well , we 'll just do some old-style golks , take the rating loss , and wait for the ax . Or we could go ahead and make a few whoppers , and just hold off with them until someone with guts started up a network which 'd just tell everyone to go screw themselves . " " Are you joking ? " " Ruminating . " Hondorp flapped the paper back and forth . " The sentenceof death . " " Not so gloomy , Herbert . Even in our time , they ca n't keep a good man down . " This earned the sort of laugh he usually solicited in vain . " No . If they renew  --  " " If they renew . "  | " If they renew , we 'll do a series of quiet , well-made affairs , and then , just kind of by accident , when nobody 's looking , we 'll slip in a bomb or two , and then cart the heads out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curtain speech to the effect that when the dead did n't know they were buried , it was time for the living to clear out . But Golk was out of things now , his head lolling back against the chair rest . After a few seconds in which Hondorp paid it the familiar respects of contemplation , he went out for a drink and conference with Hendricks . Or started out the building at any rate , for the way was blocked by a raucous embolus of photographers flashing cameras , hurling orders and questions , all in the tone of insult and assault which gave them the collective identity of a species known and reviled over the earth . " It 's our own medicine , " said Hendricks . " Except that here it 's the disease . " Hondorp paused to give his face to a few million readers before ducking back in the building for the Bacardi in Hendrick 's desk . They sat by a window overlooking the steaming miles of Queens across the river . Rising in the heat , the injured colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with the objects on which they existed ; to Hondorpthe view was that of an endless canvas by Pollock or de Kooning , and with even less relationship to life . They drank the Bacardi from eighteenth-century Baccarat glasses Hendrickshad taken from Watch Hill . " Well , here 's to Golk , " said Hondorp , ticking her glass at the third refill . " Got what he was looking for , " said Hendricks.  |p147Her  gold head outlined against the suffering canvas of the city was the only thing in the universe clear to Hondorp . " That 's supposed to be good , " he said . " If you know what you 're looking for , " she said , watching him watch her , and letting the rum rest and glisten on her lips for his pleasure . " I know what I want , " he said firmly and touched her knee with his palm . " That 's too easy , " she said , " and I 'm too tired to dance on a coffin . " " We 're exaggerating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ours . The coffin of the program . He 's right about keeping the good man down . There are n't enough around to bury him . It 's us , his format , that are on the lip of hell . " " And just as I was beginning to like it all , " said Hondorp , his vertigo dipped now into gloom . It was true . Hondorp had eaten it up , publicity , flashbulbs , and all . The total reversal of his obscurity , the grotesqueextrapolation of his choice tickled him no end . His father goggling at Page One of the morning Scripture , the interviews , all had assured him , " You 're alive . They care for you . They want you . " He toyed with the sensational world , provided bait for it . At the airport the other day , he had made an arm-in-arm exit with Elaine through a canopy of bulb-flashes , gone into a taxi with her , and while the bulbs popped off the taxi windows , put his tongue into her mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her . He had brought her home to dinner , his game with himselfbecoming then a game with that minuscule section of the public constituted by his father . As it was every evening now , his approach to the apartment building had been a tri/umphant entry . The doottnan waved aside three autograph hounds and then applauded with the elevator operators as he entered . Because of Hondorp , the house was the talk of the street : " Hondorp , one of Golk 's top assistants , lives here . " Elaine was recognized as having been touched with the same magic , and the fact that she had been more than touched with the tar brush , in a house and along an avenue in which the only such specimens wore uniforms , was nothingalongside the fire of such celebrity . For Poppa Hondorp , the presence of a guest at dinner was the overriding fact . It had not happened for years , and never as far as his son 's friends were concerned . ( There were none to invite . ) The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic an embroidery of the initial fact that it took him to the middle of the salad to register it , and , by then , he had grown accustomed to Elaine as guest , his son 's colleague and fellow celebrity , and , as much as his limited capacity enabled him , as a person . For someone who had never entertained a Negro or treated one as a patient , it was a surprising adjustment . " Have you been down in Florida , Miss Parsons ? " he 'd put to her between forkfuls of vinegar-soaked lettuce . " We do n't have time to travel , Doctor . Working for Golk is a full-time job and then some . " " You must be one of the fortunate New Yorkers who have sunbathing terraces , " he pursued . " Oh no , " said Elaine . " This complexion is natural . " " I see , " he said slowly , eyes widening . " Well , it 's just one of those things . You 're a fine girl anyway . " Hondorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began looking forward to the other joy Elaine would provide . Since his first night with her , he had enjoyed whatp149were to him the more spiritual gifts of Hendricks , but the prospect of another session with Elaine was , he felt , a prerequisiteto continued existence . Though this feeling had started at the airport when he saw Hendricks giving him the eye and saw that the eye was stiff with commanding authority , his need was more than the counter to that bold advance . Hondorp had become a minor master of the strategy , " Want not , be wanted , " and though he enjoyed the power over Hendricks this strategy gave him at the airport , here at the table watching Elaine parley with his father , he knew there were grander strategies , ones which overrode the others as tanks do butterflies . " What is your reaction , " his father was asking Elaine , " to being a public figure ? " " I can , " she said sweetly , " take it or leave it . " Poppa Hondorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a consultant who disagreed with his colleague 's diagnosis . " I suppose you people develop your splendid equilibrium in the practice of your art . I 've often noticed how much Herbert has learned about controlling his feelings . I envy you . " " He 'll be learning a lot more in the next few weeks . " " Ah so ? " " What 's that mean ? " asked Hondorp . " Wait and see , " she said purring . " Do n't be an ass . " " Darling , " reproached Poppa Hondorp , a gentleman of the old school . " Well ? " pursued Hondorp . " Well , hon-heart , " said Elaine in a tone whose warmth caused Poppa Hondorp to blush . " Nobody can sus-tain it fawever . Get it ? " Hondorp indicated coldly that he did not.  | " I mean us goiks are on top of the world now , but we ca n't stay there . Something 's got to give , and when that happens , we 're going to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Parsons , " said Poppa Hondorp , his forehead losing the lines that had striped it when he had seen Elaine 's tone in its true but to him incredible implications . " Everything in the world changes , affections , infections , defections , resurrections , everything , and from every change , one can derive knowledge , and at the end of knowledge is wisdom . " " That is it , Doctor , " said Elaine heartily , and she reached over to pat Poppa Hondorp 's hand . As if it were a game , he covered hers with his other hand . " I would n't put it past her , " thought Hondorp , detecting in the spot of drool at the corner of his father 's smile a reactionnot unrelated to that which Elaine 's tone and manner generated in him . After his portion of coconut and sliced orange had gone the disturbed route of the pot roast and potato pancakes , he announced that he and Elaine would forgo the evening in front of the machine extended to them by Poppa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to his father . " Do n't show off , " said Elaine in her parodic manner . " Let 's go , " said Hondorp with threat in his voice , put there to excite rather than scare Elaine . The device served : she rose and thanked Poppa Hondorp for the lovely dinner . Poppa Hondorp cast a quick look at his pocket watch , saw that the two minutes which intervened between Gleason and Caesar would go to the sponsors and so gallantly devotedthem to praise of Elaine , dinner guests in general , and " the art to which you and Herbert are giving yourselves . " An hour or so later , at the hotel , after giving themselvesp151to the first stage of a less recondite art , Elaine asked Hondorp whose side he was going to be on . " What does that mean ? " he asked feebly . He was flopped , arms straight back behind his head , feet tumbled on each other , barely energetic enough to relish Elaine 's pressed fingers against his stomach . He vaguely hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might disable him for years . " What we were talking about at your Daddy 's house . " " Before or after your attempt on him ? " " Do n't be an old prune now , Hondie . I mean the pro-gram . " " I do n't get you then . " Elaine lay back on him , reaching out her arms to cover his , capping his knees with the bent joints of her own , lettingher head fall back so that her cheek was against his . After the adjustment , she said , " I should n't care , I suppose . After all , whatever happens , there 'll always be room for me , do n't you think ? " Hondorp said he was sure of that . " But I care for old Golkie in my way . " " So ? " " Well , you do n't need to be old Dunninger to understand what 's going to happen to him . " " What does one need to understand you ? That 's my problem , " said Hondorp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Elaine lightly shifted her backside across him . He wrapped his arms around her and began a slow , complex massage . " You 've got it , Hondie , " she said writhing in a still more complex massage of her own . Almost entirely revived , Hondorp still held off longp152enough to ask what was going to happen to " old Golkie . " The answer , however , was lost to him as Elaine loosed a blast of passion that rocked him senseless till the gray morninghour when he staggered into a cab outside the hotel and , parrying the cabby 's questions about his connection with Golk , the doorman 's respectful salute , and the elevator man 's request for a pass to the show , opened the apartment door and let himself into bed for a twelve-hour sleep.  |p153By  the tenth week of the thirteen-week option run , Golk had received no word at all about the renewal of the contract . The program itself was running smoothly  --  there were no further golks about national figures or situations  --  and its audience ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were in the early weeks . The golks were oldstyleones , and were made with Golk 's usual care . A morningscreening was held before each telecast , and Lurcher , as network inspector , took over Golk 's armchair ( Golk himselfdid n't appear ) and nodded at the conclusion to signify that no changes need be made . He never said a word about Golk 's future , and Golk did not bother to ask him or anyone else . It was bruited about town that Parisak had settled damagep154suits by Long and Castelvetro out of court , and that he had dissuaded the latter to keep his thugs off Golk . A contrary rumor was that Long and Castelvetro had paid the network a substantial sum to destroy the kinescopes of the program . A third rumor was that Parisak had asked Castelvetro 's hoods to " get Golk , " but that the latter had refused because his amiable appearance on the network had bolstered his status with the union . Parisak was known to have gone to Washington to talk to Dammer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smear campaign to dislodge Dammer 's nemesis from his senatorial seat in return for release from the inquisitorial grip of the FCC . These rumorsreached the golks through items in gossip columns and talk , not through the network where it was felt that such speculation was dangerous . ( It was generally believed that Parisak not only had the entire building bugged , but that he 'd had his engineers develop some sort of **26;1929;TOOLONG registered the vibration of treasonable thoughts . ) The golks went about their jobs more or less relieved of the tension which the initial burst of publicity imposed on them , but relations were strained . Even as they tried to act in the old way with each other , the knowledge that their actions had been and were in small part still an object of curiosity to millions altered the actions and deformed the relationships and feelings which engendered them . For Golk himself , the strain was a condition he regarded as a test , and one which he could survive better than those who were directly or indirectly responsible for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign press and intellectual quarterlies had taken him up  --  and with the planning and shooting of the golks , but the activity was likep155that of an unsuccessful candidate for the Presidency in that it had the tone of aftermath . Whatever feelings Golk had about restoring the program to its brief and glorious positionas a maker as well as recorder of history he kept to himself . Now and then Golk felt that there were too many balls in the air and that if he had to keep flinging and catching them he would go off his rocker . In that tenth week he took off the first day he 'd taken since he 'd come to New York . The faces of the goiks , the chairs , the rooms , the props , the objects which stood there as the by-products of his will seemed to him its incarceration . He was weary in a way he had never been before , not as the letdown after triumph or reaction to temporary disappointment or sickness , just weary of purposefulactivity . He called Hendricks and Hondorp over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , will you ? I 'm taking the day for myself . I 've got to think . " " So , " thought Hendricks . " There are cracks in it after all . " " O.K. , " she said aloud . " You deserve a little time off . " " Time off , nuts , " said Golk . " Life does n't have such a commodity for the serious , " but the response struck him himself as an old record . He had the sense that time was cluttered with his impatience , that he had spilled himself out for years and years and that there had to be an end to the spilling . He got up without saying anything more and walked by them out of the studio . Elaine was having a soda in the Whelan 's across the street , and for a moment his feelings bunched for a leap in that direction . He 'd slept a few times with Elaine , and prized her for the special sensation supplied . In bed she exuded pleasure in a fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it wasp156what he remembered more than the breathing fruit of her body . He thought of it as he watched her with a blob of strawberry ice cream at her lips , and then he matched it against his present need and found no correspondence . " What is it I want ? " he wondered , and he walked down toward the river , and walking , found out part of what it was : motion itself , undirected , needless motion , unattachment . It was the coolest day of the summer . Golk seemed to feel his brain , his whole apparatus of intellection , spine , body nerves , sense pockets , open , detached from the denuded sense of movement , weightless now of plans , worries , conceptions , just touched here and there with street forms , sun , breeze , the sidewalk at his soles . He walked to the Roosevelt Drive and leaned against the paling , looked across at the Queens factories , the fragile slab of the Secretariat Building , the cars moving in the Drive and the bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golk was used to fixing on detail . The lives in each car , on each floor of each building merged for him now , and it was in becoming aware of the merger , the momentary abandonment of his outlook that he returned to it . " I ca n't make it as a mystic , " he told himself ; but the appetite for the general had worked in him , and since he 'd given himself the day , he pursued it . He walked to a garage on Second Avenue , took out his long blue Ford convertible , went up the Drive and then out into Long Island . He drove for nearly three hours in and out along the shore , past the Hamptons and then into the easternmost inlets . Past a stretch of flatlands , he saw a small beach , gray and miserable in the late afternoon light . A hut was built up against a small wharf at the end of which ap157man sat on a stool leaning toward the water into which he dangled a line at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Golk 's eye took it in with pleasure ; he wished he 'd brought a camera . He got out of the car and walked the hundred yards from the road to the wharf . " How do you do ? " said the man without turning around . " What do you want ? " " Just to talk , " said Golk , and he got up on the wharf which shook at his weight as if it had been constructed for its present tenant alone and resented any extension of its usefulness . The man aimed at him a long angular head dangling from a mop of black hair . " Fine , " he said . " Talk away , but you 'd better get off the wharf . Sit on the beach . My name 's Farrow . David Farrow . Mean anything to you ? " " It 's a nice name , " said Golk , " but you do n't look Egyptianto me . " He laughed , but , as usual , laughed alone . " Mine 's Sydney Pomeroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Golk stepped off the wharf . " Why should your name mean something to me ? " The man drew the line out of the water . There was an unbaited hook at the end of it . " It 's the name of the last king of the Montauk . Died in 1785 , an ancestor of mine . Spelled differently , but the same name . " " You do look kind of Indian , " said Golk , discerning in the denims and corduroys a poise which struck him as more graceful than that of the usual Long Islander . " I suppose you claim the Island , " he said . " No , " said Farrow . " Of course not . We sold out to the English . The Canarsie and Shinnecock were the only ones who ever made a fuss about claims . " " You live in the place-names . That 's not bad . "  | " I 'm not much Indian . I 've got my real last name from some dog-foot of Lord Howe 's . It 's Percival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You lonely out here ? " asked Golk . " Where do you live ? " Farrow Percival nodded toward the hut . " In the chateau there . I got a room in Long Island City too . What 's your business ? " The bright drops of water slid off the fishing line and Golk thought of the crowns they made when a slow-motion camera caught them hitting the surface . Farrow asked him again , and he said , " I 'm a toy salesman . " Farrow put his line back in the water . " Dull ? " " Yes , " said Golk . " The very word . " A pale spear of moon touched the edge of the sea and Golk took it in as balm . " It 's a real place you got here . " " On the nights it does n't rain or freeze . I got a heater for the cold , and an eight-year back file of Life magazines in there for the rain . I read astronomy books too . " Golk asked him why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes lit up , and said that he was waiting for a fish dumb , mean , or hungry enough to take the hook plain . Golk 's eyes lit with corresponding flame . " I get that , " he said . " Have you ever found one ? " " Two dead catfish in the same week four or five years ago . Then I got a woman 's shoe , and a lot of weed . " " What more can a man want ? " asked Golk . " Supper , " said Farrow . " If you want some , you can drive down the road about half a mile and bring back a few hot dogs . " Farrow reached into his pants and got out two quarters and a dime . Golk took them and said that he 'd be right back . He wasp159back ten minutes later . Farrow had a fire going on the beach and they roasted the hot dogs . Golk lay on the sand and looked up at the largest stretch of sky he 'd ever contemplated . Staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch , an eeriness in the million points of star that , with the rest of what he 'd felt since he 'd left the office , turned him from his usual to metaphysical concerns . " What 's it all about ? " he said . " Who gives a shit ? " said Farrow , flipping their garbage into the Atlantic . " I suppose a man ca n't live out here alone and think too much about it , " said Golk . " He 'd flush his marbles . " " I 'm only out here summer week ends , " said Farrow . " And I read astronomy . That 's enough for me . Knowing the names and the mechanisms which line them up there does me . I 'm self-educated . " " Me too , " said Golk . " And I know my limits , " said Farrow . " I do n't bite at bare hooks . The view and the names are enough for me . " " I suppose they should do me too , " said Golk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except I might be able to pick the Big Dipper out of the mess . " " That 's not much , " said Farrow . Golk was flat on the chilling sand , eyes closed , face blank . " Toy salesman , " thought Farrow . " Ought to throw him in . " But , in an hour , he shook Golk awake . " Thanks , " muttered Golk . He brushed himself off and said he might be back now and then during the summer ; he liked it out here . " Suit yourself , " said Farrow , and went into the house beforeGolk turned his motor over.  |p160After  Golk left the office , Hondorp and Hendricks looked at each other bubbling , as if a cork had been pulled out of them . " Shall we do a scene ? " asked Hondorp with an irony that pointed to the emptiness of the release now that the moment of bubbling freedom was past . " Let 's get out of here . " " Lurcher wants to go over personnel matters with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's take a whole week end off like human beings . " " I 'll leave word with Elaine , " said Hondorp , seeing her come in from her soda . " Coward , " muttered Hendricks . Hondorp followed Elaine into Golk 's anteroom , leaned over and kissed her as she sat down and announced that he and Hendricks were off for the day , " for the week end , as a matter from fact . " " With cameramen ? " asked Elaine equably . " Oh no ? Well , come see me when you get tired of the staple fare . " Hondorp told her to observe her place or he 'd stick an apple in her mouth and send her down to Alabama roasted . Then he put a hand on her breast , and as it were , shook it good-by . Elaine smiled peacefully . Hendricks , who had observed this body play with disgust , took Hondorp off by the arm . " What an act you spider monkeys put on . " " She relaxes me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rare phenomenon in the city . Among amateurs . It 's like going to a Turkish bath . " " Thank God you did n't start learning before you werep161half-dead , lover . Women would have to stay off the streets of the city . " But her words were lighter than she felt , and her mouth twisted into her cheeks with anger . " There 's Golk , " said Hondorp down in the street , and he pointed toward the river where Golk , an ambulant , invertedpear , was walking toward the paling , his great head like an Eastern dome over the street . " Let 's get a cab . " " Ruddy coward , " said Hendricks , climbing in and giving the driver the address of her garage . " Not Watch Hill again , " said Hondorp . " We 'll see . Grandmother would be so glad to see you . " " I ought to break your head right open . " " You are a brave one , " said Hendricks , feeling the old battle cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then drove up Park Avenue . At a stoplight they looked into each other 's eyes . " Where ? " asked Hendricks . Hondorp felt a new aimlessness in himself , one entirely unrelated to that of the undesigned walks of his former life , an aimlessness that was an evasion of destination . " Let 's fly to Paris , " said Hendricks . Hondorp smiled . " I do n't have a passport . " A taxi honked them into motion ; they turned left around the gardened middle of the Avenue and started back down south . As they made the turn , the careless velleity turned desire in both of them . " Let 's go , " said Hendricks . " I 've got an International Air Travel card . We 'll let the Greek pay for it . All we have to get is the passport . " " That 's all . " " I wonder if there 's a chance . Call up the Passport Bureau . Tell them your sister 's had an emergency operation in a hospital over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll bep162like a golk . " There was a phone in the glove compartment . As he recalled this , Hondorp caught fire . " Live your golk , " he said like an announcer . Hendricks turned again at Fiftiethand parked in front of the Ambassador . It took four hikes up the bureaucratic hierarchy to get Hondorp 's emergency to the proper level . " I have to go to Paris for a day or two tonight , " he said in a voice compoundedof urgency and command . " I 've never had or appliedfor a passport before . " " Impossible , " came a soft contralto . " My sister 's having an emergency operation and the doctor at the hospital  --  the American hospital I believe  --  said it might be fatal . She 's all alone , and I must go over . " He identified himself , gave references at the network , dug up his army serial number , and then waited . The contralto returned , softer than before , and said , " You can get an emergency pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come down here immediately upon securing passage . " " I 'll be down in an hour , " said Hondorp . " O.K. , " said Hendricks , far more calmly than Hondorp felt was warranted by the triumph . " Of course , " he thought , " for the rich and powerful , such a trip means nothing , but still , she must know what it means to me . " " I 'll go get the tickets , " said Hendricks , " and I 'll phone you confirmation at the Bureau . " " All right , " he said , emulating her businesslike control . " I 'll pack a little and then shoot down to the Bureau . " " We 're on our way , " she said , almost mournfully . They were , on a TWA flight leaving from Idlewild in three hours . Hondorp had signed affidavits attesting to the emergency , rushed out to get his pictures taken , got backjust before the Bureau closed , picked up his papers , taxied up to the Ambassador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were off . The rapid and devious ease of the execution of what was for Hondorp a fantastic scheme drove him to an exultation equivalent to that he found in lovemaking , but as the fantasy was indulged , as the flight became less the means of slaking desire and more the realization of a fabricated need , it became a kind of nightmare for him . He had visions of his story being challenged at Orly , of telephone calls to Paris hospitals , of the discovery that he had no sister , of being landed in the Azores and left for days , passportless , stateless , waiting to qualify for the Azores ' Americanentry quota . He left his filet mignon  --  cooked to a turn at Chambord  --  untouched on his plate . Hendricks ate it after finishing her own . " Why do n't we do this more often ? " she asked him . Her appetite for experience was revived by what left Hondorp hanging from his fears , the pursuit of novelty for its own sake , and she faced France like a college junior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his air of hush-hush ( he did n't mention his sister ) , and a faked call to Paris hastened the inspection . He and Hendrickstaxied to Paris , were driven to the Meurice , and asked for the best adjoining rooms in the hotel . They were assignedtwo fuliginous dens on the wrong side , but it was all they needed . It was only as he was writing in his name , citizenship , New York address and occupation on the hotel affiche that he came to the full realization of where he was , where he had been the day before , and where he would be in two more days . " It does n't matter where you are as long as it 's home , " Poppa Hondorp used to say , patting the largest piece ofp164furniture within reach , " And this is home . " This pronouncementhad filled blanks in Hondorp until his talk with Hendricks on the terrace his first day as a golk . Now he knew that it had served because he had never had the sense of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel , he felt that he was in the most self-conscious place in the world , a place that demanded that you become conscious of it , of its unlikeness to any place that you 'd been , a place that demanded that your life be shaped by , in , or against it . " The real thing , " Hondorp thought as he put down the pen . " No golk . The real thing . I 'm here . " He wanted to start seeing as much of the city as they could cover in a few hours . This was not Hendricks ' intention . " The idea , " she told him when he came into her room , " is to see nothing , one or two places maybe , exactly as we would if we came here every other week , just for a good cup of coffee or to see a special exhibit . " " You 're right , " said Hondorp , on the road to this conviction , but more slowly than his admission . It was certainly the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bus tour . " " That 's possible , but the hell with it . " " What places then ? " " Does n't matter . We 'll walk till we find them , or till we get tired of walking . " They went out , and she pointed toward the Tour Eiffel . " You might as well acknowledge the landmarks . " " I saw that from the plane . Any others to hand ? " She waved toward the Louvre and identified it . " O.K. ? " " Sated , " he said , though his heart pumped like an infant 's at his bottle . If he had dared , he would have said , " Oh , the wonder of life . " They walked toward Concorde , Hondorp studyingp165Sulka 's , the Continental , the bookstores and perfumeries in the fashion of his New York Wanderjahren . The French sounds and looks and smells touched him like a brook bath in the heat . " I 'm ecstatic , " he said . " I 'm glad , " said Hendricks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That makes monotony worthwhile . " " Relax , Jeanine , " he said to her between looks , and warmly . " All right , " she said sweetly , and found herself at ease . They were at Concorde , and the view of the great Place aswarm with cars , yet still open , sunny , capacious , ready for anything , guillotine or assembly , bowled them both over . " Flip flop , " said Hondorp . And Hendricks pressed his arm , something she had never done to anyone in her life . " Like honeymooners , " she said to herself , but she held on wondering if the gestures of simplicity would bring in the feelings too . This was the highpoint . A flock of jets curved maniacally over and away , and they turned melancholy . They walked across the bridge , down the left bank , and into a cafe at Quai Anatole France . They drank Pernod till their melancholystiffened and they could lift it from them . They ate spectacularly at La Kermesse , then walked back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they jumped into a taxi , went home and into Hondorp 's bed . " So I 've had it , " thought Hondorp as he slid off to sleep , a Genghis Khan of life come late but fully into his own . The next day Hendricks spent a year 's golk income on the rue St. Honore . At Balenciaga 's she bought three dresses without trying them on , this after a fierce fight with two fitters and a model . Hats , gloves , purses , underwear , shoes , she ripped the streets as if death were behind her . Finally shep166nearly catapulted a bouquinist into the Seine by handing him sixty thousand francs for his whole stall of books and prints . " Bring it to the Meurice , " she told him . " Je suis le Plan Marshall . " Hondorp 's only luxury was telephoning his father . It took half an hour to get the call through , and he waited in his room sweating with anticipation . " Hello Poppa , " he said when the phone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you ? Where did you spend the night ? Why does the operator have to talk to me ? This sounds like long-distance . Are you in trouble ? Do n't give me evasions . Come right back home . " Hondorp waited under the cascade , and when it stopped tumbling said that he was calling for a surprise . " I 'm in Paris , Poppa . " A sound like a discharge of birdshot came across the Atlantic . Then , " I 'm in Paris , Poppa . ' You 're in Poppa , Paris . What gives here on this phone ? Whaaaat are you , Herbert Federn Hondorp , doing ? Off the nut ? This I ask you . " Hondorp administered the final blow . " I 'll be back tomorrow morning . If you have a late breakfast , I 'll eat at home with you . " There was a costly , twenty-second pause , then a garbled proclamation . " We do n't wait breakfast for nobody bei Hondorp . Be here at eight . " The phone clicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then noticed that he had n't even used up the three minutes . " But who counts ? " he said aloud remembering a favorite joke of his father 's . That last night , they went to Ferdie 's on rue Seine and listened to a Greco imitator do a Portuguese weep-song to a rock-and-roll beat . At the next table , a French hipster gavep167the eye to Hendricks , then jerked a thumb toward the Greco type : " But it is the cheeck , no cat ? Fraiche , no ? " Hendricks illumined the brazier in her eyes and nodded . The hipster started to turn his chair into their table . Hondorp , suddenly oblivious of his old fear of body contact , held up his hand to stop the traffic . " Nous ne desirons rien , " he said firmly . The hipster 's face contorted for an interpreting minute , then , having interpreted correctly , returned to his beer . Hendricks opened her mouth and put it over Hondorp 's . " My great mannie , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two teen-agers gone romping through dreams of contact , they swayed to the dark fandangos of the cave . " So romancy , " whispered Hendricks . " I 've never had no real romancy . " " Pauvre chat , " cried Hondorp . He was feeling his way , knowing no terms that would suit it now . " It passed me by too . Just as if they had n't invented it yet . " " That 's it , my Hondie , " she said , lips on his ear , inhaling from there , causing him to sweat . " We 're pre-Romancy . Stranded in the provinces . " " Yes , " he said , " yes , " unable to force out more but unwilling to break the continuity which was , he knew , promising a fine night . And more . " Let 's skip , " she said , her face tense with need . " I so want it , even want you . " This whispered . He moved clumsily upstairs , hand in his pocket to restrain himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . " Must one walk ? " he asked . Hendricks led him down streets to a ratty little hotel , St. Thomas d ' Aquin et l'Univers , put three thousand francs onp168the counter , secured a key , and walked him up two flights . They came together , redeeming a measure of their loneliness . The next day they flew back . For most of the ten hours , their hands were laced together . And even each other 's handsweat pleased them . An hour after the taxi brought them to the Parisak Building , Hendricks and Hondorp sat with Lurcher in a small oval waiting room on the penthouse . They had been waiting ten minutes , minutes which the first two used to debate the reasons for the astonishing summons . The modest waiting room was the sanctum sanctorum of the network , the demure hole in the wall where the honorary Doctor of Laws ( Purdue ' 48 ) and Letters ( Franklin and Marshall ' 51 ) directed the enterprisesof which the network was but the most conspicuous . It was Lurcher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others had never been higher than the eighteenth-floor observation tower ( a pass was needed to get beyond that ) . They had however , seen Parisak 's helicopter descend and take off to and from the penthouse terrace . " The standard wait is ten minutes , " said Lurcher . " To let you compose your thoughts . " His melon head was seamed with wrinkles each of which was now a canal of perspiration . Still , he managed to sound calm , which annoyed Hendricks no end . " Time to prepare one 's case , but not time enough to get nervous . " She snorted , and the canals overflowed to make oases on Lurcher 's flannels . Hendricks was gratified ; she con/trived a belch and took pleasure in another inundation of the canals . " And you 've no idea ? " asked Hondorp . " I never said that . I said I did n't know what was going to be done or said . It 's clear what the cause here is . " " Then why not call Golk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How would you know ? " put in Hendricks . " Have you ever caused one ? " " Of course not , " said Lurcher , and his eyes widened as the door opened and a small man in the general shape of an Idaho potato on rollers appeared and said , " Wo n't you please come in ? I 'm Dr. Parisak . " " Do n't you have a secretary ? " asked Hendricks , letting her surprise take the form of a question so that she could establish a position . " Not really , " said Parisak leading them into a deskless room furnished a la Scandinavian moderne but with a bodied quality which came from three or four overstuffed chairs and a fifteen-foot sofa in front of an equal expanse of glass . The sun filtered in delicately ; the room was cool , anonymous . " I 'm a guinea pig for the automatic devices . For instance , if you 'll tell me what you 'd like to drink , you 'll see . Gin and quinine ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and four frosted glasses came out of the wall on a tray , were dropped easily onto tables beside each of the four occupied chairs . Hondorp noticed that the tables neither had legs nor were visibly suspended from the ceiling . " Very clever , " said Hendricks , pointing to this same phenomenonand then indicating the manner of service . " You must be very happy here . "  | " I 've heard you were a wit , Mrs. Hendricks . It 's a pleasure to enjoy you in person . " A cigarette box passed itself around the room . Hondorp laughed , or at least rumbled with the bubbling groan that served to release the energy which in others was called laughter . Parisak looked at him , concerned , apparently found reassurance , and then said that some people felt that such antics were carrying automation too far . Lurcher said quickly that he did n't think so . " Did you know that machines can reproduce now ? " asked Parisak . " How did you hear that I was a wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanswered . " I 'm afraid I missed that , " said Parisak , a shadow seeming to touch his face . Hendricks repeated it , and Parisak said , " I am acquainted with your former husband . " They got down to business . Parisak stroked his hard tan face with a hard tan finger , then removed it and said , " Golk got us into trouble . He has no tact , only what I suppose you would call great gifts . We should like to continue to use those gifts , or at least the creations of those gifts , but we can not use Golk . We want to continue the old style program , much as it 's going now , but we want you two , Mr. Hondorp and Mrs. Hendricks , to superviseit . We can not trust Golk 's ambition or his tact . Perhapswe can employ him as advisory editor or in similar capacity . That is the only way the program can continue . We want it to continue , and so do thirty-five million other people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is amusing . I myself think that it is one of the few real contributions to the medium . If you agree with me , nothing would give mep171greater pleasure than to take up the option with only the aforementioned alteration made . The program is copyright by the network . There is no question of its being Golk 's property . " Hondorp felt called upon to say something , but was unable to . After fifteen wordless seconds , he heard Hendricks say , " I should be delighted to help continue Golk 's work . I think this would be in his interest as well as ours . " These words released in Hondorp a warm wave of acquiescence . He felt like laughing again , but , with some difficulty , held back . " We 've known , " he said finally , " that Golk has been seriously overreaching himself . We 've feared the consequences . This is more generous than we could have hoped for . " " I 'm glad , " said Parisak . " Glad that you are able to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater reluctance "  --  theshadow was again on his face  --  " but your breadth of vision is greatly appreciated , a great relief . Mr. Lurcher will work out the details of the change , and will , as usual , attend your screenings in advance to see that they ( 10 not contain violations of the network code . This until you become entirely familiar with it yourselves . " " I understand , Dr. Parisak , " said Lurcher , formally , oddly , darkly . " I only trust that Golk will . " Parisak rose also . " I hope so also , " he said . " But at least the future of the program does not depend on his understanding . " He took two steps forward , and then , almost like the cigarette box and the tray , he disappeared . They sat alone in the automatic room . " Can we finish our drinks ? " asked Hendricks . " If you can swallow them , " said Lurcher . Hendricks tipped up her glass and drained it . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that any feeling , bourgeois or otherwise , could survive in your sarcophagusof shit . " Lurcher drew a handkerchief the size of a diaper from his pocket and drew it back and forth on his face . " Poor old Golk , " he said . For a moment Hondorp felt the same sympathy , and his feelings might have deepened except that the door they 'd entered swung open and Lurcher said that this meant it was time to go . They went downstairs without exchanging another word . The Monday morning after his jaunt , Golk returned to an office whose foundations had shiftd under him . He knew it the minute he stepped inside the room . People said " Hello " to him as he passed their desks ; orderliness pressed on things . " You ca n't loosen the reins for a second , " he muttered , and he commandeered a screening , a Plans Meeting , a publicity run-through . Then , in his cave , he wrote memorandaon the budget , projected golks , thought of locations . The tempo accelerated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He called Hondorp and Hendricks for a reporton negotiations with the network ; they were n't around . He called Lurcher ; he was in conference . Golk was too busy now to mind a few obstacles to serenity ; indeed , he needed disappointments to flag his work . In the afternoon , he took Pegram out to shoot a golk , a scene in a butcher 's with Golk passing off as steak what was obviously the hind quarters of a thin dog.  |p173When  he returned , Golk called up Hendricks at home and asked her to have dinner with him . " I 'm dead , " she said . " What 's the trouble ? Lurcher giving you a hard time ? " That was it , she said , and said " Good-by . " Usually he was the one who introduced the matter of good-bys . It was annoying , if not worth a fuss . He rang up Elaine and she came over . Elaine was always a joy to Golk . He had a Parisian twenties ' love of the Negro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ebony , Jet , and In the Dark , even sending at times for the hair-straighteners and nose pins of their ads . Although Elaine 's primitiveness was a contrived article  --  she was the daughter of a millionaire insurance man from Memphis and New York , and had spent half her life at the swish Negro resorts of the Northeastern states  --  he took to it as a source of power . He had discovered her at the studio where , as a seventeen-year-old , she was hired to dance for eight hours a day with fifteen other couples , a spectrum of New York races and types , the idea being that whenever a regular program broke down , they would swing into rumbas . Golk took in one of the sessions , then worked out a scene using Elaine as focus , she being the only person in the room whose face was divorced from the mechanical Lethe of the dance . From then on , she worked with Golk , a splendid fulcrum for her weird revolt from the skin prison . Golk 's night with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning saw the same sluggishness , the same disquieting neatness in the office . It wore him down again . Part of it seemed to be that there were fewer people around . He dug out his personnel list and went over thep174names . " Where 's that cameraman with the salt-shaker nose ? " he yelled from his office . " Where 's Gusberg ? " Elaine called in from the anteroom that Gusberg was out with Hondorp on some sort of deal . " What 's that mean ? " shouted Golk . ( There were no intercomschez Golk . ) " Une aflaire de je ne sais quoi . " Golk shook his head in misery . There were no such affairs in his group . He called for a screening of yesterday 's golk . " Fitch is out too , " called Elaine . " Golk me , " yelled Golk , not sure himself what that meant . " Who asked for Fitch ? " He flew out of the office , ran head-on into a teamster type pushing a camera out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know how , " said the teamster . " I do n't even recognize you , " said Golk . " Mr. Hondorp told me to help out . " " O.K. , " said Golk . " I remember . " He reared back , let out an enormous kick at the camera muzzle , and fell back against a desk as the teamster pulled the camera out of range and wheeled it from the officeGolk stared after him and set out for Lurcher 's office . He was stopped in the anteroom by Lurcher 's secretary who said that Lurcher was in conference . " I 'll wait . " The secretary went into the main office and came out to say that Mr. Lurcher 's conferees had gone out the back way a few minutes ago . Golk charged in . " What 's going on , I ask you ? What 's happened to my crew ? Where 's my renewal ? Who 's caring forme ? " Lurcher got out of his seat by pushing his hands on hisp175desk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , wide-eyed , to it , went back to his desk , took out a pint of Haig and Haig Pinch , tipped it for about four fingers , wiped his mouth on his shirt sleeve , groaned , and put it away . Golk studied the actions . " Not bad , " he said abstractly . " Pudovkin could n't have matched it . A mite like Ford in My Darling Clementine . " Lurcher said quickly , " We 're not renewing , Sydney . You 're great , too great for us , maybe too great for the medium . You 've reached a point in your development where you ca n't and should n't be held back . We ca n't hold you . And we ca n't have you . Maybe the medium itself is too cramped for you . There are n't a million people in the countrywho can take you as you are now , and we live at the minimumof a million . Maybe this is too strong . There are a millionof us who can take what you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see , but the woods are so full of threats , of suits , we ca n't walk a foot wthout holding our breath . You ca n't live from day to day like that , Sydney . " For Golk , Lurcher 's words were suddenly visible , a mist around the repugnant continent where lived the world 's beasts . Lurcher himself he hardly saw ; the obesity seemed something abstract , eternal , the principle of opposition . He kept watching the words . " We do n't want to lose it all though . On Camera started here , it 's still a great idea , and we want it  --  and you  --  to stay . We 'll let Jeanine and Herbert handle the troublesome parts , and you can relax back and give them pointers , a grand old man of ideas . It 'll be a vacation for you , and we 'll see that you 're not seriously abused on the mazooma side of it . " It was then Golk lost the words and heard only sounds . These went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an ulcer growing in himself , a virulent emission of acids congregating in his body , and he had a view he had never before had , a look into the inner chamber of the world , the pulse of things , the principle of movement . He threw up on the rug . Lurcher 's head turned emerald ; he pounded buzzers , gasped , opened his collar , and went to the sealed window as if it could admit air . The foul odors beat in Golk 's head , and he rushed out of the office . Golk looked at himself curled up in the silver ball of the Forty-sixth Street Automat 's water spigot . He was all nose , mouth , and bald head , a worn-out ball in some occult soccer game . He kept staring until someone coughed him aside . Then he went over to a table with his glass of water and jelly doughnut , the last a treat reminiscent of the few he had allowed himself in his Providence years . Every two weeks , on his day off from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat at a smutty restaurant called Button 's Place , and eaten four jelly doughnuts and a cup of coffee . Here he sat across from a tieless , coatless , fat-nosed blond errand boy ( his packages on the floor and on one of the other chairs ) gobbling blueberry pie a la mode . " Seat 's saved , " he lied to Golk , but dove back into his sweet gore when Golk sat down . Inside and out , Golk was tired . On his walk up from the Parisak Building a massive woman had slammed up against him rounding a corner . " Drunken bum , " she 'd said as he bounced off the wall , for Golk was reeling up the streets , thep177hot weight of the buildings pressing on him , the sun grindinghim , the cars on the avenues aiming at him . Out loud , he said , " What 's it all come to ? " His mouth was filled with dough and jelly , so the question came to little more than a groan . " What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilting an anteater chin toward Golk . " Push it out of your teeth , man . " " Drop dead , " said Golk abstractlyA fluid triangle opened up at the side of the boy 's mouth . Blueberries whitened with vanilla cream edged down his chin . " What was that ? " he asked , eyes aglow with aggression . " Shut your head or I 'll punch it for you , " said Golk . The boy 's response to this was to grab the remaining half of Golk 's jelly doughnut , push it into Golk 's cheek and then rub it up and down his face . The sugared , jellied dough crawled in Golk 's eyes and nostrils , all over his face and he sat there , stupefied , watching the boy grab his packages and shoot for the door with a valedictory obscenity . He sat , smeared and miserable for nearly a minute before dipping a napkin into his water and wiping off his face . " I 'll punch his damn head , " he muttered . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could n't even remember what the boy looked like , could hardly think where he was despite the sea of eyes , repelled , tickled , sympathetic , in which he felt himselffloating . He went out and walked up Broadway , losing himself in the moving crowd . He was in shirt sleeves , one side of his snap-bow tie hung down , and there were flecks of jelly on his collar . The great head bobbed back and forth , and from a distance he looked a loose buoy in the street . People circled him as he approached . Then , as he passed the Penny Arcadep178at Fifty-first , he saw himself in the window , saw himself as a stranger , a victim , someone to golk ; he straightened his tie and brushed himself off . But the sun had touched him hard , his head was a caldron , he dripped sweat onto his shirt , his underwear rolled up around his legs , his socks coiled his ankles . " Lord God , " he said aloud , and people walking turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Columbus Circle and sat on a bench under the white column , rubbing a fist against his heart which seemed to him to be beating fiercely , irregularly . Sittingeased him . He sat legs out , palms open on them , eyes closed , breathing hard , pain entering and leaving him like trains at a busy station . He felt something hard in his right hand and looked up to a nickel and a fat back in a floozie 's dress crossing the street . " Ha , ha , ha , ha , " he went softly . He squeezed the coin , and the contact brought him back , reorganized him . He walked down to the Nedick 's on Fiftyseventh , drank four glasses of the orange drink , ate two hot dogs , and then took a cab back to the Parisak Building . The cloud , compact of puffed snow gleaming with the rising sun , Hondorp 's future , that had been with Pizarro in the bookstore , was overhead ready to discharge . It was inevitable , part of history 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of waiting were like the tranquil yawn of blue against which the cloud gleamed , white and promising . Subcelestially , Hondorp told himself that Parisak 's proposalwas the salvation of Golk , or at least of everything thatp179was important in Golk and which Golk in his artistically degeneratestage was trying to obliterate . Golk had been seized by that virus of ambition which so often attacks men of spirit : it consists in their dissatisfaction with what they do best , because the very ease of their accomplishment makes it seem a toy to them , illusion , make-believe . They yearn for the charisma of politicians whose hands can bring a city to tears or riot . Hondorp explained this to his father who now listened to his son 's breakfast pronouncements with the gratifiedattention with which he himself used to be attended . More , he fed his boarder questions . " But what will happen to your chief ? " " He 'll be invited to act as advisory director , but what it 'll come to will be his resignation . It 's a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homme d'affaires with his father  --  " that if they 're too big to fire , just insult them . Resignation is the only sensible step he can take now . He should rest for a while , and then turn his talents  --  of which he has plenty  --  to something new . It 's this turning in and about your own stuff which ruins you and it . Fresh fields and pastures new for Golk . " The old man rubbed out a Hav-a-Tampa , a box of which was his son 's biweekly gift , and sighed that man 's lot was an inconstant one . Hondorp , for whom life , up until a few months ago , had been a good deal more constant than not , said that Golk might well relish a taste of constancy , a routine which would let him take the world in , rather than having to supply it with his inventions . " I 've hardly begun in the supply end of things , " Hondorp said , holding up an index finger to drive it home for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep180strain of manufacturing . And this industry is worse than any other in the world . It gnaws away at your brain without givingit time to renew itself . " " Come back home , sonny dear , " said Poppa Hondorp without a second 's reflection , as if the remark had been stretched ready on an elastic for weeks . " Why should more people than necessary waste their brains on the city riffraff ? " " It 's too late , Poppa , " said his son . He was looking across the street at the cab stand to see if there was a free one to take him downtown . " I 'm in it up to the neck . I should n't even waste time regretting it . They do n't want you to have time for that . That 's the way they control you . " This scene  --  of the great man 's miseries -- completed , Hondorp patted his father 's shoulder , called " Good-by " to Marie , and scooted for the elevator . In the splendid isolation of the taxi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hendricks were to meet in the office they 'd been assigned by Lurcher on the tenth floor and then go in to Golk together . Hondorp did not look forward to it . Although he had rigorously excluded the word " treachery " from all connection with the supplantingof Golk , it lay in the soil of his anxiety . He would have to jump high to overlook so ugly a barrier to his succession . In the elevator which had sped the three of them from Parisak 's sanctum the other day , Lurcher had silenced the old nerve which had tingled sympathetically for Golk . He becamethen what he would be from then on , the homo networkusgurus . " All of us here are on the edge of going , " he had said then , " balancing ourselves every minute over failureswhich would paralyze men in most fields . Where Golk 's fallen , we can all fall . " When he turned reflective , his eyep181pips glistened , and were transformed into steel marbles , and the wires which held the great load of flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would relax , the flesh expanding as if in high tide . ) " Golk has become a commoditywe can not hold on our shelves . " Hendricks , who provided a balance in every group by taking the role of the opponent , despite any personal contradictionsinvolved , had aimed her head at Lurcher like a revolvermuzzle . " We 're trafficking with a big man , Fats . " Lurcher clutched at his midsection as if a genuine bullet reposed there , and after a gasp , said , " An operating principle of executives in the entertainment industries is to keep shakingup the performers , so that even if the public ca n't tell the puppets from the masters , the puppets can . " The little eyes clicked around in orbit , and when they reported what was apparently stunned silence , Lurcher smiled . " That goes for you too . Great opportunities , equal dangers . Smell of roses today , shit tomorrow . But we want you . You 're the only people who can do the job . Now . Half an hour network time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make it something more . We 're trying to sell some sponsors on the whitewashedversion ; it ai n't easy , I 'll tell you that . I 'd advise you not to let your sketches include any sinister comments on vegetable oil or filtered cigarettes . Outside of that , you 're free . No strings . None , that is , but the ones alluded to already . Now , I 'm going to break it to Golk myself . Then you better have a talk with him . But do n't let it affect you . If the surgeon sees the patient 's tears , he 's going to cause a lot more if he lets them make his hand tremble . Get it ? " " We get it , " said Hendricks , seeing herself , scalpel in hand , presiding over a lobotomy on the fat man.  |p182Po|p|pa  Hondorp 's lipoma shared by now not a few of the characteristics of his head , and when Hendricks shook hands with him a few hours after their conference with Lurcher , she blinked to orient herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulped and goggled at Hondorp 's announcement , and which , after thirty seconds during which it seemed to stretch as if to swallow the whole room , leveled at Hendricks a question which responded to the announcement , " So you 're going to marry him ? What for ? " They stood at the threshold of the living room , and the lipoma twitched back toward the silent television set as a strayed child to its mother 's cry . Poppa Hondorp , and then his guests , followed the cry into the room , and there Hendricksfixed her eyes on the soft veined feet which Poppa drew out of his backless slippers to rest on the table next to the TV Guide . Watching them was a relief from watching the monstrous anti-head on his neck . " That 's not the right thing to say , Poppa , " said Hondorp . " It 's not a proper question . In fact , it 's an assertion . " " You 're not prepared for marriage , and you know it , " said the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge stage whisper , " we 're getting to be a regular hotel here with your friends . " " Poppa , " growled his son . " I 've already learned how ready he is , Mr. Hondorp , " said Hendricks , ignoring the whisper . " At least , he 's ready enough for me . Anyway , it 's not going to be permanent . Do n't worry about it . " Poppa Hondorp was accustomed to the responses of televisionheroines , and he could n't make sense of Hendricks ' .  |p183Its  strangeness , coupled with the substitution of " Mr. " for his proper title , smelled somehow of a disaster , but he could do little more than inch ahead on his own thin path . " Some are made for husbands , some for bachelors . My sonny is the bachelor type pure . Undiluted . For him , a woman permanentlyaround the house would be like for me an elephant in the bathroom . It is not to the temperament . " " He 's bought me an engagement ring already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . " " With what has he bought ? " This halfway between outrageand amazement . " Let 's see . " Behind her back , Hendricks shifted a family sapphire from right to left hand , and held the latter up to the old man 's proper head . He sniffed at it . " He 's been stealing , " he mumbled . " You 've been stealing , " turning to his son . " She lent me the money , " said Hondorp , batting his fatherback like a tennis ball . The old man clapped his lipoma , sank back in his chair , and groaned , " This world is not the world I know . I have no co-ordinate for this world . Where are traditions ? Common sense ? " He looked pathetically toward the silent screen . " I should have guessed it would come to this . You do n't break life open at the seams at the age of thirty-eight without fes-tering . " " Lovely , Poppa , " said Hondorp . The old man was getting tiresome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tolerance-threshold . " All right , enough , " said the old man , getting out of his armchair . " I 'll say no more but joyous things . Why dampen ? I wish you both joy . We 'll have a fine dinner , and then you two children  --  " he groaned here despite himself  --  " go outp184and enjoy yourself in the city , while I watch the world 's miseryin the Texaco news . " " Time repairs everything , Poppa , " said his son with gentleness , and he put an arm around his father 's shoulders and helped him toward the dining room . He had never before in his life made or felt like making such a gesture . An hour later , he and Hendricks walked south on Central Park West , going back the same way on which they had made the connubial decision less than three hours earlier while sitting on one of the stone benches in the Theodore Roosevelt enclave of the Museum of Natural History . An hour before that Lurcher had called to say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken it badly . " Puked all over a **27;1957;TOOLONG carpet , " said Lurcher , this aspectof the coup d'etat being the one he would remember longest . Putting the phone down , Hendricks had held out her hand , not particularly for Hondorp , but for someone . Hondorp had taken it . " We 'd better stick together for a while , " she 'd said , and they went out and walked west and then north on Eighth Avenue . When they 'd reached the museum , the sun was pouring a gold halo on Teddy 's glasses and his horse 's snout . " Naturalist , Statesman , Author , " said Hendricks reading some of the attributes incised on the white stone wall which ringed the briefly sanctified statue . They sat on the bench under the slab which read " Naturalist , " and looked over the green blur of the Park , holding hands like innocents fearfullyen route to knowledge . Hendricks was en route to what she thought of in Golklike terms as a new form of knowledge . The concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over and over in her own mind . Treason , the betrayal of Golk , was , inp185the long run , what she was , or so she thought , after . She enteredinto it not despite , but because of the special pain it caused . Feeling Hondorp 's hand in hers , she said , as if prompted from the statue 's heroic voice , " The world was all before her . " The remark sprang from her lifelong devotion to the cult of experience . There was still something new to do and feel . Just after she had left the boarding school in Vevey and had set up in the Hotel Louis le Grand off the rue de Rivoli , she determined , after the fashion of her Stendhalian heroine , that the next crucial step in her development was discoveringwhether sex was as important as girls of advanced stripe alleged . Her procedure had been simple . The night elevator man at the hotel was a dull-looking but well-built twentyyear-old . One night , Hendricks came home at three o'clock , woke him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow'sconcern about his elevator was dissipated by a tenthousand-francnote , and then , almost as effectively , by the sight of the young Hendricks ' dress , slip , bra , pants , and naked body . Hendricks helped him unbutton his uniform , and then , have , as it were , his way with her . A minute after it was over , she said , " That will do . You can go back to the elevator . " She reached into her purse for another ten thousand francs , handed it to the grateful fellow , and turned in under her sheets . " So that , " she 'd said , " is the great , distinguished thing . " For Hendricks , the distinguished thing was that its small charm had relieved her of what she knew would be the intolerable burdens of the chase . Now she approached the betrayal of Golk with some of the same experimental inquisition . If the aftermath of betrayal was to be an uncontrollable depression , then the act would be worthless for her ; if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have satisfaction as an element of it , the satisfaction of achievement . Not that she was in such control of this experiment as she had been of the other , nor could it be regarded  --  as that one was  --  as a trial run . One had to decide if one was going to risk it ; she had decided instantly in Parisak 's sanctum , her decision fueled by Parisak'smention of her husband . Life was not war , for Hendricks , but war was part of life , and she had more training there than most . Now , as far as she could tell , betrayal would be no more significant than any other human relationship ; still , it bore a history of fatality , and Hendricks was willing to risk the end for the feeling . Yet she wished to distribute her chances with someone else . And someone was at hand , and now , actually in hand . For someone who wished to manipulatehis experience rather than be at the mercy of it , the coming confrontation with Golk promised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her confederate , she relished it almost as much as she trusted that its aftermath would be the exultant feeling of further liberation from sentimentality . The anticipation of exultation filled the atmosphereshe felt was appropriate to the dedication here in Teddy Roosevelt 's Pavilion , the atmosphere of a brilliant , unmournful wake. .. . where to choose their place of rest , and Providence their guide . ' " continued Hondorp . " ' They '  --  is it hand in hand ' ?  --  " and he looked at her hand gripped round his . " Shall we get married ? " asked Hendricks . " It will give people pause . " Hondorp watched a pair of infant hoodlums scraping bird droppings off the backside of Roosevelt 's charger and flickingthem at each other . " Legally ? " he asked calmly , his ver/bal reaction outrunning his emotional one , which , when it caught up to the verbal calmness , fed on it . " A detail . Living together publicly is the issue . " " I 'd like to , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealinggaps in the certainty . " The system of my needs has changed more than I would have believed . " Hendricks laughed her rare laugh . " Honey-dorp , " she said . " Honey-dorp . " " Do n't laugh . What counts is underneath . I 've been so used to things . There 's such a lovely economy about tranquillity . And now it 's been shaken and shaken . It ca n't ever be restored , but I keep wondering whether the new needs are authentic . Maybe they 'll die out if I let them go . " His eyes were lost in the Park ; he barely saw the enclosures of the avenues , the cars zipping up Central Park West . " This park , " he said , " used to hold all I needed . " " Why reduce the world to your doll 's house ? " she asked , beginning in anger but modulating to sympathy and genuinewonder . " Though maybe I do n't have a right to say . For me , almost every year meant being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back to . I did n't mind living in Watch Hill as a girl , but I 've thought so much since about its damn dullness that I ca n't recover that ; or certainly do n't want to . My parti iris is for getting on . " " That 's a real doll 's house to me , " he said . " I do n't even know why we 're speculating like this about it . Speculating does n't have very much to do with what we 're going to decide , does it ? I think I would like to live with you , have you around most of the time , sleep with you and talk to you . So let 's say Yes , ' more or less . O.K. ? " " This is my lust for novelty repaying me , " she said smiling . " I guess you 'll surprise me more than almost anybody . "  | " Do n't worry your future so much , " he said with an answeringsmile , and they linked fingers and looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . " Shall we spring it on the old man ? " he asked , and when she nodded , they walked up a few blocks to the house . It was dark on their walk back downtown after dinner , and in front of Roosevelt 's prancer , and as a mockingly tender reminder of their partnership , they placed connubial kisses on each other 's lips . When Hendricks and Hondorp walked into Golk 's cave like a tandem bicycle act , he looked up at them with a radiant kindness unlike any they had seen on his or any other face . It was as if a rock garden were transformed into a spring of flowers , sweet airs , and bird calls . It dazzled them . Lights seemed to play over the little cave as at a movie premiere . They stood blinking before his dagger-shaped desk waiting , penitents before the last judgment . Golk had waited for them motionless for an hour , conjuringup the energy which was to illuminate their entrance . It was a spectacular display of artificial fireworks , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure was the hatred which Golk felt , that he had , when the feeling was strongest , gone to the mirror to observe its shape , the lines it made in his face , the discoloration of the iris . The feeling had been strongest in the night of Lurcher 's revelation . In the hours that succeeded , the hatred became almost abstract , divorced from the actions and forms of his old subordinates ;  |p189and  , in becoming abstract , Golk began to see it as a principle of behavior . When they walked into the cave , Golk regarded them as vehicles of his feeling , and it was his feeling and what could be done with it that counted . He had a moment of surprise , merely recognizing them as people , these two whacked-up oddballs strayed into a universe of which they understood nothing . Nothing lasts , thought Golk , and feelingsare the most precious transient of all . Only hermits like Farrow could preserve things , eight years of Life piled up in his hut . Not in the world , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did feelings or anything else count . So his smile was fixed by analysis . " It 's good of you to smile , Sydney , " said Hondorp , charginginto the authority the smile seemed to assume . He sat on a corner of the desk , while Hendricks stood , held by that circumferentialgrin which had for her the glint of a web . " I 've always welcomed the inevitable , " said Golk , " and been grateful when it has n't beaten me to death . You two were more than I could have hoped for . If they 'd have brought in some slick interviewer-type , I 'd have shot myself , and maybe Parisak . I 'm surprised they took it as well as they did . They 're supplying all the counsel , putting up the money for any settlements , taking care of the publicity . Pretty decent . Of course , it had to come to this . I 've known from the beginning . The idea was too good not to carry its own punishmentwith it . The sting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enterprise . " " Good show , Golk , " said Hendricks , using contempt as a veil for fear . " Brave chap . " " Ha , ha , " laughed Golk . " I shall miss you , Jeanine . " " Miss her ? " asked Hondorp , determined to beef up Golk 's smile , reduce its spread but give it solidity . " Why miss her ?  |p190You  know everybody needs you here , and no one more than the two of us . That advisory job is not mere salve . If it 's salve at all , it 's for the wounds we anticipate having . The few notionswe have all come from you . You let us fall and we bounce , but we ca n't bounce unless you let us fall . " " That 's a modest tack , Herbert , " said Golk gently . " Very nice of you too . " " You 'd probably like to start something else on your own , " said Hendricks sitting down at the desk . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Let things come naturally . That 's my tempo . I 'll finish out the two weeks here , and then we 'll see . " " You know , Golk , " said Hendricks , and she took out a lipstickand mirror . " We 're getting married . " There was a short pause during which Golk 's smile seeped almost all the way around his head . " I should have known , " he said . " Such collaboration as yours leads to marriage . I 'm happy for you . " " At least , we 're going to be living together , " she went on , her vague hesitance that of someone translating a difficult text . " I see . Of course , that 's sensible . Nothing lasts . There 's no reason for unnecessary  --  " pause  --  " systematizing . " He took a green cigarillo from his desk , flourished a kitchen match to flame , and puffed , the act becoming a kind of congratulatory fireworks . " All good things seem to come at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant " bad things . " " And I suppose they 'll go the same way . " " Not unlikely , " said Golk with measured sadness . " It 's the wheel of fortune . On which I 'm being racked a bit myself these days . "  |p191Hendricks  made the mocking sound of desperation usuallyrepresented as " tsk , tsk . " Golk 's face seemed to shadow under the bright lights . " Charming of you , Jeanine . I thought you 'd been slammed into enough walls yourself to remember what it was like . You always did have a poison sac in you though , did n't you ? " " That 's not like you , Sydney , " said Hondorp , doing a Sir Anthony Eden to the member of the opposition . " And now look who 's passing out the demerits , " said Golk , his eyes borrowing the green colors of the cigarillo , and glittering with the sharp turn of the discussion . " The young Sammy , thirty-eight years of piety distributing its wisdom from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a charming turn of affairs . " Hendricks was on her feet now , paler than Hondorp had ever seen her . Her face seemed the merest thickening of white light . " The sword is drawn , eh Sydney ? I 'd wondered where it was . You 're down in the dirt with us after all . You ca n't take it better than anyone else . Listen to all your victimsnow , pal . Oh , the wheel of fortune racks me . ' You lousy little fourflusher . You were warned what was coming . We had it all out with you . That 's more than your victims ever got from you , more than we ever got  --  advance notice . How great it is to see you feeling the squeeze for a change . This is what the world is for most of us . You 've coasted through on nerve long enough . Vibrate , mister , vibrate . " She slapped the back of her right hand into her left palm , once , twice , and then rapidly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniature but the wild flames in her eyes , flames which touched Golk 's to equivalent incandescence . " Head-on , eh Jeanine ? " he returned , his voice lower than a growl , hoarse with contention and pain . " The cesspoolp192cover is off , eh ? For weeks , you 've been accumulating your stink , and now I see what it looks like . Why did n't I smell it earlier ? You 've been walking through this office like the plague , and I did n't see it till now . Look at you , the whitenessof the whale . You leper . And here , " with a long finger at Hondorp , " here 's the licker of your festers , drunk on your pus . You two , Judas and Mrs. Judas . You lousy , fourflushing stinkers . What am I wasting my guts on you for ? " " All yellow now , eh Sydney ? Backbone quivering , little lamb ? Poor baby . All lost in the big woods . Hard world , lamby ? Cold winds ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wasted your guts on us ? Why ? I 'll give it to you , rathead . Because we stripped our guts out on the floor for you to tramp on every day of the world . We were born giving and you came up grabbing and snatching and splitting . Now waste them . Waste them . " Hands into the tornado , Hondorp groped ahead . " Please , please . Sydney . Jeanine . What are we doing ? Where are we going ? No point to it . Break it off . Do n't listen . It 's just tension . We 've had a hard week . Doucement . Things 'll work out . As Hondorp talked , Golk 's eyes yielded flames to embers and these to the familiar soft lights of his awareness . His bulk , which had swollen double during his outburst , had now retreated into his surprisingly petite frame . His hands folded , his great head bent over in shame . " Awful . Awful , " he said . " How awful . Dogs we were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? " Hendricks , panting in the middle of the cave , rocked her head up and down , back and forth all round on her neck like a fighter loosening up . She looked gone , lost . The aimlessp193motion became the nod of negation , back and forth . " Golkie . I 'm sorry . Forgive me . It never happened . " The cave seemed about to collapse with their shame . The three of them were still , sweating remembrance out of their systems . " We can never be the same , " said Golk . " But nothing can . Once you see the claws , you fear the scratch . Your own claws . Am I a wolf ? Yes . I know it . In part . So what 's to be done ? " Inside himself , he heard the whirr of the machines . It was not unpleasant for him . Hondorp and Hendricks regarded him as aficionados of a great artist might regard the one example of a late style . There seemed to be nothing else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright lights , though outside , in the main room , they heard , but as if from another galaxy , the tiny cracks of a couple of typewriters . " We 'll go on , " said Hondorp . " Things wo n't be so bad . They 'll work out . A few weeks will have us all through the crisis . " " So he says , " said Golk softly . " See here , " he said , and scrambling among the cigarillos , he came up with a thin glass tube of yellow pills separated from each other by cotton wedges . He held up the tube and the pills glistened ; the tube seemed to be sweating . The sweat came from Golk 's palm . " Why not ? I 've got more than most , but I 've done my bit . And what else ? Nothing . I 'm not much on food , on women  --  " a mournful look at Hendricks  --  " on narcotics . Why not ? " " Go ahead , " said Hendricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm with it . That 's one thing we can do that the animalsca n't . End it when we want to . " " Do n't be nuts , Jeanine , " said Hondorp , and he clenched as if to hit her in the face . " What kind of stupid viciousnessp194are you trying to peddle . The act is one for privacy anyhow . That 's the most private of acts . Anything else is display , the worst . " " Herbert knows he 'll be an accessory , " smiled Golk . " It 's got nothing to do with that , " said Hondorp . " Or very little . I 'm not interfering with you , but I 'll be damned if I 'm going to push you off the cliff , or sell tickets while you go over . It 's got about as much relationship to what you feel , as doing a buck-and-wing . It 's like sinking into a marsh . The two of you do n't give a man a foothold between you . " He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarillo , and then tried to take the pills out of Golk 's hand on the way back . Golk moved them out of his reach . " Little Jesus Hon-dorp . " " Quit laughing at your betters , " said Hendricks to Golk . " A piece of decency left in this world and to you it looks like a turd . " This was said more in weariness than anger . They had all gone up and down the emotional roller coaster once and could not manage it again . Golk reached for a bottle of Coca-Cola from inside the desk , opened it on a drawer , took one of the pills , swallowed it , and washed it down with a long swig of coke , a swig which was interrupted by his dropping the bottle to the floor and his head , with an immense crash , on the desk . This took about eight seconds . A great moan came deep out of Hondorp . " Ooghhhhhh . " He fell back against the wall of the cave . " Poppa , poppa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rocketed from paralysis , leaped up to Golk , pushed his head back against the chair rest , stuck her finger into his throat , elicited a tiny gurgle ,  |p195lost  him as he slumped over the chair on the floor , straddled his back , tried popping the head back again , then , her own head rocked back and she let his fall back on his arms . Hondorp was down now , feeling for Golk 's wrist . " Where 's the pulse ? Where do you feel the pulse ? " Failing to feel one , he rolled Golk over and put his ear to his chest . " I think he 's beating , " he said . " He 's still beating . " " Golk , " said Hendricks quietly . " Golk . " " Pick up the phone , " said Hondorp . He sprang up to the desk , looked vainly for a phone , and then called out , " Help , " but no sound came out of his throat . He started to run for the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and saw Golk getting off the floor , brushing himselfoff , and smiling . From behind a corner light , the strange ship 's head of Fitch poked out , the bow opened up dangerously , and the words , " You 're On Camera , kiddies , " came out . Hondorp fell into Hendricks ' arms . They put their heads together as if hiding each other from Golk , Fitch , and the world . " So , " said Hendricks . " So you did it again . " Hondorp was shaking , toe to scalp hair . " Twice , " he managed to say , " twice is too much . " " Special event , my dears , " said Golk . " Special event . Not for the show . Just a souvenir . " " You 're beyond belief , Golkie . Absolutely the end . How could you do it ? " She was off the floor , making up at Golk 's own mirror , behind which , of course , was one of the cameras . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juices run smoother . A little truth and a little shock never hurt anyone . Is n't this the road to health . And what a golk ! " He was back at his desk , smiling , cleansed even from his abstraction . He had put it to work , had gone into action . He could startp196afresh . Before him , Hendricks and Hondorp stood like sheets on a laundry line , flying and crumpling in the high wind he supplied . " Would n't have though it , would you ? Well , it 's therapy , and more than that . Ever hear the story of the poet who came up to a young poet who was weeping his eyes out , complaining he was too unhappy to write . ' Nonsense , ' said the old poet . You 've got a great opportunity right now , a whole emotion free to work with . You 're exceptionallyfortunate . A stone mason has to have the equilibriumof the stones he works with . That 's all the emotion you 're entitled to . Work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold swim , except at the end you 've got something . ' " " Such counsels he gives to us , " said Hondorp . " Oh . " And shaking his head back and forth , a semaphore of depletion , he went out , and Hendricks with a tributary back glance at Golk , followed him . " So there they go , " said Golk to Fitch , who was packing away a camera behind a flap of the cave . " My successors . The epigones . " " What 's that ? " asked Fitch . " The water after you 've washed your socks and underwear in it for a week . Stick with them , Fitch . You 'll get no more money from me . " " Do n't I know it , " said Fitch , and his mouth creased in a short smile , the equivalent in his face of all the lights in a mansion turning on at once.  |p197The  night after the last golk made under Golk 's supervision , Hendricks and Hondorp gave a party in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After they had signed the joint ownership papers , Hendricks had said , " When we break up , I 'll buy your half and you can go back to your father 's . " " I do n't believe we should calculate such possibilities so early in the game , " said Hondorp . " I look forward to many years on Sutton Place . " To her surprise , Hendricks felt the same way . She regardedHondorp and herself as somewhat unbalanced types who needed the equilibrium , however dubious , each other 's unbalance supplied . " At least , " she said , " we 'll be one arrangementof this sort where we wo n't pretend to be greaterp198than the sum of our parts . So perhaps it 'll last a lot longer than most marriages . " " Many marriages . " " All right , " she said , yielding to the equilibrium of rationality . They even discussed the possibility of having children . Seriously , if briefly . " I learned early I was my own child , " said Hendricks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselvesmuch more than most people make their children . We 'll see though . No sense in making more foreclosures than necessary . We 'll see how it looks after a year or so , if it turns out that we can manage that length . " " What would the point of children be ? " asked Hondorp , strictly for information . " The point of anything else , I suppose . Variety of experience . And there 's a big human element there too . We 're no monsters . I played with dolls as a kid . There 's something wonderful about total dependence . And total authority . We might even get to feel something new . " Hondorp kept it cool . " New feelings at our age are the sign that the old ones have n't been properly developed . " " Buster , " said Hendricks , about to say what surprised herself . " I 'm only twenty-three . You 've got fifteen years on me . " " Unbelievable , " he said . " And untrue to boot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were played out at thirteen . Or at least we 're about even . " And they went on in like manner , until , as usual with them , the chloroform of the abstract , the unrelatedness of what they said to what they felt , subdued them and sent them off to sleep . Though as they came apart in bed , Hondorp went back to the matter of children , " The golks are our off/spring now . And they last longer than the professional wailersif we take care of them right . " Hendricks was too sleepy to interpret " professional wailers " as " babies " ; she just nodded , yawned , rolled over to her side of the bed , and drowsed away . The party came a week later ; it served as hail to the new and farewell to Golk ( it was reported that he was taking a six months ' leave of absence ) , and more than this , it was both the engagement and marriage party  --  if not ceremony  --  of the hosts . Golk himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , " he said . " We 'll give ourselves a golk . The honeymoonersat the wedding breakfast . " He moved over the room and the gardened terrace signaling Pegram and Fitch to change lenses and positions , directing people to move left and right , toward or away from groups , Cecil B. DeMille at the Red Sea . " Warming up for the movies , " he said . He was supposed to be casing the West Coast . The golks took to cameras as to air ; equipment constituted no impediment at all to their ease . Indeed , they would have felt less easy without the recording paraphernalia . It made the odd occasion of departure and celebration seem normal . End of summer , end of era , end of Golk , but it was all right : it went into the cameras . You could look at it always ; age would scarcely wither it . Still , some of the inner group , Fitch , Klebba , Pegram , Elaine , were affected by the occasion , and reacted by being especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversal was , they did n't know , but that it was one , was clear to them . Their solicitude took the form of the speed and precisionto which they responded to his directions . They scurriedhere and there , tilted toward the sun or each other ,  |p200smiled  , bent , played ungolklike but lovely charades with cigarettes , curtains , themselves . It meant for some frenzy , a fringe of nerves to the ostensibly uninhibited affair . Lurcher , the company agent at the festivity , shared the feelings of the fringe . He shuttled between Golk and his successorswith a gracelessness that perfectly represented his uneasiness . He looked from face to face , and saw in each the fingers of rebuke . Except for one face , an outside one , which he could not place at first , could not in fact even distinguish as it approached him . He held out his hand and introduced himself . Poppa Hondorp responded in kind . " I 'm the father of the host , Ossip Hondorp , Doctor of Medicine . " " An honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own manner . " It 's a relief to see someone from outside our barbarous little world . " " That 's understandable , " said Poppa Hondorp , a bit shakily . He was still getting his sea legs for this world beyond the locked rectangle of his routine , office , television set , diningroom , and bed . He confessed : " For me , the adjustment is not easy . " Lurcher found no response to this ; anyway , he was remembering the unique head before him . " I saw you on the program , " burst out of him , and to Poppa Hondorp 's large smile , he added a yet larger one . " Over one hundred people have mentioned this to me , " said Poppa . " I 'm grateful for the acknowledgment . What was your opinion of the little vignette ? " " Charming , " said Lurcher . " Totally charming . I only wish that the program had continued to display like charms . " This with a backward look for possible auditors . There were none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Poppa , not from loyalty , but as the simple revelation of his existence . " And this even before my Herbert became a cog in it . " " Engrossing , yes , " said Lurcher . " I agree . Too engrossingperhaps . And this is a mighty rare remark for a network man like myself . That hoodlum , in fact , was so engrossed that for a while we kept expecting Golk 's head to come floatingdown the East River . " The remark was beyond Poppa Hondorp who had , firstly , made no distinctions between the golk victims , or at least none that would enable him to identify one as a hoodlum . The remark did strike Elaine , however . She had come up to take Poppa Hondorp 's arm close in her own . The old man felt the rare and disconcerting sensation of a woman 's body up against his own , and could barely stammer a greeting to what he finally managed to recognize as his old house guest . " A pleasure here too , Doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fitch 's camera which was boring in on him for a close-up . Poppa forgot the warmth creeping up his side in the contrivance of a benign , elderstatesmansmile , which was scarcely disturbed by Elaine 's gentle stroking of his lipoma . Poppa bowed his head , a lessonin private serenity for the American fellaheen . Dr. Parisak had sent over a case of Piper Heidsieck . It circulated now for toasts . Golk asked everyone to raise his glass toward the center of the room , and there , in the steel streaks of sunlight , there was a twang of glitter as Golk called out  --  waving Fitch back for a medium shot  --  " Somethingborrowed , something blue . Ring out the old , ring in the new . " The toast was drunk with a variety of feeling . " And to friend Golk , " cried Hendricks almost before the first swallow had passed the neck lines . " Long may he pros/per , and may he bring others to the prosperity to which he has brought us . " There was less variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Poppa Hondorp , his head filled with the two swigs of bubbly , " if I may be so bold , an outsider , as it were , though a wellwisher , and even sometime participator , a toast to the young couple which here begins its joint life , in play and work , in office and bedchamber , in the harness of harmony . " " Bravo , " called Golk , and he urged Fitch 's camera on to the trembling auxiliary head , decked out in the late afternoonlights like a whore at a wedding . Hendricks waved the servants  --  one supplied by the network  --  aroundwith the champagne . Pegram flipped a glass back against a wall . " Cheers for Old Nass , " he cried . ( His education had extended to a year at DeWitt Clinton High School . ) " Cheers , " cried Klebba , and threw his own to shatter against a reproduction of the Embarkation for Cytherea . A rage of glasses followed , some not emptied of champagne and Scotch . Golk had Benson 's camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halt , " called Poppa Hondorp . " Stop . What gives here ? Immediately halt . " Hondorp breathed relief as his father 's thunder subdued the riot . " What are you doing to the newly- "  --  a short stumble  --  " weds ' lovely house ? We must contain ourselves . " The glass-flinging ceased , to Hondorp 's surprise if not to his father 's . " A toast to my dear father , " he called , raising one of the few glasses in the room that had stayed where it belonged . " Without whom not . " There was a buzz of " Hear , hear " s , and two or three lesser golks drank the toast . The others foraged for fresh glasses . Poppa Hondorp moved overp203to his son and put his arm around his shoulders . Tears were in his eyes , and his head dipped back and forth with its shadow of flesh till he found speech . " Ein braver Bub , mein Herbert , " he got out , and he wiped his eyes on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patted his father on the back , and moved off . Enough was enough . But Golk had not had enough . An orange flew under Hondorp'snose , and as he stepped back , a grapefruit brushed fuzz at the back of his neck . The golks had found the fruit bowls and were tossing the contents back and forth across the room . " Spring training , " called Golk , whirling Fitch and Benson in with the cameras . Apples , pears , peaches , plums , nectarines , grapes , and then a persimmon , which Klebba dodged and which splattered against an ivory wall . Poppa Hondorp folded up into an armchair , his arms clasped over his heads , eyes wildly peeping out at the madness . " Plomp , " cried Golk at the persimmons , and waved Fitch in for a close shot . Hendricks tossed with the rest , flinging like a man , cracking her wrist like a ballplayer . " Zing , " she went , releasing a tangerine across the room to Gusberg , a spectacled string bean with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lanced it back to her an inch over a Spode vase mooning on the sidelines . Behind the piano crouched Lurcher , his head more conspicuouslymelonlike than ever . He had moved there when Pegram 's hand had momentarily gripped his head as if around a particularly promising missile . " I should never have come , " he told himself . " I should have guessed how that bastard would explode , once he exploded . " His chin hit the piano as he ducked a banana which , instead , tore some paint out of a real Dubuffet hanging there innocent . The fruit-throwing stopped when a cantaloupe shatteredp204a window on its way to the East Side Drive , followed four seconds later by an air-curdling shriek from the road . " Sorry , " called Golk out between the fragments . " It did n't even hit her , " he assured the others . The tempo of the party changed . The golks slumped in sofas and chairs , holding out their glasses to be filled and barely talking . They drank for hours , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prone , either in the sofas or on the floor , all but Hondorp and Golk who prowled among them like Henry V the night before Agincourt . Heads bent they walked around , until they met headonover Hendricks ' unconscious body , and looked up into each other 's bleary faces . " It 's all yours , Herbert , " said Golk slowly , and with this he tensed . Hondorp sprang back , his face awake now and contorted with terror . Then Golk shook his head , and walked out of the apartment , slamming the door so hard that Hondorp , like Ugolino in the tower , heard the lock click shut . A flag in a night breeze , Hondorp trembled for more than a minute . " I ought to count up the dead , " he thought , " including myself , " but instead , he went down the hall to his bedroom , flung himself on the bed , and slept . Hours later , when he rose , the apartment was completely empty . The maids had cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it had n't been for his clothes , wrinkled about his body like an old man 's skin , Hondorp would have had trouble believing that the party had taken place.  |p205The  first letter arrived almost a year to the day after Golk disappeared . It was addressed to Mrs. J. W. Hendricks , You 're On Camera , The Parisak Building , New York , N.Y. , and was marked " Urgently Personal . " As soon as she picked up the envelope , before she 'd remarked the handwriting , Hendricks felt that it was from Golk . Not that there was any rational support for such feeling ; she had n't been thinking of him and he had n't been heard from . Since she and Hondorp had taken over the program , their lives had proceeded with an easy rapidity and an easier success . ( In Klebba 's view , what little success there was came from rifling Golk 's files . ) Melancholy reflections , guilty regrets , and nostalgia played no parts at all in them . Golk 's disappearance caused but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was realized that his departure was in the nature of a disappearance , even this shock was dissipated in the swing of their lives . About two weeks after the party , he had called in to say he was " off for points West . Just going to scout my way around for a while , " and they had wished him luck . A week later they got a postcard from the Carlsbad Cavern Bat Caves . It went , " The bats are all rabid . Just had vision of a great golk : honeymoon couple come to sightsee here , bitten by rabid bat , and , on camera , suffer hydrophobic agonies and perish . Best to you both , G. " Neither she nor Hondorp found the card either witty or macabre ; in their view , it was but another of Golk 's misplaced efforts , a combination of a sudden notion and a sudden pique . They forgot it , and soon forgot him . They stopped wondering at his not coming back and his not explaining this in letters . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the terminology of the program . Golk 's personality was buried under the load of verbs , nouns , and adjectives which bore his name . The envelope which Hendricks slit open with her forefingernail was postmarked Puma , Arizona ; the enclosed sheet of dime-store-pad paper bore no salutation . It went as follows : When I drove out of New York last year , a strange thing happened to me . I was following a 1953 Nash station wagon  --  the kind in which the back seats fold down into a bed  --  and was staring into the face of a young woman lying down . She had an unearthly expression of weary contempt on her face and I was intrigued by it . I kept close behind the car risking life and limb at various crossings . It was on Rt . 20 in Ohio . ) The car pulled into a driveway somewhere nearp207the Indiana border , but so suddenly that I followed it up . Two uniformed men came out of the house , lifted the woman out of the seat onto a cart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral parlor . Why not ? G.The next letter came a month later from Grandview , California . By that time , Hendricks and Hondorp were more or less prepared for it . This letter seemed more remote even than the first , which had , after all , some of the flavor of a personal experience . It went : You know Newton did nearly all his good thinking before he was thirty . For the next forty or fifty years of his life , he was more and more of a crackpot . He spent his time doing crazy calculations about the beginnings of the world ( 4004 B.C. ) for instance . He believed that the secrets of the universewere inscribed on a Babylonian tablet , and that he and a few other select brainworks were occasionally given peeps at it . Who knows ? G.After she 'd read the letter , Hendricks took a sack of betel nuts out of her desk , chewed and spat out about a hundred of them . The floor was empurpled with stain , but today the nut binge did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an aggravation of the awareness that had been with her ever since she 'd thrown the first letter into her wastebasket at home . The awareness transformed her bright new office into a kind of echo chamber , a sensorium , a huge nerve against which the most ordinary sounds , sights , and smells registered with painful force . Golk 's new letter was a jabbing addition to this living palette . Hendricks let its phrases find their odd interior destinies inside her until they unleashed themselvesp208from their origin and from meaning itself . Only when this happened did she feel free of the letter . That night , though , at dinner , she went through the business with Hondorp . ( To their own surprise , they were still together on Sutton Place . ) " What 's going on with him ? " she asked . Hondorp lifted his head from a forkful of sherry-soaked crabmeat . " I 'm not sure , but I should guess that he 's seen the show and has n't liked it . He 's letting us know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about it . " Hendricks shook her head , partly at a silver dish of petits pois which a maid proffered , partly at Hondorp 's analysis . " What 's Newton got to do with all that ? Is Newton the program , good for thirty years , afterwards lousy , or what ? " Hondorp mumbled through a mouth of crab that the contents were irrelevant . " He 's just making us a sign . " Hendricks puffed smoke across the rim of a glass of Pouilly . " I 'd like to know the answer to one question : Is he with us or against us ? Is he pushing us toward the cliffs or driving us away from them ? " Hondorp crooked a finger at the maid for dessert . " Maybe he 's trying a kind of long-range golk on us , exerting pressure via letter to see if it 'll show up on the program . At any rate , he 's trying to work up some sort of contact with us again , maybe out of loneliness , maybe out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program . It 's the latter possibilitywhich works on me . If he 's concerned about the qualityof the product , he 's got a real case . We 've been turning out one hell of a product . " They looked sharply at each other , half to accuse , half to ward off accusation.  |p209Hendricks  pushed away her dessert and got up , her face knotted with disgust . " The whole business is played out . We know it . The network knows it . Everybody but the damn audience knows it , and it 's catching on . We 're boring the bejesus out of everybody , especially us . If it were n't for the damn shekels , I 'd never set foot in the place again . " " What we need is rehabilitation , " said Hondorp , and he spooned up a brown hill of mousse as if for illustration . " New air , maybe new lungs . It 's going to be hard , but our lives are on it . " The mousse was gone , and his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at almost the same view of the Queensborough Bridge that she saw from her office . The slight displacement of this evening view gave her an odd feeling , as if the two parts of her life , the night and day parts , were trying to be connected but were n't . " Or are they like the different foci of the eyes ? " she thought now , staring out at the river , a silver band binding in the island . " To get dimension , " she said out loud . " What ? " asked Hondorp , gobbling a lump of camembert from a milk cracker . The blooming plants on the terrace outside were losing their thrust and scent and color . " What are we going to do ? " she asked . Hondorp lit up a sleek Cuban cigar " Made in Havana for H. Hondorp . " " I 've been knocking it around for a couple of weeks , " he said . " One thing I know is this : we 've been too constrained , too bound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want crowd scenes , a sense of place . And New York is n't the be-and-end-all of creation either . We 'll move around the country , Missoula , Montana , Coral Gables ,  |p210Florida  , Puma , Arizona . Who knows ? Maybe even Caracas and Marseilles . We 'll live it up . " " You think moving around solves everything . That 's standard stuff , " she said . " And it never works . When a programis leaking , you do n't solve matters by trying to race it around the globe . You just leak faster . What we 're gripped by is something like gravity , something unsolvable . " Hondorp slammed a palm on the upholstered arm of his chair . " Missiles , " he said . " Get the right propulsion and you lick gravity . I know it 's hard , but it 's possible . Take that damn film of our party . A pain in the neck , but it was a new feeling , a new type of thing . Very refreshing . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can work with that for a while . " " Perhaps , " she said , distantly , as if neither this nor anything else concerned her any longer . Hondorp stared at her , long , blonde , and familiar , looking , against the windows , like bizarre , marvelous drapery . " We 're at the hot gates , " he said . " We do n't have time to fold up . Do n't let the letters get you down . I know they 're like dirt knocking into your coffin , but we ca n't let him bury us . " " Metaphors , " she said . Hondorp got up and went into his study . His exits almost always prevented their rounding the corner of disagreement into arguments and battles . It was the way they weathered those storms of temperament which years of intractability had stored up for encounters much milder than those they had on even their calmer days . The study was three ten-foot walls of books  --  bought on one ecstatic trip to Follett 's  --  a lounge , a Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled from any of the four armchairs by a switchboardbuilt into the arms just beside pads and pencils . One could never tell when key thoughts would strike , and Hondorpwas ready . Each night , he picked up the pad jottings , assembled and had them bound into red leather looseleaf books which were lined up on a special shelf close to his favorite chair . Hondorp lay back on the couch , exhorted the chandelier above his head for assistance , and waited for it . By ten thirty , it had come , and he had scribbled his " Techniques of Rehabilitation for You 're On Camera " down on a numberof the pads , collected and reread them . He went into the bedroom where Hendricks , almost aglitter in a pale blue nightgown , lay in bed reading a book in a dark-blue dust jacket called The Assistant . " Study in blue , " said Hondorp . " This is some book , " said Hendricks . " I 've got it worked out , " said Hondorp , taking off his jacket . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hendricks . Hondorp took off his shirt , threw it over a chair , andtopped it with his pants . " I 'm working in another art form , " he said . " I 'll get around to it . " " You 'll get around to nothing , " said Hendricks , turning over on her side , putting the book on a night table , and turning out her bed light . " You broke the spell . " Naked , Hondorp swept up the bed covers and lay next to her . " Such a good part , too , " she said . " Push off . " He was enough occupied with his new plans not to care one way or another . He rolled over to the other side , snored a little to annoy her , and then went off to sleep . After ap212while , she put on the bed light and finished reading the novel . The first golk in what could have been  --  but was never  --  called hondorpism was shot a month later in Comiskey Park during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , mostly for the panoramic placement which Hondorp felt was demanded by rehabilitation of the program . There were shots of the parking lots , the stadium walls , the ticket sellers , the peanut vendors , the regular television cameras and the sportscasters , the sun against the flags , the dugouts , and then faces in the crowd . " I wish we had color for it , " said Hondorpto Benson , who was carrying the audio equipment around in an ice cream vendor 's container and responding to requests for frost-sticks and Dixie cups by calling out " Empty " every minute or two . Hondorp wandered around for a while almost as he had when he was a man of leisure , taking in the smoke-blue Chicago sky , the tender green field and the noise and color of one of the few large crowds of the regular season . " I 'm going to put in for color , " he said . " It 's like operating sails in a power age . We 're not in this for the sport of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of Chicago fans to the game . No golks were planted : all were , in a sense , victims.The microphones were under the seats , and two cameras were fixed to iron pillars which framed the row . Another camera followed the game so that the reactions could be co-ordinated with the ups and downs on the field  --  " bringing in more of the world to golkdom " as Hondorp put it  --  and the fourth camera cruised with Pegram for background shots  --  " extra-dimensionality " was Hondorp 's term for this in his jottings . The editing turned out to be the big job , and back in New York the next day , Klebba and Hondorp began a backbreakingweek of putting the footage into shape . There was a natural reversal to the scene , the ten minutes of the fourth inning during which the Yankees overcame the White Sox early lead , but that was it . The rest of the golk featured the increasing depression on the ten faces in the row . Hondorp tried to pad the mute drama with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary of Baseballin Chicago or American Spectator Sports , but the centerwas soft and nothing really held on to it . The night before it was to be telecast , Hondorp wrote a humorous narrative to sew it together , and this helped somewhat , but as he and Hendricks watched it the next night ( each on a different set in case of mechanical failure ) , they both saw ineptitude and failure leaking out of the screen . They saw something else too . About three-quarters of the way through , each of them gasped , and then heard the other 's gasp as a confirmatory echo . " Was it really there ? " asked Hendricks , the sounds fuelingmore on intake than exhalation . " Keep watching , " said Hondorp tensely , leaning forward as if proximity to the glass would conjure there the image he sought . When the program ended , they did not discuss its defects . Only the apparition in one of the back rows during a backgroundshot of the crowd . " It could n't have been he , " saidp214Hondorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And in Chicago . A week ago he was in Arizona or someplace . " " It was he , " said Hendricks dully . " You could see him three or four seconds . " Toward the side of the frame the great skull had caught up the sunlight and focused the frame on itself . " Everything in the scene seemed to be pointing to that auk 's egg of his . " " The baldness throws us , " said Hondorp . " Bald men look alike . The way Chinamen do to Westerners . Or Westernersto Chinese , " he added in fairness . " The shot was n't the world 's clearest , " she conceded . " Not that any of the camera work was very good considering all the sun you had out there . " Hondorp ignored the general criticism , and took to bed with him the problem of Golk 's presence at the game . The next day he asked the golks at the office if they 'd noticed anything peculiar . The inner circle thought they had seen Golk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more than they did to anything else in the universe , quotidian or miraculous . Facts were facts , and life itself was technics . Elaine , however , drew on disowned tribal memories of witchcraft for her account of it . " That old sonovabitch is hexing us . " Hondorp reached a hand over to cradle a breast . " Do n't phutz around , " she said . " We 're in for it , and I 'm no one to jitterbug at a funeral . " The only critique of the show panned it as " diffuse and pointless , " and pointed to a general weakening in the qualityof the program . The golks felt the same way about it . " We 're just starting , " said Hondorp in response . " It 'll take us a little while to bring this crowd stuff off , " but heart lagged behind words . Two days later , they tried again , up in Groton , Connect/icut , at the launching of a new atomic submarine . Klebba , in coveralls and denim workshirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the V.I.P. platform on the grounds that he 'd helped build the sub . An argument started , abetted by a golk or two , and spread from the platform to the crowd surrounding it . Police took Klebba off where Hondorp waited with the release slip signed by the Commandant of the area who had not quite understood the nature of the " television coverage . " The editing job here was simpler , and the golk seemed much more successful than the first . In the preliminary screening , that is . The night of the telecast , Hendricks and Hondorp again watched at home . Two minutes after the golk began , they saw the skull . It was up near the bald prow of the ship , at the fringe of the crowd , and for a moment , it looked as if there had been a double exposure of the picture , or as if another submarine had surfaced alongside the debutant . The skull gleamed in the background of three or four minutes of footage , and each time it appeared , Hondorp felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendricks said a word until it was over . Then Hondorp yelled , " How could he know where we 'd be ? " He was amazed , frightened , and fiercely angry . " Do n't look at me , " said Hendricks . " For my money , we 're just seeing things . " The next day , Hondorp ran the film through a scanner , slowed it at the proper frames , cut a couple out , and looked at them under an enlarger . A bald head , which might or might not have been Golk 's , showed up . " She 's right , " said Hondorp to himself . " We 're seeing things . " But the inner circle of golks had seen it too . " I 'm heading off , " said Elaine ,  |p216as  Hondorp came back to his office . " I 've had it . I 'm packing . " Hondorp cut the air with a fierce look of contempt . " Head off , " he said . " You chicken spade . " " Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doomed , pally . I 'm going to save what little of this distinguished skin is there to be saved . The program 's had it . Here , " and she tossed him an envelope with a gold " P " on front and back . Hondorp slammed the door , and read the memorandum . " Your program seems to be losing fire , " it went . " I offer you this word as a reminder that no one can coast in the world of entertainment , or in any other for that matter . Entertainmentmust entertain . When it ceases to entertain , it must be replaced . Your Trendex and Hooper correspond in showing a 6 per cent drop from your last offering . This is the third consecutive drop for the program . I wish you luck . P. " That afternoon , another letter came , this time to Hondorp . It was postmarked Sioux Falls , Iowa , and had been mailed the day they had shot the scene in Groton . It went : A professor in Iowa City the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Golk " is a real word , and he told me to look it up in this dictionary of all the English words . It 's spelled a few different ways , but they all mean " cuckoo " or " fool . " For instance , the dictionary quotes a poem written three hundred years ago : " Art thou a god ? No  --  but a gok disguysit . " " Gok " is one of the ways you spell it . It means " fool " there . " To hunt the gowk " means to go on a fool 's errand . Happy hunting . G.It was raining in New York , and the sky and buildings looked in on Hondorp sick with the pockmarks of the weather . The rain beat against his window as if inside hisp217skin . He stretched his arms out on his desk and put his head down . " A gok disguised , " he said out loud . " A gok disguised , " his voice came back . His arm had released the dictaphoneswitch . Hondorp slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's cut out this shit . " The machine played it back , and Hondorp gave it the back of his hand , and sent it flying against the wall . He went over to the window and regarded the liquefaction of the city till his own tension deliquesced as well . One evening , just about two weeks before You 're on Camera went off the air , Poppa Hondorp , while watching Person to Person , fell off his armchair . By the time his lipoma smashed against the rug he was dead . Coronary occlusion . Marie discoveredhim at breakfast time and called Hondorp who taxied up to Central Park after telephoning a crematorium . Poppa Hondorp was burned to his ashes before sundown . Hondorp pled religious reasons for the rapidity although no prayers were said at the ceremony . Indeed , there was no ceremony . And no one  --  including Hondorp  --  was present but the men who carried in the body and carried out the ashes . After some thought , Hondorp composed the following notice and carried it down himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died yesterday at his home , 643 Pleasant Avenue , Brooklyn . There are no survivors . " The Times did not print the notice , only the name Osip Ondhorp . And so Poppa Hondorp became one of the very few New Yorkers whose passing received no space at all in the great newspaper.  |p218Two  days later , Hendricks asked Hondorp if he 'd had their weekly call from Poppa . " He died last Friday , " said Hondorp . After a long , interpreting pause , Hendricks looked up into her partner 's face , and said , " That 's it . That 's it . " " A pity , " said Hondorp . The war had broken out ; he was only surprised that there had been so long a peace . " Golk 's knives were rubber . He played to scare , not to kill . You 're for real . A Capone . " " You want root and stalk , but you wo n't wait for the flower , " said Hondorp , his eyes soft but full of the misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some do n't . If you play , you can take any side you want any time you want to . You can change courts , change your strokes , change your partners , change yourself . Because when you 're playing , nothing counts , the game , your partners , your self . You do n't exist . One-third of a century it took me to work that out . If you think the cocoon can stop the wings from breakingout of its sides , you do n't understand anything . You do n't care for anything . Go on and weep . " She breathed as if air were new to her lungs , as if lungs were new in her body . " You think it all follows naturally , that honesty drives you to your prey . I 'll tell you boy that that 's just it , that 's why I 'm getting off . I can cross myself up and not feel I 've committed treason . I do n't kneel down to what I was , nor to what I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've outrun yourself . The motion going on in you now is sheer mechanics . Wings ! The only move you make is to change your own oil . Somnam-bulist . " " You learned nothing . " " I learned this , " she said , walked the two feet whichp219separated them , put her face into kissing position and said gently , " You 're dead . You 're extinct . You ca n't ever come back . I 'm packing . " " Naturally , " said IIondorp . He was well rid of her : she had gotten off the train before her ticket lapsed . Though there were but two weeks left in their contracts , none of the inner circle remained . Hondorp realized that it was Hendricks who had advised them to get out . Fitch and Benson sent identical notes , excusing themselves for leaving before the actual end but pleading opportunities in West Coast television . A month later , when the You 're On Camera offices had been taken over by a program called Name Your Risk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's  --  Hondorp was back in his father 's apartment  --  he passed Fitch on Sixth Avenue . He started to ask " What about the West Coast ? " but the ship 's head dipped into the crowd and Fitch was gone . As far as Hondorp could learn , neither he nor any other golks of the inner circle ever worked in televisionagain . Two months after he had seen Fitch , Hondorp was certain that he saw Klebba at the wheel of a taxi going into the Vanderbilt Avenue entrance of Grand Central Station . He himself was headed for Chicago . A radio station there was looking for a disc jockey , and Hondorp 's response to the advertisement in Radio News had drawn a promising answer.  |p220He  never saw any of the other golks again , at least in person , though in a newsreel shot of a horserace at Longchamps , he had a brief clear view of Hendricks . She was attached to the arm of the most brutal-looking man Hondorp had ever seen , and his first reaction was the amazed thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly started one of the dizzy spells he occasionally suffered now , so he drove it out of mind . " I 've been seeing things again , " he told himself . His schedule kept him quite busy . His hours were from midnight to six A.M. ; then he ate a large breakfast , took a walk , and then slept until four or five in the afternoon . After dinner , he sometimes went to a movie or to one of the noncreditcourses at the Downtown College of the University of Chicago . He found it hard to study though , or even to read , especially as the rest of his time was spent in keeping up with the popular songs . He worked six days a week . On Thursdays  --  his day off  --  he sometimes cruised the streets , pretending that he was scouting golks . Golk himself , he saw once more . There was no question at all about this , although the circumstances were unlikely enough . It was in the summer of 1957 . Hondorp was taking his two-week vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . He took an occasional afternoon to go sightseeing , and one afternoon found him going through the Paramount lot on the regular studio tour . Only one movie was shooting , and the tour watched a scene being shot . A mob of people were crowding through the doors of a bank whose funds had been embezzled by the lovable old bank president . The set consisted of the great facade of the buildingwhich was fastened to girders by immense ropes looped high above the arc lights shining down on the crowd . Two orp221three scene-shifters were up in the ropes , holding them tight on the girders against the surge of the crowds . One of the shifters was Golk . There was no question about it . In the darkness above the mikes and cameras and lights , his great skull was lit , a cold , brooding moon above the scene . Even from the separating distance , Hondorp could see that he looked older , and fatter ; but , as always , he fitted in . He belonged . His stubby legs were pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stretched along two ropes . He functioned . Hondorp was just about to shout up at him , when , with a portion of that mysterious insight which always cowed the golks , he looked down , saw Hondorp , smiled , and waved his palm to the right , almost losing his grip on one of the ropes . Hondorp returned the salute , then turned around and walked out of the studio . That night , although he had a week 's vacation time left , he took the train back to Chicago , all trace of his ambition , all desire for change gone absolutely and forever.
