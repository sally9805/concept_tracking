In Jerusalem last week , more than 1,600 rabbis and laymen gathered at the marble-colonnaded Hechal Shlomo ( Solomon 's Palace ) for the first world conference of Orthodox Jewry . Although Orthodoxy is traditionally associated with the ghettos of Europe , more than a fourth of the delegates were American ; mingling with rabbis wearing beards and ankle-length frock coats were clean-shaven men in business suits . Conversation turned on how to preserve religious tradition , but there were also lengthy debates on such present-day problems as how to reach out to the religiously alienated Jew . <P> The mixture of old and new at the conference was an apt symbol of the state of Orthodoxy , the largest of Judaism 's three branches . About a quarter of the 5,600,000 Jews in the U.S. are Orthodox . Elsewhere , a Jew who is at all religiously observant will , more often than not , be Orthodox ; of Israel 's 6,000 synagogues , only nine are nonOrthodox . Far more than Reform or Conservative Judaism , Orthodoxy lives by the letter of God 's law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired and insists that the God-fearing Jew must keep every one of the 613 rules of Halaka-the Scripture-based religious law that forbids servile work on the Sabbath , prohibits the eating of meat and dairy food at the same meal , and prescribes ritual bathing for men and women at certain times . Until a generation ago , Orthodox Jewry was also distinguished by its hostility and indifference to the secular world , and its adherents lived clannishly together in urban ghettos-as the fervent Hasidic sects still do . <P> Native-Born Leaders . World War II marked the beginning of a change for Orthodoxy . Hitler 's holocaust wiped out the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe , where most of Orthodoxy 's spiritual leaders lived ; Orthodox communities elsewhere started to develop more of their own native-born leaders , many of whom were less inhibited by tradition-and were shaken by the fact that thousands of young Jews were abandoning the faith for less rigorous branches of Judaism , or for no faith at all . <P> The changing outlook of Orthodoxy is most striking in the U.S. Halakic proscriptions have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed from burdensome don'ts to more appealing dos . For example , youths are no longer simply ordered to observe the Sabbath , but are reminded that by honoring it they will become more faithful Jews . Where Orthodox Jews once limited themselves to a handful of chosen professions-the jewelry or garment business , for example-they now are taking jobs that would have been unthinkable to their grandparents . There is even an Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists , with more than 1,000 members .
