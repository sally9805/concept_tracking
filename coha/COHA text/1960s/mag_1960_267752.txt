" I am interested , " says Alan Hovhaness , " only in serenity of the mind . " In his search for it , Composer Hovhaness is traveling around the world , and during the trip-working in railway coaches , airplanes , steamy hotel rooms-he has serenely turned out four symphonies , one opera , a concerto and four piano pieces . Last week in Tokyo he displayed some of the fruits of serenity to warmly applauding Japanese . <P> In his 49 years , estimates Composer Hovhaness , he has probably written 1,200 pieces , including 16 symphonies . In 1943 he destroyed almost everything he had written up to that point-seven symphonies and packing cases full of shorter works with which he was dissatisfied-but he still remains a prolific and widely performed composer . <P> Much of his music , by his own testimony , " derives from a time and place different than ours-from ancient principles and ancient cultures . The study of Eastern music is my lifework . " A largely self-taught composer , Hovhaness owes more to the ragas of India and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the European modernists under whose influence most U.S. composers are reared . In the streets of India and the theaters of Japan , says Hovhaness , he heard oblique echoes of his own work . <P> Delphian Grandeur . The compositions of Alan Hovhaness , wrote one Japanese critic , " are like Japanese scrolls . As they are rolled out , they reveal new images and their message bit by bit . Western classical music in comparison is like a photographic print . " Japanese audiences heard Hovhaness conduct several of his older works-Psalm and Fugue , the 28-minute Concerto No. 8-plus two brand-new works written in transit : Symphony No. 8 , subtitled " Arjuna , " after the name of a mythical hero from Indian folklore ; and the choral piece Fuji ( based on an 8th century Japanese poem beginning : " As I stepped out on the beach of Tago , I saw snow falling on Mount Fuji " ) . <P> The Japanese were intrigued by Hovhaness ' trancelike , tranquilly breathing music , with its long , curving melodic lines running side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern dance patterns , its little swirling eddies of sound . So far , Japanese audiences have not heard the Hovhaness work most frequently played in the U.S.-Mysterious Mountain , a spacious , broadly flowing 17-minute work that conveys an almost Delphian sense of grandeur .
