At the Aeromedical Field Laboratory , Holloman Air Force Base , New Mexico , about 20 chimponauts have almost finished their training this week for the fur-raising duty of pioneering in space psychology . Presumably they will teach their tormentors whether a spaceborne man will be psychologically capable of managing the instruments and communications of his swiftly moving craft . Since chimps are easier to train before they reach puberty , the pioneers are all relatively younger than the seven human astronauts , all married and fathers , who are training for the Mercury man-in-space program . Of the more promising chimponauts , only one is American-born ( the Fresno , Calif , zoo ) ; the rest were captured in the jungles of equatorial Africa . <P> Cuddled Recruits . Candidates for chimponaut training are first screened for alertness and proper age ( under three years ) . They are given numbers and dog tags like other Air Force recruits and are isolated for 45 days for detailed health checkups . Because juvenile chimps need loving care , they get plenty of cuddling and attention from human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stabilization colony , where they learn the chummy customs of chimp society . Then they are ready for work . <P> Every morning after a light breakfast of fruit and special chimp chow the chimponauts are given medical examinations and driven in a panel truck to the testing center of the laboratory 's Comparative Psychology Branch . There they are taught to wear carefully fitted space suits and to tolerate being strapped for long periods on softly padded contour couches . They are taken up in stunting aircraft to get accustomed to sudden noise , vibration and G forces , and to learn what weightlessness feels like . Even before they have been hardened to all these physiological " insults , " their psychological training has begun . <P> " We are concerned with the effectiveness of an animal in space , " says Major Fred H. Rohles , chief of the Comparative Psychology Branch . " Before a man is lifted into space , we must learn whether an animal in space can perform tasks that it has learned on the ground . If the animal 's sensory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tasks , we must assume that a man suffering the same impairment will be ineffective as a monitor pf dials or as an accurate reporter of information . " <P> Defeated VIP . A typical task taught to chimponauts requires them to watch three shapes flashed on a screen and decide by pushing the proper lever which shape is not like either of the others . By doing this correctly 18 times , a chimp earns a banana-flavored food pellet . Some of them become amazingly skillful . The champion so far is a chimp that worked the levers 7,000 times in 70 minutes with only 32 errors . A human VIP visiting the lab rashly tried the same task and made a much lower score .
