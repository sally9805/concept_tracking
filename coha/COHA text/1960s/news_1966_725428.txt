txt When Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi comes to Washington Monday she will see plenty of women . President Johnson intends to surround her with them . At a White House reception , India 's chief of state will meet many of the 105 women the President has named to full or part-time executive posts and some of the 2,500 top government career women . The President often boasts about how many women figure in his administration . Yet the presence of Mrs. Gandhi will point up another side of the story  --  that Mr. Johnson has n't a single woman in a high policy position either in the , State or Defense Departments or on the White House staff . Perhaps the highest placed woman in Washington is Esther Peterson , the President 's Assistant on Consumer Affairs . But she has little policymaking influence . Mr. Johnson also can introduce Mrs. Gandhi to a distaff Assistant Secretary of Agriculture . He has named three women ambassadors . And he has a woman seated on each of four top-level commissions . Congress may soon unholster the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only two federal laws now control gun sales  --  the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Federal Firearms Act of 1939 . A new mail-order gun bill has just passed a Senate subcommittee . It has gone to the full Senate Judiciary Committee and is expected eventually to pass in the Senate . A big fight , however , looms in the House . Passage there is uncertain , but the bill 's backers are hopeful . The Senate measure is a compromise . The original bill would have lumped rifles with small weapons in the mail-order ban . Pressure groups tried to pry rifles loose from the entire bill . But rifles finally stayed  --  not banned , but at least regulated . That controversial issue of prayer in the schools may be gathering for another sortie into public view . Illinois Republican Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen has a constitutional amendment ready that would allow youngsters voluntarily to participate in prayers in public schools . He is looking around now for support . He objects to past Supreme Court decisions banning prayer in public schools and thinks 81 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , is " a simple amendment . It is voluntary . It is permissive . It places the responsibility upon local school authorities . " He has yet to spell out his strategy . He may ask for hearings . Or he might try to take the amendment straight to the Senate floor . Trends ... Pennsylvania Republicans rake in about $300,000 selling corporate ads in an annual party booklet . They ca n't do that any more . Pennsylvania Democrats last year put out a similar book to help finance the governor race . But now that 's forbidden . And state politicians in both parties are shaking their fists at Sen. John J. Williams ( R ) of Delaware . He put an inconspicuous amendment banning such political ad books into the just-passed tax bill . The amendment intended to say " never again " to such extravagant political ad books as the Democratic National Committee 's " Toward an Age of Greatness , " which was chock-full of $15,000-a-page corporate ads . The GOP published a similar book . Both included ads by the nation 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political shakedown . But the law also halts less ambitious fund-raising books on state and local political levels . GOP organizations in 31 states had depended on this means of moneymaking ; Democrats probably as many . The Williams amendment now may force politicians to seek other ways of financing parties  --  making small campaign contributions tax exempt , for instance . How and why ? ? ? President Johnson is relaxed about the smothering barrage of proposals he is dumping on Congress this year . Most of his messages are jam packed with many-splendored new projects devised by his task forces . Each task force produced dozens of new ideas of the sort the President eagerly seeks . He could n't bear not to include them . The President does n't expect many of them to be turned into legislation this year . He thinks it sufficient to bring them to public notice . The task forces are thus vindicated . And , who knows , many of them may make the " must " list next year .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
