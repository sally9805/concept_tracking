When some executives of the bathroom fixtures industry gathered at their trade association meeting seven years ago , it seemed only natural that they get together over cocktails in the Sheraton-Chicago Hotel room of Daniel Quinn . He was then president of the Plumbing Fixture Manufacturers Association and a vice president of American Standard Inc. , the industry leader . Congeniality was the order of the day . <P> William Kramer , executive secretary of the P.F.M.A. , thought that the conversation centered more on price-fixing than football . As a result , he used a hidden recorder to keep track of subsequent conversations among industry executives . In 1963 , Kramer fled to the Caribbean with $175,000 of the association 's money and a stack of potentially damaging tapes . Later he was arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for writing bad checks and several other offenses . Soon afterwards , his tapes turned up at the Justice Department , whose subsequent investigation uncovered evidence of widespread price-fixing in the industry . Justice won two indictments charging 15 companies , eight high executives and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig prices . <P> Collective Bargaining . Two weeks ago , a federal court jury in Pittsburgh handed down a guilty verdict . Convicted of violating the Sherman Act were American Standard , Kohler Co. , and Borg-Warner Corp. - along with Daniel Quinn , Vice President Norman R. Held of Kohler and Joseph J. Decker , manager of product coordination at American Standard . Last year the other twelve companies , * the P.F.M.A. and five executives had decided not to fight the charges ; all pleaded " no contest . " The courts levied fines totaling $712,500 , and the executives served jail sentences of from one to 30 days . <P> The companies that chose to fight - American Standard , Kohler and Borg-Warner-were accused of conspiring to boost the prices of bathroom fixtures , collectively regulating trade discounts and agreeing to drop cheaper lines . The charges held that an informal cartel operated from 1962 to 1966 . <P> Avoiding the Stains . The three companies and the executives are appealing the decision . They point out that the price of bathtubs , for example , fell from $49.59 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in operation . Further , they contend that the lines dropped from production were inferior products that could be stained by modern detergents and no longer met standards set by the Department of Commerce . <P> The real impact on the companies is yet to come . Already more than 500 suits have been filed by individuals , cities and states , most seeking triple damages from the companies . If the guilty verdicts survive appeal , and precedents involving the electrical and drug industries continue to serve-as guidelines , the damages could ultimately total billions of dollars . <P> <P> * Crane Co. , Universal-Rundle Corp. , Briggs Manufacturing Co. , Gerber Plumbing Fixtures Corp. , Ogden Corp. , Mansfield Sanitary Inc. , Peerless Pottery Inc. , Kilgore Ceramics Corp. , Lawndale Industries Inc. , Georgia Sanitary Pottery Inc. , Wallace-Murray Corp. , Rheem Manufacturing Co.
