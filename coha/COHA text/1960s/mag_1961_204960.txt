U.N . officials began picking up the tag ends of the world 's business where Dag Hammarskjold had left it . <P> The precarious Congo operation was being run last week by the men who had been Hammarskjold 's chief assistants-the U.S. 's Under Secretaries Andrew Cordier and Ralph Bunche . India 's Under Secretary Chakravarthi Narasimhan-now dubbed the " Congo Club . " By vote of the General Assembly . West Africa 's Sierra Leone ( pop . 2,500,000 ; area 27,940 sq . mi. ) became the U.N . ' s 100th member , just before the Security Council settled down near by to fight over Russia 's package deal on two other membership applications , those of Mauritania and Outer Mongolia-a knotty problem that might affect the fate of Red China 's bid for admission later . <P> <P> Meanwhile . Assembly President Mongi Slim bustled about the corridors , dickering , discussing and listening to all sides of the unsettled argument over the succession to Dag Hammarskjold 's vacant post of Secretary-General . The Soviet plan no longer encompassed merely a troika , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a four-man body-two neutralists ( African and Asian ) , a Communist and a Westerner - each , presumably , with a veto over the others that would render the whole operation useless . Said one U.N . diplomat : " You could call them the four Marxist Brothers . " <P> While the more or less routine machinery of the U.N . thus somehow kept going , the biggest events of the U.N . week remained the speeches . <P> Kennedy : Flexibility . John Kennedy was , as even Gromyko acknowledged , " in great form . " His speech was generally well received for its eloquence , earnest warmth and restraint . These good marks were not only a tribute to Kennedy , but also a sign that the U.N . manages to draw considerable eloquence from U.S. Presidents - acting on them somewhat the way a nominating convention affects U.S. Governors . Applause was warm and loud for three of Kennedy 's phrases , which kept echoing through U.N . corridors all week : <P> &gt; On the Soviet proposal for a split U.N . executive , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three drivers , all going in different directions ; they had only one and so must the U.N . " <P> &gt; On disarmament , " Mankind must abolish war or war will abolish mankind . " <P> &gt; On U.S. determination ( a replay from his inaugural ) , " We shall neither flee nor invoke the threat of force . We shall never negotiate out of fear and we shall never fear to negotiate . "
