txt Cafe-Pavilion Plan For Central Park Is Upheld by Court By JOHN SIBLEY Supreme Court Justice Jacob Markowitz ruled yesterday that the city could build the proposed Huntington Hartford pavilion and outdoor cafe in Central Park . In an involved three-year legal fight , a group led by Walter Hoving , president of Tiffany &; Co. , has contended ( that the project would be an illegal use of park land . The ; proposal has also been opposed ) by several civic organizations , among them the Park Associ- ! ation of the City of New York and the Municipal Art Society . Mr. Hoving said late yesterday he was considering an appeal . " I 'm not surprised at Judge Markowitz 's decision , " he said . " He refused to let us call all our witnesses and insisted upon hurrying us . He arbitrarily cut it off . " Mr. Hartford , heir to the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Company fortune , offered in 1960 to give the city $862,500 for the construction of the pavilion . His offer was accepted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARK CAFE PLAN UPHELD BY COURT // Edward D. Stone for the south- , east corner of the park , at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street . It is expected to cost about $1,500,000 . In his original offer , Mr. Hartford , said that if the cost should exceed $862,500 he would donate the difference to the Department of Parks . After legal preliminaries that I went to the state 's highest ' court , the Court of Appeals , the case went on trial before Justice Markowitz on June 17 . In a 17-page opinion yesterday , Justice Markowitz said : " In my judgment , the proposed Hartford Pavilion will enhance the beauty and natural appeal of the southeast corner of Central Park without destroying the tone and character of upper Fifth Avenue . " Objections Raised The Hoving group had brought the suit on the ground , that the Parks Commissioner had no power to undertake the project . Specifically , these objections were raised : 9The restaurant would destroy " a rural area " by removing trees , footpaths and lawns . CR would block one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk " many thousands of feet further . " 9The restaurant would compete unfairly with the many private , taxpaying eating and drinking places in the area . 9It would add to the already congested traffic in the area . CR would not cater principally to people using the park , and would be too expensive for the general public . The suit was brought under Section 51 of the state 's General Municipal Law , which permits taxpayers to sue " to prevent any illegal official act on the part of municipal officers , agents , commissioners or other persons , or to prevent waste or injury to . . . any municipal property . " Justice Markowitz said that previous court rulings had interpreted this quite narrowly , and that a taxpayer had to prove either corruption or " total lack of power " on the part of a public official to succeed in such an action . The Court noted that-no corruption had been alleged , and ruled that the pavilion project would not exceed the power of the Commissioner of Parks as defined in the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not question the Parks Commissioner 's judgment " even if it be shown to be illfounded and unwise . " However , his decision applauded the pavilion as an ideal use of the park corner . It said : " The contemplated structure is of a design and character ? has a ' feel ' to it ? which expresses joy , openness and light , and , according to the expert testimony , it is of a type which has long been found as a part of parks in this country as well as western Europe . " Rather than turning park land into city pavement , as the complaint suggests , Hartford Pavilion promises to refurbish and extend the present dimensions of Central Park by a unique , distinctive and cultural addition . " It is as natural to the park as a boathouse is to a lake . MI all likelihood it will be considered in the future as one of the finest of its kind in the United States . " The document closed with a , nod to the donor , saying : " As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sion that few men have labored so long , against such strenuous ' opposition , to give upward of al million dollars away for a beneficial public purpose . " Mr. Hoving was represented at the trial by former Supreme Court Justice William Rand Jr. , the city by Assistant Corporation Counsel Milton Weinberg.
