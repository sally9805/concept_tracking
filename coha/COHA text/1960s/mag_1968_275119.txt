THE LESSONS OF HISTORY by Will and Ariel Durant. 117 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $5 . <P> <P> When the tenth and final volume of their massive The Story of Civilization appeared last year , Historians Will ( 82 ) and Ariel ( 70 ) Durant promised readers one last postlude volume distilling the observations and conclusions of their 40-odd years of scholarship . <P> In The Lessons of History , the Durants do not set themselves up as oracles . On the contrary , they are disarmingly honest in admitting that all historians operate with partial knowledge , and that any belief that they can examine a past epoch with total perspective is largely an optical illusion . " Most history is guessing , " they confess , " and the rest is prejudice . " Still , in their long tour through history , the Durants have reached some conclusions . A major one is that man , and not his environment , makes civilization . Over and over again , they submit , man has proved his capacity to make a culture when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The Durants admit they can find no substantial change in man 's basic nature in the uncountable centuries since he first appeared out of the murk of prehistory . All technological advances actually can be written off " as new means of achieving old ends-the acquisition of goods , the pursuit of one sex by the other ( or by the same ) , the overcoming of competition , the fighting of wars . " <P> Yet the Durants reject the gloomy view that man is in a dismal rut . Modern existence , precarious , chaotic and murderous as it is , is a vast improvement over the ignorance , superstition , violence and disease of earlier periods . They ask : Are we ready to scuttle the technology that has spread food , home ownership , comfort , education and lei sure beyond any precedent ? Would we rather have lived under the laws of the Athenian Republic or the Roman Empire than under constitutions that give us habeas corpus , trial by jury , religious and intellectual freedom and the emancipation of women ? <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before in history- " richer than that of Pericles , for it includes all the Greek flowering that followed him ; richer than Leonardo 's , for it includes him and the Italian Renaissance ; richer than Voltaire 's , for it embraces all the French Enlightenment . " Furthermore , they foresee no limits to man 's long upward journey . " If progress is real despite our whining , " they conclude , " it is not because we are born any healthier , better or wiser than infants were in the past , but because we were born to a richer heritage , born on a higher level of that pedestal which the accumulation of knowledge and art raises as the ground and support of our being .
