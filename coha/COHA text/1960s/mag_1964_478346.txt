When you get to Chicago , go and see Nelson Algren for me , " a young intellectual told me when I was in New York in 1947 . I have given a faithful account of my first meeting with him in my book America Day by Day ? our evening in the lower depths of the city and the following afternoon spent in the bars of the Polish district ; but I did not mention the rapport that immediately sprang up between us , nor how disappointed we were not to be able to have dinner together . I called him before I left for the railroad station ; they had to take the telephone away from me by force . On the train to Los Angeles I read one of his books and thought about him ; he lived in a hovel , without a bathroom or refrigerator , alongside an alley full of steaming trash cans and flapping newspapers ; this poverty seemed refreshing after the heavy odor of dollars in the big hotels and the elegant restaurants , which I had found hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said to myself ; Algren had asked me to , and I wanted to ; but if we found this parting painful already , would n't the next one hurt us even more ? The weeks passed ; Sartre asked me in one of his letters to postpone my departure because M. was staying another ten days in Paris . Suddenlythat made me feel the nostalgia I described Anne as feeling in my novel The Mandarins : I 'd had enough of being a tourist ; I wanted to walk about on the arm of a man who , temporarily , would be mine . I called Algren , " Can you come here ? " I asked him . He could n't , but he would like very much to see me in Chicago . Our first day together was very much like the one Anne and Lewis spent together in The Mandarins ; embarrassment , impatience , misunderstanding , fatigue , and finally the intoxication of deep understanding . I stayed in Chicago only three days ; I had a great many things to settle in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was the first time he 'd been in an airplane . I went around shopping , saying goodbye ; at about five in the afternoon I came back to our room and we stayed with each other until the next morning . People would often talk about him to me ; they said he was unstable , moody , even neurotic ; I liked tieing the only one who understood him , If he was sometimes blunt and rude , as people claimed , it was certainly only as a defense ; he really cared about people . I told him , before I left him , that my life was permanently fixed in Paris ; he believed me without at all understanding what I meant . I promised C ) Editions Gallimard 1963. ? 1964. by G. P. Putnam 's Sons 112 AN AMERICAN RENDEZVOUS him we should see each other again , but we did not know when or how , and I arrived in Paris in a dreadful state . Sartre was in trouble too . Before getting on the boat to France , M. had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do everything I can to make you ask me to stay . " He had n't asked her to stay . She wanted to prolong her visit until July . Although she had been very friendly with me in New York , she did not really like me . In order to avoid friction , I went with Sartre to live in a little hotel on the outskirts of Paris ; it was almost the country ? there were roses in the garden , cows in the meadows , and I worked outside in the sun . We went for walks along the path Jean Racine used to use , overgrown with grass and splattered with bad alexandrines . On certain evenings Sartre would go into Paris to meet M. This way of life would have suited me if she had been satisfied with it ? but no . The evenings when Sartre stayed with me he would receive dramatic telephone calls from her . She could not accept his letting her go away again . But how could he do otherwise ? The circumstances were not favorable to compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , sacrificing her job , her friendships , everything to which she was accustomed , she would be entitled to expect everything from Sartre ; and Lhat was more than he was able to offer . But if he loved her , how could he bear not to see her for months at a time ? He listened to her complaints with remorse ; he felt that he was to blame . Of course he had warned her : there could be no question of his making a life with her . But by saying that he loved her he gave the lie to that warning ; for ? especially in the eyes of women ? love triumphs over every obstacle . Perhaps he had been thoughtless not to have realized this ; his excuse was that , while refusing to alter his relationship with me , he cared for her intensely and wanted to believe that some compromise solution could be found . I went through two painful months . My resolution was insufficient to cut myself off completely from America ; I decided to return to Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for days . The moment we looked at each other again , I knew I had been right to come back . It was during these two weeks that I discovered Chicago ? the prisons , the police stations and the lineups , the hospitals , the stockyards , the burlesque houses , the slums . Again Algren asked me to stay with him for good , and I explained that this was impossible . But we parted less sadly than in May because in the spring of 1948 I was to return so that we could take a trip together lasting several months , down the Mississippi and then to Mexico . Down the Mississippi Sartre was getting very gloomy letters from M. ; she had reluctantly agreed to spend four months with him while I was on my trip with Algren , A few days before I was due to leave , she wrote to Sartre saying that on those conditions she had decided not to see him again . This threw me into a great perplexity . I wanted enormously to be back with Algren , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to me . The question would have been an idle one if circumstances had decided for me , but suddenly I had a choice : knowing that I could have stayed with Sartre , I was leaving myself open to regrets which might turn into a grudge against Algren , or at least into bitterness against myself . I opted for a half measure ? two months of America instead of four . This time I took a plane that flew high and fast . It landed me at LaGuardia . My visa gave the purpose of my trip as " lectures . " " On what ? " the immigration official asked me ; when I said philosophy he shuddered : " What philosophy ? " He allowed me five minutes to give him a brief account . I said it was impossible . has it got anything to do with politics ? Are you a Communist ? You would n't admit it if you were . " I got the impression that any French person was suspect a priori . After having consulted some files , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after that , I landed in Chicago . Algren took me in the afternoon to visit a gang of junky thieves whom I simply had to visit , according to him ; I spent two hours in a filthy den , surrounded Simone de Beauvoir 's works of fiction and social exploration ? including " The Mandarins " and " The Second Sex " ? have made her international reputation as a writer and a leader of the Existentialist movement . The two articles published in " Harper 's " are adapted from the new volume of her autobiography which will be brought out in New York by G. P. Putnam 's Sons in the spring , with the title , " The Force of Circumstance . " Last month , the first article dealt with some aspects of the author 's thirty-year association with Jean-Paul Sartre and their philosophic and personal encounters with other writers in Paris and New York in the postwar years . by strangers talking , too fast for me to follow , to other strangers . All they really enjoyed was to be with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a day of repressed but frantic agitation we took the morning train for Cincinnati ; the evening of the following day we embarked on a side-wheeler . I loved the monotony of the voyage through this wide watery landscape . On the deck in the sun . I translated one of Algren 's stories , I read , and we chatted over glasses of Scotch . Algren kept trying to take photographs with a German camera he did n't understand ; he was quite satisfied because he had managed to get a tiny noise out of it when he pressed the catch . In the evening light , I saw the waters of the Ohio mingle with those of the Mississippi ? I had dreamed of the Mississippi , listening to " Old Man River " and also while I was writing All Men Are Mortal . But I could never have imagined the enchantment of its evenings , its moons . Each day we went ashore for a few hours . Louisville , sinister in the rain ; a little town in Kentucky with decrepit bars full of celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton factories , cotton brokers ' offices . In New Orleans , in the heart of the French quarter , we found an immense room , with an immense electric fan and a wooden balcony overlooking a patio . There were burlesque dancers and young prostitutes wandering about the hotel corridors in bathrobes , and the owner , a fat Russian woman . obstinately decreed that I too was Russian . After a creole dinner we went out to look for some good jazz , but it appeared that there was no longer any Negro jazz in the white quarter . Spring was already over ; the azaleas and the rain were through ; the weather was heavy and dry . We spent the day swimming in Lake Pontchartrain . None of Algren 's photographs had come out . Next came Yucatan , with its jungle , its fields of blue aloes , its red flame trees . I have already described our trip to Chichdn Itza. " , in The Mandarins . Mexico City was a real town where things were happening ; we wandered around in the residential district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we let ourselves be persuaded into attending a show of " native dancing , " actually organized by an old American con man ; it consisted of tourists long past the bloom of youth soulfully applauding as young women in luxurious costumes went through imitaby Simone de Beauvoir 113 tions of peasant dances . We walked out after half an hour and by way of revenge ended up in the sleaziest joint in the entire slum district . For most Americans , Mexico City is a jungle with an assassin working full-time on every street corner . But Algren had been around hundreds of cutthroats in his life without seeing a single throat cut . And in any case , he told me , the incidence of crimes is much lower in Mexico City than it is in New York or Chicago . I had n't yet had the heart to broach the subject of my departure . Every day it became more urgent and more difficult . During a long bus journey between Mexico City and Morelia , I announced to Algren with clumsy flippancy that I would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , all right , " he said . I 'm flabbergasted today when I look back and think how I allowed myself to be fooled by his indifference . At Morelia , I was not surprised that he should n't want to get out and walk around ; I strolled gaily through the streets and squares of the old Spanish town on my own . To Make Something Happen When I began making plans for the next day , Algren stopped me ; he 'd had enough of Indians and markets , of Mexico , and of traveling . I thought it was just a fit of temper and not of any particular consequence . All the same , I began to get uneasy . At the hotel I went on plying him with questions , " What 's the matter ? Everything was going so well ; why are you spoiling everything ? " Far from being moved by my distress , which eventually reduced me to tears , he just walked out on me . When he came back we were reconciled , though without explanations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace of a hotel , surrounded by bougainvilleas and looking out onto a beautiful baroque church . " At the end of two days I 'd be shooting off a revolver in the streets just to make something happen , " Algren said . Mexico was decidedly getting on his nerves . All right . We took a plane to New York . Algren did n't talk to me in quite the same way he used to , and every now and then I even felt a stab of hostility from him . One evening I asked him , " Do n't you care for me as much as you did ? " " No , " he said , " it 's not the same anymore . " I cried all night , leaning out of the window between the silence of the sky and the city 's indifferent noises . We were living in the Brittany at the bottom of Fifth Avenue ; we wandered 114 AN AMERICAN RENDEZVOUS around the Village . We spent painful hours in the French restaurants on the East Side , where I dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the suffocating West Side restaurants which he preferred because they did n't oblige him to wear a jacket and tie . It was my turn to resent him on account of his sullen behavior . One evening , when we had dined in the open-air tavern in Central Park he was particularly disagreeable . " I can leave tomorrow , " I told him . We exchanged a few more words and then suddenly he said to me impulsively , " I 'm ready to marry you this very moment . " I realized I would never be able to harbor rancor in my heart against him for anything ever again ; all the wrongs were on my side . I left him uncertain whether I would ever see him again . If I 'd had the honesty and the intelligence to let Algren know the limits of my stay before going over to see him , things would have worked out better . I have often wondered what part his sudden disappointment actually played in our affair . I think it did nothing more , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accepted for long in any case . Even if Sartre had not existed , I would never have gone to live permanently in Chicago ; or if I had tried to do so , I would certainly not have been able to bear more than one or two years of an exile which would have destroyed both my reasons for writing and the possibility of doing so . Yet our feelings were , for both of us , far from being no more than a diversion or even an escape ; each of us regretted bitterly that the other refused to come and live with him . * * * Every week I found in my mailbox an envelope with a Chicago postmark . While speaking at rallies for Wallace , Algren had fallen in love with a young woman , he wrote ; she was being divorced and he had thought of marrying her. * He explained what he felt in detail . " I wo n't have an affair with this girl , she does n't really mean anything to me . But that does n't change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two or three months ? a place of my own to live in , with a woman of my own and perhaps a child of my own . . . . It 's different for you . You 've got Sartre and a settled way of life , people . and a vital interest in ideas . You live in the heart of the world of French culture , and every day you draw satisfaction from your work and your life . * Algren himself had been married in 1936 and divorced in 1939 ? The Editors . Whereas Chicago is almost as far away from everything as Uxmal . I lead a sterile existence centered exclusively on myself , and I 'm not at all happy about it . I 'm stuck here , as I told you and as you understood , because my job is to write about this city , and I can only do it here . " There was nothing I could say in reply ; he was absolutely right , which did n't make it any easier to bear ; I would always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The happiness of the nights in Chicago and on the Mississippi , and the sudden botched-up ending would have turned it into no more than a dream . Happily , Algren 's letters gradually grew warm again . These Crazy Frenchmen A t the beginning of June 1949 , I put on the white coat I had worn two years ago in Chicago and went to meet Algren 's boat train . He brought me chocolate , whiskey , books , photographs , and a flowered housecoat , As a soldier , he had spent two days in Paris , but had seen almost nothing . It was odd reminding myself as I walked with him , " This is the first time he has ever looked at Paris ; what do they look like to him , these houses , these shops ? " T was anxious ; I did n't want to see that sullen face he had sometimes turned on me in New York . But I soon grew more confident ; his face was always radiant . On foot , in cabs , once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? the streets , the crowds , the markets . French cooking and Beaujolais filled him with delight , even though he preferred sausage to foie gras . He particularly liked shopping in the stores nearby ; the ceremonial exchange of conversation was a delight to him : " Bonjour , monsieur , how are you today , thank you very much , very well and you , fine weather , nasty weather today , au revoir , monsieur , thank you , monsieur . " In Chicago , one shops in silence , he told me . I took him to meet all my friends . With Sartre , conversation was a bit difficult because Sartre does n't know English and I have n't enough patience to be an interpreter , but they got on well . At the Rose Rouge , my friend Bost and Algren swapped infantry reminiscences . Another of my friends , Olga Kosakievicz , seduced Algren utterly by listening to all his stories with eyes wide in astonishment ; he knew hundreds , and when he ran out he made them up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eiffel Tower ? crammed with Americans , and the food and drink were terrible , but the view very beauti116 AN AMERICAN RENDEZVOUS ful ? and he talked for two hours straight about his friends the drug addicts and thieves , till I could no longer tell what was true and what was n't ; Bost did n't believe a word , Olga lapped up everything . We often went for drinks with various people . At first , the " leftists " of our group eyed this American with suspicion . Irritated by this antagonism , he delighted in delivering himself of paradoxes and irrelevant truths . But when they found out that he had voted for Wallace and that his friends were all being forced out of their work in radio and television because of their anti-Americanism , above all when they got to know him better , he was accepted . He met Guyonnet , who was trying to translate his latest novel and having difficulties with all the Chicago slang . Guyonnet invited him one morning to go and box with him and Jean Cau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bouteille d'Or , he collapsed exhausted into his chair . " These Frenchmen , they 're all crazy ! " he said . He had gone up to a sixth-floor room , according to Guyonnet 's instructions , and was greeted by a shout of " Here 's the gallant American ! " He looked out the window and saw Cau and Guyonnet beckoning him to join them on a terrace , to which the only means of access was the glitter up to the roof . For Algren , who suffers from vertigo , it was a terrifying experience . The terrace was about as big as a pocket handkerchief and had no railing ; they boxed on the edge of a precipice . " All mad ! " Algren repeated , still not quite himself . Later that summer Algren wanted to see the Old World , so we took a pleasure trip to Italy , and then to Tunisia and Algeria . It turned out to be quite successful . Back in Paris , the month of September was magnificent . We had never got on better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was certain when I said goodbye to him that I would see Algren again . His first letter was brimming over with high spirits .

New York celebrated his return . A friend had driven him back to Chicago . He was very happy to he home . He wrote : We drove all Saturday and all Sunday , and it was marvelous to see American trees again , and the big American sky , the great rivers and the plains . It is n't as colorful a country as France : it does n't steal your heart like the little red roofs as you come into Paris on the boat train nr when you fly over them in the plane from Marseilles . . . .

" The Second Sex " Creates a Commotion The first volume of The Second Sex had beer published in June of 1949 ; in May , June , and July , Les Temps Modernes had printed chapters from it . In November , Gallimard published the second volume . I have described how this book was conceived . First I considered the myths that men have forged about women through all their cosmologies , religions , superstitions , ideologies , and literatures . I had n't expected to become involved in writing such a vast work . But my study of the myths would be left hanging in midair if people did n't know the reality those myths were intended to mask . I therefore plunged into works of physiology and history . I began to look at women with new eyes and found surprise after surprise lying in wait for me . It is both strange and stimulating to discover suddenly , after the age of forty , an aspect of the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that . somehow you never noticed . One of the misunderstandings created by my book is that people thought T was denying there was any difference between men and women ; on the contrary , writing this book made me even more aware of those things that separate them ; what I contended was that these dissimilarities are of a cultural and not of a natural order . The first volume was well received : twenty-two thousand copies were sold in the first week . The second one also sold well , but it shocked people . I was completely taken aback by the fuss that started when the extracts from the book appeared in Les Temps Modernes . The good old esprit gaulois flowed in torrents . I received ? some signed and some anonymous ? epigrams , epistles , satires , admonitions , and exhortations addressed to me by , for example , " some very active members of the First Sex . " Unsatisfied , frigid , priapic , nymphomaniac , lesbian , a hundred times aborted , I was everything , even an unmarried mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally put on the Index . I had hoped it would be well received by the Extreme Left . Our relations with the Communists could n't have been worse ; all the same , my thesis owed so much to Marxism and showed it in such a favorable light that I did at least expect some impartiality from them ! Marie-Louise Barron , in Les Lettres Francaises , confined herself to remarking that The Second Sex would at least give the factory girls at Billancourt a good laugh ? which implies a very low estimate of the factory girls at Billancourt , replied Colette Audry in a " review of the critics " she did for Combat . Another newspaper , Action , devoted an anonymous and unintelligible article to me , delightfully decorated with the photograph of a woman held fast in the passionate embraces of an ape . My adversaries created and maintained numerous misunderstandings on the subject of my book . Many men declared I had no right to discuss women because I had n't given birth ; and they ? They nevertheless produced some very distinct opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I refused to grant any value to the maternal instinct and to love ; this was not so . I simply asked that women should experience them truthfully and freely , whereas they often use then : as excuses and take refuge in them , only to find themselves imprisoned in that refuge when those emotions have dried up in their hearts . I was said to be preaching sexual promiscuity ; but at no point did I ever advise anyone to sleep with just anyone at just anytime ; my opinion is that all choices , agreements , and refusals should be made independently of institutions , conventions , and motives of self-aggrandizement ; if the reasons for it are not of the same order as the act itself , then the only result can be lies , distortions , and mutilations . I devoted a chapter to the problem of abortion ; Sartre had already written about it in The Aye of Reason , and I myself in The Blood of Others ; people were always rushing into the office of Les Temps Modernes asking the secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day she designed a poster : " We do it on the premises , ourselves . " When all is said and done , The Second Sex is possibly the book that has brought me the greatest satisfaction out of all those I have written . If I am asked what I think of it today , I have no hesitation in replying : I 'm all for it . During these last ten years the myths that men created have crumbled , and many women writers have gone beyond me and dared far more than I dared . Too many of them for my taste take sexuality as their only theme ; but at least whenby Simone de Beauvoir 119 they write about it they now present themselves as the eye that looks , as the subject , the conscious free being . A New Resistance ? At the time of the Korean War , there was a good deal of talk about a Russian occupation of Europe . MacArthur wanted to bomb China ; in that ease the Russians would intervene . In America , I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of identifying victims after an atomic attack . If war were to break out , the Red Army would invade Europe as far as Brest in next to no time ; what then ? " The day the Russians march into Paris , " said Francine Camus , " I shall kill myself and my two children . " In one lyee.e some teenagers , terrified by their parents ' prophecies , made a collective suicide pact that would be effective in the event of a Russian occupation . It did n't occur to me to wonder what I should do until the conversation we had with Camus at the Balzar . " Have you thought about what will happen to you when the Russians get here ? " he asked Sartre ; and then added with a great deal of emotion , " You must n't stay ! " " And do you expect to leave ? " asked Sartre . " Oh , I 'll do what I did during the German occupation . " Sartre 's only objection was that he would never accept having to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proletariat become a mystique , " Camus answered sharply ; and he complained of the French workers ' indifference to the Soviet labor camps . " They 've got trouble enough without worrying about what 's going on in Siberia , " was Sartre 's reply . " All right , " said Camus , " hut all the same , they have n't exactly earned the Legion of Honor ! " Strange words ? Camus , like Sartre , had refused the Legion of Honor , which their friends in power had wanted to give them in 1945 . We felt a great distance between us . Yet it was with real warmth that he urged Sartre , " You must leave . If you stay it wo n't he only your life they 'll take , but your honor as well . They 'll cart you off to a camp and you 'll die . Then they 'll say you 're still alive , and they 'll use your name to preach resignation and submission and treason , and people will believe them . " I was shaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camus ' arguments and used them myself . Sartre listened to me with a mulish look on his face ; he rejected the idea of exile to the very marrow of his bones . Algren , now convinced that some headstrong action on the part of MacArthur might unleash a world war at any moment , invited us both to his summer place near Chicago . But we had never detested America more violently than we did at that moment . Sartre was convinced that by going into exile , no matter how good the reasons far doing so , one lost one 's place in the world , and that one could never quite recover it again . And we were considering flight from a regime which was , in spite of everything , the embodiment of socialism ! Sartre was unable either to elude or to accept the now-manifest fact that the Communists , by treating him as an enemy , were forcing him to act as though he actually were one . He never put much faith in the likelihood of a Russian occupation ; but envisaging it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of our situation ; the shock it inflicted on him played a great role in his subsequent development . * The last time I saw Camus , he made fun of a lot of the criticisms of his book The Rebel ? he just took it for granted that we liked it , and Sartre had great difficulty in knowing what to say to him . A little later , Sartre warned him that the review in Les Temps Modernes would be fairly cool . if not harsh . Camus seemed disagreeably surprised . Francis Ranson had accepted the task of reviewing the book and had promised to do it circumspectly ; but , as it turned out , he got carried away . Sartre persuaded him to soften some of his strictures , but there was no censorship on the magazine . Camus , affecting to ignore Jeanson 's existence , sent Sartre an open letter in which he addressed him as " Monsieur is direeteur . " Sartre replied in the next issue . And everything was over between them .  --  As a matter of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time not much of it had remained . The political and ideological differences which already existed between Sartre and Camus in 1945 had intensified from year to year . Camas was an idealist , a moralist , and an anti-Communist . Sartre had labored since /940 to repudiate idealism , to wrench himself away from his original individualism , to live in history ; his position was close to Marxism , and at this time he desired an alliance with the Communists . These differences of opinion were too radical for the friendship between the two men not to be shaken . * * * Circumstances had convinced Sartre that the only path still open to the Left was to find a way back to unity of action with the Communist party . And the contradiction that was tearing him apart had by then become intolerable . In some unpublished notes , he wrote : " I was a victim of and an accomplice in the class struggle : a victim because 1 was hated by an entire class ; an 122 AN AMERICAN RENDEZVOUS accomplice because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class struggle in that slow dismemberment that tore us away from them the workers more and more each day . . . . " Sartre told me one clay , " I 've always thought against myself . " But he had never done so as savagely as he did in the years from 1950 to 1952 . The work he had begun in 1945 with his article on the writer 's commitment was finished ; he had utterly demolished all his illusions about the possibility of personal salvation . He was ready to accept a collective discipline without denying his own liberty . " After ten years of rumination , I had reached breaking point ; one light tap was all that was required . " It was a book that struck him first ? Le Coup du 2 Decembre by Guillemin . All capitalists must speak with the voice of capital ; yet the bourgeoisie are nonetheless individuals of flesh and blood who , to defend their interests , employ means whose violence is scarcely masked . It was Guillemin who tore away the veils hiding this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the principles it had inculcated in me . . I swore a hatred for the bourgeoisie that would die only with my own death . When I returned abruptly to Paris , I had to write or choke . " He wrote the first part of Les Communistes et la Paix with a fury that frightened me . " In two weeks , he 's spent five nights without sleep and the other nights he only sleeps four or five hours , " I wrote my sister . The article appeared in Les Temps Modernes a month before his Reponse d Camus . These two pieces of writing bad the same meaning ? the postwar period was over . No more postponements , no more conciliations were possible . We had been forced into making clear-cut choices . " I had to accept the point of view of the U.S.S.R. in its totality , " he noted , " and count on myself alone to maintain my own . Finally , I was alone because I did not wish to be alone enough . " This epoch we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoke in The Mandarins . Why Not ? Sartre and M. were not getting on well anymore . Despite his opposition she had come to live in Paris . They quarreled and eventually separated . Algren and I spent the late summer of 1950 together at his summer place and he had told me then that he did n't love me anymore . The following year , we wrote to each other only rarely , and even then had little to say . In one letter , though , he suggested I spend the coining October with him . He was offering , in all honesty , the friendship that it is always so easy to maintain when a rupture has been made without bitterness and the two people concerned are living in the same city . I consulted Sartre . " Why not ? " he said . I accepted . Plane , train , taxi- ? I was quite calm when I arrived ; I had nothing to gain and nothing to lose .

As I walked along the beach during the last days of October 1951 , between the dunes dusted with gold and the changing blue of the water , I thought to myself that I would never see him again , nor the house , nor the lake , nor the sand being pecked at by little white waders . The last morning , the hours seemed to drag for both of us ; we refused to talk to each other and we were embarrassed by our silence . At last I said that I had had a very nice time there and that at least we still had a real friendship for each other . " It 's not friendship , " he replied brutally . " I can never offer you less than love .

I got back to Paris on the Jour des Marts ; everywhere there were chrysanthemums and people wearing black . And I knew the answer to my question . " One can still have the same feelings for someone , " Algren wrote to me , " and still not allow them to rule and disturb one 's life .
