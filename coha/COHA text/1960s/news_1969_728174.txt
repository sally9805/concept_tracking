The six , who apparently decided to make their break for Cuba because of joblessness , marriage problems and a disaffection with life in America , were reported to have had achange of heart about life in Cuba . A few months ago several of them began inquiring with diplomats in Havana and by letter with friends in the United States about the chances of returning to this country . " They seemed pretty happy about returning , " a United States Immigration guard said at the Canadian border where the six crossed into the United States at 2:15 A.M. after arriving in Montreal on a Cuban freighter .
