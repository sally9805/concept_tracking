Next week , if all goes well , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will launch Mariner 5 , a $30 million spacecraft designed to shoot past Venus at a distance of only 2,000 miles and probe the mysteries of the cloud-shrouded planet during its flyby . Whatever its findings , however , Mariner will hardly be able to top the recent accomplishment of astronomers in a plane flying only 37,000 feet above the earth . Using an ingenious scheme and sophisticated equipment , they determined conclusively that Venus is a bone-dry planet devoid of water-and probably devoid of any kind of life . <P> Even after Mariner 2 determined in 1962 that the surface temperature of Venus was about 800 F. , some scientists expressed the hope that life might exist on its cooler mountaintops or among the water clouds and ice crystals believed to exist in the Venusian atmosphere . But the yellow hue of Venusian clouds has long caused University of Arizona Astronomer Gerard Kuiper , 61 , to doubt that they were composed of water in any form . <P> Split Image . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a twelve-inch telescope and some complex infra-red instruments into a NASA Convair 990 jet last month and flew along a computer-determined course between Montreal and Lake Superior . At its 37,000-foot altitude , the plane was above 99.5% of the earth 's atmospheric water vapor , which ordinarily confuses ground-based astronomers attempting to determine the amount of water on other planets . <P> By keeping a **25;5437;TOOLONG mirror pointed directly at Venus through a port in the plane 's roof the scientists were able to deflect the planet 's reflected light continuously for more than an hour into the telescope , which was mounted horizontally inside the plane . During this time , they obtained 2,000 separate patterns of Venusian light on an interferometer-a device that splits a beam of light , sends each half along a path of different length , and then rejoins them in an interference pattern of light and dark fringes . Computer analysis and averaging of these patterns by scientists at Block Associates in Cambridge , Mass. , produced two of the clearest spectrograms ever obtained of Venus at high altitude . Although the spectrograms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venusian atmosphere , they did reveal what appeared to be a significant trace of water vapor . But Kuiper and his associates were not deceived . <P> Desolate Planet . To cancel out the effects of any water vapor in the portion of the earth 's atmosphere still above them , the airborne astronomers had also taken about 1,000 interferograms of the moon , which was close to Venus in the sky during the flight . Although the moon is known to be dry , the lunar spectrograms produced by the Block computers also showed evidence of a trace of water vapor . The vapor , the scientists knew , had been detected not on the moon but in the earth 's atmosphere . Thus , by eliminating the same proportion of terrestrial vapor from the Venus spectrograms , they were able to determine the true amount of Venusian water vapor-approximately one-half of one-billionth of the Venusian atmosphere , compared with a vapor content of 1/400th of the atmosphere on earth .                    @
