The Jazz Age belle who once danced on tabletops and came home to die in a terrible fire has not been forgotten by her onetime schoolmates , beaux , and rivals in Montgomery , Alabama . Their genteel , devious , and sometimes malicious recollections evoke the portrait of a dazzling young woman who was very much the creature of the Southern life-style on which she tried to turn her back . Ihave been to Montgomery . Alabama , only twice , both times for short visits , to talk about Zelda Sayre who was born and raised there at the turn of the century . She is known there as Zelda Sayre and never as Mrs. F. Scott Fitzgerald , for to those who knew her in her younger days it was Scott who ruined her , who single-handedly destroyed their lovely and flawless girl . And although it was not she Scott had in mind when he wrote The Last of the Belles. " that is how she is remembered in the Deep South . It is by preference that they remember her in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 , a woman nearly forty , changed physically beyond recognition . It was no easier for her that her friends refused to admit the profound alteration they found in her . To this day they disregard her mental illness as if it were a facial tic , something one is uneasy about . She is their kittenish belle in a leghorn hat with streamers down her back , who danced on table tops at the University of Alabama , and Auburn and Georgia Tech . I flew to Montgomery on May 30 of 1968 for the fiftieth reunion of Zelda Sayre 's high-school ) graduating class . I planned to listen to her classmates ' reminiscences , to learn what I could of her girlhood , for she had always run against the stream rather than with it , and to recapture , if I could , " Montgomery as it was . " Scott Fitzgerald put it that way in his Notebooks under " Nostalgia or The Flight of the Heart . " Most of the people I would talk with are now in their sixties and seventies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left of the old South and its traditions . To communicate with them about one of their own is not easy . Appearance counts , and so does your name . There was not a woman there whom I met who did not use at least three names , Christian , maiden , and married . They know who you come from and where you 've gone . One old woman told me that another biographer of the Fitzgeralds had simply missed the point about Zelda 's background . " Of course the Sayres did n't have much money in those days , none of us did . But , my dear , Judge Sayre Zelda 's father was from Macon County , and that meant he was a Whig . To be a Whig was to be an aristocrat . " After my plane from New York landed in Montgomery I drove from the airport toward the city on U. S. Route 80 which , like all the cement highways that crisscross the South , looks new and clean and freshly poured , past fields of black-eyed Susans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The color of the earth is rusty , or redder than that , like dried paint , and it was very hot with waves of heat shuddering up from the highway . The land is rich and the fields have a gentle roll bordered by clusters of trees with their heavy , beautiful Spanish moss . The landscape is incredibly clear , like a cutout . The inscription on the red and white license plates says , " Heart of Dixie , " and on the lower left corner is a large heart . After several miles of farmland , Route 80 becomes Fairview Avenue and then the tremendous new growth of Montgomery is apparent . New gas stations and motels and drive-ins line the road ; Fairview becomes South Perry Street which leads me past Zelda 's sister 's house down directly into the center of town . I descend into Montgomery from a hill , and ahead of me , just beyond the city , is the Alabama River , curled once like a flat brown ribbon . The center of town is hot and treeless . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatten everything . The stores are run-down ; there is almost nobody on the streets . The buildings are one- , two- , and three-story bricks of the last century with modernization stuck on theirfronts : plate-glass windows displaying chunky inexpensive furniture , painted signs blistering on the sides of buildings , dusty neon signs with the current off looking dead . The population of Montgomery has quadrupled since Zelda 's birth when it was about 35,000 , and doubled since the second world war . But the growth of Montgomery , as elsewhere , has been to the suburbs , withering the center of town . The Capitol at the top of Dexter Avenue is a reminder of the pastoral beauty Montgomery must once have possessed . Dexter Avenue , when Zelda was a girl , was a wide boulevard with shade trees along either side leading up to the white Capitol . The trees were all cut down one night without warning to the public , who awoke , as one lady would tell me , to find " Dexter stripped clean as a whistle . " Metal parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its high dome and black filigreed iron balcony , is a splendid building . Jefferson Davis took the oath of office to the Confederacy from the steps of its colonnaded portico . It is flanked by trees and sits at the top of several tiers of whitish marble steps . It has a classical Georgian grandeur and its very whiteness is striking ; it shimmers in the heat like a mirage of cake at a banquet . Both the Confederate and the State of Alabama flags fly from its dome , but not the American flag . In April 1963 George Wallace ordered the Confederate flag to be flown in the face of Robert Kennedy 's showdown with him on integration . Since then the Capitol has been designated a historical monument ; the Confederate flag remains in place . T remember the early morning of March 26 , 1965 . It is my birthday ; the telephone is ringing and I 'm packing to go to Montgomery . The voice from Montgomery is breathless . I am told not to come : Mrs. Liuzzo has been murdered . The Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are fornicating with nuns on the steps of our Capitol . They are defecating on the steps of the Capitol . I do n't believe they are our nigras . I do n't believe it . " Perhaps the ugliness of the center of town is exaggerated because of the prettiness of the houses that edge it . Coming down Perry Street last May I noticed great gum and cedar trees arching over the streets , and lush green gardens by old houses . Most of the houses look like storybook illustrations , two- and three-story Victorians of white frame and stucco or reptilian stone with generous porches and wide bay windows , capped with pointed cupolas of tin like dunce caps . 48 THE GOLDEN DREAMS OF ZELDA FITZGERALD I checked into the Whitley Hotel and asked if there were any messages ; there were n't . I knew there was a banquet scheduled for tonight and that I was not invited to it . A member of Zelda 's class whom 1 knew had explained to me that some of the forty-odd people who have come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they wanted a time alone together . This was their reunion and not Zelda 's . I was invited to join them on Friday for a bus trip around Montgomery , to see the old and the new in the city , and to a luncheon afterwards . In my room were three red roses with a card welcoming me to " the cradle of the Confederacy . " They were from Paul , who knew Zelda at the end of her life in 1947 when she was living in a tiny cottage called " Rabbit Run " on Sayre Street with her mother , and he was a student in creative writing at the University of Alabama . Paul had met Zelda for the first time when he was in high school in 1941 . He was a friend of Livye Hart Ridgeway 's son , and Livye Hart and Zelda had been friends since girlhood . In his freshman year at the University of Alabama his roommate was crazy about F. Scott Fitzgerald and was trying , according to Paul , to run himself out as Fitzgerald had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed him for details . A little embarrassed that he could remember none , Paul decided he would call her the next weekend he was in Montgomery . " She was so kind to me always . First time I called she said , Of course 1 remember you , ' and she asked me to come by to visit for tea , I think . " It was the beginning of many visits and discussions and letters about writing that lasted until her death in 1948 . " I had the feeling she did n't see many people anymore , and she made me feel she wanted to see me and talk to me . She did n't talk down to me at all . If anything I had a hard time following her , keeping up with her , I mean , she was brilliant . I 've never heard a voice like hers before , not soft , but sort of husky , musical maybe , but with an edge to it . " Zelda wrote to him about the stories he left with her , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoking . Ile read her letters three or four times , he said , before he understood what she meant . " She would talk about the past : her reveries were always in the past and her mind often turned to Paris , which she loved . Then she would talk about Scott and Hemingway . But she spoke very little about herself . She told one story on herself that I can remember . At a Sigma Nu dance at the University of Alabama small glassbaby bottles were given as favors . She said she and her date filled theirs with straight gin and had more fun than anyone there . " Paul began to grin . " And there is one I remember that everybody knows who ever went to the University of Alabama . Zelda was asked to take the leadoff of the Black and White Ball that the SAEs give at Christmastime and something about it must have irritated her . Anyway it was the formal ball of the year at Alabama ; the men wore tails and probably still do and the girls came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballroom in a flaming red gown with a sprig of mistletoe pinned to her rear . There is n't a boy at Alabama to this day who does n't know that story . She 's a legend ; there was nobody like her . " To the left of the couch where I was sitting was a painting Zelda had given Paul just before her death . It is a painting of the Champs-Elysees with the Arc de Triomphe in the background , and a very cheery-looking automobile , fenders almost off , bouncing down the road with a dog and a couple of bright flowers . It is now badly faded ; Paul explained that the man who framed it for him in New Orleans said Zelda must have painted with anything on anything and cut her paints with mineral water . Zelda was killed in a fire that gutted the top floor of the building at Highland Hospital in Asheville where she was recuperating from insulin treatments . After her death , Paul said , he had written a letter in his grief to the Saturday Review saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their readers would care to share with him . He received several letters , but none from people who had even met Zelda . He brought them out to the sofa from his bureau , a small packet of envelopes , and carefully read each of them to me . One was from a strange man who wanted to know how Paul could possibly have known Zelda if she had died in a mental institution unless he was in one too . Another was curiously touching . It came from a girl living in New York City by herself in a women 's residence hotel . She was taking night courses at Columbia , she said , and 2'ender is the Night held special meaning for her . She wondered how much of it was autobiographical . She Nancy Milford has spent much of the past four years working on a biography of Zelda Fitzgerald which she began as a Master 's essay at Cambia University . She has two children and is teaching freshman composition at Columbia . She traveled to Montgomery last year for a fresh assessment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelda 's life , her style , and she guessed that Zelda 's elan had so marked Scott 's life that it came through in his writing . She thought Zelda was probably fearless toward life , whereas she was afflicted by fear . She wanted to know if Paul would write to her , and he did . But she never wrote again . An old Kodak snapshot of Zelda fell from among the letters . She looks about sixteen and she is wearing a swimming suit sitting beside a pool . Her hair is long , still wet and sticking to her face . She is leaning backwards on her elbows , both feet up in the air , and she is laughing merrily out from between her legs . Clearly she is not the least hit concerned about showing her backside to the camera , for it is prominent in the photograph . Friday morning I was picked up shortly after nine o'clock to be driven to the bus that would take the Class of 1918 around Montgomery . Milo Howard , Jr. , the curator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to give " the spiel , " as he called it , during the ride , and squire me about during the morning and afternoon . But beforehand he offered to drive me wherever I 'd like to go in the forty-five minutes we had before the trip . Howard is the nephew of Genie Blue Howard . a member of the Class of 1918 , who was voted the Most Popular " girl of their class . Zelda was the " Prettiest " and the " Most Attractive . " I wanted to see the old Confederate cemetery where Zelda had walked " to feel , " as she put it to Scott when they were courting , " the death of William Wreford , 1864 . . . in a hundred years think I shall like having young people speculate on whether my eyes were brown or blue ? of course sic , they are neither ? I hope my grave has an air of many , many years ago about it ? Is n't it funny how , out of a row of Confederate soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dead loves ? when they 're exactly like the others , even to the yellowish moss ? Old death is so beautiful ? so very beautiful ? We will die together ? I know ? " We drove into the cemetery up through twin lines of poplars to the Sayres ' plot . We walked among extravagant gray angels with chipped wings , and broken columns , and those shiny pointed phalluses of white marble that mark the most distinguished graves ; we walked through old iron fences with little rickety gates that creaked open , past blue weeds and pieces of glass , and we saw the rain-streaked Confederate flags and the fresher ones , stuck crossed in pairs in front of the tombstones , like gay banners of pride . Zelda 's grave was not there , of course , because she is buried next to Scott in Maryland , but we found many Sayres and Goldthwaites and Scotts and Codys , but no William Wreford . When we got to the bus most of the classmates of 1918 were already there . On the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Class of 1918 . " A lady who was the daughter of someone there stood taking movies of the people who were gathered in front of the bus , squinting in the bright light . No one moved and then the lady said , " This is a movie . Y'all got ta move ! " So they waved a little self-consciously and one of the old men dropped down on his left knee abruptly with his right fist stuck in the ground in front of him like a runner and grinned , but his wife plucked at his sleeve and said , " Oh , honey , " and he got back up and stood woodenly with the others . There were about forty people and of them only three spoke to me . About the heat : it was 93 ? . About my age : I was young to be writing a book about Zelda . About Montgomery : it sure had changed . Whether they were shy of me or suspicious I could not know . Certainly , I did not then realize that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ride lasted nearly two hours . I sat by myself at the back of the bus . We passed through new suburban housing developments named McGee Estates and Gay Meadow , and they all looked like Hollywood sets with imitation antebellum brick houses , fake Tudors , and one lonely-looking shingled saltbox . In the older residential part of town , called " The Hill " , where Zelda had always lived , the old houses had begun to rot and fall apart . The white frame Victorian at 6 Pleasant Avenue with its brick front porch and potted plants where Zelda lived while she was going to high school had been torn down to make way for a highway . We stopped only once , at the old Sidney Lanier High School , which is now called Baldwin High . It is a yellow brick four-story building , and the two naked statues of the goddesses of wisdom and justice upon which the boys of Zelda 's class used to drape " certain articles of female attire " have long since been removed . As we walked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that even in 1918 the auditorium had been too small to hold their Commencement exercises . It was at the Grand Theater at eight o'clock , Friday evening of May 31 , 1918 , that 59 seniors ( 45 girls and 14 boys ) from the Sidney Lanier High School received 50 THE GOLDEN DREAMS OF ZELDA FITZGERALD their diplomas from Lieutenant Lister J. Hill . But Zelda was not among them on the stage . No one any longer remembers why she was not with the rest of them . But the president of their class , Irby Jones , remembers her sitting in the audience in a beautiful white silk dress with a tunic of chiffon over it . He said she told him afterwards , " Why , Irby , I just came to hear you speak . " And he wondered then , as he wonders now , whether she was teasing him or making fun of all of them . The day before Commencement was Class Day and a class prophecy was read along with a class history , and a " crazy poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said of Zelda tongue- i n - cheek : The girls ' quartet sang " My Lady Chloe , " and a. boys ' quartet sang " Honey Child , " then the entire class joined in while Theodosia Burr Lee played " Of Beer Rabbit " on the piano . Even when Zelda was seventeen this kind of thing could not have been her scene . She had stood in the wings of the auditorium with her stockings rolled to her knees , which was a racy thing to do in 1918 , and she was asked to roll her stockings back up and she would n't . Jesse Traywick was standing with the principal of their high school watching Zelda because , as he says , " She sure was a pretty little thing to watch , " and the older man turned to him and said that for the first time in his life he wished he were younger . After visiting the school we got back on the bus to drive to the luncheon . Colonel Jesse Tray-wick sat next to me ; we began to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " You know how girls that age are , they date the older boys . " A man across the aisle leaned forward and said , " Jesse , Zelda dated them all , all ages . " They both laughed . " By the time we were graduating the soldier boys were in town , " Colonel Traywick said . " Why old Montgomery just spun with soldiers coming in from Camp Sheridan . I worked at May 's Drugstore , jerking sodas , you might say , and there were dances held in a big room above the store . But I could never afford to go . There was this dollar cover , and then the man was expected to bring his flask . But I 'll tell you , Zelda was there . Zelda was there in glory . " The two men began to talk about the time Zelda had ridden down Dexter Avenue in a one-piece flesh-colored knit bathing suit with herlegs draped barefooted out over the hack of the rumble seat . A group of boys who were called Jelly Beans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . They hollered at her , and seeing them , she stood up in the car , laughing , and stretched out her arms wide and said , " All my Jellies ! " One of the men said , " You see , you got to remember , to us , Zelda was a . . a kingmaker . " The luncheon was a garden party , buffet-style with Southern fried chicken , sliced ham , salads , tomatoes , iced tea , and Southern women in pale dresses . There were four tables with white tablecloths set up on the lawn , and cut-glass bowls filled with gardenias . Balancing my plate I came up behind the president of the class who happened to be telling the nine other people at his table , " Now I think we just are n't going to talk about Zelda at the end of her life . We are going to protect ... " With several stricken faces looking at him he realized that I was there . He turned to me , smiling hugely , and asked me to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat of his hand , " Draw up a chair for this little girl . . . " But by then I was maneuvered to another table . Why , they all wanted to know , was someone my age interested in Zelda ? " Of course , " one woman said , " every idea Scott ever had came from Zelda . We all knew that . " Someone interrupted her , " Now that 's not fair , Cousie , I think Zelda may have helped , but she did n't write them . " " I did n't say she did , did I ? T said they came from her , they were her ideas . " A man at the far end of the table said , " Zelda was brilliant . If she ever once tried to do something in school she was a crackerjack at it . I remember she 'd come into class without her theme written and ask me what it was supposed to be about , and by the time class was up she 'd have written hers . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A woman said , " Mrs. Sayre wrote those for her and you know it , " " I know no such thing for sure . " How well , I asked , was she really liked , especially by the girls ? The woman next to me said , " Honey , we all loved Zelda Sayre ! We surely did . " Why were n't there any snapshots of her in their yearbooks ? And why had n't she belonged to their clubs , like The Dirty Five , The Babytots , or The Yama-Yama Girls ? The lady said , maybe Zelda was n't the clubby type . A woman in a bright orange dress with a black straw matador 's hat perched rakishly on her red curls came over to me and said , " Zelda Sayre knew how to have a good time , do n't you think ? " I said yes she knew how to have a good time , but that the good times had not lasted very long . She said , " Well , she had it for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little uncertainly back to her seat . She called back to me , " Good times do n't last ! " The man at the far end of my table who began to look more and inure like Eisenhower was smiling and began insisting that Gainesville , Georgia , produced four to five million chickens a day . " Yes , ma'am , live chickens , a dry ! " The woman on my right said , " You listen to him , he ought to know . You ever heard of Jewell chickens ? Well , that 's Jewell ! " Tie kept smiling , and then he said , " Zelda danced on the tops of tables at Auburn . On the tops ! Of course I remember Zelda . What man would n't remember a pretty girl on the top of a table at Auburn ! But I did n't take Zelda out . We had a lot of competition in those days from the soldiers . " A woman interrupted him , " I do n't suppose any nice girl dated Yankee soldiers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she danced on the tops of tables at Auburn besides . " When we finished eating , the hostess stood up . She pointed to a black woman who had served us and said , " This is Emma , and she 's been with us for twenty-eight years , and I 'd rather let her go than my husband . " She corrected herself , " I mean I 'd rather let him go than her . " Everyone laughed comfortably . Then she said she wanted " to introduce a stranger in our midst . " But she could not remember my name . Finally she asked me to stand up and introduce myself . " Now we are going to talk about Zelda Sayre , " she said . There was an awkward pause until Mrs. Anne Paul Goldthwaite Durr rose , and walking forward for emphasis , told about Commencement . " We had decided to spend five dollars on our dresses and they hail to measure no more than ten inches from the floor . Now Zelda used to conic to school , you all remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hand-me-downs from her sisters . But you should have seen the dress she showed up in ! My , but it was lovely , silk and chiffon , but it most surely did not cost but five dollars ! Then she had rolled her stockings and I remember our principal telling her to roll them back up then and there , and she did . That was Zelda . " In the general laughter , I caught the eye of Traywick ; he winked at me . Mary Elmore Persons , half-standing and half-sitting , said : " Now I do n't want to say anything out of turn , but the Sayres should have paid more attention to Zelda . She got no disciplining at home the way the rest of us did . " Irby Jones interrupted her and began to tell about playing hooky on April Fool 's Day . " I do n't want to say that Zelda was the ringleader , but she surely did not hold back at all . " Again everyone laughed . " Was n't it Zelda persuaded the ticket taker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free ? " he asked . Mrs. Durr answered him , " We collected less than ninety cents among us and Zelda persuaded him to let us all in for that . " Irby Jones said , " That was Zelda . " The Reverend Frank Moseley came up to my chair during this speak-out . " You know what T. remember best about Scott ? I can never forget the first time I met Scott . He made an impression that lasted a lifetime . We were all on the train between Montgomery and Auburn , I believe . It was late May and you know how hot it is then . Why , coming toward me , down the aisle , was this handsome man wearing a derby , spats , and carrying a walking cane ! I had never seen anyone dressed like that in my life , and except for Scott , I still have n't . " It seemed for a moment that we were all receding into another time . Stories about Zelda exploded into conversation , but in all of them there seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insinuations about what Scott had called her " sexual recklessness , " but only the lightest touch of it . Someone began to describe swimming in the nude , but a woman interrupted to say that she was there , and Zelda was not in the nude . She had on that one-piece flesh-colored swimming suit . Or was it white ? In one story it would he silk , in another knit , in another she was sitting on a block of ice with it on , sliding down Dexter Avenue on the hottest day of the summer when everyone was bound to be out on their porches . Nothing was suggested about that side of her which wrote about William Wreford . And I realized for what must have been the hundredth time in my life the occupational hazards in being a biographer , especially of someone who is legendary , but perhaps of anyone , and it is that the stories get enlarged , or changed , or even made-up over the years until no one knows the difference , until they are believed , and believed deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference to anyone whether the stories are real or not . Zelda liked to be the center of attention , and she worked toward it as if possession were a gift . Men liked her , women did n't . None of her contemporaries talked about her own writing ; no one had read Save Me the Waltz , which was published in 1932 by Scribner 's , and which had been reissued in the summer of 1967 . One of her old classmates called her painting " peculiar , like Picasso . " Zelda existed for them as the girl they had read about more surely than as the girl they had known , if 62 THE GOLDEN DREAMS OF ZELDA FITZGERALD they had known her . and they held to that knowledge with tenacity , as if by preference . They dissembled because among themselves they had decided to " protect " her ; some perhaps because they resented her , but some dissembled because it had become a habit of mind with them and they could no longer tell the difference , even to themselves , about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hotel I began to make arrangements for my interviews the next day , but now T could feel the wariness even on the telephone . Mrs. Gannon had n't the time , Mrs. Garland felt she had nothing to offer , Mrs. Mercer could n't see me , Leon Ruth was dead . Amelia Harper Rosenberg , who taught dancing for years in Montgomery , knew Zelda well , especially on her return to Montgomery in 1931 from her breakdown in Switzerland and her final trip home in 1940 . " I gave Zelda a key to my studio and she came and danced whenever she felt like it , almost every day . She took two private lessons a day during the period Scott was in Hollywood . " That was in 1931 . " Scottie. their daughter , had a Frenchwoman for a governess , and Mademoiselle would come and play the piano for Zelda . Zelda 's technique was good , very good indeed , but something was not there ; her elevation was n't that good . She did n't have whatever it is that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come every day that she was able . She took classes for a while with my fourteen- , fifteen- , and sixteen-year-olds . Some of their mothers called me and did n't like it at all . I said if you do n't like it you are free to withdraw your pupils . " Mrs. Rosenberg was the first of three women to admit that Zelda was lonely during her last years in Montgomery . The usual reply to my question was . " Why Zelda was with her friends . She had come home , How could she be lonely ? " Mrs. Rosenberg snorted at this . " Of course she was lonely . She saw very few people . I remember that she was happiest , almost meek , when I would give her difficult combinations of ballet steps to do . She would become very serious then . You could see that she loved it . She said dancing was her one salvation . " Painting was another salvation . The Museum of Fine Arts has three of Zelda 's paintings and I went to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they all hang in storage . All of the paintings are done in oil and are flaking badly . One is of two ballet dancers in front of a curtain , perhaps on a stage . Both of these figures are apparently female with long blonde , almost colorless. hair . and both are nude . They hold out fromtheir bodies a ruffled garment , perhaps their discarded costumes , but they are held as if they were capes . They look like pancreases . The colors are chalky and muted . The figures all heavily muscled with enlarged feet and legs ; their heads bend downwards , and the one facing forward is featureless . The other 's head is averted from view . The more interesting painting is of a circus pair . In this the figures are in motion , but they look suspended , as if floating within the context of the circus . There are two tiny white circus horses with plumes in their manes . The colors are muted pinks , grays , and lavender . The figures are distorted , their hands open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeterminate . Their lips are very red , their faces marked by only the slightest indication of feature , a line to indicate where the eyes would be , and they are both hairless . The final painting which Zelda called " Hope " is made up of about twenty or thirty circular shapes like cotton balls . Perhaps they are blossoms , for there are a few very slight touches of green on what might be stems . The painting is vague and watery ? very pale , blue and white and gray . It is the most innocuous of her paintings , the one that is most frequently hung in Montgomery . " Well , of course , " the lady who took me to see them said , " a lot of people in Montgomery think Zelda was a little bit ahead of her time . " She laughed . " They figure that if a picture of a person does n't look like a person it 's modern art . " The next day in Montgomery I talked separately with two women who insisted I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crucified . " one of them said . Both of them saw a good deal of Zelda from 1940 to 1947 and they remembered her walking the streets of Montgomery in high white stockings , like knee socks , wearing a funny little Alpine hat , bicycling even in the heat . " Of course at first she was invited to parties . I remember one she came to . Everyone was standing in the garden with drinks in their hands and when Zelda saw them she dropped to her knees in prayer . You can imagine how that ripped Montgomery . " Her skirts were too long and her hair was n't right and she could n't carry it off any longer , so she retired more and more into the world of her mother and her painting . The lady said , " I always left my door open to her and there were plenty of books in the library and a light wine on the table . One day I came home and walked into the library and sat down by myself . All of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her . I said , ' Zelda why did n't you make a noise ? ' And she said , ' This is the only place where I can sit by myself and take a drink and read . ' " The other woman talked about the last time she saw Zelda : " We went to a little tavern on the outskirts of Montgomery . She was never allowed to go anywhere alone . So we just sat there for some time talking about when we were young together , sipping a light wine , when someone must have called Mittelle Noble . " ( He was Zelda 's niece 's husband ; Zelda was close to them both . ) " Mittelle was not the kind of man to lose his temper or to show it , but he came in and got Zelda and took her home with him . She was so embarrassed ; she tried to tell him that we were just passing time , but then she stopped trying and left with him quietly . You see , she could n't do or go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , I took a walk over the octagonal blue and white cement sidewalks in the old part of town , the part of Montgomery that Zelda describes in her fiction . I went by the Sayre Street school where Zelda had gone to elementary school , one of those cheerless buildings with a red sandy playground behind it . Close by was a magnolia tree ; it must have been at least three stories high . I took a blossom from it , because I had never seen a magnolia up close , nor smelled its fragrance . The blossom is the size of a man 's hand with eight thick white petals set in a cluster of flat , deep-green leaves . The smell of the blossom is as potent as musk : heavily sweet and too rich . It is unforgettable . I remember a story Gerald Murphy had told me years ago about Zelda . They were sitting together in the garden of the Villa America at Antibes , and he had asked her about her youth in the South , for she never talked about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a brilliant fuchsia peony . She said that when she was a girl her beaux would leave her a single petal of the magnolia with a message pricked upon it with a pin , and within an hour after it had been picked , the part that was marked turned brown . In the late spring of 1940 , only a few weeks after Zelda had returned home to Montgomery for the last time she wrote to Scott , " . it 's been a long time since I lived here and most of my friends are long since swallowed up ... a lone and middle-aged woman is a far pleasanter spectacle when merged in her traditions . To a man , I suppose the pressure of life is always supposed to be paramount but to a woman the poignancy of personal desirability is almost inescapably paramount . " It makes me sad to lose forever , in the recapturing , the scenes of my youth . " What must it have been like to return here disfigured by years of fighting against schizophrenia , after having left Montgomery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia , " Scott said . Painting in other people 's gardens ; bicycling or walking five miles a day because that was doctor 's orders , but no one knew that in Montgomery ; praying because there was very little else to do when you had exhausted everything else . After leaving my last interview I saw some boys and a one-armed man playing ball . After we were introduced , the man said , " My mother knew Zelda Sayre ; she knew all the Sayres because they lived close by to her . " He asked me if I wanted to come into his house because he had a painting of Zelda 's . I walked into the new ranch house , and on the wall to the left of the entrance was a painting of red flowers , unmistakably Zelda 's . The organic-looking red blossoms , swollen and twisted , jagged in their pot , hung in a central position on the wall . " It sure is a pretty picture , " his wife said as she came from the kitchen . " 1 think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Hey , tell her what you used to call Zelda , honey . " " She would n't be interested in that , I was a kid then . " " No , go on and tell her what you used to call her , honey . " " Well , " he said , " I used to ? we all did ? call her that crazy woman . We 'd say , there goes that crazy woman . " He paused . " You know she was crazy . " You see she used to ride a bicycle around town and nobody her age did that in Montgomery , so we just used to always call her that crazy woman . " He replaced the painting , adjusting it carefully on the wall , and walked me to the ear . " You know what I think ? " he said . " I think that picture will be worth something someday . " Writing about Montgomery , but calling it Jeffersonville , Zelda had said , " Every place has its hours .... So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time and quality that appertains to nowhere else . " And she was right . The landscape is by Rousseau and something savage lurks in the extravagantly green gardens . The time is of the past . Zelda had come full circle to her origin . She was the American Girl living the American Dream , and she became mad within it .
