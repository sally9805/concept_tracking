Hard by the Swiss-German border , 50 green-coated hunters crouched in the bulrushes and cocked their scatter-guns . The hunters were edgy . It was 7:27 a.m. - three minutes left before they could start banging away legally at the flock of plump , brown-black Belchen ( coots ) paddling peacefully across the nippy surface of Lake Constance . Suddenly , a single shot sounded-then a rapid fusillade . Out of the reeds raced a Swiss patrol boat . " Wrho fired those shots ? " roared an angry official . " Not us , " answered a sullen German hunter . " It was those damned Tierschutzverein i.e. , S.P.C.A. people trying to warn the birds . " <P> Too Stupid to Worry . If so , the warning was wasted . Too dim-witted to be alarmed , the waterborne Belchen paid no attention to the eager marksmen closing in for the kill . At a range of less than 20 yds. , the hunters opened fire . The few Belchen that tried to escape were blasted out of the sky or cut down before they could finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds were slaughtered where they sat . Boat oars were used to administer the coup de grce . Explained one hunter : " If we waited for them to get into the air , we could wait all day . They wo n't fly unless they absolutely have to . " At least 600 Belchen were bagged within the two-hour legal hunting limit , but a few bloodthirsty hunters were still dissatisfied . Groused one : " There 's no fun unless you shoot lots of them . " <P> Most German sportsmen would trade a boatload of Belchen for a single Auerhahn ( European grouse ) , a bird so wily that one stuffed carcass is often all a man can show for a lifetime of shooting ( TIME , April 28 ) . The duckbilled , chicken-bodied coots that the gunmen slaughter in their annual Belchenjagd ( Belchen hunt ) are worthless as trophies , and dead birds are usually given to the nearest garbage collector . Some hunters claim that a Belchen is edible-if it is marinated for two weeks in buttermilk and roasted with chestnuts . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rather drink the buttermilk-and I do n't like buttermilk . " ) Still , more than 7,000 are shot each year . Explains one enthusiastic hunter : " They are n't good for anything , and there 's lots of them . So why not shoot them ? " <P> <P> Bad Form . Indignant bird fanciers conjure up new plans each year for halting the Belchenschlacht ( Belchen slaughter ) that stretches from November through February . But each year the hunters return . When Swiss and German S.P.C.A. members staged a protest meeting , angry hunters bombarded them with birdshot . So far , the hapless Belchen 's only hope is fog . On both the Swiss and German sides of Lake Constance , Belchen hunting in the fog is prohibited : a stray shot might nick a hunter , and this would be considered bad form , even for a Belchenjagd.
