In backyards and on beaches , wherever the sun shines brightly , multitudes of people have begun to stretch out like so many sausages on a griddle-all for the sake of a handsome , " healthy " tan . This rite of summer is warming , relaxing and so socially desirable that few sun worshipers heed the constant words of caution from doctors . Despite its appearance of health , a suntan apparently has little physical value ; too much sun over a long period of time may permanently damage the skin . <P> Overexposure . Tanning is actually the skin 's way of protecting itself . In a reaction to the sun 's rays , the skin thickens and dark pigment moves to the surface from underlying layers to help absorb later radiation . Dark-skinned persons have a larger supply of such protective pigmentation at the surface and can take considerably more sun without burning . Redheads , blondes and fair-skinned persons run the greatest risk . <P> Aside from a feeling of social wellbeing , the only proven beneficial effect of sunning is the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . In some cases , the sun also helps in clearing up acne and eczema , but excess exposure leaves the skin wrinkled , coarse and leathery like the back of a cowboy 's neck . In a study directed by Dermatologist John M. Knox of Baylor University College of Medicine in Houston , the most noticeable degenerative changes in skin tissues were found to be related not to age but to the areas of greatest exposure to the elements . " The visible cutaneous changes usually interpreted as aging , " says the report , " are apparently due largely , if not entirely , to sunlight . " <P> Warns the American Medical Association committee on cosmetics : " There is undeniable evidence that the effects of the sun are cumulative and at some point irreversible . The evidence is clear that chronic exposure to sunlight can be one of the major factors in the production of precancerous and cancerous conditions of the skin . " <P> Greasy Red Stuff . As evidence that most people are more than willing to risk sunburn 's dangers , store shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They prevent sunburn only to the extent that they block out burning ultraviolet rays from the sun , and they allow true tanning only to the extent that they let those same ultraviolet rays through . Perhaps the most effective sun-screening agent of all is a dark red veterinary petroleum jelly , used during World War II for life-raft survival . Trouble is , the stuff is indeed red ( although it loses its color when rubbed on ) ; it is also greasy and smells like tar . <P> Drug companies are now investigating lotions made with benzophenone compounds . The new products promise to be ten to 50 times more effective than present sun-screening agents , and as soon as safety tests are completed the benzophenones are expected to be commercially available , possibly by next summer . <P> For those who will listen , doctors strongly recommend gradualism as the best lotion of all : about 20 minutes the first day out , 40 minutes the second day , and 20 minutes longer each subsequent day . The truly cautious sun faddist should have started his daily doses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not quite so searing .
