Maybe a story about how they play ball in the Liga Venezolana de Beisbol Profesional , i.e. , the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League , does n't qualify as history , particularly if it is talking about what happened only last winter . But thinking about it , now that Jim Lonborg and the rest of the guys ( not to mention a few scared sportswriters ) are all safely back in the States again and comfortably into another big-league season , what went on south of the border last winter seems as though it could have taken place in another century . // Listen to the letter Jim wrote from Maracay , which is about 50 miles from Caracas , last December and see if you do n't agree . // I am now pitching for Los Tigres de Aragua Jim wrote . There are about 35 major-leaguers here , including Latin Americans such as Luis Aparicio ( who is Venezuela 's national hero ) , Luis Tiant and Cesar Tovar , as well as imports such as Bo Belinsky , George Scott and John Bateman . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players can speak the language either , so the communications problem slows us down  --  especially on paydays . Each player receives a minimum of $1,000 a month , plus expenses  --  $250 a month if he is single and $350 a month if he has his family with him . But there always is some hassle with management on payday . Dick Egan , who pitches for Spokane now , refused to pitch one night because the club held up his expense money , and Bob Burda of the Giants quit the club three times in one hour because the club reneged on promises it made to him . When I get paid I immediately convert the money into U.S. currency and put it in the safe-deposit vault at our hotel . // The man with whom we deal all the time is Crespo Verona , the club 's general manager , who breaks more appointments than you could imagine . He also speaks very poor English , so he brings in this guy we call Freddie the Freeloader to translate , and Freddie always confuses things even more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season . The first one , a native Venezuelan , was n't around long enough for me to remember his name . We lost our first four games , and the crowd got on him , especially when he coached at third base . The fans threw beer bottles at him after one game , and when some of them came out on the field and punched him , he quit . Carlos Pascual replaced him temporarily , but now Cal Ermer of the Twins organization is managing . He 's a class guy . He stands up for us in our negotiations with Verona , and he also has us winning . // There are six teams in the league , and three of them play their home games in the same stadium in Caracas . So none of our trips are too , too , long , not Boston-to- Anaheim long , anyway . // We travel to and from the various cities in taxis paid for by the club , but the way they drive down here I 'd rather walk . We had one cab driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance . He bumped pedestrians and bicycle riders off the road all the time , and when we complained he became very irritated . He reached into his pocket , pulled out a switchblade knife , pointed it at Dick Egan , who was riding up front , and said to him : " For you . " The next time he went for the knife Mel Queen found a machete under the front seat and handed it to Egan , who drummed a tune on the dashboard with it the rest of the trip . // This driver got so excited one day that he drove right through a toll booth , which is something you should never do in Venezuela because armed guards are on duty at every booth . This day the guard had his machine gun ready to fire at us , but the driver jumped out of the cab , raised his hands and yelled : " Lo siento mucho I 'm very sorry . " After that the rest of us were able to get off the floor . // Some of the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States . Dick Dietz of the Giants left here after getting involved in a riot at the park in Maracay . Dietz , who was a leading hitter and best RBI man , could n't catch one day because of an injury . We needed his bat in the lineup , so he was told to play left field . In the first inning he misjudged a fly ball and it cost us two runs , and when he ran in from the outfield the fans threw paper cups filled with ice at him . Later , in the top of the ninth , a ball hopped over his glove and two more runs scored . Dick really got showered with the hard stuff when he came back to the dugout that time , and he was so incensed that he tried to knock down some policemen and climb into the stands . Two days later he was on a plane heading for home . // Socially , things have been pretty slow , as you can imagine . When you take out a girl down here you also must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had was with a girl named Chela ; her mother , two sisters and a girl friend came along with us. // There is a good 18-hole golf course outside the front door of our hotel , and we always manage to get some local boys to caddie . They also make sure the iguanas , absolutely the ugliest creatures I 've ever seen , do n't get us . These iguanas are everywhere ; one day Mel Queen saw one at the bottom of the swimming pool . // I 'm glad you 're coming down . I think you 'll like Venezuela for a week  --  though certainly no more . See you soon , and be prepared for anything . // I thought I would be , but Caracas soon taught me better . On the day I arrived , the headlines read : BANDAS DE TERRORISTAS and DECRETADA SUSPENSION DE GARANTIAS . Even without a Berlitz refresher it was easy to translate the stories : Communist terrorists had assassinated an army major and wounded an army general in sniper attacks , and Venezuela 's President Ra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional guarantees . " Let 's get out of here now before the whole city blows up , " said Larry Claflin , the baseball writer for the Boston Record American . // After Claflin left , I found my own way from the airport to Maracay on the autopista . I drove through downtown looking for the Hotel Maracay for almost half an hour before I stopped the car and tried to get directions . One man shook his head , another waved his arms , and another listened , looked and walked away . I finally met a man who spoke halting English , and he not only gave me the proper directions to the hotel but a casual warning . " Up the road , " he said , " you see the National Guard . Go slow , or they shoot at your car . I already have five , six bullet holes in my car . " // The long road away from the city was darkened by the overhanging branches of the trees that line the dirt sidewalks . There was a military officers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Guard headquarters . I braked the car almost to a halt as I crept past . // To the left , set well back from the highway at the base of a mountain , was the Hotel Maracay , a strikingly modern building with four MPs stationed on the roof and a dozen more , none of whom looked older than 17 , standing around in the lobby . The sign at the reception desk said cheerfully , WELCOME TO MARACAY , in several languages . // I tried to reach Lonborg in his room but there was no answer , so I had him paged . " Se ? or Lonborg probably on the golf course , " said one of the clerks . He was . " Hurry up , " he said over the phone . " We 'll wait for you on the first tee . " I dressed and went out to the course , which is only a half-wedge shot from the hotel desk , and standing on the tee , clad only in bathing trunks , were Lonborg , Pitchers George Culver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Braves ' farm system and Pitcher-outfielder Mel Queen of the Reds . " I see you made it alive , " said Lonborg , grinning . " Yeah , " I said , " but it 'll take me six holes to calm down . How can you guys play golf under these conditions ? " I pointed to the four MPs standing on the hotel roof . " Oh , hell , " said Queen , " this is nothing compared to what happened in 1963 . One night in Caracas more than 200 MPs surrounded the ball park to protect the players during the riots , but the terrorists still blew up an auto showroom right across the street from the ball park . I was playing center field that night , but when I heard the explosion I beat our third baseman to the third-base dugout . Actually , it 's pretty quiet around here now . " // Queen left to play bridge at the swimming pool with some of the other Americans staying at the Maracay , and the rest of us went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to kibitz the bridge game . Soon Lonborg replaced Queen at the table , and then Tom Kelley calmly announced that he had to leave . He was going back to jail . // Jail ? Yes . One day when Kelley had been driving away from the hotel his car struck a woman pedestrian . It was ruled later that she had been intoxicated at the time of the accident , but Kelley was jailed because he would not sign a form that , in effect , would have made him liable for all of the woman 's medical expenses . Kelley had to get up every morning at 5:30 with the other prisoners , but the police would parole him at 9 o'clock so that he could get a decent breakfast and then go pitch , if it was his turn to , or play golf . At the end of the day he would go back to jail . After he left Venezuela to go back to the States in January  --  the legal technicality was straightened out by then  --  Kelley said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys have been in jail there 15 or 20 years because of minor auto accidents like the one I had . " // The next night there was a game in the stadium at Maracay , which Los Tigres won 2-1 as Dick Egan pitched a one-hitter to beat Luis Tiant and Caracas . There should have been elation in Los Tigres ' clubhouse , but instead there was a brawl . Carlos Pascual , who was filling in for Ermer as manager , claimed that Bob Burda had insulted him on the field , and he went after Burda in the dressing room . Egan , coming to Burda 's aid , hit Pascual on the jaw and Pascual grabbed a metal chair and tossed it at Egan . " Man alive , " George Scott of the Red Sox said afterward . " I 'm sort of tremblin ' , man . If that Egan ever ducked that chair 'd hit me in the face . I 'm gettin ' out of here for good , man . " Scott returned to the U.S. a week later . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong-armed young catcher of the Senators , entered the fight . " Dick , " he said to Egan , pointing a finger in the pitcher 's face , " you should n't have done that . " Egan admitted he was wrong , but suddenly the two of them were kicking and punching and swearing at each other . They fought steadily for 10 minutes , and when they were finally pried apart Ronnie Clark announced , " It 's Egan 5-4-1 on a split decision . " // " Great scene , was n't it ? " Lonborg asked as we pushed through the crowd of about a thousand that milled outside Los Tigres ' clubhouse . Spotting the rotund form of Freddie the Freeloader , Lonborg called him aside and said sternly , " Listen , Freddie , you better keep your mouth shut about what happened in there tonight . " Freddie stuttered a moment and answered , " Oh , you know me , I never say anything . " " We do know you , that 's the problem , " said Lonborg. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maracay and Valencia enjoy the type of rivalry that once existed between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants , and on this day more than 30 busloads of fans , as well as the Maracay Baja Marimba , accompanied Los Tigres to Valencia . A baja marimba consists of about a dozen gaily dressed musicians and dancers who do sort of a calypso throughout the game . Each team has its own baja marimba , and there is a kind of contest to determine which one can make the most noise during a game . When a Maracay player does something , his baja marimba strikes up the tune Maracay , Maracay , and all the Maracay supporters more or less thumb their noses at the rival fans . And when Pancho , the bat boy  --  really bat man  --  for Los Tigres , beats the umpire and the other club 's bat man in the race to dust off home plate , the noise in the Maracay stands crescendoes to headache intensity . // Lonborg pitched against Valencia that day , but he gave up four unearned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventh , and Cal Ermer , back on the job after his illness , removed him . // After the game there were bullfights back in Maracay . Little native boys shouted " malo " at Lonborg as he sat in the bull arena , and other people turned to stare at him throughout the fights . " Verona was on the radio , and he said something about my wanting to leave , " Jim explained . " The people are n't too happy about it . " The next day Lonborg tried again to meet with Verona , but the general manager evaded him . That night we drove to Caracas , where Los Tigres were playing the next day , and later we stopped at the airport where Jim purchased a one-way ticket to New York . " I 'll pitch one more game , but I 'm leaving here next Sunday no matter what they say , " Lonborg said . // In Caracas the next day there were more incidents involving the terrorists and the Venezuelan government , and that night at the ball park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're always shooting someone in Caracas , " said Carlos Pascual . " It 's something you get used to . " Four white-helmeted MPs , armed with machine guns and pistols , were stationed in the dugouts , and two hours before the game about 75 more MPs were in position throughout the stands to secure the stadium against any possible terrorist movements . The Central University owns the 35,000-seat stadium , which this night held less than 2,500 , but it can not afford to turn on the ballpark lights until 15 minutes before game time , and the darkness did not alleviate the tension among the players . Lonborg looked everywhere for Verona , but again the general manager was not to be found . " Bobby Maduro , the coordinator of Latin-American baseball , called and told me that for my own good I should stay down here , " said Lonborg . " He also said I 'd have to pay a $1,000 fine if I leave . " // Lonborg had his ticket to New York , and he planned to use it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow and get this all straightened out , " he said as he left with the rest of the Maracay players . I was leaving for New York the next day , so I decided to stay downtown overnight rather than drive to a hotel out near the airport . // " Yeah , you 'd be crazy to drive anywhere tonight , " said Lonborg . " They 're liable to shoot at anything . " // I did not sleep much that night , and the next day I was on a flight back to New York . For a few days I wondered how Lonborg had made out , and when I could not reach him in Boston I thought , " They kept him down there after all . " // Then one night there was a phone call from San Luis Obispo , Calif . It was Lonborg . " Yeah , I 'm back , " he said . " They let me go . " He laughed . " It was all quite an experience . But , you know , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
