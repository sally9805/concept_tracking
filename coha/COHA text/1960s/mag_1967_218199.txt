The difference between a man watching a play and a man watching a movie is the difference between a target and a gun . In theater , the action is aimed at the audience ; in cinema , the audience is aimed at the action . The two arts are antagonistic , and it is almost as hard to turn a good play into a good film as it is to make soup out of soap . The feat is attempted in three current attractions based on well-known stage works . Surprisingly , two of the three are films of blasting impact . <P> Dutchman is a racial shocker that slams through the spectator like a volt jolt from the third rail . Adapted for $60,000 from LeRoi Jones 's one-act play , the film describes in 55 minutes the brutal brief encounter between a black man and a white woman who meet in a subway car somewhere under Manhattan . The man ( Al Freeman Jr. ) looks like a young intellectual ; the woman ( Shirley Knight ) acts like a maniac in a miniskirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slides her thigh against his thigh . When he stammers , she strokes his lips and invites him to " do the thing " right there and then , and never mind the other passengers . When he refuses , she leaps to her feet and screams : " You middle-class black bastard , you liver-lipped white man , Uncle Tom Big Lip ! " In a black rage , he slugs her and then vomits all over the subway car his lifelong bellyful of hatred against the white man and all his works . When he subsides , the dame stabs him dead . <P> As a tirade against white wickedness , Dutchman makes no more sense than any other noisy blurb for black reaction . But as a dramatic shocker , it hits even harder on the screen than it did on the stage . The camera picks the onlooker up , sits him down hard only two seats away from that subway succubus , and then forces him to sit there with his palms sweating while the danger builds and builds and builds like the brain-stabbing squeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade , as written by Playwright Peter Weiss and performed by Britain 's Royal Shakespeare Company under the direction of Peter Brook , was the decade 's most cinematic drama . In a churning rowdydow of rant , cant , poetry , politics , music , magic , rite and ribaldry , the play moved across the stage like half a dozen movies mingling incompatibly on a giant screen . When Director Brook finally came to film the play , he simply let his cameras zig and zag and make lazy eights above the steamy business ; then he assembled his takes into a movie that is altogether faithful to the play and no less frazzle-dazzling to experience . <P> Time : 1808 . Place : a bathhouse in the asylum where Sade spent the last 13 years of his life-and actually did write plays for the inmates to perform . Playwright Weiss supposes that Sade once wrote a drama in the form of a debate between himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ian Richardson ) stands for social progress ; he believes that the only way to improve people is to improve the society they live in , that violent revolution is the best way to begin . Sade ( Patrick Magee ) stands on the contrary for moral autarchy ; he believes that the only way to change the world is to change the people who live in it , that revolutions revolve in a vicious circle and get humanity nowhere .
