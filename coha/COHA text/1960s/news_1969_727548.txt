txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ? 6 ? A spoilsport by the name of Arno Karlen writes in The Saturday Evening Post that the celebrated sexual revolution is mostly hot air , or more appropriately perhaps , hot print . American carnal customs have not altered appreciably , Mr. Karlen contends , since the 1920 's , a time of significant change . Mr. Karlen 's argument is persuasively buttressed with data . ( Sex may still be in the doldrums , but data about it are booming . It seems like just the other day that a person felt himself lucky to obtain a single sex datum he could rely on . ) Adjusting to a Myth In any case , it is hard to argue with Mr. Karlen 's data showing that the sexual revolution is mostly myth . Those of us who have adjusted to the myth , however , will find his debunking hard to take . It was not easy to make that adjustment . For several years we read and heard about the sexual revolution . The most outrageous changes were going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction , of course , was skepticism . It is natural for a man , or a woman for that matter , upon hearing that a sexual revolution is in full bloom , to go looking for it . This is the rubberneck urge in every human . If there is a fire or accident on the next corner , he wants to look at it . If there is a sexual revolution in the country , he wants to see for himself . Nothing Ever Happens After a time he began to feel misled . " Nothing outrageous ever happens to me , " he said . " The sexual revolution is a false alarm . " Those of us to whom nothing outrageous ever happened were not to find peace so easily , however . Our testimony was blithely set aside as editors , heating to the mass market 's hunger for more news about the sexual revolution , poured it on . As the reports became hotter and hotter , it became socially awkward to say , " Baloney ! Nothing outrageous ever happens to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hopelessly out of things , the sort of lepers who might turn up at parties wearing shoulder padding in double-breasted suits . The power of publicity is a mighty thing . When all about you society is said - to be one vast and evil fleshpot , and all that ever happens to you in the way of unusual sensuosity is an occasional warm bubble bath , brooding depression is very likely to set in . This led inevitably to facing some pretty terrible truths . As , for example . " The reason nothing outrageous ever happens to me is that I am too old , too square , too passe ever to be anything at a bacchanalia but a wet blanket . " Something good went out of life after that . It no longer mattered so much if you went out to dinner and dropped gravy on your necktie . The cologne bottle stood for days unopened . Henry Miller was still read occasionally , but now only for technical information as one might read a trade journal . This was the road to premature senility . Staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so those of us who decided that life could still be made worth living with an occasional bubble bath , jutted our jaws and accepted the sexual revolution . We might be excluded from it , but we would never chart our course against the future . After adapting , we even became rather fond of the sexual revolution , or what little we could glean about it from seats high up in the end zone . Th , letters to Playboy were always good for a laugh from an bid has-been . And the girls in the fashion magazines with their see-through dresses  --  well , yoll never saw girls dressed like that even at the fancier expense-account restaurants you went to , but you liked know , . ing that somewhere at a party there were undoubtedly girls wearing them . Comfort of a Heyday Passed The new literature was even comforting . Reading about the behavior of characters liberated by the sexual revolution made you grateful that your own heyday had passed before it b berran . What brutal demands of zeal and stamina ! And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening is exactly what we all suspected five years ago , namely , the same thing that has been happeniir , since Dad first learned to make gin in a bathtub . It cost a lot of us our youth learning to accept the sexual revolution . It is no comfort at all to know now that we were duped out of it . Oh , well , the joy of youth is mostly myth , too .
