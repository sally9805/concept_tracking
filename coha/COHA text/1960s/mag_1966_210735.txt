Rocks in the Wind <P> Sir : Anyone who can interpret Ray Charles 's Let 's Go Get Stoned as " a call to take part in a freedom march " July 1 has scrambled eggs in the head . Are double-entendres in music new ? Old songs like All or Nothing at All , All the Way and Come Fly with Me could n't pass a purity test . Was Kern a dirty old man when he wrote Easy to Love ! Was Hammerstein thinking lewd thoughts as he penned I 'm Just a Girl Who Ca n't Say No ? <P> CAROL COVIELLO New York City <P> Sir : Cleans and Dirties be damned . The Rolling Stones did n't invent the bawdy song : it 's been around for some time . As for LSD and pot , they are what 's happening , and it would be surprising if pop songs did n't take account of them . Rock ' n ' roll did n't write the script , it only made the scene . But the main thing is that rock ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since jazz . Groups like The Beatles and The Stones display a phenomenal melodic inventiveness and a harmonic and contrapuntal imagination that even us squares can dig . <P> ( PROF . ) Louis H. MACKEY Rice University Houston <P> Sir : Just because you ole hags ca n't appreciate good music or play gutiar worth a jellybean dose n't mean you have to go protesting about the Beatles . We think you 're jealous because your stupid magazine is n't selling as well as the Beatle Albems . For petes sake , why go knocking the Beatles around ? There doing better then you . By the way , both of us agree that Norwegian Wood and Day Tripper are not undecent . Where did you get that idea ? Take our advice : state the right facts or flake out ! <P> PATTY HUTCHESON , 14 SUSAN HUTCHESON , 12 Fairview , Mass . <P> <P> Having a Matzoth Ball <P> Sir : There is an interesting comparison between a Russian who promised to bury us , then was graciously hosted by New York , and a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , then was snubbed by the same city . King Feisal 's statement July 1 was a matter of his country 's policy ; Khrushchev 's was a threat . <P> DAVID B. PERRY Tuckahoe , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : I am concerned at the Final Solution to the Feisal Banquet Problem decided on by Mayor Lindsay . It is unfortunate that the State Department , New York and the Jewish community faltered so badly in this moment of international crisis . The obvious solution was to proceed with the banquet at some notable Jewish restaurant , such as Gluckstern 's or Poliacoff 's . After feasting on chicken soup with matzoth balls , gefilte fish , and boiled beef with horseradish , it is inconceivable that one drop of animosity toward Israel could remain in Feisal 's kingly body . To consolidate this initial victory , I would have suggested a Matzoth Balls for Feisal Fund , by means of which periodic shipments of matzoth balls and chicken soup would be sent to Feisal whenever the effects of the New York meal seemed to be wearing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valuable Time <P> Sir : Letter Writer Horvitz June 17 wonders what an academically minded person can bring to the military . It 's simple : his time .
