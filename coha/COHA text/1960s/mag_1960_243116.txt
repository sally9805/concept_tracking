A SEPARATE PEACE ( 186 pp. ) - John KnovWes-Macm/7/an ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> This excellent first nov.el is remarkable not only for the virtues it possesses but for the faults it lacks . There is little of the melodrama customary in books about adolescence . There is no Wolfeian confluence of the literary and the pituitary-the youthful poet growing an inch a month on a diet of a book a day . The author is no more sentimental or romantic about his hero than Stephen Crane was about the protagonist of The Red Badge of Courage . The books are similar in kind and ( to a considerable extent ) in quality : Author Crane 's young soldier had to endure the discovery of fear , and Author Knowles 's schoolboy must face the discovery of hatred-a bitter and homicidal knot of hatred in himself . <P> Compulsion . It is the summer of 1942 , and at Devon School in New Hampshire , the war has widened the gap between classes . The 17-year-old seniors , who will be drafted within a year , grunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jaws . But Gene <P> Forrester and the rest of the 16-year-olds , two years away from soldiering and left to themselves by a lackadaisical summer-session faculty , idle away the last of their childhood . Their leader , Gene 's roommate , is a wild , laughing youth named Phineas . He is the best athlete in the school , a boy of immense grace , no more capable of an awkward movement than is a cat . <P> Gene is a clever student , and Phineas laughs his way to a C average , but Gene takes no comfort from his crumb of superiority . His friend 's perfection galls him . Worse , Phineas has begun to prod Gene to follow him in nonsensical feats of daring . The athlete fearlessly climbs a tall tree by a riverbank , walks the length of a limb , and leaps far out into safe , deep water . Gene queasily repeats the stunt , and bitterly resents the compulsion that makes him do it . Soon Gene comes to suspect that everything Phineas does is calculated to humiliate him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea-a double leap . The boys climb the tree . Phineas balances jauntily on the limb , and Gene grimly clutches the trunk .. Abruptly the athlete falls . In the minutes that follow , as Phineas is carried to the infirmary with a shattered leg , Gene tries to shut away a terrifying fact : in an instant of hatred , he had jounced the limb his friend was standing on . <P> The summer ends , and the war comes nearer . The crippled Phineas returns to Devon School , announces gaily that the war is a fraud , and begins training the tormented Gene for the 1944 Olympics . But what happened in the tree obtrudes ike the maimed athlete 's dragging leg . In a weird kangaroo court , even Phineas is made to accept the truth . He staggers out of the room , breaks his leg in another fall , and this time dies . " My war ended before I ever put on a uniform , " Gene reflects . " I was on active duty all my time at school ; I killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single explication for a book as subtle and brilliant as Author Knowles 's would be idle . But one of the things the novelist seems to be saying is that the enemy Gene killed , and loved , is the one every man must kill : his own youth , the innocence that burns too hotly to be endured .
