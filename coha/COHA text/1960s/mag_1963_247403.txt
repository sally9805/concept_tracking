Marion Harper 's fierce ambition and celebrated metabolism have made him a living legend on Madison Avenue . He begins each day bent over a stationary bicycle in his $150,000 Westchester County home , pedaling up to four miles while he also races through a book propped on the handle bars . As chairman of Manhattan 's Interpublic Inc. , a corporate maze of advertising and related agencies , he has often worked 24 hours straight , taken a shower and a nap , then popped into a client meeting exuding a Florida glow ; he has personally won such accounts as Buick , Coca-Cola , Swift , Westinghouse . Ever since , at 32 , he became the chief of McCann-Erickson , the base on which he built Interpublic , he has driven to create the world 's biggest advertising complex . Last week , at 47 , he achieved his goal . <P> With a few pen strokes in his chastely modern board room , Harper acquired the $80 million in billings of Erwin Wasey , Ruthrauff &; Ryan , itself a product of an earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifts Inter-public 's billings to just about $500 million , well ahead of venerable J. Walter Thompson ( 1962 billings : $420 million ) , up to now the world 's biggest advertising company . Harper himself had sought out Erwin Wasey 's owners , Howard D. Williams , 74 , and his son , <P> David B. Williams , 44 , and persuaded them to sell out for some $5,000,000 in what he calls " the largest agency deal ever made wholly for cash . " <P> Comes the Revolution . Harper 's rivals were at once skeptical , fearful and envious . Says the chairman of one top agency : " While I find Marion unattractively impersonal and ruthless , he does seem to be a marvelous organizer , and his mental capacity is immense . " Most of all , skeptics and supporters wondered how Harper would cope with the problem of " client conflict . " For the sake of secrecy , advertising agencies seldom represent two products that clash headon . But , among many other conflicts , Erwin Wasey has Tuborg beer , Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has Genesee beer , Old Charter bourbon , Buick and Standard Oil ( N.J. ) . <P> To critics , Harper persuasively argues that " you ca n't judge this by the old stereotypes . There is a revolution going on in advertising . " He means that he is leading the revolution . In a frenetic drive for diversification under highly centralized management , Harper since 1961 has made Interpublic a management company presiding over a cluster of separate but equal subsidiaries that offer something for every client 's desire . Under it are a big agency ( McCann-Erickson ) , two cozily small agencies ( McCann-Marschalk and Johnstone , Inc. ) , three foreign-based agencies in Britain , Switzerland and South Africa , and separate companies to stew over market research , sales promotion , public relations and far-out future planning . Erwin Wasey , says Harper , will keep its separateness and its secrets , will maintain the two Williamses at the helm . But it will give Interpublic new offices in five foreign countries and three U.S. cities . " What we have added , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , volume in facilities . "
