To succeed in Mississippi politics since Reconstruction has meant being a segregationist , and James P. Coleman succeeded . " Those who propose to mix the races in our public schools might as well try to dip the Atlantic dry with a teaspoon , " he said as Governor in 1956 , two years after the Supreme Court school integration ruling . And , as he had promised he would , he signed laws aimed at thwarting that decision . <P> But Coleman was never a militant racist . He stayed clear of the Citizens Councils , scoffed at the notion of state " nullification " of federal law , spoke out against violence , and invited the FBI into his state to investigate racial murder . In 1960 , he was one of the few Deep South leaders to support John Kennedy for the Democratic presidential nomination . In 1963 this record cost him the gubernatorial election . <P> Attack &; Defense . Last month President Johnson nominated Coleman to fill a vacancy on the nine-member Federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , which covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , and handles much civil rights litigation . Mississippi is the only state not currently represented on the court . Custom dictated that Johnson pick a Mississippian , and ironbound Senate tradition demanded that his choice be approved by the state 's Senators-James Eastland , who happens to be chairman of the Judiciary Committee , and John Stennis . Given all the circumstances , Coleman seemed to be the best available . <P> Civil rights groups lined up before a Judiciary subcommittee last week to demand his rejection . Representative John Conyers , a Negro member of the House Judiciary Committee , summed up : " Throughout his public statements runs a consistent theme . He is the only person with the legal experience and skill to consistently outmaneuver the federal courts , Congress and the Executive . He is the thinking man 's segregationist . " Star witness for the Administration was Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach , who argued that Coleman 's steady defense of law and order in the hostile atmosphere of Mississippi was " worth a hundred campaign speeches . " And , like President Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now believed that " separation of individuals by reason of color and color alone is dead in this country and it is finished . " <P> <P> Approval Ahead . It was a foregone conclusion that the three-man subcommittee , consisting of Eastland , Sam Ervin of North Carolina and Roman Hruska of Nebraska , would act favorably on the nomination . It did . Liberal members of the parent committee forced a delay of a vote by the full committee until this week , but there seemed to be little doubt that it would recommend Senate approval .
