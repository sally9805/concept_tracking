txt Washington , Dec. 9 - President Johnson said today that he has sometimes " bristled and choked " because of injustices done to his daughters because he is in the White House . But he said he has n't written a letter yet as he recalled former President Truman 's angry letter to a music critic who had panned the singing of his daughter , Margaret . Despite their goldfish bowl existence , however , the President said he doubted his daughters could have a more satisfactory life than to be the children of public servants . Hurts Him Very Much But when your children " are pulled in unjustly , charged with this or that , and it is untrue , it hurts me very much , " he confided in a taped radio and television interview . " You just think what could happen to Luci if she had a paper cup of beer . You can think what could happen if Lynda went thru an orange light and her brake did n't hold . It is front page . " At one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . but I have bristled and choked . " ' Asked how it affects a commander-in-chief to know his son-in-law is going to war , the President replied : " I guess you are glad that you have a son-in-law who has had the training , several years in an elite group like the marines , who have prepared and equipped him to look after his country 's interests . It is pretty hard to appreciate a man enough who is willing to give his life for your liberty . " Luci More Feminine The President and Mrs. Johnson had similar assessments of their daughters . They agreed that Luci is the more feminine one , while Lynda has a questing , intelligent mind . Mrs. Johnson described Luci as " sort of the eternal Eve . " " I see in Lynda her mother everytime she writes a check . " her father said . " I see in Luci her grandmother every time she ca n't find her checkbook , and does n't know what the balance is.
