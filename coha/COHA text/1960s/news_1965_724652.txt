txt New York City is facing a possible " serious situation " in its water supply this year , and a summer conservation program will probably be necessary . Armand D'Angelo , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , said yesterday that lie was concerned that the ! city 's reservoirs were only at 38.1 per cent of their capacity yesterday , a level far below , normal for this time of year . A prime factor in determining whether the city will he short of water this year wil ! be the rainfall between now and June . Mr. D'Angelo said he was heartened that the supply had risen from an all-time low percentage of 24.8 last Feb. 5 , but he said the rise was not so great as it should be for this time of year . Total Capacity Rises Although the Feb , 5 supply was a record low on a percentage basis , the reserves have been lower because total capacity has increased over the years . For instance , the 33 pet ' cent of capacity low point reached during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage than the 24.8 per cent of las ; Feb. 5 because the total capacity of the reservoirs in 1950 was 253 billion gallons , compared with 476.5 billion gallons now . In mid-February , predictions of heavy snows in the watershed areas had led water authorities to expect that spring runoffs to the reservoirs would raise water levels to normali measurements  --  near capacity ? , by June 1 , when the summer depletion period usually begins . On Feb. 18 a spokesman for Mr. D'Angelo accordingly said : water supply at the moment is considered adequate , although we 're not yet out of the woods . " But the heavy snows failed to materialize . Yesterday the city 's reservoir held 181,6 billion gallons of water , compared with their capacity of 476.5 billion gallons . The reservoir percentages ranged from 18.5 at Pepacton to 07.3 in the Croton system . The figures were made available by Ed-i J. Clark , chief engineer of the Bureau of Water Supply. , On March 18 , 1964 , the over- , all percentage was 69.4 . Two ! years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water conservation program  --  the percentage was 39.8 . Yesterday Commissioner D ' Angelo said he was " reviewing , and evaluating " the water situ-. ation and would submit his findings to Mayor Wagner . When . these are submitted , he said . he : will decide whether to recommend water conservation meas-i ures , including possible requests ! for public cooperation . Mr. D'Angelo said he planned , to inspect the watersheds next week , probably with engineersa to determine how much snow ; and ice is left for the spring runoff . He said , however , that ! city water aides in the Dela- ! ware . Croton and Catskill : T:ieYosle. rrnand . D'Angela areas had reported " the thinnest snow cover for this date in , many years . " " ' While I surely hope for im- ! proved rainfall this spring , " Mr. D'Angelo declared , " I can not gamble with the future . If conservation measures are necessary , we will have to take them . " Restrictions May Be Asked A conservation step that might be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lawn sprinklers to certain hours two days a week instead of the three days a week that have been permitted in recent years . Also , persons may be again asked to cut their use of water . The city 's water system has been hit by the longest dry spell on record . It began in July . 1961 , and , has been broken only by an occasional month cr two of average rainfall . The cumulative rainfall shortage to March 1 has been 41.17 inches , about five inches less than the total normal rainfall for an entire year . Yesterday Arthur C. Ford , president of the Board of Water Supply ? the agency that develops new water sources ? said the $200 million Cannonsvide reservoir should be ready for full use by the end of this year . Meanwhile , the city is drawing about 430 million gallons a day from this basin . Spring rains will determine how much the city can take this year from the still-incornpleted Cannonsville. reservoir . The city is required by law to make releases of water during hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to help maintain the river 's flow , These releases , however , are not normally called for until mid-June . Consumption of city water is running close to a daily average of 1.2 billion gallons a day , a figure that has held fairly constant for several years .
