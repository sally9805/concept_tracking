Cast a Giant Shadow , another exercise in movie biography , may be filed as a case of mistaken identity : any resemblance to persons living or dead is sacrificed to make elbowroom for Hero Kirk Douglas . The ostensible hero is Colonel David " Mickey " Marcus , a Jewish graduate of West Point who became New York City 's crime-busting commissioner of correction under Mayor Fiorello La Guardia , was a wartime adviser to President Roosevelt and helped to organize the Nurnberg trials . In 1948 , after serving as unofficial military adviser to Israel , he became supreme commander of the Israeli armies fighting the Arabs around Jerusalem , was accidentally killed only hours before the U.N . ceasefire . <P> Shadow expends most of its energy on flame-licked scenes of the Arab-Israeli war , and Douglas expends his trying to find a clue to the character of Marcus ; but the smoke screens dreamed up by Writer-Director Melville Shavelson are nearly impenetrable . As Marcus ' unhappy wife , Angie Dickinson stays at home , smiling through her fears and reminiscing in murky flashbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senta Berger manages to make half-baked fiction look like a whole girl . Guest Star John Wayne , perhaps inadvertently , turns his role as a Pentagon overlord into an uncanny impersonation of President Johnson , while Luther Adler , sporting a ludicrous Ben-Gurion hairdo , pretends to be an Israeli leader named Zion . <P> The film 's dialogue suggests an uneasy truce between Zionism and Hollywood hipsterism . " We 've already lost 6,000,000 people , " snaps one patriot . ' Do you want us to try for seven ? " To top the evidence that Shadow should not be taken seriously , if at all , Frank Sinatra pops in as a soldier-of-fortune silot who quips , " Hey , do n't leave me here alone , I 'm anti-Semitic . " Musical-comedy exuberance dominates a battle scene that has Sinatra aloft in a Piper Cub , bombing Egyptian tanks with Seltzer bottles and spraying soda at their planes . By then , the movie has trimmed its theme to fit the formula of any Clannish catered affair .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
