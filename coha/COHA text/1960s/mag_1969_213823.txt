Americans on the War Divided , Glum , Unwilling to Quit <P> NEARLY five years after the 1965 buildup , Americans are increasingly impatient for a way out of Viet Nam , skeptical about the outcome of the fighting and ambivalent about the means of ending it . More than a third of the public want immediate , unconditional withdrawal of U.S. forces-a sizable figure in support of a policy that until recently was overwhelmingly held to be unthinkable and disastrous . <P> Yet , considering the outpouring of antiwar feeling on Moratorium Day , it is remarkable how much support remains for the policy of ending the war in honorable fashion , short of complete abandonment of South Viet Nam . The President enjoys considerable support ; a majority backs him on the rate of troop withdrawal and on the matter of self-determination for South Viet Nam . <P> Seeming contradictions abound in the American mood . Four-fifths of the nation profess to be " fed up and tired of the war " ; yet half do not want to see the U.S. " cut and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present pace of troop withdrawals is about right or too fast . Nearly half of the public would favor continued withdrawal even if it meant collapse of the Saigon government , and more than 40% feel that the country will probably go Communist despite U.S. efforts . Yet a majority still hope to preserve a non-Communist regime in Saigon . <P> These are findings of a new TIME-Louis Harris poll to determine how much support exists among Americans for the war and for alternatives in pursuing or ending it . In order to identify the differences between the general public and those expected to be better informed on the war 's complexities , the TIME-Harris interviewers polled two samples-1,650 members of a cross section of the entire population and 1,118 national and community leaders . The second group included only public officials , chiefs of minority and dissident organizations , business executives , editors , leaders of educational and voluntary institutions-those whose collective voice registers loudest in public debate . <P> The results suggest that growing impatience with the war especially among the leaders-could undermine President Nixon 's efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also show that Nixon has managed to win broad support for two crucial points of his Viet Nam policy-withdrawal of American troops pegged to " Vietnamization " of the war , and holding out for the right of South Vietnamese self-determination . Fully three-quarters of the public polled favor the President 's program of troop withdrawals . But half of the general public would be willing to back Nixon in one last attempt to escalate and win . <P> <P> Still , reports Harris , a mood of pessimism-not unlike that of France following its 1954 debacle in Indo-China - pervades the country . " The irony , " says Harris , " is that the American mood is as pessimistic as it is without a Dienbienphu. "
