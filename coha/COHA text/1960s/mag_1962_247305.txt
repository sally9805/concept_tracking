While two constitutional Presidents in Latin America have left office in the face of a coup in recent months , another steps down this week in more auspicious circumstances . Colombia 's Alberto Lleras Camargo. 56 , the quiet Liberal statesman who has saved his violently partisan country from civil war , completes his full four-year term . When he leaves , he will pass on the seal of presidential office to a man who , under other circumstances , might be his most dangerous enemy-Guillermo Leon Valencia , a Conservative . <P> Architect of Union . Lleras started out as a reporter for Bogota 's prestigious El Tiempo , but soon gravitated to politics . At the age of 24 , he was El Tiempo 's editor in chief ; two years later , at 26 , he had become speaker of the Chamber of Deputies ; by age 30 , he was Minister of the Interior . In 1945 , when President Alfonso Lopez resigned in a dispute with Congress , Lleras. by then Foreign Minister , was tapped to serve out the term.His next job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Union . During seven years , Lleras , almost singlehanded , transformed it into today 's far stronger Organization of American States , whose charter he largely wrote . <P> Home again in 1957 , leading the battle against Army Dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla , Lleras persuaded leather-tough Conservative Boss Laureano Gomez to form a coalition , and out of this alliance between historic foes came Colombia 's unique National Front pact , under which both parties agreed to alternate the presidency for 16 years . Soon after , a coordinated popular uprising by Liberals and Conservatives swept Rojas out of office . The choice for President : Lleras Camargo , the only man on whom both strong-minded parties could agree . <P> Approval at the Polls . Senseless murder by bandits continues to plague the backlands , but the National Front has sharply reduced the random political assassinations between Liberals and Conservatives , which once threatened ultimate chaos . When election time came round again last May , the Front won an almost 2 to 1 endorsement at the polls . Colombia 's voters approved the nation 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of attracting foreign investment . The national debt has been cut , dollar reserves are up . An ardent champion of the Alliance for Progress , Lleras has pushed through land reform , higher income taxes , the first civil service in the history of Colombia . Though the Communists rail , he stands firm against Castro and flatly tells his people : " The new Cold War theater is clearly our hemisphere . " <P> Visibly tired and frankly ready to be relieved of his demanding job ( he has been counting the days by crossing them off on his desk calendar ) , Lleras plans to take a rest , then visit the U.S. with his wife for a medical check ( he suffered a mild heart attack four months ago ) . After that , he may accept an offer to be editor of Bogota 's new Liberal newspaper . La Tarde , and will enjoy the opportunity " to read a book in peace once again . " Says Lleras : " The most important thing my successor will possess is having gained office in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite a heritage for a departing President to leave behind .
