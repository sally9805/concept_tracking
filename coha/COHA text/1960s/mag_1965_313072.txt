Arrayed in gold pajamas and a brown silk robe , the nation 's most closely watched convalescent leaned back in a green reclining chair and made a rare admission . " Very frankly , " said Lyndon Johnson , " this is a good time to get a little rest . I have been rather tired for some time . " <P> The President showed it . Almost no official visitors were admitted to his third-floor suite at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Md. , last week . Johnson limited his reading to essential reports such as the CIA 's daily intelligence summary , rarely used the multi-button telephone console at his bedside . " I think he is weaker than anyone thought , " observed White House Press Secretary Bill Moyers . " I think the pace of the last 20 months has accumulated weariness that was not evident until the operation . " <P> " Keep On Doing . " This was a sharp change of tone from the first three days after the operation that removed his gall bladder and a kidney stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President had seemed to be simmering with energy-as patients often do immediately following surgery . The anesthetic had barely worn off when he was signing bills , dictating telegrams , calling relatives with medical bulletins , approving appointments , and largely behaving as if he were still in the oval office . <P> Summoning in a four-man press pool , Johnson chatted about the amazing productivity of the 89th Congress .

" <P> The following day , Johnson spent 45 minutes reviewing domestic and foreign problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State Dean Rusk , who brought him a get-well message from the Soviet leaders and a rundown on the crises in Indonesia and Rhodesia ( see THE WORLD ) . Then the postoperative euphoria started wearing off . Taken off sedation , the President slept fitfully , some nights for as little as two hours ! He was restless during the day . " While I was there , " said Moyers , " he spent part of his time in his chair , and he got back on the bed to rest , and he got out of the bed again after he regained some of his strength . " <P> Hello from Him . At last Johnson 's doctors , as Moyers put it , insisted " that he take every opportunity to rest ; that he maintain a very minimum schedule the next few weeks . " As a result , his hard-working staff was able to relax for the first time in months . Moyers , who normally is on call 24 hours a day , even managed to catch a few innings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
