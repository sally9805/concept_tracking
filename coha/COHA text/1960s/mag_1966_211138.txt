None of the seven acacia trees in the front yard of Sam Morse 's home in La Feria , Texas , seem different from any of the others-or from their countless cousins that thrive in the Lower Rio Grande Valley . But to thousands of Mexican-Americans in the area , one of Morse 's 30-ft. acacias has suddenly become " God 's tree , " an object of awe and veneration . That particular acacia lost its anonymity in mid-July when a stream of tea-colored " water " began spewing from a knothole in a limb 25 ft. above the ground . Local Mexican-Americans soon saw religious significance in the " crying tree " ; they began dropping by to touch it , rub its mysterious fluid on their bodies , and even to drink the stuff . <P> Stories inevitably spread about miraculous cures effected by the acacia 's water . A blind woman said her sight was restored after the acacia 's liquid was poured into her eyes . Open sores on a child 's face were reported washed away . Arthritic pain and lung congestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visitors were arriving at the Morse property from as far away as San Antonio and Monterrey , Mexico . <P> 50 Admission . To control the crowds and compensate for his inconvenience , Morse erected an 8-ft. - high chain-link fence around the tree , hired two gatekeepers and began charging visitors 50 admission to touch the magic acacia and carry its liquid away in pop bottles . His curiosity piqued by the spreading excitement over the acacia , Tree Surgeon Grover Smith arrived from nearby Harlingen , and somehow climbed the tree without Morse 's knowledge . His deflating conclusion , which was printed in the local press : insects had bored " into a little old bitty knothole and the tree just started bleeding . " It was sap , not water , flowing out of the tree , Smith insisted . <P> The skeptical surgeon was backed up by Houston Botanist Robert Vines in a terse explanation . " Sam Morse 's tree , " he said , " is simply an ordinary Leucaena pulverulenta , better known as an Acacia , a Lead-tree or a Great Lead-tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pressure inside the tree 's vessels forces its abundant supply of sap to run through the opening . " <P> Despite such expert testimony and a sudden halting of the sap flow late last month , Rio Grande Valley residents have continued to pour into La Feria to share in the " miracle " of Morse 's acacia . On Labor Day weekend alone , some 1,500 passed through the chain-link fence . Scorning science , and showing that he knows a miracle when he sees one , Morse has been making plans to surround the tree with paving stones and to erect an awning to shield waiting patrons from the hot Texas sun . Meanwhile , he is waiting patiently for his bountiful acacia to cry again .
