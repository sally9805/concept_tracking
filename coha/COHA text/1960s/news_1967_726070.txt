txt City Controller Mario A. Procaccino yesterday described three hospital affiliation programs here as " a morass of mismanagement " that had shortchanged both patients and taxpayers . " The loss to the city is incalculable , " Mr. Procaccino said in a preliminary report on three contracts under which voluntary , nonprofit hospitals provide medical services at municipal hospitals . The contracts are between Fordham and Miscricordia , Elmhurst and Mount Sinai , and Queens General and Long Island Jewish Hospitals . The Controller said that although the Department of Hospitals was responsible for enforcing the contracts , ' ' it becomes obvious almost immediately that the department through ignorance or abdication of responsibility just does n't know what is going on . " ' Massive and Messy ' Mr. Procaccino called the affiliation program " massive and messy , " and said that under the " loosely drawn and loosely enforced " contracts , both patients and taxpayers suffered from : cMismanagement , misplacement , misuse and loss of equipment . ( INtiaste , larceny and inadequate patient care . CSupplementation of payrolls in violation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two payrolls. cDiversion of funds to items not properly expendable under the program . Photostatic copies of large liquor bills , party bills , hotel bills for staff physicians attending out-of-town conferences , and bills for physicians ' memberships in professional organizations  --  all paid by the city ? were appended to the report . The Controller questioned the propriety of such payments , which an aide called " irregular . " Mr. Procaccino said in a news conference that Mayor Lindsay I had done nothing to correct these deficiencies , although they had been noted in a report of this study group last spring . The Mayor , reacting to the report in a statement , supported the concept of hospital affiliation , but reiterated his demand for greater public accountability . " Many , if not most , of the lax or improper conditions , " ' beenLindsay said , " could have ' been eliminated or corrected by ' now , however , if the office of the Controller had undertaken in 1963-64-65 thorough audits of the type Controller Procaccino launched when he took office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Last fall , State Health Department officials found some municipal hospitals so short of life-saving equipment that they ordered respirators , electrocardiogram machines , and resuscitators while making on-the-spot tours of the 21 municipal hospitals . Last month , State Senator Seymour R. Thaler , Queens Democrat , r , chared that the city hospitals had lost $100-million through waste , neglect . payroll padding , transfer of equipment , and other asserted abuses . The Controller alleged that some anesthesiologists on the payroll of Fordham Hospital ' shortchanged the city institution and worked instead at Misericordia Hospital . They then doctored the records , he charged , to indicate they had put in the required time at Fordham . Officials Decline Comments " We have evidence to show , " the report said , " that there was a shuttling back and forth of these physicians with time records so maintained as to make it appear that the requisite amount of time had been spent at Fordham Hospital . " Misericordia Hospital officials declined to comment on the charges until after a study of the report . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory staffed by three city employes who had performed 702 Protein Bound Iodine examinations for Mount Sinai 's private patients . He said 54 additional examinations had been performed for the private patients of a private doctor , without compensation to the city . The Controller charged that the Elmhurst Hospital administrator had been unaware that the laboratory existed . Dr. S. David Pomrinse , associate medical director of Mount Sinai Hospital , said that both hospitals exchanged laboratory work for their mutual convenience . He said Mount Sinai performed laboratory work for Elmhurst patients who needed tests for virology , serology , blood fat , radiation therapy , and some bacteriological tests . In exchange , he said , Elmhurst performed the P.B.I . tests . Meant To Save Money " It makes no sense to set up two laboratories , " Dr. Pomrinse said . " This is meant to save the city money . " The liquor and hotel bills , and bills for physicians ' membership in professional organizations and physicians ' attendance at out-of-town conferences , were defended by Dr. Peter Rogatz , director of Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bills for dues for professional organizations are the normal , professional responsibility of a doctor , " Dr. Rogatz said . " If such a person is on full-time salary , it is standard practice in all good hospitals to pay these legitimate expenses for full-time people . " A spot-check found that practice prohibited by several local hospitals , including New York Hospital , unless funds were specifically set aside for it . Dr. Rogatz also defended bills of $500 and $371 for house staff graduation parties , and one of $14 for liquor , asserting : " It seems to be not unreasonable for an organization to provide some kind of year-end celebration . We had confirmation front the city that they thought this was a reasonable practice . " Equipment Stolen Mr. Procaccino asked , in his report : " Would not similar parties , at the taxpayer 's expense , in other city agencies , also be good for morale ? But is this fair to the taxpayer ? " The Controller said that $6 , - 871.62 worth of equipment at Elmhurst Hospital had been stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner of Hospitals of these thefts , and only some of the items were reported stolen or missing to the police . " Dr. Pomrinse said the equipment was reported missing to the hospitals ' security guards , whom he assumed had notified both the Hospitals Department and the police . The Controller also charged that 40 persons were on the payrolls of both Queens General Hospital and Long Island Jewish Hospital " in direct violation of the affiliation contract . " Dr. Rogatz said that " what is involved here is not supplementation , and is very much in the interest of the patient . " He explained that the employes , who worked at night and received compensatory time off during the day , were paid extra . to work in the daytime . " I do not regard this as supplementing the salary , and therefore not prohibited by the contract , " he said . The Controller reported that $90,000 worth of equipment purchased by the city for use at Fordham Hospital was delivered to , and used at , Misericordia Hospital , because proper electrical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
