( 12,427 ) DURIE ( Kerr ) MALCOM ( Isabel O. Cooper , 11,304 ) . We have no birth date . She was born Kerr , but took the name of her stepfather . She first married Firmin Desloge , IV . They were divorced . Durie then married F. John Bersbach . They were divorced , and she married , third , John F. Kennedy , son of Joseph P. Kennedy , one time Ambassador to England . There were no children of the second or third marriages . <P> This brief item appeared in a 1957 book that belongs on any alltime worstseller list : The Blauvelt Family Genealogy . It was one of some 25,000 capsule biographies , taking up 1,100 pages , of the descendants of Gerrit Hendricksen ( who later became known as Blauvelt ) , a Dutchman who helped settle New York in 1638 . Yet it was to set off a great search-one that tried to distinguish between fact and fiction , between records and rumors . For in its deadpan way , the item plainly said that John Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bouvier Kennedy . <P> Declining to Deny . Just who first spotted the paragraph about Family Member No. 12,427 remains unknown . But around the spring of 1961 , photostatic copies of the page from The Blauvelt Family Genealogy began to be passed around . The person showing the page usually knew no more than was printed on it , and , depending on who he was , he either accepted it as fact or thought it a good joke . Newsmen heard about it and , understandably , became curious . The best , fastest , most direct way of checking seemed to be by asking the parties involved : President Kennedy and Mrs. Durie Malcolm Bersbach Desloge Shevlin . <P> Both sides declined to deny . White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger even put his refusal to comment off the record . Durie Malcolm , now Mrs. Thomas H. Shevlin , either scoffed at the whole thing as too " ridiculous " to discuss or dismissed queries with the comment : " I 'm bored with this . " The White House reasoning , no doubt , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into print , whereas off-the-record " no comments " would leave it in a vague limbo where it might eventually die . <P> All this only whetted interest . In the absence of forthright denials , the story-and the rumors-grew . Last March , The Realist , a shabby Greenwich Village periodical , published the fact of the Blauvelt genealogical entry as an " expose . " So , a bit later , did Birmingham 's antiSemitic , anti-Negro circular , The Thunderbolt ( " The White Man 's Viewpoint " ) . So , in June , did The Winrod Letter , a oamphlet put out by the Rev. Gordon Winrod of Little Rock . Racist organizations in the South and crackpot groups everywhere photostated these pieces and sent them out as junk mail by the scores of thousands ; it is estimated that at least 100,000 were received by mailbox holders in Massachusetts alone .
