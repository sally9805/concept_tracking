MISS LEONORA WHEN LAST SEEN by Peter Taylor . 398 pages . Obolensky. $4.95 . <P> <P> Most writers drop a pebble in some domestic pool and write about the splash . Peter Taylor waits , and from the vantage point of memory , recalls the ever-widening rings of ripples that slowly subside as if nothing had disturbed the surface . <P> Taylor 's territory is the borderland of Kentucky and Tennessee before , during , and immediately after the Depression . In these 16 stories , his themes are love , marriage , childhood . As he peels away the layers of the past , he finds in an early-morning walk to a drugstore or a family dinner implications of lives changed , misdirected , or ruined . In What You Hear from ' Em ? , Aunt Muncie , the Negro housekeeper , retains a measure of dignity only as long as she can believe that the two white boys she raised for a widowed doctor will come back home to live . But when she realizes that " they ai n't never coming back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger foolishness . " <P> To Taylor , love has no winners . In Reservations , a young couple on their wedding night cruelly expose to each other all their past deceits , then try to heal the wounds in a disturbed embrace . <P> In Cookie , marriage has become an elegant pretense ; over the dinner table , a philandering husband can only communicate with his wife about the quality of the meal . " Fine , fine , fine , " he murmurs . And to outsiders , " fine " is how she would describe her life . <P> Author Taylor is not for every taste . Some of his stories fail to get off dead center . He does not point ; he does not posture ; he does not underscore . But as he pokes through the dusty closets of memory , Taylor conjures up ghosts that will continue to walk abroad in the reader 's imagination long after the dust of indifference has settled on his flashier contemporaries .                @ @ @ @ @
