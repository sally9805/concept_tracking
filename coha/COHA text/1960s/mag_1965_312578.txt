The most critical decision to come before the World Council of Churches since its founding 16 years ago is the choice of a successor to the Rev. Willem Visser ' t Hooft , 64 , its omnicompetent general secretary . Last week , meeting in the improbable town of Enugu , Nigeria , the council 's 100-member central committee showed its deep concern over the decision by rejecting one officially nominated successor and ordering a search for someone else . <P> Dismay . The man whom these churchmen were expected to nominate is the Rev. Patrick Rodger of Scot land 's Episcopal Church , choice of the council 's powerful 16-man executive committee at a meeting held in Tutzing , Germany , last August . There were quiet complaints even then about Rodger , a scholarly theologian who has been on the council 's staff , as head of its Faith and Order Department , only since 1961 . He is well liked in Western ecumenical circles but virtually unknown to Orthodoxy and the " new churches " of Asia and Africa , which are playing an increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's action were Visser ' t Hooft , who was not consulted , and Rodger himself , who was given 24 hours to decide whether he would accept the nomination . He said he would . <P> Why had the churchmen at Tutzing chosen Rodger ? Most council observers believed that the executive committee wanted to rearrange the power structure of the ecumenical movement . The general secretary is technically a servant of the council 's 209 member churches , but some clerics felt that Visser ' t Hooft runs the council as a private fief . With the little-known and unassertive Rodger in office , the executive committee would clearly have more authority . <P> Altering the Course . At Enugu , op position to Rodger came from the Rus sian Orthodox representatives , who appreciate Visser ' t Hooft 's great interest in keeping open the lines of communication between churches on both sides of the Iron Curtain . African and Asian leaders were also disturbed about en trusting the secretaryship to an inexperienced ecumenist . " It is not enough to keep the council on course , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these times of change , the course must be altered more than once . Visser ' t Hooft is a leader who knows how to adapt to all these new situations . " With the meeting hopelessly dead locked , the central committee created a nominating committee to check out new candidates - including , if they wish , Patrick Rodger . Visser ' t Hooft , who wants to retire , will stay on until his successor is found .
