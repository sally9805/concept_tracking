Justice Department officials hailed the settlement of the Birmingham racial dispute as " a tremendous step forward for Birmingham , for Alabama and for the South generally . " Burke Marshall , Assistant Attorney General , made that comment at a news conference after returning from a negotiator 's role in Birmingham . Attorney General . Robert F. Kennedy was at his side . Mr. Kennedy said the great lesson of the Birmingham crisis was the importance of whites and Negroes sitting down together and talking ? " the importance of getting a dialogue . " " The alternative to discussion is going to be great violence , " Mr. Kennedy said , " and it is going to be turning these matters over to extremists on both sides . " He said the white extremists were those who " think Negroes should not wear a tie and ca n't discuss them without using a swear word , " and Negro extremists those who " think that wnite people have mistreated the Negroes for such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " All of us in all sections of the country have a great lesson to learn , " he continued , " the importance of getting a dialogue going between people in the North and the South . We really // have to start ' having greater exchanges so , that a Southern Senator can ? talk to . Burke Marshal , or the Attorney , , Genehl to a Southern Governor and not lose votes for : him . and a Northern . politician . can say something nice ' about some Southern leader and not feel that is going to lose him the next election . " That is , in our judgment , what is missing at the present time in the ' United States . " Mr. Marshall , who , played a key part in bringing white S and Negro ' leaders together in Birthinghani , also emphasized ' the hnpottance for the entire South of the ' fact that there had ! been bi-racial r discussions in a city with troubled race relations . " The important ' - 'thing " Mr. Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the people down there . " . " For a city like Birmingham , with a history of difficult race relations , to reach a settlement like this after only a few hours of discussion in a ' most tense atmosphere is a tremendous step forward for Birmingham , for Alabama and for the South generally . " The Attorney General gave Mr. Marshall high commendation for his efforts in Birmingham in the week that began when the assistant attorney general flew there last Saturday . Mr. Kennedy said he had talked with the white and the Negro leaders in Birmingham , and it was " the unanimous feeling on both sides that if it had n't been for his Mr. Marshall 's ? efforts and the work that he did the settlement would ' not have been possible . " " We could n't have gotten the people to sit down , " he said , " could n't have gotten the people to exchange their views , could n't have gotten an , agreement  --  and the situation in Birmingham would be far different tonight . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham and our people . " Those familiar with the tense week in Birmingham said today that lack of communication was one of the major problems . Financial and other leaders in the white community had no idea what the Negro demon- , strators really wanted . At first , it was said , the white leaders took the position that the whole episode was the work of " an outside agitator , " the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . But gradually , over last weekend , they came to realize that the Negro community felt it , was the victim of injustice and wanted change . " There was a growing recognition , " one Birmingham leader said , " by a lot of people when they thought about it , that the Negroes : were demanding something that was n't so unreasonable to have a cup of coffee at a lunch counter , to_the get a decent job . " In addition to this greater understanding of the Negro complaints , the financial community began to fear the economic setback that Birmingham would get from a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settlement had not been ? well under way by ' the ' ' Middle of this week , the feeling was that violence was inevitable . It was also believed that Gov . George Wallace , an extreme segregationist ; was about to take Over the city with National Guard troops . The general feeling at the Justice Department today was one of optimisnl , although no one thought that Birmingham was entirely out , of danger .
