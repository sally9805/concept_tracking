When Playwright Neil Simon first married , he and his wife Joan moved into an apartment in a brownstone on East Tenth Street in Manhattan . It was four flights up , plus the additional steps of the front stoop . When deliverymen arrived with the furniture , they collapsed on it and sat there for a quarter of an hour with their mouths open and only the whites of their eyes showing . <P> One piece of furniture was a large single bed . In the Simons ' bedroom , it reached from wall to wall . To get to the closet , they had to walk over the bed . It might have seemed more sensible to sleep in the living room , but there was a skylight there with a considerable hole in it , and , in winter , snow frequently came pouring through . <P> All this sounds more like the start of a successful theatrical comedy than a successful marriage , but it turned out to be both . The marriage has been running ten good years . Neil Simon 's comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long too ; it is the first and only smash of the present Broadway season and is already sold out through February . With Elizabeth Ashley as his spritely wife and Robert Redford as a rough facsimile of himself , the play precisely duplicates the events , rents and blizzards of the Simons ' golden past , with deliverymen reeling into view like sherpas out of shape , and the young couple fighting the plausible battles of youth : <P> He : Let 's discuss it . <P> She : Not with you in the room . <P> Seven Caesars . To be sure , the real situation has been embellished . A mysterious , never-seen downstairs neighbor puts nine empty cans of tuna into the hall each morning . Who could be living there ? Perhaps " a big cat with a can opener . " But most of Neil Simon 's funny lines pass the true test of comedy : out of context , they mean nothing ; they rise from the fabric of incident . <P> At 36 , Simon has become Broadway 's leading comedy writer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ran for 85 weeks , and has now been metamorphosed into a Frank Sinatra movie . Last year , commissioned by Producers Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin to turn Patrick Dennis ' Little Me into a musical , Simon got a brainflash , wrote all seven of the major male roles for Sid Caesar , creating one of the season 's better box-office draws . <P> Knit Fireworks . In his private person , Simon is shy , quiet and inconspicuous . But Walter Mitty would be jealous . He is the man who listens unnoticed as the professional party clowns laugh it up , then-in a momentary gap in the uproar-drops a quiet line that tops them all . " Doc " Simon , as he has been called since he used to compete with physicians in their attempts to diagnose family sicknesses , has been writing jokes since he was in his teens . His father was a dress salesman , and the Simons lived in an apartment in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan . Doc and his older brother Danny were a professional writing team for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comics from Phil Silvers to Jackie Gleason.
