In many a U.S. community , stocky Curtis Bryant , 44 , would be considered a model citizen . A crane operator for the Illinois Central Railroad , he is head of his union local , a Baptist Sunday school teacher and deacon , a Boy Scout committee chairman . But he is also president of his county 's chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People-and that , in McComb , Miss , ( pop . 12,020 ) , can apparently be enough to put a man behind bars . <P> By standards elsewhere , Bryant is far from a militant Negro leader . His 178 N.A.A.C.P. chapter members have dutifully passed the hat to help the national organization , protested unsuccessfully against a few race killings , held a quiet voting drive that only got 250 of Pike County 's 15,400 Negroes to register . Says Bryant : " We have n't gone into any radical area . " <P> Thus Bryant did not encourage five young Negroes when they decided to sit at McComb 's Greyhound and Woolworth lunch counters in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 16 , was treated as an adult and sentenced to eight months in jail , where she spent a month . <P> After her release , Brenda applied for readmission to her tenth-grade class at Burgland High School and was turned away by Principal Commodore Dewey Higgins . Angered , 120 of her schoolmates walked out , assembled at a Negro Masonic hall , and were advised by organizers of the Nashville-based Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee ( who had come to McComb to spur Negro voting ) to march upon city hall . The students filed two abreast to the city hall steps , began to pray-and were all arrested . A white S.N.C.C. leader among them , Robert Zellner , 22 , of Atlanta , was beaten and kicked in the face by white toughs , who were not arrested . Chief of Police George Guy explained : " I did n't see who they were . " <P> To the railroad yards next morning came two McComb policemen to arrest Curtis Bryant . Although he had neither planned nor been present at the students ' march , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delinquency of a minor-Brenda Travis , who was sent to reform school for an indefinite term by Judge Hansford Simmons . <P> Last week FBI agents were checking into Pike County 's brand of justice , Brenda 's classmates were required to sign no-demonstration pledges to get back in school , and two white out-of-state sympathizers were pulled from their car and beaten on McComb 's Summit Street . With surprising candor , two of the county 's top lawmen gave the real reason why N.A.A.C.P. Leader Bryant was jailed . " Bryant puts himself in the class of the white people , " said Sheriff Clyde Simmons . Said Police Chief Guy : " We 're trying to rook him in on the damn thing somewhere . "
