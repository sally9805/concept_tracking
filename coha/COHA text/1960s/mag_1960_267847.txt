A NUMBER OF THINGS ( 248 pp. ) - Honor Tracy-Random House ( $3.95 ) . <P> In this patchy , fast-paced comic novel , Irish-Scottish Honor Tracy emerges as a satirist wielding bludgeon and scalpel in defense of the Establishment-that in domitable , mutual-aid group of clergy , big business and old school ties who rule Britain , no matter who wins the elections . Her hero , a proper and rather priggish young Briton named Henry Lamb , is sent to Trinidad in the West Indies as correspondent of Torch , a lit'ry weekly " that 's going to teach us all to live . " In Trinidad , gushes Torch 's lisping editor , " the dwegs and outcasts of the community now are forging a destiny of their own . Minds wuthlessly depwived for centuwies are finding valid art forms . " <P> In her previous books ( The Straight and Narrow Path , Silk Hats and No Breakfast ) , Author Tracy has savaged Irish clergymen and patriots , Spanish politicians and bureaucrats .

Candida races about the islands with the enraptured but platonic Henry ( her only proviso : " We must not make a baby ! " ) . She involves him in punching a local union leader in the jaw and horsewhipping an editor .

But Author Tracy also shares with Saki a grand and grisly way with a funny anecdote , as when a decorous lawn party belatedly realizes that the West Indian gardener who lopes by is carrying in his hand not a melon , but the severed head of the cook . Before he is carted off to jail , forlorn Henry decides that the contemporary world is one where virtue and vice are " superseded by Good Public Relations and Bad . " Even more catastrophic is his final moment of revelation : " We 're all West Indians . "
