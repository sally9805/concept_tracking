The Country Wife , by William Wycherley . Charles II 's England shared the obsession of its king-it was sex-mad . From that consuming passion sprang the witty , monomaniacally bawdy drama known as Restoration comedy . If Congreve was the age 's greatest theatrical wit , Wycherley ( 1640-1715 ) may well have been its most vigorous social chronicler . He was a rake who later reformed , with all the zealotry that implies . In him , the pagan warred with the Puritan , the scandalizer with the sermonizer , and perhaps never more fiercely than in his most durable play , The Country Wife . <P> The plot is carnally direct . Mr. Horner ( Stacy Keach ) , a notorious London lecher , has it bruited about town through his quack doctor that recent sexual misadventures in France have left him impotent . He rightly guesses that this will give him unlimited access to bored wives and unmatched opportunities to cuckold their husbands . The game is at least as important as the score to Horner , and he especially relishes the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is an innocuous companion . <P> A co-plot might be called Sex and the Country Girl , or how Mrs. Pinch-wife ( Elizabeth Huddle ) is schooled in the sexual duplicities of the big city . The climax is a scene of biting mockery in which Mr. Pinchwife , more jealous jailer than husband , is tricked into delivering his wife , masked , straight to Horner 's seduction headquarters . <P> The satirist in Wycherley never subdued the pornographer , and this bed-drawing-room comedy contains some of the most salaciously funny scenes and speeches known to dramatic literature . But if Wycherley uses , and perhaps abuses , sex to make his point , sex is not his point . His moral intent is to show that ethics are lowest where the prizes are greatest-and sex was the dearest trophy of Restoration society . <P> With its woefully unseasoned actors , its melting-pot English , and its lack of anything resembling ensemble playing , the Lincoln Center Repertory Company is pitiably overmatched by the play . However , no American company would be likely to carry it off successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its surface is its substance . It demands dry , stylized cynicism . By temperament and training , this is alien to the American actor , who almost invariably tries to humanize his role and to bridle the most outrageous farce with the halter of naturalistic plausibility . And Wycherley 's characters can not be played as people , since they are monsters in velvet and lace , transparencies of vice through which the playgoer is meant to view his own . <P> The glacial pace at which Robert Symonds has directed The Country Wife is a further handicap . Speed , as well as brevity , is the soul of wit , and double entendres go best at the double-quick . Tame Wycherley is lame Wycherley-which is precisely what is wrong at Lincoln Center .
