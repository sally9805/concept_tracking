The drab , two-story building on Montevideo 's bustling Boulevard Espaa looks as quiet as a convent . It is hardly that . Inside is the Soviet Union 's biggest embassy in Latin America and the clearinghouse for Soviet propaganda and subversion in the Southern Hemisphere . Up to now , the Uruguayan government has never bothered to interfere . But suddenly last week Uruguay 's ruling nine-man National Council cracked down , ordering four Soviet embassy officers out of the country and serving notice on the others to watch their step . <P> All four , the government claimed , were members of the Soviet intelligence organization , and had helped the country 's Communist Party gain control of Uruguay 's major student and labor groups . Once in control , the Reds had triggered a series of costly and bloody strikes . Last week , after gas , construction and packinghouse workers threatened a whole new round of strikes , the National Council decided that enough was enough and ordered the expulsion .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
