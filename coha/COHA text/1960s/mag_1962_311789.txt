The girls in their summer dresses might well have arrived by bus from Waterloo , Iowa . Some of the boys looked like members of the chorus of West Side Story . Except for the slightly waddling walk that characterizes ballet dancers , few Sunday strollers would recognize them as the youngsters of the Bolshoi on their day off . Every Sunday since they arrived in the U.S. four weeks ago , they have been wandering . happily around New York like a family of prize mallards . <P> All week long they have no time-off at all . Even on tour , the company takes lessons in the morning and rehearses in the afternoon , so a dancer 's day begins at 10 a.m. and ends at 11 p.m. , when the final curtain drops at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House . They lack time-or money-for gaiety . Though in Moscow their salaries are excellent on the Russian scale ( some even have their own cars ) , the corps de ballet dancers are getting only $50 a week in the U.S. , plus rooms and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can not afford to eat in the better restaurants , and they apparently prefer not to eat in people 's restaurants , such as Horn &; Hardart 's .

" If they 're going to be exposed to capitalism , they might as well get it all in one fell swoop , " said Mrs. Kean . No one went hungry at Mrs. Kean 's swoop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire top of the Hotel Westbury like a two-acre astrakhan hat . She had Russian-speaking waiters up there passing champagne and beef Stroganoff on sterling silver platters . She had Henry Fonda , Robert Preston . Jerome Robbins , Gene Kelly . She had jazzman Ted Straeter , with a five-piece band . The young people of the Bolshoi loved every minute of it . When Straeter flooded the place with twist music , members of the corps de ballet were soon writhing to its rhythms . <P> Incredible Pyramids . Last week the Russian dancers took a boat ride around Manhattan Island . They stared in utter disbelief at the vast automobile crematoriums of The Bronx , where the dead cars are piled up beside the Harlem River in unstable pyramids . Almost every dancer has a camera-movie or still . Awed by the triple run of traffic on the Major Deegan Expressway , they hastened to record the incredible sight . A sparkling cabin cruiser roared insolently by . A male dancer asked if it was privately owned . " Yes , " said an interpreter . The dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
