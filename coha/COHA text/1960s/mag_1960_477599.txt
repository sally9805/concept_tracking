The View From the Fortieth Floor is , so far as I know , the second good novel ever written about the magazine business . At least the label on the jacket says it is " A Novel " and an author 's note insists that the characters are " entirely imaginary. - In the weeks following its publication. * these statements may be questioned . A good many critics are likely to argue that it is n't , a novel at all , or anyhow that it does not fit their canonical formula . And people in the magazine business will read it ? with the most intent interest ? as a non-fiction report on the vast upheaval which is now shaking their industry . This is inescapable , since the author , Theodore H. White , was an internationally respected reporter long before he turned to fiction ; he has , in his words , " witnessed from within the collapse of three great publishing enterprises " ; and he was one of the editors of Collier 's during the months of its death struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final catastrophe at Collier 's ? although it is true that his main characters do not much resemble the people involved in that tragedy . What interests me most , however , is not that story , dramatic as it is . The book 's real significance comes from its insights into certain major ( though little noticed ) changes now under way in American society ? and in its foreshadowing of things likely to happen in the field of mass communications . In this respect it might be described as old-fashioned . The novel which examines a broad stretch of the social landscape is rare these days ? much rarer than the introspective novel which tries to probe the depths of a single soul . That *On May 20. by William Sloane Associates ( $4.95 ) . An interesting . earlier novel about magazines and their editors was John Brooks 's Thc Dig Wheel ' . Mr. White does not attempt . The souls of his characters lie pretty close to the surface , and in any case he is more interested in probing the workings of a **32;1648;TOOLONG machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main stream of contemporary fiction . It is carefully plotted , and the action moves fast . It has heroes and villains . It deals with ordinary , recognizable pen-p/c , trying to cope with everyday problems ; none of them are junkies , perverts , beatniks , or psychopaths . It is n't sexed up ; readers who want erotic titillation had better stick to Metalious and O'Hara . Its scene is the business world , where most Americans spend their lives , but which all but a few novelists regard as unworthy of their attention . ( Maybe that is n't quite fair ; perhaps most novelists avoid the business world simply because they do n't know much about it . Mr. White does . His considerable firsthand experience obviously has been backed up by thorough research into the habits , techniques , and mentalities of bankers , liquor manufacturers , printers , lawyers , big-time real-estate men , and that peculiar sub-tribe of businessmen who track down Special Situations . Like MeNillc , Dreiser , and Balza- , but unlike many of his contemporaries , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into getting his facts straight . ) As a reporter , using the tools of fiction , Mr. White has set out to explore two little-understood facts about the magazine business : ( 1 ) The mass-circulation magazines , which reached their peak during the first quarter of this century , began to slide about ten years ago : as a group , they are still slipping , in both profits and influence ; and there is no reason to believe they will ever recover their old place of dominance . ? ( 2 ) Magazines are created by editors ; they die in the hands of businessmen . Mass magazines grew out of a strange combination of circumstances which converged during the final decades of the last century . Those were the years when American industry discovered the techniques of mass production . A factory was 110 longer limited to serving a local market ; it could now turn out enough shirts , or stoves , or soap to supply customers all over the continent . Moreover , the railroad network was completed at about the same time . so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , in the words of one of Mr. White 's characters . " the whole country is one market , you can make one brand image for the whole nation and deliver ? but only if you can find a way of talking to the whole country at once . They need a big horn ... a horn that will reach everybody . " And just at that moment another constellation of events made it possible for imaginative editors to create such a horn . Printers were developing high-speed rotary presses , capable of spinning out millions of copies of a magazine in a few days , The railroads , again , were now ready to deliver them promptly to every village . Public schools were turning out the first mass audience , creating the first nation where practically everybody could read ? at least a little . For those who could n't , including a swelling stream of immigrants , there were pictures ? which now , for the first time in history , could be reproduced cheaply and fast , because somebody had just invented half-tone engraving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of magazine ? MrChtre 's , The Saturday Evening Post , Leslie 's , The Ladies ' Home Journal , Munsey 's , Cosmopolitan , and a few others . They spoke , not to an educated elite , but to the barely literate millions . . . they reached everywhere , as no newspaper could .. . they carried a national message to a people who were beginning to feel the heady emotions of a new nationalism . At last the advertisers had their Big Horn ; and they used it , to the enormous profit of themselves and the magazines , to create the first nation-wide system of mass marketing . To run such a magazine , it was necessary ( as Mr. White says ) " to invent a new kind of person . " " It was the first time anybody except the President of the United States had to sit in an office and think about this whole damned country all at once . Some editor had to think not just what the local people in Chicago , or New York . or Charleston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hold an audience together across the whole land , from coast to coast . The first time somebody sat in this kind of office in New York and started to play with the mind of the country , things started to happen .. .. " For the past fifty years anything this country has done , the magazines kicked them into doing the magazines closed up the trusts , cleaned up something less than 3 per cent last year ? an ominous showing , in comparison with TV and with most other industries . Meanwhile , magazines of a differ-em type have been flourishing . These are the so-called special-audience publications . They make no effort to reach a mass readership , and therefore compete neither with TV nor the big-circulation magazines . Instead each of them speaks to its own small , well-defined group ? an intellectual elite of one kind or another . One example is Scientific American , perhaps the most spectacular success in postwar publishing . Its circulation totals only 245,000 , a microscopic figure compared with the more than six million of Life and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group which is climbing fast in influence , prestige , and income . Another example is The New Yorker , which now carries more pages of advertising than any other magazine ( except a few technical journals ) because it is edited expressly for an audience far above the average in sophistication , taste , and wealth . Other such publications arc Fortune . Harper 's , Holiday , The Saiardery Review , The Atlantic Monthly , Forbes , and a handful more : they differ widely in content and character , but they all have two things in common : ( 1 ) a readership which is relatively small , well-educated , well-off , and devoted ; ( 2 ) a steadily rising volume of advertising . The last fact is easy to explain . II ' you want to sell something that has . at most , a half-million potential buyers ? a turbine , a fine wine , a sports car , a Mediterranean cruise . an idea , a new fashion , a hand-tailored investment program ? it would be silly for you to advertise it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture-thumbers . For your purposes , such an audience is mostly irrelevant ? perhaps entirely so , since the man who is able to buy these things is n't likely to waste much time looking at pictures . He is more apt to spend his scanty leisure in reading Fortune or one of the other special-interest magazines ? and he can be reached there at a fraction of the cost . Furthermore , if you can influence time influence a much wider circle . For they are the tastemakers and opinion formers ? the one per cent of the population , roughly , who are imitated by the others who hold the leadership posts in business and government .. . who can articulate their views forcefully enough to command respect . To cite a minor instance . when they began to drive small foreign cars they set a fashion which eventually forced Detroit ( much against its will ) to change its whole scheme of design , production , and sales . Another paradox ( the industry seems to be full of them ) is that the specialized publications , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the mass-circulation magazines , and at far less cost . The reason is that our society , in its growing complexity , needs more and more educated people to keep it running . As our universities turn them out , they also produce , inevitably , a growing public which is dissatisfied with the bland banalities of the mass media . Nevertheless , it is improbable that the special-audience magazines will ever try to reach more than about one per cent of the population . To do so would mean a fundamental change of character ; and , since this is the last thing they want , some of them already ' are restricting their circulation . T H E central character in The f'ir 'm From the Fortieth Floor is Ridge Warren , a professional executive who has just become president of a sick publishing company . The board of directors hired him to do two things : raise a lot of new capital , and revive its two money-losing magazines . ( Presumably it is only coincidence if they bear any resemblance to Collier 's and The Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pale mauve in the years before their death . ) Warren 's first move is to " en , gineer an audience "  - -  - to build back circulation by a series of editorial gimmicks and expensive promotion stunts . He succeeds , but in the process he destroys the last remnants of the magazines ' character . Because the audience lie collects is non- THE EASY CHAIR eluding the advertisers ) has any confidence in them ; because Warren never has time to figure out what he wants to say to his audience , nobody can tell what his magazines stand for . The trouble is that Warren is a businessman , working for a board of businessmen . They think of their magazines not as a Voice but as a Property . None of them has any real interest in editorial content , or any understanding of the man who created the magazines in the first place . That was old Ab Pepper , an editor . He never had any doubt what he wanted to say , and the most important thing in his life was to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , because he was saying important ( though often unpopular ) things ? because he believed that one man plus the truth makes a majority , " because he thought he was responsible not just to his stockholders but to the country . So he made his magazines a power in American life , and incidentally made money . When he died his publications passed into the hands of trustees , to whom making money was by no means incidental . As businessmen , they had been trained to put that first : to them , the Old Man 's passion for shouting the truth as he saw it was just an embarrassing eccentricity . The Voice grew hoarse , the audience drifted away , and ( though the trustees never glimpsed the connection ) the money drifted with it . Because Warren , a nice honest guy , had all the right instincts except those of an editor , there really was n't anything he could do to save the property . This part of Mr. White 's story sums up the history of many maga-zines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All great publica-tions have been created by great editors . The classic case is The Saturday Everting Post , a sorry starveling when George Horace Lorimer took charge in 1899 . He built it into the world 's biggest weekly , by making it the authentic spokesman of America 's middle class . At about the same time Norman Hapgood was making Collier 's the crusading leader of the reform move-ment which culminated in the ministrations . A generation later . Henry Luce , who still thinks of himself primarily as an editor , started Time on a shoestring and pyramided it into the most powerful of today 's magazine empires ; and DeWitt Wallace accomplished a similar feat with The Reader 's Digest . The same thing is true of the great newspapers . All of them were the products of editorial minds ? Dana , Pulitzer , Ochs , Scripps , McCormick , Cowles , White , Daniels , and a score of others . When the founders died and the business office took over , many of these papers withered . William Randolph Hearst , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond question ; when it flickered out , his papers became The Property which they are today , respectable and juiceless . So too with McCormick 's Chicago Tribune and most of the Scripps relics ? while Dana 's Sun and Pulitzer 's World and many another old-time giant have simply disappeared . MOST of the great editors were also passable businessmen , but that was not their primary role . All of them understood the absolute necessity of keeping editorial and business matters in water-tight compartments . Old E. W. Scripps once threw out of his office a merchant who came to ask an editorial favor ? threw him 50 hard he bounced , anti threw his ads out of the paper to boot . And one of the most durable legends about Harold Ross is that he never let an advertising man set foot on The New Yorker 's editorial floor . Such behavior would have seemed ludicrous to the well-meaning characters in Mr. White 's novel ; they understand the decorum expected of a sound businessman . What they never do understand is that they are attempting something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a publication is no business for a businessman . This , I think , is the main point Mr. White is trying to make about today 's mass magazines . Those which are dominated by purely business interests may well sink into deeper trouble ; while those which are guided by capable editorial minds ? by men who have something to say beyond what TV can offer ? will have the best rhanep for survival .
