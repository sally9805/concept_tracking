Atlanta prides itself on being a city of culture as well as wealth , and last October it put its most prestigious culture under one $13 million roof : the Atlanta Memorial Arts Center. * The big glass and concrete structure on Peachtree Street was hailed as the only one of the nation 's arts centers to house res ident companies in repertory theater , opera , ballet and symphony - as well as an art museum , and an art library and school . <P> Last week , just 100 days after the Memorial Center 's dedication , Atlantans were shocked to hear that the ballet , opera and dramatic repertory were folding . Their parent , Atlanta Municipal Theater , had already run up a deficit of $300,000 and could continue no longer at the center .

Theater should be part of their lives . " <P> Apparently that idea has not caught on in Atlanta . As matters now stand , unless Atlanta 's citizens come forward with a big , overall subsidy , the opera , ballet and repertory theater will have to operate independently , scrambling in an every-man-for-himself competition for funds . In that case , the ballet and theater face severe difficulties .
