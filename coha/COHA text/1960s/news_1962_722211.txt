LEVER KATHERINE LEVER.EVA MORREALE ... pg . 33 Comments on Shelters Responsibility to Live TOTHE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Arthur Krock 's Jan. 2 column is based on false accusations and evasions . He condemns the Defense Department pamphlet for failing to provide means of attaining goals it is without power to attain . He implies that any person who by virtue of geographical and financial circumstance takes the opporttmity to safeguard himself and his family is immoral and degraded and " takes comfort " in his " luck . " He concludes that " * * the only adequate and impartial shelter from nuclear attack is a military and economic power no enemy will dare to invoke . " Mr. Krock , like others who take his position , refuses to unequivocally answer the question , " Is a nuclearI holocaust now possible , " This refusal allows him to identify measures which are rightly taken for the prevention of such an event with measures which should be taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible . This country is fully engaged in an attempt to negotiate nuclear disarmament , and possesses sufficient military power to intimidate any aggressor . But from Mr. Krock one gathers that , should these preventive measures fail . the only moral and courageous alternative is mass suicide . Those who agree with Mr. Krock are evidently making a confused application of the old  --  and correct ? doctrine of Socrates : that without goodness life is not worth living . By the same misapplication of this principle one would have to conclude that all those in our history for whom life was nothing but a painful struggle against circumstance , from caveman to Nazi-hunted Jew , should promptly make an end of it . But that is a doctrine for those who lack the courage and the sense of responsibility that form the very core of our civilization . I am far from wishing to argue as to who would be most fortunate in the event of a nuclear war : the dead or the living . That is a problem for utilitarians . However , the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civilization will realize that goodness can be attained only in and through life . Shamed and penitent as such a person might be , he will not feel degraded at the necessity for " burrowing in the ground . " To be sure , this person finds himself in extraordinary company . Those who patronize department store shelter departments would also emerge , " earth-born , " with him , But therefore all the more reason for restraint , for more thought and less careless talk . It is possible that for many , in the future , life will be bitter and unrewarding . What can one say who is willing to take that possibility into account , except " be prepared " ? JOHN A. BRENTIANGER , Assistant in Instruction , Yale University . New Haven , Conn. , Jan. 2 , 1962 . Cooperating for Peace To T 11 E EDITon OF TII ENEW YOU : TIMES : We all approved very much the column of Arthur Krock on shelters in the Jan. 2 Times except the last sentence . It should have read , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futile preparation for the survival of an atomic war but should concentrate all our energies on achieving perpetual peace through intelligent cooperation with the other nations . " JOHN H. LEVER . Coat M. LEVER KATII ERI E LEVER . Brattleboro , Vt. , Jan. 2 , 1962 . War as Alternative Rejected TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I would like to protest against your Jan. 7 editorial on fall-out shelters which does what so many proponents of shelters do : distorts reality by concealing facts . The facts are that in New York State alone practically every city and town of any importance is a target area  --  may I refer you to the list of target areas published some time ago in your paper ? This means that the problem is not fall-out protection but atomic blast and fires . Surely it is not a misconception that there is no adequate protection at this point against either ? By focusing attention on fall-out you induce the vast majority of the residents of New York State to believe that this is the only danger facing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that support of a fallout program in no . vay hampers an effective foreign policy . But a sensible foreign policy must be based on the premise that war simply is never an alternative . That premise is difficult to achieve with a fall-out shelter program in the background ? for the fall-out shelter program is a negation of the premise . As to the conditioning effect of a fall-out program  --  you are quite right that the same argument applies to all armaments . For that very reason what we need is commitment to total disarmament , not commitment to fall-out shelters . The cause of world peace  --  and the safety and welfare of New York State residents ( and those in almost all other states of the Union ) would have been far more advanced had the $100 million appropriated to a shelter program been given to the U. N. Eva MORREALE . New York , Jan. 7 , 1962 . Realities of War TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I can not help but comment on your Jan. 7 editorial discussing shelters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of terror under which we now exist . I see only one benefit that may result from this sudden fervor over fall-out : that the realities of war in the nuclear age will be brought home to more people . For it is already clear to many that , since we simply can not build shelters against blast and fire ( except at inconceivable cost ) , most of our population will perish in any full-scale nuclear war . Thus the absurdity of wasting our time with preparations for a few possible survivors , rather than using all our strength and ingenuity in seeking an alternative to the arms race that is now almost beyond control , may soon become apparent to a large majority . If it does not , any who would save their own skins should leave for a remote corner of the earth , rather than burrow in their own back yards under the illusion that they will be the lucky ones who escape the major effects of the nuclear bombs . We who now believe in Gandhi 's methods consider that the use of violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men must learn to settle international conflicts through nonviolent techniques , where diplomacy fails . This does not , of course , mean nonresistance to evil , and it is not an easy way : but it is far more promising than the path of terror We are now following . ROGER FRANKLIN . Putney , Vt. , ? Jan. 7 , 1962 . Shelter Building Called Defeatist To ill E EDITOR Or Tit E ** YORK Timbai : I am deeply disturbed by your editorial approval of Federal and state programs for the building of fall-out shelters ! In the first place , the building of fall-out shelters would not be a defense measure in the category of " any and all other defense measures . " It can not be denied that the building of shelters would prepare most people for war , where they were not prepared before , and would make war more plausible , when it was once a remote and implausible possibility . I am not suggesting that we blind ourselves to the possibility of war . I am suggesting that we face it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructive and dignified peace . Take the $700 million proposed by the Federal Government for the building of shelters and use it for an imaginative , refreshing purpose . That is the Nvay to peace . To reduce the matter to its simple : ; t terms : the building of Ishelter ; would he defeatist . This is he element that you and others who support the building of shelters overlook , and , may I say , at your ! own peril . STEPHEN Coil Brooklyn , Jan. 1962 . Program Called Immoral TOT HE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your Jan. 7 editorial lists as " Misconception No. 4 " this argument : " That if we equip ourselves with some form of protection against fall-out we will thereby condition ourselves more readily to the use of atomic weapons . " You state that " only the believer in a Gandhian policy of nonresistance could consistently take this position . " May I point out that you ignore the context in which the shelter program was first proposed by President Kennedy . In the attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate about Berlin , the Administration sought to establish " nuclear credibility , " to use the term made popular by Senator Margaret Chase Smith . The shelter program was part of the militant ( posture designed to convince the world that nuclear war would not deter us from fulfilling that which we consider to be our national purpose in Berlin . It is this context that makes the program so inherently immoral . The hope of the world depends on maintaining the conviction and posture ' of " nuclear incredibility " on both sides of the Iron Curtain . As a clergyman . I can not conceive - of any greater sin for our nation than to promote any program , no matter how wise , which tends to build up " nuclear credibility . " ( Rabbi ) JACOB B. AGES .
