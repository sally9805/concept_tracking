Just as loquacious as Marguerite Oswald was Jack Ruby , who appeared in court in an effort to get his forthcoming trial moved out of Dallas . <P> Ruby told reporters that he has been reading the Bible ( " The truth has come to me during incarceration " ) and delivered a disjointed discourse on the meaning of patriotism and hatred : " I think after being incarcerated as long as I have , I know that most people do n't know how small is the minority of people in the world who create hatred . They are the cancer on our free society . So many of our great people have been hurt by them . <P> " I am not frightened . I am a Godfearing man , but who would n't have difficulty in my situation ? I know that I face a serious charge . I am a 100% American who loves his country . I love my President . I have intestinal fortitude . I want to do so much for democracy . . . " When photographers yelled , " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruby replied , " That 's right , I 'm Jack , I 'm Jack . " But at another point , he admonished the photographers : " Instead of yelling , ' Jack , Jack , ' say , ' Mr. Ruby , turn this way , ' and I 'll be happy to . " <P> Acrimony . Despite all Ruby 's efforts to gain attention , it was really a lawyers ' week in Judge Joe Brown 's small courtroom . Chief Defense Attorney Melvin Belli and his assistant , Texas Lawyer Joe Tonahill , subpoenaed more than 150 witnesses to help prove the defense contention that Ruby can not get a fair trial in Dallas . Belli brought only 41 of them to the stand . Most of them agreed that it would be difficult to find twelve unprejudiced men for a jury ; but then again , they thought it would be possible . Department Store Operator Stanley Marcus , for one , thought it would be " more likely " that Ruby would get a fair trial somewhere else but under cross-examination admitted that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belli had an acrimonious confrontation with Dallas Public Relations Man Sam Bloom , who has taken on the job of handling technical arrangements for the trial , including issuance of press credentials . During one exchange , Bloom snapped : " Do n't bark at me , Mr. Belli . " Cried Belli : " Do n't smile at me , Mr. Bloom . " Belli kept trying to make Bloom admit that Dallasites really wanted to try Ruby in their city , convict him , and thereby get rid of some sort of guilt complex . But Bloom was insistent : " I do n't think Dallas has any sins . " <P> Invitation to Insult . At last , Judge Brown handed down a decision that was at best indecisive . He ordered attorneys to begin this week to select a jury . The questioning of prospective jurors , said Brown , " is the true test of whether this trial should be changed to another city . " If an impartial panel can not be selected , he might then order a change of venue . <P> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We are going to do everything this side of insulting a prospective juror in order to determine if they do or do not have a conscious or unconscious prejudice .
