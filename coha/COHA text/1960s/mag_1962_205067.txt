Thirty-one years ago , when California 's Richfield Oil Co. collapsed from reckless overexpansion and feckless management , giants scrambled for the pieces . Among the contenders was the late Harry Ford Sinclair , who hustled in from the east in his company Fokker to announce : " Gentlemen , I am in California and I am in to stay . " <P> Sinclair stayed long enough to pluck Richfield out of the expectant hands of Standard Oil of California . Unable to outbid SoCal by himself , he teamed up with Manhattan 's Cities Service Co. ; between them , the two eastern oil companies and their subsidiaries eventually bought up 62% of the stock in the reorganized Richfield Oil Corp . Last week . 26 years after the deal went through , the Justice Department hauled Richfield . Cities Service and Sinclair Oil into Los Angeles federal court to answer a civil suit alleging violation of the antitrust laws . <P> Prime reason for the trustbusters ' belated move was a suspicion that the three companies had an unwritten agreement on marketing areas . Richfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , has 4,600 service stations in California , Oregon , Washington , Utah , Idaho , Nevada and Arizona , and controls about 10% of the gasoline market in those states . But never since it came out of bankruptcy has it tried to spread eastward again . Similarly , Sinclair ( the nation 's ninth largest oil company ) and Cities Service ( tenth ) have stayed out of western markets almost entirely on the avowed ground that the costs of pipelining gas and oil over the Rockies would be prohibitive . Along with this lack of direct competition , the Government also objects to the fact that Richfield 's 13-man board of directors includes three Cities Service officers ( Chairman Burl S. <P> Watson . President J. Edwin Warren , General Counsel Henry L. O'Brien ) and two Sinclair officers ( Chairman Percy C. Spencer . President Edward L. Steiniger ) . <P> In its suit , the Government sought no fines or jail sentences for the defendants , who included the five interlocking directors as well as the companies . Instead , the Justice Department hoped only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock and surrender their seats on the Richfield board . But the defendants , who denied any conspiracy , pointed out that their arrangement had been specifically approved by a federal court in 1936.
