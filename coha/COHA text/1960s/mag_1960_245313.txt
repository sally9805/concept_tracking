Today 's civil engineer can build a bridge , but what else can he do ? In an age when technological breakthroughs occur almost overnight , many U.S. educators fear that engineering courses have become so specialized and formula-bound that they contain the seeds of their own obsolescence . Last week Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that it is revamping its civil engineering curriculum to roll with the future . <P> It is not enough , says M.I.T. 's Dean of Engineering Gordon S. Brown , to try to match technological advances by adding a new course here , another there : " This produces a hodgepodge , a Christmas tree that you keep adding lights to , never quite being able to keep pace with the changes that are taking place all the time . " <P> M.I.T. 's new plan is a systems approach , which is spreading throughout its engineering departments in a $9,275,000 overhaul financed by the Ford Foundation . On the premise that specialized skills can be learned on the job after graduation , M.I.T. 's civil engineering students will take courses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , operations research and computer development . They will also study social and political factors that influence engineering applications . Says M.I.T. 's Dr. John Wilbur : " All the structures , ground facilities and processes that adapt and control environment are the concern of the civil engineer . " <P> Last week M.I.T. 's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics was missing one of its wind tunnels . Materials-testing machines have disappeared from the Department of Mechanical Engineering . Explains M.I.T. 's President Julius A. Stratton : " The use of big commercial equipment suitable for stereotyped experiments is yielding to more imaginative approaches in which students are given an opportunity to undertake projects of their choice , and to benefit by a kind of internship under the guidance of a faculty member .
