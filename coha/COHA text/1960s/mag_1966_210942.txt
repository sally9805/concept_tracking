All the outlanders love to laugh about how fouled up New York City is , - and rarely has the laughter been louder than during last January 's transit strike . Since then a lot of cities across the nation have discovered that strikes by public employees-which Franklin D. Roosevelt once described as " unthinkable and intolerable " - are no laughing matter . <P> Demanding that their in-station hours be cut from 56 to 50 a week , 278 of Kansas City 's firemen last month got around state laws by playing sick for four days ; in so doing they defied a court injunction and created a wrangle so bitter that National Guardsmen were sent to guard firehouses . In Atlanta , 500 of 726 firemen quit their own union , the International Association of Fire Fighters , which bars strikes , then walked out for 21 days despite a court back-to-work order . <P> <P> In Michigan , which has had more public strikes ( 15 ) in the past twelve months than in 17 previous years , 250 Lansing workers recently won pay hikes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down everything but the city 's golf courses and graveyards . Garbage men have been on strike in Dayton and Youngstown , Ohio , and in Louisville , where one militant leader last week promised to hold out " until the garbage backs up to the heavens . " Around Detroit and Los , Angeles , teachers and welfare workers have joined the parade . <P> Amid all this , no union has been more aggressive than the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ' s 300,000-man American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , whose membership , ranging from clerks to cops , has grown 66% since 1960 . According to Union President Jerry Wurf , 47 , more city officials had better be ready to go to the bargaining tables-and then to their treasuries . Public workers , he says happily , " are willing to take nothing less than parity with their industry peers . "
