THERE is no longer much question that cigarette smoking is a hazard to health ; the medical evidence is overwhelming . The real debate now centers on what to do about it . That debate involves some fundamental issues , and they affect not only an industry that likes to call itself the nation 's oldest-tobacco-but also several other major lines of business , notably advertising and broadcasting . More basically , the issues go to the heart of the concept of freedom at a time when personal freedoms are being expanded . <P> Should an industry be at liberty to promote a product that 70 million U.S. smokers want , even if it endangers life ? What is the responsibility of the cigarette makers to the public ? And what restrictive actions , if any , should the Government take against them ? These questions are crucial in the growing controversy over cigarette smoking and selling . <P> A Confrontation <P> Last week the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee opened hearings aimed at providing some of the answers . Congress will need the answers soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban cigarette advertising on radio and television , which it regulates , but it needs congressional approval to enforce such an act . The Federal Trade Commission wants to strengthen the current ineffectual warning on cigarette packs , which now reads <P> Caution : Cigarette Smoking May Be <P> Hazardous to Your Health . <P> If the FCC has its way , the new label will be <P> Warning : Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Health and May Cause Death from Cancer and Other Diseases . <P> <P> Both the FTC and the FCC also urge that this warning be appended to all cigarette advertisements and commercials . This week Joseph L. Cullman III , chairman of Philip Morris Inc. , will testify for the nine companies that make U.S. cigarettes . He plans to say that , should the mandatory warnings be extended to all ads , the industry will abandon advertising entirely . <P> Why do critics go after cigarette advertising rather than attempt to outlaw the product itself ? In practical terms , any sort of Volstead-style prohibition of cigarettes would be impossible to legislate , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral and legal questions involved , the anti-tobacco forces consider a drive on marketing to be the best way to confront the cigarette . <P> The federal regulatory commissions would have the power to do what they want without congressional approval if Congress had not passed a cigarette-labeling act in 1965 , which obliged cigarette companies to put the current warning sign on all packages . As a concession to legislators from the tobacco-growing Southeast , a clause was added that specifically " preempted " for Congress the right to rule on cigarette advertising . That was a lucky stroke for the industry , which has been shielded from further action not only on the part of federal agencies but also by a number of state legislatures where antitobacco bills are now pending . The preemption clause will expire on June 30 , however , and Congress must then decide where to go from there .
