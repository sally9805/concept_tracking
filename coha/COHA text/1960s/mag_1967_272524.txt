It was one of the most extraordinary scenes ever staged at Orly airport . At 4 a.m. , almost all the members of the French Cabinet lined up like an honor guard to greet Charles de Gaulle . They had hardly expected the predawn arrival ; but then , they had hardly expected their President to stir up such a fuss in Canada that he would have to take French leave and hurry home . <P> A few days later , the same cast of characters took part in one of the most extraordinary Cabinet meetings in French history . Such eminent scholars as Novelist Andre Malraux , Law Professor Edgar Faure and Poetry Anthologist Georges Pompidou had to sit in solemn silence while the general delivered himself of his peculiarly Gallic version of Canadian history . <P> Wistful Pride . France had founded Canada , said De Gaulle , and " alone for 21 centuries had administered , populated and developed " the country . After the English conquest came " a century of oppression . " Now , in the second century of British rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own country of liberty , equality and fraternity . " <P> What would France do about it ? She would help the Canadians " to achieve the liberationist aims that they have set for themselves . " She would " organize and extend more and more her ties with the French people of Canada . " De Gaulle stopped just short of announcing the annexation of Quebec-for the present , anyway . He grandly proclaimed that France has no pretensions to sovereignty " over all or part of the Canada of today . " <P> His statement made it clear that De Gaulle was not about to apologize to his Canadian hosts or even appear contrite for the clamor he raised with his call for a Quebec libre . Well aware that his new statement would only keep the hassle alive , he said with a kind of wistful pride : " It 's always been like that . " Lest any of his ministers had forgotten , he then recalled the brouhahas of other days-from his refusal to meet F.D.R. after the Yalta Conference in 1945 to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , refused to think of the incident in such grandiose terms . Prime Minister Lester Pearson simply reiterated his statement that the French meddling was " unacceptable , " indicating that he can use a euphemism with deadly effect . <P> " Get Out Fast ! " The French press showed far less restraint . " Get out , get out fast , general ! " demanded the weekly Minute , which went on to suggest that it might be time to invoke the constitutional provision that calls for the replacement of the French President when he becomes " disabled . " The magazine also ran a full-page cartoon that pictured De Gaulle gagged and sputtering , his arms pinned back by two gorillas , who are getting instructions from Premier Georges Pompidou : " You can let him shake hands . But above all , keep him from talking , no matter what ! "
