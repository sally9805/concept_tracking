Notes and Comment THE shy neutrino has always been one of our favorite atomic particles . Weightless , and bearing no electrical charge whatever , it rarely reacts with anything in its busy microcosm . In fact , we have never been quite sure how scientists got into contact with the neutrino in the first place , but some things must he taken on faith . Now a scientist with impressive Yale and N.A.S.A . credentials has propounded the theory that the neutrino lies at the foundation of our entire universe of matter and energy , and will outlast it . It may he , the Times recently quoted him as saying , that " from the neutrino we came and to the neutrino we will return . " With all respect to the diffident neutrino , we must take exception to this revision of Genesis 3 : 19 . If we have to acknowledge our transience here ( and who would presume to doubt it ? ) , we far prefer the original version . Rather than believe that we will vanish into utter neutrinal oblivion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the grains of unsweepable sand in the corner of an abandoned summer house . THE great and restful beauty of the newspapers is , of course , their predictability . All the alarming novelty of the world is expressed in phrases one has often read before , and one greets as an old friend the cartoon dove called Peace who perches on the very mouth of the great black cannon inscribed with the crisis of the moment . This soothing familiarity is never so apparent , and never so welcome , as on a Sunday morning . With utterly untrembling fingers , one turns the pages of , say , the Times Magazine to " Israel , Fourteen Years After Independence , " or " Africa , a Sleeping Giant Stirs , " or " Israel , Fourteen Years and Three Months After Independence . " One sleepily reads and sleepily relishes . One knows where one is . One has been there before . A Sunday or two ago , however , we received a nasty shock as we made our way through " The Forum " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equanimity , a " Stamp News " headline to the effect that an Indonesia Dance Issue was Out , we turned to an item tided , with deceptive familiarity , " Barnacles on the City Schools . " It began with an epigraph : It shall he unlawful for a schoolhouse to be constructed in the City of New York without an open-air playground attached to or used in connection with the same . ? State Education Law , Section 2556 , Subdivision 5 . " This prohibition , " observed Miss Terry Ferrer , the writer of the piece , " is one of the countless barnacles which have attached themselves to the weedy hull of the New York City school system over the years . This particular section , passed by the Legislature in 1895 , has been widely and openly violated in the city , where some schocils do not have any playground , let alone one in the open air . " Despite a faint misgiving at the peculiar language used , we confidently awaited the author 's indignation at this flouting of a beneficent law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , to the complete annihilation of our Sunday calm , she went on to note , with evident approval , a move afoot in the state legislature whose purpose was to " scrape off these useless legal accumulations . " Here is news indeed . As we understand the matter , an old law requiring playgrounds for schoolchildren is to be abolished because it has not been obeyed . When one 's initial surprise wears off , one can see that the argument is logical enough ; if there is no law , obviously there can be no difficulty about lawbreakers . But why should this dazzling new juridical no-non be applied only to corporate organs , like the Board of Education ? Fair shares for all , we say . It can he argued , with equal vehemence and equal point , that parents who earnestly want their children to enjoy the benefits of a school playground should not he prosecuted for dynamiting any buildings that interfere with the necessary open space . In fact , the whole situation might result in a fruitful new formulation of Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our shattered Sunday to the task , with , we believe , some little success . " I care not who makes a country 's laws , " runs our amended credo , " so long as I need not obey them . " Bars TPS always pleasant when we get a - A-  chance to eat what we 're writing about , and it 's particularly pleasant when our topic is one that gratifies our sweet tooth . We had that kind of good fortune last spring , when we visited the Good Humor Corporation 's plant in Brooklyn , and now we 've had another confectionary ramble to the city 's outskirts  --  this time to the American headquarters of the Nestle Company , in White Plains . In addition to such products as Nescafe , Instant Nestea , and Major Grey 's Chutney , the firm has been putting out a line of five chocolate bars , and when we learned that it had just issued a sixth bar , the Triple Decker , and that two more , the Butter Crisp and the Cream Bar , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth looking into . Accordingly , we presented ourself at the office of Mr. Clinton Shepperd , assistant to the president , and asked him to unveil  --  or unwrap  --  some prototype bars for us and , incidentally , fill us in on the big chocolate picture . Mr. Shepperd , a tall , gray-haired , and ( for somebody in the chocolate business ) unusually spare man , obligingly told us that chocolate derives from a New World bean , the cacao . Columbus took some cacao beans back to the court of King Ferdinand , but the uses of cacao were not properly appreciated by Europe until 1519 , when Cortes sipped chocolatl , the Aztec royal drink , with Montezuma . Chocolate quickly became an aristocratic drink in Spain , and the method of its preparation was kept a secret for a hundred years . In 1657 , the first chocolate house opened in England . The first North American chocolate factory ( discounting any Aztec enterprises ) opened in New England in 1765 . Nestle 's , Mr. Shepperd went on , began as a maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland , in 1867 , next door to a chocolate factory owned by a man named Daniel Peter . Probably as the result of an overthe-fence conversation between two workmen , someone blended Nestle 's milk with Peter 's chocolate , producing the world 's first milk chocolate . Nestle 's eventually merged with Peter 's and went into the milk-chocolate business , and today , with its headquarters still in Vevey , it is the fifth-largest industrial firm outside the United States ; it has branches in thirty-five countries . The American branch , said Mr. Shepperd , adding the final brushstroke to the big picture , was incorporated in 1912 . " We receive about a hundred and fifty new types of Nestle bars every year , from Nestle firms all over the world , for consideration as possible new products to bring out in this country , " Mr. Shepperd continued . " Of course , most of them are suitable only for the countries where they originated , but every now and then we find one that works here . " ? Vith that , he led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of apotheosis of the cacao bean , and into the office of Mr. Edward A. Taylor , manager of the New Products Department . Mr. Taylor , fortyish and of ( for somebody in the chocolate business ) average girth , was shaking his head over several dozen colorfully wrapped bars set out on a table . " The Germans have just sent a mocha-andrum bar I would n't dare try out here , " he said . " Americans do n't like alcohol flavoring in their chocolate . In Europe , chocolate bars are an experience to share with your friends . Here , they 're something you wolf down or give to Johnny to keep him quiet . Europeans are more venturesome with chocolate . " We asked for a rundown of the tastes of different countries . " The English like a sweet chocolate  --  ton sweet by our standards , " Mr. Taylor began . " The Swiss like a firmer , smoother , creamier texture than we do . Some Americans feel that Swiss chocolate coats the inside of the mouth . The Swiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering taste . " He shucked a Swiss tripleheader for us , called a Cailler ( a Nestle trade name ) Mangalor and identified on the wrapper as " Milch.cchokoladr gefiiitt mit Mandelcreme , Krakant , Haselnusscreme , " and directed us to eat a Haselmisscreme section . We complied with alacrity . " The Belgians are much like the Swiss , but their hars have a sharper , more pungent taste , " he went on . " You can always tell a Belgian bar , " interjected Mr. Shepperd , munching on One . " Of course , some countries are too experimental , " Mr. Taylor resumed . " South Africa , for instance , has come up with Nestle 's Pink-O-Bar . It has a taffy center and a pink chocolate coating . It would never make the grade here , and probably not in any European country , either . " " Our three new bars are all adaptations of foreign bars , " Mr. Shepperd said . " We do n't put foreign bars out the way they come to us ; we work them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for this purpose may turn out as many as a hundred and twenty models of a new bar before we hit on the right one . " " South Africa provided the basis for our new Butter Crisp Bar , " Mr. Taylor said , making up for his remarks about the Pink-O-Bar . " They sent along their Nestle 's Butter Crunch , which had a mixture of chopped hazelnuts , sugar , and butter distributed through a chocolate mass . We suhstitated our own chocolate and tried out forty or fifty different formulations . We had to change the hazelnuts to peanuts  --  hazelnuts do n't go over here  --  before we finally got the bar we wanted . Our new Nestle Cream Bars were derived in similar fashion from a Swiss bar . The easiest to adapt was the new Triple Decker Bar , which we borrowed from our English firm . All we changed was the chocolate . " " Other countries borrow from us a good deal , too , " said Mr. Shepperd , licking a chocolaty finger . " For instance , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken over by South Africa , Australia , and several other countries . " He started in on a Bang , a bar from England . " A very good bar , though I think the name is undignified , " he said . " We do a lot of eating here , " : 14r . Taylor said . " Fortunately , chocolate is good for you . Lindbergh carried chocolate bars aboard the Spirit of St. Louis , and Hillary toted several Nestle products up Mount Everest .

I think you 're the first person to enjoy a trip with me in your group . Sincerely yours , SANDY Project 9 THE police of the Ninth Precinct are to be congratulated on making use of what we believe to be a brand-new weapon in keeping the peace  --  a newsletter . Over the past several weeks , patrolmen throughout the area have distributed , free of charge and with the assistance of food stores and civic groups , fifty thousand copies of the first issue of a four-page English-Spanish publication bearing the no-nonsense title of Ninth Precinct Newsletter . Its purpose is , of course , to improve the rapport between the police and some of the more volatile citizens of the area , which has long been rather shaky . Among the three or four so-called problem precincts in the city , the Ninth is exceptional in having undertaken a long-range crime-prevention program , of which the newsletter is at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also exceptional in its difficulties , which have been piling up for at least a century . Approximately a mile square and containing something over a hundred thousand people , the Ninth , which has been rather prankishly christened " the upper lower East Side , " is bounded by Fourteenth Street , on the north ; Houston Street , on the south ; Broadway , on the west ; and the East River , on the , naturally , east . It is a district of aging tenements , cracked pavements , and tittered streets , into which is jammed one of the most heterogeneous collections of ethnic groups to be found anywhere on earth . From one generation to the next , it has served as the first American home of perhaps a million immigrants  --  Irish , Germans , Italians , and Chine-se before the turn of the century , and Poles , Russians , Rumanians , and Serbians in the early nineteen-hundreds . In recent years , as the older stocks have died or moved away , their places have been taken by Negroes and Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have moved east from Greenwich Village in pursuit of low rents . This group is harmless ; the threat of trouble comes from the Puerto Ricans  --  some thirty thousand of them  --  who now live in the Ninth , and many of whom speak little or no English and traditionally regard all policemen as their enemies . Although the teen-age gangs in the Ninth  --  there arc four major ones , known as the Untouchables , the Young Knights , the Dragons , and the Sportsmen  --  have been kept pretty well under control , the neighborhood erupted into violence last summer often enough to worry both the police and the Lower East Side Neighborhood Association , the latter being a group of social agencies , called LENA for short , that is working to develop a sense of community spirit among the local residents , who arc notoriously suspicious of all " foreigners " except themselves . Stones , roof tiles , and bottles mysteriously rained down off tenement roofs , injuring a couple of patrolmen and on one occasion killing an innocent bystander , and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found themselves suddenly surrounded by a hostile mob , which seemed to materialize at the slightest hint of a disturbance . To keep this uneasy situation from getting any worse , the police have created something called Project 9 , which consists of an informal committee of local citizens , LEN ' representatives , and police officers , and is the power hack of the newsletter . The first issue contained articles on law enforcement , a list of telephone numbers useful in emergencies ( " ComisiOn de Control de Alquileres , " " Departamento de Salud , " and the like ) , and an announcement that anyone with " complaints or suggestions regarding police service " should get in touch with Captain John Keenan , the precinct commander , Or one of his lieutenants . The other day , not with complaints or suggestions but in order to obtain more information , we sought out Cap tain Keenan , and we found him surprisingly hopeful about the future of the Ninth . " I have a rough average of fifty men on duty at a time , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand people . It 's obvious that the people must like and respect that man if he is to exercise any sort of control over them . The language harrier greatly increases our problem . We have only a few patrolmen who can speak even high-school Spanish and only two detectives who are really fluent in the language . We decided last fall that we had to convince these people that we are here to serve them  --  that this is both our duty and our wish . We realized we had to appeal to them in their own language , and the newsletter seemed the best way to accomplish this . If it catches on , we hope it will help them to see us as individuals , not as an army of anonymous and unpopular intruders . The newsletter is only a start . It is a statement of good faith on our part . It is a promise of friendship . When the first heat wave strikes this summer , we 'll be able to tell how much good it has done . " ? SIGN observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suits Hand Pressed ? $1 Strictly Hand Pressed ? $1.50 An Enclave RECENTLY , at nine o'clock on an inclement morning , with sleep and snowflakes in our eyes , we made our way to the operations office of Lincoln Center , at 10 Columbus Circle , to call on the Center 's new president , William Schuman , who , at fifty-one , is also president emeritus of the Juilliard School of Music , past director of publications for the musical firm of G. Schirmer , and composer of seven symphonies , not to mention numerous chamber and choral works . When we entered his office  --  a very businesslike place , with a couple of water colors of Philharmonic Hall as the only decoration Mr. Schuman , a rather tall , slender man with a narrow face , was sitting in his chair looking thoughtfully out of a window beside his desk . He was beautifully turned nut in a light-gray suit and dark-gray tie , and there was a shining fountain pen in his breast pocket . As he turned to greet us , we got a strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down across from him , but before we could speak he said , " I know the sort of things you would like to know . " We decided to let him do the talking . " The work at Lincoln Center is extremely demanding , but I like it , " he said , at a good clip . " The more work the better ; that is , if you have my feeling for organization . Take my organization of this day . I sprang out of bed at six-thirty , rushed down to the swimming pool in the basement of my house , in New Rochelle ( in summer I swim in an open-air pool in my hack yard ) , swam a hundred yards in tepid water , went back upstairs , shaved , took a hot shower , finished it off with an icy spray , read the T nni 's from beginning to end  --  editorials , obituaries , personal ads , real-estate ads , everything  --  and then drove to the office , in exactly fifty minutes , composing a little along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? he glanced at his desk pad ? " I 'll be seeing Robert Whitehead and Elia Kazan , co-producers of our repertory theatre , who are bringing in Robert Lewis , the Broadway director , for a talk . After them there will be Louis B. Ames , from the New York World 's Fair , and Reginald Allen , our executive director for operations . Then I must attend a reception at the Met , following which , with luck , I may be able to stop in at a small apartment I 've just taken across the street from the office and freshen up a hit and rest before going on to a concert or something , which my wife is sure to have planned . Somewhere along the line , I will have to slip in a couple of hours of composing ; I never let a year pass without spending six hundred hours composing . You see , you are seeing my public self , but this could n't exist without composing my private self . " We asked Mr. Schuman how he goes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind 's ear , " he said . " When I read a piece of music  --  I used to go through five thousand manuscripts a year at Schirmer 's  --  I can hear all the sounds in my mind 's ear : timpani , bass , violin , oboe . Like all composers , I carry this mind 's ear with me everywhere , and if I ca n't find time to sit down with a blank piece of paper in front of me , I rehearse the music in my mind . As I was driving through the lovely snow today , I was singing to myself . " He started singing , in a fine tenor , " **26;2287;TOOLONG ... " Having finished his embryonic theme , Mr. Schuman went on energetically , " I do n't compose all the time , but then no one can compose all the time . Su , instead of wasting my time , I administer . I am not one of those introspective artists , and , as it happens , both my artistic and my administrative talents are well suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I fit all this in . Well , I do n't socialize unless it 's a part of my job . I do n't drink , except perhaps a cocktail before dinner , and I never smoke . And , to tell the truth , if I take more than a month off during the year I get bored , no matter where I am  --  in Athens or Paris or just in Westchester . " Mr. Schuman beckoned us to his side and , waving a hand toward the Empire State Building , in the distance , said , " What a vista ! But this side of America is too well known to the world . I want the Center to represent our other side . " We returned to our chair . " My mind seethes with ideas and projects , " Mr. Schuman continued . " I can see them flowing past in my mind . I think of the Center as a gigantic project to present the positive side of America . It 's an enclave on Manhattan Island . This enclave is fourteen acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsterdam Avenues from Sixty-second to Sixty-fifth Streets , along with half a block of Sixty-sixth Street . Incidentally , we got the land cheap , under the federal slum-clearance law . " Mr. Schuman talked excitedly about the buildings that are going up or are about to go up in the enclave . There is Philharmonic Hall , which will open next September , perhaps with President Kennedy attending ( former President Eisenhower broke the ground for it ) ; there is the Vivian Beaumont Theatre , for repertory , which may one day leav en the cultural bread of Broadway ; there is the Library-Museum , which will be put up by the city ; there is the New York State Theatre , for dance and operetta , which will be built by the state and will eventua:ly be transferred to the city ; there is the new Juilliard School of Music ; and there is the new Me tropolita 11 Opera Ho use , which will at last make available to the company adequate facilities for staging operas . " I do n't mean that during ' Aida ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a laugh . " But the sets will be just great , The most miraculous thing I have n't told you yet . When the Center is finished , the federal , state , and city governments will all have participated and still the American tradition of private patronage of the arts will have been preserved . You see , to keep the Center alive with performing arts , we are raising , through private contributions , a special fund of ten million dollars , more than half of which is already in our hands . Of course , you understand that all the groups active at the Center will he autonomous bodies , but , with our special fund , we hope to
