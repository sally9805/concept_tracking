txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 26 ? Nancy Carole Tyler , secretary to Robert G. Baker , followed his example today by refusing to tell the Senate Rules Committee what she knew about his social and business affairs . She based her refusal to talk on general constitutional guarantees of the citizen 's right to privacy and against self-incrimination . To each of a score of questions posed by the committee counsel , L. P. , the 24-year-old witness repeated in a purring Tennessee accent a short prepared statement asserting her claim to immunity . She was constantly advised by her lawyer , Myron G , Ehrlich , who sat at her side . Unlike Mr. Baker yesterday , Miss Tyler , a former beauty contest winner , and Mr. Ehrlich welcomed the presence of television cameras in the ? hearing room . She wore a heavy , dark make-up well adapted to television lights , and turned smilingly this way and that at the request Of cameramen . Miss Tyler was spared the barrage of frequently loaded questions that members of the committee asked of Mr. Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. 's Interrogation was relatively brief and was confined mainly to her duties as Mr. Baker 's secretary and her occupancy of a town house owned by Mr. Baker . When he completed his questioning , other members of the panel passed up the opportunity to ask questions . The proceedings were over in about an hour . The committee is investigat // ing the varied private business dealings of Mr. Baker , who resigned as secretary to the Senate Democratic majority after a $300,000 damage suit was filed against him . Miss Tyler 's arrival in the marble pillared Senate caucus room a few minutes before 10 o'clock this morning created a hubbub that appeared to unsettle her momentarily . The overflow crowd of spectators , many of them young women , craned and stood on chairs to get a better view of her . Mr. Ehrlich took her arm and escorted her through the crowd to the witness table . She wore a bright blue outer coat over a stylish two-piece dress of bulky off-white silk , with quarter-length black kid gloves and black high-heel shoes . Refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in Mr. Baker 's office when certain conversations or events are alleged to have taken place . She has been said to have knowledge of some financial transactions and trips in which Mr. Baker took part . Before the hearing opened this morning , Mr. Ehrlich told reporters that his client would refuse to answer the committee 's questions . " This investigation has no legislative purpose , " he said " and it involved an invasion of her right of privacy . " " I do n't care what kind of questions they ask , " he said . " I 've practiced law longer than most of those fellows sitting at the table . The powers of Congress are set forth in the Constitution , and it does not give them the right to violate a person 's privacy in this kind of proceeding . " Mr. Ehrlich said that his position did not require recourse to any particular provision of the Constitution . In this , his stand differed materially from that asserted yesterday by Mr. Baker 's attorney , Edward Bennett Williams , who invoked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigation by F.B.I . When the session was opened by the committee chairman , Senator B. Everett Jordan , Democrat of North Carolina , Mr. Ehrlich asked that his client be allowed to read a statement before the questioning began . This set forth in detail his Constitutional arguments . In addition , Miss Tyler 's statement said that she was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that her telephone service had been suspended after committee investigators subpoenaed telephone company ) records . With her voice betraying an , occasional faint tremor , the , brown-eyed Miss Tyler said : " Alleged information given out by this committee and others in authority to the press , radio and television reporters has resulted in some worldwide intimations and suggestions that I have indulged in improper conduct , to say the least , and I have been held up to ridicule and disrepute by them on many occasions . " I deny that I am guilty of any legal or moral wrongdoing , but I am availing myself of this constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A long colloquy between Mr. Ehrlich and Mr. failed to resolve the controversy over whether Miss Tyler 's rights would be violated by answering the committee 's questions . As Mr. put questions to her , she responded to each with this brief prepared recitation . " I decline to answer on the ground that this investigation is unrelated to any legislative purpose and is an invalid invasion of my right of privacy ; and I decline to answer on the further ground that my answer might tend to incriminate me . " Questions on Her Job Among the questions that Miss Tyler refused to answer were these : ( Iliad she been employed in the office of the Senate majority secretary prior to Oct. 7 , 1963 ? ( Mad she left this job voluntarily ? ( Had her duties included those of confidential secretary to Mr. Baker ? ( Had she also performed duties of a private nature for him ? ( Had she ever occupied a house at 308 N Street , S. W. , and from whom had she rented ? ( Had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit against Mr. Baker , and been asked to intervene with Mr. Baker in his behalf ? ( Had Edward Levinson , previously identified with Las Vegas gambling interests , visited Mr. Baker 's office ? ti Had she deposited large sums of cash in a bank for Mr. Baker ? When the committee counsel ended his interrogation , the three Republican members held a brief , whispered conference and said they had no questions to ask Miss Tyler . She was then excused from the stand . Yesterday , two Republican Senators , Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska and Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania , questioned Mr. Baker at length . Senator Scott told reporters he was considering asking that both witnesses be brought before the bar of the Senate for trial on contempt . In case of a conviction , he said , they could be held in the Capitol jail for the rest of this session of Congress . The only trouble , he said , was that he was unsure there was still a jail in the Capitol basement . This punitive procedure has not been used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Architect of the Capitol said tonight that there had never been a jail in the Capitol . The nearest approximation is the so-called Guard Room in the old Senate Office Building , which has occasionally been used for temporary detention .
