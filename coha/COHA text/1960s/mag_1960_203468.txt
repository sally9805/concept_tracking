Just before stepping out of an airtight mock-up nose cone at Ohio 's Wright Air Development Center last week , Civilian Engineer Courtney Metzger took a swig of water . " It tastes much better than the ordinary kind in the supply tank , " he reported to Space Physician John Paul Stapp . Agreed Stapp : " It 's no worse than some of the stuff you get at cocktail parties . " As part of Project Hermes , a program that aims to give the first space travelers all the comforts of hygiene , the water had been distilled from Metzger 's urine . <P> In the longest test to date of life-sustaining equipment for spacemen , Stapp 's Aeromedical Laboratory sealed Metzger away for seven days and nights . Using only as much power as solar batteries would provide , the experiment tested water-disposal and odor-removal systerr other devices ranging from a thermoelectric refrigerator to a tiny oven built to heat toothpaste-type tubes of mashed potatoes , vegetables and turkey . <P> Metzger ate twice a day ( he lost 4 Ibs. ) , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-ft. diameter cone , slept only six hours a night but made up for it by lying on his back some twelve hours a day , doing nothing at all . Sheets of potassium superoxide absorbed his breath , removed the potentially poisonous carbon dioxide and released the fresh oxygen that he lived on all week . He came through so well that the space doctors are now at last ready to try the test in the weightless condition of actual space , first with animals , then with men .
