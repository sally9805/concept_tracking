No more than two decades ago , the grounding of all the commercial flights in the U.S. would have caused hardly a ripple in the nation 's transportation pattern . Last week the U.S. discovered just how dependent it has become on the airplane , which now crisscrosses the U.S. over hundreds of routes that form a tightly knit skein , carrying more than 94 million passengers in a year-more than intercity trains and buses combined . In the biggest airline strike in the nation 's history-the last one of any size was in 1961-the International Association of Machinists struck and grounded five of the biggest U.S. airlines : Eastern , Northwest , TWA , National and United . <P> Ordinarily , the five transport a total of 150,000 people a day , tot up no less than 61.5% of all U.S. airline passenger-miles . They serve 231 cities and 23 foreign countries , carry fully 70% of the nation 's mail . The strike against them came at a time when more Americans were flying than ever before , and at the very height of the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and 13 regional carriers could scarcely begin to cope with the enormous demand for flight space among affluent Americans bound for vacations , conventions and business appointments . Some airlines had so extended their equipment for the rush season that they could manage to add only a few flights at best . <P> Ingenious Ways . The result was chaos . Airports were first jammed with stranded passengers , then all but deserted as passengers realized the futility of trying to get on the few flights flying . Bus depots across the country were jammed and railroad stations crowded . Rent-a-car firms revved up every available roadworthy vehicle for service , then happily handled orders from travelers willing to drive from Boston to Denver or from Los Angeles to Atlanta . U.S. mail piled up in sacks everywhere , to be delivered a day or several days late . Pentagon officials moved swiftly to arrange for extra planes for priority flights for Viet Nam-bound servicemen on leave . In New York and San Francisco , thousands of high-spirited , conventioneering Lions and Shriners became stranded . <P> Some people found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco businessman who had to get to New York on crucial business booked a seat on Pan American to London , flew over the polar ice cap , then flew from London across the Atlantic to New York . Cost : $607 . Many found that they could move between the East Coast and Chicago by flying via Montreal or Toronto on Air Cana da , and others hopscotched erratically across the U.S. by taking any available flight that would take them on a dogleg route home . At New York 's Kennedy Airport and others , entrepreneurial types rented private airplanes , then canvassed passengers waiting in line to share the ride and the cost .
