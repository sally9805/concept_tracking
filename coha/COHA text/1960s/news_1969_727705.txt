State Department officials and foreign diplomats alike see it as a growing obstacle to final settlement of the Arab-Israeli impasse . Despite the wide divergence of political leanings represented by the various guerrilla organizations , the most significant group , Al Fatah , is purposely nonideological . Only a year ago , experts here agree , this organization could have been controlled by the Arab leadership . Today it 's a diffierent story . Funds are reaching Al Fatah from one end of the Arab world to the other  --  from Morocco in the West to Iran and Pakistan in the East . Libya even has a payroll-deduction system so that government employees may contribute directly to the - guerrilla effort . Other Arab countries are considering doing the same . To one former top American official on Middle East affairs , support of guerrillas by Arabs of all walks of life , including intellectuals , is reminiscent of the support given the Israeli cause by world Zionists ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since Israel was established in 1948 , this fervency has been the one factor notably missing in Arab causes .

VISTA , the nation 's domestic peace corps , is increasingly attracting volunteers with specific professional training for service in poverty areas . It used to be that most VISTA volunteers were young people thoroughly dedicated but lacking particular job skills . Now 86 percent have had at least some college . And by the end of this fiscal year ( June 30 ) more than 40 percent of the 4,600 volunteers will be those with special training . Many of the present year-long volunteers are law-school graduates , education or health specialists . A few have majored in city planning . People with such qualifications can usually give more help to the poor . Then too , blacks are tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will accept outsiders if they have special skills .

Merchants along one of Washington 's rebuilding , riot-scarred business corridors are trying to instill a prouder image in the area . For a starter , the Columbia Heights Businessmen 's Association suggests changing the name of 14th Street in the city 's Northwest section to Martin Luther King Boulevard . Eventually the 80-percent black group hopes to have Mrs. Coretta King ( Dr. King 's widow ) dedicate a statue of the Negro leader at a point along the troubled thoroughfare .
