Planet of the Apes " The monkey , " said Henry Ward Beecher , " is an organized sarcasm upon the human race . " The sarcasm is seldom allowed to speak for itself in this film about a space odyssey that goes awry and crash-lands three astronauts on an unknown planet . They have been traveling for a cool millennium or so , but their craft has been zooming along at close to the speed of light , and so-in accordance with Einstein 's Time-Dilation Theory-they have scarcely aged , save for some grey in their beards . At first , all they find is sand , but soon they stumble across a primitive tribe of mute cave people . " If this is the best they 've got , we 'll be running this planet in three months , " smirks the skipper , played by Charlton Heston . <P> The best they 've got , however , is not dumb men but clever monkeys , hideous primates in leather jackets who periodically catch humans in nets for laboratory experiments or to put in cages at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and soon he is pleading for his life before the head orangutan ( Maurice Evans ) , who wants him gelded and then melded into the tribe of cavemen . Aided by two empathetic chimpanzees ( Roddy MacDowall and Kim Hunter ) , Heston eventually makes his escape across forbidden territory where no monkey hand has ever set foot . There he learns the dreadful secret of why evolution has been reversed , and why simians , not men , rule this most earthlike sphere . <P> The novel by Pierre Boulle ( The Bridge on the River Kwai ) about the conflict of man and monkey was a clever , abrasive piece of science friction . But on the screen the story has been reduced from Swiftian satire to self-parody . The script is cluttered with man-monkey analogies , as crude as " Human see , human do , " " I never met an ape I did n't like " and " he was a gorilla to remember . " At one point , three of the simians simultaneously cover their eyes , ears and mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Jacobs ' decision to allocate $1,000,000 for masks and costumes . The makeup boys have given him his money 's worth with the most beastly metamorphoses since Lon Chaney moonlighted as the Wolf Man .
