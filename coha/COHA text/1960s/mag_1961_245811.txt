In the opinion of many a newspaper editor , the typical reporter is a near illiterate who is dedicated to the proposition that the preposition is to end sentences with . To help the reporter overcome his ignorance , most newspapers provide him with a style book-and in their very diversity , newspaper style books make some of the most entertaining reading to be found anywhere . <P> The style books do not always agree on usage . The Indianapolis Star spells it " clew , " the Indianapolis News " clue . " Most papers capitalize Pope , but the Miami Herald does not . In most papers , rape is rape , but in the Memphis Commercial Appeal it is usually criminal attack . The Minneapolis Star and Tribune permit partial decommissioning of generals ( " If it 's Lt. Gen. John A. Jones in the first reference , plain Jones will suffice in later references " ) , but in the New York Times , once a general always a general . And no paper cares to folo the trail blazed by the Chicago Tribune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru , sirup , burocracy . <P> All Women Are n't Ladies . Disagreements multiply in the areas of race and religion . The Miami Herald draws a careful distinction between white cops , who are always " policemen , " and Negro cops , who are always " patrolmen . " In the Memphis Commercial Appeal if a minister is white , he is " the Rev. , " if Negro he is simply " Rev. " The Denver Post is explicit on Roman Catholic ritual : " Mass is celebrated , said or read . High Mass is sung , never held . The Rosary is recited or said , never read . " But the Miami News takes the easy way out : " Write it ' the mass ( or rosary ) will be at 7 p.m. ' rather than having it sung , read , held , recited , given or said . " <P> Matters of taste and the social amenities come under close stylebook scrutiny . The Buffalo Evening News avoids " mention of hideous creatures or gruesome circumstances " and substitutes " glamorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reporters to " write nothing that will spoil the appetite . " The Chicago Tribune permits " s.o.b. , " but defines it as a " Trumanism . " The Los Angeles Times , concluding that all women are n't ladies , ungallantly applies its conclusion : " A salesgirl or a saleswoman is not a saleslady , and a washerwoman is not a washlady , so a scrubwoman can not be a scrublady . " In Detroit , the News withholds the title of " Mr. " from all males who are not Protestant clergy , dead , or the President of the United States . " However , " cautions the News , " other cases may arise in which a ' tone of respect is desirable ; in such cases Mr. may be used . "
