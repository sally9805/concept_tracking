THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN the years when the Vietnam war was still escalating , it often seemed that Washington was enlarging our official war goals to match and justify the escalation of our military commitment . At first , when the commitment was small , it was enough to believe that we were protecting democracy in Vietnam . Later , as our forces grew , the domino theory was advanced , to show that the real stake was the future of freedom in all Southeast Asia . And in the final days , when the present level of half a million men had been reached , we were told that the true enemy was China and " Asian Communism . " Likewise , the growing commitment , and the growing losses , seemed to require increasingly optimistic reports on the progress of the war . Then , as the gap between the official optimism and the reality- widened , it began to seem that we were fighting as much to vindicate our past pronouncements as to achieve any concrete objective in Vietnam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could transform it into the kind of war we 'd thought we were going to he fighting in the first place . Thus it has happened that , along with a tragic , unhopeful position within Vietnam , the Nixon Administration has inherited a ponderous baggage of grandiose war aims and dogmatically optimistic appraisals of our achievement . Now that President Nixon 's own people have opened the substantive phase of the negotiations in Pans , it may prove that the inflated war aims we have built up will turn out to be our most serious obstacle to reaching a settlement . Success in the negotiations may depend in large part on our finding a way to hack down gracefully from the war aims that were devised to support the policy of escalation . No issue reveals our predicament more clearly than the issue of a coalition government , on which we are now taking the stand , in support of the regime in Saigon , that there can he no coalition that would include the National Liberation Front . The present Saigon government is probably unique in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galbraith estimated that it would collapse within a month if American support were to be completely withdrawn . Actually , it had already collapsed  --  not just once but again and again , as it was driven from the countryside by the enemy and repeatedly overturned by coups d'etat . Its continued existence depends on American support more heavily than any government has ever relied on foreign support before . Over ninety per cent of the government 's revenue is donated by the United States . Every one of its officials , down to the level of district chief , has been assigned a full-time American adviser of equal military rank , so the entire administration is paralleled by an American structure . Every unit of its Army is advised by a team of Americans , and its Army is equipped entirely with American weapons . Since almost all transportation in Vietnam , whether of people or of things , is by air , most of it is American . A Vietnamese province chief receives a salary that derives ultimately from American sources , he commands an army that is clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people food and housing that arrive on American planes , and he receives the full-time advice of an American colonel . What makes this condition of total dependence difficult to perceive is that although the Saigon regime owes its existence to us , it does not appear to give us its allegiance . No doubt because . American policymakers havc genuinely wished  --  however abortive their efforts to make the wish come true  --  the Saigon regime to become a strong democratic government , our sty le has been to let its leaders go on making bitter anti-American remarks in their public speeches . Many observers have seen Saigon 's freedom to criticize us as a sign that it must have a base of support apart from us . But the whole question of whether Saigon behaves as we would like it to or not is a side issue . The fundamental issue is whether the Saigon region exists at all as a government not in relation to us but in relation to its own people  --  and whether it has any chance of continuing to exist if we leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been unable to set up effective administration or get visible popular support for any of its many projects of construction , and , in fact , has overseen the destruction , mostly by allied bombing , of roughly half of its villages and some of its cities , too , may not deserve the name " government " at all . It would be more accurate to call it a conscripted army and leave it at that  --  or , insofar as it exists in other ways for its people , to call it a public-relations firm . Even to call it a corrupt dictatorship is , in a sense , ton cotnplimentary , because to speak of corruption is to imply that what is corrupt was once healthy , and to speak of a dictatorship implies a deFENUJARY 1 1909 gree of control that Saigon does not exercise over its people . Its one talent is for destruction , and this is borrowed from us . The question of a coalition government is , therefore , one of whether we can assure the Saigon regime 's participation in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the National Liberation Front  --  which is now certainly the most powerful political force in South Vietnam  --  participate . When one considers how little the Saigon regime has achieved with the help of half a million Americans , one can hardly imagine that , in the long run , it can survive without us . The idea that we could afford to demand a settlement without a coalition had been an integral part of the set of views on Vietnam that led the Johnson Administration to believe year after year that the feeble Saigon government was about to gain the allegiance of the ? ? South Vietnamese and that we were about to win the war . To persist in that demand now , at the negotiating table , is to place our negotiators in the impossible position of being unable even to consider the solution that is the most favorable one we can conceivably hope for , and the one that may offer us our only way of getting our troops home soon . Tunnel THE most recent skirmish between our visible city and its subterranean Doppelg2inger occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Manhattan end of the Williamsburg Bridge blew up shortly before midnight , scattering chunks of pavement along Delancey Street for several blocks and setting off a two-alarm fire that was allowed to blaze , and burn off the gas , until four o'clock the following afternoon . Although the explosion created the customary inconveniences  --  service on two subway lines was suspended , bridge traffic was halted , and three hundred families were evacuated from nearby tenements there were , miraculously , no deaths and only five minor injuries . ( Two firemen were hit by flying debris , two Con Edison employees were blown off their feet by the force of the blast , and a girl seated in an automobile on Delancey Street was slammed headfirst into the windshield . ) The most extraordinary ( and embarrassing ) aspect of the incident , however , was the fact that until it occurred neither Con Edison nor any of the city agencies that tend our catacombs  --  Transit , Water Resources , and Water Supply , Gas &; Electricity  --  had been aware of the tunnel 's existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ( the walls were of precast concrete ; the floor contained a narrow-gauge railroad track ) , there was no record of such a structure on any working maps of the area . The available evidence suggested that the tunnel had been built in the early nineteen-hundreds and then , for some reason , abandoned . A sixteen-inch gas main that was installed two feet farther north at a later date transformed this scaled-up cavern into a buried time bomb . The first hint of the unusual origin of the explosion came from the Fire Department . Chief Fire Marshal Vincent Canty , who arrived at Delancey ' Street twenty minutes after the original alarm , told us during a talk we had with him later that every one of the eighty-odd firemen on duty that night had known there was something odd about the blast . " When gas is confined in an unvented space , you get an explosion , " he said . " And since this was a long , narrow explosion , extending for several blocks , there had to be some kind of lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was that the fire seemed to be coming from an area between the subway , which runs down the center of Delancey Street , and the gas main , which runs along the north curb . " Shortly after the second alarm was turned in , Chief Allen Hay  --  the man in operational control of the fire  --  sent one of his officers to check with the Transit Authority , on the chance that this mysterious void might have something to do with the subway . At 12:30 A.M. , Transit , after an amazingly swift search through its archives , uncovered an ancient blueprint that indicated there were two sealed-off tunnels underneath Delancey Street  --  one on either side of the 13. - M.T. line . " They told us that the tunnels were built in 1908 , " said Chief Flay . " Possibly to carry utility lines . Each one is about twenty-five hundred feet long . We have n't explored them completely , but we believe they extend from Essex , on the east , to Centre or Mulberry , on the west . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Essex , and maybe something else on Eldridge . We do n't know all the exact positions , because Transit has n't shown us the blueprint , but we are certainly going to recommend that all subsurface voids in the area he located and filled in as soon as possible . I do n't think anybody in the present city government had the slightest idea that these tunnels existed , but the facts seem to point toward . Transit as having something to do with their construction . Where the responsibility lies at the moment I really ca n't say . I can tell you one thing , though . Nobody is rushing forward to claim it . " After checking with the Transit Authority ( " We do have a 1908 blueprint showing some tunnels , but they certainly are n't ours " ) , the Corporation Counsel ( " How can you be absolutely sure that this alleged tunnel caused the explosion ? " , and Water Resources ( " Our snaps do n't indicate any tunnels , but our engineers did encounter two outside tunnel walls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they installed a high-pressure main in 1953 " ) , we travelled to Delancey Street to consult a Con Edison official who had been following the case . He told us , somewhat plaintively , that no city department had ever provided his company with any information that even hinted at the existence of a tunnel . " My God ! " he said . " We had crews all over the place the day before the explosion looking for a low-pressure gas leak . If we 'd had any idea that there was a tunnel nearby , we would have proceeded quite differently . " We then accompanied the Con Ed official west on Delancey  --  past several blocks of buckled asphalt  --  and paused near the edge of a large excavation at the corner of Allen Street , where we were introduced to Mr. Peter Salerno , the Con Edison foreman in charge of the district at the time of the blast . Mr. Salerno , a stocky , soft-spoken man who was wearing earth-stained corduroy work clothes and a shiny blue hard hat , informed us that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine gas-leak report from this very corner . " We sent a contract crew down the next morning , because it was n't serious , " he said . " No odor in the street but a positive reading inside the manhole you 're standing on . So they opened up the pavement here on the north side of Delancey . When I arrived at noon on Friday , there was a flame burning in the excavation and a Ere truck standing by . I had brought a crew with me , and I called in three more , because it looked as if we might have to cut the flow of gas to determine the source of the Ere . " Mr. Salerno pointed to a smaller hole some twenty feet north of us on Allen and explained that most low-pressure gas mains do not have turn-off valves . " If you want to take an area out of service , you have to dig down to the main  --  as they did up there  --  knock a hole in it , and insert an expandable plug that shuts off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our plates showed two sixteen-inch mains in the area  --  one running north and south on Allen , the other running east and west on Delancey . So I told my crews to start breaking ground at the corners , just in case . At the same time , we decided to enlarge the original hole in the middle of the street to see if the fire could he coming from the point where the two mains crossed . " Mr. Salerno showed us two large , rusty pipes at the bottom of the excavation and told us his men had uncovered them about 5 P.M. " The mains were intact , but fire was coming out of the ground around them , " he said . " I just could n't understand this , so I told the corner crews to start tapping  --  that is , plugging up the mains  --  as a safety measure . We got four shutdowns by ten that evening , but the flames continued to burn in the excavation . My crews put in a second set of stoppers , and when that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of a sneaky tie somewhere . just about then , a workman who was still following the fire opened up the tunnel . Now , voids 26 FEBRUARY 1 , 1 9 6 9 turn up fairly often on jobs  --  usually they 're the result of street work that has n't been properly filled  --  but when you find one near a gas leak , you stop and think a minute . I sent the man who was operating our mechanical digger off to refuel , and I was standing there looking at the void with a flashlight when she just let go . The funny thing about that explosion was that it put nut the fire we 'd been chasing all afternoon . Five minutes later  --  when we were all picking ourselves up off the sidewalk  --  there was a much bigger bang , and a fire two blocks east , at the corner of Delancey and Ludlow . " We asked Mr. Salerno why the street damage had not been repaired , and he replied that Con Edison could not pull out the old mains or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the tunnel . " We 're servicing our customers through surface pipe , " he said , " and taking hourly readings in the tunnel to make sure there 's no underground gas buildup . I was dumbfounded when I found nut about that tunnel , but I was kind of relieved , too . When you work on the street twenty-two years , you know that a low-pressure gas main does n't just blow up like that . " Our final encounter with the Delancey ' Street explosion took place several days later , at a Public Service Commission hearing that had been called to determine the responsibility of the utilities concerned , and whether or not there was a safety hazard . Attendance was sparse ( none of the city agencies directly involved showed up ) , and the two witnesses who did appear and testify  --  a Commission gas engineer and a Con Edison senior vicepresident  --  proved extremely reluctant to recognize the obvious relationship between a leaking gas main and a sealed-up tunnel . The engineer suggested that the explosion might have been caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considerably inure imaginative , and came up with marsh gas , a substance that is rarely encountered in the bedrock of Manhattan Island . The most disturbing impression that emerged from a long day of inconclusive talk was of an almost visible miasma of distrust that seemed to preclude cooperation , or even communication , among the various groups involved in subsurface work . When the Commission 's counsel asked if there were any maps showing all utilities in the substructure of New York City , the Con Edison vice-president replied that he knew of only one set  --  a series prepared by the W.P.A. in the thirties . " This tunnel , " he added , " was not on that map . " The existence of additional tunnels , which were also net on the map , was not discussed . The 1908 Transit Authority blueprint showing them  --  which nearly everyone in the room knew about  --  was never produced , or even mentioned . The question of who owns the tunnels and who will fill them in was put off until February 6th . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , so that we will have more definitive answers than we have at present , " the presiding Public Service Commissioner , Edward P. Larkin , remarked pointedly . After the hearing was adjourned , we asked Commissioner Larkin , a robust man wearing tortoiseshell glasses , what he planned to accomplish at the next session . " I want to determine who has jurisdiction over these substructures , " he said , " and I 'm going to push for a proper engineering conclusion as to their potential danger . Then I 'm going to see what can be done to remove the danger . Maybe it will he done by a collection taken up by the outraged citizenry , once they realize the potential hazard . Suppose a bomb fell on Times Square and failed to explode . Would everybody stand around looking at it for months ? Would n't somebody have to make a decision ? " " I hear they just found another tunnel up in the Bronx , " said a portly , gray-haired man standing at the Commissioner 's right elbow . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted himself a slight smile . " I 'm beginning to understand why the usual city representatives have n't been down liere pointing with pride and viewing with alarm , " he said . " Perhaps they 're afraid they 'll get stuck with a tunnel . " Inauguration WHEN we heard that an old friend of ours , Dr. Clement Wilson Bell , planned to he in Washington at Inauguration time , we asked him to drop us a few informative lines after the festivities . Dr. Bell is a retired professor of comparative civilizations at a small , choice Midwestern college ; he is totally detached and nonpartisan , and casts a cold eye . Herewith , his report : " iivc ! I have just returned from what you might call a city of masks , and no mask is more compelling than the one assumed by defeated persons departing from public life . Not for them the visible tear , the long face , the hapless slouch . Several days prior to the Inauguration , I found my self a late-afternoon guest in the classical red brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to President Johnson . He had gathered together a stellar group , Lid by Vice-President Humphrey , who had , as you know , been on the wrong end of the recent returns . Here and there I spotted several Associate Justices of the-Supreme Court , exuding permanence and dignity , but for the most part this cheerful , tinkling house was occupied by those going out rather than those staying in . Mr. Humphrey was tanned , ebullient , brisk , and trim as he moved swiftly around the room , a glint in his et e and a spring to his walk . I am not saying that this man was happy . I am say ing that he appeared happy , and that no shadow of malevolence or envy crossed his face , and I admired the mask , if mask it was . I sat down beside a handsome woman who was wearing a high-rise birdhouse of a hat  --  a birdhouse with duplex , even triplex apartments . ' Presumably , there is a good deal of moving out , of sad farewells , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Who 's moving ? We 'll sit this one out ; we sat out the last one . Nobody 's moving except the Katzenbachs and Betty Furness . ' She- had herself recently received a surprisingly cordial letter from the President-elect , who thanked her-for some good wishes he had heard she had expressed in his behalf . ' I puzzled over this , ' she said , ' for I fought him hard in the campaign , and then I remembered that I had taken a train ride with an associate of his and had passed some generalities about the rigors of the job , and said that I wished him well . I 'm not Sure it 's his real signature , but I admire his system . ' " Washington can be miserable in the rain , even before so gala an event as an Inauguration . Georgetown  --  manicured , precise , a bijou  --  dues not lend itself , streaming wet , to elevation of the spirit . Downtown , the huge government buildings melt into square and heavy shadow . In the back streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stooped houses and faceless windows . The people brace themselves against the wind and the rain , and bustle along and betray nothing . They could be in Providence or St. Louis or Denver , trying to stay dry and warm . I wandered into the handsomely restored Ford 's Theatre , and was instantly gripped by the melancholy and haunting past . The pert young guide from the National Park Service had done her homework . She had the details at her fingertips . ' The assassin first had a few drinks at a nearby bar to get up his courage , and then sneaked tip the main stairs over there , and into the President 's box , with his dagger and his derringer , ' she said . ' The President and Mrs. Lincoln were side by side , Major Rathbone a few feet away . The assassin fired point blank , vaulted over the box rail , caught his spurs on the
