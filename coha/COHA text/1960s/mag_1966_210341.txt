Gifts are fairly showering this week on Washington , D.C. Up on the walls of the National Gallery are two new Old Masters . Both are from the Low Countries : a rare Vermeer and an early 15th century Flemish miniature ( see opposite page ) . Both have touches of mystery in their past . After nearly 400 years both are only now reaching the province of the public eye . <P> There are only about 40 works in the world solidly attributed to Vermeer , fewer than half a dozen outside of museums . Highly esteemed while he lived , the 17th century master of Delft was forgotten from his death until the 19th century , only to be rediscovered by the likes of J. Pierpont Morgan , who bought A Lady Writing in 1907 . Vermeer , who usually showed his women in profile or looking away , made this lady all the more appealing by turning her full face to the viewer . <P> " It has all the subtle magic of Vermeer 's art , " exclaims Director John Walker , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , the sense of suspended action and above all the tranquillity . " One expert estimates that the Vermeer would have fetched $3 million on the auction block , but it will cost the National nothing . The gift of Harry Waldron Havemeyer and Horace Havemeyer Jr . in memory of their father , the late Horace Havemeyer of the sugar-refining family , it will become the gallery 's property upon the death of his widow . <P> St. George and the Dragon , bought with funds from Ailsa Mellon Bruce , is even rarer and richer , considering its size . So small is the postcard-shaped ( 5 ? in. by 4 ? in. ) oil that the gallery has built a magnifying glass in the showcase ; so costly is it that the work was auctioned last March for $26,552 per sq . in . At the sale , it was called a Hubert van Eyck , but the National 's curators now attribute it to Rogier van der Weyden . They suspect that St. George is one part of a diptych whose matching half , which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great on the back , is owned by Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza in Switzerland .
