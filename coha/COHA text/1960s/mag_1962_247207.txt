" This is Ted Kennedy , " said the voice over the telephone . <P> " No , it is n't , " replied the female delegate to Massachusetts ' Democratic convention . <P> " Yes , it is . " <P> " If you are , then tell me the date of the President 's birthday . " <P> With that , the voice , which was indeed Ted Kennedy 's , whispered in a frantic aside to aides standing near by : " When 's the President 's birthday ? Is it the 27th or the 29th ? " <P> Said an aide : " I do n't remember . " <P> Said the voice to the woman delegate : " May 27th . " <P> " No , it is n't , " said she , and slammed the receiver down . <P> That was one vote that Teddy Kennedy presumably lost in his effort to win endorsement by Massachusetts Democrats convening in Springfield last week . But he won enough to force Attorney General Edward McCormack Jr . to concede midway through the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddie figured he was well ahead . Both through his own record as a regular Massachusetts Democrat and as House Speaker John McCormack 's nephew , Eddie commanded the loyalties of the state 's party pros . But those pros proved loyal only up to the point where they came into conflict with the techniques and power of a Kennedy . <P> Real Shaked . Even before the balloting began , the McCormack men could see defeat in the offing . Eddie 's dad , " Knocko " McCormack , sat sadly in the Cheddar Cheese Room , an eatery in the bowels of Springfield 's Sheraton-Kimball Hotel , and spoke darkly about the Kennedy lieutenants . " They 're cold , they 're cold , " said old Knocko . " I got here at 12:30 last night , and I got in the elevator with an old friend from Northampton . He 's been in the American Legion with me for years , and I say , ' Hello . <P> Commander . And he hangs his head , and he says , ' I ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? ' says I. ' I 've been offered a good federal job if I go with Kennedy , ' says he . <P> " And over in Worcester there 's another guy . He 's like a first cousin to me for 40 years . How would you like to be shaked like that when he comes and says he 's not with you ? How do you like that ? He says they promised him the postmastership in Worcester . " Concluded Knocko : " It 's pressure , pressure , pressure , post office , post office , post office . " <P> 12-to-1 . Even the candidates ' arrivals in town were significantly different . Eddie came quietly and went to work in a modest Sheraton-Kimball headquarters suite . <P> Teddy blared into town behind a crack brass band to find a prearranged crowd , replete with pretty girl workers , awaiting him outside the hotel . Pulled up on a sound truck , Teddy began to speak-and his chopping gestures , his thrust-out chin , his flat inflections and staccato cadences were more than slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
