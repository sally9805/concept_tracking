met Chief Anderson returning from the sessions of the council to his own town . " Greetings , Chief , " he exclaimed warmly . " How are events at the council shaping up today ? " The casualness of his tone hardly revealed the excitement churning within him . A strange aura of hostility pervaded the chief 's attitude and was only heightened by his blunt " Ugh . " Furthermore , he appeared ill at ease , seeking to move on down the trail and break off the conversation . Lukenback , however , determined to learn as much as possible before walking into the tension-packed atmosphere of the town . With great trepidation he asked : " How is it with my dear old friend Joshua today ? " Koktowhanund drew himself up to his full height , planted his feet firmly against the ground , stuck out his chin , and , in a manner denoting his previous desire to avoid the subject , answered in a determined but guilty tone : " Joshua is dead !

Somehow I should  --  could have avoided it ! Merciful God , be merciful to him and take pity on me ! " Tears welled into his eyes . " Why , oh why , must they do these awful things ! " he said aloud to the stern chieftain . " They have slain an innocent man , do you hear  --  an innocent man ! " Anderson was stoically unmoved by the missionary 's grief . He replied cruelly : " Joshua deserved his doom , and other wicked people who make away with their fellowmen by poison or magic will meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kluges , Lukenback countered with a ringing condemnation of the reign of terror . " Evil days have come to Wapihani ! Wicked men have come to power . Burning at the stake is inhuman andp201barbarous  --  even for the guilty  --  to say nothing of poor , innocent people like Joshua ! I do not understand how the Delaware nation , which departed from such cruel practicesmany generations ago , who pride themselves on beinglooked up to by other tribes , can now stoop to such ungodly practices ! No one knows this better than the honoredKoktowhanund ! What has happened to you ? How can you countenance such practices ? " Caught in the web of The Prophet 's hypnotic control , Anderson retorted heatedly , his hand resting on his tomahawk . " You white people try your criminals , too , and whenever you find them guilty you hang or kill them by shooting . We are now doing the same among us . " For emphasis , he added : " Hockingpomska is now under arrest , but his fate has not been decided ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , he thanked him for the information and said " Good day ! " Turning , he continued on to Wapikomekoke , determined to go before the council and bluntly ask what the sentiment was as to the Kluges and himself . " DRAW YOUR TOMAHAWK , I TELL YOU ! " On March 17 , St. Patrick 's Day , The Prophet arrived back at Wapikomekoke from a witch-hunting jaunt downstream . Immediately he assumed the seat of judgment in the longhouse . Those currently accused of exercising evil powers were arraigned before him to receive justice , which meant to hear their fate ! The first one brought forwardwas Joshua , who had been sent back to prison by the old woman judge two days earlier to await condemnationby Temskwatawah himself . The old Christian convertwas escorted roughly before the tribunal , where he was told to admit his guilt , plead for forgiveness , and throw himself upon the mercy of the court ! " I can not admit guilt of something I have not done , " hep202replied firmly . This enraged the august person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evil one , " he commanded . Several of the young braves who had participated in the killing of Tatapaksit came forward and , in turn , told how Tatapaksit had implicated Joshua before his own death . The evidence was entirely second-handed , the testimony hearsay , as no one had actually seen him with the witch bag . Lawlewasikaw 's one eye gleamed a cold hatred as he listened intently to the witnesses . When the last had delivered his trumped-up testimony , the Supreme Judge signified by a disinterested shrug of his shoulders his intention to be through with the case . " It may be , " he stated in his fiercest tone , " that this man did not have the witch bag of Tatapaksit , but it is clearly evident that he does possess magic powers by which he is able to destroy a man 's life when he wishes to offer a victim to the white man 's God ! You do not deny , do you , " he asked in a wicked voice , " that you worship the God of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I do not deny it ! I worship the Great God of All Creation , who is both the God of the whites and our Great Spirit ! " This bold assertion was all The Prophet needed . Arising to his feet , he hurled bitter invective at the prisoner . " You blaspheme the name of the Great Master of Life ! You presume to tell me , Mandamon 's own messenger , of the Great Spirit when I have been told by him to destroy the power of the white man and his God from among the red people ! For your sacrilege against the Great Spirit , you are condemned to die ! " The eager , bloodthirsty followers of the Shawnee rushed forward , grabbed the defenseless old man , and dragged him from the longhouse toward a spot where a large fire had been kindled for the day 's executions . They placed Joshua near the leaping flames . The Prophet stepped up in front of the undaunted but humble old saint once more . " You have one last chance ! Renounce your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare your life ! " Calmly , without a hint of fear on his face , Joshua replied : " I believe in the white man 's God and testify of my faithp203in His Son , Jesus ! I am innocent of these false charges against me ! " For a few seconds there was complete silence over the scene . Only the crackling of the flames marred the calmnessof the midday setting . Lawlewasikaw stared incredulouslyat the brave old Christian who faced death so resolutely . Furiously , he stepped back and signaled by an impatient wave of his hand his order for the execution . A few seconds slipped by . A large warrior stepped nonchalantlyover to the fire where he lighted the tobacco in his tomahawk pipe . Returning to the outer circle he passed directly behind the condemned man . As he came up even with the doomed one he suddenly sank his tomahawk into the old man 's brain ! At that instant wild yells and screams of fury rent the air as the circle of warriors sprang forward and rained needless blows on the lifeless body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the body of Tatapaksit had been disposed of the previous day . The next prisoner to be brought before the judgment seat was Billy Patterson , another Christian Delaware and a nephew of Tatapaksit . Billy had lived among the whites for some time , acquiring considerable skill as a gunsmith . A brave and courageous man , he combined the best and highest aspects of both the Indian nature of stoic fatalism and the highest Christian zeal for dependence on eternal security which defies the worst that mortal man can heap upon one  --  a sublime enrapture in things spiritual that precludesconcern for earthly fate . He received The Prophet 's bitter words of condemnation with calm composure . To the one-eyed one 's enthusiastic offer of mercy if he would confess his magic practices and abandon the white man 's God , Billy scornfully answered : " You have frightened and destroyed one poor old man , Tatapaksit ! You have murdered that Christian saint , Joshua ! You can destroy me , too , but you can not frighten me ! " Then he taunted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and you shall see how a Christian and a warrior can die ! " Whereas Joshua had refused to confess , then stood passivelyby , Billy Patterson hurled The Prophet 's challenge back into his teeth ! There was only one course open to Lawlewasikaw . He sensed it was not the best course , butp204he dared not turn back ! He played out his part with dogged determination , voicing the condemnation in derogativebitterness . " You Christian dog , you shall die at the stake  --  slowly  --  until the flesh drops off your cursed bones and you beg for mercy  --  the mercy of a tomahawk into your worthless skull  --  but there will be no tomahawk for you ! We shall see if you do not change your Christian tune ! " For answer , Billy Patterson laughed derisively at the Shawnee persecutor , even as he was tied to the stake and the flames rose around him ! During the awful and hideouslyslow process of eliminating human life in the most excruciating pain , Billy Patterson proved to be every inch a Christian and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a shriek of terror , not an expression of regret or plea for mercy escaped his lips  --  never a look of misery crossed his shining countenance ! With his Bible in his hands he prayed , chanted hymns , and defied all the powers of evil to do their utmost to weaken him in his ordeal or destroy his faith in his God ! Finally , his noble voice was stifled and his indestructible , Christ-bound soul passed out of his human , charred body ! Billy Patterson joined the immortalranks of the martyrs of early Christiandom ! The august judge and his puppet council , their enthusiasm for witch burning considerably dampened by the experience of watching Billy Patterson die so bravely , moved back into the longhouse . Though he was shaken , Lawlewasikawknew he must not display his uncertainty . Tatapaksit'syoung wife , she who married the old chief after he had divorced his older wife , was the next alleged witch brought to trial . Crooked Nose , the ignominious , shamefulslayer of his own father , was her chief accuser . The Prophet listened impassively as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started noticeablywhen a large and black-painted warrior , one of his own select group of hatchet men , strode swiftly to the front of the council chamber . His unscheduled action was plainly defiant of the court ! The determined young brave stepped up to the dejected figure of the young woman defendant , took her by the hand and led her unhurriedly out of the building . No hand was raised to stop him . Lawlewasikaw was so surprised he spoke not a word , butp206watched unbelievingly as the prisoner was removed . Beforehe could recover his composure , the warrior reappeared in the rear of the longhouse and announced in loud and grave tones : " This woman is my sister ! She is not a witch as she has been accused . Brothers , the Evil Spirit has come upon us  --  for we are killing each other ! " Then he strode out of the building . For several seconds no words were voiced in the council . Lawlewasikaw knew that he must act quickly and forcefully or his whole programwould collapse . He deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted so boldly to free his sister  --  at least not just now ! Later this rash one might rue his untimely action in embarrassing The Great Prophet ! For now , he commanded in his most awesomeand thundering voice : " The case of Tatapaksit 's wife will be considered again at a later time . Bring the next prisoner before the council ! " This time the victims were a middle-aged woman and her nephew who , it was alleged , were accused of witch practices by use of an evil and powerful witch bag , the same old charge of previous cases . Both prisoners were cowed and frightened ! The nephew , a weak fellow in his early twenties , admitted freely his complicity in a series of crimes and other reprehensible acts . " Did you not , by means of this strange power in your bag , fly through the air to the southlands for the purpose of visiting relatives of the Creek nation ? " his chief prosecutorasked . " Yes , yes ! " he answered unhesitatingly . " Have you placed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Was this woman beside you involved with you in these evil doings ? " " Yes . " " Have you caused many women to be barren and others to miscarry ? " " Yes . " " Were you in league with Tatapaksit in performing evil deeds ? " " Yes . "  | " Were you secretly worshiping the God of the white man rather than the Great Spirit of your people ? " " Yes , " the accused man fairly shouted in anxiety , as he began to see that admission of guilt was not going to win his release . Lawlewasikaw had heard enough ! A conviction and swift justice were vital in this case to erase the memory of the unfortunate trial of Tatapaksit 's young widow . He did not offer or show leniency , despite the very apparent attempt of the prisoner at the bar to admit anything in order to obtain the mercy of the council . Both the weak-kneed nephew and his unhappy aunt were committed screaming to the fire ! One more prisoner was to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this prisoner 's appearance . All eyes in the longhouse turned toward the opening in the back of the hall where the prisoner 's entry was expected . Suddenly , a gasp of awe swept through the assembled redskins as the huge and commanding figure of the renowned Hockingpomska loomed proudly and defiantly in the doorway . Since Buckongehelis had been laid to rest three seasons before , Hockingpomska was the top leader of the Lenni-Lenape . But here he was  --  disgraced and fallen  --  a common prisoner standing at The Prophet 's bar of justice , accused of witchcraft and evil doings ! This was Lawlewasikaw 's greatest hurdle in gaining supremacy over the Delawares ! If he could successfully purge this tribal dignitary he would erase the only serious threat to his program of domination in this strategic central portion of the remaining Indian lands . Hockingpomska , in addition to being built of sterner stuff than Tatapaksit , also was not in the dotage of life 's flickering light . Nor was he resigned to his fate , as were the Christian Indians , without a struggle ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grabbed the initiative by advancing straight to the front of the room , shaking off easily the two guards who thought they had him in tow . Drawing up in front of The Prophet , Hockingpomskadid not wait for any formality . " Lawlewasikaw , " he stated bluntly , deliberately using his birth name  --  now anathema , " you are a liar and a coward ! "  |p208The  audacity of his momentous challenge stunned The Prophet . Hockingpomska launched on in his bitter denunciation . " Our young chieftain , Metamoris , who is at your brother 's side at this moment , was right in his appraisal of you ! He was able to look into your evil mind and see the treachery that lies there . He warned us not to listen to your raving or permit you to corrupt our minds . That warning went unheeded  --  to our great sorrow and shame ! " It was a tension-packed moment ! The judge suddenly became the defendant on trial and the prisoner was acting as the prosecutor ! Livid with rage , Lawlewasikaw appeared momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blunt critic . But nobody knew better than The Prophet that he would be no match for the hulking form of the aroused chief before him . In panic he looked at his guards and raised his hand to beckon them . Before he could say anything , Hockingpomska 's angry voice sounded on . " You are among us at our permission ! " Pointing his finger at the confused judge , he shouted : " You have betrayedour hospitality . You have returned evil for good . You have turned the young men against their chiefs . You are causing Lenni-Lenape to kill each other  --  innocent women and old men murdered by your order ! You are destroying everything your brother is striving to accomplish . You are an imposter and a coward before men ! " The Prophet could take this blistering denunciation no longer . He was faced with a challenge he could neither ignore nor squirm out of . He literally screamed at the guards who seemed to be frozen in immobility . " Seize him ! He blasphemes against the Great Master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seize him , I say ! " The guards hesitated , looking at each other questioningly . This gave Hockingpomska the opportunity to renew the attack . This , he realized , was his only hope of breakingThe Prophet 's spell on his tribesmen . " I warn you , Lawlewasikaw , if you make any charge of witchcraft against me as you did against our poor old chief Tatapaksit and the others , I shall bury my tomahawkin your worthless skull ! I will tolerate your evil no longer ! If Buckongehelis were alive he and I would have stood together and Tatapaksit would be living today , andp209that brave young man who taunted you and praised his God as you burned him at the stake would live also ! And you , Lawlewasikaw , would never again be allowed to show your face among the Lenape ! " By this time the guards had advanced to flank the elder chieftain on either side , but still they hesitated to lay hands on him . Hockingpomska was highly respected  --  both as a chief and as a rough fighting man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the belt of the nearest warrior . Before the warrior could preventit , the prisoner had pulled his tomahawk free . Then he gave the warrior a shove that sent him reeling to the floor . In the same motion he whirled around and sprawled the warrior on the other side in the same unceremonious manner . Facing Lawlewasikaw , he brandished the tomahawkhigh above his head and advanced slowly upon the startled Prophet , exclaiming : " Draw your tomahawk ! If you are such a mighty man , with power from Mandamon , surely you will not hesitate to match blows with a mere mortal who challenges you openly and mocks your claim of being sent by the Great Spirit ! " As Lawlewasikaw stood there , trembling with rage and uncertainty , the bold chieftain hurled his final defiance . " Draw your tomahawk , I tell you , and fight like a man ! We shall see if you are sent by Mandamon ! Draw , I dare you ! " But The Prophet did not draw ! Once again his bluff was called and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Instead , he bellowed forth a new commandto seize the prisoner : " Seize him , I command you , and take him to the stake ! He is worthy of death ! " A dozen or more guards finally responded to the call and quickly gathered around Hockingpomska , disarming him after a brief struggle and leading him from the longhouse . But it was not to the burning stake that they took him . Instead they returned him to his place of imprisonment . The Prophet 's failure , rather than Hockingpomska 's death , was assured when the challenge went unheeded . The hypnotic spell was broken . He never renewed his order to burn the dauntless chief , for his keen grasp of publicp210reaction informed him that he would not be obeyed . A few days later Hockingpomska was released from custody and the younger chiefs supporting The Prophet sought his counsel on matters concerning tribal government . The reign of terror was over ! The persecutions for witchcraft ceased . In the weeks that followed Lukenback and the Kluges closed their mission on White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their eastern headquartersat Bethlehem in Pennsylvania . The prospects of continued strife in the Indian country , plus the shock occasioned by the loss of Joshua and Billy Patterson , dictated their decision . In April , 1806 , the news of the Shawnee Prophet 's reign of terror among the Delawares on White River reached the ears of the Territorial Governor of Indiana , William Henry Harrison , at Vincennes . This was disturbing news because the peaceful attitude of the Delaware nation toward the United States government was one of the principaladvantages relied upon by the governor to control the red tribes of his wilderness domain . At once he called in his Territorial Secretary , John Gibson , who doubled as Secretary of State and Advisor to the Governor on Indian Affairs . " Horsehead " Gibson , as he was widely known on the frontier , was an old hand at dealing with the natives , having been in the forefront of land acquisition as a governmentnegotiator for over a quarter of a century . " Where are the Conners and how has this thing happened ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk in the north ground-floor office of his Grouseland residence . " Perhaps the reports are exaggerated , " Gibson suggested . " After all , we did have a report from John Conner of the wintering of the Shawnees at the White River towns.  |p211Although  he was concerned about The Prophet 's teachings , he was more concerned about Tecumseh 's warlike intentions . " " There are certain things that do n't add up , " Harrison said grimly . " How could this preaching medicine man make such inroads into Delaware thinking ? Where does Tecumseh fit into the picture ? Which one of these brothers is the dominant leader of the Shawnees ? " " I 'm afraid I ca n't answer any of those questions , Governor . I know I heard more of Tecumseh over in Ohio when I was at Fort Washington . I know you did , too ! " " True , " Harrison agreed . " There must be a great deal of natural leadership in both of these unusual Indians . Are they twins as I have often heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've heard those rumors , too , but the most reliable information I have is that Tecumseh is a few years older than Lawlewasikaw . Tecumseh , it is widely reported on the frontier , was trained by an older brother and fought beside him in several engagements . Their mother was a Creek woman , by the way . " " One could believe it is so , for you hear of Tecumseh traveling south to visit among the Creeks and Cherokees . You never hear of The Prophet traveling , do you ? He sits tight and waits for them to come to him . That 's one reason I sometimes suspect he may be the real power in this Shawnee brother act ! " " I never express an opinion when I do n't know  --  that 's the way I maintain a good average  --  but do n't sell Tecumseh short . He 's tremendous ! I 've heard him speak . But this Prophet  --  he 's an enigma as far as I am concerned . " Gibsonwas thoughtful for a few seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can assume that  --  and , I 'd guess , especially as a team ! " " Agreed , " Harrison nodded affirmatively . We must get in touch with both Conners for a full report as they see it from close up . " " We ca n't afford to lose the Delawares , that is certain ! Lose them and every Indian between here and the lakes will take up the tomahawk ! We 're too exposed in too many places . Those settlers are afraid of nothing ! " " Tell you what I 'm going to do  --  if you approve , ofp212course . I 'm going to try a direct appeal to the Delawares to bolster them up . What do you think of the idea ? " " Wo n't hurt anything . Might do a lot of good ! " That night Harrison sat up late in his study penning a personal message to the Delaware chiefs on the Wapihani . The next day it was dispatched by special courier up the Wabash and overland to the Wapihani towns . Five days later it arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its arrival was common knowledge among all the settlements . A council was called for the next day at Buckongehelistown to make known the contents of the letter , since it was addressed to all the Delawares . The Prophet , now making his headquarters among his own people at Shawneetown , was summoned to be present for the reading of the letter . Despite his recent downgrading , The Prophet was seated in a position of prominence . The fluent young chief from the lower settlements , the Beaver , was selected to read the communication . The Beaver was able to read and speak English , thanks to the efforts of the Moravians . The Beaver spoke loudly and clearly , as he translated Harrison 's letter : " MY CHILDREN : " My heart is filled with grief and my eyes are dissolved in tears at the news which has reached me . You have been celebrated for your wisdom above all the tribes of red people who inhabit this great island . Your fame as warriors has extended to the remotest nations , and the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandfathersfrom all the neighboring tribes ! From what cause , then , does it proceed , that you have departed from the wise counsels of your fathers , and covered yourselves with guilt ? " Not a person stirred around the huge circle as the Beaver voiced the words of the governor . Rapt attention was given him as he expressed Harrison 's alternate flowery tributes and stinging rebukes . " Who is this pretended Prophet who dares to speak in the name of The Great Creator ? " the Beaver read . Lawlewasikaw stiffened at these blunt words . He felt as if a tree had fallen upon him ! The hot anger that gripped him sent a paralyzing flash of pain through his brain . Instantly he controlled himself , forcing his stiffened body to relax , his eyes boring into the ground before him.  | " Examine him ! " the Beaver read . His voice seemed to come from a long way off . Indeed , it seemed like Harrison 's own voice was speaking the biting , sarcastic words : " Is he more wise or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected to convey to you the orders of your God ? Demand of him some proofs at least of his being the messenger of the Deity ! If God has really employed him , he has doubtless authorized him to perform some miracles , that he may be known and received as a Prophet . If he is really a Prophet , ask of him to cause the sun to stand still  --  the moon to alter its course  --  the rivers to cease to flow  --  or the dead to rise from their graves ! " " So that is Harrison 's game , " The Prophet told himself . " He hopes to destroy my influence with the tribes by maneuvering me into a hopeless position . Since when was a man of God , red or white , supposed to be able to do such things as that ? " He shifted his thoughts back to the Beaver and the letter of the governor . " If he does these things , you may then believe that he has been sent from God ! He tells you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who deal in magic , and that he is authorized to point them out . Wretched Delusion ! Is He , the Master of Life , obliged to employ mortal man to punish those who offend Him ? Has He not the thunder and all the powers of nature at His command ?  --  and could He not sweep away from the earth a whole nation with one motion of His arm ? My children , do not believe that the great and good Creator of mankind has directed you to destroy your own flesh ; and do not doubt but that , if you pursue this abominable wickedness , His vengeance will overtake and crush you ! " Without raising his head , Lawlewasikaw shot a fleeting glance around the circle of listeners . They were consideringthe argument of the letter and weighing its plausibility . The Prophet 's prestige had already vanished with the defianceof Hockingpomska . He would be given the opportunity to answer , if he could , the condemnations laid upon him . But now was the time to listen to the letter , not to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention back to the Beaver , a glimmer of hope arose in his resourceful brain . " This message , " the letter continued , " is addressed to you in the name of the Seventeen Fires . I now speak to you as a friend who wishes nothing more sincerely than to see you prosperous and happy . "  | " Oh , what a preposterous lie that is , " Lawlewasikaw thought , restraining the impulse to jump to his feet and denounce Harrison 's words as an attempt to divide the red people . But he must wait his turn . The Delawares would expect and demand that he do that . He swallowed hard , grunting contemptuously as Harrison pleaded with the Lenape chiefs . " Clear your eyes , I beseech you , from the mist which surrounds them . No longer be imposed upon by the arts of an imposter ! Drive him from your town and let peace and harmony once more prevail . Let your poor old men and women sleep in quietness , and banish from their minds the dreadful idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge you to stop your bloody career ; and if you wish the friendship of your great father , the President ; if you wish to preserve the good opinion of the Seventeen Fires , let me hear , by the return of the bearer , that you have determined to follow my advice . " As the letter ended no sounds of either approval or disapprovalof Harrison 's words were heard . All was quiet as every eye turned to The Prophet . The Lenape would neither convict nor absolve without giving an accused the chance to speak in his own defense . Certainly , one who claimed favor from the Great Spirit should have opportunity to meet such a challenge . Only the crackling wood fire ignored the unspoken admonition to await patiently The Prophet 's response to the white Father 's accusing letter . Lawlewasikaw once more was in a most uncomfortable position , and he knew it ! He had lost much prestige in the witchcraft trials . The burning of the Christian Delawareshad reacted against him . The letter from Harrison , therefore , could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many minds . Perhapsonly superstition had stayed them from taking retaliatoryaction against him . If he failed to meet this latest challenge , he was through ! Lawlewasikaw must speak and , moreover , act affirmatively to counteract the reverses piling up around him . His sharp mental processes worked like lightning , seeking a way to fling the governor 's challenge back into his teeth . This battle was being fought with weapons to Lawlewasikaw 's preference , that was one advantage , despite the seeming impossibility of the acts he was taunted to perform . The tongue , the mind , the emo/tions  --  these were weapons to which he was more adapted than guns , tomahawks , knives , or bare fists ! The phrase , " ask of him to cause the sun to stand still , " kept ringing through his mind . It struck a familiar chord . Had n't those Shaker missionaries back in Ohio told him of a total eclipse of the sun that was to occur in the near future ? They were the only white people who accorded Lawlewasikaw respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Great Spirit with sincerity . " Yes , they did mention it , " he told himself . " If I can only think of the date . Was it June 16 of this year  --  yes , that 's it ! Just a moon away , too ! The Great Spirit is with me , indeed ! Now , I 'll show Harrison who commands the confidence of the Delawares ! " Slowly , dramatically , the renowned Prophet arose and stepped into the fire-lighted circle . He glanced piercingly around the ring with his hawklike , one-eyed gaze . Finally he spoke , a hint of mysterious consequence in his voice . " My brothers , I have listened to these shameful charges against me and against my mission on the earth . Yet , it is not I who am shamed but he who so boldly wrote them . His insult is not against me , but against the Great Spirit who chose me as his messenger . " Standing there in the eerie glow of the firelight his gaze was as much on the blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every person felt that eye boring into him as it slowly traversed the circle . " This accursed white man challenges the will of the Great Master of Life ! It is strange , but there are those among his own red people who do not understand Mandamon'swill . May he grant forgiveness to those shortsighted ones ! But to the paleface dogs who drive the Great Spirit 's people off their own land and then rail against him and ridicule his messenger  --  he will show no mercy ! They will be destroyed with the evil manitous who cause them to deal so badly with the red people . " The father on the Wabash ridicules my authority to speak the will of Him who sent me . He says the Master of Life would not require his word to be given through me . Yet , three summers ago , Harrison told us that he spoke for our Great Father who lives in Heaven who made the earth for the comfort and happiness of His children ' ; fur/ther , that from the beginning He made it a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Then , he said there is nothing so pleasing to God above as to see His children employed in the cultivation of the earth . ' ApparentlyHarrison believes none knew the will of God but he himself ! " Hearken , my brothers , the White Father speaks truthfullywhen he suggests that the Master of Life could sweep from the earth a whole nation with one motion of his arm ! Hear this : one day soon he will sweep the whites out of the land of the red people ! The White Father challenges me to prove my powers from the Great Spirit . He names acts which I should be able to do if I am a messenger from Mandamon  --  things he well knows he nor any other living man can do ! He tells you to demand that I do such things , thinking I can not do them ! Wretched Delusion ' he says ! But he does not know with whom he is dealing ! Does he think Mandamon will leave me powerless in the face of his scornful challenges ? " Stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a magnificent gesture to the infinite realms of blackness above and thundered out his answer to Harrison : " White Father on the Wabash , I accept your challenge ! You say , cause the sun to stand still . ' I will do that ! I will do more than that ! He shall not only stand still , but I shall command him to hide his face from the earth and he will do that also ! And you , my red brothers , shall see what will happen ! " Shall not this be proof to the doubting palefaces on the Wabash that I am truly the messenger from the Great Spirit ? Will not our people be comforted in the knowledge that Mandamon 's protecting hand is spread over them and will they not cease to doubt us ? " A stir of excitement and murmur of approval swept through the crowd . Once more The Prophet had captured the imagination of the people with his bold and ostentatious assertions . If he could carry through on his breathtaking offer to prove by a miraculous deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost prestige restored . " Brothers , " he continued in his strange , mystery-laden voice , " on the sixteenth sun of the moon of flowers , I will perform this great miracle here on this spot  --  just as ourp218Father , the Sun , takes his highest position in the sky . Let all our people who would see this manifestation of the Great Spirit 's power be present on that occasion . I make but one requirement and that is that no whites  --  only Indians  --  bepresent ! Mighty Mandamon will not stoop to work his great power before the eyes of those who doubt and hold him up to scorn ! " From that moment the simple people of Wapihani anticipatedthe great day with eagerness . At last they would learn whether Temskwatawah was really the Great Open Door to the Happy Hunting Grounds and whether he spoke with the authority of the great and good Manitou ! " SOME SMALL CORNER OF THIS GREAT LAND ! " As the tragic events of the spring and early summer of 1806 on the Wapihani unfolded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling among the tribes in the northern lake country . Tecumseh would have constrained The Prophet from his rashness . Metamoris would have fought tenaciously against the youthful hotheads who were so quick to condemn their elders as witches . But they were reasoning with the Pottawatomisand the Miamis about the urgent need for union of the tribes . In every village Tecumseh preached the doctrine that the precious , dwindling forests belonged not to a single tribe , but to all ! " Therefore , " he asserted , " no part of it can be sold withoutthe consent of all ! " Everywhere this was his plea . The response of the Kickapoos and Winnebagoes in the Illinois country was most gratifying . Though small in numbers , these tribes were conceded to possess the bravest , hardiest warriors on the American continent . Likewise , the Pottawatomis , in the Lake Michigan area , received the organizers cordially and listened attentively . Even in the town of Winnemac , a chief noted for leanings toward Harrison , they were treated respectfully.  | " Harrison speaks with a forked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my youthful companion have found that is true . We Shawnees listened to his promises , and today we have no lands to call our own ! " Winnemac replied politely , but with firm determination not to commit himself to any pledge of participation in an anti-Harrison alignment of tribes . Farther west on the Illinois prairies the Sacs and Foxes were favorable to the plan and promised warrior support . But back in the northern Indiana territory , among the Miamis , the original owners of all the lands from the Great Lakes south to the Ohio , it was a different story . The Little Turtle , with his promising nephew , young Chief Richardville at his side , rejected stubbornly Tecumseh 's spirited plea for unity . The Little Turtle had made his peace with the United States at the Greenville treaty counciland he intended to keep it ! The Miamis , generally , listened to their head chief . The treatment on the upper Wabash and Mississinewa was civil but cold . The highest words of praise Tecumseh could employ to soften the veneratedMiami sagamore failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You gave the Indian people their two greatest victories against the Long Knives , Father , " Tecumseh offered generously . " As long as a red man lives and honors the traditionsof his fathers , your name will be spoken of with respect , so skillful was your leadership in those battles ! If you had led the battle at the Fallen Timbers I am convincedit would have been different there , too ! " " We had just as well try to stop the rivers from flowing , " answered the renowned chieftain sternly , " or to keep the rain from falling  --  or rebuke the west wind for blowing  --  as to attempt to stop the overflowing of the white men across the eastern mountains ! There is no end to their numbers or limit to the long-barreled rifles they aim westward . We made our peace after our defeat at the Fallen Timbers . We swore to keep that peace . I will be true to my word ! I will not raise the tomahawk again . " " The thoughts of men 's minds , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage of time , " Tecumseh observed in irony . " The Little Turtle is not thep220great lover of his people or the defender of their honor that once he was ! " The great Miami never wavered . Looking straight into the scathing gaze of the Shawnee , he replied in deliberate , calculated tones : " Sometimes it is good to die to benefit one 's people . Other times it is best to live and change . We both love our people , but we see our duty differently . Who knows ! Perhaps we are both right . The ways of the whites are like bitter medicine for a sick patient . The medicine tastes bad ; it is not pleasant to swallow ; it does not rest well in the stomach , yet it is the only way to regain health and life ! Our people must adopt the white manner of living ! " Metamoris was asked at this point by Tecumseh to join in the effort to persuade the Miami chief men to accept the confederation plea . In soothing tones and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shell . " There is much wisdom in the words of the renowned Little Turtle ! But do you think , my fathers , that your friendship with the Long Knife will avail you more than we received who attempted to be their friends in times past back east ? Even should they permit you to retain a small tract of ground for a farm , their evil ones will come and cheat you out of it by the use of firewater , games of chance , false debts , or by their so-called justice , which is for white men only ! Shall we not look to great Mandamon and trust that he will give us a lasting victory and reserve some small corner of this land for the use of the red man ? " Metamoris was answered by Richardville , in whose veins coursed not only the blood of Little Turtle 's line , but of high French nobility as well . " We have gained the friendship of the Seventeen Fires by being true to our commitments . We do not intend to lose it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to lose . Rather we intend to make that friendship stronger as time passes . We mean no disservice to our brothers and extend the hospitality of our town for as long as they care to remain . " It was with sorrowful hearts that the travelers departed from the land of the Miamis.  |p221The  fateful day arrived ! Indians flocked into Buckongehelistown from far and near  --  curious to see if The Prophet could live up to his bold claim to make the sun stand still and disappear from the daylight sky ! All morning long the daring Prophet preached fervently and powerfully  --  never pausing to rest . Occasionallyhe would glance at the beaming outline of the sun to check its progress up to the point of its rendezvous with the earth 's natural satellite . The crafty Prophet had even remembered the exact time of day the Shakers stated the sun would enter its eclipse . Finally that awful moment of suspense arrived ! The Prophet suddenly ceased his fervent preaching . All was tension-filled silence . Then Temskwatawah lifted his arms high toward the heavens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , as if he spoke in a language of another world . He ended his weird incantationsin a mystical , faraway voice : " Mighty Manitou , show your power ! " Even as he spoke a dark shadow crept slowly across the face of the sun . The Prophet stood solemnly and majesticallyas the sun 's bright glow faded , his arms outstretched in a beseeching , yet commanding manner . Darkness graduallysettled over the surface of the earth and the sun 's bright disk was entirely hidden behind the dark form of the moon . At noonday , dark night shadows settled ominouslyover the earth . Slowly Temskwatawah lowered his arms , but he continued to stand as in a trance , presenting an unearthly appearance there in the twilight darkness of noonday . Cold fear fell over the superstitious people . None moved , nor would they have dared if it had been possible . The frightened cries of little children were the only sounds that broke the dreadful stillness of the eerie midday night ! Then , once more , the spine-tingling voice of The Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behold , I have made the sun stand still  --  yes , I have done more . See , he hides his face from the eyes of the dwellers of the earth  --  this in obedience to my command ! The power of the Great Spirit is displayed before you ! "  |p222When  the sun was ready to emerge from behind the moon 's form , The Prophet once more raised his arms skyward , repeated his weird gibberish , and ended with the " other world " inflection to his voice . " Mighty Manitou , permit our Father , the Sun , to show his face to the children of the earth and to resume his journey into the land of the West Wind ! " Slowly and serenely , as if in answer to his bidding , the sun emerged from its temporary hiding , shining with all of its mid-June brilliance again . As The Prophet lowered his arms and turned his gleaming , triumphant features to the crowd , consternation broke loose ! Temskwatawah was completely vindicated . All were convinced that the Great Spirit had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again the loud-voiced one was riding the crest of his popularity  --  and he loved it ! At last , he felt his fame was secure and his destiny certain ! THE TIES THAT BIND ! The flames of witch hunting had died down to smoulderingembers by the time the travelers stepped off the trail at Buckongehelistown late in the September moon . That something was amiss they could readily discern . No words were needed to show that Lawlewasikaw had been up to his devilish work again . The unfolding of the whole tragic story of the burning of the witches brought the greatest strain yet on the personal relationship of Tecumseh and Metamoris . " Lawlewasikaw has gone too far ! " Metamoris contended stoutly . " His treachery and false claims must be refuted  --  for good ! " Tecumseh sat broodingly before the fire , his eyes staring into the flames , as Metamoris , crouched on one knee , bent forward toward him . " What would you have me do with him ? "  | " Let him eat of the same meat he fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you mean that ? " Tecumseh asked , with a piercing glance at his friend . Without blinking , Metamoris reversed himself , but in a forthright manner that allowed of no compromise . " No , but I believe he should be so disgraced that he will never dare raise up his head as a prophet before the red people again ! " For a time there was silence . Then Tecumseh spoke slowly . " What of your own tribesmen  --  chieftains and young men alike  --  who share his bad deeds ? Are they to escape responsibility , while only he is disgraced ? " When Metamoris failed to respond at once , he continued : " The very fact that he could influence an entire tribe to such infamous acts testifies to the remarkable abilities he possesses . Oh , I know he resorted to trickery and chicaneryin representing the eclipse of the sun as a manifestationof the Great Spirit 's power exercised at his behest ! It was a clever move  --  you 'll have to admit that . Harrison left himself wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eclipse occurred so conveniently ! Perhaps he has been imbued with spirit power that we do not share ! " " Has he beclouded even your head , Father , that you no longer distinguish between right and wrong ? " Metamoris asked in exasperation . Quick as a flash both men were on their feet , fiercely glaring into each other 's steel-hard eyes ! Metamoris felt no remorse or regret in this open defiance of the judgmentof his great friend . He would have confronted a thousand Tecumsehs just as readily  --  and Tecumseh knew it ! This was a man standing before him in whom he could see his own image clearly reflected . Slowly his eyes softened and slowly his strong hands grasped Metamoris ' shoulders as he spoke in a low , meaning-filled voice : " All right , my son , I will take Lawlewasikaw and my Shawnee people back to our Ohio homes . We will plague your Delaware towns no longer . Perhaps the damage is done here on the Wapihani . The Grandfathers may never join our confederation . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain here or go wherever they choose to roam throughout the land of the red people . Only this I know  --  whatever comes , Metamoris , son of my heart , you will be with me to the end  --  at least , until I releaseyou from the ties that bind our spirits together  --  always ! " Lapinabit was overjoyed when Metamoris walked into his town one pleasant late September day  --  and it was n't wholly because of the prospective match between the young chieftain and his eldest daughter , which had his blessing , either . The Prophet 's reign of terror had been experienced downriver , but not far enough to threaten his control of his own town , although it had occasioned him many anxious moments . The arrival of Metamoris meant that the danger from The Prophet was over . An enthusiastic welcome and celebration were in order . True to past performances , Metamoris , as he approached his favorite Wapihani town , found his heart matching the swift pace of his sprightly step . To the townsfolk he was no stranger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth of the town 's greeting compared to the always joyous reception on Wapinepay . Lapinabit 's beaming eyes outdid even the forthright gesture of his arms . After greeting the town 's male population , Metamoris was taken by the chief to his own lodge area . This was the moment he had been waiting for all summer  --  to be reunited with the captivating princess of Wapihani , solidly entrenched now as queen of his heart ! " Yanenowi will be pleased . So will our sons  --  and daughters , " Lapinabit suggested with increased emphasis , hardly regardable as an afterthought but as a subtle expression of pleasant anticipation . " Not even my own town and fireside affords more pleasure , Chief , than I feel here among your good people  --   |p225es|pecially  with your wonderful family ! " Metamoris endeavoredto match compliment for compliment , without direct reference to his love interest . After all , he had been away several moons ! Outside the main tepee they were met by a howl of enthusiastic welcome from the younger boys descending upon the scene . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , only waiting for the next opportunity to push forward . Metamoris greeted them pleasantly . " Have you big bear hunters bagged a lot of squirrels this summer ? " The optimistic reply he received broadened the smile on his face . This was the sign for a new assault upon the sturdy form of the popular visitor . With small fry hangingonto his arms and chatting excitedly up into his face , Metamoris rounded the side of the lodge just in time to catch a fleeting glimpse of a brown-clad female form glidinglike a shadow into an adjoining tepee . His heart skipped a beat ! It may have been Wynoma . Again , he might not have seen anyone at all , so fleeting was the view . Deep inside , though , he knew it was she , and thus his perplexitywas needless , though natural . His preoccupation was short-lived , as Yanenowi appeared , smiling broadly . " See what I have found , wife . " Lapinabit spoke goodnaturedly . " Your mind should be relieved now ! You 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " " Surely you jest , Father , " Metamoris spoke emphatically , " when you speak of witches and the mother of the Lenape in the same breath . My greetings to you , Mother ! " " Welcome , my son , " Yanenowi responded warmly . " Perhapsthe young chief could use some of Yanenowi 's food . He does n't look well fed , " she added , giving him an appraisinglook . " Come to think of it , I could at that ! " Beaming broadly , the chief 's wife whirled around towardthe smouldering fire . Metamoris watched the graceful , though plump and middle-aged figure stride to the fire where she busied herself with the large iron pot suspendedover the coals . Then he turned to his host , suddenly aware that Lapinabit was strangely quiet . He foundp226an expression of friendly amusement on the chief 's face  --  not smiling but not sober either . A strange light glowed in his eyes . " You know , Father , I feel as much at home in your town as in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Lapinabit failed to answer , he glanced sharply back again . The amused expression still occupied his host 's weather-beaten face . " I wonder what he finds so amusing , " Metamoris thought . Trying to pick up the conversation , he said : " I well remember the gracious hospitality I have received in your household in the past . " He looked away , still awaiting a reply that did n't come . Puzzled , he turned back to the chief , questioningly , only to meet with the same baffling expression . He had just opened his mouth to inquire frankly as to the chief 's peculiar conduct when he experienced an unusual sensation  --  asixth sense informing him that someone or something was close behind him ! It was not that he heard anything , for he had n't . It could have been a fleeting shadow or even an illusion . In the brief instant that followed , his wilderness survival instinct informed him clearly of the presence of a living being close at hand . By impulse , he whirled around , his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he completed the swift maneuver he gave a decided grunt of surprise , for at that moment his waist was encircled by a pair of delicate brownskinnedarms . The result was that he found himself held tightly within the grasp of a startled Wynoma and looking straight into her wide eyes . Neither moved . They remained there in the other 's arms , staring straight into each other 's eyes ! A hearty guffaw from Lapinabit broke the spell and the surprised lovers joined in the laughter in which Lapinabit was merrily indulginghimself as he slapped his leg , rocking back and forth on his heels . " If an enemy slips up on you as easily as does a mischievousmaiden , you are a careless warrior , " Lapinabit observed lightly ! " Mischievous is the proper word , Father . But who hears the spirit of the summer steal across the land , or who hears the moon rise silently over the eastern hills ? " askedp227Metamoris , continuing to feast his eyes on the fair form of the sprightly maiden who belatedly moved a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up above the hills and find herself in the arms of a strong and handsome warrior ? " Wynoma 's eyes spoke almost as fluently as her soft voice . " The moon could never be such a lovely armful , " he countered . " Nor could she ever be happier than I am now to see my brave warrior from Wapinepay . We 've missed you  --  very much ! Have n't we , Father ? " " Of course , of course , " Lapinabit added good-naturedly . " We 've missed you very much ! By the way , now that you 're here , let us celebrate ! Yanenowi has the food ready . Let us make a feast in honor of a glad reunion ! " The days that followed contained golden moments for the youthful Lenape lovers . They were quiet days of peacefulvillage life and seasonal pursuits  --  just now concerned with reaping the bountiful autumn harvest . The tribal appetites must be satisfied through the coming winter , regardless of its length or severity . Women and men both shared in the harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled the gathering of the fruits of the summer crops while the men provided current meat supplies , plus extra quantities to be cured and preserved for the winter moons when the game would not be prowlingtheir usual haunts , but would be hidden away , sheltered from the north wind 's icy blasts and chilling snows ! The visit Metamoris intended for a few days stretched into weeks . Shortly after his arrival in Sarah Town the moon of falling leaves , September , had grown old and , without a change in the weather , except for the coloring of the leaves , disappeared into the realm of forgotten yesterdays . The October harvest moon , the moon of dryp228grasses , came into its infancy . The hours and days passed swiftly and serenely . They were pleasant and mild . The sleeps were good , with lots of moon and lots of time for love 's young dreams to assert their powerful influence over the lives of the maturing youths and blossoming maidens of the village . Metamoris did n't miss his opportunities to enter into the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corn harvesting he joined eagerly in the joyful maize dance celebration . Young men and maidens danced around the great fire on three successivenights of celebrating . A jovial atmosphere pervadedthe scene and caught up the population in its lightheartedspirit . " There are other young men here who have eyes for the fair Wynoma , " Metamoris suggested to her wryly , as they danced the symbolic steps of the maize dance and had come together for an instant . No opportunity for answering presented itself just then , but when they were near enough to converse again briefly Wynoma replied , " I had n't supposed you noticed , for I saw you were watchingthe other maidens who are far more lovely than I ! " Before he could retort she was away and concentrating her attention on the striking figure of the Beaver , who was visiting from his own neighboring village and , while interested in all the fairer sex of Sarah Town , had especial eyes for the princess . Metamoris had n't seen Tamaqua since the Wapinepay council , but , recalling the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitorof real merit  --  one who could appeal to maidenly fancy . " Is he the favored suitor when there are no visitors around ? " he asked , when the occasion arose . Wynoma smiled teasingly , and before he was out of range she voiced a low and taunting reply , " Is n't he hand-some ? " With that she was lost among the other dancers . Metamoris decided to give her the same teasing medicinehe was receiving . He turned his attention to an attractive maiden who had been frequently and convenientlynear him in the dance . In the dark she might easily have been mistaken for Wynoma . He returned her smile . By a slight nod and motion of his head he guided herp229away from the fire circle into the shadows only a few yards back from the cavorting dancers . It was hardly an uncommon sight to see couples dropping out of the festivitiesand drifting off where the opportunity for more secluded wooing existed . " What 's your name , little one ? " he asked . " If I were Wynoma you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked laughingly . " Say , now , I have found another sharp-witted maiden on the Wapihani . Are you all that way up here ? " " Perhaps , " she replied , giggling . " But we 're not all daughters of the chief of the town . " " I see . Well , now , fair one  --  do you like that better ? What is your name ? " " I am Wild Rose . If I were as lovely as the rose , I would be as wild  --  if the right young man came along ! " " I believe you would , at that . " " Do n't worry , I wo n't bite you , because I know you wo n't stand still to be bitten . I 'm glad you changed from Little One ' to Fair One '  --  even though I know you do n't mean it . " " Why do you say that ? " " The young chief from far off has eyes only for the beautiful princess . He has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who said this little wild rose is plain ? Not I ! I say she is fair . Besides , the beauty in the face and in the heart is what speaks , not the fact of being a chief 's daughter . Is it not so ? " " Perhaps . But even by that standard , Wynoma is the fairest of this town . Face , body , or spirit , she is more beautiful than any other . You love her very much , do n't you ? " " I do n't hide it very well , do I  --  even when I try ? " " Does the squirrel hide his presence in the top of the hickory tree when he is cutting on the nut ? Neither does Metamoris hide the reason for his presence in our village . " " Who is the warrior she dances by ? " His voice was as casual as he could make it . " I knew you would ask me that question . It is for that reason you brought me out here , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncanny ability of the female sex to see through the subtlest ruses of men.  |p230Indeed  , he reflected , men 's ways must seem very clumsy to women . " Partly , I suppose  --  although I already know who he is . The other reason would be even less noble ! " Wild Rose smiled as she answered : " I 'm sure you succeededwell with that . Wynoma probably watched us leave the firelight and is most envious by this time . I 'll tell you one thing you will be glad to know ! Tamaqua also seeks a wife and his interest and yours could conflict ! " " Tell me , little fair one who knows so much , is he  --  I mean  --  has he --  ? " The question was not finished . " No , he has never wooed Wynoma . That 's what you are trying to ask , is it not ? " She smiled knowingly up into his face in the moonlight . " That 's good ! " The reply was almost instinctive . " Now that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're ready to take me back to the fire circle and the dancing ? " " I think it would be well if we did . We 've been gone for some time , have n't we , " he replied with a smile . As they walked the short distance back to the lighted area , Wild Rose looked up at Metamoris with a piercing smile , saying softly , " She is a fortunate maiden ! " " The wise young man who gets this little wild rose will be just as fortunate as I hope to be . " As he spoke he squeezed her arm fondly . Harvesting the wild rice was a new experience to Metamoris . This grain did not grow along his native Wapinepay , or , indeed , on the Wapihani , except here on the swampy marshes lying around the big bend in the Wapihani'ssouthwesterly course . The toiling sex provided the manual labor in gathering the prized rice crop . Metamoris had a double purpose in joining the harvesting activities.  |p231First  , he was learning something new , and second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and that was the way he wished to spend the fleeting days he had allotted himself on this visit . The women chuckled with glee when they saw the young chieftain in the boat , or wading in the water pulling the tender shoots . " Last time he was here he captured a maiden instead of a deer or a bear , " one young woman recalled amid an avalanche of laughter . When the merriment died down , the sharp-witted one added : " This time the maiden captureshim and puts him to work pulling rice shoots ! " A greater uproar than before greeted this choice comment . Up and down the rows of harvesters the humorous remarksat Metamoris ' expense were repeated . " That 's the way to train your future husband , girls , " another suggested , " then you can quit working after you 're married ! " The youthful chieftain accepted the banter in stride , answering the jibes with humorous witticisms of his own . " You poor women on Wapihani are sure to be pitied ! Why , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We contend that women were created to look beautiful and make their husbands happy by their charm and beauty ! Working would make their faces wrinkled and put callouses on their pretty , smooth hands . Women were made for love , not work ! " A furious howl went up on every hand ! With feigned indignation they splashed water at him and hooted in mock derision . " Why did you come to Wapihani to woo a maiden , then ? " a half dozen asked in the same breath . " They would n't have me down there . They say I do n't stay home enough to work for them . They said I 'd have to come up here and get a girl who is n't so beautiful and one who will work for me ! " That sent water , mud , and everything else loose whistlingin his direction and tongues wagging all over the place . The younger women feigned intense anger , while the older women scarcely concealed their merriment , watching the affair with great interest . " Is that the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's work , squaw man ? " another asked derisively . " That 's right , " Metamoris answered with casual unconcern . " We do the women 's work for them down there and tell them to busy themselves keeping their faces and hands beautiful ! Too bad you girls ca n't be beautiful like they are ! " That did it ! The Wapihani maidens could take no more . In desperation they turned to Wynoma . " Did you hear him , Wynoma ? Did you hear that man ? " She was working out of the same boat Metamoris was helping load and , while listening intently to everything that was said , was busily engaged in her task . " Yes , I heard him , " she replied casually . " But did you hear him say that the maidens on Wapinepayare more beautiful than you ? Did you hear that , daughter of the chief ? " " Yes , I heard that , too ! " she replied nonchalantly , an amused note in her voice . " The maidens do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what he said all right , " she answered with a smile . " They 're not supposed to make their hands rough or mar their beauty , he says . Did you hear that ? " " He did say that , " she answered complacently . " But did you hear him say he seeks a wife up here who is not so beautiful and one who will work hard ? " " Did he say that ? " she asked in pretended anger . " Yes , yes , that 's what he said ! " they all shouted excitedly . " Now , what do you say , Wynoma ? Can you love a man like that ? " " I say that if he seeks a wife who is not so beautiful and one who will work , then I could fit his need very well ! Could n't you love a man who would marry you even though you were n't beautiful ? " " But you are the most beautiful among us , our princess , " one cried in exasperation , voicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak thus . Are you not at least angry with him ? " Her eyes sparkled as she raised up from her work to reply : " You forget , girls , I was down there at his townp233on the Wapinepay . I saw the maidens down there and I know what they 're like without words from him . " " Tell us , tell us ! " they all screamed . " Perhaps , then , he will cease his boasting . " " Indeed , it is true , everything he says . The maidens are very beautiful down there and I never saw one of them work while I was there ! " A groan swept through the assemblage of female rice gatherers . Their disappointment was genuine . For a long period there was no further comment  --  just sloshing in the wet marshes as the wild rice shoots were pulled and placed in the canoes . Metamoris knew better than to make any further caustic comment  --  just at this time . In water too deep for wading the women worked from the canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canoes and , with the other hand , used a stick to beat the tops of the long grasses into the canoes . When their own canoe was filled , Metamoris and Wynoma waded and pushed it in to higher ground where rude rack frames , covered with dry grass , were set up to facilitate the drying of the grain . They bailed the grain out of the canoe and spread it on the racks . Here , the Sun Father , aided by fires kindled beneath the racks , would cure and dry the precious grains in two or three days ' time . During both the corn and wild-rice harvesting , all the available female power of the town was drafted into the operations . Every morning and evening anxious eyes scanned the western horizon for signs of thunderheads that might indicate a visit from the rain people . In fact , many simple prayers went up that very day to the Great Manitou to hold off the rains until the harvesting was completed . Nor did the people fail to thank the Manitou for staying the rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain . Yanenowi worked close by and , like many other workers , had her youngest offspring securely strapped to a baby board , which in turn was strapped to her back . The baby board was flat and oblong , with a deerskin bag tied to it . A rawhide string laced the bag up the front to secure its juvenile inhabitant inside . Part of the time , Yanenowi leaned the baby board , baby enclosed , against a tree in a shady spot . Smaller girls were placed in charge of this " sitting " responsibility . Sometimes Yanenowi hungp234the baby board from a low bough of a tree . There , baby , cozily snuggled inside the deerskin bag and protected by the grass and moss interlining it , was swung gently to and fro by the breezes . The small girls sang a lilting melody to the wee ones that was similar to its counterpartused by white mothers a few miles eastward . During the remaining days of his visit at the Sarah Town , Metamoris divided his time between daylight huntingexcursions with the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silvery moonlight nights they strolled along the river 's edge and up the trail to the secluded glen which housed the " dreaming pool . " This was the moon of harvest and dry grasses and the Wapihani was at its loveliest , while the October moon beamed down upon the current crop of redskin lovers with her nostalgicencouragement . Wynoma and her brave sat together nightly overlooking the gleaming , drifting waters of the river . As they sat they talked and wooed and dreamed together , his arm wrapped possessively around her small figure , her head nestled contentedly against his strong shoulder . " When will our time come , Metamoris ? " she asked , as the golden hours sped swiftly by . " Perhaps when I come to Wapihani again  --  maybe anotheryear , or two . I do not know , my fair one . It will be as soon as I can take a wife and properly provide for her in my own lodge . " " You know , my lover , that I will wait here for you patiently , married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , I know that . But I have pride , my princess . I am a chief ! I must take my wife from her father 's home and provide for her as a chief will always do ! " " The moon and I  --  and Wapihani  --  will be waitingp235anxiously for your next visit , Metamoris . Hurry back  --  soon ! " " I will never leave you in spirit , my pretty one ! " If the moon smiled at that moment and if Wapihani and her passionate lovers responded in kind , the whole process would have been quite natural . For if the moon 's mysterious glow can stir and drive the tides of the mighty ocean , then what momentous tides must her tug and pull upon the heartstrings of the children of the earth inevitably bring forth in their season ! " Metamoris , " Tecumseh exclaimed upon his young friend 's return to the Shawneetown , " Lawlewasikaw is leaving at once for a visit to the lower Wabash to confer with Harrison , who recently sent him an invitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure the governor of our peaceful intentions . I am going west to establish a new town near the mouth of the Tippecanoe on the upper Wabash ! " " Why do you not go to Harrison yourself and send Lawlewasikaw to establish the town on the Tippecanoe ? " Metamoris asked bluntly . " Harrison regards Lawlewasikaw as the leader of our movement . That is good . They will deal with me in time . Meanwhile , I desire that they know little of my activities . " " You can not trust Lawlewasikaw at the governor 's head-quarters . " " Oh , I think I can . You see , I 'm sending you along to watch him . Your presence will be a staying influence upon his rashness . " " How do you know I will go ? " " I do n't question that for a moment ! You are my strong right arm . You will follow my instructions . " " You have more faith in me than I have in myself , where Lawlewasikaw is concerned . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to your counsel . But if you fail to change my thinking , I shall expect you to go ! " Thereafter , Metamoris ' strongest counsel failed to shake Tecumseh 's determination to proceed with his plan . Lawlewasikawwas hardly less pleased to have the Delaware in his party . Yet the strong will of Tecumseh prevailed and The Prophet was reconciled on the grounds that Metamoriswas not to interfere or participate in the negotiationsunless he himself exceeded or departed from the course Tecumseh outlined for him . " The Delaware is my eyes on this trip , " Tecumseh told his brother plainly . " Do you understand ? " " I understand . " Lawlewasikaw replied in unconcealed displeasure . " If you do or say other than as I have told you , you will answer to me ! Do you understand that , too , Lawle-wasikaw ? " " You make yourself plain , Brother , " The Prophet replied haughtily , as he shot a hateful look at Metamoris , standingquietly by . " I will instruct the braves who accompany you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whites , they are to place themselves under Metamoris ' command rather than yours . Is that clear , also ? " " Quite clear ! " the one-eyed one replied , as he whirled around and stalked fiercely away . " IF I AM GOD , I SHOULD NOT STEAL HORSES , YOU SAID ! " The trip down the Wapihani to its convergence with the Wabash and then upstream a half day 's journey to Vincennes was made without incident . Metamoris gazed longingly at the Sarah Town and the group of townspeoplegathered on the banks there as they floated by . He felt genuinely relieved when he did not see Wynoma'sp237slim figure in the crowd , although his heart tried several energetic flip-flops during the few trying moments it took his canoe to glide by the town . He gave Lawlewasikaw a wide berth during the four-day journey . This was n't difficult , since The Prophet found it convenient to avoid him . Upon arrival at Vincennes , the party made camp in a grove a little way northeast of the log-cabin territorial capitol and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's program began to unfold shortly after the arrival in the white town . He called all of his party together and delivered a powerful sermon on the folly of drinking the white man 's firewater . The following day a conference was held with Governor Harrison in the council room of the mansion . Many officialsof his government were present . Metamoris noted that Harrison was taking no chances . An entire company of militiamen was encamped on the commons east of the mansion and several armed men were standing in the assemblage gathered in the council chamber , nonchalantly leaning on their rifles . After perfunctory greetings , the governor indicated his intention for The Prophet to speak . " Father , " Lawlewasikaw began in a soft , unusually humble voice , " it is three years since I first began with that system of religion which I now practice . Then , both white people and Indians were against me ; but they had no need for fear . I had no other intention but to introduceamong the Indians those good principles of religion which the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproached by the whites for misleading the Indians . " Here he raised his voice in righteous indignation . " But I defy them to say that I did anything amiss ! " Governor Harrison sat quietly at his council table , his keen eyes boring deeply into the strange figure of the oneeyedProphet with his black patch trademark displayed so prominently across his features . He drank in every word . Metamoris was wedged into a corner of the room among several Shawnees . " Father , I was told that you intended to hang me . When I heard this , I intended to remember it , and tell my father of it when I went to see him and relate to him the truth . I heard , when I came to the Wabash country , that my father , the governor , had declared that all the land betweenp238Vincennes and Fort Wayne was the property of the SeventeenFires . I also heard that you wanted to know , my father , whether I was God or man and that you said , if I was the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Indian agent , Mr. Wells , but I believe it originatedwith himself . " The Prophet was a picture of humility , without guile and sincerely desirous of convincing the governor of his good faith . Metamoris found himself amazed at the commonsense Lawlewasikaw was injecting into his expressions . Never had he heard him speak like this before . Small wonder the whites had been fooled about who was the real power behind the Shawnee opposition . He listenedattentively as The Prophet 's discourse continued . " The Great Spirit told me to tell the Indians that he had made them and the world  --  that he placed them in it to do good and not evil ! I told all the redskins that the way they were in was not good , and that they ought to abandon it ; that we ought to consider ourselves as one man , but we ought to live agreeable to our several customs , the red people after their mode and the white people after theirs ; particularly , that they should not drink whiskey , that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who alone know how to use it ; and that it is the cause of all the mischiefs which the Indians suffer . I told them that they must always follow the directions of the Great Spirit and must listen to him , as it was he who made us ! " From here , Lawlewasikaw related to the governor how he was warning the red tribes not to listen to the British in Canada , or take up the tomahawk offered by them . He told his red brothers , he said , to " cultivate the ground and learn to live after the pattern of the white people . " This , of course , was an out and out lie and Metamoris felt himself straining to leap forward and expose The Prophet for his fraud . It was now apparent that the former good words had been merely a blind to cover his real intention to deceive and mislead the governor . A wave of hopeless bitterness swept over Metamoris as he listened to **27;5314;TOOLONG . " I now inform you that it is our intention to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call the Great Spirit to witness the truth of my declaration . "  | " How can he make the Great Spirit a part of his schemingtrickery ? " Metamoris asked himself in silent dismay . The speech then closed with a mild , veiled warning that the new religion of The Prophet had united the people to a determination to stand together against any further land sales . Finally , he voiced a strong appeal for whites and Indians to live side by side in peace and natural trust . Governor Harrison , obviously , was impressed ! He was cautious , however , in his short , formal answer , not to committhe government to any unwise course . " The Great White Father in Washington , " he said , " will be pleased to learn that his red children are anxious to live in peace and sobriety . Surely this course will be productive of much happiness for Indians and whites alike . " Without further intercourse he retired to his living quarters . As Metamoris returned to the campsite north of Grouselandhe noticed a mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . Drawing near , he was able to get the gist of it . " Go on , take it , " one of the soldiers was saying , " it 's free . There 's plenty more where this came from . " As the fellow spoke he shoved a jug of whiskey at the nearest brave . The Indian made no effort to accept the jug , but shook his head determinedly . The soldier received no more encouragement from the other three redskins in the group . Each refused the offer of the whiskey . " What 's the matter with you Injuns ? " the soldier asked incredulously . " Never saw one a ' ya turn down whiskey afore ! How about you , young feller ? " he asked , as he spied Metamoris standing off a few paces . " Have a little drink , wo n't cha ? " Metamoris walked forward toward the party without speaking . Thinking that at last he had found a taker , the soldier grinned broadly and extended the keg to the approachingwarrior . Metamoris extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man 's grasp . Noting that the plug was already pulled , he unhesitatingly turned the jug upside down and started pouring the contents onto the ground ! " What in tarnation you think you 're doin ' ? You plumb crazy ? " shouted the soldier . " Give me that jug . " So saying , he made a grab for the vessel . His hands met onlyp240thin air . Instead , he suddenly felt himself propelled backwardto the ground as Metamoris ' strong right arm shoved him swiftly and forcefully away . For a moment it appeared there might be violence , but as the four Indians present gathered quickly around Metamoris , the surprised soldier and his two companions retired swiftly in the direction of the mansion . The report the white soldiers took to Harrison , though more dramatic than similar reports brought in to the governor , nevertheless coincided with the others . The Indians , without exception , refused the firewater Harrison had purposelymade available to them as a test of the sincerity and effectiveness of The Prophet 's preaching . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penned a letter to the Secretary of War in Washington describing his test and expressing admiration for the Shawnee Prophet 's astonishinginfluence over the minds of his followers . " I can not say , sir , how successful he may be in persuadingthem to lay aside their passion for war , but the experimentmade to determine whether their refusal to drink whiskey proceeded from principle or was only empty profession , established the former beyond all doubt . " Leaving Lawlewasikaw 's party a short distance upstream from Vincennes on the return journey , Metamoris struck out eastward overland for Wapinepay and home . A half day 's distance above Metamoristown he stopped for a short visit with Killbuck , at his village in the hill country west of the river . In a small clearing surrounded on all sides by huge trees , a dozen or so tepees were scattered about . The rough-and-tumble old chief , who had seen fifty-eight or sixty winters come and go , was engaged in a knifethrowingcontest with a group of sprouting teen-age warriorswhen Metamoris arrived . Despite his handicap ofp241shortness , Killbuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he possessed great ability and self-confidence  --  two indispensible attributes for leadership on the frontier . The game broke up temporarily as the entire settlement turned out to greet the visitor , a familiar figure in their midst , since their village was little more than an outpost for Metamoris ' larger settlement a short distance downstream . The greetings over , the contest was renewed and Metamoris invited to join in the competition . Killbuck had demonstrated to the boys with what accuracy the dangeroushunting knife could be thrown . None could come close to his expert tosses . Metamoris was quickly drafted and found himself hard pressed to match the skill of the wily old woodsman . Most of the villagers formed around the range , watching intently as the knives flew through the air at leaf targets on the side of a large oak tree . The spectators waxed enthusiastic as accurate throws were made . But as each man prepared to cast his knife , silence reigned , so that the thrower would not be distracted . Youth and a slightly steadier hand finally prevailed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire that night , Metamoris related all the experiences that had been his during the past year . The villagers listened with interest . The short bloody reign of The Prophet on the Wapihani brought the greatest reaction . Divided opinions were expressed concerning The Prophet and his teachings . As in other tribal gatherings Lawlewasikaw was much discussed . Everywhere he was a stormy and controversial figure . From Killbuck Metamoris learned the disturbing and painful news that the game supply of the valley had taken a decided turn for the worse . If prospects did n't improve , he was told , the towns would have to move westward to higher ground . In fact , many took a dim view of the winterfood situation , especially if it should be an exceptionallycold season . The blame was placed squarely upon the presence of the white settlers along the treaty line a scant six miles east of Metamoristown . They were felling trees and clearing brush like mad ! Huge smoke clouds had been viewed all fall on the eastern horizon . The game was in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west fork either . Oh , there was plenty ofp242small game like squirrels and rabbits , and plenty of furbearinganimals to trap yet . But the vital deer supply was diminishing rapidly , and bears were seldom seen . " To remain here during the winter moons is to invite the hunger spirits , " Killbuck informed Metamoris . " But to leave the valley is to invite the paleface squattersto cross the line and lay claim to our lands , " Metamoriscountered . " What do you counsel , then ? " " Our people will not suffer for lack of food ! We will remain here ! " " Where will you find the deer , brother ? " Killbuck asked . " We will find them where they are ! " " Then you must have your snowshoes well strung and taut . You must be prepared to sleep on the deep snow blanket that will cover the earth . All the signs point to a cold winter . " " That is what we will do , " Metamoris responded determinedly . " Are we weaklings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the white faces of the Yankwis settlers frighten us from our lands ? No , brothers , we shall not leave the valley  --  nor shall we hunger ! There are still fish in the river ! We can break the ice and take them . There are squirrels in the den trees . We can poke them out . There are rabbits and quail and grouse for the taking  --  if we apply ourselves . Besides , if we travel south and west we shall find a few deer and an occasional bear . Our young men have not lost their ability to track the animals , or their steady aim , I think . If we must hunt harder and longer and farther away  --  that is what we shall do ! Our people shall eat this winter  --  and next , too ! " " Well spoken ! " Killbuck said , after grunting enthusiastically . " My heart is filled with gladness to hear you speak thus , for that is my own sentiment . If the land robbers drive me from this valley they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they must shoot me down in my tracks and bury me in this good earth . Even though the land is sold and all my people leave , I will return here . This is my home and here I will stay ! " A round of " ughs " and " grunts " of approval followed these defiant words . Metamoris felt a strange sensation of coldness creep slowly up his spine as he heard thep243solemn pledge . He glanced sharply at the chief 's determined countenance . As he did , the old feeling of melancholia and gloom settled over him . For a flashing instant he saw before his eyes a scene that made him sick all over . He shook his head , as if to dislodge a bad dream . The vision was gone as swiftly as it had flashed into his mind , but it left a haunting memory that would last for many a day  --  and sleepless night ! Proceeding on to his own town , Metamoris crossed the Wapinepay at a familiar riffle . Cutting straight overland eastward to the headwaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The creek trail was no shorter than the main trail down the river , but it enabled him to visit the lodge of Standturk before entering the town . It was gratifying to find his subordinate chief at home , and the reunion of the friends was warm and heartfelt . The light in their eyes , their eager embrace , testified to the strong bond between them . " Welcome home , my brother ! " Jack exclaimed happily . " The sight of you is good ! The people grow restless in your long absence . " " It 's good to see you , Jack ! How is it with my brother and his family ? The children appear lively enough ! " By this time the youngsters were swarming around their visitor  --  all smiles and anxious to be individually greeted by him . " They 're well  --  as you see . " " What about the people , Jack ? " There was concern in his voice . " Anxious for the return of their chief before the wintersnows come ! Otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Craw Fish and Silver Eagle 's papoose  --  fever . "  | " I grieve with Silver Eagle ! Craw Fish had a long and good life  --  there is no regret . What of Grandmother ? " " She is well . " " I am eager to move on down the trail before the sun goes down . " " Not before we start the celebration with some of Bright Star 's squirrel stew . How about it ? We 've got some choice venison here , too ! " " I can not refuse . Do n't ever let those white people get a taste of Bright Star 's squirrel stew , my friend . If you do , you 'll have them over here sooner than you want them ! " Jack appreciated the humor , Bright Star the compliment ! She scurried about the fire preparing the meal . As they ate , they discussed the tense border situation . " I tell you , Metamoris , it 's becoming serious ! The settlersare a real threat . Every day we see the smoke from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods hunting the game . Deer , bear , and other animals are frightened away . Seldom do our hunters hunt east of here  --  it 's no use . Soon we will be forced to leave the valley ! " " I wish I could at least assure you that there will be no crossing of the boundary line  --  but I can not , " Metamoris told him gravely . " You 're right , Jack , it is serious  --  very serious ! " " Do you think we ought to move west sooner  --  than later ? It might be wise . " " No  --  no , we must stay here  --  if we can find the game . To pull out now would but be to invite them to cross and lay claim to the land . They must be stopped somewhere and the Greenville line is the place to do it ! There will always be border problems somewhere . " " What you say , my chief , I will do  --  so will the people  --  even if it means death ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Jack . I shall try to deserve it ! " Later in the day , Grandmother , though less demonstrative , was even happier to feast her tired old eyes on her precious Metamoris . This was the greatest thrill in life for her . " My son , my son ! " she spoke in faltering voice . Shep245could go no further , for , after all , there was nothing more to say . " I 'm home for the winter , Grandmother , " he replied with a smile , placing his strong hands tenderly on her withered shoulders . " I shall care for you well through the cold moons . You will be warm and fat this winter . I will see to that ! " His eyes sparkled merrily as he labored to fight back the tears that so frequently sought to unmaskhis sentimental being . Later the old woman found her voice , as she did often during the long winter days that followed , to pour out the question of haunting fear gripping all the townspeople : " How long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A long time  --  I hope , " he replied . After a prolonged silence , he added , " At worst , one , two , three more seasons  --  not over that , unless  --  well , the lack of game is a greater threat than the white men ! But we must not speak in these words to the people , Grandmother ! " " I understand , Son . But if we move will we go to Wapihanior to Mahoning or " Her quaking voice hesitatedas if she dreaded to speak of the other alternative . All the heartbreak and humiliation she felt in the prospect of another uprooting from a land that had become home to old and young alike was vividly apparent to Metamoris , who winced as he recognized the old sadness . Twice before , Grandmother , in her long and eventful lifetime , had been through this awful experience . She was far too old to endure such an ordeal again . It would mean the end  --  even as it would for many younger and heartier souls than Grandmother . " Mahoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be  --  on further , " he stated forthrightly . " Beyond the Great River ? " It was a request for confirmation , rather than a question . " Many young men will fall here in the great forests before that move is made , " Metamoris predicted , momentarilydropping his usual resolve to spare the dear old one as much worry as possible . " I will not make that trip , my son ! I would not want to ! My husband lies here  --  my children ! I want to remainp246here , too ! If our young men must die here fighting I know the Great Spirit will expect no more from me ! " " Hush , my dear grandmother ! You must not speak of dying until Mandamon beckons . " " You are young , my son . You know not the visions and spirit yearnings of age . I have heard voices and I have seen the beckoning hand from the other side . The time is near and I am ready . " " Tonight you are tired , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and moving west . You must sleep now . The sleep spirits will remove the disturbing thoughts from your dear head . We must live today and enjoy the blessings that are ours . Tomorrow will come soon enough and then we will face the battles that must be fought . " " Of course , my child , of course , " she replied in a low , tired voice . Then she paddled slowly out of the tent withoutturning her tear-stained face toward him . With Standturk at his side and other hunters moving warily along on his right and left , Metamoris ranged far and wide that winter , hunting with all the skill and resourcefulnessnative to his people . The game was scarce , the hunting hard , the weather cold and bitter , but the viIlageate and no infant voice wailed because of the gnawingpangs of the hunger spirits . The meat was there for all to share according to the need . Without meat the milk would not flow and the newly born ones would cry and waste away and die ! Nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glow of health from the younger adults or make gaunt and pale the countenancesof those who had seen many winters come and go . By the time the sap started running in the huge maple woods a short distance north of town , the feeling of restlessnessreturned and the call of the distant trails came louder and with mounting frequency each day . Winter had definitely broken ! Other signs of spring also appeared on schedule . The food crisis was over . With spring would come new and welcome sources of nourishing foods . One day Metamoris silently glided into the forest and struck out overland on the familiar Wapihani trail . Jack Standturk , as usual , remained behind.  |p247It  was early March when Metamoris arrived at the Sarah Town for the few days only he could visit there before making the long trek eastward to join Tecumseh at Greenville . True to his word , Tecumseh had left Wapihaniand returned to Ohio with The Prophet and all their followers . Wynoma was radiant ! In fact , she seemed more charming , vibrant , and mischievousthan usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthralled by her unexpected behavior and bewitchingloveliness . An air of mystery accompanied her captivating form as she moved gracefully about . " Now , what strange storm is shaping up in that cute little head ? " he thought , as he watched her bounce back and forth to the fire , humming an old Lenape love song . Although she paid him little of the attention of previous visits , yet her exuberance of spirit showed plainly the pleasant satisfaction his arrival had occasioned in her heart . She appeared to be playing the age-old , tantalizing game of " I know something you do n't know  --  and would n't you like to know , though ! " " She 's cooking up a surprise of some kind , " he assured himself . " There 's no mistake about that ! " Following closely in the wake of a rainstorm blowing up the day before Metamoris ' arrival in town , an unseasonablycold snap kept the townspeople largely confined to their huts and wigwams , while the icy fingers of the northwestwind held sway across the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities and spirits of the people generally , Wynoma , in contrast , still exhibited a demeanor of happy contentment and vivid anticipation  --  asort of smug , tongue-in-cheek attitude of " Just wait and see  --  oh , you 'll be surprised when it comes ! " Metamoris knew that whatever was responsible for this strangeness so usual to her nature , yet unexpected in its manifestation , it would come soon ! When it did , he would be shocked , he knew . He was right ! It did come soon and he was shocked . On his third day in town the tantalizing maiden ap/proached him and announced bluntly , but in her sweetest , strangest tone , " Metamoris , I received a marriage proposalthis winter ! " " You did  --  oh , I mean  --  you did ! " He was slightly dumbfounded , not because it was an unexpected or unlikely development , but because of the surprising method she employedto inform him . He strove hard to subordinate any reaction of jealousy , despite the instinctive chagrin that gripped him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from overly interested in the matter . When he said no more , Wynoma , in a disappointed , pouting voice , inquired , " Are n't you even going to ask who made it ? " " Should I ? " A slight smile played on his features . Seeingthe hurt expression on her face he added hastily : " Yes , I should ! Who was it ? " " The Beaver , " she replied simply , her eyes downcast as she seated herself beside him on the huge bear rug where he was reclining . " Then I have a most worthy opponent . The Beaver is an able chieftain . When was he here ? " " In the moon of falling snow . " " I suppose he has returned many times since then ? " " No . " " Did your father bring his proposal to you ? " " Yes ! " " He could hardly do otherwise for a young man of the stature of the Beaver . Should I ask you what your answer was ? Perhaps that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have heard about it before this . " She laughed provocatively , enjoying the anguished suspensewhich Metamoris could scarcely conceal . " You need have no fear  --  if you really did  --  and I do hope you did ! " She wrinkled her cute nose as she added the last hopeful suggestion as an afterthought . " There was only one answer I could give him  --  No ! ' I told him my heart spoke of another ! " " Truly you are a wonderful maiden , Wynoma , my dear one . But do you really believe another is worthy of that answer to the Beaver ? " " I do not doubt it  --  never for a moment  --  no matter what comes ! " She spoke softly , but resolutely , her ex/pressive eyes conveying the confidence she felt as much as her deep-meaning words . " I do not know that . I wish I did . I do know this , though . Another desires to be worthy , but I do not know if he really is ! " " IS THERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of near-freezing weather the cold snap broke , and the warm southwest wind moved back . Spring burst forth on every hand ! One day they strolled up to the secluded little pool  --  Wynoma 's dreaming place ! A few days of this mild weather had brought the buds flocking out on the trees . All at once the strangeness was gone ! Every shackle of reserve vanished . They laughed together as they strolled merrily up the winding path  --  and why should n't they laugh ? They were together and they were young and this was springtime ! " Metamoris , my chief , " she asked , as they faced each other , reclining on the soft grass close by the spring , " you are my lover , are n't you ? " " Oh , oh , " he told himself , " better be on guard ! Something'scoming ! " So he replied in rather guarded words . " Why , yes , my strange one , I think I am . " Then he added , at the behest of his emotion rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am  --  that is , I want to be ! " " Metamoris , my lover , I have a surprise for you ! " His intuition was right ! He would n't have to wait much longer to learn why she had been acting so strangely . This was it  --  no mistake about it . He gave her a piercing look . All he could see in the depths of those brown eyes was happiness and daring mischief  --  as usual  --  only something told him she was serious this time . " Go on , " he replied firmly . " Are you sure you 're ready for a big surprise ? " " Knowing you , my precious Lenape flower , it would bep250more of a surprise if it was n't a surprise . What are you hiding from me , anyway ? " " It 's the biggest surprise I 've ever given you , " she added teasingly . " I tell you I 'm never prepared for your surprises , but I shall try to keep from falling into the pool and drowning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me any longer , strange one . I 'm most eager to know ! " " Metamoris ! " She spoke softly , and suddenly grave , drawing her face close to his and , peering intently into his eyes , she told him , " We 're going to be married ! " Metamoris was surprised . For a while he just looked at her  --  stupefied  --  not so much because of the content of her statement , for he , too , accepted that ultimateness , if fate permitted  --  but certainly he had not expected it at this time  --  and so bluntly , too ! Small wonder she had been so mysterious ! She was as unpredictable as ever  --  even more so ! " Well , " he said finally , " that is a surprise , though not an unpleasant one . I should be most unhappy if I thought we were n't ! " " Oh , but we 're going to be married now , before you leave to join Tecumseh ! " Ile had realized , numbly , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thunderbolt , notwithstanding . " Do n't look so shocked , my chief . I told you it would be a surprise . I have thought much about this matter during the long winter you were away . Believe me , it will be better this way . You love me and I love you ! That 's all that matters . We need each other  --  now , as well as later . Do n't you see that it 's that way , my beloved ? " " You 've made up your mind , have n't you , Wynoma ? " " Yes , Metamoris ! " " You 're a very determined maiden , as well as a very strange one , are n't you ? " " Where you and I are concerned , Metamoris ! Do n't you see , if war must come and separate us , we at least will have had each other for a while . If I should have a child and you should not return , I will be less lonely and much happier if I have your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the remainder of my life . Ca n't you under/stand how I feel , Metamoris ? I am grown now . My father has given his permission for me to marry you . " There was a prolonged silence as Metamoris stared fixedlyat the ground . " I had n't thought of it just that way  --  I mean at this time , Wynoma . I had only thought it would be hard for you to go on alone  --  and marry again if you had a child by me . What if there was one  --  or more  --  and I should be killed  --  then what ? " " It would make no difference , " she replied . " I would be grateful to the Great Spirit for every child of yours that he should give me . " " But it might be difficult to remarry . " " I do not want another husband but you , my chief ! " A prolonged silence followed . Then he said : " Wynoma , I could never refuse you anything . Your happiness means more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought we had decided to wait until after the war  --  at least , not this soon ! " " Metamoris , is there strong love in your heart for me ? " " You know there is , my precious one . It would do me no good to deny it . You would know better ! " " That 's the answer you seek , Metamoris ! What we agreed on is not good for what exists in our hearts . We must admit we were wrong and follow the command of our hearts . The heart is closer to the soul than the head . In love it is not good to deny the heart  --  at least , not for long . " " But will not our problems but become larger if we marry and are apart so much of the time ? " " I will answer you by asking you a question . Would we not be more secure in the knowledge that we belong to each other  --  completely  --  as we face our trials ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong argument . It 's just that it 's so sudden . " " You 're going to marry me one day , Metamoris ? " she asked softly as she placed her hand on his . " As surely as summer will return to the face of the earth , I will claim you as my own  --  if the Great Manitou wills it , Wynoma , " he replied passionately . " Then there is no reason to delay . Marry me  --  now  --  Metamoris ! We will both be far happier if you do . " " If you have made up your mind , I shall not try to dissuadeyou or disappoint you . "  | " Oh , I do love you , Metamoris  --  very much ! I want only to make you a good wife and be a good mother to your children ! " " Wynoma , " he whispered tenderly as he enfolded her in his strong arms . Plans for the wedding went forward . Wynoma and her mother and their neighbors worked diligently , preparing for the forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding the Sarah Town had ever known , as Lapinabit had reigned as chief during all of the twenty winters the town had been established on the Wapihani . Excitement grew by the hour ! Because hunting was poor in the early spring , all availablehunters were in the woods scouring the countryside for food . Wynoma spent much of her time collecting things she would need to set up her own household . Even though Metamoris would be gone all summer , she determined to maintain a separate home from her parent 's place of abode . Earthen and metal pots and pans would be given and delivered by friends on the wedding day  --  since present giving was the principal feature of a Lenape marriage ceremony . Also , she spent considerable time sewing  --  mostlyon deerskin clothes which she would present to her husband on their wedding day . These consisted of blouse , leggings , and moccasins . Fancy beads , featuring various designs , she sewed on all these items of apparel . Metamoris had much to occupy his thoughts during the five-day interlude before the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her parents such as would befit his high station as a chief and his bride 's as the daughter of an elder sachem . The decision to marry had caught him wholly unprepared to cope with this **26;5343;TOOLONG custom ! Most of his worldly possessionswere back in his own village on the Wapinepay.  |p253Going  there and returning before the ceremony , or even before the time to leave for Greenville , was out of the question . He must do the best he could with whatever was available  --  and that was n't much . He pondered over this matter so earnestly that he fell into a mood of near brooding . " What can I give this wonderful maiden that will be worthy of her and her father 's position ? " he asked himself . When he mentioned this perplexing dilemma to her , Wynoma scoffed at his concern for tradition and gift giving . " I want a husband , not gifts ! You , my handsome warrior , are the best gift I can receive ! " " But I want to wed my wife in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down on by the people ! " " Believe me , my chief , when I say I only want what you have to give me . I would value most something that means much to you , not something of great worth . You wear a band of copper on your ankle . Would  --  I mean  --  would it be asking too much Perhaps you would n't want to part with it ? " " It will be yours , my fair one ! It does mean much to me ! Tecumseh gave it to me . But it would mean more to see you wear it . " " Oh , thank you , thank you , it will be a wonderful weddinggift because it is a part of you ! " " I have still another gift of that kind to give you , Wynoma  --  one that means more to me even than the band . Here , " and as he said it he reached quickly for a small deerskin pouch hanging at his waist , opened it , and drew therefrom a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession ! It shall be yours , too , on our wedding day ! " She took the piece and examined it carefully and lovingly . It depicted the spirit of the Great Manitou watchingover a young maiden in the woods . " It 's beautiful , " she said softly . " It must mean a lot to you . Where did it come from ? " " It was my mother 's . She got it back in the east before I was born . She gave it to me just before she died ! I have always kept it with me ! "  | " Oh , Metamoris , I feel you should keep it now . Your mother meant for you to have it . " " Wynoma , you and it are the most precious things in the world to me ! I want you together . I 'm sure she would , too ! " " Then I shall wear it , my loved one , not as mine , but as yours  --  for you  --  and proudly ! It will be as if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast  --  even though you are far away . " " SO FOOLISH , SO WONDERFUL , DEAR HEART ! " The following day found Metamoris ranging far into the woods in quest of meat for the celebration feast . The prospective husband should supply considerable game for the entertainment of his guests as they celebrate with him the greatest of events of his life . As he walked noiselessly across the carpet of the forest floor his mind wandered far afield , reflecting on the course of his life ! Away from the village and the disarming influence of the love of his heart , he was able to clear away the webs of confusion and think clearly . " Funny that I never thought of marriage in the same way she did . I love that maiden with every spark of my being  --  she belongs to me and I to her  --  there 's no questionabout that . Perhaps I was selfish in wishing to postponemarriage until the danger of war is past . At least I was foolish to think I could withstand a maiden like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her or her love for me ! One thing is sure  --  I did n't ! Tecumseh was right . I could n't ! I suppose he was also right in contendingthat there 's no reason why I should wait . Wynoma sees it that way , too . Guess I was wrong . " Still , Metamoris was disturbed . His was a melancholy and pensive mood . Having the love of a maiden like that should make one very happy for many days to come  --  marriage or no marriage . But he was n't ! There was some/thing wrong . He could n't quite understand what it was  --  or perhaps he refused to admit that he was unhappy becausethe marriage , which he wanted more than anything else in the world , was being forced upon him  --  in a way . She had n't said " Metamoris , will you ? " She had said " Metamoris , we are going to be married  --  now ! " True , she meant no harm , for she well knew his love for her was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they also had agreed to wait . Had he really had any part in changing the plans ? A very little matter , but one that disturbed him considerably . " How much more pleasant , " he told himself , " if things were different  --  if we were n't pressed for time , if I did n't have to rush away right after the ceremony , if war was n't so threatening , if the situation of my people on Wapinepaywas n't so dire . I have gained the love of the most wonderful maiden alive and now I am about to marry her ! " Still , he was troubled and unhappy . The first night out he slept in the turned-up half of a hollow log . Hour after hour he lay there , sleepless , gazing at the brilliant display of stars overhead , locked in solemn meditation . Some time after midnight he drifted into a restless slumber . Sleep thoughts were hardly more satisfyingthan conscious ones . Too many things were wrong to permit peace to either the conscious or subconscious mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplations , just were n't there . And all because the human side of this human son of the wild forest resentedbeing forced to marry at a time other than of his own choosing  --  even to the maiden of his heart 's desire . Oh , he would not admit this to himself . His reasons were far nobler than that  --  those having to do with waiting until after the war clouds had passed by , the added strain of the long separations ahead , and so on . They had made sense to him , but somehow she had n't seen them that way . Pride and vanity kept creeping in and latching onto practicalreasoning as a camouflage for their destructive activities . The passion that had naturally overwhelmed the lovers at the pool had churned up emotions and depths of longing he had intended to keep subordinated . As he restlessly renewed the old conflict of duty versus desire , the samep256old doubts and misgivings welled up anew ! From somewherea voice reminded again that wars could best be fought by young men free of the haunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactions of the flesh which spiritual communion over time and distance could never produce . Why set up these barriers to dedicatedduty when it was neither necessary nor expedient ? Morning came , and it was followed by a full day of intensified , but fruitless hunting  --  both in the search for game and the seeking after peace of mind . Neither seemed to be available . Just before dusk , however , he came across the fresh track of a large deer  --  obviously a full-grown buck . For a few minutes all was concentrated on the thrill of the hunt and the anticipation of the kill . Cautiously , expertly , he stalked his prey . Quickly determining the downwind side of the buck , he advanced slowly and deliberatelytoward a small creek ahead , the likely destinationof his quarry . Again checking the wind direction , he crept forward slowly to a spot where he could command a view of a long stretch of the stream . Sure enough , there was the buck , and a beauty at that , standing quietly in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his head to test the scent of the wind for any indication of danger . On his stomach , Metamoris inched forward through the high grass along the bank . When he was within accurate shooting distance he stopped , checked his rifle carefully , and brought it up in aiming position . Just then the buck , more from instinct than any sound or danger signal , lifted his head and glanced swiftly around , at the same time pawing the shallow water and dilating his nose nervously as he strained to prove the accuracy of his hunch . For a brief instant his body quivered in uncertainty as he decided , first to heed the inner warning and , second , to determinewhich way to make his lightninglike retreat . But that brief instant of hesitation was his undoing , for in that short space of time Metamoris squeezed the trigger and a bullet hole suddenly appeared in the center of the buck 's forehead ! The preliminary jump that would have initiated the hasty retreat never materialized . Instead , he stood stock still for one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight ahead . Then , suddenly , he collapsed in the shallow water , his body quivering again , this time in the throes of sudden death ! The weight of the huge deer would have been a considerableload for two braves and a normal load , quartered , for four . Metamoris , however , after eviscerating the animaland removing as much excess weight as possible , shouldered it laboriously and , bending way forward under the staggering load , began the return journey to the Sarah Town . Frequent rest periods were necessary and each time he lifted the carcass the weight seemed to increase . He made only about a mile that evening , and then he was forced to stop for the night . Tying vines around the legs of the buck , he climbed a tree and pulled the vines over a substantial limb . Descending , he hoisted on the vine rope and by a prodigious effort managed to pull the body of the deer well up in the air above the reach of hungry wolves . Then he tied the vines to an adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , he proceeded to eat the small quantity of dried meat he carried , and , after a drink from a nearby brook , lay down beneath a huge tree to rest . A long night of mental tussling , marked by alternating periods of fitful sleep and restless waking followed . The sleep consisted of a series of bad dreams to which he was no stranger . The mental scenes that flashed through his mind were confusing and widely varying . There he was rushing upon the pointed barrels of the long rifles . He noted that tears ran down his bare cheeks as he brandished his tomahawk and led the attack . Then he saw a peaceful tepee scene , with Wynoma seated before the open flap of the tent , nursing a tiny papoose , while a boy of two or three winters tottered around the area , playing busily . He awoke from the dream in a cold sweat . The next time he dozed he pictured Wynoma and himself with their several children being swept along over a vast treeless plain by a group of Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge rawhide whip come cracking down over Wynoma 's back as she stumbled and faltered . He struggled in his frenzy to assist her , but his hands were tied behind him and a rope around his neck dragged him onward . Suddenly he saw one of the little ones startp258to cry and run out of the line of march . Instantly a Big Knife bayonet ran the child through and silenced its agonized screams  --  forever ! The scene changed and now he fancied himself traveling in distant parts of the country with Tecumseh  --  traveling on and on , but never returning home to where his wife and children longed for him . By the time the morning light rose in the eastern sky , he was up , ready to resume the trip , but more exhausted than when he lay down the night before . That day , the day before his wedding day , was one of the hardest he ever experienced . The weather was wet and cold . A chilling drizzle fell during a good part of the day . He struggled painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times staggering dizzily , but always determined to get the carcass back under his own power  --  as a personalgift to his future father-in-law . About midafternoon he stumbled into the tepee area of the chief and dumped the buck onto the ground . For a moment he wavered and nearly collapsed . Then , straightening himself , he walked laboriously but proudly into his tepee and sank down upon the bearskin rug spread there for him . Seconds later , Wynoma rushed in , dropped silently to her knees , and began to minister to his needs . She realized even before she touched him that he was ill . Tenderly she washed his face and body , massaging his aching muscles . As she worked she lovingly upbraided him for the excessive exertionhe had imposed upon himself . " Metamoris , my dear heart , why have you tortured yourself so ? You should have taken other hunters with you to help bear the burden . You are so foolish and so wonderful ! " He lay as one unconscious , yet she felt he was hearingevery word she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why you hunted alone ! I only hope the Great Spirit has given you the peace of mind you sought , even as he has seen you sap all your strength ! " As she gently stroked his brow and ran her fingers lightly through the braided scalp lock adorning the top of his head , she noted the long , even rhythm of his breathingand judged that he had dropped off to sleep . For a long while she sat beside him watching , waiting , wondering !  | " I know you do n't hear me now , dear heart , " she whispered . " There is so much I would like to say to you . Have I pushed you too hard on the marriage ? I wish I could tell you it would be all right with me to call it off till later . I want to tell you that if you want it that way I want it that way  --  no matter how long we must wait ! In the morning we must discuss these things all over again . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . Occasionally she would feel his head and note that the fever spirits were burning him . Then she would sponge his face with cooling water . Sometime in the middle of the dark sleep , she arose . " He will be all right till morning . He is not so hot now . " Gently she pulled the blanket over him and slipped silently out of his tepee , returning to her own quarters . A HASTY DECISIONMetamoris slept soundly . No visions of despair and doom plagued his subconscious thoughts , but still there was a dreading apprehension attaching itself to his dormant faculties . Toward morning he awoke with a start . The uncertainty of the previous days joined the feverish disturbanceof his exhaustive sleep to become a sudden reality of hasty decision . He did n't hesitate . Quietly he arose , rolled his blanket , hastily removed the band from his ankle and laid it on the bed . Beside it he placed his mother 's charm piece and the wampum pouch from his waist . Then , picking up the blanket , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path to the river . Loosening a canoe , he stepped in and pushed it lightly offshore . Paddling his way with determined strokes out into the stream , he began the eastward journey to Greenville.  |p260At  the first ray of dawn , Wynoma awoke . Arising hurriedly , she tiptoed into the guest lodge to determine if her chief was still sleeping . " This is my wedding day ! " she reminded herself as she slipped up to his pallet . " What more could any maiden ask than this manly warrior who will become my husbandthis day  --  unless  --  but I must give him the choice . Oh , I do hope he wants it that way ! If he does , he will not sleep here alone tonight ! I shall share his bed with him ! Oh wonderful day ! " She could not believe her eyes when she saw the empty bed ! For a horror-stricken moment she stared at it . Suddenly , every drop of blood seemed to leave her head and heart ! Instinctively , one hand went to her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to her that he might be near by . Wynoma knew the true answer even as she sank pitifully to the floor , her hands coming into contact with the precious trinkets he had left on the bed . Prostrating herself across the mat , clutching desperatelythe gifts , she softly sobbed her heart out ! The tears rolled down her cheeks in torrents  --  like Wapihani 's spring floods ! When finally she emerged from the tepee , the Sun Father had crept high above the eastern trees . Though red and swollen , her eyes were dry and her demeanor well composed . She went straight to her mother who was busily engaged with her extra-heavy morning chores . " Mother , " she said softly , " there will be no wedding today ! " Yanenowi was so surprised at the girl 's startling and resigned words that she could n't answer for a moment . She just stood and stared at her daughter 's calm , quietly suffering face . " What do you mean , Child ? What on earth has hap-pened ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's just the way it is ! "  | " Surely you 're mistaken , my precious child . How do you know ? " " He is not in his tent . " " Perhaps he has gone to hunt for a while this morning . Ile will return shortly . He would not leave ! " " You are wrong , Mother ! He has gone . He left me these ornaments which were to be wedding gifts  --  they meant much to him ! " " But , Child , why would he leave ? Did he not bring in a buck only last evening for the wedding feast ? " " Yes , my mother , but he felt he should not marry while he traveled and when the war was near . He wanted to marry me , but he could n't ! Oh , he tried to go through with it , but he just could n't ! It was all my idea . I was a fool ! I tried to force him  --  and I was wrong  --  so very wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  on the day of the ceremony  --  with the whole town and people from other towns coming for the celebration ! What will they say , Wynoma ? What will they think ? " " We will say nothing , Mother , except that there will be no wedding or feast ! " " Your father , Wynoma  --  this will be an awful blow to him . That young man meant more to him than any young man in the whole tribe  --  even his own household ! " " I know , Mother , I know ! I 'm sorry for my father ! " And , indeed , Lapinabit was prostrated ! If it had been any other young man than the youthful Wapinepay chief , he would have been much incensed and would have vowed personal vengeance for the affront . He , the chief , and his daughter , the most beautiful maiden among all the Lenape  --  the most sought after  --  and she is dealt such a cruel blow on her wedding day ! The great chief retired to his tepee irreconcilable ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various trails to the outlying regions . " No weddingtoday . " No one could believe it or understand it ! A deathly calm settled over the entire village . Even the children sensed the gravity which invaded the demeanors of the adult folk . Later , in the afternoon , Wynoma walked proudly out of the village , her head high , and up the branch trail to herp262pool retreat . She knew every eye in the village was upon her , although none was obvious . There she was at the pool when Yanenowi found her just before dark that evening . " Wynoma , Child , " she said sympathetically , as she dropped down on the soft grass beside her daughter , " let your mother share your great sorrow ! Lay your sweet head here on my shoulder . Let me comfort you ! Tell me all that burdens your heart . It would be good for you , my child , if you would unburden your soul and allow the tears to flow freely . " A few low sobs were the only response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My daughter , you do not believe your young man has left you forever , do you ? " Without lifting her head from its sheltered position on her mother 's breast , Wynoma answered slowly , " I do n't know , Mother ! " " But I am sure the young chief loved you , Child . " " Yes , Mother , he loved me . I have not lost his love , but I may have lost him ! " " My child , your words are a riddle . " " There are so many things that stand between Metamoris and me , Mother  --  so many things that can prevent him from returning ! " " What besides death would keep him from returning to the side of my beautiful and deserving daughter  --  who loves him so much ! " " You have spoken the answer , my mother . Death in war with the whites is a very grave danger confronting Metamoris and many other young men . If war comes , Metamoris will be in the forefront of any attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , and many will fall ! " She shuddered instinctively as she said it and Yanenowi held her tightly in her arms . " Metamoris fears that he will be killed  --  and , oh , my mother , I also fear that he will be killed ! " " But , my child , the chance of losing her husband in war always hangs over the head of the Indian woman  --  and has from the beginning of time . Why would he not marry you anyway ? His children would not be the first to bep263left fatherless by war  --  that is most common among the red people . " " Mother , there is more than just the danger of leaving his children fatherless that moves Metamoris . He has a big and deep mind , Mother , like the water in the pool here . He can see farther ahead than the rest of us . So can Tecumseh ! That is why they travel about the land , calling upon the tribes to awaken to the great danger confrontingthem . " For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's breast . After a while , she spoke again : " One time , Mother , he was sitting right here and he said to me : Wynoma , the time for life for the red people on this earth is fading away  --  just as the game of the forests is disappearing . ' And then he said again : Time , for you and I , Wynoma , is running out . ' Do you know what he meant , Mother ? " Yanenowi shook her head slowly as she watched the strange light in her daughter 's eyes and listened to the mysterious , prophetic words she was uttering . " He believes the Indian people are doomed to disappear off the face of the earth . Oh , he does not think that all will be killed in war , as he and Tecumseh and many others probably will be , but they will gradually disappear . They will be pushed ever westward ! Finally , they will be pushed into little groups  --  in small areas  --  like the white man 's animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a terrible toll ! Even worse than that  --  our people will not be happy ! Their hearts will be sad as they pine for the free life of the forest which will be gone forever ! Their spirits will be destroyed ! Their minds will become dull . The white man 's firewater will destroy both their senses and their health . The tribal distinctions will disappear and what few are left for the white man to gaze in wonder at will be a mixture of all the tribes and will know only the ways of the whites and not the ways of their fathers ! " " But , Wynoma , " her mother asked incredulously , " will the Great Spirit allow such awful things to befall his red children ? " " I do not know , Mother , nor does Metamoris ! That is why he works to rally the tribes to join together and fight2p264for their freedom and their lands ! If the Great Spirit wills for us to live , he will reward the efforts of that it will be his will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move west of the Great River  --  to what fate no one can tell , except that the things I have just told you that Metamoris said will likely come about . " " How strangely you speak , my daughter . What kind of a spell has the young chieftain from Wapinepay woven over you ? " " No spell , Mother , only an understanding of his mind  --  perhaps more clearly than he himself understands it ! I was so wrong in forcing marriage upon him ! I know it now . But it may be too late ! " " Surely , my daughter , it will not be so ! The young chief left you his sacred keepsakes ! That must mean you are the only woman in his life ! " " I hope it is so , Mother , I do so hope it is so ! " " Even if it were otherwise , or if the young chief did not return by reason of the will of the Great Spirit , there are many other fine young men , Wynoma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer themselves to marry her ! " Wynoma appeared not even to hear Yanenowi 's words , for she spoke on of things still bearing heavily on her heart . If she heard , she deemed them not worthy of reply . " Metamoris is prepared to offer his life gladly to save our land . It grieves him to think of leaving a wife and fatherless children  --  for their lives in the west , without the strengthening hand of their father in childhood , would be miserable and sad . " As the shadows settled deep over the woods , she added : " I do not believe he will always feel that he does not wish to father children  --  but his mind is too disturbed and the times too unsettled for him to marry today . Oh , Mother , I only regret that I failed him in this matter about which he felt so strongly . How I wish I had not pressed for an immediate marriage , but had waited for him to decide the time . Now I may never know the thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  |p265The  summer of 1807 was hot , dry and punishing . Fever took a heavy toll , both among the pioneers and the tribesfolk . Tecumseh and Metamoris conferred with the governor of Ohio and with representatives of the government on the Potomac . The situation was so tense , the danger of violence so imminent , Tecumseh did n't dare to travel to distant tribes . In the moon of deep summer a letter arrived at Greenville from Thomas Jefferson , President of the United States , directed to the Shawnee nation . The President personally requested the Shawnees to remove from their Greenville settlement on government lands , promising assistance in locating new hunting grounds and pledging to continue certain support they were now receiving . Tecumseh thundered his answer at the Presidential emissary , Anthony Shane , representing William Wells , the generalIndian agent . " Tell your President these lands are ours ! No one has a right to remove us , because we were the first and only true owners ! The Great Spirit appointed us this place to light our fires , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father , the President of the Seventeen Fires , has anything more to say to me , he must send a man of note as his messenger . I will hold no further intercoursewith Captain Wells ! " The Prophet , then , in lofty , defiant tones , voiced a challengeto Thomas Jefferson . " Why do you not send the greatest man in your nation ? I can talk to him . I can bring darkness between him and me ; nay , more , I can bring the sun under my feet ; and what white man can do that ? " The Prophet was performing resplendently . The sweltering suns dragged by slowly , fretfully for Metamoris . When summer had faded and autumn had pranced midway down the red-leafed trail to winter 's cold , Metamoris prepared to return to Wapinepay . Around a crackling log fire one evening Tecumseh announced his plans . " There is much sentiment attached to this place in the hearts of the Shawnee . Many , I know , would prefer to die and be buried here . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westward . "  | " Our new home ? " the elder Bluejacket asked , pokerfaced , and in a voice intended to be poker-sounding . " At the mouth of the Tippecanoe , where it flows into the Wabash , " Tecumseh replied in stern kindness . Only silence greeted the announcement . As the dreary days and long , black nights of winter passed , Metamoris struggled against a passionate inner urge to return to Wynoma in the spring . But one thing he knew  --  if he ever returned to her it must be for marriage  --  or heartbreak  --  there was nothing in between ! Early in March he headed for Greenville , ready for the move to the Wabash country into the domain of William Henry Harrison . Shortly after his departure , the villagers at Metamoristownwere treated with an unusual sight . John Conner , his Lenape wife , Chimalus , their children and all their extensive properties came up the river trail heading for a new trading post location upstream . The bags of merchandisewhich he used to trade with the Indians for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpers . The party stayed overnight in the village and the next day continued on to their new location at the spot where the Indian trail , already known to white men as the Conner Trail , crossed the Wapinepay . Civilization was on the march ! The Shawnee removal from Greenville to the Wabash country in the spring of 1808 was no mere delegation or advance-guard party traveling west , as in 1805 . This was a mass exodus of men , women , and children and all theirp267worldly belongings . The long trek over the trails and through the dense woodlands was accomplished in a little over a moon of steady but leisurely traveling . The route lay south of the Wapihani Lenape towns , then across the river and northwesterly to the Wabash at the mouth of the Tippecanoe . Here the new town and tribal **25;5371;TOOLONG were to be established . This location had been a village site frequently in generations past . Promptly upon settling down there , Tecumseh and The Prophet proclaimed their new town to be a rallying point where all the red nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common defense of the tribal homelands ! They called it officially " Kethtippecannik , " or " Tippecanoe Town . " Generally it became known by both redskins and whites as " Prophetstown "  --  a fact that was not unpleasant to Lawlewasikaw ! As soon as the village folk were settled down , Tecumseh , Metamoris , and young Jim Bluejacket were off on an extendedtrip south to visit the Cherokees , Creeks , and Choctaws . At Sarah Town things had n't been the same since the unhappy day the chief 's daughter had been cruelly spurned by her betrothed on her wedding day ! As the spring and summer of 1807 ( following Metamoris ' nocturnal flight ) wore on , life appeared to settle back into its usual routine . But the matter was not forgotten ! No one talked about the blighted love affair , but the way they looked at Wynoma caused her to feel they were secretly pitying her  --  and that was hard to take , for she was a woman and they were pitying her because she had been rudely abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her daily routine of living as she always had . She went to the fields and worked . The women were friendly and kind  --  and , without expressingit , very sympathetic . " It would be easier , " she thought ,  | " if they would laugh openly or accuse me of not being able to hold my man . They expected more of me , the daughter of their chief  --  and I have disappointed them as well as myself . " She walked out to her favorite retreat and gazed into the mossy depths of the pool and lay on her back peering up at the lazy blue spaces above . She enjoyed the silence of the empty halls of the forest . It was soothing to her tortured feelings to be here at this spot of fanciful childhood , the place where she had spent precious , golden hours in his company or dreaming of him . The only relief she could find was to come here and muse on the fleeting happiness she had known when they had here contemplated together a future so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old thrill of make-believe and dreaming was gone ! The youthful enthusiasm and inner glow seemed to have died within her . The thoughts of love and marriage became sensations of agony and torture . As the moons passed and spring , then summer , disappeared , and fall , in its turn , faded into winter , so did the rosy hue of her swarthy cheek disappear and in its place the barren winterwas reflected in all of its bleak and lifeless melancholy ! She hoped vainly , against her womanly know-better , that he would return in the fall  --  just as he had always done before . It was not until the last vestiges of autumn disappeared , when the last clinging leaf let loose , sighed , and floated wearily down to the cold bosom of the forest  --  then and only then  --  did she cease her forlorn hoping that he would come ! For the first time in her life Wynoma failed to enjoy the winter sports that kept the young folk briskly healthy and exuberant during the cold moons . She remained inside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling personality and natural charm . When finally winter faded away across the weary , barren lands she was rejuvenated slightly with the colorful rebirth of the gladsomespring . It was , of course , more the bleak hope that he might come to her in the spring that was responsible for this spiritual rallying , rather than the rebirth of nature 's wonderland in the moon of summer 's return . But Metamoris did n't come ! Another did come , however . Up the river with the arrival of spring came again the Beaver , Tamaqua , withp269thoughts of love and romance weighing heavily on his young mind . His mission was a repeat performance . He had accepted the rejection Wynoma had handed him over a year before as a full rejection of his proposal of marriage . Now , however , the startling news of his successful rival 's unexpected departure on the eve of the wedding had cast a new light on the case . Knowing that the eldest daughter of Lapinabit was not only a beautiful maiden but spirited as well , he rightly guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suit . Nevertheless , Tamaqua renewed his suit . Prudently he waited through the summer and fall for the maiden either to patch up the old affair or heal the hurt of its termination . During the winter he planned to approach her father again  --  but , remembering that the first rejection had come in the cold and unromantic season , he bided his time and awaited the coming of spring with its suggestion of love and mating in every blossoming act of nature . Now it was May and the Beaver was back ! Everyone in town knew why , as his lean form stepped from his light canoe and walked proudly toward the lodge of the chief . A year had restored to Lapinabit his stoical selfcomposure , but it had not entirely erased the dismay occasioned by the Metamoris affair . Lapinabit looked the year older  --  and even more , perhaps . The strain of patiently enduring the change that had come to his beloved Wynoma , seeing the inner suffering she was experiencing , had left its marks on the dignified chief . He welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked together , discussing every conceivable subject of mutual interest before the youthful chief broached once more the subject of marriage and Wynoma . " Your eldest daughter has not married ? " It may have been a question or it may have been a statement . No matter , for the effect was the same  --  a stab of burning pain into the very depth of Lapinabit 's being ! " No , " he replied without feeling . " I take it she is not promised at this time ? " Again , Lapinabit answered without spirit or visible emotion . " I take that to be true ! But only the maiden knows what is in her heart . "  | " I am here once more to press the matter of taking her to wife . I await your pleasure in that regard . " Lapinabit smoked silently for a time , finally replying : " My worthy young friend , the Beaver does my household honor beyond its desserts in twice asking for my eldest daughter in marriage . To be the wife of Tamaqua , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be an honor any maiden should aspire to ! It would be highly pleasing to any father among the Lenape . I would be well satisfied if the maiden should decide to marry you . However , I must say , as before , that I wish my daughter to make her own choice of a husband . I shall not influence her . She is a fine maiden and able to decide for herself . Her happiness is the most important thing in the world to me ! Go , my friend , to the maiden . May the guidance of the Great Spirit be with her as she makes her decision . May he look with favor upon you forever ! " Wynoma , of course , was expecting Tamaqua . She bowed humbly , courteously before him . Tamaqua , standing straight and proud , his arms folded gracefully across his chest and turkey feathers hanging down his back , was an impressivefigure ! He spoke kindly and gallantly to this maiden who had so aroused his marital instinct  --  kindly , because he was genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gallantly , because his ardor for her affections , he found , was stronger than ever ! " The passing moons have not been unkind to the eldest daughter of my father , Lapinabit . As she advances to womanhood she increases in beauty and charm . Many Lenape hearts pound madly when their owners gaze upon her fair form . When she is sad the whole Delaware nation grieves with her ! " Wynoma colored deeply . Too late the Beaver realized he had said too much ! Wynoma 's eyes remained on the ground as she answered , " The chief speaks words of praise he can not feel in his heart . I am not worthy of such a tribute  --  especially from Tamaqua . His pity is not desired ! " " Tamaqua speaks only what he feels in his heart , " he replied gently . " Then perhaps he feels sadness for a poor maiden who once harshly rejected his offer of marriage and then herself was spurned on the day of her wedding ! "  | " Can the fair Wynoma think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her or show pity  --  or hurt her ? " There was strong feeling in his voice , suggesting genuine disappointment . " Forgive me , Chief . It was cruel of me to say or think that ! I do not doubt the intention of Tamaqua . He deservesa better reception from me than such an accusation . I am ashamed ! " " Do not be , my maiden . I desire only that you hear me as graciously as before and consider my humble entreaty as fairly as then . " " How could I deny Tamaqua that kind of treatment or how could I deny anything he should ask ? " " Wynoma , I should not want the answer I ask given on the basis of obligation or duty  --  but only as to what is in your heart ! I have come to ask you to be my wife ! " Wynoma stood silently before him and looked into his eyes . Then she asked softly , " What did my father say ? " " He said , Speak to the maiden . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own decision ! ' " " May we not walk out of the town and along the river  --  perhaps we shall be able to see and think more clearly ? " she suggested . The Beaver smiled as he answered , " I would be a poor suitor if I did not obey the maiden 's every wish  --  especially one so pleasant ! " As they walked slowly out of the village , neither spoke . Wynoma felt the eyes of the entire village population upon her . " What will they think , " she thought , " if they are disappointed again  --  if I once more deny them their great feast and celebration ? Will they not despise me ? " A few minutes later they stood by the river gazing out over its silvery waters . Wynoma looked up questioningly to her persistent admirer . " Tamaqua has not often been near me . How can he know that he loves me ? " " I have seen no other maiden I would want to marry  --  anyway , does the lark doubt his choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or having made it , does he change his decision short of the death of his mate ? No , he does not ! He is loyal to the mate he chooses and he never leaves her once the choice is made ! "  |p272Wynoma  winced under the polite , but certain dart of condemnation hurled at Metamoris even as the Beaver pledged his undying loyalty . If she could just condemn Metamoris in her own heart as readily as others , her decisionnow would be less complicated . She spoke in soft , low tones : " Does not the female lark exercise a right to accept or reject ? Does not she , too , make a choice ? " " It could be so ! I confess I know more about male larks than female . But , I well know that Lenape maidens have such a choice and I would not have it otherwise ! I would want to be acceptable in the maiden 's eyes before I received her favors ! " Tamaqua spoke in a low expressive voice . " Would you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Only she can answer that question , Wynoma ! I want to marry the lovely maiden I see before me ! She must decide whether she is free from the old ties . I can not make the favorable choice for her . Nor will I make the declining choice , either ! " " It is not an easy decision , Tamaqua , " she replied softly . " I know that . At least , I hope it is not an easy decision to make ! It is for that reason I have waited many moons to come to you ! " " You prove that you are a faithful friend  --  one to whom I owe much , " she said in an animated expression . " You deserve me for a wife if you want me ! " " I deserve nothing ! " There was a hint of bitter sharpnessin his voice . " I only want you if you want me ! " " I could not refuse you  --  again ! " " The princess of the Sarah Town still thinks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you really think he is faithless , Tamaqua ? " " What else could I or anyone think  --  what else can you think , my beautiful , gullible one ? " He moved his shoulders in resigned conviction to further emphasize his words . " I do not know ! " She struggled to smother the rising emotion that threatened to divulge the inner hurt in all its cruel rawness . " I only know that I have not my heart to offer you , Tamaqua , even if I should give you my body , for my heart is with Metamoris wherever he is ! "  | " How can you feel that kind of devotion after the way he left you ? " he asked incredulously . " When you give your heart completely , it is not easy to bring it back again , not even to accept it back when it is returned , " she replied sadly . " Yes , I know , Princess . I know ! " " I  --  I 'm truly sorry , Tamaqua  --  both ways  --  because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I am as cruel to your faithful love as he was to mine ! " " Has he ever been back ? " As she sadly shook her head without looking up , he asked , " Sent you any word ? " Again she shook her head . Her " No " was a barely audible whisper . This time it was the Beaver 's turn to shake his head . " I just ca n't understand it ! Do you expect him back ? " He could tell that she was biting her lip as she once more shook her pretty head . Tamaqua knew it was unfair to press this point , but the human element could n't resist . " Never ? " She forced her face up to his then , smiling slightly , bravely , through glistening tears ! " I do n't know ! But that 's really not important to us now ! " " I suppose it is n't , at that , " he replied , both stung and surprised by her kind , polite bluntness . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded himself . A prolonged silence followed as they listened to the songs of the birds around them caroling the joys of springtimepiquantly and weaving in fanciful song the age-old tale of nature 's mysterious optimism . After a while , the Beaver suggested : " Let 's see now . You would feel obligated to marry me if I press the matter , but you could not  --  perhaps never  --  give me your heart . Is that what you are saying , Wynoma ? " " Yes , Tamaqua , that is just about it ! " " Then you would prefer that I not go back to your father with an offer of marriage  --  you wish to wait in forlorn hope that he will return to you ? " She did n't answer , but nodded her head decidedly ! " Perhaps he will return one day , but not be changed . Perhaps he will sneak away again under more trying circumstances . What then ? "  | " You do not seem to understand , Tamaqua ! I doubt if my father understands either ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change ! " Again there was silence , then he said , " What a wonderfullove ! I not only lose you , but I lose such devotion ! I will always envy him that ! " The maiden answered wistfully and in a distant tone , " I shall always love him  --  as long as I live and then on into the land of the Great Mystery ! " " I hope he will not fail you ! You deserve much better than he has given you so far ! " " I 'm not sure about that , Tamaqua ! But I wish for your happiness , too ! Is there no other maiden for you  --  one who can make your life full and good as it should be ? " " If she 's not here with me now I do n't know where she is ! " " Perhaps she is a Miami maiden , or maybe she dwells out on the western plains or in the lake regions or in the southlands . Will you not seek her , Tamaqua , till you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox or wolf or the stubtailedbobcat ? No , he seeks his own kind ! " Wynoma smiled genuinely for the first time as she said , " You are a great chief , Tamaqua , and a wonderful friend to me  --  most of all because you do not take me to wife when you might well have it within your power to do so ! Only a great man of honor would do that ! I will always bless in my heart Tamaqua , my friend ! " Many a questioning look followed them back to the village , while inquisitive eyes watched , wonderingly , as the noble Beaver took leave of the head chief and his eldest daughter . They saw him walk proudly to his light canoe and glide swiftly down the river out of sight . Tecumseh and two youthful companions left Prophetstownthe last of April , traveling on horseback in a south/westerly direction . Reaching the great Illinois prairies they turned south for the Ohio beyond its junction with the Wabash . They traveled light so as not to burden their horses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical reasons : first , to appear as such to inquisitiveeyes along the way and , second , to be hunters and supply themselves with game during their wanderings . Each man carried a newly acquired British rifle slung across the front of his saddle  --  within a second 's reach if necessity should arise . Plenty of ammunition was brought along and this constituted the bulk of the extra weight carried by the sturdy animals selected for the trip . Bow and arrow were at hand for normal , leisurely hunting and to preserve the precious supply of powder and lead . Hatchets and knives completed the equipment . Each was dressed lightly with only bare essentials for wilderness protection  --  blouse , leggings , and moccasins  --  with no frills or ornaments to interfere with the rigorous journey ahead . Several days of constant riding brought them to the broad expanse of the lower Ohio . Here they paused long enough to construct a rude but substantial raft  --  consistingof trimmed saplings tied together with stout vines . Careful paddling by two of them , while the other devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the placid waters of the beautiful river . Mounting , the little group headed south , following trails not unfamiliar to Tecumseh , who had spent much of his youth with his older brother , Cheesekau , traversing the southern forests . Traveling through the great forests of western Kentucky , they carefully avoided the white settlementsspringing up there . Tecumseh related to his young companions the singular history of these Kentucky huntinggrounds . " This , " he told them , " has been common hunting grounds for all nations , both south and north ! Many great battles between northern and southern tribes have been fought in these forests ! " Metamoris and young Jim Bluejacket , son of the renownedShawnee chieftain of the same name , drank in every word . They were receiving the best education their way of life afforded and they made the most of it . " Our Shawnee ancestors , " he continued , " were of Algon/quin descent , a very old tribe , though not of as ancient lineage as you Delawares and the Wyandottes . Many generationsago the Shawnees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northward through the years . Thus we trace kinship with both northern and southern tribes . In the south , they were located on the shores of the eastern waters and often fought the Catawbas , a people now largely vanished because the white men overran their homelands . The Shawnees also were in frequent contact with the larger nations in the south  --  Cherokees , Creeks , and Choctaws . There were Shawnee villages established among those southern peoples for many generations , just as in recent times Shawnee villages were found in all parts of the north and east woodlands . Intermarriage with other tribes has been frequent . My own mother , for instance , was a Creek woman . " When the push of the white man came , the English Yankwis across the eastern mountains and the French from their towns around the mouth of the Father of Waters , many of our Shawnee forefathers , Young Jim , traveled through these forests and settled among their relatives north of the Ohio . " Seated around their glowing campfires at night or riding easily along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found ready answers for all their inquiries . They came to formulate ideas of what lay ahead of the red race in accordance with Tecumseh 's practical , farseeing logic . " Do you think you can convince all these southern tribes to join the confederation ? " Metamoris asked . " I can try  --  with the help of those who believe as I do  --  and not only the southern tribes , but the western peoples beyond the Great River , " was the undaunted reply . " It will be no easy task , it seems to me , considering how the tribes have always warred against each other , " the younger man reasoned . " You are right ! These tribes have not felt the sting of the long rifles as have we . They know little of the cannonand weapons used in the white man 's wars . This is especially true of the western tribes , many of whom have yet to lay eyes upon the hairy-faced , white-skinned ones . They will be slower to awaken to the grave danger . Itp277is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or east to fight with us , when but a while ago they were making war upon us and we upon them ! We cannotbring them together in a season . This cause of uniting the tribes must go on long after we are dead ! " " The western tribes have more warriors by far than we , do they not ? " Young Jim asked . " True , but they are not trained to fight with the weapons and after the fashion of the white man . These Big Knife Yankwis fight with their heads and hands both ! They are trained to fight skillfully in both white and Indian modes of warfare . What chance will the Osages or Sioux have , with all their warriors , when the white armies pour across the river ? They do not even have trees to hide behind . If they do not help us stop the enemy here in the forests they will be swiftly wiped off the face of the earth in open warfare . Mark you well my words , young brothers , perhaps nothing will stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the will of the Great Ruler of the world  --  but if they are prevented from taking any part of this vast country it must be by a combined force of warriors from all the tribes  --  south , east , north , and west ! Not only will we be more formidable as a united force , but if we demonstrate to all the world that we stand together in our determination to retain a portion of our lands , the sympathies of other nations across the great waters will be brought to bear upon the Yankwis to consider our sad plight and agree to divide the land in some fair manner . " As he spoke his arms traversed majestically a huge circle around his head and the firelight glowed solemnly on his gaunt , determined features . " You 've convinced me , Father ! I 'm with you all the way ! How about you , Jim ? " Metamoris responded in goodhumoredsincerity . " Save your arguments for those who need them , Father , " Young Jim exclaimed enthusiastically ! " Metamoris and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite ! "  |p278Several  more days of steady riding brought the travelers to Tuckabatchee , a considerable-sized Creek village on the Tallapoosa River in the Georgia-Alabama country . Dismountingat the edge of town they walked quietly , leading their horses into the center of a shouting , curious throng of excited townspeople . Tecumseh , in the Creek language , and with a ringing voice of authority , directed three neargrownboys to take charge of the horses and turn them out on pasture . Before turning their mounts over to the proud lads the visitors were careful to remove temptation from the youthful grooms by taking their guns and baggagewith them . A group of village chieftains approached quickly through the rapidly expanding crowd , shoving children and older people roughly out of their path as they approached . " Welcome , brothers from the northlands , " one of the head men hailed them . " You have traveled far and must be weary ! " " Greetings to our brothers of the Creek nation , " Tecumsehreplied . " Our brother has most discerning eyes ! We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in peace and have no cause for haste ! " " That is good , " the spokesman returned . " We are observingour corn-planting celebration and since you come in peace we invite you to tarry among us and share in our festivities . " " We accept the invitation gladly ! It is great joy to visit among my mother 's people ! I am Tecumtha , a Shawnee warrior , but I have as much Creek blood in my veins as Shawanese . " " Then we are twice honored , Tecumtha , to have you in our midst , as a brother by skin and by blood ! You are known to us . The fame of Tecumseh and The Prophet is well known among all the red-skinned tribes ! " " Thank you , my brother . My companions here are distinguishedyoung chiefs among their peoples . This is Metamoris , a true son of the noble Grandfathers , the LenniLenape , and young Bluejacket , a Shawnee . " The Creek chieftain extended his arms upward , then out/ward in a sign of acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of all the Muscogee . " Hundreds of arms followed the example of their chief , according the visitors the universal sign of friendship . " We are hunting far from our homes . We seek new friends and greet old ones , " Tecumseh informed their host . " You will be honored guests during the celebration . My people are pleased to have Tecumseh and his companions in our town ! " The bystanders had been silent as they watched the exchange of greetings between their chief and the strangers . Now , however , a buzz of conversation moved through the crowd as the identity of the elder stranger quickly spread . " In our corn-planting ceremonies , " the chief explained in a jovial tone , " we give thanks to the Great Master of Life for the crop that has been planted and implore the assistance of his rain , sun , and wind spirits to make it a bountiful harvest . The ceremonial dances are for these symbolic purposes . We trust you will enjoy the activities . " " We are most grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your festivities . My young friends have never been among peoples far distant from their own tribal lands . Your customs and ceremonies will no doubt prove of interest to them . " As he spoke he gave his companions a sly glance that caused Metamoris to say to Young Jim in a low voice : " I wish I could understand what they 're saying . Somethingtells me he knows more about this celebration than we know . " " I agree , " Jim responded , " I saw that crafty look he gave us . No use asking him , though . He would n't tell us a thing ! " The next two days the youths followed closely at their leader 's heels , as his easygoing , graceful form moved calmly among the people . As honored visitors they were given free run of the town . Nor was Tecumseh slow in responding to the opportunity ! He discussed with the peoples the calamities that were everywhere befalling the red men . He described vividly how the white settlers in the northlands were making islands of destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful as when you were children ? " he asked . When they answered emphatically inp280the negative , he added : " North of the Ohio many tribes are thrown together in small areas and the game has all but disappeared . The villages are finding it difficult to surviveduring the winters and the hunger spirits constantly hover around our heads  --  like vicious , howling wolves ! " Gaining their attention with this shocking introduction , he forged ahead into the theme of his life 's work  --  convincingIndians of the need of intertribal union in the face of the white man 's advance westward . " First , it was the buffalo that vanished , then the elk , now the deer ! Rarely does one see a bear north of the Ohio ! But there are plenty of pigs and cows in the white man 's clearings  --  jealously guarded by his long-barreled rifles . " Do you know why the game is disappearing ? " he asked . " It is because the forests are being destroyed  --  by axe and by fire ! Then what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hickory and nut-bearing trees are being cut down . Even the squirrels are forced to roam more widely through the woods seeking nuts . The berry patches are burned off so the white man can plant his crops . Rail fences close off the trails so that we can no Ionger travel them as of old . What will come of it all ? I will tell you , brothers ! The white governor on the Wabash demands new cessions of lands ! Each season he calls councils and treats with separate tribes and village chiefs to acquire more land . This purchase will be the last , ' he says . But next season he is back demanding more land in the name of the Great White Father in Washington ! I tell you , brothers , this can not go on , or the red man will have not even a rock on which to lay his head or a bearskinto shield him from the chilling winds of winter . It is cold , brothers , in the winter moons north of the Ohio . Great snow blankets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warm skins are a necessity to sustain life . Yet the white man drives the animals off with no thought for the wants of the Indian women and children ! " Everyone who heard Tecumseh 's words was moved by what he said . Soon the whole town was buzzing with excitement ! By the time the climactic time of the celebration arrived , Tecumseh was the outstanding attraction of the gathering . Many neighboring villagers had come to par/ticipate in the corn ceremony . A huge crowd had gathered and the town took on an even more gala air . Tecumseh was accorded an opportunity to discuss his confederation before a general council of Creek headmen . For two solid hours he recited the ills that had been foisted upon the Indians . As he waxed dramatic he was encouraged by approving shouts from his listeners , who liked what he said , not realizing they were succumbing to his magic spell . As his excited listeners gave vent to louder shouts of approval , Tecumseh became a flaming spirit ! His normally smiling hazel eyes blazed as with fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but deep pits of boiling lava ! Yet his words were not wild and irresponsible ; they were reasoned , logical , and impelling ! The intensity and terror of his voice hurled his words with constant , staccato-like rapidity straight into the brains and hearts of all who heard him , engendering the same flaming resentment he himself felt . Not only did he make them share fully his prolific hatred of the cursed invader , but he caused them to experience his own choking frustration . " All that has made life good for the Indian is being taken from him ! They steal his land , they drive off his game , they dissipate the manhood of his strong young men with their firewater , they destroy his happiness , they kill his spirit , they take away his self-respect , they squeeze out his very will to pursue his way of life ! " But when he lowered his voice and held out to them hope for the future  --  said to them in strangely appealing tones : " All is not yet lost "  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we stand together we have the power to stop them ! But we must stand together and fight together . There is no other way . " The confederation , at that moment , became a vivid , living reality in the mind of every person within sound of his mighty voice ! He made it sound feasible , sensible , and sure to materialize . When he referred to the divine guidanceoffered the red people through his brother , The Prophet of the Lakes , as he called him , it was n't hard for the Creeks to believe that the Master of Life had chosen Ternskwatawahto be , as Tecumseh put it , " a sacred vessel through which to dispense his power and justices to his red children ! "  |p282Tecumseh  and his proposed confederation and his prophet brother became , at that moment , an incarnation of a sublimedream which his hearers wanted so much to come true . The Indians of the early nineteenth century , listeningwith their hearts as those magic voices proclaimed a new day for their race , found the Shawnee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the desperation of despair ! When he ended his inspired oration and resumedhis seat , none realized how long Tecumseh had spoken . Expressions of agreement and support were heard on all sides . Indian morale in the face of a superior culture was never higher ! No one present at Tuckabatchee on the Tallapoosa that day would have conceded that Indian occupancyof their native land was fast coming to an end and that that land was destined to become new horizons to envision and new worlds to conquer for a successor people with a destiny of greater service to the Great Mystery of Life ! Following the adjournment of the council and after the people had regained a semblance of normalcy , the festive activities resumed in earnest . Food abounded in huge quantities . Games were played , contests held , dances presented and various forms of entertainment displaced the serious and somber considerations of the council . Metamoris and Jim Bluejacket had never seen so much excitement and merriment in their lives ! " These southerners really let themselves go  --  they really celebrate , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're mighty right about that , " Metamoris agreed , equally impressed . " When they have fun , they do n't stand around and watch the others do it ! Each has his own . " Their amazement , however , did not prevent them from excelling , along with Tecumseh , in the contests of skill.  |p283Always  there were admiring groups of gaily bedecked girls and enthusiastic throngs of shouting children to lend color to the sporting activities . The commanding , handsome figure of the great chief and the similarly striking appearancesof his younger companions created quite a stir among the female population of the town . As a result , the particularactivities in which all or any of the northern visitors competed invariably brought out a considerable number of the fairer sex . They would stand by silently , but wide-eyed , with startled " ahs " and " ohs " sweeping through their ranks as one of the intriguing strangers performed an especially commendable feat ! This was followed by the usual amount of giggling and rib-poking , blushing and teasing each other about the handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed among the maidens concerning some future event of the celebration . The visitorswere too busily engaged to catch the obvious drift of the lively female chatter . Even though the two youths could not understand the Muscogee dialect , a concentration on the antics of the gay maidens would have provided a strong hint as to things to come that the maidens contemplatedso avariciously . Perhaps they were too timid to look around or perhaps the courage of the wilderness trail had deserted them before these laughing , teasing , gleaming maidens ! Tecumseh might have known what was up . If he did notice and if he did hear the oft-expressed conjectures of the maidens he deemed it prudent not to reveal that fact  --  either to the maidens or to his companions . The day 's feasting and funmaking were followed that night by fire-circle dancing and storytelling . Again the visitors were shown much deference by the celebrants , especial attention coming from the young women . Metamorisfinally forced himself to take cognizance of this disturbingfact . He reflected uncomfortably on some of the customs which Tecumseh long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His emotions were intermingled as he rehashed experiences his older friend had related . Natural inclinations led him to hope he might stumble into such a situation . Shyness at the contemplation of such customs , foreign to his own tribesmen , combined with the inherent longing for the strange princess back on thep284Wapihani , caused him to shrink from any action that might encourage such a custom to materialize around him . The friendly looks and inviting smiles of the sultry maidens had not gone entirely unnoticed by Young Jim , either , for his sudden interest indicated to Metamoris that he was unaware of the strange practices available to or expected of visitors in some places . He was beginning to single out certain of the more attractive maidens , leading Metamoristo surmise he would readily adjust to any strange custom involving the fair ones  --  up to a certain point ! In such an extreme situation Metamoris had no more idea what young Jim Bluejacket would do than he himself ! Tecumseh was busy on into the night conversing with various chiefs , so that Metamoris had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or what might lie ahead as the celebration progressed . The next sun saw a continuation of the festive activities , with feasting and merriment everywhere . Ritualistic dances designed to gain favor with the growing and harvest deities were performed . Both men and women participated in these prayer ceremonies . Late afternoon brought one of the climaxes of the celebration . A huge circle of people was formed , enclosing the central area of the village . A considerable commotion developed , accompanied by shouts of instruction , peals of laughter , and playful scuffles among the young and unmarried braves . During prolonged confusionall the single males were , either voluntarily or forcibly , herded into the huge circle . Other activities ceased as everyone jammed the outer circle to witness this newest performance . From their position on the sidelines Tecumseh and his companions observed curiously the preparations and shufflingfor position among the young men in the circle . Thep285scene became more electrified with suspense as the minutes passed . " This event is something special for sure , " Metamoris uttered in an undertone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's up , Father ? " Young Jim asked , turning to Tecumseh . There was a wry , slight smile on Tecumseh 's face as he answered : " Do n't know for sure . But I can hazard one guess  --  whatever it is , you will find it highly entertaining ! " " Something tells me you know more about this than you 're letting on . " Metamoris spoke suspiciously , casting an accusing eye at his Shawnee mentor . " No , no , really , I ca n't tell for sure  --  I 've got an idea  --  but , well , let 's just wait and see . " By now a large group of young women were congregated together on one side of the circle . They were tremendously interested in this particular game or event , concentrating their attention on the young men in the inner circle . Metamoris ' mounting suspense turned into a premonition of trouble ! Consequently , he sought to make himself as inconspicuousas possible . As the noisy commotion began to die down , a disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three strangers were seated . Several of the girls began pointing toward the visitors , laughing loudly , as more and more took up the strain of the new hullabaloo . Metamoris ' anxiety turned into self-consciousness as he felt all eyes turned in their direction . The shouting increased and the younger men were at a loss to interpret its meaning , not being sufficiently familiar with the dialect as to understand the hastily yelled taunts . " What is the matter with them now ? What are they hollering at us about ? " Young Jim asked Tecumseh nervously . " They want us  --  if we are unmarried  --  to get into the circle with the others , " he replied calmly . " What for ? " Jim asked , his curiosity thoroughly aroused . " We 'll soon see ! " Tecumseh still did not display any outward sign that he was familiar with the cause of the maidens ' agitation or the consequences of their own commandinvitation to enter the circle.  | " We 're all in that class  --  unmarried , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've never seemed to be married ! I never saw you with a wife ! But what do they want us in there for ? " Tecumseh laughed lowly . " I 'm not married  --  at least , not for a long while ! How about you , Young Jim , you married ? " " Me ? You know well I 'm not , " Jim replied indignantly . " You 're not either , are you , Metamoris ? " Tecumseh asked , as he turned slightly to smile at the young chief . " Are you joking ? " Metamoris retorted with a weak smile . Considering the humor the young man recognized to be contained in the question , his smile would have been stronger , except for the painful reflection that but for his walking out on the wedding he was supposed to have had , he would now be safely and happily married . " Then you 'd better be prepared to forget that maiden of yours for a while , if my intuition tells me anything ! " " You mean  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Creek chiefs stepped up in front of them and asked , " Are you men married or unmarried ? " Metamoris had a good idea what was asked , but his courage would have failed even if he could have answered . Tecumseh replied perfunctorily , " Unmarried ! " " Then you will step out into the circle with the others ! " Shrugging his shoulders resignedly , Tecumseh arose and stepped into the inner circle , motioning for his companions to follow . The girls , strangely silent during the discourse between the chief and Tecumseh , began to whoop with more glee than before . As the three northerners joined the males in the circle a loud command scattered the eligible ones around the half circle , where they seated themselves at random on the grass , apparently not to interfere with the vision of the bystanders behind them . Silence suddenly descended upon the vast assemblage and it contrasted pointedly to the former noisy din . The ominous quiet was almost frightening , Metamoris thought , pressing himself against his mother earth , his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself inconspicuous . The stillness hanging like a mysterious cloud over the great circle was shattered by the sound of drums some/where behind the spectators . They beat a rapid staccato , low at first , but increasing in tempo until it became a crescendoshaking the very ground upon which the unmarried men reclined . As the drums reached their climax , an openingappeared in the ranks of the maidens across the circle from the expectant males . As the girls fell back on both sides , a maiden entered the circle through the opening and , in graceful , dancing motion , moved out into the center facing the reclining males . Behind her marched the drummers , four in number , who spread out in a single line , standing back close to the wide-eyed observers . The ranks of the maidens closed as tightly as before the dramatic entrance . The dancing girl was a breathtaking sight ! She was clad in a scanty , gaily-colored costume , adorned with every kind of gaudy , eye-catching ornament that could be attached . In fact , the native jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-brown skin than the abbreviated strip of deerskin fitting tightly around her swaying , constantlymoving hips ! From the much ornamented , bouncing deerskin up she was entirely bare except for a neckband from which hung many colored beads and a white , fluffyhairedadornment that jiggled up and down with her otherwise unconcealed breasts ! Her arms and legs were bare , except for various kinds of wrist and ankle bracelets which glittered and jingled noisily as those ever-moving members soared through the air or cavorted around the circle . The girl 's raven-black hair hung loosely down her back , after first being secured at her head by silver-colored clasps . A graceful narrow silver band encircled her lovely forehead . Her pure-white teeth gleamed as a broad smile and various suggestive expressions lit up her comely face , painted to accentuate the natural beauty of its perfectly formed features . It was n't hard to surmise that here was the pick of the village maidens and that she was demonstratingher many attributes as proof of her right to this enviable distinction ! Miantonomah had come of age ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had won the coveted privilege of dancing the much anticipated Creek sex dance , the dancing of which was a highly sought-after prize among the young females just joining the ranks of maidens avail/able to be courted and wed ! This dance was an age-old tradition and was danced in the same way , with the same ultimate results , year after year . The maiden chosen each year to perform the dance at the corn-planting festival was always the outstanding maiden in the " coming of age " group that year . This group did not necessarily representany definite age but covered an approximate sixteen-to **29;5398;TOOLONG bracket , depending on the physical development or maturity of the maiden . It was the time most nearly representing the entering into womanhood and constituted an unofficial announcement of intention to do and be what nature decrees a female should do and be in life ! So Miantonomah , who , at last , had become a woman , had earned the right to dance the tribal sex dance for this season , the highest honor that could come to any Muscogee maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex of the Indian woman . Symbolically , she pictured the basic female impulses toward mating experienced upon reaching maturity . By her graceful movements and poses she suggested realistically the motivations of the young woman as she seeks a mate , tracing the progress of that search and revealing the ultimate results of the man hunt . Her dancing boldly portrayed the raw sexual urgings within every maiden , stripping aside the veil of modesty and displayingfearlessly , passionately , her intimate longings as she searches with every fibre of her desperate being for a lover ! The dance unfolded in fanciful frankness the journey each maiden makes through the towns and forests , along the endless trails of life , seeking a mate who will satisfy her consuming need with an equally violent enthusiasm , matching her fullest capacity for loving ! But Miantonomah danced for a purpose  --  a far greater purpose to her than merely dramatizing the awakening sex life of the Indian female at the tender , fierce stage of blossomed maturity , a far better purpose than playing a role to entertain those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maiden of the year . Miantonomah danced to obtain a lover and a husband in fact , as well as in fanciful pantomime ! For , at the end of the sex dance of the Muscogee it was traditional for the maiden to choose one of the unmarried men in thep290circle as her lover and , ostensibly , her husband ! She accomplishesthis purpose amid a rolling climax of drum beats by ending her dramatic portrayal of dancing skill and awakened passion before the man of her choice ! During this thrilling conclusion to the dance she prostrates herself on the ground before him in humble , complete submissionto her man ! The happy couple are then escorted by the joyful multitudeto the marriage lodge prepared for them . There they retire and remain together in uninterrupted seclusion for the remainder of the day and the night ! The next day they are publicly acclaimed as husband and wife by timehonoredtribal ceremonies  --  unless the chosen male appears before the highest council of elders and renounces his inherentright and sacred responsibility to wed the maiden ! Only if he has a prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally good reason , will he be permitted to decline the high honor accorded him by the sexdancemaiden . Failing to perform was next to unknown , so sought after were these far-famed dancers of the sex dance ! Miantonomah paused in the center of the circle as she faced the admiring , eager gazes of the group from which she must choose the recipient of her maidenhood ! Humbly she paused for a moment , her arms hanging loosely and gracefully at her side , her body drooping slightly , provocatively , as the drummers momentarily ceased their measured pounding . She was a truly beautiful , inspiring sight , representingthe ultimate that could be sexually appealing and hedonic in Indian womanhood ! As the drummers began another lively beat , Miantonomahswung into her daring portrayal of the dance ! No loud whoops or whistles or shouts of encouragement greeted the frank , unconcealed mating invitation of her exotic movements . The assembled multitude watched in choking silence , except for the resounding accompaniment of the drums . Gracefully she unfolded the symbolic panorama of the dance , telling the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first awakening consciousness of sexual impulses . By her lithe actions , moving around the circle in tempo with the drums , she demonstrated the coming of the maiden to the time of realization that this strange ,  |p291tense  urging within can only be assuaged by the intimate companionship of a man in her life ! The dancing maiden hesitated , striking a provocative pose like a trembling young doe , sleek and graceful , ready to run or ready to stand , but emphasizing above all else that sex has suddenly becomethe overpowering influence in her life ! A quizzical expression on her face contemplates her prospects of acquiring a mate . As her body maintained its openly challengingposition  --  head high , shoulders straight , feet slightly apart  --  the deepening frown on her pretty features indicated the studious nature of her deliberations . Everythingabout her denoted plainly that her contemplation is not whether to take a mate , but how  --  what mode of feminineguile nature has endowed her with to employ to make her conquest overwhelming and satisfying ! After much inner struggling , skillfully suggested by clever manipulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . She has " found herself , " discoveringher whole latent , potential reservoir of talents for attracting the male of her choice . Growing confidence arises , one can see , in her ability to secure a mate who will smother her flaming desires and , in turn , be inspired by her own freely to be offered sensual capacities . Each new twist and strut exhibits her mounting confidence that whatever nature has decreed to be for her will be ! A plan of attack now formulated , her actions indicate she is ready to set out on her all-important mission in life  --  a vigorous , confidentsearch for conjugal destiny ! Thus , Miantonomah began her figurative journey to find a husband ! She strutted proudly at first , her body bent far back at the waist , her legs alternately raised high with each step . As she moved gracefully along in the strange silence gripping the vast assemblage , her hands anchored confidently on her hips , raised imploringly over her lovely head , or extended invitingly in front of the forwardthrust of her pert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued to the world her announcement of intention to find and take a mate ! These bold and seeminglyrapacious actions disclosed that she sought a male who would test his manly prowess against her newly acquiredwomanly capacities  --  to determine his fitness for the honor she had to bestow . Miantonomah would conferp292her virginal charms gladly , freely surrendering her heretoforezealously guarded secrets ! But , since this was a game for love and life , they must be given to a man of her own choosing and one worthy of this idyllic bliss ! Without warning , she leaped high in the air , fiercely calling for a lover , exhibiting in forceful realism the long pent-up , now released animal fury within her that demandedsatisfaction beyond the capability of a flowering maiden 's human reason either to stifle or control ! Ashamed of her inner urging to gratify her sexual longings ? Not this maiden who danced the time-honored sex dance of the Muscogee ! Rather , she was proud and went about the task of selecting the fortunate male in a calculating , dominatingfashion . Next she kneeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contoured body , which was twisted in such a way as to further accentuate the idea of invitation to a prospective candidate for her love . The wild , challenginglook in eyes suddenly become fiery with passion made this a compelling pose , for a ripple of unbelieving awe rolled through the crowd , which reacted vocally for the first time to the sensuality of the performance  --  yet no ribald or impolite sounds escaped the mouths of the enthralled bystanders . Miantonomah had proved herself ! She was a huge success as the annual sex dancer . Her confidence increasedas she moved swiftly , cautiously , alertly around the circle once , twice again , darting piercing glances first this way , then that . When she halted , it was with such a languorous , suffering expression as to manifest unmistakablythe importance , yes , the absolute necessity of sex to the Indian woman ! Shifting quickly , she assumed a more commanding , defiantposition with one leg well forward , the other to the side , slightly back . Her face was contorted in an expression of rugged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elbows , and fingers thrust forward , she testified plainly that when this maiden , now all woman , gets her man in her arms she 'll hold him so tightly and so bind him to her that he 'll never get away ; moreover , that she 'll defend him to the death from any other designing female ! After that symbolic announcement to the world the search is resumed , and in earnest , as shep293becomes hot on the trail ! Leaning forward from the hips and gazing intently at the tracks ahead she senses the presence nearby of the game she is hunting  --  one who might be the mate she desperately seeks ! At this point Miantonomah made a gesture to the recliningmen within the circle to arise for her piercing , critical , personal estimation . As they eagerly responded , jumping to their feet , she weaved agilely among them , swaying in time with the now soft beat of the drums . She inspected this one , smiled broadly at another , performed some particularly enticing twist of her hips or exciting motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reactions to her ensnaring guiles . If the brave indicatedhis ready willingness to succumb , or moved to enfoldher trim figure in his outstretched arms , Miantonomah was n't there ! Like a vapor she drifted out of his reach , moving on easily to another . Reaching the vicinity of Tecumseh and his two breathless , younger companions , Miantonomah glided effortlessly up before Metamoris , the first of the three in the line . She hesitated for a brief instant , but never really stopped , moving by him like a swan on a smooth pond . At the same time she accorded the startled young man a piercing look that none but he could see , one that sent a stabbing pain into the very marrow of his bones ! As he nonchalantly attempted to conceal the effect of her close presence and of her searching gaze boring into him , he felt suddenly dizzy , imagining that every eye around the huge circle was aware of his confusion . If the ground had swallowed him at that moment it would have been a welcome development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the straight figure of the Shawnee chieftain , whose near six feet towered over her small , tantalizingfigure . No trace of emotion was registered on Tecumseh'scalm features . He gazed intently at the maiden . Her eyes traveled the entire length from his moccasined feet to his cropped scalp lock . Sighing plaintively , her arms went out to him in a beseeching gesture . However , she remained well out and away from the possible grasp of his powerful arms , while her gaze remained fastened upon his handsome figure . Thus she indicated the admiration all Indian womanhood must feel for this great and goodp294leader of his people , while attesting to his strong appeal to the love instinct . Miantonomah was not engaged in entertaining visiting dignitaries today ! This was the most polite tribute she could pay the great Shawnee , the most respectful rejection any man could receive ! Next she halted before the consternated form of Young Jim . Jim was all shook up  --  showing it plainly ! Smiling broadly , she touched her fingers against his bare chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest to his neck , then to the back of his head and up to his scalp lock , which her fingers stroked gently several times . Young Jim could n't move  --  so petrified was he . The more personal attention the bewitching maiden accorded him , the more confused Young Jim became , and the more broadly Miantonomah smiled ! Well she knew there was no danger of Young Jim sweeping her into his strong arms , despite his likely inner urging to do just that . He could n't have moved a muscle and Miantonomah knew it ! As quickly as she had come , she glided away . Completing her journey among the eligible candidates , she weaved back and forth among them once more , hastily , then returned to her former position in the unoccupied half circle . Here she put the finishing touches on her performance , indicating by her motions that she had made her choice and demonstrating in a convincing manner what she intended to do about it ! By successive poses and twisting , writhing actions she graphically divulged her willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arms extended wide , feet planted well apart and body bent backward , she proclaimed the end of her long , strenuousand , at last , fruitful search . Then , just as abruptly as she had performed her entire dancing pantomime , she changed her whole characterization . The sweating , sufferingprospective husbands before her could n't believe their own eyes ! All at once she was the contented , proper female ready to throw herself humbly at the feet of her husband in purring submissiveness ! Could this sweet little bundle of modesty be the wild little ball of fire who had incited them so mercilessly a few seconds before ? They knew it was , for while the role had changed , the strong sex yearningwas magnified in their distraught senses , so mightily ( lid this new Miantonomah  --  goddess of femininity  --  draw them to her in intoxicating emotion ! The drums ceased ! Silence  --  more heavy and ominous than at any previous time during the dance  --  reigned over a scene rapidly approaching its zenith of excitement . The tremendous suspense of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearfully , over participants and spectators alike . This was a game the Creeks enjoyed immensely and anticipated with glee each year . Every unmarried Muscogee warrior within the circle hoped fervently to be chosen  --  to realize the dream-cometrueexperience of sharing the marriage wigwam with this uninhibited and captivating creature ! Several of them had grown up with this maiden , possibly never realizing beforehow attractive she really was and now secretly wishingthey had courted her more convincingly beforehand . Others had already made inquiry of her father , seeking a marriage arrangement . But just now all the hopefuls stood stiff and strained , unless , indeed , it was Tecumseh , as they waited for the fateful decision . The Shawnee 's broad experience in the field of female relations , plus his keen observations , provided him a hint of what was coming . Still he said nothing to his companions . This moment was the maiden 's ! He reflected that powerful love spirits would be directing her decision , since her inspired performancehad undoubtedly moved her as much as the vast audience before whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drums lashed out into another awful booming roll . Quick as a flash , Miantonomah moved up to the group of young men , glided confidently , easily , back through the ranks and stopped in front of the tall , princely figure of Metamoris ! She threw herself flat on the ground before the Delaware youth , her arms entwined around the calves of his legs , her cheeks pressed tightly to his shins ! Metamoris felt a sick numbnesssweep through him , replaced by a momentary flash of thrilling exhaltation , swiftly followed by a choking sensation of incomprehensibility ! Consternation broke loose all over the place ! The crowd surged in toward the scene of this unexpected and colorful high point of the entire cornplantingcelebration of the Creek nation . They pushedp296and shoved , tugged and pulled , literally climbing over each other in their frenzy to get close to the famous couple ! Metamoris stood stunned and unmoving , the maiden still prostrate at his feet . Since he neither understood the shouts hailed at him from every side nor recognized the plain motions to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then came Tecumseh shoving people aside to reach his young friend . " Assist the maiden to arise ! " he shouted into Metamoris ' ear above the din of the roaring crowd . Meekly , Metamoris obeyed . As he set the maiden on her feet the uproar increased in volume . Miantonomah clung tenaciously to his arm and her smiling face looked up proudly and eagerly into his . In helpless uncertainty he looked about him at the laughing , shouting faces , then back at the glowing countenance of the dancing maiden clinging to him with a fierce abandon that matched the wild recklessness of her sex dance . She had eyes and attentionfor nothing or no one but him . " Tecumseh , " he shouted , turning to his widely grinning companion , " what is all this ? They act like they think we have been married ! " The Shawnee , who by this time was aware of the full significance of the sex-dance tradition , replied , shouting above the uproar , " You guessed right , Son . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glanced down at the radiant face of the maiden . Despite the tensenessof the situation and the startling implication of Tecumseh'swords , instinctively he smiled back at her . This pleased the maiden very much ! By now the crowd , pressing vigorously , jostled them along in one direction . Metamoris felt the maiden slip under his arm  --  for protection from the onslaught of the crowd , he surmised . To Tecumseh , who walked at his other side , he spoke above the shouts of the pressing townspeople . " Do n't tell me they marry you down here without telling you beforehand  --  don'tthey ask you if you 're already pledged to another ? " " I suppose these fellows knew what to expect . I had a good idea , but I did n't know the details , " Tecumseh shouted back.  | " Why did n't you tell me , then , " Metamoris rejoined in desperation , at the same time holding the maiden tightly against him as he bounced along . " I did n't want to spoil your surprise . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ! Anyway , you 're not pledged to anyone just now , are you ? " Metamoris groaned in exasperation , at the same time placing his free hand on his forehead . Then he stole a quick glance down at his companion , who was tripping along contentedly , but still clinging to him for dear life and paying no attention to the bystanders walking all around them . " But am I really married ? That just wo n't do , you know that ! What about Wynoma ? " he asked  --  and this time in genuine alarm . An amused expression again crossed Tecumseh 's face . " What about her ? " he asked . " You 're the one who should answer that ! " " What 's so funny about this mess , anyway ? And what 's going to happen now  --  that 's what I want to know . " Metamorisgroaned . " Metamoris , my son , you are a very fortunate young man ! I envy you  --  so does every male in this place . You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleep with her  --  merciful spirits above . Then I am really married to her ! " He paused long enough to cast another bewildered look down at the lovely figure of Miantonomahclinging to him so tightly she felt almost like part of his own body . " This is awful ! Say , is this one of those crazy things you said happened to you down here ? A little harmless fun is one thing , but marrying you off like this  --  ugh ! Maybe you got me into this , you dog ! " Tecumseh roared with laughter , his bright eyes sparkling as he answered , " My son , I would n't have been standing out there secretly asking the Great Spirit to cause her to select me if I 'd planned to have her pick you ! " Once again Metamoris looked down at his clinging shadow . As he did so , she looked up . Their eyes met and they exchanged friendly smiles . " She is n't exactly hard to look at , is she ? " " Oh , no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek nation  --  that 's all ! " Tecumseh observed emphatically , " not hard to look at , at all ! " " What are all these people taking such an interest in it for ? " " It 's a tradition . As I get it , you are expected to sleep with her tonight " As an afterthought he added : " You called me a dog . You 're the dog , you lucky dog !  --  for tonight , at least ! Tomorrow you will be considered married to her . I think there are some strings attached to it , though . I 'll find out for sure and let you know . In the meantime , if I were in your place I would Iet tomorrow take care of itself and live today and tonight as it comes ! " " But I ca n't even talk to her ! I do n't understand her language . " " Since when does love need words to effect its glorious purposes ? " Tecumseh asked in exaggerated , eyebrowraisingtones . Metamoris groaned in bewilderment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it would happen to me like this  --  get myself married down here before I even look at a maiden ! If she was n't so beautiful and appealing I would have been glad if she had chosen you ! Then I would have been doing the laughing . " He glanced down again at the scantily-clad female , while Tecumseh convulsed with merriment . The whole conversation had been carried on at the tops of their voices , to be heard above the gleeful , happy crowd surging around them . As they approached a newly picture-painted tepee Metamoris added : " I 've got just enough good sense and human weakness both to decide your advice is sound  --  in fact , I think I 'd go through with it even if you did n't approve ! " Tecumseh 's amusement knew no bounds . Once more he laughed hilari-ously ! They were halted before the tepee . There , painted on the skin of the tepee was a sketch of an Indian brave and his newly acquired wife holding hands and gazing fondly at each other . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western trees . For a moment all was confusion . A chief stepped up and drew back the flap of the tepee in a ceremonious manner . Then manyp299hands roughly and forcefully pushed Metamoris and Miantonomahwithin . The flap was lowered , and the crowd , after milling around in playful glee for a while , gradually drifted away . The next morning Metamoris was summoned before the head chief of the town . Tecumseh accompanied him to act as his interpreter and to safeguard his young friend 's interests . One other Indian was present . This was Black Fox , the father of Miantonomah . The chief motioned for them to be seated . After a lighted pipe had been passed around several times the elder chief asked in a kindly , but firm voice : " My son , is it your intention to make the maiden your lifelong wife ? " Tecumseh passed along the message to Metamoris . " How much easier , " Metamoris thought , " and perhaps better all around , considering what a tragedy I 've made of my love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact as in deed ! She is everything any brave could want in a wife  --  more than he should expect ! Besides , it would help Tecumseh 's cause among the Creeks considerably ! " But the haunting restlessness of the old love for Wynoma flashed through his distraught senses ! All this passed in lightning review as he sat before the old chief , who patiently awaited his reply . Summing the strength to speak what must be said and hating himself for saying it , he began his delicate declination . Tecumseh translated . " My father , if things were different you would not have had to summon me here for an answer to that question ! I would have been found before the maiden 's father 's lodge earlier this morning  --  requesting to complete whatever ceremony was necessary to make Miantonomah my wife ! I could accept the maiden gladly for a wife ! " At this pointp300he turned to Black Fox and said : " To you , the father of the maiden , I say that your chest may swell with pride at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor to your tribe and to all the red people ! Her beauty and dancing are unexcelled ! Her purity and goodness are unquestioned ! I , above all others , testify that this is true ! If it were possible I would be most happy to take her to wife . " Addressing the grave , imposing figure of the head chief , he continued : " Father , listen attentively to me . You have observed that neither I nor my companions are married . There is a reason for this . We travel throughout this great land tellingthe red-skinned people of the grave danger confrontingthem and rallying them to a united defense of their lands . We are constantly on the move , from moon to moon , making long journeys , returning to our own towns only during the cold moons of winter . Even then we must be in the woods hunting the scarce game to keep our people from starving . We have no time for wives ! It would be unfair to the wives and unfair to the service we owe our people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we to think with two minds instead of one ! I have already placed behind me the maiden of my choice among my own people ! Father , I say to you , and to the father of this maiden , I must decline the high honor bestowed upon me  --  to marry this rare Creek jewel , this true princess of the Indian people ! " A grave silence followed the delivery of this speech . Tecumseh leaned over and whispered to Metamoris , " Excellentargument . I could n't have done so well myself ! " A carefully veiled snort was the only response to what Metamoris detected was a compliment with a touch of humorous irony . " Of course , I did n't say it would relieve you , you understand , " Tecumseh added softly . Failing to see any humor in the matter , Metamoris stared straight ahead , awaiting a reply he hoped would release him from his obligation . After consultation with Black Fox , the head chief replied gravely . " Our distinguished guest has spoken well ! His reason is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not release him from the solemn tradition of our law , whichp301recognizes that every brave needs a faithful wife and is a better warrior or hunter if he has the comforts of a wife ! No reason save prior intention to wed another shall releasethe brave from his sacred ties to the maiden who has chosen him in our ancient , respected ceremony of the sex dance ! Since the young chief has rejected his first choice of a wife  --  no matter what the reason  --  he has no prior intention to marry another and can not qualify for the exception ! " Too late Metamoris realized his mistake . While the rejectionof Wynoma would indicate his desire to remain single , yet it took away the only acceptable reason by Muscogee law . He would have to shift his strategy fast ! The sharp look in Tecumseh 's eyes only accentuated that salient fact . " My father , " he said , launching out anew , " I have not fully understood the nature of the tradition and the laws of your nation . The dance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its solemn significance . Your fathers have handed it down to you because it embodies all that is decent and good in the natural relationship of man and woman . I am a guest in your midst . As such , I have been honored beyond the desserts of any stranger . The flower of your nation has offered to become my wife . She has given herself freely in the highest spirit of your tradition . It was her duty to make her choice . I could only reject her on one ground and that is the reason your fathers wisely made the exception to the rule of the sex dance  --  prior intention to wed another . This wise rule was made to prevent injustice to the heart of the maiden  --  and to the heart of another maiden , no doubt ! Metamoris found it difficult to pause often enough and long enough to allow Tecumseh to interpret his words . Frequently , Tecumseh raised his hand slightly to slow him up . Yet , the Shawnee was doing an effective job of conveyinghis message to the Creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " I have said that I have a prior choice among my own people . That is true ! I do not doubt that she awaits my return . But , if she did n't , I would have no cause to complain . I have placed her aside for only a season . I have never intendedp302other than to return and claim her . My elder brother will speak the truth of what I say , if you will question him ! " He ceased speaking . Immediately the chief and Black Fox conferred in low voices . Metamoris scarcely dared to breathe as the two conversed . Tecumseh sensed the situation far too tense now for any whispered comment . Silently he waited with Metamoris for the next development . Finally , the chief turned to reply . " Black Fox spoke of this matter to his daughter before coming here . She is well pleased with the young man of her choice . She believed there might be another maiden in the young chief 's life , so she authorized her father to ask him this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadly at his worried companion . " Will the Delaware chieftain consider placing two wives in his lodge ? If he would , Miantonomah is willing to share her husband 's affections . She will accompany him north to his people now , or later . She will share peacefully his lodge with another wife and remain behind dutifully when he travels . " This was an angle Metamoris had n't anticipated and he was stunned momentarily . He reflected that the two maidens so important in his life had more in common than just the similarity of their names . " Surely , " he reflected , " this is a quality all females possess or , at least , the ones I am destined to get involved with . " He shook his head and sighed deeply . " If I never marry , " he told himself ironically , " it wo n't be because these strange maidens have n't done their best to confuse the matter ! " Then he glared sternly at the amused countenance of Tecumseh as he groped for the proper answer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much experience with females all over the land , perhaps you can tell me how to answer them now , " he suggested  --  his voice displaying pure irony unadulterated by humor . " Now that you ask it , I must say I ca n't remember runninginto just this exact situation , " Tecumseh replied , still smiling in obvious enjoyment of his young friend 's predicament . " But if I were in your place  --  which I 'm glad I 'm not  --  this morning  --  last night would have been a differentmatter . Well , anyway , I think I would marry bothp303maidens  --  keep one in the north , the other in the south ; then divide my time between them  --  summers in the north , winters in the southlands where it 's warm and pleasant ( luring the cold moons ! " " You 're a big help , you are , " Metamoris growled in exasperation , a scowl gracing his worried face . A moment later the humor of Tecumseh 's keen remark sank in on him and he smiled sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded ever so slightly in approval as Metamoris answered in words fulfilling the confidence the Shawnee leader held in him . " Father , for the first time , I can see some merit in the custom of plural marriage , which I understand to be practicedby some tribes . Evidently it is accepted here or the maiden would not have proposed it . It is practically unknownamong the Lenni-Lenape . I oppose it on the grounds that one wife or the other will be preferred and favored  --  resulting in unhappiness for the other and bad feeling between the two sets of children . Maintaining wives in different places is deceitful and treacherous , leading to misunderstanding and heartbreak . I cling to the view that marriage is a mutual undertaking with equal obligation on both sides . It has been argued by wise men that by nature a woman might more readily accommodate two men than a husband satisfy two wives . If I were to accept plural marriages , I should be more inclined to advocate the former  --  but no matter , I am opposed to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miantonomah agrees to share the lodge of her husband with another  --  such as Wynoma , for instance "  --  he turned to look at Tecumseh as he said it  --  " then the joy of marrying two wives must necessarily be a great temptation to any man ! " Tecumseh nodded in decided agreement and he was n't smiling this time . Metamoris summed up his case . He must prevail or lose on this argument , for their was nothing more to say . " Father , I can not accept the generous offer , which I know to be inspired by the noblest motive  --  that of enabling two people so suited to each other as Miantonomah and I to know the joys of a happy married life ! But I can not , nor will I , forget the interests of one whose claims on my affections precedes those of this one who will live in myp304thoughts as long as the Great Spirit gives me power to remember ! " A glance between the two Creeks was enough . The chief arose and closed the hearing abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ceremonyhas been satisfied . We do not require the testimony of Tecumseh . Your word is highly valued among us . You are not considered the husband of Miantonomah . Go your way in peace , though you and your companions are welcome to remain among us . We believe the cause you serve to be a worthy one and we will support it with warriors to fight under your command ! " Both Tecumseh and Metamoris read in this last pronouncementthe success of their mission , but also a veiled suggestion that they should depart from the town because of the sex-dance development . As they returned to their quarters they reflected on the implication of the rejection on their efforts . " I fear my actions have damaged your chance for warriorsupport from the Creeks ! I 'm very sorry ! I wanted to help , not hinder ! " " Do n't worry about it . If their decision to aid us was no stronger than that they would never have come through anyway . A little thing like rejection of a marriage custom could not prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most miserable man alive  --  any way you look at it ! " " I know , my son , believe me . I know how you feel  --  about everything  --  the tradition of the dance , Miantonomah herself , and  --  Wynoma , too ! " He placed his hand reassuringlyon his friend 's shoulder . " It will work out in time . You 'll see ! I 've had these crushing experiences . Once , there was a white maiden in my life  --  my Star of the Lake ! I had to make a choice  --  the woman I loved  --  the only one  --  or the cause of my people ! It was hard ! I made the decision and lived through it . So will you ! Who knows ! Yours may turn out better than mine in the end . " They lapsed into silence the rest of the way , each locked in his own thoughts . Arriving at the bark-covered guest lodge they were met by an anxious Young Jim . He was pacing back and forth as if in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly.  | " Let 's get packed , Jim , and move on to other towns , " Tecumseh said simply , ignoring his inquiry . He hoped Young Jim would let it go at that . He did n't ! " But what about the marriage ? What about the maiden ? " he blurted out . When there was no immediate answer , he added : " I 've been able to pick up enough of their language , and by use of signs , to find out that the people around here consider it a binding marriage that must stick . " " You hear wrong ! " replied Metamoris , as he checked his few meager belongings in preparation for the departure . " We are leaving now and I am still single ! " " But what of the maiden ? Is n't this kind of rough on her ? She intended to marry you  --  and did so according to the customs of her people . You were committed to it , whether you understood it or not ! Not only that , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening and night making love to her ! Does n't that make you married to her  --  either by Creek law or Delaware ? I think it does ! " " You are wrong , Jim Bluejacket , " Metamoris replied bluntly . " I agreed to no marriage and did not consider I was being married ! " He was plainly irritated , but Young Jim was in no mood to notice or care . " But I should think you would be glad to marry a girl like that ! Why do you shame her in this way ? She gave herself to you freely , did n't she ? The least you could do is acknowledge her as your wife , whether you take her along or not ! " Young Jim became more vehement as he went along . " Look , Jim , I 'm sorry about the whole thing and if I 've offended you , I 'm sorry about that , too ! I have a Lenape maiden waiting for me at home . You know that ! " Despite the conciliatory words there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too perturbed to notice the danger sign  --  and too aroused to care . He forged on heedlessly ! " I question whether you even have a maiden waiting on you at home , from what I hear ! But be that as it may  --  what I want to know is  --  what if the dancing maiden becomes of child by you ? " By now Jim was speaking in heated animation . The silence of the guest lodge could have been cut withp306a knife ! Metamoris had been tense for hours . Young Jim 's last jab had kindled the smouldering fire within him to white heat . " What 's that to you ? " he lashed out in a mockingly brutal voice . Like a flash Tecumseh moved between them , speaking calm words to quiet the aroused feelings . " Do n't worry about it , either of you ! The maiden will soon marry . You saw how many anxious suitors she had at the dance , did n't you ? " There was no answer . All three returned to the tasks of rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with an appearance of determined resolve , announcing flatly , " I still think it 's a dirty trick ! I 'll marry her myself ! " " Jim , " Tecumseh said sternly , as he whirled around to confront the riled youth . " Do n't be as soft and weak as a squaw ! Speak not such foolish words ! You have no more use for a wife than have we . You 've spoken your mind  --  bluntly . Now let it drop there before a bad situationgets any worse ! " " I care not what you think of my actions , Father ! If the maiden will marry me I shall wed her immediately . She is very beautiful ! I saw her only that one time and already I feel that she is the only maiden in the world ! I will not see her cruelly betrayed ! " Tecumseh and Metamoris stared at each other in unbelievingamazement ! " Father , " the determined youth insisted , " you will accompanyme to her father 's lodge at once and interpret my proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrug of hopelessness , Tecumseh stepped out of the lodge and motioned for his younger tribesman to follow . How long they were gone Metamoris did n't know , except it seemed exceptionally long . He began to suspect that the ceremony was being performed immediately . Finally , however , the flap raised and Tecumseh reentered , followed closely by the dejected figure of Young Jim . " What did she say ? " Metamoris asked anxiously . Young Jim did n't reply , but flopped down sullenly on his rolled blanket . When Tecumseh saw the youth wouldp307not answer he said , " She said she would marry no one , Creek or any other  --  now ! " " Go on , tell him the rest of what she said ! " Jim insisted vigorously . " That 's the gist of it  --  she said nothing more of consequencethat Metamoris does n't already know . " " Oh , yes she did , and I think it is of consequence . I think he ought to hear it . " " Suppose you just tell me yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly , " Metamoris challenged him . " All right , I will ! She said she could marry no other becauseher heart belongs to only one  --  the one she gave it to along with her body ! " " Thank you , Young Jim , " Metamoris replied in a strangelylow and calm voice . " Thank you very much ! " As they walked out of the village to where their horses were tied , Young Jim muttered a parting remorseful blast : " They should have made you marry her  --  especially after you ran out on the other one ! How many maidens do you intend to leave weeping after you ? " Quick as lightning Metamoris turned and swung a mighty blow at his companion 's face ! But even swifter was Tecumseh'sresponse . The blow landed on his arm , which shielded Young Jim 's surprised and late-ducking face . Stepping quickly between them , Tecumseh grasped each by the arm , shook them fiercely , and led them rapidly down the path . " Do not let me hear another word spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Jim Bluejacket ? " " Yes , Father , I understand . I will obey . " " See that you do ! " So saying , he gave the younger man a decided shove that sent him speeding on ahead a few steps . He released his grip on Metamoris ' arm . Neither of them doubted that he meant what he said !  |p308A|pril  passed and May romped merrily on its prancing journey into the summer of 1808 . Back in Tuckabatchee on the Tallapoosa Miantonomah was picking up the pieces of her shattered life and short-lived , blighted romance . Her little world had been drastically and cruelly changed by the dancing of the sex dance of her people . Honor suddenlyinvolved something other than its usual connotations . Fame had come to her so wondrously , only to be crushed into the dust of the town where she had laid everything at Metamoris ' feet  --  and lost ! She had gambled it all on a wild , reckless hunch and an even wilder , more reckless impulse . In doing so , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ecstatic night , but she lost him as a husband . With him went her fame and honor ! A scorned maiden adjudged to be responsiblefor her own betrayal hardly retained a high place in the tribe  --  especially one who had danced the traditional dance of her people , had been repulsed ignominiously , had given all  --  and lost ! Nevertheless , Miantonomah had danced the skillful , savagedance the way she was expected to do it . In that she did not fail ! The woman within her , whether primitive or refined , had sought to love and be loved by her uninhibitedchoice of the climactic moment  --  a choice designed by tradition and the subtle wisdom of the ages to be made while the maiden was at the height of vigorous , stimulatingmotivation for perfect , idyllic love ! No considerationof the mind , only the compelling force of pure , raw passion , had dictated the selection of the young stranger . That she knew nothing about him only testified to the great measure of success attained in the time-honored objective of the sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ample supply of available men for the virginal favors was a vital factor of the psychological nature of the game . Generations long dead had known that the choice under such circumstances would be one not ponderedover  --  rather a choice of nature , not of reason . It was only in her inability to tie her man so tightly top309her during the course of the rapturous hours together that she had failed . Her disgrace , though not deserved , was inevitable  --  for the populace must have either a hero or a scapegoat in any sport of public demonstration ! Miantonomahdanced and loved with a hope in her mind and an ideal in her far from savage heart ! She stood to gain , as she saw it  --  at the ultimate , the husband of her wildest , most intimate choice  --  at the least , one glorious night in his arms ! The hope was illusory ; the ideal , a reality that would live in a maiden 's heart ! As Tecumseh , Metamoris , and Young Jim wended their way carefully eastward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northlands on a hunting expedition , visiting among their southern brethren . A few days or a few hours in a town and they suddenly became prophets and proclaimers of a new concept of Indian living , paintinga somber picture of the future of the red race if the people did not come together for a common purpose in one mighty , prodigious effort . " Awaken from your slumbers , " Tecumseh cried to the people time and again . His voice echoed across the forestsas his magnetic personality , commanding voice , and flaming eyes invariably won the day . To all appearances he was capturing the support so anxiously sought from these strong southern nations to make possible a great intercontinental confederation of warriors from widely scattered parts of the Indian land ! Tempers had returned to a normal smoothness . Tecumsehwas in good spirits . Young Jim had survived his sympathetic obsession , his resentment toward Metamoris largely gone . Apparently he was reconciled after the dancingmaiden 's refusal of his marriage offer . Only Metamorisseemed not to be his old pleasant self . He wasp310preoccupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days passed his melancholy deepened . Often he lapsed into long periods of silence as the trio moved along the endlesstrails . " What is wrong with you ? " Tecumseh asked one evening in late May as they rode side by side . Young Jim had branched off the main trail to hunt for a wild turkey . " Nothing , nothing at all , " was the reply . " Why do you ask ? " " You 're not yourself ! Something 's bothering you . Which of the maidens is it ? " " There is nothing wrong ! If there were I doubt if I would care to discuss it , anyway . " " Have it your own way , young man , but remember this  --  a man had just as well be married to a woman in fact , as in spirit  --  and it 's usually less trouble to him that way . Consider seriously what I say to you ! " Metamoris remained broodingly silent . Tecumseh judged that one or both of his female interests was weighing on the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he deemed it to be the beauteous Lenape maiden  --  if conscienceonly , he presumed the equally lovely Creek maiden was preying heavily on his mind . It could , of course , be both love and conscience with either of the fair ones . More likely , Tecumseh judged , it was the princess of Wapihani who was asserting herself . The tenderly dangerousaffair back in the Creek town had probably opened doors to suppressed desires formerly locked deeply inside him , enflaming the burning desire for the Delaware maiden . He must now be repenting deeply for having run out on the marriage . Metamoris had never mentioned the nighttime departure from Lapinabit 's village , but news of it had leaked through . Young Jim 's flinging a charge of desertion of the former love was highly untimely and cruel . However , the damage was done , the hurt inflicted  --  and deeply , too , Tecumseh feared , knowing the sensitive nature of the young Grandfather . June , the moon of the summer season , arrived and Metamorisdrew into his shell more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle breezes and the magic of nature 's rhapsody of nocturnal sounds , seemedp311to remove him farther from the world of reality . Tecumseh noted gravely the hebetating attitude settling more ominouslyover the youth 's spirit each day . He deemed it prudent , though , not to invade his mental tusslings . " Time is the healer of such matters , " he mused . " He must work it out for himself . " By this time they had traveled east far enough to arrive among the Cherokees . Again , the disciple of tribal union preached diligently to the curious throngs . The evenings Metamoris spent to himself . Both on the trail and in the towns he drifted out away from the presence of others . On the first night after their arrival in a small Cherokee village , only two of the three visitors from the north appeared at the fireside circle . " Where 's Metamoris ? " Jim asked Tecumseh as they seated themselves in the place of honor for visiting dignitaries . " I do n't know , but , I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look on the banks of that beautiful lake we passed just out of town as we came in . " " He surely is acting strange these days , is n't he ? " Jim asked , casting a quizzical glance at his fellow Shawnee . Neither had occasion to seek their friend that night , for they soon became engrossed in the activities of the fireside . Across the soft summer breeze  --  whispering through the trees . It was an exquisite June night  --  the kind that follows charming , glad-to-be-alive June days spoken of by the poet as " rare "  --  when heaven permits earth to compete with its own sublimity . Well , heaven tried earth that matchlessday and night of June 7 , 1808 , and found her not wanting  --  for much  --  in competition with the spirit realms.  |p312Gentle  breezes , blue skies , fleecy white clouds , melancholy wild flowers , nature 's aromas of field and woods , singing birds , droning bees , exquisite butterflies , babbling brooks , a sea of vivid greenness everywhere , sun and moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artistic soul of the great Creator , the Universal Artist who paints here in June a picture rare of beauty and background for living that to Him is commonplace . The traditional leadening spring fever had settled over the conscious motivations of the red children of creation scattered patternlessly across the great American plains from the Appalachians to the Rockies . Of course , this seasonal lethargy was no stranger to the white settlers in the eastern part of this great wilderness , but they really were too enterprising , ambitious , homesteading-minded , and society-building to let go and really enjoy the inherent pleasures of a good old-fashioned case of aboriginal spring fever . The Caucasian brand was bad enough , consideringhow they must be slaving laboriously in the plowed fields , grubbing stumps with painstaking effort out of the root-filled soil , back-aching over the family washtub , or engaged in some other equally tiring pioneer drudgery . But on farther west in the Indian country , from Greenvilleto the Pacific , life , for the most part , was less strenuousand nature indulged in freely  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls of nature 's children . War was imminently expected  --  tomorrow , perhaps  --  but not today on this day in June . As the brilliant , promise-filled sunset beamed forth in all of its inspiring magnificence and then faded gloriously into the land of numberless yesterdays , the summer night , shrouded in its usual mystery and cricket-chirping nostalgia , accompanied by its ever-present croaking frog concerto , crept cautiously and , like Nianque , the cougar , stalks his prey , noiselessly across the continent . A soft , musicallytonedbreeze rippled gently through the tree-filled forest . It was a beautiful sound . The leaves did n't jump and dance and leap as when the strong west wind blows violentlyacross the land , snapping off limbs wherever he finds a loosened one or catches one off guard or in a wrong twist . Instead , the leaves barely stirred in a slight waving motion similar to the ripples on the waters of a smallp313pond when Peama , the swan , comes gliding serenely along . The south wind is more of a compromiser and a charmer than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west wind . An advocate of tranquility , he soothes the souls of men by his rustling in the trees and his gentle breezes on their fevered brows . He is not an aggressive , ambitious fellow like his more zealous kin of the west , who strives to accomplish tremendous feats like blowing sailboats around the great waters , challenging the right of the earthly bird to invade his domain , and moving great cloud banks out of the land of the setting sun  --  which is the home of the mighty west wind . Instead , the south wind believes in living and letting live , and rarely is he stirred to violent or punitive action ! Thus , that night over mid-America the peaceful south wind was affected by the same spring fever that was settlingso decidedly over his friends , the red-skinned earth people . He sounded like the guarded whispers of a lover imparting the age-old secrets of love 's young dreams into the receptive ear of his maiden . If you listened closely , attentively , you could imagine the meaning of the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeze and through the trees might be qualified further in these words : More like a sighFrom the stars on high .. . There was something melancholy and sad , yet pleasant and easing in the soft music being carried along on the mild southern wind . The stars above were brilliant in their dazzling , elusive whiteness . Since they could n't all hide at the same time , millions of pinpoints of flickering translucencecrowned the horizon-framed dome of the night sky  --  infinity 's humble preview to earth beings of its heavenly hunting grounds , its eternal hereafter , on high . Any ethereal or spiritual action that might be on the prowl that lovely June night must of necessity maintain some significant relationship to the dominating stars above and the eerie light of the summer moon . Any thought impression that might be transmitted through space that night any true dreamer or lover of the fanciful would have asso/ciated with the mystery of the gleaming stars and mellow moon glow . There was such a thought transmission along the night wind as it glided effortlessly over the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply there wasWafted a song of love . In the old days many believed in the projection of thoughts from mind to mind without actual physical contactbetween individuals . This was true alike among people with red skins and dark skins and white skins . Dreams , it was believed , were means of receiving telepathic messages , experiencing prophetic visions , accurately determiningcurrent happenings elsewhere in the world , and providing a guide to action in the future by affording an insightinto unborn days and nights ahead . The old ones believed implicitly that spirits often were at work in the world and frequently made their presence and influence felt in the affairs of men , effecting their strange , mysterious purposes for shaping destinies and making the right and the good to triumph , although , assuredly , there were evil spirits at work as well ! No one knew when or where a dream , vision , trance , or other spiritual phenomenon might occur , or what momentous significance it might have in the world . Some called it " superstition , " others called it " spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Wind gave .. . The nebulous nature of the night 's unusual activities began to take on a more tangible , realistic aspect as an actual being enters the picture to become a primary link in this strange chain of night-wind communication . A youthful redskin brave stood motionless on the banks of a beautiful lake . From his concealed position beneath the huge trees lining the shore , he gazed sadly , dreamily out across the silvery , shifting waters . His was a dejected , lonesome figure there in the shadows of that lovely moon and water setting . A heartsick , longing Metamoris looked out across the haunting scene , and listened to the sympatheticmurmur of the understanding south wind !  |p315Could  the friendly spirit of the south wind know of the forlornness , the emptiness of heart that had grown within him constantly since that night so many moons ago when , in a cruel , heartless way , he had fled in the dark of night from the one glowing sentiment in his life ? His remorsefulreflections gradually turned to idle , pleasant dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wynoma , Wynoma "  --  the words kept ringing through his disturbed thoughts . The cooling breath of the south wind was upon his face , as if some good friend placed a comforting hand on his fevered brow . The gentle breeze seemed to whisper words of solace and understanding , saying : " I will help you , brother ! Bare your soul to me . Unburdenyour locked-up emotions . Speak from the depth of your heart . Say what your soul would have the maiden hear . Impart your message to me . Trust your friend , the south wind , brother , for he is strong where you are weak ; he sees where your eyes can not penetrate ; he travels swiftly through the air like his cousin , Tianke , the lightning , while you walk the earth in all of its hardships and limitations . I am of the spirit world  --  so can not be seen . You are a child of earth  --  thus always visible . But I am your friend ! You need me and I can help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doubt that your message will be delivered . Do not fear that it will be perverted . Do not wonder if your friend will respect your confidence  --  he will do that . Only you and the maiden and the south wind will know the contents of the message . Speak , brother , the night grows old and the stars and the moon must fade from the sky ere long . The maiden also gazes upwardat this moment . She thinks of you and seeks an understanding of your heart ! She is receptive to the spiritualcommunion with her long-absent lover , which I , Sauwanachen , the South Wind , can bring about . Pour out the longing of your soul as if the maiden were here besideyou . I await your message , brother , and so does the maiden ! " Metamoris listened intently to the whispered urgings of the south wind . He grasped their meaning hazily . Suddenlyhe felt a strong sensation of closeness to Wynoma-a sort of blending of his spirit with hers ! The old feel/ing of urgent love and purposeful devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many , many suns welled up within him . It was enhanced and magnified by the moons and seasons of regret and longing . He spoke lowly and with deep animation , calling her name  --  once , twice  --  over and over again . With increasing vividness he felt her presence near ! In his enchanted vision he imagined he saw her lovely form out across the magic waters , seated gracefully beneath the great trees along the Wapihani . That vision faded and it seemed she was standing beside him and he felt her presence very near ! Thus he imparted to the south wind . A message to deliver far , far away to a dusky maid . As he finished his soul-bared expression , he heard a sort of increased rustling among the leaves above , a stepped-up tempo of the gentle breeze in the treetops . Then , it graduallyfaded away  --  from the woods out over the lake . Before it disappeared , Metamoris fancied he heard the consoling distant voice of the south wind say : " Fear not , brother , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieve ! She will hear your voice ! She will know your heart ! More than that , I , Sauwanachen , can not do ! " Strange how relieved and unburdened Metamoris suddenlyfelt ! Now the South Wind flew to a spot where he knewA maiden waited longingly beneath the moon . If simple creatures like the humble swallow and the drab little wren can fly unerringly across the miles , neverp317making a mistake in judgment  --  then how much easier for the spirit element of the south wind to span the reaches from a youthful , heartsick warrior far from home to a distant spot where a dusky maiden sat alone on a wooded knoll overlooking a beautiful moonlit river ! Never did he falter ; neither did he hesitate . Straight did he fly ! When he dipped earthward from the star-filled night sky it was to settle gently around the still figure of the maiden . Just as lonesome , just as melancholy and just as filled with longing did he find the maiden as he had , at first , discoveredher faraway , pining lover ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmurof the night wind among the leaves above her head . For she was deeply engrossed in a nocturnal reverie . As the night hours wore on she seemed to be impervious to the radiant beauty of the blissful combination of stars , moon , and Wapihani . She asked herself for the hundredth time , " Why did he go ? " Then , as so often in past moons , she answered her own question and in the same way she had often done before . " He never really wanted to marry until the war clouds have passed . " As always , the old perplexing , distressing questions for which there was no attainable answer , arose , raising doubts and fears ! " Why , " she asked in anguish , " did he agree to the marriage ? Why did he wait till the last moment to leave ? Why did he not have the courage to tell me he had changed his mind ? Why has he not returned  --  to visit , at least ? Why ? " Then came the most haunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves  --  or never loved at all ? Yet , he told me he loved me and I do not believe  --  I can not believe  --  he would speak falsely of that ! If he would only return and say I love you , Wynoma , ' just as he did before  --  nothing else would matter ! I would not make the same mistake again . If he would only send a message that he still cares and wishes me to wait for him  --  that he will come again in the spring or fall  --  but  --  nothing ! Yet , how can I doubt his love ! I can not ! I shall wait for him however long it may be ! I only ask the Great Spirit that he guide his step and keep him safe from harm and one day direct his path back to me ! "  |p318Locked  in her intense meditation she still failed to note the musical tones of the softly singing wind around her . It was only when she heard a faraway voice whisper her name that she heeded Sauwanachen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely audible , that she could n't be sure that she had really heard anything at all . Surely , she imagined it ! It must have been the sweet , melodious sound of the soft breeze as it stirred the leaves . Then she heard it again , more distinctly . It dawned upon her that the voice had called her name several times before , but she had not distinguished it from the soothing sound of the wind . " That voice  --  no , it could n't be  --  but it did sound like his voice ! " Every fiber of her being strained to listen ! She trembled ever so slightly as she sat there in a spell . South Wind knew that at last he had captured her attention . He delivered then the precious message entrusted to him . The sound of the voice was just as tender and deep-meaning as when so passionately uttered . The consoling , but mysterious tones , accompanied by the nostalgic music of the wind , sounded , to the maiden , like a beautiful song  --  sung by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dusky maid : Wynoma , Wynoma ! Clearly calls my soul when we 're apart . Wynoma , Wynoma ! Ca n't you hear its message in your heart ? The Great Manitou created you , my maiden . You 're the fairest flower among the Lenape , Wynoma , Wynoma ! Many moons , too soon , have passed away , Wynoma , Wynoma ! Wait for me , I 'll come to you one day . Wynoma sat , enthralled  --  not frightened , not dumb struck , not overcome  --  simply enthralled ! Her lips moved in a plaintive whisper : " Metamoris , my precious one , my dear heart , where are you , my love ? " The voice returned then as the breeze picked up a slight momentum among the leaves . It was louder and clearer and more recognizable than before : Wynoma , tell me maiden , are you ever true ? Wynoma , life would lose its meaning without you !  |p320Softly  the tones faded away . A few seconds of silence followed the last words of the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ! I am true ! " she whispered . Again , she waited , not daring to hope , but hoping just the same to hear the voice . Faintly and from far away she heard it , so faintly it seemed almost like an echo . Wynoma , Wynoma ! Hear me , O Wynoma , I love you ! Wynoma sat like a statue for a long while after the voice on the night breeze had faded away . She scarcely breathed , lest she miss the voice if it should faintly call again . When she was convinced that it would not return , thoughts came racing in a wild jumble into her confused mind . Throughout all of them , however , was a deep joy of exultation ! She had heard his voice and he loved her as always ! Oh , she was the happiest maiden on the Wapihani  --  yes , in all the great , huge world ! " He shall yet be mine ! " she told herself jubilantly . The moment of triumph was quickly followed by quiet contemplation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheming self , lost in the gloomy sadness of the moons past , forcefully reasserted itself ! Already an idea was dawning on her rejuvenated senses . For a while she threshed this new thought around . Arising quickly , she returned to her bed . Unnoticed was the beauty of the June night , but gone was the pining and wasting away in loneliness ! Rather , she had formulated a course of action in keeping with her old spirit . All was now concentrated on putting the plan into action . Accordingly , she retired for her first night of untortured sleep in many moons . Bright and early next morning , Wynoma was up , seekingout her father whom she found busy sharpening hisp321knives and hatchets . As she stooped down beside him she placed her arm around his broad shoulder and spoke : " Father , I have made a decision . Do not try to dissuade me , for it will not be so ! I go immediately to Metamoris ' town to await his return home in the fall ! " Lapinabit glanced sharply at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassive features . " Surely , my daughter , you would not consider doing a thing so unmaidenlike ! You are a princess among your people  --  not a prideless slave ! Speak not madly , my child ! " " Oh , but I would do it , Father  --  and I 'm going to do it ! I want you to take me there . I shall remain with White Beaver and Sunflower until he returns . " " But I tell you that 's mad , daughter ! He will disdain you ! " " Oh , no he wo n't , Father , " she replied stubbornly . " I heard his voice last night and he still loves me  --  he said so  --  and , oh , he said much more than that ! " Lapinabit laid down his knife and sharpening stone and turned to face the bright eyes he loved , so long now withouttheir customary luster . He marveled to see the old fire burning again . Whatever experience she had had , fate had played a cruel trick on his beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damnable work . When the next crushing disillusionment came  --  who could know the result ? Perhaps even the sickness spirits would follow close after a new heartbreak and take out of the land of the living this glowing light of his life . He placed his rough hand tenderly on her braided hair , stroking gently as he spoke with soothing words . " Hush , now , my little one . You were dreaming . " " I was not sleeping , Father , and I am not mad . It happened  --  outby the river in the late night . " " Then it was nothing more than the sighing of the wind through the trees . I have heard its melancholy music often . " " Yes , my father , you are right ! It was the sighing of the wind , but it was his voice , too ! He called to me and told me , oh , such wonderful things ! His voice was carried on the wind ! Do not fear , Father , he will be pleased to see me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . Will you accompany me ? "  | " Wynoma , child , please listen to me ! This is folly ! If this were all true he would return to you here ! Wait for him here , child ! A maiden must not pursue the warrior  --  it 's just not the thing to do  --  for any self-respecting maiden , let alone the daughter of a chief ! " " I 'm truly sorry if I cause you shame , Father . But I will make my own decision . Remember what you told Tamaqua ? You said I was capable of making by own decisions ! " " I also told him you were an obedient daughter ! Do n't make me change my opinion on that ! " " My decision is made , Father , and can not be changed ! " " Have you talked to your mother about this ? " he asked in unbelieving dismay . " No , but there is no need . I go to Metamoris ! If you do not take me , I shall go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wynoma , not that ! I will take you if you are determined to go ! Surely we will wait until one of the late summer moons ! " " We will start before the sun sets today , my beloved father ! " As she said it she encircled his neck with her slender arms , prompting a surprised " ugh " from the dismayedchieftain . " I am very happy now , Father ! I shall feel much closer to him in his own town ! " As she spoke she leaped away with the agility of a young deer . " Come , let us tell Mother of our trip . " She bounded across the open area toward the main lodge . Shaking his head in bewilderment , Lapinabit lumbered after the sprightly figure skipping merrily across the open space . " It has always been you who have controlled me , instead of the father commanding the daughter , " he grumbled . " If one of my braves permitted his daughter to so lead him by the nose , I would strip him of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule his own household ! " " Now , Father , quit your growling ! You sound like a croaking old frog  --  or a grumbling bear , " she called back laughingly over her shoulder . " You should seek my counsel more often . Who knows , you might be head chief over all the Wapihani towns if you did ! "  |p323Yanenowi  displayed one helpless look of amazement , but not a word did she utter . She knew better than her husband when to go along with this astonishing daughter of theirs . She set about packing food and blankets for the journey . Before noon they were ready to depart . Aside from calling the Bee Handler to him to instruct that subchiefto take charge of the town in his absence , Lapinabit made no other announcement of his trip . The less attentioncentered upon this wild-goose chase the better ! Not even the family was down at the river to watch them shove off in their light canoe . Several days later , Lapinabit 's frail craft glided effortlesslyinto a landing at Metamoristown on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her side . The greeting by the townsfolk was overwhelmingly enthusiastic , for she was much in favor there . Sunflower was beside herself with joy ! The old squaw 's understandingand sympathetic ear listened in horrified eagerness as Wynoma unfolded the entire story of her blighted love ! In the privacy of Sunflower 's lodge and in the comforting embrace of the fat one 's strong arms she found the solace she needed to unlock the torrents of bitter tears so long locked in her heart . The disastrous end of the wedding , which she had heard rumors of , dismayed Sunflower every bit as much as it did Wynoma , for she wept as enthusiasticallyas did the maiden ! Between sobs , the story was told . Wept out , finally , Sunflower spoke her piece with many determined nods of her head : " You have done well , my child , no matter what your father thinks ! Men never understand a woman 's heart , anyway ! I know you have made the right decision for I know Metamoris ! It will happen just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to you on the south wind ! He carried the message Metamoris holds in his heart ! After he returns you will learn that he was thinking of you at the very time he spoke to you ! Never fear . You will see , you will see ! " " Oh , Sunflower , you are such a comfort ! " The girl threw her arms about the plump one 's neck and squeezedp324vigorously . Caught off guard by the maiden 's unexpected burst of affectionate gratitude , Sunflower , like on a previousoccasion , collapsed upon the floor of the hut ! This time Wynoma accompanied her . They landed in a most undignified heap of swirling skirts ! There they sat , together on the dirt floor , first laughing , then crying with the deepest of mutual feeling . Standing in the doorway , White Beaver , who had just lifted the skin flap to enter , scratched his head in amazement at the scene . Finally he blurted out : " What in the name of the good Manitou is the matter with you two females ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will call the medicine man ! " " No , no , my good old husband , we are not crazy , " Sunfloweranswered , as she suddenly switched from crying to laughing . " We are just happy  --  are n't we , Wynoma ? " " Yes , Sunflower , " the girl responded , joining her giddy merriment . " We are most happy ! " " Yes , that 's what I 'm afraid of , " White Beaver added suspiciously . " Too happy , if you ask me ! " Changing her mood abruptly to a more serious vein , Wynoma said : " We are very sad , too , White Beaver . Are n't we sad , Sunflower ? " " Oh , yes , yes , child  --  we are most sad ! " Whereupon they began to wail and weep lustily in forthright sorrow for the cruel treatment Wynoma had experienced at the hands of the young chief . White Beaver had seen enough ! He beat a hasty retreatfrom the hut , muttering to himself as he emerged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , White Beaver , need the medicine man . " Women were an enigma White Beaver had never fathomed . He knew at this moment he never would ! " NORTH ! " Metamoris completed the southern trip with a peacep326of mind he had not known for a long , long time . The glow that illuminated his heart outshone both the brilliance of the daylight sun and the radiance of a summer moon . His companions were astonished at the change ! Quickly masteringenough of the Creek and Choctaw dialects , he was able to join Tecumseh in conferring persuasively with the southern chiefs in behalf of the confederation . It was not that he was less preoccupied than before  --  to the contrary , Tecumseh noted , he was even more so . His mind was frequently far , far away and Tecumseh suspected where ! " What has changed you , my young friend ? " he asked good-naturedly . " Why , nothing at all , Father . Why do you ask ? " " No reason , I suppose . " The older man sighed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing ! The Great Master of Life knows more about the spirits that inhabit these bodies of ours than we ourselves know ! Women were created by him for a purpose . If he did n't have me in mind when he made young and beautiful maidens , he surely was thinking of you ! " The coming of the moon of fallen leaves prompted Tecumsehto give the order Metamoris had been awaiting anxiously  --  " North ! " The return trip was slow and tedious , or so it seemed to Metamoris . Mornings invariably found him the first up , preparing food and ready to resumethe homeward journey . Finally they arrived at the Ohio , considerably east of their crossing place on the trip south . " Are you going to stop at your own town or go straight north to Wapihani , " Tecumseh asked in a quiet , significantlyunassuming voice . Metamoris shot a piercing , questioninglook at Tecumseh . " Wapinepay , " he replied curtly , and with a finality that ended that line of conversation abruptly . Tecumseh , as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wapihani for sure  --  but he was making no advance announcementto anyone about it ! Once across the Ohio , they parted company . Tecumseh and Young Jim veered west and north for the new Shawnee town on the Tippecanoe , while Metamoris struck out due north to Wapinepay . Metamoristown was , after all , notp327far off the main route to the Sarah Town . He owed it to Grandmother and the village folk to stop there first . As he approached the familiar valley of his childhood , Metamoris discovered the fresh tracks of a deer crossing the trail toward a small stream familiar to Indian and animal inhabitants of the valley alike as Salt Creek because of a popular salt lick near its mouth on the Wapinepay . He hesitated momentarily , debating whether to track the deer or proceed on to the town . Reflecting on the frequent scarcity of game in the valley and the feast it would provide for his homecoming , he determined to make a quick try for the animal . Accordingly , he took up the trail , employing his crafty skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large buck . As on a more unhappy occasion , he braced himself solidly , laboriously shouldered the buck , and , bent far over toward the ground , set off toward the village . Crossing the Wapinepay at a familiar riffle , he approached the town more by instinct than by sight . At first he was not recognized because of his bent form beneath the weight of the animal . The deer , however , aroused attention on all sides . " Meat ! " someone shouted . " Food ! " yelled another . " We eat ! " " Feast ! Feast ! " shouted the lusty voices of children as they swarmed around the figure of the successful hunter . One inquisitive youngster bothered to lean over and look up into the face of the one who labored under the weight of the buck . " Metamoris ! Metamoris , METAMORIS ! " he shouted , and the populace took up the cry . The exuberance at the prospect of a feast was puny , indeed , compared to the excited furor sweeping the town with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire before the hut of Whitep328Beaver , heard , as in a dream , the joyful , yet dreaded words she had lived for with mounting impatience for days ! " He is here , " she informed herself in a whisper , swayingas she began to feel weak all over . Nevertheless , steelingherself according to a solemn self-promise , she stood straight and unbending , her eyes closed tightly . She could n't know whether the Great Spirit would have time to hear , much less answer , the humble petition of a frightened maiden . But she called on him notwithstanding ! " Give me strength to face him . Give me courage to smile when he looks at me ! " Then she turned and ran swiftly to meet the dancing mass of young humanity surrounding the hunter as he plodded slowly up the village street past White Beaver 's home in the direction of his own lodge . By now the whole population was out in the open to greet their returning chief . Halting as she reached the throng of gleeful children seeking eagerly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she hesitated momentarily , telling herself that which she needed no convincing to believe : " What a brave and handsome figure he is  --  this strong , sure-footed man of mine ! " The thrill of being so close to him seemed for a moment to be more than her poor , tortured heart could endure . As the taggers along caught sight of her slight form gazing so intently at the burdened chief , they instinctively fell back , in recognition of the very special relationship betweenher and their friend . No one doubted the reason for her presence in the village . They acceded to her prior right to greet the returning warrior . The din died down quickly as Wynoma raised her hand for silence . " My chief may drop the buck here at my tepee . " Her voice had the old provocative , enticing ring of confident mystery ! Metamoris took one , then another step before the familiar voice registered in his brain . He hesitated  --  still bent over  --  the buck wavering shakily in the air ! Then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voice  --  that voice . Slowly , he began to rise up , then instantly he stood straight as an arrow , looking incredulously , unbelievinglyat the smiling-faced maiden on the other side of the buck . It would have been a safe wager at that mo/ment that he would end up on top of the buck ! But he did n't . Their eyes bored into each other , hungrily , crazily ! Wynoma smiled radiantly , even as she had prayed she would . Her chief stared  --  as if he viewed a figure from the spirit world  --  but the most lovely , exciting spirit Metamorisever hoped to see . " Wynoma ! " he finally managed to whisper . The maiden , as lost for words as her wayward lover , answered only , " Metamoris ! " Nothing more . The next instant he cleared the buck in one swift leap and , almost faster than the eyes of the village folk could follow , enfolded the slight form of the maiden in his arms . The embrace grew more impassioned with each succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The spellbound watchers gathered quietly around the clinginglovers , who were oblivious of all else in the world but each other ! Slowly the crowd began to move around the pair , chanting an old Lenape love song . It was the traditional , age-old dance of the marriage vows of true lovers ! There were few dry eyes around the moving ring of singers . Their chief 's midnight escapade  --  leaving the maiden on the night before their marriage  --  was forgotten , the villagedismay wiped away in a burst of genuine elation ! The wrong was righted and the devoted lovers reunited . Metamoris , reluctantly , pushed the maiden away from the close embrace , holding her at arm 's length before him . " Wynoma , can you ever forgive me ? " " There 's nothing to forgive , my chief . You were right . I was wrong . It is I who should ask your forgiveness ! " " That 's not true , my princess . But it is past now . Wynoma , will you marry me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I am ready now . " " But what about your work with Tecumseh ? " " I was foolish ! I know that now . It will interfere no longer . I need you , Wynoma , every sun of my life  --  whether we are together or apart . I want you now , Wynoma ! " " I 'm yours , my chief , and always have been since the first time I saw you here at the council fire . " Then , with that mischievous twinkle in her brown eyes , she added : " Here am I and there 's your tepee over there ! I am readyp330for you this moment or I can wait -- no matter how long the time ! " " The waiting is over , Wynoma ! " Then he turned to the townspeople gathered around on all sides , holding his prized possession tightly in the strong grip of his right arm , and spoke in a loud voice : " Hear me , my people . I am this day taking a wife . You are witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daughter of Lapinabit of the Turtle Clan , as my wife . Tomorrowthere will be a feast and the traditional ceremonies . But , by authority that is mine as a warrior and chief of the Lenni-Lenape , I now claim her as my own and proclaimher my wife ! Henceforth , let all know that she is my wife and I am her husband ! " Gathering her up into his arms in one fast swoop he walked straight for his own lodge . The crowd fell back before them . As they reached the tent someone raised the flap . That someone was a widely beaming Sunflower . Just inside the lodge stood the slight , dried-up figure of Grandmother , equally overjoyed , but somewhat less effervescentthan the portly Sunflower . The stalwart young chief , with the maiden tenderly enfolded in his arms , leaned forward and carried his prize into his home . Then the flap was lowered . This was not a new experience for Metamoris ! It was for Wynoma ! It was thrilling and sacred to them both , being for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love and inevitablelonging heartbreak ! Wynoma was the wife of Metamoris ! The winter of 1808-9 was the happiest period in the lives of Metamoris and Wynoma . They had each other and they were together and love was a glorious experience ! Late in the fall they journeyed north to the Sarah Town to convey the glad news of their marriage to Lapinabitp331and his flock . Standturk accompanied them . The first night upstream found them at John Conner 's new trading post on the upper Wapinepay at the point where the Wapihani trail veered northwest from the river 's due-north course . " Welcome , welcome , my Lenape brothers , " Conner greetedthem enthusiastically . " Am I seeing things or are you leading a wife in your path , Chief ? " Conner addressed his fluent Delaware to Metamoris . " You see right , John Conner . This is Wynoma , my wife , daughter of the renowned Wapihani chieftain , Lapinabit . She is the firstborn of her father 's household and of my heart ! " " Gallantly spoken , my son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such an honored chief ! " Changingto English , he added , gazing intently at Wynoma : " She 's a purty one , too , ai n't she ? " His eyes sparkled as he said it . " Like the blue summer sky , spring flowers , golden leaves of fall , and bright winter stars all combined ! " Metamoris replied graciously . As he spoke he looked down fondly at his bride . Wynoma blushed to hear herself spoken of in such glowing terms . " Oh , oh , danged if there ai n't that poet comin ' out in you again . This is the maiden you described in such glowingterms on the hike north to Greenville  --  daughter of Big Bear ! When were you two married ? " He addressed his question to Wynoma with an encouraging smile , revertingback to Lenape . " Over a moon has passed , " she replied with smiling eyes and displaying beautiful white teeth . " You know , I think I have a couple things will interest you , young lady . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " Without waiting for answer , he continued in the same breath , " Come with me , both of you . " Wheeling around , he led them into the trading post where he proceeded to present Wynoma with certain cookingutensils as wedding gifts . " Look at this iron pot , is n't it a dandy ? Here 's a skillet  --  finest kind of a cooking pan you can get hold of . Here 's a stirring spoon . I want you to have it , too ! " The newlyweds thanked Conner profusely for the gifts ,  |p332their  exuberance showing plainly their genuine appreciationfor these valuable possessions  --  valuable in either white or redskin homes of the wilderness . " Now for a surprise I have a mind you 'll be interested in after you know what it 's all about . Wait here a minute . I 'll be back in a jiffy . " Five minutes later Conner reentered the trading post in company of another white man , a tall , rawboned fellow clad in a homespun black suit and black hat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This here 's Brother Thomas Guerin , a rovin ' Baptist preacher , who is staying here for a few days , " he announced enthusiastically in English . " I thought , seeing as how you young folks are just married , you might as well wrap it up two ways and do a good strong job tying the knot while you 're at it . He can marry you according to the laws of the United States government . " and the precepts of the Church of Jesus Christ upon the earth  --  do n't forget the most important part of it , John Conner , " the lean and willowy backwoods preacher added . " Glad to meet ya young newlyweds ! " At the mention of the name of the white man 's deity , Metamoris ' mind flashed back to Lukenback and the insightinto the religion of Christ with which the Moravian had provided Tecumseh and him . The idea , therefore , of a Christian confirmation of his marriage struck him as being good , although the prospects of marriage under the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently to Wynoma what the two men had said , supplementing her own meager knowledge of the white man 's language . " My husband 's will is my own , " she said submissively , looking up into his face with a smile of contented trust . Metamoris turned to the white man and replied in Lenape , Conner interpreting . " Since I feel no allegiance to the white man 's government , I feel no need to be married according to its laws . I prefer much the time-honored customs and laws of my people ! But as to the ceremony of the white man 's religion , it is another matter . I believe in Jesus Christ and would be glad to have His approval of my marriage ! " " He 's an intelligent Injun , " the backwoods man of Godp333observed , " most remarkable for a savage ! Has he ever been baptized ? " Metamoris answered for himself in English : " No . " " Do you believe in Christ , young feller ? " " Yes , " Metamoris replied firmly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's good enough fer me , by cracky , " the preaching man declared , slapping his leg as an indication of his satisfactionwith the young Indian 's response to the vital question of belief in the divinity of the Master . " It is most heartenin ' , Conner , to find one of these children of the wilderness  --  way out here far from civilization  --  who believesand makes the good confession and knows what he is doing when he does it ! And I believe this feller does . I will baptize them as well as marry them ! " Before Conner could answer with another glowing tribute to Metamoris ' astuteness , the young chief himself spoke up in reply to the preacher 's expression in regard to Christian baptism . " No baptize  --  just marry ! " The homespun preacher looked sharply at the young man before him , then at Conner . Finally , he said in a resigned , disappointed voice : " All right , friend , but I remind ya that ya must be buried with yer Lord in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he opened his worn Bible , thumbed through it briefly , allowing its open pages to rest in the huge palm of his left hand . " What is your name ? " he asked the young man . " Metamoris . " " What is your name ? " he asked , turning to Wynoma . She understood enough English to reply forthwith , " Wynoma . " " What tribe are you from ? " " Lenni-Lenape , " Metamoris replied distinctly and proudly . " That is Delaware , is it not ? " " Yes . " " Her , too ? " " Yes . " " Metamoris , brave of the Delaware nation " Pardon me , Reverend , " spoke up Conner , " but Metamorisis a chief ! "  | " Thank you , friend Conner . " Then , after clearing his throat in slight embarrassment , he marshalled his ministerialdignity and began again : " Metamoris , chief of the Delaware nation , do ya take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " Do ya promise to love , honor , pertect , and cherish her till death do ya part ? " " I do . " " Wynoma , woman of the Delaware nation " " Pardon me , Reverend , but this girl is an Indian princess , the daughter of the great Delaware chief , Lapinabit . " " Ah , yes , Brother Conner . " This time he cleared his throat louder than before . " Now , ah , Wynoma , daughter of the great Chief Lapinabit , princess of the Delaware nation , do ya take this man to be yer lawful wedded husband ? " " I do , " she responded , Metamoris coaching her how to say it . " Do ya promise to love , honor , cherish , and obey him till death do ya part ? " " I do . " " Then place yer hands together . I now pernounce ya man and wife . Whut God has jined together let no man put asunder ! Ye kin kiss the bride now , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him perplexed , the preacher added hastily , " Oh , I know ya been married to her fer a few days . But , shucks , ' tai n't goin ' ta hurt ya none to kiss her agin ! " By this time Conner stepped up by Metamoris and said , " That 's a custom at white people 's wedding ceremonies for the husband to kiss his wife at the end of the wedding . I know your people ai n't used to showing affection in publicthat way , but since this is a white ceremony and you 've already had your own , why do n't ya do it anyway ? " As he suggested it he laughed good-naturedly and slapped the young chief on the back . Metamoris hesitated a moment , then laughed himself . He turned , swooped the slight figure of his beloved spouse into his arms , and planted a solid ,  |p336And  so the simple Christian ceremony was added to the Lenape time-honored rites , including a public proclamation , the singing of the ancient tribal marriage song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed  --  though the Christian ceremony was a rather melodramaticgesture to them . Still they enjoyed it and were pleased that it was performed ! The backwoods preacher scribbled out the date , facts of the ceremony , and names of those joined together in holy matrimony on a faded , creased certificate he carried for that purpose . After havingthem sign by means of their X , he signed as the duly authorized marrying official and Conner signed as a witness . The young couple prized their certificate of Christian marriage very highly and looked long and admiringly at it . Afterwards , Wynoma put it away among her prized possessions , which included the charm piece of Metamoris ' mother and the ankle band given to him by Tecumseh . The Sarah Town , one day , was shocked , then grumbling and dubious , finally reconciled and jubilant when their belovedprincess returned with the handsome young chieftain of Wapinepay at her side as her husband . No doubt about it this time ! The whole town was thrown into an uproar . Lapinabit was beside himself with joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , bouncing back off the trees and echoing up and down the river above the din of the growing melee ! " Ho , my people , " he shouted triumphantly , " we have much cause for celebration ! I have gained a son and our village has gained a new chief . Wynoma is the wife of Metamoris ! This calls for a feast to honor the marriage . Let our women prepare much food ! Let our young men go to the forests to procure meat . Let us all make merry , for this is truly an occasion for rejoicing ! " All was forgotten and forgiven ! Metamoris was backp337in favor with the village folk . Everyone was gay and lighthearted . Messengers were dispatched to neighboring towns to invite any and all of the tribesmen to come and join in the celebration . Even William Conner and Mekinges , with their six half-breed children , showed up and joined wholeheartedly in the festivities . Mekinges ' father , the venerated Chief Anderson , came down river with a large delegation from his town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were featured in the varied entertainmentand activities . Lapinabit was so exuberant that his normal fatherly pride , combined with the usual imbibing excesses of such a celebration , caused him to speak in glowing tones of the exceptional beauty of his daughter and the great reputationof his son-in-law as a warrior and chieftain ! Anderson , in good-natured humor and , likewise , convivially tipsy , addressed his neighbor on his partiality . " I trust my old friend has strong and tough sinews in his shirt  --  else his chest may swell out so far it will burst them ! " Lapinabit laughed heartily as he replied , " You ought to know , friend Koktowhanund . I remember how proud you were when your daughter married the handsome young fur trader . " He hesitated to refer to William Conner too pointedly as a white man , not being quite that intoxicated ! " I was , it is true . " Sobering remarkably , Anderson added , " Those were happier days when a white skin did not bring the resentment among the tribesmen it now does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chief . He is more Lenape than white ! Besides , where would the Lenni-Lenape be if it were not for their adopted sons , the Conner brothers ? " Lapinabit offered a generous gesture of friendship on this occasion of his own great happiness . He felt he could afford to be a bit more than charitable . " I wonder about that , " Anderson replied , his brow creasingin a contemplative frown . " The Conners were raised as Lenni-Lenape , it is true ! But blood is strong and there are signs of late that they may be drifting toward the people of their birth , away from their adoption . It has been said by our wise minds of the past that the blood will prevail when it is put to the test ! " " William and John Conner may not always stay withp338the Lenape , " Lapinabit reflected . " After all , their lives now are the lives of the white trader , not the Indian . But they will not betray those who nurtured them to manhood and have given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow chief , then replied , " Does my brother speak with the reason of his mind or the hope of his heart ? " Lapinabit did not hesitate in his answer , " Does the drowning man select the branch he grabs for ? Does the deer halt to see from whence came the arrow that rips his flesh ? " " I perceive , " Anderson responded sadly , " that we are in accord in our views of the Conners . I do not think they will stick the knife in our backs , but they will not stand between us and the danger when it comes . Buckongehelishas long been gone . He will not return with a white skin ! The Conners will return to the ways of the whites when we are overrun ! What they will do if a general war should flame forth , I dare not consider too strongly . " The stalwart chiefs walked proudly around the town together , observing and joining in the celebration and merrymaking . They laughed frequently , regaining at least a portion of their earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lapinabit said good-naturedly , " to continue my boasting . Yonder is the fair and beauteousform of the one I have given in marriage . When youth and beauty are placed in the same form , it is always pleasant to look upon  --  even at our advanced age , eh ? " " I still believe my brother is prejudiced in favor of his own , " Anderson replied with a hearty chuckle . " But I 'll have to admit , your boasting is well justified ! It would be difficult to overlook the charms of the young woman  --  even , as you say , at our advanced ages . " " My newly-acquired son-in-law , too , is a source of pride ! " " True , true . Metamoris is a great young leader of ourpeople . He looks it , too . He is tall , strong , and manly . They are a most seemly appearing couple together  --  thosetwo . Small wonder you are proud . I rejoice with you becausethe Great Spirit has so smiled upon your household ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The participants ate , slept and played as they wereinclined and a spirit of joyful living reigned everywhere.  |p339It  was as if the proud Delawares were having one last fling before drifting on into oblivion  --  a last tribute to haunting memories of precious yesterdays when the sons and daughters of the Lenni-Lenape were content in their native forests  --  a legend that was broken , an ideal of the past that would not return . Metamoris and Wynoma were supremely happy . They laughed and romped and joked and visited with friends during the celebration in honor of their marriage . The first day back in town they slipped out to Wynoma 's dreamingpool in the secluded glen . That night they strolled along the river beneath the moon , enjoying more than ever before the matchless beauty of the nocturnal wonderland  --  this , because they were together ! Sitting beneath the trees they watched the never old , never tiring game of hide-and-seek between moonbeams and water ripplets . They also listened for their friend , the south wind . That charming fellow  --  spirit messenger of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly around their heads , while playing gently through the braids of Wynoma 's long hair . He sang sweetly and happily into their eager ears , seeming to enjoy , as much as they , this little get-together of old acquaintances . As the two discussed their mutual experience on that June night of nights , in which the south wind had played such a vital role , and disclosed to each other the intimate communion each had experienced with the other that memorablenight , Sauwanachen hummed merrily through the treetops , as if proud of his part in that unusual meeting of the minds across the miles of summer night air ! This happy reminiscence was a fitting prelude , blending perfectly into a night of bliss in each other 's arms ! It was late in the autumn moon of dry grasses when theyp340returned to Metamoristown . Winter had not yet ravaged the scenic valley with its chilling winds and icy fingers . The blue haze lay heavy around the hilltop cliffs of the ancient Mound Builders . Indian summer had followed the first October cold snap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple began living normally and in earnest , establishing their own household , with Grandmother installed in a lodge close by and Sunflower and White Beaver just a few lodges down the long row of dwellings toward the river . Wynoma set about performingthe chores of a dutiful wife . Metamoris threw himself into the increasingly difficult task of obtaining enough meat to provide for the winter moons ahead . A short distance from the town , up a small branch , was a substantial spring of cold pure water . This spring , called by the red men " Butternut Spring , " because a grove of butternut trees graced its banks , was one of the principal water sources for the villagers . Wynoma and her women friends made daily trips up the winding path to the spring for the precious water . One warm Indian summer day Metamoris and Wynoma walked leisurely over the northern hills framing the pleasantvalley . They followed the Butternut Spring path for a short distance , then turned left and climbed a high hill , on which was located one of the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped like a loaf and was dotted with sugar trees . They paused on the summit to gaze at the beautiful , inspiring scene stretching magnificentlybefore them . They could see a long stretch of green valley terrain to the west , with the stream meandering along the valley floor . Across the lowlands were equally high hills rising abruptly from the south banks of the river . The smaller , but similarly impressive valley of Quiquingusangled northwestward to the right and behind them . As they stood there , locked in the beauty of the view , each was lost in thought . Finally , Wynoma spoke in her soft voice : " No matter how much I miss you when you 're away , my husband , I do not want you to slacken your efforts for our people  --  not because of me . " " I know that , Wynoma , and that is exactly what I wanted  --  and expected  --  to hear from you ! I intend to travel withp341Tecumseh and follow his lead wherever it takes me  --  unless you should become ill and need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill my humble place . " " No , my handsome traveler , not then either . Your work is more important than you or I or our lives together ! Your services are important or Tecumseh would not seek them . Our people come first . " " It seemed likely when I left him that the next trip would be west to the plains tribes , such as the Osages and the Sioux . " " That will be another long trip , wo n't it ? " " Yes . But it may be that I wo n't get to go . " " Why ? " she asked with interest , at the same time leaningclose to him and gazing into his eyes . They were lying side by side , on their stomachs , chins resting in their palms , looking out over the valley . " There is talk of Harrison calling another council next season to buy more land . William Conner spoke to me of it at your father 's town . If that occurs , this Iand right here will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not wish to see our chiefs attend such a council , but if it is called and they go  --  as they likely will  --  I should want to be present and oppose such a sale with all my strength ! " " Oh , but it would be a shame for us to be forced to give up this beautiful valley ! Why , we 've just started to live here  --  you and I , Metamoris . Already I love it dearly ! " " Nor do I wish to give it up , Wynoma , but I have a feelingwe 're going to lose it soon . " " Oh , Metamoris , that is bad ! You must go to that councilif it is held and try to persuade the Indians not to sell this beautiful valley . " A decided nod of agreement was Metamoris ' only response . The happy couple moved across the smaller valley of Quiquingus westward to a long low ridge commanding another choice view of the valley . Here the river makes an abrupt turn to the east . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily wooded plateau . Back of the ridge , to the north , was an extensive sugar-tree grove that supplied much of the village 's sugar supply . This had been a favoritehunting place for Metamoris as a boy . Armed with his small-sized bow and arrow and blowgun , he oftenp342slipped down its many paths in quest of small game . Here , in the spring , he found the largest mushrooms and , in season , the juiciest berries . Here he had learned many of the mysteries of the forest and grew from alert boyhoodto able manhood . Reaching the summit of the ridge they stood atop a grassy plot surveying their beloved countryside . Wynoma caught her breath in silent admiration . " This place is even more lovely than the other . Would n't this be a good spot for our lodge  --  where we could always view this valley ? " " That is what I hoped you would say , my precious wife ! I have always thought that , too . I spent many hours up here as a child and dreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close enough to water . The river is down there toward the setting sun and a spring is located back here to the north among the sugar trees . The water would have to be carried uphill . Perhaps a well could be dug . The whites are doing it in many places  --  and on hills , too ! " " Let 's do that , Metamoris , and stay here even if the whites do come ! " she cried in a spontaneous burst of enthusiasm . " We would be very happy up here , would n't we ? Can you not picture our children romping over this hill and through the woods back there ? " " Yes , I think I can if I try hard enough  --  or , perhaps , easy enough ! It 's really not hard to imagine , but it 's painful , considering that it may never come true . I can also visualize the white men cutting off all those trees down there and making this a barren ridge  --  clearing it off to plant his crops . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitter note . " Oh , Metamoris , " she answered desperately , tears glisteningin her eyes , " do n't torture yourself that way ! Surely , you and Tecumseh and Father can prohibit the other chiefs from selling this place we love ! " He shrugged his shoulders with a resigned air more of accepted despair than uncertainty as he answered : " Perhapswe can , my beautiful wife . " Then he turned to her with admiring and adoring eyes , saying : " You know , only your beauty can match the loveliness of this spot ! " " You 're kind , my husband , and say wonderful things to me ! Do you really think I am beautiful ? It seemsp343almost an insult to the Great Spirit to speak of me with the same words we use to speak of this place . " " I think not ! After all , you are both his creation of beauty in the world . Your beauty , compared to this scene of nature , shames the hills of Wapinepay , Wynoma ! Your skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky above us . Your form is as graceful as those sturdy trees down there . Your features are as delicate as the most beautifulflower that grows in the woods . Your eyes , my wife , are like the glowing stars on a clear , dark night . Your soft and shining hair would put to shame the sleekest coat that Machque ( the bear ) puts on in winter . What a beautifulcreature you are and what a charming picture you would make standing in front of our tepee here looking out over this valley ! " " Oh , my dearly beloved husband , how you do speak of me with flattering tongue  --  but I do love it  --  and I love you so much ! And , oh , we could be happy here , could n't we , Metamoris ? " " I can be happy with you anywhere , Wynoma , but , yes , we could be very happy here ! " " Then we shall call this place our Happy Land  --  looking forward to the time when we can come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be happy together ! " And Happy Land it was  --  even to the white settlers who moved there a short time later and heard the legend of the name applied by the Indians . Early the next spring , in 1809 , Metamoris stopped at Conner 's trading post on his way to Prophetstown . Glad he was that he did , too , for Conner possessed information that made his Happy-Land prediction to Wynoma propheticand her Happy-Land dream forlorn . " Harrison will call for a council at Fort Wayne soon , " the trader told him , with tongue in cheek
