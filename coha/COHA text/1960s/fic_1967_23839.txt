YOUR LOVER JUST CALLED A Story by John Updike The telephone rang , and Richard Maple , who had stayed home from work this Friday because of a cold , answered it : " Hello ? " The person at the other end of the line hung up . Richard went into the bedroom , where Joan was making the bed , and said , " Your lover just called . " " What did he say ? " " Nothing . He hung up . He was amazed to find me home . " " Maybe it was your lover . " He knew , through the phlegm clouding his head , that there was something wrong with this , and found it . " If it was my lover , " he said , " why would she hang up , since I answered ? " Joan shook the sheet so it made a clapping noise like muted thunder . " Maybe she does n't love you anymore . " " This is a ridiculous conversation . " " You started it . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone on a weekday and the person hung up ? He clearly expected you to be home alone . " " Well , if you 'll go to the store for cigarettes I 'll call him back and explain what happened . " " You think I 'll think you 're kidding but I know that 's really what would happen . " " Oh , come on , Dick . Who would it be ? Freddie Vetter ? " " Or Harry Saxon . Or somebody I do n't know at all . Some old college friend who 's moved to New England . Or maybe the milkman . I can hear you and him talking while I 'm shaving sometimes . " " We 're surrounded by hungry children . He 's fifty years old and has hair coming out of his ears . " " Like your father . You 're not adverse to older men . There was that Chaucer section man when we first met . Anyway , you 've been acting awfully happy lately . There 's a little smile comes into your face when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! " " I 'm smiling , " Joan said , " because you 're so absurd . I have no lover . I have nowhere to put him . My days are consumed by devotion to the needs of my husband and his many children . " " Oh , so I 'm the one who made you have all the children ? While you were hankering after a career in fashion or in the exciting world of business . Aeronautics , perhaps . You could have been the first woman to design a nose cone . Or to crack the wheat futures cycle . Joan Maple , girl agronomist . Joan Maple , lady geopolitician . But for that fornicating brute she mistakenly married , this clear-eyed female citizen of our ever-needful republic ? " " Dick , have you taken your temperature ? I have n't heard you rave like this for years . " " I have n't been betrayed like this for years . I hated that click . That nasty little **34;1968;TOOLONG click . " " It was some child . If we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convalesce now . " " It is Mack , is n't it ? That son of a bitch . The divorce is n't even finalized and he 's calling my wife on the phone . And then proposes to gorge himself at my groaning board . " " I 'll be groaning myself . You 're giving me a headache . " " Sure . First I foist off four children on you in my mad desire for progeny , then I give you a menstrual headache . " " Get into bed and I 'll bring you orange juice and toast cut into strips the way your mother used to make it . " " You 're lovely . " As he was settling himself under the blankets , the phone rang again , and Joan answered it in the upstairs hall . " Yes ... no ... no ... good , " she said , and hung up . " Who was it ? " he called . " Somebody wanting to sell us the World Book Encyclopedia , " she called back . " A very likely story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back onto the pillows confident that he was being unjust , that there was no Inver . Mack Dennis was a homely , agreeable , sheepish man their age , whose wife , Eleanor , was in Wyoming suing for divorce . He spoke of her with a cloying tenderness , as if of a favorite daughter away for the first time at camp , or as a departed angel nevertheless keeping in close electronic touch with the scorned earth . " She says they 've had some wonderful thunderstorms . The children go horseback riding every morning , and they play Pounce at night and are in bed by ten . Everybody 's health has never been better . Ellie 's asthma has cleared up and she thinks now she must have been allergic to me . " " You should have cut all your hair off and dressed in cellophane , " Richard told him . Joan asked him , " And how 's your health ? Are you feeding yourself enough ? Mack , you look thin . " " The nights I do n't stay in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack of cigarettes , " I 've taken to eating at the motel on Route 33 . It 's the best food in town now , and you can watch the kids in the swimming pool . " He studied his empty upturned hands as if they had recently held a surprise . He missed his own kids , was perhaps the surprise . " I 'm out of cigarettes too , " Joan said . " I 'll go get some , " Richard said . " And a thing of Bitter Lemon at the liquor store . " " I 'll make a pitcher of martinis , " Mack said . " Does n't it feel great , to have martini weather again ? " It was that season which is late summer in the days and early fall at night . Evening descended on the downtown , lifting the neon tubing into brilliance , as Richard ran his errand ; his sore throat felt folded within him like a secret , and there was something reckless and gay in his being up and out at all after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his back fence and walked down through a lawn loud with fallenleaves , though the trees overhead were still massy . The lit windows of his house looked golden and idyllic ; the children 's rooms above ( the face of Judith , his bigger daughter , drifted preoccupied across a slice of her wallpaper , and her pink square hand reached to adjust a doll on a shelf ) and the kitchen below . In the kitchen windows , whose tone was fluorescent , a silent tableau was being enacted . Mack was holding a martini shaker and pouring it into a vessel , eclipsed by an element of window sash , that Joan was offering with a long white arm . Head tilted winningly , she was talking with the slightly pushed-forward mouth that Richard recognized as peculiar to her while looking into mirrors , conversing with her elders , or otherwise seeking to display herself to advantage . Whatever she was saying made Mack laugh , so that his pouring ( the silver shaker head glinted , a drop of greenish liquid spilled ) was unsteady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same hands from which a little while ago a surprise had seemed to escape , at his sides , shoulder-high . Joan moved toward him , still holding her glass , and the back of her head , done up taut and oval in a bun , with blonde down trailing at the nape of her neck , eclipsed all of Mack 's face but his eyes , which closed . They were kissing . Joan 's head tilted one way and Mack 's another to make their mouths meet tighter . The graceful line of her shoulders was carried outward by the line of the arm holding her glass safe in the air . The other arm was around his neck . Behind them an open cabinet door revealed a paralyzed row of erect paper boxes whose lettering Richard could not read but whose coloring advertised their contents  --  Cheerios , Wheat Honeys , Onion Thins . Joan backed off and ran her index finger down the length of Mack 's necktie ( a summer tartan ) ending with a jab in the vicinity of his navel that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pale and lumpy in the harsh vertical light , looked mildly humorous but intent , and moved forward , toward hers , an inch or two . The scene had the fascinating slow motion of action underwater , mixed with the insane silent suddenness of a television montage glimpsed from the street . Judith came to the window upstairs , nut noting her father standing in the massy shadow of the tree , and , wearing a nightie of lemon gauze , innocently scratched her armpit while studying a moth beating on her screen ; and this too gave Richard a momentous sense , John Updike , who lives in Ipswich , Massachusetts , has published three volumes of short stories and is now working on his fifth novel . crowding his heart , of having been brought by the mute act of witnessing perilously close  --  like a child sitting alone at the movies  --  to the hidden machinations of things . In another kitchen window a neglected teakettle began to plume and to fog the panes with steam . Joan was talking again ; her forward-thrust lips seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mack paused , shrugged ; his face puckered as if he were speaking French . Joan 's head snapped back with laughter and triumphantly she threw her free arm wide and was in his embrace again . His hand , spread starlike on the small of her back , went lower to what , out of sight behind the edge of formica counter , would be her bottom . Richard scuffled loudly down the cement steps and kicked the kitchen door open , giving them time to break apart before he entered . From the far end of the kitchen , smaller than children , they looked at him with blurred , sheepish expressions . Joan turned off the steaming kettle and Mack shambled forward to pay for the cigarettes . After the third round of martinis , the constraints loosened and Richard said , taking pleasure in the plaintive huskiness of his voice , " Imagine my discomfort . Sick as I am , I go out into this bitter night to get my wife and my guest some cigarettes , so they can pollute the air and aggravate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back yard , what do I see ? The two of them doing the Kama Sutra in my own kitchen . It was like seeing a blue movie and knowing the people in it . " " Where do you see blue movies nowadays ? " Joan asked . " Tush , Dick , " Mack said sheepishly , rubbing his thighs with a brisk ironing motion . " A merefraternal kiss . A brotherly hug . A disinterested tribute to your wife 's charm . " " Really , Dick , " Joan said . " I think it 's shockingly sneaky of you to be standing around spying into your own windows . " " Standing around I I was transfixed with horror . It was a real trauma . My first primal scene . " A profound happiness was stretching him from within ; the reach of his tongue and wit felt immense , and the other two seemed dolls , homunculi , in his playful grasp . " We were hardly doing anything , " Joan said , lifting her head as if to rise above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tension , her lips stung by a pout . " Oh , I 'm sure , by your standards , you had hardly begun . You 'd hardly sampled the possible wealth of coital positions . Did you think I 'd never return ? Have you poisoned my drink and I 'm too vigorous to die , like Rasputin ? " " Dick , " Mack said , " Joan loves you . And if 1 love any man , it 's you . Joan and I had this out years ago , and decided to be merely friends . " " Do n't go Irish on me , Mack Dennis . ' If I love any mon , ' t is thee . ' Do n't give me a thought , ! addle . Just think of poor Eleanor out there , sweating out your divorce , bouncing up and down on those horses day after day , playing Pounce till she 's black and blue ? " " Let 's eat , " Joan said . " You 've made me so nervous I 've probably overdone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you can excuse yourself by trying to make it funny . " Next day , the Maples awoke soured and dazed by hangovers ; Mack had stayed until two , to make sure there were no hard feelings . Joan usually played ladies ' tennis Saturday mornings , while Richard amused the children ; now , dressed in white shorts and sneakers , she delayed at home in order to quarrel . " It 's desperate of you , " she told Richard , " to try to make something of Mack and me . What are you trying to cover up ? " " My dear Mrs. Maple , I saw , " he said , " I Saw through my own windows you doing a very credible impersonation of a female spider having her abdomen tickled . Where did you learn to flirt your head like that ? It was better than finger puppets . " " Mack always kisses me in the kitchen . It 's a habit , it means nothing . You know for yourself how in love with Eleanor he is . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the quixotic . " " The divorce is her idea , you know that . He 's a lost soul . I feel sorry for him . " " Yes , I saw that you do . You were like the Red Cross at Verdun . " " What I 'd like to know is , why are you so pleased ? " " Pleased ? I 'm annihilated . " " You 're delighted . Look at your smile in the mirror . " " You 're so incredibly unapologetic , I guess I think you must be being ironical . " The telephone rang . Joan picked it up and said , " Hello , " and Richard heard the click across the room . Joan replaced the receiver and said to him , " So . She thought I 'd be playing tennis by now . " " Who 's she ? " " You tell me . Your lover . Your loveress . " " It was clearly yours , and something in your voice warned him of . " " Go to her ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant energy that made her , on other hungover mornings , rush through a mountain of housework . " Go to her like a man and stop trying to maneuver me into something I do n't understand ! I have no lover ! I let Mack kiss me because he 's lonely and drunk ! Stop trying to make me more interesting than I am ! All I am is a beat-up housewife who wants to go play tennis with some other tired ladies ! " Mutely Richard fetched from their sports closet her tennis racket , which had recently been re-strung with gut . Carrying it in his mouth like a dog retrieving a stick , he laid it at the toe of her sneaker . Richard Jr. , their older son , a wiry nineyear-old obsessed by the accumulation of Batman cards , came into the living room , witnessed this pantomime , and laughed to hide his fright . " Dad , can I have my nickel for emptying the waste baskets ? " " Mommy 's going to go out to play , iJickie , " Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buy a Batmobile . " " Yippee , " the small boy said limply , glancing wide-eyed from one of his parents to the other , as if the space between them had gone treacherous . Richard took the children to the five-and-ten , to the playground , and to a hamburger stand for lunch . These blameless activities transmuted the residues of alcohol and phlegm into a woolly fatigue as pure as the sleep of infants . Obligingly he nodded while his son described a boundless plot : " ... and then , see Dad , the Penguin had an umbrella smoke came out of , it was neat , and there were these two other guys with funny masks in the bank , filling it with water , I do n't know why , to make it bust or something , and Robin was climbing up these slippery stacks of like half-dollars a story by John Updike 51 to get away from the water , and then , sec Dad ... " Back home , the children dispersed into the neighborhood on the same mysterious tide that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned from tennis glazed with sweat , her ankles coated with dust . Her body was swimming in the rose afterglow of exertion . He suggested they take a nap . " Just a nap , " she warned . " Of course , " he said . " I met my mistress at the playground and we satisfied each other on the jungle gym . " " Maureen and I beat Alice and Judy . It ca n't be any of those three , they were waiting for me half an hour . " In bed , the shades strangely drawn against the bright afternoon , a glass of stale water standing bubbled with secret light , he asked her , " You think I want to make you more interesting than you are ? " " Of course . You 're bored . You left me and Mack alone deliberately . It was very uncharacteristic of you , to go out with a cold . " " It 's sad , to think of you without a lover . " " I 'm sorry . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " I said really a nap . " In the upstairs hall , on the other side of the closed bedroom door , the telephone rang . After four peals  --  icy spears hurled from afar  --  the ringing stopped , unanswered . There was a puzzled pause . Then a tentative , questioning pring , as if someone in passing had humped the table , followed by a determined series , strides of sound , imperative and plaintive , that did not stop until twelve had been counted ; then the lover hung up .
