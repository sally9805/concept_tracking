The avant-garde is suffering from intellectual hemophilia . It seems temporarily bled out of fresh ideas . The off-Broadway enterprise called Theater 1965 , run by Producers Clinton Wilder and Richard Barr and Playwright Edward Albee , is trying to supply some new blood by professionally producing experimental work by young U.S. dramatists , but except for scattered , fitfully exciting moments , the points of view are derivative , repetitive and predictable . <P> &gt; Balls , by Paul Foster , stars two spotlighted pingpong balls that throughout the play swing back and forth over the pitch-dark graves of two long-dead though volubly tape-recorded sailors . Dramatically grave-robbed from Beckett , this is a good isometric exercise for the neck , but lames the brain . <P> &gt; Up to Thursday , by Sam Shepard , is an Ionescute little shadow play replete with vapid teen-age antics . An impudently hilarious finale features a boy and girl twitching with copulative ardor under an American flag to the swinging beat of a Beatles ' record . To dodge the charge of desecration , the play uses an out-of-date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Home Free ! , by Lanford Wilson . A poignant fairy-tale quality pervades this story of a brother and his incestuously pregnant sister and helps the play achieve an astonishingly tender tension between sickness and sweetness . The boy ( Michael Warren Powell ) and girl ( Joanna Miles ) live in a fantasy playroom of imaginary companions and real toys , such as a miniature Ferris wheel . The atmosphere has a suffocating intimacy , an airless immunity to reality that recalls Cocteau 's Les Enfants Terribles , with its similarly incestuous relationship . Reality finally intrudes with cruel pathos as the girl 's birth pangs become her death throes . <P> &gt;Pigeons , by Lawrence Osgood , tries to strut like Albee-cum-Pinter . The most aggressive of a trio of women attempts to invade the privacy of spirit and being of the others , to get not only under the skin but into the psyche . Lacking Albee 's venom or Pinter 's menace , these are three dead pigeons . <P> &gt; Conerico Was Here to Stay , by Frank Gagliano , gives another squeeze to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard stigmata-conformity , terror , absence of identity , lack of responsibility and commitment-yet after he is stranded on a Manhattan subway platform , the vulnerable humanity of Mark Gordon 's expressively modulated performance makes one care about him . Gagliano has a gift for capturing the acrid flavor and jagged tempo of the city 's mental and physical derangements . A blind man , his white stick rattling frenetically , goes into a convulsive attack of " the crazies " as the city 's noises slash unendurably at his brain . A girl ( Linda Segal ) is raped by a pair of subway toughs , and the agony of it is its casual lack of horror . Despite the madness and the hurt , Playwright Gagliano keeps a funny tongue in his head , and , after a fashion , even redeems his antihero . <P>
