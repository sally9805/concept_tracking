When the 1964 Brazilian military coup ousted Leftist Joao Goulart and installed President Humberto Castello Branco , one of the country 's most desperate needs was an infusion of private foreign capital . Goulart 's free-spending ways had so fanned chronic inflation that the annual increase in the cost of living was nearly 150% . Foreign investors had started paring their spending plans . Many companies had contemplated shutting down and forgetting the whole thing ; one , International Harves ter , did just that . Now , only 21 years later , a dramatic reversal is under way . <P> Dimes and dollars , francs and yen are again swinging down to Rio and the rest of Brazil . <P> Last week Alcoa won final government approval of a proposal to spend $56 million building a new aluminum plant . Also last week United Brazilian Minerals , which is 49% owned by Cleveland 's Hanna Mining , was granted the right to mine and export iron ore and eventually to manufacture steel , an ambitious $600 million enterprise . The two new projects were only the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to pump in some $60 million , starting with a new fertilizer plant for which ground has already been broken . Union Carbide will expand its operations to the tune of $62,300,000 . International Harvester has not only reopened ; it is also spending $30 million to expand its truck line and build its first tractors in the country . <P> Climate : Favorable . Strongest showing of all is in the Brazilian auto busi ness , among the world 's top ten and the country 's biggest industrial employer . <P> Volkswagen , already Brazil 's leader , plans to up production from 420 to 500 vehicles a day within a year , will spend at least $100 million for plant expansion . <P> Willys-Overland is sinking $60 million into new facilities , will make a new line of Renaults by 1968 . Ford is introducing its first passenger car , a version of the Galaxie , in February at a cost of $30 million . General Motors will put up $52 million and also enter Brazil 's passenger-car market , probably with its Opel . Even Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The reasons for the foreigners ' return start with Castello Branco . While he has slowed but by no means halted inflation ( the cost of living is up 39.5% this year ) , he has demonstrated an encouragingly tough-minded intent that investors do not think will be reversed . The cruzeiro 's exchange rate has been held at 2,200 to the dollar for more than a year , taxes are being collected more diligently , credit has been tightened , and the constant wage increases have been slowed . Moreover , his persuasive economics minister , Roberto Campos , has beat bushes abroad convincing hesitant investors that now is the time to get in . Says National Economic Development Bank Director Jayme Magrassi de Sa : " International businessmen have always looked on Brazil as an excellent long-term prospect . Now there is a favorable political climate . "
