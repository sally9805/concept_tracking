txt A technique common to capitalist countries seems to be easing the troubles of Communist agriculture here in Hungary Workers on collective farms . Instead of sharing equally in the profits in the true Marxist way , are paid wages based both on the type and the amount of work they do When Hungary first began setting up collective farms after World War II , agricultural output started to lag behind industrial growth . All the profits of each collective went into a pool , and there were no pay incentives to induce one farmer to work any harder than any other . As a result , the workers on each farm settled on the production level of the laziest or least efficient men in the group . With the institution of " piece-work " wages in recent years , production has been steadily climbing , even coming close to ambitious government goals . According to United Nation fir.tie.2 Hungary 's farm output rose 10% in the 1957-1960 period , compared with a government target of 12% . Use of " piecework " wages here is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its satellites to spur not only farm output but industrial production as well . The . Free Life Farm The Free Life Cooperative Farm on the outskirts of this city is rated by the government as one of its most successful collectives . " We are having our record year , " says Gyula Varjas , the 39-year-old farm manager . " Our sales of farm products this year should total about $612,000 , as against last year 's 5440,000 . " With prices about unchanged from last year , the gain will reflect increased crop yields , although this will stem at least partly from unusually favorable weather . Once each month , the farm 's 372 members line up at the pay office to receive their wages On one recent payday , Sandor Nagy , a 58-year-old man of slender build , presented a work slip showing he had earned 72.74 " work units " taking care of 32 sows and 218 little pigs , he received the equivalent of about $73 . " Everybody is paid according to the work he does . " says manager Varjas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk and explains , " Every kind of job you can do on a farm is described In this book , along with the number of work units that can be earned on each job " The Free Life Farm was founded in 1950 , when 17 farm families , at the urging of the government , pooled their holdings totaling 250 acres , As new members have been added , the farm has grown to its present 5,000 acres . Each farmer is paid annual rent for the land he brings in , a system which , like piece-work wages , smacks more of capitalism than of communism . Rent varies from collective to collective , but on the Free Life Farm it averages about $4.50 an acre each year . Membership in a collective theoretically is voluntary , but considerable government pressure is placed on farmers who balk As a result , about 90% of Hungary 's farm land now is socialized . Household Plots When a farmer enters a collective , he retains his farm home and his personal property If he has any machinery or livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Free Life Farm may retain a plot of no more than 1 25 acres to raise vegetables ; it also may keep a cow and calves , two pigs and a litter and any number of chickens . Individual members are n't permitted to own horses . " Owning a horse puts capitalistic ideas into a man 's head , " explains manager Varjas . Each member of a collective has one vote , with a general assembly of members running the farm . The members elect a president , who serves as manager ; in Free Life Farm 's case , this is Mr. Varjas . The farm operates under close government supervision and control , of course . Mr. Varjas has 12 ' leaders " or foremen who supervise various phases of the farm 's operations . Each leader assigns tasks to the workers in his " brigade . " With jobs rated according to skill , a tractor operator will earn more work units than a common laborer  --  provided he works as hard as the laborer If the tractor operator loafs , he may end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quality of work also enters into computation of work units . When a man paints a barn , for example , his leader examinee the job to rate the worker 's performance . If a man ploughs a field , his foreman checks the depth of the cut and the distance between furrows . If any arguments develop , manager Varlets settles them .
