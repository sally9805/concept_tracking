Passed from hand to hand under tables , slipped under doors , sent anonymously through the mails , an old and notorious piece of anti-Catholic propaganda turned up last week in scattered cities and towns , mostly in the South . Part of a spreading anti-Catholic campaign against Presidential Candidate John F. Kennedy , the document purports to be the oath of the Knights of Columbus , a 1,000,000-member fraternal order of Roman Catholic men ( Kennedy is a member ) . Sample quote from one version of the fake oath : * " I do further promise and declare that I will , when opportunity presents , wage relentless war , secretly and openly , against all heretics , Protestants and Masons , as I am directed to do , to extirpate them from the face of the whole earth . " <P> <P> This fraud , like the bogus Protocols of the Elders of Zion used against the Jews , has been spread by bigots for almost half a century . It first turned up in a congressional election in 1912 in a lunatic-fringe tract mailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional committee investigating unfair election practices condemned the oath as a fabrication . At that time , the false oath was read into the Congressional Record , a fact that present-day bigots cite to lend it an air of authenticity . Ku Klux Klanners circulated it against Al Smith in 1928 . It turned up again last spring during the West Virginia primary battle between Jack Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey . A scattering of clergymen have recently quoted it in sermons , and it has been printed in newsletters of Southern Baptist churches in Rainelle , W. Va. , Phoenix , Ariz. , Greensboro , N.C. and Knoxville , Tenn . One clergyman of the Nazarene Baptist Church , W. L. King , who quoted the oath and refused to retract when its fraud was pointed out to him , last week was charged with criminal libel in the magistrate 's court at West View , Pa . <P> <P> * Full text of the actual " obligation " taken by members of the Knights of Columbus ' top Fourth Degree : " I swear to support the Constitution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic citizen and a Knight of Columbus , fully to enlighten myself upon my duties as a citizen and conscientiously perform them entirely in the interest of my country , regardless of all personal consequences . I pledge myself to do all in my power to preserve the integrity and purity of the ballot and to promote respect for law and order . I promise to practice my religion consistently and faithfully , and to so conduct myself in public affairs and in the exercise of public virtue as to reflect nothing but credit upon our Holy Church , to the end that she may flourish and our country prosper to the greater honor and glory of God .
