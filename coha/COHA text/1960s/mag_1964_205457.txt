Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow . There is more to Sophia Loren than meets the eye , and Director Vittorio De Sica is the man who sees it . In Gold of Naples he showed the world that Sophia is socko as a liedown comic . In Two Women he gave the girl an accelerated course of Duse and don'ts that revealed enough talent for tragedy to win her a 1961 Oscar . And in this picture , a hairily hilarious but fundamentally innocent little comedy , De Sica displays Sophia as a warm and earthy and even rather subtle comedienne . <P> In Adelina , longest of the three short films assembled in Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow , Sophia plays a local girl who makes good by selling butts on the black market . Grimly the carabinieri come to arrest her . Proudly Sophia points to her tummy . She is pregnant , and Italian law provides that a pregnant woman may not be imprisoned-and neither may a nursing mother . <P> Boing ! A big idea explodes in Sophia 's pretty little skull : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with child . Next time the carabinieri come , Sophia once more proudly points-and the next time and the next . In approximately seven years she has seven babies , but before she can make it eight her husband ( Marcello Mastroianni ) collapses in sexhaustion . " Goodbye , " she bellows scornfully at poor Marcello as she is led away to prison . " Goodbye , you fairy ! " <P> In Anna , a brief intermezzo , Sophia plays a rich bitch who tries to persuade her bohemian lover that she does n't care a fig for her husband 's filthy lucre and all the disgusting bourgeois things it can buy . Like , say , the Rolls-Royce they are riding in . " Here , take the wheel , " she announces grandly . " I do n't care . I love you . " Maybe so . But by a strange coincidence the affair ends up on the rocks when the car ends up in a ditch . <P> <P> In Mara , most amusing of the three episodes , Sophia plays a prostitute with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is studying for the priesthood , starts to wonder what he really wants : salvation or Sophia ? Sophia is amused , but she puts business ( Marcello ) before pleasure . A man of imagination , Marcello jumps into bed and beseeches her : " P-p-pretend you 're a v-v-virgin ! " Sophia prepares to comply , but just then the grandmother of the boy next door arrives . " Help ! " the old lady hollers . " My grandson wants to leave holy orders and marry you ! " Marcello bites his nails until Sophia returns . " Let 's make love in the kitchen ! " he suggests with an eager leer . " Help ! " the old lady hollers again at the back door . " He 's going to join the Foreign Legion ! " And so on , till at last Sophia starts to strip , then suddenly stops . <P> " I just remembered , " she informs her stupefied customer . " I promised Our Lady that if that boy went back to the seminary I 'd give up sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In those three little words De Sica reveals what a sly old dog he is-while the audience is howling at Marcello , the director is secretly smiling at Sophia . Beneath a rather juicy sense of fun he conceals a very dry sense of humor . Dry is the word for Marcello 's humor too-time and again he gives up a laugh to get a grin . Smart feller . In this picture the laughs belong to Sophia .
