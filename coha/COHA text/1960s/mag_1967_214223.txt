An outdoorsman 's hunting ground it may be , but L. L. Bean , Inc. is also an efficiency expert 's nightmare . It stashes incoming mail in shirt boxes . Once it lost $125,000 in business when a list of 40,000 would-be customers was mistakenly destroyed . Under a garish , multicolored letterhead , its owner once answered a formal appointment request by advising " I am personally away more or less . " When he died of a heart ailment during a Florida vacation last week at 94 , L. L. ( for Leon Leonwood ) Bean left a $4,000,000-a-year backwoods bonanza that could have been far bigger had he ever branched beyond tiny ( pop . 4,000 ) Freeport , Me . But Bean liked his sportsman 's supply business the way it was . " I get three good meals a day , " he once said , " and I ca n't eat four . " <P> Bean believed , and was obviously content in proving , that " it takes a sportsman to design equipment for sportsmen . " For more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wares of his own making to grizzled backwoodsmen as well as fugitives from Abercrombie &; Fitch . Among those who bought his snowshoes , fishing tackle and what have you were Bernard Baruch , Eleanor Roosevelt , Babe Ruth , Doris Day and Amy Vanderbilt . To meet the demand , Bean employed 120 workers , also maintained a 24-hour-a-day , 365-day-a-year ( " When hunters need something , they want it right away " ) retail outlet . But 80% of his sales were mail orders , generated by a quaint , cluttered catalogue that utterly delighted its 400,000 readers . <P> Loud Whistle . The semiannual catalogue , as fascinating for prose as for merchandise touted , contained more than 400 items ranging from Bean 's Improved Sandwich Spreader to a collapsible bait bucket . Many of the goods Bean designed himself ; most he personally tested on the trails . In a spare , hardsell style that would be instructive to many an advertising copywriter , the catalogue once plugged a Combination Compass , Match Case and Whistle by noting that " the Whistle is loud enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toter , a stretcher ingeniously rigged to a bicycle wheel , was described as a contrivance on which " your deer looks so much better than when dragged over the ground . " The catalogue also promoted Bean 's two highly successful books . One of them , Hunting , Fishing and Camping , a slender , lore-packed manual , sold 150,000 copies , contains duplicate chapters so woodsbound readers can clip parts out , still leave the tome intact . The other , a rambling , disjointed autobiography , is entitled simply My Story . <P> The story really began when L. L. Bean was 39 . The orphaned son of a Maine horse trader , he had until then bounced from job to job . But he was an avid woodsman , and in 1912 , while trudging on wet , blistered feet through the forest , he suddenly hit upon the idea of a boot with a rubber bottom attached to a leather top . From that inspiration came the famous " Maine Hunting Shoe " - which a hunter , Bean later boasted , " might like better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually expanded into other lines , and his factory grew into a labyrinth of makeshift additions and rickety dumbwaiters.
