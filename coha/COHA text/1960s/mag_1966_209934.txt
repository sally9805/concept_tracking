ALTHOUGH they have had their share of close calls , the TIME correspondents covering the war in Viet Nam had , until last week , come through unscathed . On Washington 's Birthday , Pentagon Correspondent John Mulliken , on a two-month tour of duty in South Viet Nam , became our first casualty . He was wounded - fortunately only slightly-by a sniper 's bullet while on a search-and-destroy mission with the U.S. 25th Infantry Division 's 2nd Brigade in a patch of woods 20 miles northwest of Saigon . The bullet drilled a clean hole through the heel , missed the bones . Mulliken , a combat veteran of World War II , took the matter lightly , cabled his wife from the hospital about the precise area of his injury : IF YOU WANTED TO <P> SHOOT YOURSELF , THIS IS THE SPOT YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO DO THE LEAST DAMAGE . To the Silver and Bronze stars he already holds , his colleagues in the Washington bureau plan to add a third citation : the Order of Achilles . <P> <P> IN the nine years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned , scissored , or otherwise censored in that country so many times that we 've lost count . This was thin-skinned Kwame Nkrumah 's way of registering his displeasure with stories that were frank and detailed about the " Redeemer 's " oppressive regime and his economic mismanagement of a promising young nation . Another form of damaging official harassment has been the on-and-off exclusion - and in one case the arrest-of our reporters . <P> When Nkrumah 's leftist police state was toppled by a military coup last week , TIME 'S editors were eager for coverage . First off the mark was Correspondent Friedel Ungeheuer , based in neighboring Nigeria , who flew into Accra a few hours after the coup and was able to get his file to the editors just under the Saturday-night deadline . <P> Significant as the immediate news was , both Writer John Blashill , who toured South and West Africa in January 1965 , and Senior Editor Edward Hughes , who reported to TIME from Africa for 21 years in the ' 50s , envisaged a story that would place the coup in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , correspondents tapped their sources in London , Paris , Washington and several posts in Africa itself . Writer Blashill found especially useful the perceptive chapter on Ghana in a new book , African Powder Keg , by Ronald Matthews , our correspondent in Tunisia . A source closer to home , a Ghanaian student working as a file clerk in Manhattan 's Time &; Life Building , proved knowledgeable about the new leaders in Ghana . His cousin is one of the top men in the new regime .
