The U.S. Air Force rates Lockheed 's needle-nosed F-104 as its finest interceptor . But in West Germany , the Starfighter has won a different label : " the flying coffin . " <P> The Luftwaffe 's fleet of some 700 modified Lockheeds has been decimated by crashes . Last week the 60th and 61st went down . The losses-26 alone in 1965-have created a public furor in West Germany , and subjected the Luftwaffe to severe criticism . <P> The trouble dates back to 1958 , when former Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss , hoping to win a bigger voice for West Germany in NATO , picked the free world 's hottest plane . In order to stretch the F-104 's capabilities into those of a bomber , the Germans installed so much additional electronic gear that pilots called the plane " a flying physics laboratory . " <P> It has proved far too sophisticated a plane for West Germany 's fledgling 100,000-man air force . The new Luftwaffe pilots were either overage World War II veterans with almost no jet experience or untried youngsters . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draftees , who barely learned their jobs before their 18 months ' service was finished . Poor maintenance has kept an average two-thirds of the Starfighters grounded , and pilots have not gotten sufficient practice to master the plane . While NATO procedures recommend 20 flying hours per month for F-104 pilots , the Luftwaffe average has been 13 or less . <P> The Luftwaffe 's problems have been compounded by its NATO-assigned mission : to fly under the Soviet radar net and toss 100-kiloton U.S.-owned A-bombs on tactical targets . Such a mission calls for great skill in low-level flying , the most dangerous altitude for speedy jets . Germany 's poor weather has made learning the art especially hazardous . <P> Pay Raise . Under prodding from outraged politicians , the Luftwaffe is working at top speed to improve its safety record . Pilot training has been transferred to Luke Air Force Base in Arizona , where in clear skies seasoned U.S. instructors are teaching German cadets how to handle one of the world 's most unforgiving airplanes . The Luftwaffe is setting up a new maintenance system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to service the Starfighter 's electronic gear . Pilots ' pay has been almost doubled , to $137.50 a month . The improvements are coming none too soon . The number of volunteers for Luftwaffe pilot training has nosedived from 471 in 1957 to only 134 last year .
