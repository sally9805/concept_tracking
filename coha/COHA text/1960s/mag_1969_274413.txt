In the field of ecology , who deserves a dunce cap this week ? According to Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson , the prize goes to the International Boundary Commission , which is now in the process of defoliating a 20-ft. - wide strip between the U.S. and Canada . The main purpose , says the commission , is to help establish jurisdiction in border disputes and plane crashes . Excluding water , the strip will extend over 2,964 miles of land . <P> What upsets Nelson is the fact that engineers are cutting the strip by spraying picloram , the same pesticide used by the U.S. military on the Demilitarized Zone in Viet Nam . The chemical kills sizable trees and brush vegetation for at least two years . In a letter to Secretary of State William Rogers this week , Nelson protests : " In effect , we are creating a North American DMZ , a sort of environmental disaster strip in the midst of some of the most magnificent wilderness country on earth .
