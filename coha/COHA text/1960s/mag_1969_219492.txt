Before Winter Comes is a film to be remembered-rather than seen . It has a vague plot , conventional camerawork and a feeble scenario . But it also serves as the major debut of a major performer : Israeli Actor Topol . <P> Topol has starred before-in Sallah , a minor movie produced and shot in his homeland . But this is his first leading role in an international big-budget project . It is difficult to see where the money went . Certainly little of it was spent developing the story . In an army camp , circa 1945 , a British major ( David Niven ) tries to impose order on an overflow of displaced persons . From the serried ranks a leader named Janovic emerges . As played by Topol , he is a sleight-of-tongue artist . Janovic can lie in a dozen languages and seduce a girl with the drop of a decibel . He is also a deserter from the Russian army . <P> Although he likes to play the Eternal Survivor , Janovic can not avoid the relentless Red pursuit . The slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With an indefinable accent , Topol handles the script 's half-aphorisms with more panache than they deserve ( " It is easier to know ten lands than one man " ) . His hypnotic combination of shy manner and sly authority steals the film from Niven-a feat comparable to picking Dillinger 's pocket . <P> Born in 1935 , Chaim Topol began his show-business career as a barracks clown in the Israeli army . His performances became such a morale factor that headquarters ordered him to be an actor . He has been following those orders ever since . Topol 's most important future role is Tevye in the film version of Fiddler on the Roof . <P> There could be no better choice . Tevye is the very image of an impoverished Jewish father who makes his ragged clothes seem every bit as fair as Joseph 's coat . After turning Before Winter Comes into a movie , Topol should find Fiddler a vacation .
