txt A Gaullist party leader won a clear victory in a by-election in Dijon today , improving the outlook for the political survival of President de Gaulle , who has staked his presidency on a referendum to be held in June . In labor negotiations at the same time , the Government gave way step by step . to major demands of workers who have held the economy at a standstill for a week .. But there seemed little prospect of an immediate general return to work . Understanding was unofficially reported to have been reached on the following mat-ters : 41An increase in the minimum wage to an average of 3 francs an hour from an average of 2.22 francs , a rise of 35 per cent . The rise is roughly the equivalent of an increase to 60 cents an hour from 45 ' cents . tIA general 40-hour week . The legal work week now varies from 40 hours up .

The nation as a whole enjoyed its first really peaceful day  --  except for a turbulent rally of former Algerian settlers in Toulouse  --  in some time . But as the debris of battle was still being cleared from the Latin Quarter , the Paris students ' area , and from the university sector of Bordeaux , the student federation called for demonstrations tomorrow . Gaullists Get 2 Seats The election in Dijon , a Burgundian city of 141,000 , demonstrated that the strike and student-police battles had not necessarily been fatal to Gaulllist prospects . At stake were the Municipal Council seats of the late Canon Felix Kir , the colorful leftist Mayor and Resistance hero , and Rend Dumas , a conservative , who resigned . Both were antiGaullists . The seats were captured by Robert Poujade , 40-year-old Isecretary general of the Gaullist party , and an associate , Maurice Lombard . The vote offered an interesting test of public sentiment because it was the second round of an election in which the first round was held last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Mr. Poujade and his running mate came only 147 votes short of a majority . In the first round the Gaullists received 18,673 votes to , // 6,572 for the non-Communist Federation of the Left and 6,500 for the Communists . A municipal party and the Democratic Center party divided 5,893 votes . The total was 37,638 . In the second round , the Communists and the local party urged their followers to sup ? port the Federation of the Left . The Center Democrats , who were also eliminated , were silent . The new results were 24,504 for the Gaullists and 20,471 for the Left Federation , a total of 44,975 . Allowing for the sharp rise in the total vote , it would seem that the Communists ' supporters and those of the local party followed instructions but that more voters , including antiGaullist conservatives , had turned out for the Poujade ticket . The implications of the Dijon election were supported by a similar second-round by-election in Poissy , west of Paris .

Setback on Wages Seen Meanwhile , representatives of labor and employers and a Government group headed by Premier Georges Pompidou were in their second night of negotiations , with the wage-andhour adjustments reportedly agreed upon . Nevertheless , officers of the Communist-led General Federation of Labor , by far the largest of the union groups represented , said that the day 's sessions had marked a setback in the rate of progress . Taking a tough line , they said the wage accords were still tentative and would not be accepted unless agreement was won on the remaining ' key issues . These are a repeal of changes last year in social security rules and  --  most difficult of all  --  assurance that a rise in the cost of living would not erase the workers ' gains . Change Due on Benefits The social security reform , which cut medical benefits , was unpopular and was considered likely to be repealed , at some loss of face to Mr. Pompidou . A guarantee that wages be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , almost certain to run into opposition from the national employers ' association , generally known as Patronat . Patronat entered the negotiations with a warning against rises in costs that would price French exports out of the world market , but it is not in a strong bargaining position . The Government is by far the largest employer and hence will set the pattern . In addition , it has the authority to raise minimum wages by decree . It is regarded as inevitable that any substantial , raise for employes on the minimum wage  --  estimated to number a million out of France 's 14.8 million wage-earners ? would spread to higher-paid categories . In reply to a question , one labor negotiator said he thought the economy could absorb the wage increases without raising consumer prices ? that is , the costs could come from profits of employers and distributors . The Government has power to freeze prices or to limit price increases .

Mr. Pompidou was reported to have urged negotiators in the labor talks to push on to-1 ward a settlement without pausing for sleep . An agreement would still have to be submitted to the workers for ratification , however , so that a full-scale return to work would take several days . Government employes , including railroad , transit and power workers , are in separate talks , but these marked time yesterday , evidently waiting for the pattern to he established by the major negotiations . The talks were held in an elegant hall of the Ministry of Social Affairs , a marble mansion near the Invalides , where Napoleon is buried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at the head of a rectangular , green-felt-covered table , flanked by 40 labor and employer negotiators . At the far end sat three delegates of the National Teaching Federation . They were not originally invited , but gained admission after a protest . The exclusion was symbolic of the divorce between the students and teachers , on the one hand , and the labor movement on the other . The General Federation of Labor and the Communist party called again on their adherents not to participate in the demonstrations called by the student federation and repeated a warning against " provocateurs . " Even before the present upheaval began four weeks ago , the Communists were at odds with extremist student groups . They marched together once , in the great protest May 13 against police brutality . Leaders of the National Student Union have struggled to avert violence at their demonstrations , but serious clashes have followed many . The latest was in Bordeaux last night , when 150 students and six policemen were injured . No negotiations have been set up yet for reform of the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have repeatedly promised such a reform . Meanwhile , most of the universities and some high schools remain in the hands of students , and ' the school system remains paralyzed by a teachers ' strike . The Government leaders are preoccupied , however , with possibly more urgent affairs . A special Cabinet meeting tomorrow will tackle some of them , including the wording of the referendum General de Gaulle has announced . Meanwhile , ministers of the Common Market will convene a two-day session at Brussels on milk and meat prices and subsidies  --  with a mass delegation of French farmers on hand . Premier Pompidou has promised them France will fight for them " resolutely , step by step . " Frenchmen followed the labor negotiations only by radio . There are few Sunday editions of newspapers , and these were distributed only with difficulty . Journalists of the Government television network have struck because the authorities rejected their demand that opposition leaders be permitted a rebuttal to President de Gaulle 's speech of Friday night .
