txt LONDON , June ** Anthony Eden called today for " a political general staff " of Western leaders to enable free countries to stand up to " the monolithic mass which is the Communist world . " The former Prime Minister of Britain , addressing a rally of Young Conservatives at Wetherby , Yorkshire , declared : " There must be much closer unity within the West before there can be effective negotiation with the East . " It was Sir Anthony 's first major public speech since he resigned as Prime Minister in 1957 after the Suez crisis . His address was a critical assess . ment of Western diplomacy and ! a pessimistic look at the " cold war . " New Approach Urged To counter the Communist tactics of subversion and infiltration , he said , the West will have to align more closely its ' policies and the military , political and economic methods for making them effective . " Clearly this is not going to be done by the ordinary dayto-day methods of diplomacy within the free world , or by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or of foreign ' secretaries , " he said . " Something much more thorough is required . " Citing the " indispensable part " played by the Allied Joint Chiefs of Staff in the later years of World War IL Sir Anthony said : " Without them , all would have been confusion and disarray , each ally playing its own hand in its own part of the // world , often without an understanding of another ally 's Interests , sometimes regardless of them : " This is exactly what has been happening between the politically free nations In the postwar world . We need Joint chiefs of a political general staff . " The former Prime Minister said he did not think the number of nations that would be on such a proposed staff a matter of great importance . But he hoped it would be " not less than four nor more than six . " Such a staff , he said , might meet either in Paris or Washington . He declared that the unity of the free world was " not even beginning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the danger was not that of a nuclear war , but of " the attrition of the free world by methods of infiltration and subversion which the Communists understand so well . " He asserted : " The Communist pressure , as we know , will continue all around the periphery of the free world , It may be Laos , or Iran , Berlin or Africa or Cuba . The probing will be continuous . , The free world has to gird itIself to meet it . It has not yet done so . " Sir Anthony found very little to please him in the state of ' the world today . Within the last year , he said , there has been an increase of ' power among the Communist dictatorships and the countries that work with them in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean . He also noted a growing threat of similar developments in the Middle East . " This very grave state of affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality of the danger that con'fronts them and unite their policies and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view was expressed to a Yorkshire Labor women 's rally at Leeds by an ! other former Prime Minister , Earl Attlee . Lord Attlee , who ' led the British Labor Government in the immediate postwar years , appealed for international action to " get rid of war and destruction . ' " The world must do what we do in this country  --  submit their problems to law , " he said . He called for a world police force with international inspection . Lord Attlee said that the Rus. sians were doing " fairly well from their point of view " and that they had acquired things they did not want to lose . They have built up great industries and cities and do not , want them destroyed , he continued . According to Lord Attlee , the Russians know a world war would mean the destruction of both capitalism and communism . They are , he said , as confident of their doctrine as Britons are of theirs . , " Let us meet and get rid of war and destruction altogether , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement forward but is afraid to move because it does not know what the people want .
