Even dictators face death , and on that certitude Spain 's Francisco Franco , 76 and ailing , has for months been fashioning a succession to his liking . Three months ago , he decreed the restoration of a constitutional monarchy after his death ; at his direction , Spain 's Parliament designated bland , handsome Juan Carlos de Borbn y Borbn , 31 , as eventual Chief of State . To ensure that the actual governing of Spain will be in expert hands , Franco has also been planning the Cabinet that he wants to leave in charge of the country . Last week , in the most important Cabinet changes in his 30 years of power , El Caudillo made known his choices . <P> Franco had two contending groups from which to choose . One was the Falange , the blue-shirted quasi-fascist organization that helped catapult him to power during the Civil War and has been a major source of his political strength ever since . The second is a shadowy group of technocrats who belong to or sympathize with a Roman Catholic organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Cross and Opus Dei . It was Opus Dei last week that gained the Franco patrimony . At least ten of the 19 members of the new Cabinet are associated with it in some way . <P> Opus Dei ( the Work of God ) might also be called Octopus Dei . Most of its lay members are professional men who pledge to strengthen their Christian lives by improving the world around them . They accomplish this in part by appointing fellow members to key government and commercial posts . Opus Dei adherents are known to control almost all of Spain 's banking and a large share of its communications media . " They have the frying pan by the handle and the handle as well , " runs a Spanish expression , meaning that members have both power and the will to use it . <P> Not Necessarily Liberal . The leading member of the group is Planning Minister Laureano Lpez Rod , 48 . A onetime administrative law professor . Lpez Rod is a protg of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco , who is Vice President and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probable choice for Premier under a restored monarchy . El Caudillo apparently listened when Carrero Blanco and Lpez Rod pointed out to him that the competent Opus Dei technocrats would do less boat-rocking than the Falangists . As a result , technocrats got key posts in the new Cabinet announced last week . Gregorio Lpez Bravo , 45 , the former Minister of Industry , was promoted to Foreign Minister . Technocrats also took over the finance , commerce , industry , housing , information and tourism posts . <P> Falangists greeted the appointments angrily . Shouting " Falange , si . Opus Dei , no ! " , they demonstrated through Madrid 's streets last week . Other Spaniards pointed out that the appointments by no means indicate a shift to a less dictatorial Spain . Said one Madrileno , who belongs to the order himself : " This means an economic opening up to Europe , but it does not necessarily mean liberalism at home . There is not one man on the list you could call even moderately left . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
