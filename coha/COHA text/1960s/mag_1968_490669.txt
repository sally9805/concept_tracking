THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ACORDING to most red-bIooderi motorists , speed limits were meant to be broken . Ever since 1905 , when Albert Einstein presented his first paper on the special theory of relativity , physicists have been telling us that the velocity of light is the absolute speed limit in die universe ; that is , no wave or particle of energy or matter can conceivably travel faster than one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second  --  not even on a clear day with a good tail wind and the top down . This basic law of modern science has now been challenged by Dr. Gerald Feinberg , of Columbia University , who has postulated the existence of things called " tachy ions " ( from the Greek word for " swift " ) . These hypothetical particles are supposed to travel at supervelocities up to " infinite speed , " and if the Feinberg theory is correct , it means that man may someday he able to communicate with , and even travel to , incredibly distant galaxies that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and eighty-six thousand in.p.s . The trouble is there is rut , experimental evidence as yet to confirm the existence of tachyons , and Dr. Feinberg admits that the search will not he easy . But lie thinks the effort should he made . Why ? In a recent interview , he explained that it was a feeling of being " hemmed in " hl the old speed limit that led to his taking a second look at the Einstein equations . Nut so long ago , men thought that the planet they lived on was the center of the universe . Today , we are aware of living in one corner of an intolerably , large universe , on a planet that seems to he growing intolerably small . Those who seek escape in speed alone arc always doomed to he disappointed , but in the breadth of imagination that enables a man to feel constricted by the velocity of light we may yet find the clue to our salvation . The Moment THEsanitation workers had re- turned to their jobs , but New York had the look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sacks staffed with garbage stood in ding heaps in front of apartment buildings , and the high winds that swept through the streets picked up hits of refuse and carried them along , lining the gutters with torn newspapers , crushed milk cartons , orange-juice cans , and other trash . Paper fluttered from the hare branches of shrubs , and a kind of urban sediment began to collect along the curbs ? a fine , eclectic substance that looked like colored sand . In a gutter on West Forty - third Street , a broken umbrella rested beside a tattered paper lei . At the corner of Forty-fifth Street and Sixth Avenue , the wind seized a sheet of newspaper and took it suddenly aloft , lifting it above a cigar store and carrying it past the windows of Beneficial Loans and across the facade of Phil 's Bowling Alley , where its horizontal flight ceased for a moment as it hovered near the building 's roof , turning and flapping as though it would go even higher . Then it took a swift plunge downward , past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the Blarney Stone Restaurant , settling to the sidewalk as gracefully as a well-constructed kite . Outside the School of Performing Arts , on West Forty-sixth Street , two girls and two boys talked and laughed , passing the time between classes . One of the girls had an onion roll , which she was dividing and offering to the others . In the street , traffic moved sluggishly , with six taxicabs lined up one behind another . The girl with the onion roll said to one of the boys , " You know what 's your problem ? You 've got a good voice , but you do n't project enough ) . " Pushing his hands into his pockets , the boy shifted from foot no foot , and said , " I ca n't stand cabdrivers . " Then he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted , in full-throated , resonant tones , " I ca n't stand cabdrivers ! " The drivers of the cabs in the street drove slowly toward Sixth Avenue , apparently . unperturbed . Hubert 's Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , between Seventh and Eighth Avenues , was filled with the sounds of hells , rolling metal halls , simulated rifle shots , voices , and music from a radio that had been placed on a shelf near the middle of the large room . About twenty people  --  mostly young  --  were playing coin-operated games : Batting Champ , Ski ' n ' Skirt , Playboy , and Captain Kid Gun . Near one wall , a young man sat at a device called Turnpike Tournament , twist-Mg a steering wheel and trying to maneuver on a filmed roadway that flashed by on a screen in front of him . bear the entr.nce of the Museum was a life-size animated model of a cowboy . A teen-age boy stood in front of the cowboy , tiring an electronic pistol at it . After he had fired several times , a recorded voice drawled , " You missed , you polecat . You 're not as fast as you thought you were , are you ? " The tin , without reply Ong , walked away . At the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirick , scientific director of the Health Research Council , an organization established ten years ago by the city to stimulate medical research and to foster the careers of scientists engaged in medical research here , was talking to a visitor . " The Council is composed of forty-two scientists and laymen  --  they are appointed by the Mayor  --  and fifteen officials of the city government , " 1 ) r . Mirick was say ing . " Our annual budget is seven million dollars , half of which is provided by the state , and we spend it in the following ways . Through our Career Scientist Program , we give financial assistance to a hundred and eighty researchers , who , for the most part , are young assistant professors at local medical schools . The idea is to encourage these valuable people to remain in the city , where , through their teaching and their clinical contacts , they will help raise medical standards and improve health care . Special grants for research projects arc made to scientists who need funds to work on important problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and environmental pollution , and methods of improving the delivery of medical care to ghetto districts . We also support research into many other problems , including alcoholism , arthritis , blood diseases , diabetes , hepatitis , heart diseases , diseases afflicting infants and children , and metabolic and glandular disorders . Tn addition , the Council maintains a laboratory-renovation program that over the past five years has helped to create more than a hundred research facilities in which its career scientists and project grantees can carry out their work . " On Spring Street , just west of Lafayette , on the fourth floor of a dilapidated loft building , Leon Wiener , the manager of the Olympic Rubber Company , was strolling through a nail , where blue and red toy hallthms were being turned out by an automated machine eighty-four feet lung and ten feet wide , which included a conveyor studded with ten thousand aluminum molds  --  some finger-shaped and some round . At the start of its cycle , the conveyor carried the molds into a vat containing a rubber-coagulant solution . Then it sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the molds in a tank of bright-blue latex and half in a tank of red , and after that it passed them between rows of revolving brushes , which made a lip on each balloon by rolling down the edges of the rubber adhering to the upper part of each mold . Then the balloons were cleaned in a tank of water . At the far end of the machine , the conveyor carried its cargo up into a huge drying oven and hack to the starting point , where a pair of hard-pressed , perspiring workmen plucked the finished balloons from the molds by the handful and dropped them into cartons . On the sixth floor of the Museum of Natural History , Dr. Ethel Tohach , a comparative psychologist , sat at her desk . Dr. Tohach , who has silvery hair , was wearing a dark-blue dress that went very nicely with it . A few months ago , she and her colleagues had made an unexpected observation that suggested a new line of inquiry to them , and she was eager to get on with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing , but that , she said , was often true of new observations . She and her associates had been conducting experiments on the role that the sense of smell plays in the development of baby rats , who are horn without sight . She had found that newborn rats become aroused when they arc placed on wood shavings that come from their own nest . To determine whether it was the sense of smell that was responsible for the excitement , Dr. Tobach and her colleagues had destroyed the sense of smell in some bahy rats , and , sure enough , they were then unable to distinguish between their own home shavings and others . Recently , Dr. Tobach and her associates had made the additional observation that the rats whose sense of smell had been destroyed were completely unable to take their mothers ' milk , and it was this peculiarity that Dr. Tobach was preparing to study next . " It may turn out that the olfactory sense plays a much more important role than we formerly thought in determining whether baby animals that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Tobach wrote in a memorandum . Up at Columbia University , Harold K. Bell , a builder and real-estate investor who has taken a leave of absence from his firm to become director of the Urban Action and Experimentation Program in the School of Archi tecture , was addressing a few students on the subject of the program . " The time has come to attack the crisis in our cities on a total basis , " Mr. Bell declared . " I believe that the nation 's universities provide an ideal starting point , because they have people of talent and training who can see beyond the confines of the political arena and perform the vitally important function of involving business and the private sector in the task of rebuilding our blighted urban areas and of giving on-the-job training to the disadvantaged people who live in them . During the past eight months , we have persuaded thirty of the city 's major corporations to help us plan and institute Urban Action Projects . At the present time , fifty executives from our member corporations arc teaching in business-opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to provide jobs for two thousand so-called hard-core unemployables , who are being trained in the South Bronx Concentrated Employment Program . In addition , we have formed a consi  --  rtium , spearheaded by the Celanese Corporation , that will build low-cost , low-rent housing units in upper Manhattan , in the Model Cities area in the south Bronx , and in Bedford-Stuyvesant . It 's an encouraging start , and I 'm hoping not only that the program will expand here in New York but that similar projects based upon cooperation between academicians and businessmen will he instituted in other cities throughout the country . " At the United Nations , the thirty-two delegates ( all but four of them women ) to the Commission on the Status of Women were debating a draft resolution that proposed the creation of regional seminars in family planning and the integration of women into economic life . The Soviet representative , a stocky , red-haired woman wearing an electric-blur dress and jacket , declared that her delegation did not agree with the wording of Paragraph 3 . " It would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive activities ' rather than ' the integration of women into economic life , ' " she said . " We are also opposed to the inclusion of family planning as a subject for these seminars . " After a moment of silence , the delegates from Tunisia , Cyprus , France , Ghana , Finland , and the United Arab Republic registered polite but firm opposition to both Russ'an suggestions . " I think we are all saying the same thing in different words , " said a " Oh , well . It 's all in the family . " blond Finnish woman in a tweed suit . " This is the first year We are to study the relation between family planning and the status of women , and it would be very difficult for my delegadon not to include it as part of the agenda . " The Russian delegate tapped her pencil irritably on the desk . " We would request , " she said , " that the report of the Commission should mention that certain members are opposed to the inclusion of family planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're not suggesting formally that we delete this , but you want the objection registered ? " said the chairman , a cool , polite woman , who spoke in French . " That is correct , " the Russian said . " In our view , family planning is a matter for the family itself and not within the purview of the state , the United Nations , or these seminars . " Two of the men on the Commission  --  the delegates from Iraq and Iran glanced at each other and smiled . " Shall we go on to Paragraph 4 ? " the chairman asked briskly . At Carnegie Hall , Vladimir Horowitz , who was taping his first television recital to he broadcast by C.B.S . at some undetermined time ) , was rippling through a Chopin Ballade before an enthralled audience . He was surrounded by three television cameras , the first pointing up from the front of the orchestra , the second focussed on his face across the top of the piano , and the third  --  mounted on a dolly  --  prowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a morning coat , a four-in-hand tie , and an expression of anguish . The television crews wore dark-gray suits , tiny transistorized headsets , and black leather bedroom slippers . Toward the end of the Ballade , when the mobile camera crept across the front of the stage for a closeup of Mr. Horowitz 's hands , its crew froze . The cameraman peered through his viewfinder , hack arched , arms raised , elbows out ; the dolly operator bent forward from the waist , clutching the kind of plunger handle that usually sets off a charge of dynamite ; two assistants , spaced ten feet apart , held up a thick black electric cable resembling an inert python . Mr. Horowitz polished off the Ballade with his usual delicacy and precision , leaned back for a second , and wiped his face with a handkerchief . As the first wave of applause engulfed the stage , the dolly operator pushed his h.indle down and moved the camera back to the wings . The two cable holders executed an intricate ballet to keep the power line from doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bow , and a camera on the far side of the piano turned around and photographed the audience . At the Rockefeller University , an English neurophysiologist , Dr. A. Grey Walter , was about to begin a lecture entitled " How We Think the Brain Thinks . " Dr. Walter , who is a handsome man with a thick gray heard , waited patiently as the lecture room filled up and then spilled over with Rockefeller scientists , who , being notably brainy people , would he expected to take a proprietary interest in the subject . A young lady with her left leg in a plaster cast came in last , and two men offered her their seats , The cast was covered with a pattern of psychedelic flowers . At the rear of the room , a scientist in a white smock prepared to take notes on a pad of yellow paper . Then the lights went down , and a slide was projected  --  a picture of the human brain seen from the front . Dr. Waiter pointed out the frontal lobe . " The frontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day contain just the reference you want , " he said . " It 's not so much for incoming mail . It 's like the pile of old magazines I keep in my office . " The scientist in the smock jotted down on his yellow pad , " Frontal lobes : Old magazines . " As Dr. AValter 's voice FEBRUARY 2 4 , 1 9 ( 9 8 went on , the scientist wrote , " 84 electrodes in 1 patient . " Dr. Walter had wired the brains of several patients with electrodes in order to tune in on the brains ' activity . Lots of wavy lines flashed on the screen . These were , quite literally , brain waves . " The brain 's a great gossip , " he said . " There 's lots of background chatter in the different circuits . It 's like a teletype operator sending nonsense signals to keep a line open . " He flashed several pictures of intercepted thoughts on the screen . As the thoughts became more complicated , the lines on the screen became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scientist took another note : " Curiosity aroused in male patients by girls in miniskirts . " Twelfth Avenue was bleak , cold , and nearly deserted . A wind off the river blew in gusts down the slips between the piers . The river was clear of ice , but the inner third of the slips was filled with floes several inches thick and jammed solidly together . A cruise ship lay quietly at its pier , with no one in sight ; half a dozen blocks uptown , a few flags fluttered pluckily between the masts of another . If one looked through the open door of a pier shed overflowing with people , cargo , trucks , and cars when a ship is in  --  a quiet , cavernous expanse stretched away , empty except for the guard in their room by the door . Across the avenue , three men huddled over a fire in an oil drum , and a few blocks north a steady stream of burdened police tow trucks turned off the avenue toward the river . Nearby , a fenced lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheds up Jere were full of trucks , and fork lifts darted about . A guard at the gate of one checked nut a vast trailer , and when it had pulled away , he turned to a bystander and said , " You know , we have n't had a ship in here since Thursday . We had one due today , but they 're all caught in storms on the ocean . " Over at the East River , the Belgian Line pier was aswarm with longshoremen loading and unloading two ships . The larger of the ships , the Moliro , had come in from the Gulf the day before and was loading for the Congo and Angola . The other ship was the Atlantic Star , and she had just come in from the West Indies . Her sides were coated with ice . Crewmen were hacking it off the railings , and some still clung to the cargo booms . Four- fort hales of sisal were swung up nut of two holds and dropped on pallets on the pier , where fork lifts scooped them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is corner of the pier , between the two ships , were half a dozen tall stacks of two-hun- dred and - eigh ty- pound blackish copper ingots . A flatbed truck was pulling away with about two hundred ingots , stacked four high . In the warehouse , three ashes were formed by piles of bales , sacks , cartons , automobile tires , and crates of all sizes . In one spot near mounds of burlap bags stencilled " Haitian Coffee , " a mound of sisal hales was grow ing . There were pal- lets stacked high with cartons of detergent for Nassau , and several large cartons of dog food for Sao Vicente . Then there were sacks of coconuts . Alongside was a bundle of harrow discs for Luanda . A dozen large crates of glass vases were headed for Luanda , too . In another part of the warehouse , also for Luanda , were crated truck parts , and outside was some Luanda-hound heavy earth-moving machinery . There were crates containing piston cups , augers , hits , and rings , marked " Moliro-Lobito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extra Extra , " for Katanga ; dozen or so drums of pipel1ne enamel , for Angola ; half a dozen cartons of a drink called Great Shakes , for Lusaka ; some drums of lubricating oil , for Katanga , via Lobito ; several Westinghouse refrigerators , for Luanda ; and a great pile of sacks containing flour , also for Luanda . In the Smile Bar , a small establishment on Lexington , near Seventy-fifth Street , that has carved dark-wood panelling and tall liquor cahlnets faced with diamond-shaped glass panes , a dozen men were at the bar , most of them hunched over glasses of beer . Above the bar was a small sign that read , " A smile is something nice to see , . It does n't cost a cent . A smile is something all your own ? It never can he lent .

" My uncle had to go to a wedding in Mineola last Sunday , " Jules wrote , " so he gave me his ticket to the Rangers-Red Wings game that afternoon , and that 's how got to go to the last sports event at the old Madison Square Garden unless you count the Dog Show , which closed things up a couple of days later . The funny thing was , I did n't even know it was going to he the last game at the old place . Oh , I knew the end was coming , but there had been all those postponements , and I guess I never really thought it would happen . The outside of the Garden looked sort of quiet and heat-up that afternoon , but then the Garden has always looked quiet and beat-up in the daylight , like a street rummy on Sunday , and everything else was about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnuts out of those carts made out of old baby carriages , and there were lots of fathers taking their young sons , and maybe a couple of school friends of the son , to the game , the way there always are at a Garden matinde , and there were those men in the crowd in the outer lobby whispering at you to ask if you have any extra tickets , and the man selling the Hockey Ne.ns , and everybody pushing in , and I did n't notice anything different until I got inside and up in the side arena and saw a spectator standing on the back of his seat and unscrewing the sign that said ' Section 127 ' from the pillar behind him . He was taking it for a souvenir . I looked around , and I saw that almost all the section signs had been swiped already ; there were clean , light-green squares on the dirty-green pillars where the signs had been . Then I looked up at the scoreboard , to the part where they bill the coming attractions , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , F.DS CLOSED FOR NEW- GARDEN , ' and then I knew . " I found my seat , which was between a bald man wearing a turtleneck , who had brought his maybe tenyear-old boy along , and an older couple , who ( it turned out ) came from Schenectady and had never seen a big-league hockey game or been in the Garden before . I was anxious for the action to begin , because I 'd decided to remember everything I could about this historic game , but then I saw that they 'd put down some rubber matting and a microphone on the ice in front of the Ranger bench , over on the Forty-ninth Street side . I thought , Oh-oh , ceremonies , and a minute later , sure enough , an announcer introduced the president of the Garden , Irving Mitchell Felt , and Clarence S.

He skated very carefully , circling behind the goal at the other end , and then he stopped along the far hoards and waved , and everybody dapped . Another player , Baldy North-
