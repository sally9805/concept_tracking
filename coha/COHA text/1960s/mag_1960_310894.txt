Poet John Donne once listed " goe and catche a falling star " among life 's impossible jobs . And Air Force Captain Harold E. Mitchell , who had been assigned the chore , last week had reason to agree : he had missed the week before . His specially equipped C-119 Flying Boxcar , patrolling a 12,000-sq. - mi. patch of the Pacific near Hawaii , had tried to snare Discoverer XIII 's descending instrument capsule , coming from outer space , in midair . He almost caught it-but had to watch helplessly while the capsule fell to the ocean below , to be picked up by the U.S. Navy . <P> Narrow Margin . Last week Mitchell got another chance . Discoverer XIV had been fired atop a Thor-Agena rocket from Vandenberg , Calif. , and once again Mitchell 's squadron was alerted . Mitchell slapped a cap on his red-thatched head , kissed his wife and promised : " I 'll get it this time , honey . " This time he did . But the margin of success was narrow indeed . <P> For its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . At the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division in Inglewood , Calif. , the project officer , Colonel C. Lee Battle , listened gloomily as tracking reports filtered in . The news was bad : on only its second pass , Discoverer XIV started to pitch drunkenly ; its stabilizing jets , struggling desperately to halt the satellite 's violent gyrations , began draining precious fuel . Battle figured Discoverer 's fuel supply would be so low by the 17th circuit-when its instrument package was to be cut loose-that the capsule could not be aimed at the programed target area . He sighed : " We 're dead . " Battle 's pessimism was premature . When its erratic wobbling was corrected , Discoverer XIV 's tanks still held 1,000 lbs . of gas pressure - more than enough to launch its capsule directly at the target , a plot of ocean 390 miles southwest of Hawaii . <P> Dead Ahead . Four minutes after Discoverer 's capsule dropped back toward earth at an electronic command . Captain Mitchell picked up radio signals and spotted its brightly colored parachute , dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inverted V , hung twin 38-ft. booms ; between them , trapeze-fashion , stretched a nylon rope and a grappling hook with which Mitchell hoped to foul the cords of Discoverer 's parachute , snag its canopy . Winch operators would then take over , reel the dangling capsule into the plane . At 12,000 ft . Mitchell made a pass-and missed by a breathtaking 6 in . The parachute continued its float down . Mitchell made another pass at it at 10,000 ft. , but brought his Cng in too high . He wheeled back for a third try , which he knew must be his last . At 8,500 ft . Mitchell carefully made his final pass , heard a crewman shout : " That 's it . You 've got hold of it . " <P> For his " feat of great national significance , " Mitchell was promptly awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . And General Electric Co. hinted that a Discoverer capable of carrying a small primate-probably a chimpanzee-would be ready for firing into space within a month .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
