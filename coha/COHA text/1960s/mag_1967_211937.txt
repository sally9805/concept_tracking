" Americans have never been so overcommitted in foreign entanglements , " thundered a recent editorial in the Deseret News . " Never have their natural resources been so extravagantly used , never has the national deficit been so great except in times of all-out war , never have taxes been higher , inflation more out of hand ; never has youth faced a more uncertain future , never have there been heavier encroachments on personal liberty by an all-powerful federal government , never has crime been more ugly and broad , never the air more polluted , food , clothing more expensive-ad infinitum . " <P> So the voice of Mormonism characterizes the American scene from Salt Lake City . Deeply concerned with U.S. morals , the Deseret News ( circ. 90,224 ) finds them slipping everywhere - toward permissiveness , collectivism and individual irresponsibility . <P> The Church Comes First . Owned by the church , the News is closely supervised by the church . Three of its nine-man board of directors belong to the Council of the Twelve Apostles , the church 's governing body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned from their jobs to go on missions , and they never refuse . The paper accepts no ads for alcoholic beverages , cigarettes or even coffee-unless it is part of a general grocery ad . Staffers are not allowed to smoke in news offices . " It is church property : sacred , " says Managing Editor Theron Liddle . <P> <P> The News relies almost entirely on the wire services for national and international coverage ; it devotes its energies to local news and to church events . A banner headline once read : <P> <P> BEWARE OF EVIL , CHURCH TOLD . Despite its firmly conservative political views , the News never endorses a political candidate for local or national office . " We do n't believe religion and politics mix , " says Editor William Smart . George Romney , however , could present the paper with a dilemma . The first Mormon to be actively considered for the presidency , Romney also faithfully articulates the Mormon moral outlook . If he won the Republican nomination , the editors concede that they might break precedent and support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after Brigham Young and his followers arrived in Salt Lake Valley . According to the Book of Mormon , the word deseret means honeybee . For a while the News had Salt Lake City pretty much to itself . But in 1870 , the Tribune was started to " oppose the undue exercise of priestly authority . " Under the ownership of a wealthy Roman Catholic family named Kearns , the Tribune eventually surpassed the News because of its more comprehensive coverage ; it also made light of Mormon officialdom . The church pumped considerable cash into the paper so that it could compete . In 1952 both papers grew weary of battle and combined their advertising and business departments while they remained separate editorially.
