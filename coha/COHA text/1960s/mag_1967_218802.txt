" I 've never read any of the books , " says Yale Quarterback Brian Dowling , 20 . " But from what I understand , Frank Merriwell was quite a guy . " <P> Indeed he was . The kind of guy who would run from punt formation on fourth down and 26-and make 35 yds . Who would average 24 points a game for the Yale basketball team . Who would turn out for tennis , win his first two matches , and quit because his game was " not too good . " Who would then suit up for baseball and drive in the winning run in his first game . In other words , Frank Merriwell was a kind of fictional Brian Dowling . <P> Not since Princeton 's Dick Kazmaier won the Heisman Trophy in 1951 has an Ivy League football player so captured the public fancy as has Dowling , a 6-ft. 2-in. , 195-lb. junior from Cleveland Heights , Ohio , who turned down 100 scholarship offers to go to Yale-because , as his father put it : " Why go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Brian at quarterback , says a teammate , " You never know what 's going to happen-but you know that you 're not going to lose . " <P> Five Straight . A broken wrist sidelined Dowling for the first two games this season ; Yale lost one to Holy Cross 26-14 , barely squeaked past Connecticut 14-6 in the other . Since then , with Brian , the Bulldogs have rattled off five straight lopsided victories-beating Brown ( 35-0 ) , Columbia ( 21-7 ) , Cornell ( 41-7 ) , Dartmouth ( 56-15 ) , and Pennsylvania ( 44-22 ) to stamp themselves as one of the top teams in the East . <P> Despite tough games still ahead with Princeton ( 6-1 ) and Harvard ( 5-2 ) , Yale now is a solid favorite to win its first Ivy League title in seven years-barring further damage to Dowling . Injuries have been Brian 's biggest bugaboo since he was a junior at St. Ignatius High in Cleveland and broke his collarbone in a football game-the only game St. Ignatius lost during his four years on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year because of torn cartilage in his right knee ; this season , in addition to the tender knee and bad wrist , he has been playing with a broken nose . None of them have slowed him down much . Against Cornell , he passed for two touchdowns and ran 6 yds. for a third . Against Dartmouth he threw a 69-yd. scoring pass , scampered 30 yds. on a bootleg for a second Yale TD . Last week against Penn , he ran for 35 yds. and completed 13 out of 19 passes for 141 yds. and two TDs . <P> According to Yale Coach Carmen Cozza , Dowling is " neither a great runner nor a great passer . But he is a born winner . He uses all his ability to the utmost advantage and he has great response to pressure . " When he graduates in 1969 , Dowling hopes to test that response in the pros-which is something that not even Frank Merriwell had the courage to assay .                @ @ @ @ @
