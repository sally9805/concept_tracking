As a self-declared movement , pop art is more than just paint and plaster ; it is also a clangor of nonmusic , a babble of tape recorders , and the " happening , " a nonplay which requires one or two small rooms and the tolerance of the spectators . In short , a branch of show business . Last week Washington , earnestly aspiring to be the new cultural capital of the U.S. , was deep in something called " The Pop Art Festival , " staged by the Washington Gallery of Modern Art . <P> First came the neorealist show . On opening night , the confused guests sat down on the armchair that was part of Jim Dine 's painting called Four Rooms , and piled their champagne glasses into the porcelain sink ( painted black ) that is part of his lesser work , Black Bathroom No. 2 . Two days later came a " lecture " by Modernist Composer John Cage , who accompanied his own voice with three tape recordings of his own voice , thus saying four different meaningless things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climactic event , a happening called " Stars . " <P> <P> Blue Wrench . Happenings are old stuff in the artiest alcoves of Manhattan , but of course that means nothing in Washington square . This one was prepared by Artist Claes Oldenburg , who makes those huge sailcloth hamburgers . Washington society prepared by getting itself puffed , powdered and sloshed . Little dinners were eaten intimately in Georgetown . The jolly crowd then collected at the gallery to see what was going to happen . Nearly everyone sat on campstools-White House Art Adviser Bill Walton , FAA Administrator Najeeb Halaby , Mrs. Arthur Schlesinger Jr . Those . <P> A member of the gallery staff announced that she had successfully achieved blue ice cream . She had mixed blue dye and vanilla ice cream with a monkey wrench . The New Frontier moved an inch forward on its stools . <P> <P> This was obviously going to be some happening . <P> A cast of 19 performed-21 were listed but two did n't show up . " You just never know about this sort of thing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , each a minute long . Everything was sort of idiosymbolic . A huge white tube of canvas came wriggling into view , propelled by somebody underneath . Chuckle , chuckle-it 's the Potomac . The blue ice cream ended up in paper plates on a picnic table , making the point that Washington is a hell of a party town . Two men sprayed the place with Flit guns loaded with a foul-smelling mixture . The sex came a little later . A lively girl with dark doe eyes , dressed in a black oilcloth shift , set up an ironing board that had silver bells hanging from it and began to iron any number of medium-sized replicas of the Washington Monument . No one could miss the symbolism of that . The drama critic of the Washington Post splintered the stool he was perched on and crashed to the ground .
