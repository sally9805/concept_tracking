txt Palm Beach , May 4 ? President Kennedy today pleaded for passage of his broad tariffcutting bill and watched the air force show its manned craft and missile power in a special three hour demonstration . He flew into Palm Beach for the week-end tonight from Eglin Air Farce base , Florida , where he had congratulated the airmen on their pin-point missile and bombing displays and anti-guerrilla exercises . He hailed the airmen for manning freedom 's ramparts around the world . " Trade Or Fade , " He Says The President 's day took him from Washington to New Orleans , where he made a major speech for his tradetariff bill , then to Eglin field and on to Palm Beach , which he left only a week ago after a nine day vacation . In New Orleans the President asserted that America must " trade or fade " as freedom 's leader in what he called a showdown economic w a r with communism . The President told a trademinded audience in the nation 's second largest port of commerce that his program for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an Atlantic economic partnership with a trillion dollar economy . A trillion is a thousand billions . By 1970 , he said , this Atlantic community can by trade cooperation boost Its output 50 per cent td a trillion and a half . More Jobs , He Contends The President defended his tariff proposals against critics who say they would cost many thousands of Americans their jobs by opening domestic markets to low-cost , low-duty imports . The main point , he ; argued , is that under his program " new jobs opened thru trade will be far greater in number than any jobs which might be lost " ? Large , friendly crowds greeted the President at New Orleans International airport , on the 11 mile ride in an open car to the docks , and inside the 2,400 foot long wharf building where he spoke . About 10,000 persons listened to his speech there . A few home-made signs popped up along the Presidential motorcade route . Several had a Cuban anti-Castro theme , as " Is Cuba Fighting Alone ? " and " What About Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 's My Constitution ? " The most waggish banner in the Presidential path , however , was a huge one hanging from a fraternity house at Tulane university . It said : " Property of U. S. Steel . Hands Off . ' The president has tabbed his tariff , bill , entitled the trade expansion act of 1962 , as " must legislation " for this session of Congress . The bill is still being I considered by the House ways and means committee and has yet to reach the House or Senate floor . The measure would give the President wholesale powers ' to negotiate tariff cuts on a reciprocal basis with other countries . The cuts would be up to 50 per cent on many items and to 100 per cent leaving no tariff , on some . The chief executive told today 's audience the bill is essential for America to move ahead economically In stride with west Europe 's six nation common market , Japan , and other friendly industrialized countries . Borrows Churchill Phrase Kennedy , who likes to try to turn phrases with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point . This came when Kennedy said the negative answer to America 's future is to raise tariffs and cut foreign commitments . In his advance speech text he continued : " But this administration was not elected to preside over the resignation of America from its manifest destiny . " In actual delivery Kennedy changed " manifest destiny " to " responsibilities in these critical years . " The Churchill phrase from which Kennedy borrowed was spoken soon after World War II when British colonies were seeking independence . Churchill said : " I did not become the king 's first minister to preside over the liquidation of the Britt ish empire . " Challenge to Communists He asserted the proposed tar if f changes will also bring nem benefits to less developed land ! of Asia , Africa , and Lath America , " who will be able to buy more from ' industrializec nations by selling more good : in our markets . " " It will nose to the leaders o the communist world , " he said , " a direct , deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state discipline , Atlantic partnership will present the challenge of a system based on free choice . Against their dire predictions of capitalist collapse it will present the challenge of free nations working in harmony . " " New Frontiers of Trade " The President advanced three main arguments for his pro-gram : 1 . It will expand new Irontiers of trade instead of " ancient strongholds , of tariff protection . And thereby strengthen America and other free world economies . 2 . It will improve our national security by increasing exports , reducing the gold dollar deficit in the long run , and welding closer freedom alliances now patroled by American service men from Berlin 's Brandenburg gate to the Formosan straits . Partnership of Nations ! . 3 . The bill will strengthen United States foreign policy at " critical points " such as Latin American , where he said it is designed to keep our own markets open for Latin products and beat down barriers to such goods in other world markets . " What we are Moving toward , " he said " is an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade barriers that will draw the whole non-communist world together with the strings of economic self-interest .
