FALSE ENTRY , by Hortense Calisher ( 484 pp. ; Little , Brown ; $5.75 ) . <P> Author Calisher , whose elliptical New Yorker stories have brought her a small but fanatical following , has labored for six years on this first novel . Unhappily , she has brought forth a mousse : a gelatinous concoction inflated with whipped-in wind . The theme is " false entry into another person 's life , into his present by means of his past . " Simply , this means one man 's pretense that certain things happened to him that actually happened to someone else . The pertinence of the theme , symbolically or literally , is not made apparent , as the hero successively changes his name , testifies in a trial as an eyewitness to events he never saw , and later , on seduction bent , " enters " a girl 's life by pretending he knew her dead brother . In the telling , everything is hemstitched with the heaviest of literary embroidery . ( A telephone booth is " a slim , body-width oratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air . " ) Once in a while there are a few glints of true gold . ( " What we do not do persists , classic and perfect , beneath what we do . The final admixture is the judgment . " ) But the total effect of Author Calisher 's novel is like sipping gallons of weak , mandarin-style tea from a fur-lined cup . <P> I MET A LADY , by Howard Spring ( 448 pp. ; Harper ; $4.95 ) .

They were both beautiful , the one full-breasted , the other budding . " It was , thinks George , " a moment that belonged to the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and 400 pages , George lopes after Sylvia and Janet . After dithering a bit , he marries Sylvia , who is ten years his senior , rather than Janet , who is eight years his junior . Long practiced in the craft of writing family pageants .
