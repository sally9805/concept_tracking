txt The one school in the city where yesterday 's boycott was completely successful was P.S. 112 in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn . All but one of the school 's 475 pupils stayed home , and the lone exception was withdrawn when his mother learned the boycott was in effect . The school has 15 classes run1ning from kindergarten through the sixth grade . Aaron C. Pinta , the principal , is a graying , pipe-smoking man who has spent 26 years in the school system . He said he was " stunned " by the 100 per cent labsence record , particularly be'cause P.S .. 112 is not involved in the integration program . I " And it 's so out of the way that I doubt that it ever will be included , " he said . " We 're an open-enrollment school , which // UNPAIRED SCHOOL HAS100% ABSENCE // means that pupils from beyond our area are free to attend here , but so far none has taken ' advantage of it . Last year we , had no Negro pupils at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the neighborhood . " During school hours yesterday the teachers placed text books on the desks in their empty classrooms , caught up onl their record-keeping and visited back and forth . In one of the sunny , immaculate kindergarten rooms , Miss Rosemarie DelPAria. , the school librarian , said : " There are very , few schools left in the city like this one  --  quiet , well-behaved children who want to learn , cooperative parents , good , homes . It 's the kind of school , that no teacher wants to leave . " At 9 A.M. and again at noon a loose picket line of about 30 women and one or two men , not all of whom had children in the school , formed ott the sidewalk in front of the main entrance , at 15th Avenue andI 71st Street . " We know that eventually the Board of Education will come I down to our school with its ' plans , " said Joseph De Luca , of 1226 72d Street . Mrs. Celia Francaville of 2108 15th Avenue said : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my two girls coming home . I do n't want ' them riding any ' buses . " " The first thing when you 're buying a house you ask how , far is the school , ? how far is the subway , " said a slim blonde woman who held the hand of a preschool girl . " I 'd rather goi to jail than see my kids bused out of the neighborhood , and my husband feels the same way . " Like most of the other pickets , the young woman insisted she was not prejudiced , " I do n't care how Many Negroes and Puerto Ricans they bring here , " she said , " I just do n't want my kids leaving the neighborhood . " 1 Many of the older women who stood about , some of them ' grandmothers , argued that the children would suffer from mo tion sickness if they rode buses1 every day . Boycott Endorsed The president of the school 's parents ' association , Mrs. Beulah Arrigo , of 1466 74th Street , said the boycott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of 200 members . The very stability and homogeneity of the neighborhood appeared to contribute to the success of the boycott . The school draws its enrollment from an area that is lower middle class and overwhelmingly Italian'American . A group of 30 demonstrators from the Congress of Racial Equality gathered in front of the school at midnight . They said that they would hold vigil until 3 P.M. today to protest the boycott . Mank.of the parents who kept their children out of the school yesterday said , like Mrs. Emma , Brown of 6918 15th Avenue , that they themselves had grown up within a few blocks of their present homes . ?
