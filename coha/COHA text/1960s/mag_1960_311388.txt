It has a wiggly-hipped , exotic beat that sounds part Latino , part Arab . When the song is played at Geneva 's tonier-than-thou Chez Maxim 's , aging bankers and their young girl friends go into curious convulsions on the dance floor ; at least one U.N . functionary has been known to snatch up a tablecloth , wrap it around his waist and do a belly dance . In Paris the tune tumbles endlessly from Left Bank students ' rooms ; chefs abandon souffls to hear it . From Stockholm to Sorrento , Bandleader Bob Azzam 's Mustapha has spread like a rampaging fungus , is the biggest European juke and nightclub tune since Volare . <P> Tomato Sauce . Like 37-year-old Azzam himself-who was born in Cairo , lives in Geneva , drives a Chevrolet station wagon and speaks five languages-the song is a hybrid , Eurafrican polyglot . Written in French , Italian and Arabic , its lyrics may have been found in a Babel caf : <P> Chrie , je t'aime , Chrie , je t'adore , <P> Como la salsa del pommodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ya Mustapha . <P> Sabaa senine fel Attarine , <P> Delwati guina Chez Maxim 's . . . <P> All this is , more or less , the story of a fellah who once lived in the Cairo slum of Attarine , is now at Chez Maxim 's ( where Bandleader Azzam himself hit the big time ) , and adores his girl " like tomato sauce " ( salsa del pommodore in Azzam 's pidgin Italian ) . But the words do not matter . They merely complement the international melody , which tinkles like goat bells near the White Nile and clicks like the heels of an Andalusian gypsy . Scored by Azzam for bongos , flute , tambourine , echo chamber and his own voice , Mustapha is adapted from an Egyptian student song , but owes much of its popularity to electricity . When he plays the song at nightclub engagements or recording sessions , onetime Electrician Azzam surrounds himself on the bandstand with an impressive bank of hi-fi equipment , places a microphone before each member of his five-man combo , whirls dials feverishly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before a final electric impulse sends it shivering through the audience . <P> Fox-Oriental . Bob Azzam learned his electronics in the British Royal Navy , set up his own business after World War II , may have been discouraged by the outcome of his biggest contract , the complete wiring job for a pair of 200-room palaces belonging to Saudi Arabia 's Premier Feisal . Azzam worked for a year , putting in everything from air conditioning to electric-eye doors , but had trouble collecting bills and ended up without a profit . Turning to music , he organized a combo and began picking up engagements around the Levant , hit it biggest in Lebanon with his " slow rocks , " " fox rocks " and boleros . <P> The band caught the last ship when the Lebanese civil war broke in 1958 . In less than two years , Azzam &; Co. had driven the Continent wild on Mustapha ' s " fox-oriental " mixture . From then on , every thing was pure tomato sauce .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
