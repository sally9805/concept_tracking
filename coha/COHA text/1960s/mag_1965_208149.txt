To signal the start of a new regime , every presidential appointee in the Administration sent the President the traditional letter of resignation , and he is , of course , free to pick up any or all of them . But if Lyndon Johnson means to rebuild his team , he is certainly going about it slowly and cautiously . The word last week was that the President is seeking no major Cabinet changes , at least for the present , although Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon , HEW 's Boss Anthony Celebrezze , and CIA Director John McCone all may resign soon . Nor is Johnson rushing to fill the vacancy left by Bobby Kennedy , though the post may well go eventually to Nicholas Katzenbach , who is now Acting Attorney General . <P> But for the lower reaches of his Administration , Johnson wants to find in the next few weeks some 15 new " Little Cabinet " members ( assistant secretaries and under secretaries ) and some 35 agency heads and commission members . Some of the initial choices in that area were openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointees were selected for ability and experience . <P> Internal Revenue . As Internal Revenue Commissioner , a job left vacant since Mortimer Caplin resigned in July , the President picked Sheldon S. Cohen , 37 , who just a year ago left the Washington law firm of Arnold , Fortas &; Porter to become chief counsel at the Internal Revenue Service . There Cohen streamlined the legal branch , pruned excess personnel , installed automatic data-processing and microfilm files for his 650 attorneys . He hammered the point home to his staff that the Government 's aim in any tax litigation was not just to win the case but to set principles of law . Cohen hopes to build a friendly image for the 60,000-man service , said after his appointment : " I do n't want anyone to fear a visit from a revenue agent . Our people can disagree with taxpayers , but there is no need for them to be disagreeable . " <P> Treasury . As Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs , Johnson chose Frederick L. Deming , 52 , president of the Federal Reserve Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is joining a New York investment firm . Roosa will be a tough act to follow ; he was a key figure in the intricate international finance operation in November that poured a desperately needed $3 billion loan into the British treasury to prop up the sagging pound . But Deming , an economist with a Ph.D . from St. Louis ' Washington University and a career man in the Federal Reserve System for 23 years , was hand-picked in mid-1962 by Roosa himself to be his stand-by replacement in an emergency . Deming 's new job is one of the toughest in Washington ; it includes supervision of the Government 's domestic borrowing to finance the national debt as well as the international wheeling and dealing necessary to guarantee the stability of the world 's currency .
