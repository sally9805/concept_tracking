The scene opens on a street somewhere on the Lower East Side of New York City . It 's about 5:30 A.M. Garbage cans are near the curb ready for the Sanitation Department . There 's a slight chill in the air . An old Puerto Rican woman hauls the last can of ash up from the cellar of one of the houses , sets it in its place along the row of other cans , then disappears under the steps of her house . As the light grows stronger we make out the figure of COPPER QUEEN , who is sleeping on the top step of a brownstone stoop . She fights through drugs and drink to wake up . COPPER QUEEN ( tries to pull herself to a sitting position , but falls back . She rolls over on her belly and tries to focus her bleary eyes . She thinks she sees a man . ) Hey there , Mister this is your dance . Sidewalk 's as good a place as any . Say , Mister , you 've got my number . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I 'll let ya buy this little gal a great big drink Cig 's gone out . Buy me a buy me a ( Her mind clears a bit more and she sees the sidewalk . She wants to get to it , but it 's too far . This makes her angry , but first she tries to talk the sidewalk into coming closer . ) Why hello there pleased to see ya . I spot you down there , you sidewalk nine million miles away . Sure beats the hell out of me to know why this city builds its sidewalks so far down from the houses . By God Only a big city sidewalk would build itself so darn far away from a gal 's boot . Swallowed me a blue heaven , man Pretty Man dance ? ( She painfully pulls herself to a sitting position , and reaches for her bottle of wine . She thinks it 's farther from her hand than it actually is , so she reaches beyond it , and works back toward it . She repeats this several times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got ya , thought you 'd get away again , I betcha ? Ca n't get away . I take care a the important things . Getting too bright out . You S.O.B . ca n't make off with my wine .

Git to work . Got ta cut outta this here place soon 's I can see my way .

One pushes a baby carriage ; both search the garbage cans with expert hands and appraising eyes . B.A. , the larger of the two women , definitely the manager , wears many watches on each arm . She has three wigs on her head , each a different color and age . She wears one rubber glove and one canvas one . There 's a record book chained to her belt and several pens and pencils , on cords . The carriage she pushes sports an alarm clock . Several whisk brooms hang on the side of the carriage . The carriage is ancient , but polished and shining . B.A. 's clothes are strange , but they 're clean and ironed . CRISSIE is uncertain of her age , but she does know that she comes from San Francisco . She 'd never be seen on any street without her hat and gloves . Like B.A. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears one rubber glove , but the other glove is white lace .

CRISSIE Are you calling me , dear ? Did you want me , B.A. ? B.A. What do you think you 're trying to do to me ! CRISSIE I beg your pardon , dear ? B.A. Do n't beg my pardon . Give me an answer .

B.A. What 's this cardboard thing ? You know I detest cardboard . What is this waxed and runny lice-filled carton ? CRISSIE Let me see ? ( Reaches for it . ) B.A. Do n't touch it , you dope . It 's covered with germs . ( Takes some tongs that hang on the side of the carriage and gingerly fishes the milk carton out of the carriage and throws it into the garbage can . ) I 'll never get you trained . Why do I keep trying ? I 'll never get you to understand the true value of anything . CRISSIE Oh , B.A. , I know we could use it . B.A. Oh yes ? How ? CRISSIE Why I read in last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the A &amp; P that you just melt lots of different colored candles into one of these empty milk cartons , and then you sprinkle sequins on top , any color you like , and then behold ; you have a lovely , lovely Christmas candle that will burn the twelve days of Christmas . p. 5 B.A. At your funeral ! Do you realize you could bring typhoid into our home by picking up fifth like this ? Why you might as well drink water from a toilet . CRISSIE I 'm sorry , sorry , sorry , B.A. I thought it would be so pretty at mealtimes . B.A. We prospect for salable items . Will you get that through your head ? I do n't bring garbage into our home , and neither do you . We can buy a Christmas candle , if you have your heart set on one .

I told you I would , B.A. See here , look , B.A. See , it 's a little red jacket . ( COPPER QUEEN puts down her wine at the word " little . " ) A dear little child 's , little red jacket . COPPER QUEEN Child ? Dear little ? CRISSIE Yes , B.A. A dear little jacket . I can wash it in the boiler room and press it . You 'll get us a grand price on Orchard Street . p. 7 B.A. ( plucking the jacket from CRISSIE and going over it with expert care . ) Here mmmmmm I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down into a mine ! Mmmm perhaps not more than two bits , though . Is this the best you can do ? CRISSIE Oh a dear little child 's jacket as red as this should fetch much more than a quarter , I 'd say . COPPER QUEEN Was it a boy 's or a girl 's ? CRISSIE I said it was a child 's , B.A. It 's a fine jacket . A little boy I knew in San Francisco had a jacket like that . Do you suppose he lost it ? B.A. Nonsense . He could n't have lost it this far of course , he might have been visiting the city and lost it Did he come to New York often ? CRISSIE Not often , I think . I think he would not come too often . He was only five . B.A. Then it 's bound and determined that your friend did n't lose the jacket . So we 'll wash it and sell it on Orchard Street . Put it in the carriage . COPPER QUEEN He lost it a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely I fold you , little jacket See see there , B.A. ? p. 8 B.A. Idiot ! Do n't put it on that side , that 's where the blue pants go . Put it on the other side with red top wear . CRISSIE I 'm so sorry , B.A. I was too excited . Of course I know that red top wear goes here , and blue bottom wear goes there . B.A. There , that 's better . Balances the color inside the carriage better . I ca n't have a messy carriage . It 'll look like cheap linoleum . Order . We must have order or the carriage will collapse . CRISSIE Yes , B.A. See , it 's in order now . It 's balanced perfect balance B.A. ( considers a moment , then rearranges the jacket ever so slightly . ) There , that 's better . I have an eye for order you know . There .

CRISSIE I distinctly heard that poor young woman ask B.A. Just some whore sobering up . CRISSIE Oh , the poor little whore . B.A. Did you go through all these cans ? How about that one ? That one on the end ? CRISSIE I 'm just about to , B.A. I was on my way . B.A. Get your gloves in there . One twenty-five-cent jacket does n't get you off the hook for that milk carton .

There 's red heart-shaped babies , and black and white clown tinys and long ball-shaped littles and greenies with small colored balls and yellow-jacket bee-like sweeties and blue blue blue the color of Oops .

I got a hell of a habit to support . Where is he ? Oh , but this is good . I work , too . I work as hard as you two do , that 's what hung me about you two , seeing you prospect like a couple of Mountain Men looking through those litter baskets and garbage pans , placer miners , panning a rich stream . p. 27 B.A. Send you money , eh ? What is it ? They pay you to stay away ? COPPER QUEEN They 's generous . They do n't want me to come home like this . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need money in this town .

You do n't even have a mailbox . COPPER QUEEN Hell , I do n't want to be like this . But you want to know a secret ? CRISSIE Yes , yes . COPPER QUEEN ( to B.A .. ) And do you want to know a secret ? ( B.A. nods . ) I 'm a pushover . I guess I like it . I like to be dominated . I CRAVE being dominated ! B.A. You poor little girl . You better let me keep your money for you ; somebody would rob it from you the state you 're in . COPPER QUEEN It 's in this here bag . You keep it for a while . I would n't have it all in one place like that . It 's bad . ( Angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold .

I 'll tell you something , if you 'll bring me the baby to hold B.A. You tell first . COPPER QUEEN It 's something you wo n't believe ; it 's stranger than anything . I loved him since I loved anyone . No matter wherever I am that boy knows before I do . Do you know that he can find me within five minutes when I hit that Butte town . No more'n five minutes , and he knows where . I look around , I just might turn around , and there he is But you ca n't take a pimp home to yer father and mother . Do n't never try it . B.A. What a mess . COPPER QUEEN Can you imagine how I could take him home ? But that tender boy , he can find me no matter what day or hour or where , when I roll into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for ten years , and he 's loved me . Yes , he has ! B.A. Your people , do they know where you are ? COPPER QUEEN They think they know . But they do n't know , really . Fact is , they have never even been able to find me . You know why ? CRISSIE Why ? COPPER QUEEN Because they do n't know how to look ! ( Laughs. ) p. 29 B.A. Where do you live , girl ? COPPER QUEEN Butte , Montana . B.A. I mean in New York . COPPER QUEEN I live here and there , mostly there . ( Giggles . ) I 'm a transient . ( Looks at CRISSIE . ) You know , you have ' em in Cal . Them transient workers that follow the harvests and live in tents , like the Okies used to be . I 'm a Montana Okie . But dammit I can still work  --  if I could just walk . B.A. You work every day ? COPPER QUEEN I always work , no matter how stoned or hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers . Do n't matter how much bread you store in the box , everybody works in the West . You couldn'ta stayed alive in the West in the old days if you did n't work Do you work ? B.A. Of course , you just seen us . We do n't even take Sundays off . We start work while it 's still dark to beat the Bowery bums to the pickings . However , we 're better organized ; we 're business women , and we have a warm place to sleep . COPPER QUEEN I need that warm place a warm place to sleep . CRISSIE Let 's take her home with us , B.A. , the lonely little thing . p. 30 B.A. No room . CRISSIE Please , B.A. We could have at last someone to talk to , she and I. B.A. Her people would have us picked up for kidnapping . CRISSIE Why , she 's a grown woman , and besides , they do n't know our address . We 're unlisted ! B.A. Definitely we can not take her . CRISSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that means ! B.A. I talk to you , do n't I ? Who pulls out the plugs  --  who beats up the mixmaster  --  who holds you in the night when the brocade starts to fly ? CRISSIE Oh , B.A. , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to say it that way . I did n't mean to hurt you I B.A. ( indignant . ) I resent that ! I 've never been hurt in my life . CRISSIE She needs rest , poor thing . Look at the circles under her eyes . Please let 's take her to our basement and put her to bed , and then finish our picking . I 'll work twice as fast . I promise . B.A. She probably ca n't move . We ca n't afford any unmovable items taking space . Be months to get her into a decent salable condition . p. 31 COPPER QUEEN Think and see if you could know and maybe you could tell me why my mother just sat there on her needlepoint chair with her eyelids heavy like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she ! I tell you she knew it ! She saw me all sloppy and come staggering in higher than anyone can be , and she just sat there and pretended nothing was wrong . CRISSIE Our sitting room had needlepoint chairs . COPPER QUEEN How could she do that ? She sat there so holy and looking like an innocent lamb , looking with her eyes from one side of the room to the other like she did n't see me . She thought I was the wall and the stairs going up . But it was me all right ! I crawled past that wall . I was drunk ; I knew I was drunk and I called to her and I could n't see but she would n't touch me I just wanted to go upstairs and talk to my baby before he went to sleep . But she took him , and called him " Brother . " It ai n't legal . He 's my son ! CRISSIE Do n't you worry . We 'll find you a baby again . We find new things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can push the carriage all the way home if you want to . ( COPPER QUEEN nods and takes CRISSIE 's hands . ) COPPER QUEEN They were so good to me . We went down to Arizona to have the baby in a nice resort home . The best in the Southwest . Daddy came , too . It was the first vacation we 'd ever had , all of us together . Then they said I could come to New York and stay as long as I wanted . Forever , even and not have to live in a dumb small town they 're raising him like their own son they 're so good to him and they send me my money every month every liver-squeezing month She just sat there the whole time like the Virgin Mary She thinks he came straight to her from God She pretended I had nothing to do with it just between her and God Is ten years a long time to love someone ? p. 32 B.A. No time  --  hardly a turn in the litter basket . We have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was clean and good . ( Pockets the money . ) COPPER QUEEN Help me up now . I got to see that baby . CRISSIE ( pleading . ) B.A. B.A. Some other time .

Tomorrow morning at the same time . COPPER QUEEN ( struggling to her feet . ) I 've got to see that boy . ( Lurches  --  but regains her balance . ) B.A. Tomorrow , it 's too late now . CRISSIE ( ca n't bear to see COPPER QUEEN disappointed . ) Stop her , B.A. COPPER QUEEN ( staggers to the carriage , looks in , sees her own child there among the rags . ) Oh yeah O yeah baby . Hi lover ! Hi fat boy ! God you 've grown so . Me  --  I 've shrunk You do n't have enough covers She should cover you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ( She takes off her fur coat and painfully manages to get the coat tucked around the carriage . B.A. casts a satisfied glance toward CRISSIE . The coat is an unexpected bonus . ) Here , my honey boy . It 's cold in this city . That 's better , huh . Do n't look at me like that . Take me back . You know me ? You want me ? Take me back . You 're new enough to give me another chance . I 'll be good . I 'll go straight . I 'll be such a good Mommie .

The bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's found her baby , B.A. , and we 've found this  --  ( Holds her share of money . ) COPPER QUEEN ( rocking the carriage . ) Rock that boy , boy , rock-a-bye boy and a rock , and a rock , and a rickity boy rock B.A. ( taking COPPER QUEEN by the arm . ) I have an idea . It 's an orderly one , and fits in with the morning program . You station yourself here , while we run down to pick Avenue D. When we finish at six-thirteen we 'll hurry back and pick you up . And then you know what ? COPPER QUEEN No . What ? B.A. When we get back here , we 'll let you wheel the buggy all the way down to Avenue B. COPPER QUEEN Me ? You would trust me ?
