O.K. , all you teenaroons , it 's nostalgia time , as we move into the groove with the supersound of yesteryear ! Let me sock it to ya - the Beatles , a pow-pow-pounding boogie beat , four blattzing saxes and a nitty-gritty ditty called Lady Madonna ! Yeah ! <P> <P> But wait . The Beatles ' Lady Madonna is no golden oldie , as the disk jocks say-gone from the charts but not from our hearts . It 's their latest single , recorded before they went off to meditate in India last month , and released on both sides of the Atlantic last week . It bears the hallmarks of all their most recent work : a deft arrangement , superb engineering , and a lyric ( sung by Paul McCartney in what is known as his " Elvis voice " ) that combines blithe humor with sharp social portraiture of a hard-pressed mother : <P> Tuesday afternoon is neverending ; <P> Wednesday morning papers did n't come . <P> Thursday night your stockings needed mending : <P> See how they run . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realms that the Beatles charted in such songs as Strawberry Fields Forever and A Day in the Life , the record glances backward to the simple , hard-driving style they left behind in Liverpool . There are no electronic rumbles , no shifting keys or tempos-just a bluesy melodic line plunging exuberantly over an instrumental backing that is straight out of an old-fashioned record-hop . <P> That happens to be the direction in which much of the British pop scene is looking nowadays . With their characteristic knack for crystallizing what is in the air , the Beatles have captured the current upsurge of interest in " oldfashioned " rock ' n ' roll in Britain . Elvis Presley is back on the charts there with Guitar Man , and his earlier hits like Blue Suede Shoes are going for as much as $4 on the second-hand record market . When Bill Haley and his Comets arrive in England next month for a tour , they will find that their epoch-making 1950s ' recordings of Rock Around the Clock and Shake , Rattle and Roll have been reissued to meet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names like Tommy Bishop and the Rock ' n ' Roll Revival Show , and trade journals are eagerly asking : Is the old rock coming back ? <P> Instant Oldies . The answer , of course , is that it had never really gone , neither in Britain nor in the U.S. It may have been overshadowed in the past few years by a wave of such experimental groups as the Jefferson Airplane , The Doors and The Cream , not to mention the Beatles . But , as Chicago Disk Jockey Jim Stagg says , " basic rock , straight rock , has always been around and part of the top ten . " <P> As far as record companies are concerned , smash hits never die , they just get re-released in albums as part of an " oldies " series . Radio stations , courting the lucrative advertising market of 18-to 34-year-olds who grew up on rock ' n ' roll , carefully balance their play list of new releases with selected classics of the genre ( examples : the Platters ' The Great Pretender , Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bye Bye Love ) . New York 's WOR-FM ( " The Sound of Solid Gold " ) is one of six RKO General radio stations across the country on which the proportion of oldies is as high as 50% . <P>
