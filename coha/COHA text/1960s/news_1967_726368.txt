txt State Supreme Court Justice Saul S. Streit , at the request of the city , last night signed an order temporarily restraining the owners of . rent-controlled buildings here from conspiring to deny " all essential services " to tenants . The order was signed after the city had charged in an affidavit that the landlords had conspired " to create a health emergency in order to coerce the City of New York to repeal or amend the Residential Rent Control Law . " Justice Streit signed the order in his apartment at 480 Park Avenue shortly after 7 P.M. Lawyers in the city Corporation Counsel 's office spent the day at the Mayor 's request preparing the order and the supporting affidavit . Directed* at Landlords The order is aimed It the owners of about 1,000 rent-controlled buildings in Manhattan , who were struck on May 26 by Local 32B of the Building Serv-. ice Employes International Union . Since that , date , ' most of the landlords have either reduced or eliminated such services as garbage disposal , hot , water and elevator service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands un-I til the rent control law is , changed to allow for higher rents . The order lists as specific defendants the Metropolitan Fair Rent Committee and its president , Edward Sulzberger , and the Community Housing Improvement Program , and its president , Leon Katz . The two organizations represent landlords . Other owners or man // agers of rent-controlled properties are covered by the order automatically . Mr. Sulzberger Issued a statement last night on behalf of his committee that said : " This action will not shorten the strike . Regrettably it may have the opposite effect . At a time when we are working with city officials in good faith to end this tragic impasse , the city has chosen to obtain a preliminary injunction against us . It is not an act calculated to brii , new light and new reason to the dialogue . " Counsel advises us on the basis of preliminary press description that the order is without merit . It is true that a failure to provide services has created a health hazard . The failure is that of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to cross picket lines to pick up mounting piles of ? garbaev . That health emerdeclared today , the city 's emgency could  --  and should  --  have been called four days ago . " We still seek a reasonable solution to this problem . Today 's action does not make our search easier . " Hearing Planned Monday The defendants are required to appear in State Supreme Court on Monday at 9:30 A.M. before Justice Nathaniel T. Heiman to show why the temporary order should not be made permanent . The order , in addition to disallowing any conspiracy to deny services , also requires that the defendants not conspire to prevent or in any way inter , fere with access or deliveries to any building . At the same time the landlords are restrained from conspiring to refuse or fail to comply with any provision of the New York City Charter , the Administrative Code , the Health Code , the Multiple Dwelling Law or any regulation providing for the health and safety of tenants . The supporting affidavit was signed by Maurice A. Reichman , chief counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , it said : " The unanimity of owners , landlords and managing agents of rent-controlled properties , coupled with the absurd assertion that all are equally impoverished , but that repeal of rent control will cure all of their monetary ills , lead to the conclusion that there exists amon them a common scheme to thwart the public policy of continuing rent control by their illegal actions . " The affidavit noted the accumulation of garbage and refuse inside the struck buildings " presents an ever increasing danger to the health and safety of the community . " Earlier yesterday , the Mayor declared a health emergency in Manhattan , and grateful tenants stood outside their buildings and watched sanitationmen cross picket lines to remove piles of garbage on the streets . The crews received special orders from the Health Department before going out on their 7 A.M. shift . The orders enabled them to cross the picket lines . Sanitation Commissioner Samuel J. Kearing Jr . said that the crews had met no opposition from the pickets and predicted that by working overtime his men " would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8200,000 to cover the overtime . The Commissioner said in an interview that there was still a fire and health hazard in many buildings because tenants had not brought the garbage out from basements and halls . Union Problem Cited He said that the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association had always opposed sending men into the building to pick up garbage . Therefore , he urged te : ? . nts to bring garbage out of the building to avoid " a volatile union situation . " John De Lury , president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association said in an interview that his members would cooperate during the emergency but that " we will not go beyond the building line . We have enough of a job picking it up from the curbstone . " Earlier , Mr. Kearing toured the West Side with the Mayor . Looking at a pile of garbage in front of 118 Riverside Drive , near the corner of 84th Street , Mr. Lindsay said : " You see , there was indeed justification for declaring a health emergency . " The Mayor ended his tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sanitation trucks would soon remove the trash in front of their building . About 1,200 men worked overtime for two hours in Manhattan to clear up an eightday accumulation at some buildings . They were instructed to give priority to buildings ; on strike . Some of the crews became ' discouraged . As they removed one pile and moved down the street , tenants came out of their buildings and refilled the empty cans . Police and Firemen Help The Police Department set up a special bureau to tell sanitation crews where emergency conditions existed and the Fire Department sent out engine companies to check whether basements and hallways had been cleared . Capt . Clifford Goldstein of the Fire Department , who was out on " garbage patrol " with a crew from Ladder Company 25 , 205 West 77th Street , said that there was little danger of spontaneous combustion from garbage stored in cellars . " But if the warm temperatures continue , " he warned , " it will become a serious health hazard . " " It has to come out of the cellars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven , which contains the highest number of buildings involved in the strike . The district runs from 72d Street to 110th Street between Riverside Drive and Central Park West . Mr. Rocco said that his 59 men and 19 trucks had already removed the greater part of the garbage on the sidewalks " but most of it is still in the buildings . " Warren Hill , a sanitationman who was clearing what he described as " a monstrosity " at 98 West 82d Street , estimated that " about three-fourths was still in the cellars . " Mr. Hill and his two partners were attacking a pile of 60 cans and paper bags about six feet high and 20 feet wide . The bags had been brought out by tenants the night before . It took an . hour to clean up the pile . Mrs. Frances Doyle and William Mishkin , who live in I the building , both said they ; were " overjoyed . " " We do n't mind bringing it I I the garbage I clown . " Mrs.I Doyle added " but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; else . " Abigail Kellogg , who was ; running one of the elevators ' inside , said : " We would have ; put the garbage in the street ; tonight if the emergency was ' not declared . " Many tenants on the West ; Side had dumped garbage in , the streets Thursday night in an effort to have it picked up . After the crew finished , Mr. Hill sat down and said , " We 're tired as mules . " He said that earlier a rat had ? jumped out of a can he had picked up on 84th Street . " There really is a health hazard , I 've never seen accumulation so great , " , he said . By afternoon most of the big piles in front of buildings from 84th Street to 72d Street had been removed . But at 67 Riverside Drive , where tenants had made no effort to move the garbage into the street . a long row of cans filled the courtyard . Eugene Raskin , who lives in the building next door at 316 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the garbage since the strike began , said removal of garbage depended on how well the tenants were organized . " We 've been fighting the landlord for two years , " he said , " as a result everybody knew each other . We ' can easily get together on such problems as garbage and running the elevators.
