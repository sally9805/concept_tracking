During the long , tortuous nuclear-test-ban wrangle between the U.S. and Russia , it often seemed that neither side really expected a test ban , that the wall of suspicion between the two nations was unbreachable . But two weeks ago , the world caught a glint of something that hinted at Russian willingness to negotiate . At the U.S.-British-Soviet test-ban conference in Geneva , Russian Delegate Semyon K. <P> Tsarapkin made what seemed to be a significant concession . <P> In a departure from Russia 's longtime insistence that a nuclear test ban must start with a flat ban on all tests , detectable or not , Tsarapkin agreed to accept the U.S. 's distinction between 1 ) detectable tests , which the U.S. is willing to ban if an adequate detection system is worked out , and 2 ) smaller underground tests , which the U.S. is not willing to include in the treaty ban because at present there is no known practical way of detecting them ( see box next page ) . Said Tsarapkin : Russia will agree to a treaty banning only tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to a " voluntary " moratorium on subthreshold tests while experts work out better detection techniques . <P> Through the Haze . At the President 's Camp David mountain retreat in Maryland last week , Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and President Eisenhower discussed the Soviet proposal over the course of two days , agreed on a joint statement accepting a " voluntary moratorium " on below-threshold tests-provided that Russia enter into a treaty banning detectable tests under an adequate inspection system , and agree to a " coordinated research program " for improving detection techniques . <P> Even before Macmillan 's plane left London , the Administration had decided in its own councils to accept Tsarapkin 's moratorium proposal in the interest of getting a test-ban treaty that might possibly lead to progress on disarmament . <P> Cutting through the haze of passion that has often obscured the facts on both sides of the test-ban debate , the Administration had arrived at the conclusion that 1 ) a test-ban treaty would be well worth while if it made possible eventual progress toward controlled disarmament ; and 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test ban , and-most important-could not gain any really decisive advantage even if it did cheat . <P> In the sessions that hammered out the decision to accept the Soviet moratorium proposal , Air Force Secretary James Douglas , sitting in for traveling Defense Secretary Thomas Gates , made it clear that the Pentagon , to a surprising extent , had come around to a conviction that the chance for an inspection agreement outweighed the risks and costs of a test ban . <P> Central Intelligence Agency Chief Allen Dulles reported that the CIA had no evidence that Russia had ever shown any interest in testing to develop tactical nuclear weapons . Any break in Russia 's wall of suspicion and secrecy , he added , would be to the U.S. 's interests . Atomic Energy Commission Chairman John McCone , arguing that the U.S. needs underground tests to develop tactical nuclear weapons , found himself almost alone in the Administration 's top councils , and at the end the President ruled against him .                 @ @ @ @
