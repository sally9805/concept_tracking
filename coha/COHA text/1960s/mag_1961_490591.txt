Notes and Comment E have our own method of telling when spring is in the air , and we pass it along for whatever encouragement it may give to others . One moment we arc at our desk , glancing at the wall hook where our heavy winter overcoat hangs , an itchy wool muffler draped over one of its shoulders . Our umbrella hangs on the next wintry hook ; beside it there 's our drab , heavy gray felt hat . Beneath the hooks , at the base of a small cabinet , lies our emergency pair of galoshes , hideous objects whose name implies black slush rather than bright snow . There are aspirin bottles inside the cabinet . Our sinuses are engaged in some private and obnoxious festival to which nobody else would care to be invited . Our outlook , in short , is bleak , not to say wintry . And the next moment we suddenly hear the hoot from the North River  --  the full-throated , defiant , independent hoot of a liner that is setting out to sea . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoot comes right through our window , jiggles our umbrella , topples the aspirin hottles , and breaks up the sinuses ' party . We know , because we have just heard the hoot , and it is unmistakably the first hoot of spring , and filled  --  again , again  --  with promise . Let There Be Light THERE arc no bats in the belfry of the First Presbyterian Church , a Gothic pile down at Fifth Avenue and Twelfth Street , This we established by accompanying Edgar Tafel , an architect quite prominent in the ecclesiastical line , and Alexander Robertson , the sexton of the First Presbyterian , on a tour of the attic of the edifice one morning last week . The purpose of the tour was to examine the possibility of casting more light into the church from the apexes of the Gothic bays than is provided by the four chandeliers that are now the principal source of illumination . As we toiled upward to the summit , each step a little more arduous than the last , Mr. Tafel , a jolly soul in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the chandeliers whose function he was out to augment had come from the Madison Square Presbyterian Church , where the Reverend Charles H. Parkhurst , foe of the denizens of the Tenderloin , waxed and waned , and that they had been installed seventy-odd years after the present building  --  which , incidentally , cost fifty-five thousand dollars  --  was dedicated , in 1846 . Gasping along behind Mr. Tafel and the equally agile Mr. Robertson , who carried a flashlight , we presently left the secure stairway that had been supporting us and entered a door that led to the attic proper . " What you might call this , " said Mr. Tafel , " is Lon Chaneyville . I 'll bet he 'd rather be a phantom here than at the opera . " " Watch your head , " said Mr. Robertson , and we proceeded through a small door into a wilderness of beams crisscrossing endlessly over the gray parabolas , like the humps of camels , created by the tops of the bays . A couple of naked electric bulbs and Mr. Robertson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way along a series of wooden catwalks . All of us had to crouch to avoid being decapitated by an intricate stateture that angled out over the catwalks , but Mr. Tafel , even when practically doubled up , continued to inform us about what we were looking at , or trying to look at . " When Gothic was first introduced into the United States , vaulting bays were made of plaster , just as these are , and hung from the rafters , " he said . " You 'll notice how the beams take care of the various stresses , and you 'll notice , too , that the wood is as sound now as it was a century ago . Today , if we were building these hays , we would , of course , use steel-strap hangers , but this is solid stuff . " He rapped a timber appreciatively , and took off on a catwalk leading to the left . " We are now over the center of the church , " Mr. Tafel continued , " and there is , thank God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light up . The hole goes through one of those five-font plaster rosettes that you see at the apexes of the hays , and we can lower spotlights through this and one other , and have our problem solved without fuss or muss . The plaster is too light to support a man for any length of time , but with these catwalks the workmen should n't have too much difficulty . " Mr. Robertson peered around and remarked , " Could n't one of those artistic photographers have a ball with all the shadows up here ? " Since Mr. Tafel seemed to have completed his mission , we proposed , on the ground of a slight attack of claustrophobia , that we leave the upper reaches of the First Presbyterian  --  a notion that was agreeable to our companions . Once we were outside the small door again , Mr. Robertson showed us the echo chamber of the organ , in an area just beyond . " You hear that hum he said . " We got a cipher . That 's an air leak . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belfry  --  or at least to the base of it . " Nobody rings the bell , " he said . " Dr. Mellin once told the congregation that people around here like to sleep late . " We went down to the main floor of the church , and accompanied Mr. Tafel to the adjoining church house . In an office in the church house , we met Dr. John O. 1VIellin and his associate , John Macnab , the first very tall and young , the second not so tall but equally young . Mr. Macnah immediately complained to Mr. Tafel that he had been all set to climb up to the attic , and had put his worst suit on in preparation for the trip . Mr. Tafel apologized for depriving him of the exercise . " This church is full of surprises , " said Dr. Mellin . " Right now , we 've got the market cornered on authentic eighteenth-century tombstones . When the church was moved here hack in 1846 , from down in the Wall Street section , several bodies came with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have down in the basement . The reason those large rosettes at the tops of the bays have holes in them is that at Christmastime in the twenties the church used to be festooned with great loops of laurel . That sort of thing does n't go on now , but I think the church will survive . I have a notion that the Protestants arc becoming a prophetic minority , which is what the Presbyterians were in the first place , and I think they can get along without the trimmings . Right now , I 'd like to think of something to do with those tombstones . I do n't believe in collecting , and I do n't like antiques that are n't practical . " " Am I glad those rosettes have holes in them ! " said Mr. Tafel . ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE ( DIVISION OF IMPLAUSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS ) : There 's a Lamb and Rabbit Workers Union , Local 85 , at 109 West Twenty-sixth Street . Six-Sided THE winter we 're just about to say TH to has been the sixth-snowiest en record hereabouts-52.7 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1892-93 , 56.1 in 1893-94 , 58.3 in 1898-99 , 53 in 1933-34 , and 61.5 in 1947-48 ? hut this is only early March , and you notice that we say " so far . " In any case , while walking deep in snow , shovelling snow , and merely sitting and watching it swirl down past our windows , we 've gone from welcoming it to tolerating it to being irritated by it , and finally to pronouncing a harsh druid curse on the stuff . This sequence of emotions has had one fruitful result  --  we 've been sufficiently preoccupied with snow to learn a little about what it is , why it is , and where it 's apt to be found ( on the equator , among other unexpected places ) . The formation of snow depends chiefly on a cloud temperature no higher than 10 ' Fahrenheit and a substantial amount of water vapor in the air . It is not true that more snow falls at the poles than anywhere else on earth . A greater amount of snow forms in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does in the extremely low temperatures of the Arctic and Antarctic . Snow may he formed under favorable conditions in the upper atmosphere but turn into rain on the war down , depending on the temperature close to the earth 's surface . One day last week , quite an angry little snowstorm hit lower Westchester but there was simply cold rain in town , New York being , in effect , steam-heated outdoors as well as in , and therefore nearly always a few degrees warmer than the suburbs . A rough rule of thumb employed by meteorologists is that ten inches of snow is the equivalent of an inch of rain . The heaviest snowfalls occur at temperatures between 24 ' and 30 ? . The heaviest local snowfall on record was the Big Snow of 1947 , which piled up 25.8 inches in less than twenty-four hours , but the most talked-about was , of course , the Blizzard of ' 88 , which piled up a total of 20.9 inches in sixty-two hours and was accompanied by gale winds , causing the snow to form twenty-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to have taken place in Silver Lake , Colorado , in 1 9 2 1 ? a hundred inch es in eighty-five hours . Since snow is a function of cold , and cold is a function of height above sea level , among other things , plenty of places in the Torrid Zones get snow . At the equator , it takes a mountain at least seventeen thousand feet high  --  Mount Kenya , for example  --  to hear snow all year round , whereas up in Alaska mountains only five thousand feet high are permanently capped with snow . The Empire State Building would have to be eight times as high as it is to be permanently snow-capped at this latitude . The development of snowflakes is ordinarily dependent on the presence in the air of microscopic nuclei , the composition of which is , surprisingly , uncertain ; comparatively high temperature and low atmospheric pressure combine at low altitudes to produce large , moist flakes , while the formation of tiny , compact flakes requires high altitudes , high pressure , and low temperature There arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The former includes those lacy hexagonal plates and complex star shapes that one often sees in photographic enlargements . Hexagonal structure is characteristic of practically all snowflakes ; a few , though , are triangular , and now and again you may run across a crazy mixed-up four- or five-sided snowflake . Nobody is sure why snowflakes are six-sided , but it 's agreed that the tripartite composition of the water molecule has something to do with it . Our word " snow " comes from the Old English " sneiw . " Snow is " neige " in French , " neve " in Italian , and " sieve " in Spanish . The State of Nevada was named for the Sierra Nevada , or " snowy mountain range , " which lies partly within its boundaries . The French Revolutionary calendar , which was adopted in 1793 and abandoned a few years later , included a month called NivOse , or Snow , which lasted from December 21st to January 19th , when Pluviiise , or Rain , hopefully succeeded it . Almost anything white tends to get named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a metaphor for purity it has proved unbeatable for over two thousand years . The Psalms say , " Wash rne , and I shall be whiter than snow , " and Isaiah says , " Though your sins he as scarlet , they shall he as white as snow . " Swinhurne , who would do practically anything for the sake of alliteration , tried to smear snow with " For winter 's rains and ruins are over , And all the season of snows and sins , " and current slang makes snow a synonym for both heroin and overwhelming flattery , but for the most part snow en joys an excellent press . What else can you imagine the fleece of Mary 's little lamb being said to be as white as ? ?

Prince Sadruddin is twenty-eight , just under six feet tall , and wonderfully well tailored , and has the famous dark-brown Khan eyes .

" The Prince graduated from Harvard in the class of 1954 , then spent three years there doing graduate work in Persian history and Arabic . It was while he was still an undergraduate that he assumed the role of publisher , under circumstances less characteristic of him than of his publication , the Paris Rc7. ' ; e14 ) . A literary periodical that has offices in Paris , London , and Flushing , the Review comes out several times a year , but rarely at the same times from one year to the next .

I started in by bailing the editors out of a printer 's debt of three or four hundred dollars and have been on the job ever since .

Later in the summer , I started work for Unesco on an extraordinary project to save the Nubian monuments on the Upper Nile from being drowned . Upward from Aswan , where the new High Dam is under construction , there are sixteen freestanding temples , built in the days of the Pharaohs , and seven hewn out of cliffs . When the water rises behind the dam , these priceless relics will be lost to mankind forever unless , at enormous expense , we move the movable ones . Who is to pay for all thisr I spoke to President Nasser , and he is both much interested and very much concerned , but the United Arab Republic can not possibly finance , singlehanded , the salvation of its monuments . So on I shall go , in a race with the water , to many countries , helping to raise the unthinkable sums needed to achieve our goal .

Life in the Waldorf WE were getting along perfectly happily in what seemed to us at least an interesting world until Joseph E. Seagram &; Sons , a firm dealing in booze , began to stir us up . " Man until now has been confined to one little planet surrounded by an atmosphere 100 miles high , and , like a fish at the bottom of the 100-mile-deep ocean , unable to see what goes on above the surface , " it wrote , a trifle awkwardly , in an invitation to a " Life in Other Worlds " Luncheon and Symposium held in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf last week , and went on : The coming of the space age enables man to rise above the confining atmosphere to see the universe around him in its pristine glory . In man 's ability to escape the gravitational bonds that have held him to earth lies the opportunity to answer age-old fundamental questions ; How did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as a billion years ago ? Does Life exist elsewhere and what is the form of that life ? We may expect answers to begin coming in the lifetime of most human beings living today . One of the most enticing prom-ises that the conquest of outer space holds is the possibility of communicating with intelligent beings in other worlds .... It is our hope that these outstanding men who are graciously giving their time to this Symposium may provide us with insight to what lies ahead in this world and in other worlds . We 're busy enough , as it happens , communicating with intelligent beings at the water cooler in our office , but we gravitated over to the Waldorf anyway , surfacing at noon in the east lounge of the ballroom , where drinks were being served . There we began to examine such life as the confining atmosphere afforded . The first distinguished piece of protoplasm to swim into our ken was Mr. Robert Cecil , chief of the British Information Services . " We had Toynbee for dinner last night , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Arnold J. Toynhee , the British historian , who was one of the Symposium 's " outstanding men . " The oth ers , we had noted in our invitation , included Dr. G. B. Kistiakowsky , professor of chemistry at Harvard ; Dr Donald N. Michael , senior staff social psychologist at Brookings Institution ; Dr. Harlow Shapley , the Harvard astronomer ; and Dr. Otto Struve , director of the National Radio Astronomy , Observatory . We next turned to Mr. Carl H. Pforzheimer , Jr. , an investment banker , and asked what had persuaded him to escape the gravitational bonds of Broad Street . " The Bronfmans are our neighbors in Purchase , " he said , referring to Seagram 's owners , " and I 'm interested in education ; I 'm on the Board of Regents . " Mr. Pforzheimer introduced us to Mr. Horace C. Flanigan , chairman of the hoard of the Manufacturers Trust Company , who said , " You know why I 'm here , " and moved on , laughing .

No one joined us . Alone in a sea of lunchers , we were halfway through our Avocado Pear Waldorf when a tall , genial man sat down next to us and introduced himself as William T. Far-icy , retired president of the Association of American Railroads . " Eric Johnston and I flew in from Washington with General T. A McInerney , " he said . " I give the Association a little gratuitous advice from time to time . Without pay , that is . " He pulled a press kit out from under him and gazed at it uncertainly . " Good grief , I 'm at the wrong table ! " he said . " I 'm supposed to he at Twenty . " And off he went , his Avocado Pear untouched .

To the accompaniment of organ music , we ate our Grilled Filet Mignon ( advertised on the menu as flanked by Asparagus Polonaise , but supported in fact by String Beans ) and , as Mr. Janoff was joined by another journalist , table-hopped to Table 29 , where we had spied a vacant space next to a couple of enticing young ladies . These proved to be Nancy Frazier , of Newsweek 's Space and the Atom department , and Antoinette Gattozzi , of its Science department . " Is n't this organ music awful ? " one of them said " It 's too loud , and anyway this is not a skating rink . " On the stroke of one-thirty , the curtains of the ballroom stage parted , providing us with a sight of Mr. Edgar M.

After observ'ng that the Symposium was being held under the auspices of the Samuel Bronfman Foundation , established by Seagram &; Sons " to further goals of aiding mankind the world over , " Mr. B. presented his father , Mr. Samuel B. , founder and president of Distillers Corporation-Seagrams , Ltd . " Man has not learned yet to live peaceably with his neighbors , " the Founder said . " Annihilation could be but a step away . But also a step away are the stars . " This was Dr. Killian 's cue to introduce the speakers . Dr. Kistiakowsky said that life on other planets was probably primitive and microscopic . Dr. Michael said that the first contact between the earth and other planets might well make religious leaders and scientists anxious , and he suggested that extra-terrestrials might not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Venus as uninhabitable . Dr. Struve said that there might possibly be intelligent living beings on many of the billions of planets but we were probably the only such in our solar system . Dr. Tuynhee found this thought comforting . " We will not he visited by superior groups who might do to us what the Old World did to the New , " he said . " Could we learn spiritually from outer space ? " Mr. Laurence asked . Dr. Shapley replied that it would take at least twenty-four years , and in most cases a whole lot longer , to get an answer to any question directed by radio signal to a planet beyond our solar system . " Our great-grandchildren might get the answers , " 1 ) i . Toy ' bee said . If we permitted them to be alive . " Our hope of good extra-terrestrial talk somewhat dampened , we beat it back to the water cooler .
