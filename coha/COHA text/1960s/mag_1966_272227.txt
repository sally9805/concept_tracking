THE MERCHANT BANKERS by Joseph Wechsberg. 365 pages . Little , Brown . $6.95 . <P> London 's dynastic Hambro family , the world 's biggest merchant bankers , started their moneymaking art two centuries ago , when a Hambro sea captain got word that the Queen of Denmark had died in Paris ; he promptly cornered the market for crape in Copenhagen . Britain 's Baring banking clan made a great leap forward by arranging an $11,250,000 bond issue for Thomas Jefferson 's Louisiana Purchase . The Rothschilds of Paris and London grew to prominence by smuggling millions in gold through Napoleon 's line to Wellington 's forces in Spain . Such are the foundations of the fortunes of the most prosperous and least known of all businessmen , the merchant bankers . <P> In this series of essays , New Yorker Correspondent Joseph Wechsberg examines seven of the world 's leading merchant or investment bankers . Though he is himself the son and grandson of bankers , Wechsberg ignores a lot of the basics of the business and , with the exception of a chapter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers to concentrate on those of London 's City . But his stories have a richness of color and some details of remarkable deals that have turned money into factories , jobs and useful products for everybody 's compound interest . <P> Big Funds , Long Terms . Unlike commercial bankers , who take deposits and specialize in short-term loans , modern merchant bankers are intermediaries between those who have big money to invest and those who need it , often for long terms . They finance entrepreneurs and foreign governments by selling bonds or other securities to the public or to such wealthy institutional investors as insurance companies , pension funds , and even the Church of England . <P> The merchant banker 's prime asset is his experience in sizing up situations , measuring men and calculating risks down to one sixty-fourth of 1 % . But very often , as Wechsberg notes , he relies on instinct . One day in 1932 , Swedish Match King Ivar Kreuger tried to interest the Lehman Brothers in a complicated financial deal . Kreuger talked and talked about his grandiose schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lehman turned him down : " I have a rule , Mr. Kreuger . If I can not understand something by reading my notes on the subject , I wo n't buy it . You are too complex for me , Mr. Kreuger . " A few months later , as his swindles collapsed around him , Kreuger shot himself . <P> Courage is as common as caution . Working behind the scenes during World War II , Hambros Chairman Jack Hambro helped harass the German economy through black market operations in Nazi-occupied countries . Sometimes the rewards of courage are handsome . When California 's Jergins Corp . was up for sale in 1950 , nobody wanted to buy it-nobody but Lehman Brothers , which formed a group that picked up the company for $29 million , renamed it Monterey Oil . Within two years , the Lehman group paid off the full amount by selling some of the company 's assets , yet still kept most of the property . The Lehman men built up that property and in 1960 sold it to Humble Oil for $119 million-all profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
