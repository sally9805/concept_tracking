Advanced nations tend to rely more and more on activist government to enlarge their citizens ' wellbeing . But the more government does for people the bigger government gets-and the smaller citizens feel . What champion can fight city hall , slash red tape and rescue the Little Guy from the insolence of Big Bureaucracy ? <P> As far back as 1809 , Sweden invented just such a " people 's watchdog " and gave him a name , ombudsman , which means representative . Sweden 's current ombudsman , Alfred Bexelius , 63 , is a unique national mediator who serves the public by prodding laggard civil servants . He and his ten assistants already have counterparts in Denmark , Finland , Norway and New Zealand . Britain recently joined the movement by appointing a " parliamentary commission , " and agitation for the appointment of ombudsmen has suddenly become popular all over the U.S. So far , however , the word does not even appear in U.S. dictionaries . <P> <P> The power of an ombudsman varies from country to country , but all have common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints against government officials at little or no charge . Although they are instruments of the legislature , they are only generally answerable to it , and have no links with the executive . Their access to official papers is virtually unlimited , permitting them thorough review of administrative actions . One result is that they defend officials as well as citizens and knowledgeably dismiss most complaints as unfounded . Though all seek justice for individuals , their overriding goal is better administration . <P> <P> Clogged Channels . The strongest argument for American ombudsmen comes from Columbia Law Professor Walter Gellhorn , top U.S. scholar on the subject . Last week Harvard University Press published two Gellhorn books , one a survey of " citizens ' protectors " in nine countries , Ombudsmen and Others ( $6.95 ) , the other a U.S. study , When Americans Complain ( $3.95 ) . Although the U.S. is rich in responsive administrators and procedural safeguards against official abuse , says Gellhorn , the country 's channels of complaint are so clogged that citizens either get no hearing or win isolated victories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. skeptics argue that , in effect , all U.S. Congressmen and state legislators are already ombudsmen . Not so , says Gellhorn . To be sure , Congress receives 100,000 letters a day , a vast percentage of them constituents ' requests for anything from Fort Knox gold bricks to intercession with regulatory agencies . Unfortunately , says Gellhorn , the episodic results merely assure individual votes rather than broad reforms . Worse , most state legislators can not even help their constituents . Thirty state legislatures meet only biennially , and newcomers fill half the seats at each session ; only eleven states pay legislators more than $5,000 a year , and funds for adequate staff work are rarely provided . As a result , most citizens ' complaints are simply passed on to the official concerned , who may well ignore them .
