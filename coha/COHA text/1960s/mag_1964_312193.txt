Intended by Italy 's constitution makers to be a merely ceremonial office , the presidency of Italy has actually turned out to be an important steady ing influence during times of confusion in Italian politics . Hence , when President Antonio Segni was felled by a cerebral stroke last August , Italians were concerned not only for the frail , oft-ailing Segni , whom they had long affectionately called malato di ferro - " the iron invalid " - but for their nation as well . <P> The iron invalid bounced back again , by last week was able to speak halt ingly , write with his left hand . But it seemed unlikely that he could ever resume the full duties of President , and the scramble was on for the succession with no clear winner in sight . Among the most likely : former Christian Dem crat Premier and center-left architect Amintore Fanfani ; Foreign Minister Giuseppe Saragat , a Social Democrat strongly in favor of European unity ; former Foreign Minister Attilio Piccioni , now national president of the Christian Democrats .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
