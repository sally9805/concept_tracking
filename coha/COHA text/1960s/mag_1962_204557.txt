When it gets around to voting this week on a " new " medicare bill , the Senate will not have to gaze very hard to spy the familiar figure of a controversial companion . <P> Under attack by medical lobbies and opposed by most Republican and many Democratic Senators , the Kennedy Administration 's King-Anderson bill to provide hospital care for the aged under social security has disappeared from view . In its place last week appeared a bipartisan compromise disguised in the legislative equivalent of a newly donned jacket and a different style of hairsplitting . But though the disguise failed to alarm King-Anderson 's friends , it also failed to fool its opponents-even if the clothes were a bit more conservative . <P> The substitute bill provides for exactly the same benefits as King-Anderson : up to 90 days of hospital care for one illness , up to 180 days of nursing home services , and up to 240 home visits by medical personnel other than M.D.s . As in King-Anderson , the patient would still have to meet his own doctor bills . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as King-Anderson , too : through an increase of one-quarter of 1% in the social security tax , plus a like levy on the employer . <P> But the new bill has two additional provisions to distinguish it from King-Anderson . It provides for identical benefits for persons 65 and over who would not be eligible for social security coverage ; these benefits would be financed out of the annual general revenues of the Federal Government . The new bill also , to soften conservative opposition , provides an option recommended by New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller : a social security beneficiary would have a choice between accepting the Government benefits or having the Government contribute toward the premium on a private health insurance plan providing equal benefits-but only if the beneficiary had been enrolled in such a private plan for a specified period before becoming eligible for social security . <P> At his press conference . President Kennedy put in a special plug for the touched-up measure , called it " a strong bill , an effective bill . " But most Senators who had originally been opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may scratch through the Senate . After that , its prospects in the House , congressional leaders calculated , were about the same as King-Anderson 's had been : pretty bad .
