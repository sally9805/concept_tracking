I hope succeeding generations will be able to be idle . I hope that nine-tenths of their time will be leisure time ; that they may enjoy their days , and the earth , and the beauty of this beautiful world ; that they may rest by the sea and dream ; that they may dance and sing , eat and drink . <P> - Novelist Richard Jefferies ( 1848-1887 ) <P> From John Stuart Mill to John Maynard Keynes , economists , as well as authors and politicians , have cherished such a Utopian vision of the abundant life . The millennium , it was always assumed , would arrive when full employment combined with high productivity to supply mankind with everything it needed , as well as the leisure time to enjoy it . If any problem existed , it would be finding enough to do . But things are not working out that way . So , at least , argues Staffan Burenstam Linder , 38 , a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics who has taught at Yale and Columbia . He states his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already ruffled Swedish composure , and will be published in English this December by the Columbia University Press . " I find it paradoxical , " says its author , " that as income rises , we are all running like hell . " <P> Linder 's socio-economic put-down is based on the assumption that the rarest element on earth is time . Time can not be stored or saved , or consumed at a rate faster than it is produced . The rich man has no more of it than the pauper-and no less . Previous economic theory , says Linder , fails to take into sufficient account that leisure time must be consumed , either by doing something or doing nothing . For a society both af fluent and leisured , and anxious to put every moment to good use , there are simply too many things to do . Overwhelmed by a burgeoning store of goods and services designed for pleasure , the would-be consumer , trying to do everything at once , succumbs to a malady that Linder calls " pleasure blindness . " <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " that cow milks me . " Linder argues that the same holds true of the commodity time , and that as one result , people become slaves of the possessions and services that compete to fill their leisure hours . " One may possibly buy more of everything , " he writes , " but one can not conceivably do more of everything . " To belong to a golf club as well as a sailing club is to spend half one 's time going from one to the other , the other half observing all the social amenities that they entail . <P> The arguments that Linder offers are gently satirical . A mischievous streak rises irrepressibly in his book . Some of his more trenchant diagnoses : <P> ON BEING ON TIME : Punctuality has become a virtue that we demand of those around us . Waiting is a squandering of time that angers people in rich countries . Only personal mismanagement , or the inconsiderate behavior of others , will create brief-and highly irritating-periods of involuntary idleness . <P> ON EATING : Actual cooking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heating , which is not an unqualified advance . Since there is a limit-for most people a fairly low one-to how far the pleasures of sitting at table can be enhanced by increasing the amount and quality of the food , it is probable that eating will become an inferior pursuit .
