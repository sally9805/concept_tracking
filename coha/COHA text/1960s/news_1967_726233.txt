txt WASHINGTON , April 2 ? A Presidential advisory group has recommended major changes in the controversial campaign financing law that Congress enacted last fall . The White House , however , does not intend to propose any modification while Congress is debating a move by Senator Albert Gore , Dcmocrat of Tennessee , to repeal the statute . The Senate is expected to vote this week on the Gore proposal , with the outcome in doubt . Senator Gore has served notice that he will use a highpriority Administration bill , which would restore tax benefits for business investment in equipment and buildings , as a springboard for his move . He will offer an amendment to that bill for the repeal of the campaign financing law . The tax bill will be the first business to be taken up in the Senate after Congress returns tomorrow from a 10-day Ester recess . As the new law now stands , individual income taxpayers will have the opportunity , starting in 1968 , to check a box in their final returns if they want $1 of their taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30-million could be paid from the fund to each of the major political parties for // the Presidential campaign of 1968 . In an unpublicized report submitted President Johnson last December , an advisory group headed by Prof. Richard E. Neustadt of Harvard University strongly endorsed the principle of using public funds to help finance political campaigns . However , according to sources who have seen the report , the panel suggested the abandonment of the tax checkoff on the ground that it was superfluous and unnecessarily controversial . The group was said to favor revision of the law to authorize the appropriation of general tax revenues for Presidential campaign expenses without requiring prior allocations by taxpayers . Other amendments recommended by the group would liberalize provisions authorizing minor parties to get a share of the Presidential campaign fund and establish standards for the expenditure of allocations from the fund and of contributions from private sources . Details Withheld The White House declined to say whether the Neustadt report would be made public or whether President Johnson would submit such recommendations to Congress . Presidential aides and Professor Neustadt also declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose its recommendations . The tax checkoff plan , devised by Senator Russell B. Long , Democrat of Lousiana , was enacted shortly before Congress adjourned last October as an extraneous amendment to a tax revision bill that was designed to encourage foreign investment in the United States . It was endorsed by President Johnson when he signed the bill Nov. 13 . He said then that he was asking a bipartisan group of " our best political scientists and experts . " headed by Professor Neustadt. " to see how the promise of the new Presidential campaign fund law can be fully realized . " Under the new law . major political parties are entitled to equal shares of the checkoff fund to cover certified Presidential campaign expenses every four years . The amount authorized for distribution to major parties , defined as those polling more than 15 million votes in the most recent election , is based on the combined vote cast in that election for their Presidential candidates . For each vote above 10 million , $1 is allocated for division in equal shares to the major parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast in 1964 for the Democratic and Repubican candidates . Thus , up to $60-million would be available to the two major parties in 1968 . If a minor party polled as many as five million votes in a Presidential election , it would be eligible for a smaller share of the fund four years later . It could draw $1 for each vote over five million polled by its candidate . No minor party has polled five million votes in the last 40 years . The Neustadt group suggested that a minor party should be reimbursed for expenses in the same year that it polled more than five million votes rather than being required to wait four years for a share of the fund . Senator Long has drafted a similar amendment . The Neustadt group disagreed with proposals by Senator Long and others for the prohibition or sharp limitation of private contributions to Presidential campaigns . Instead , it recommended statutory standards for the expenditure of public and private funds by the political parties . The public funds could be used under these standards only for activities related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain types of newspaper and magazine advertisements and other specified expenditure categories . Only privately contributed funds could be used for day-today expenses such as the maintenance of campaign headquarters , transportation and staff salaries . Counteraction Weighed , Some advocates of Federal campaign subsidies believe that Senator Gore 's move to repeal the Long law could best be I countered this week by the Senate 's adoption of amendments such as those suggested by the Neustadt group . Others fear that offering amendments ' at this time would " muddy the waters , " as one of them put it today , and perhaps weaken their case . Senator ? Long , who has been in Louisiana for several weeks and unavailable for questioning by telephone , has not indicated what strategy he will employ . Associates said he would probably rely mainly on a promise of early hearings by the Senate Finance Committee , of which he is chairman , on proposals for the modification or repeal of the financing law . White House aides said the Johnson Administration would adapt its strategy to Senator Long 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not yet know what the Senator 's approach would be . He is expected back on Tuesday .
