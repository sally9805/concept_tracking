By liberalizing the rules and brightening the students , Notre Dame 's President Theodore M. Hesburgh has been trying to create the liveliest Roman Catholic university in the U.S. But in the past " winter of discontent , " as he and Jack Kennedy put it , Hesburgh has been repaid with student editorials crying for freer rules and for his removal in favor of " a renowned lay educator . " Result : faculty censorship of three articles in the magazine Scholastic , the resignation of three student editors ; and a sizzling letter from Hesburgh to all 6,700 students . <P> " Discontent is not all bad , " wrote Hesburgh . It affects any feeling man " and will not be cured this side of the beatific vision . " But Notre Dame does not " consider faculty and students to be equal partners in the educative process . " So " if anyone seriously believes that he can not become well educated here without a car or girls in his room , or if he really thinks his personal freedom is impossibly restricted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests in the residence halls , then I think the only honest reaction is to get free of Notre Dame , not to expect Notre Dame to lose its unique character . " However much students may teach the faculty , bristled Hesburgh , " your primary role here is to learn and not to teach . Students who think otherwise should go out and found their own universities and then take lessons from their students . "
