Is the solar system unique ? Or are there other planets in orbit around other stars in the Milky Way and other galaxies ? Many scientists believe that stars with planetary systems are more the rule than the exception in the universe , but they have yet to prove it . Inter stellar distances are so great that the most powerful telescopes on earth are hopelessly inadequate for sighting small , dark planets that might be in orbit around other stars . <P> Undaunted by so formidable an obstacle , Astronomer Peter van de Kamp , the director of the Sproul Observatory at Swarthmore ( Pa . ) College , set out 31 years ago to search for dark companions of nearby stars . His long effort has been well rewarded . Last week the Dutch-born , 67-year-old astronomer an nounced the first " solid evidence " that there is a system of planets other than the solar system . He has detected two planets circling Barnard 's star , some 35 trillion miles away from the earth , in the constellation Ophiuchus . <P> Stubborn Search . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ets by using a classical astronomical technique : searching for irregularities in the path of a celestial body , a wobble that might be caused by the gravitational pull of a dark , unseen companion . As early as 1844 , for example , astronomers concluded from wobbles in the path of Sirius that the bright star was accompanied through space by a star too faint to be seen from earth . The same technique has been used to establish that several other apparently single stars are actually members of a binary sys tem ; they have stellar companions that are invisible from the earth . <P> In 1938 , when Van de Kamp started a concentrated search for these unseen companions , he and his assistants began to photograph at regular intervals some 40 of the stars closest to the earth , plotting their paths and looking for wobbles . They devoted most of their attention to Barnard 's star because it is the closest star visible in the Northern Hemisphere and moves across the sky ; rapidly in relation to the distant " fixed " stars , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We concentrated and gambled on one object , " i says Van de Kamp . " It was one of those crazy , stubborn , all-out efforts that paid off . " <P> Stubborn indeed . It was not until 1956 and thousands of photographic plates later that Van de Kamp was able to distinguish a significant disturbance in the path of Barnard 's star . And it was not until 1963 that he had analyzed his results carefully enough to announce that a planet-sized object rather than a dim star was orbiting Barnard . " I wanted to tread slowly , " he explains . " The Zeitgeist-the spirit of the time-had to be just right . " <P> Circular Orbits . One characteristic of the unseen Barnard planet disturbed Van de Kamp : its orbit seemed too elliptical in comparison with the nearly circular orbits of most solar-system planets . Patiently continuing his monitoring of the star , he exposed more photographic plates , refined his data , and early this year came to the conclusion that Barnard 's wobbles are caused not by a single planet in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
