The University of the South , perched on a plateau in the Cumberland Mountains at Sewanee , Tenn. , represents excellence in education wrapped in a tiny package . Only 787 students , all men , in habit its 10,000 acres . Its Sewanee Review is a first-rate literary quarterly . Its English department is one of the best ; it has an enviable one-to-twelve teacher-student ratio , and has turned out fifteen Rhodes scholars , one of the best records among colleges its size . <P> Because of that reputation , and because it is one of the few ( 8 ) U.S. colleges operated by the Episcopal Church , Sewanee attracts 20% of its enrollment from outside the South . Many Ivy League alumni send their sons to <P> Sewanee because , they say , they want their boys to get the same kind of small-school instruction that they had-but which the Ivy League has since outgrown . ( If Sewanee can not match the glories of Ivy League athletics , it can at least boast an illustrious football past : in 1899 , before football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas A. &; M. , Tulane , L.S.U. and Mississippi all in the same week . ) <P> Three years ago , the Ford Foundation decided to offer Sewanee an improvement grant of $2,500,000 . In doing so , it indirectly posed the question of whether Sewanee 's kind of excellence is really appreciated ; for , to get the gift , the school would have to raise $7,500,000 of its own . With only 6,600 living alumni , Sewanee could not find the money on its own . But about 11,000 people who had never attended the school sent donations ; 395 of them cared enough , in fact , to give $10,000 or more apiece . Last week Sewanee 's fund was past $8,000,000-and the Ford grant was clinched .
