As he thumbed through the Philadelphia Bulletin one afternoon , Walter H. Annenberg , publisher of Philadelphia 's morning Inquirer , paused to ponder a full-page ad . That his Inquirer carried no such ad concerned him less than the ad 's message : a Philadelphia TV magazine called TV Digest had reached a healthy circulation of 150,000 . Annenberg took immediate action . For about $3,000,000 he bought not only Philadelphia 's TV Digest but similar magazines in Chicago , Washington and New York , added new editions of his own , and stitched them all together under the name of TV Guide . <P> Thus , in April 1953 , was born the tiniest weekly bargain on any newsstand . TV Guide 's pages are 2 sq . in. smaller than the Reader 's Digest , a periodical designed for pockets . What it sells for 15 - principally the week 's program listings - is a staple of the daily press . The same schedules are available in more than 400 other TV magazines , many of them peddled free by pharmacies , supermarkets , department stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to distinction : with more than 8,000,000 in paid circulation , the tiniest magazine on the newsstands has become the biggest weekly magazine in the U.S. <P> One in Four . Despite its multitude of rivals , TV Guide has no serious competitor ; it is a pocket-size giant surrounded by envious pygmies . Since its creation , TV Guide has added circulation at the rate of 700,000 a year . Publisher James T. Quirk , 49 , expects circulation to climb to 12 million-a figure that would put TV Guide in every fourth TV home . <P> The magazine already smothers the U.S. - and part of Canada-with 63 editions , varying from a high of 1,500,000 ( metropolitan New York ) to a low of 10,000 ( Tucson ) . Even more editions are in the works ; Quirk plans to level off at 75 . This blanket coverage gives TV Guide what amounts to an impregnable monopoly . <P> Nor has the steady increase of TV magazine supplements in the Sunday press materially affected TV Guide . Although all four Chicago papers print TV magazines , TV Guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New York the Herald Tribune 's pocket-size Sunday TV magazine , the only one in Manhattan , has done TV Guide no damage-and the Trib no noticeable good . In 1955 , when its TV magazine was started , the Trib 's Sunday circulation was 550,000 ; it is 451,270 today . <P> TV Guide prospers on a circulation formula that bends many of the rules of the magazine publishing business . Although it does not discourage mail subscribers ( $14 million ) , neither does it actively encourage them , beyond printing clip-out coupons in the magazine . It sells more copies in supermarkets ( 3,300,000 ) than it does by mail ( 3,000,000 ) , and it is also distributed by beauty parlors , barber shops and auto supply stores . Of its 63 editions , only 14 are printed in the Philadelphia plant of Annenberg 's Triangle Publications , Inc. ( the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News , the Daily Racing Form , the New York Morning Telegraph and Seventeen ) ; the others are job-printed in 15 locations across the U.S.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
