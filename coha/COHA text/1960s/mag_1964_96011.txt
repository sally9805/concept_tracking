Roger Cox is 17 years old , 5 feet 3 and , counting his curly brown sideburns , he weighs a mere 100 pounds before breakfast . Of course , by the time he gets to breakfast it is going on lunchtime  --  10:30 , maybe 11  --  and he has been out on the job since dawn . Still , when it is set before him , he toys with the eggs , nibbles at a doughnut and sips tentatively at sweet , blond coffee . Mostly Roger bites his nails and smokes a lot  --  the skin on his left index finger is on its way to becoming leather  --  and watches the racetrackers come and go through the door of the Belmont Diner on New York City 's Hempstead Turnpike . The diner is directly across the road from gate 6 of Belmont Park , where Roger works mornings as an exercise boy , and his particular preoccupation at the moment is that he wants to be a flat-race jockey . He has been up North for two months , and he hopes it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs . In the meantime , it will help considerably if he does not put on weight , if his widowed mother in Miami does not worry and if his girl keeps up her letter-every-day routine . // Not that Roger is altogether brand-new to either going it alone or racing ; he has been around a little already . His father , who died a year ago last month , helped get him started . Mr. Cox was a baker in Miami , and he delivered cakes and rolls to the restaurants at Hialeah and Gulfstream Park . He also asked questions and kept his ears open . One thing he heard paid off . Following it up , Roger dropped out of high school and took a job with a trainer who shipped him up to Delaware and had him taught to ride . After about a year of raking out stalls and cleaning tack and galloping horses , Roger went home and in the best tradition of riders everywhere blew $800 in savings on three weeks of high living . That out of his system for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as an exercise boy at Belmont . The uniformed guard at the trainers ' gate scribbled him out a pass , and after calling at three barns  --  and being turned down  --  Roger got what he wanted in the fourth . He did not bother to ask about salary . " I 'm happy now , " he said . " I 've got a future . " // What Roger Cox might better have said is , " I think I 've got a future . " For the chance that he  --  or anyone else starting out  --  will make a lasting success of race riding is so slim it gives knowing insiders the shivers . " I 'd rather risk the rent money on the longest shot in the eighth race than go through that again , " says an oldtimer who tried and tried and never made it . What he is getting at is that , of the 1,200 active jockeys riding on this country 's 101 Thoroughbred tracks , barely two dozen have any national reputation or make the super-substantial sums of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of here-today success and prosperity , 95% of all riders find their money gone tomorrow when they retire . But a young man must necessarily overlook such down-in-the-mouth realities ; otherwise he would never get anywhere . It is far more to his purpose to think about a Cincinnati Dead End Kid named Howard Grant , who made more than $50,000 when he was 18 , or Eddie Arcaro , who never went to high school but wound up winning $30 million in purses. // Nor does it discourage a beginner to know that Bill Shoemaker earned $300,000 last year from riding , easily making him the richest man on four legs . And Bill Hartack has said that he stops working for money at the middle of the year and just keeps going for the experience . And what about Kokomo 's own Tod Sloan , who once threw a party for Lillian Russell that set him back $25,000 ? There was a fun guy . George M. Cohan thought so much of him , in fact , he wrote a song called Yankee Doodle Boy about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stand up and take a bow , provided you win the Kentucky Derby , the sacred cow of horse racing . Or , for real style , you can be like Hartack and refuse to show up ; after all , he has won the Derby four times and some people have plans for Sunday night . // Which in no way , shape or form is supposed to mean the pleasures and treasures of race riding can be totted up in bank accounts and guest appearances . " I loved sports as a kid , " says Eddie Arcaro , " but look at me . Who needed somebody my size on their football team ? So I went to a place I was wanted . " Says James L. Petty , a race rider who hails from Arkadelphia , Ark. : " I used to let it get me , but I 'd be more than dumb to be put out now ' cause I 'm little . Heck , my frame is my fortune . " // A question better ignored by the beginner , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a jockey , an insurance company would prefer that you did business with the agency down the street . The Jockeys ' Guild , a benevolent organization for all professional flat riders , has paid out almost $200,000 for medical care of crippled members , and , on the average , two riders are killed in racetrack accidents every year . A somewhat more fortunate guild member , Tony DeSpirito , was calculating his riding aches and pains the other day . He has lost his spleen , two ribs and a kidney , broken his back , broken his jaw and had his brain lacerated . " I 'm lucky I can still ride , " says Tony , who must be given to understating the case , " because it 's the only thing I know how to do . " // For whatever comfort it was , Eddie Arcaro liked to remind himself , " If you want to make it real big in racing , you ca n't be afraid of dying . " Says Jockey Ronnie Baldwin , the father of two sons : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt , you 're going to get hurt . So there 's no use worrying . I 'm lucky to have a wife who never says , ' Be careful , do be careful , ' as I 'm going out the door to work . That can get you down and ruin your riding . " The cautious approach is sometimes called the " married man 's style " and can best be described as the diametric opposite of bachelor Bill Hartack 's hell-for-leather technique . California Racing Secretary Jimmy Kilroe gives an example  --  of a sort . One day at Santa Anita a jockey named P.J. Bailey zipped in on the rail coming into the stretch in a race he had no chance of winning . His daring tactic merely moved his mount from seventh place to fifth . Later someone asked in bewilderment : " P.J. , what in the world were you trying to do ? " P.J. tipped back his racing helmet . " I du n no , " he allowed . " I was just testing myself for nerve , I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent edition , at that  --  to " jockey " means to execute by trickery and cheating , and it has not been too very long since mothers got their daughters in the house before dark if there was a race meeting in town . The wife of the great Ted Atkinson was the daughter of Ohio trotting-horse people , and it was just short of a scandal when she took up with that running-horse boy , never mind his good manners . And as anyone who was around will tell you , racing in the ' 20s and ' 30s , before the advent of film patrols and spying plainclothes Pinkerton detectives , was a thoroughly cutthroat affair . There was no hesitation at all about slashing another jockey in the face with a whip , or grabbing his saddlecloth , or driving him into  --  and , if possible , over  --  the rail . // The 1933 Kentucky Derby was won by Jockey Don Meade punching and kicking at the man beside him , and not a word was said by the stewards . ( The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to bending the rules to fit the situation , was later suspended from racing for betting on the outcome of races he rode . The trouble was he was betting on the other fellows ' horses . ) Says Ex-Jockey Willie Knapp : " Many of the guys who rode with me would n't last two races before being set down for a year these days . In my day 1918 we got a boy in a pocket and left him there . None of this business about giving racing room . " // Many of America 's first jockeys were slaves , and the rise from that low estate has been slow . " Even as late as the 1880s , " says Ted Atkinson , " the rider was just a sack of oats . His name was n't even mentioned . " Great gobs of relative prestige have been captured by jockeys since then , and for some people the name of the jockey nowadays is important to the exclusion of all other factors . At California 's old Tanforan track , for example . Bill Shoemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid entering their mounts in races they knew he was in . To put a stop to their cowardly  --  but sensible  --  attitude , the Tanforan stewards made jockeys ' names top secret until a race had been filled . Conversely , Chris Rogers , now a jockey in Canada , was riding for Calumet Farm at Hialeah one day and had a mount named Top Lea that was about to go off at 60 to 1 , the worst odds in years for a Calumet horse . Before the race , Trainer Jimmy Jones looked up at the tote board and back at Rogers and said : " This horse ca n't be that bad , Chris . It must be you that 's 60 to 1 . " // Higher standards of public education and child labor laws have done much to raise the status of race riders ; for modern jockeys , the Racing Form is something to scan after you have digested The Wall Street Journal . Few jockeys are high school graduates even now , but the trend is more toward than away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree in political science before taking up the ponies . Naturally , owners and trainers view the trend with alarm because it is getting harder and harder to find the likes of Harry Roble , who was the nation 's leading rider in 1931 when he was 13 . Thirteen-year-olds are lightweight , first , and do n't talk back , second . High school graduate Bill Hartack is only 113 , but talks back all the time , and who needs it ? One encouraging thing for the owners is the steady influx of underweight , underfed , undereducated boys from Latin America . But it is really not fair to suggest owners and trainers are cynical . Not very long ago one friend of racing nobly donated a part of his library to the Aqueduct jockeys ' room so the boys would have something better to do than shoot pool , play ping-pong and watch As the World Turns all afternoon . The titles include Liberalism and American Education in the Eighteenth Century and The Rainy Day Book for Boys and Girls and The Economic Almanac 1941-42 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were put on the shelf just shows some jockeys care nothing for self-improvement anyway . // If the finished product of jockeys is nevertheless on a general cultural upswing , the source of the jockey raw material has stayed pretty much the same since Abraham Lincoln shut off the earliest supply . By and large , all riders come from poor and lower-middle-class families , and a good proportion of them come from the West . Jimmy Picou , once a jockey and now a trainer ( his Mr. Brick finished sixth in the Derby ) , is the son of a Texas refinery worker who had 16 children . Jimmy raced quarter horses from the time he was 8 , and became a middling Thoroughbred jockey until he grew too heavy . Jimmy 's father made him finish the 10th grade , but Bobby Ussery , an Oklahoman who is now New York 's leading rider , gave up in the seventh grade to become a stable-boy . But good riders are not necessarily made in their formative years . There are many like Atkinson and Hartack . Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acquaintance convinced him that he should be a jockey and helped him enroll in a riding academy in The Bronx . Atkinson was 20 and already too old , they said , to make much of a career . Still , he won 3,795 races before he retired 25 years later . " I figured I 'd been around the world twice on horseback by then , " he said . " Besides , my back was killing me . " Hartack , son of a Pennsylvania coal miner , had just graduated ( in the top third of his high school class ) when a friend took him to a track in West Virginia . He saw four spills , but somehow was not discouraged . Unpretentious beginnings have the virtue of making a jockey 's success sweeter . John Sellers , another Oklahoman , slept in a tack room at Churchill Downs in Louisville when he started out as a stableboy . Nine years later he was in the Kentucky Derby winner 's circle aboard the magnificent Carry Back . " You 've come a little ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over toward that old green barn . But humble beginnings do not necessarily beget extravagant endings . " I made up my mind early I 'd settle to be a big frog in a little pond , " says Joe Servis , a former jockey who rode the small tracks and is now an executive of the Jockeys ' Guild . And you have never heard a lot said , one way or another , about Merlin Volzke from Nebraska . The fact is , Volzke rode Extra Swell in this year 's Derby and has been riding on the West Coast since 1942 , when he gave up basketball as it began to outgrow him . So law-abiding that he has never been set down for breaking the rules , Merlin likes to bowl and to invest in A.T . &amp; T. Nothing fancy about William Dillard Lucas , either . Son of a fairgrounds jockey and saloonkeeper , Lucas is a Kentuckian who rides at small tracks in the Midwest and makes so much money he takes off three months in the winter to shoot squirrels . Ronnie Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has no illusions about riding on New York 's premier circuit . " Who would use me ? " he asks . " I get plenty of work in Kentucky and New Orleans , and I gross about $40,000 a year . That 's ample , I guess . " // There is a normal progression in the life of a jockey . Shortcuts , such as might be provided by a jockey school , have never been satisfactorily developed in this country , and any jockey not an owner 's son has been a stableboy in his day . Like Roger Cox , stableboys do the dirty work that goes on behind the scenes of glamorous racing , and if they do it willingly enough the trainer may soon let them commence to exercise the horses . If a boy is a good morning rider , the trainer may then take a chance and put him in a race , but no one can tell in advance how it is going to work out . " I 've seen exercise boys who were the greatest horsemen in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvester Veitch . " I mean , a boy may be a world-beater . But in the afternoon it 's the damndest thing . He 's nothing . It 's like taking an outfielder from the Mineola Mudlarks and putting him in Yankee Stadium . He could n't catch a basketball . " The money , of course , is made in the afternoon . An exercise boy , with room and board , need not be paid more than $100 a month his first year on the job . A race rider , however , is paid for every mount ( $10 for losing in a cheap race , scaled up to $50 for winning a big race ) . On top of that , a jockey gets 10% of the winner 's purse . The owners call this a gratuity , since it is not required by racing rules . Jack Price , owner and trainer of Carry Back , who won him $1.25 million , tried operating without this gratuity when he first got into racing . Price soon discovered he could not stay in racing without jockeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swing of things . When such a gratuity amounts to $19,000 , as it did for William McKinley Cook last year after he and Hurry to Market won the Garden State Stakes , it is some tip . One other possible source of afternoon income is betting , which a jockey is allowed to do , with the proviso that  --  unlike Don Meade  --  he bets on his own horse and the bet is placed through the owner . // But even rich jockeys become defensive when it is suggested that race riding is all gravy . A jockey has high operating expenses , for one thing . Some estimates say he spends up to 45% of his gross in equipment , travel , on-the-road lodging , fees to his jockeys ' - room valet and commissions to the agent who books his mounts . Says Bill Hartack , who grossed about $25,000 in this year 's Derby and Preakness alone , " A man who makes $25,000 a year for 20 years saves three times as much as the jock who makes $500,000 in five . But in racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or injured . If a jock quit at 19 with $80,000 , he could n't live comfortably for more than 10 years . It takes $10,000 a year to live comfortably . Hell , he 'd be broke at 29 , and people would say he was an s.o.b . for throwing his money away . You think if I quit I 'd be riding around in a new Cadillac every year ? Hell , no . I 'd be driving last year 's Chevrolet. " // The rules of racing do not let just anybody come blasting out of the starting gate for a try at the bankruptcy Hartack describes . As the authoritative voice of U.S. racing , The Jockey Club has determined that a prospective professional race rider must spend an apprenticeship of no less than three years with an owner or trainer of racehorses . An apprentice must be between 16 and 25 years old , and roughly 10% of the active jockeys at any time are apprentices ( the asterisks beside their names in race programs has given rise to the title " bug boys " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprentices are bound to their original employer by a contract that begins with sinister feudalistic overtones : " This indenture ... " In the bargain , the boy agrees " faithfully , honestly and industriously to serve the Employer as stable boy and rider of horses .... " For his part , the employer must pay his boy at least $100 a month for the first year and provide " suitable and proper board , lodging and medical attention . " For Bill Boniface , now racing editor for the Baltimore Sunpapers but an apprentice when he was 15 , medical attention was a horse pill " the size of a golf ball " that his employer once made him take when he attempted to use a stomachache as an excuse for not riding a particularly fractious horse . For Max Hirsch. the trainer for Texas ' King Ranch , medical attention is $850 worth of dental work that must be done on a recently signed apprentice . " He 's got promise , " says Hirsch , a man who likes apprentices : he sent Ira Hanford and Bold Venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won he repeated the trick with Bill Boland and Middleground in 1950 . But , says Hirsch , just having an apprentice around is becoming more like work every year . An ex-jockey himself , Hirsch complains , " Only one apprentice out of a million makes a rider . " And even that one , he says , " wo n't do a day 's work . Used to be a boy saw his duty and did it , but no more . Instead , he 's got to read the papers and see what writer is praising him to the skies and making a fool out of him . The papers ruin more boys than you would imagine . " Ronnie Ferraro , an apprentice of a few years back , hews to the same line . " When I drive to work , " he once said , " I take a look into the gutter to see if there are any old jockeys lying there  --  jockeys who believed everything that was said about them . " // In actual racing , apprentice riders are treated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , too , have their valets in the jockeys ' room who polish their boots , lay out the right silks , carry their saddles and accept $5 for every winning mount and $3 for every loser . But to give apprentices some ammunition against the seasoned journeymen , beginners are given certain weight allowances . If , for example , a 3-year-old horse is assigned 117 pounds for a particular six-furlong race , he may be raced under an apprentice at only 107 pounds . The more races an apprentice wins , however , the less the allowance he is given , until it disappears altogether after about a year . Often apprentice riders-are impressive only because they are so light their mounts can flutter ahead to the lead and hold it to the finish . This tactic is not necessarily astute race riding . Accordingly , apprentices frequently fizzle when they must compete against the Shoemakers and Usserys on equal weight terms . For one thing , trainers , who are fickle creatures anyway , suddenly lose interest in them and do not give them strong horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their succeeding mounts are cheaper still . But other apprentices have so much skill their pace never slackens when they lose the bug . Shoemaker rode 219 winners in his first nine months of riding , and in the succeeding 15 years has ridden 4,300 more . Naturally , once a rider no longer has the weight allowance , he tends to begrudge it to those who do . It even splits up families . Glynn and Kenward Bernis are jockey brothers in Louisiana , with the difference that Glynn , an apprentice , leads his brother in winners this year about 3 to 2 . Just recently they brawled with one another as they hurtled down the stretch . " Ken , " said Glynn , " is mad as hell at me because I 'm winning . " // Until a few years ago , it was customary for an apprentice contract to be followed by a journeyman contract , in which a rider agreed to work for just one stable . Ted Atkinson rode for Green-tree Stable and Eddie Arcaro rode for Calumet Farm . Such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it guaranteed them the best horses the stable might have , bad because they were also obliged to ride the stable 's platers as well . Nowadays , however , nearly all jockeys are free-lance contractors , with a few working on a retainer basis . Manuel Ycaza is retained on a first-call arrangement with Harry Guggenheim 's Cain Hoy Stable , i.e. , he is required to ride whenever Guggenheim asks ; otherwise he is on his own . Braulio Baeza , until a few weeks ago , was on a first-call contract with Fred Hooper Jr. , who brought Baeza up from Panama four years ago . The contract paid $1,000 a month plus 10% of any purses Baeza won for Hooper . Then , just when Hooper wanted Baeza in Kentucky , Baeza wanted to ride in New York . The way this tension was resolved was for Baeza to give Hooper $100,000 and for Hooper to give Baeza the contract . // As the free-lance rider has emerged , so , too has the jockey 's agent . Like theatrical agents , these men book their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can claim  --  and rightly , too  --  some of the credit for a jockey 's success . A good rider with a bad agent could easily find himself on a string of losers ; any popularity he might have had with trainers would be seriously affected , for trainers are wary of losing jockeys . A bad jockey hiring a good agent , on the other hand , might show immediate improvement . In any event , for every leading agent there is a leading rider , and vice versa. // The best agent is the best handicapper , the best man at doping out which horse is most likely to win which race . But agents must also be talent scouts and smooth , convincing salesmen . Chick Lang discovered Bill Hartack in West Virginia and was his agent for six stormy , profitable years . Harry Silbert spotted Bill Shoemaker in California one day , and Silbert 's fortune was made . Assuming Silbert has received the 20% share of the purses that top riders pay their agents , Harry has grossed a tidy $5,558,528 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easy enough to book Shoe and Hartack now , " says a friendly rival , " but it took a lot of selling in the beginning . I 'll admit a jock is better than an empty saddle , but it 's the agent that 's got to go down to the barn and make it sound like the jock is something really important . Looked at that way , we do n't get 20% of his winnings ; we let the jock keep 80% of what 's coming to us . " This attitude is expressed more subtly in the day-to-day conversations of all agents . No agent ever says , " My boy win this or that . " It is always , " I win the Derby , " and " I win three yesterday , " etc. // Ted Atkinson once attributed his success to " fast horses and a good agent , " and it is a rare jockey who can book mounts for himself successfully . They are notoriously poor handicappers . " Once I tried to mark a program for a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then riding at Hialeah . " When he got through following my selections , he had to borrow train fare back North . " Other bettors are not so interested in the jockey 's personal choices as in mystical information about him that will help them put down an intelligent $2 wager . Said a lady horseplayer to John Sellers one day : " Mr. Sellers , would you please tell me the exact day , hour and minute you were foaled ? " The give and take between jockeys and bettors ( who pay the freight for everybody ) sometimes gets more tense . About 10 years ago in Florida , a man telephoned Ted Atkinson and Conn McCreary with a straightforward proposition : they would tell him which horse would win certain races or he would kill them . He directed the jockeys to signal the winner 's number by wearing a Band-Aid on a certain finger while in the walking ring before the race . // McCreary and Atkinson went to the police , and the next day , with plain-clothesmen everywhere , nothing happened . An officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . " Frankly , chief , " said McCreary , " they all looked suspicious to me. " // The question of how much a jockey I contributes to racing  --  and why one can win and another can not  --  has been asked countless times but never satisfactorily answered . Owners and trainers disagree among themselves . Mrs. C.V . Whitney will say that " jockeys are conductors of a symphony in motion , " while iconoclastic Jack Price would like to see jockeys eliminated . " I wish horses would chase a mechanical carrot , or something , " he says . " That would prove what horse was the best . As far as I 'm concerned , when a horse wins a big race the jock should go back to the jocks ' room while the horse has his picture taken with the owner , the trainer and the groom . What 's the jock done anyhow ? Sat on the animal 's back for two minutes while it ran in a circle . And for that he gets 10% of my money ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many jockeys agree that their role is overrated by some people . Buddy Jacobson , the trainer who is leading in winners in the country this year , is not guilty of this . " The trouble is , " he says , " we blame jockeys for losing a race , so we naturally  --  but incorrectly  --  give them credit for winning a race . Provided they are both in good physical shape , I think one jockey is as good as another . So I make a chart . I give points  --  20 points for winning on a 20-to-l shot , three points for winning on a 3-to 1 favorite . Then I divide by the number of races . The jockeys work out about equal . What makes the difference is the horse . And the last thing I want to hear is a rider 's opinion about a horse . They ca n't tell me anything , so I hide when I see one coming my way . " // Because trainers get 10% of the winning purse , too , some take the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clarence W. Smith , a Detroit owner , tells this story . " I was with another owner at the races last season and his trainer had bought him a horse for $80,000 . Well , this horse runs out  --  by about 22 lengths , I 'd say  --  and the trainer bangs things around in the owner 's box and hollers that the jock rode a stupid race . So they fire the jock . Well , that same horse ran five more times  --  all out of it  --  before the owner realized the trainer was just putting the blame on the jocks . In this case the jocks could n't make something out of a horse that was n't there . " // An understanding attitude by an owner like Smith is rare , and jockeys ought to appreciate his kind . Smith 's most famous horse was Hillsdale , and the jockey he chose to ride it was Tommy Barrow who was not , if you want the truth , the greatest jockey who ever saddled up . In fact , Barrow made some pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who say one of his errors was the only reason Hillsdale did not win Worse of the Year honors in 1959 and Sword Dancer did . In the Woodward Stakes , Barrow took Hillsdale off the rail in the final turn and let Arcaro and Sword Dancer squeak through to win . " Tommy could n't explain it , and neither can I , " says Smith calmly . " It was over , and what are you going to do ? Tommy was good enough for me. " // Jockeys may or may not help the way a horse works , but one thing that they most certainly do is work themselves . " Riding a mile is like running a mile , " Howard Grant once said . " I get off and ca n't hardly breathe . " That jockeys should have to go without food to be allowed to labor that hard is racing 's final irony . There are some riders who never have the problem , but for most , Grant among them , losing weight is an almost constant battle . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped cream  --  a luxury John Sellers permitted himself just the other day . " Calories do n't count , " said Jockey Robert Parrott at Churchill Downs recently , " because you 're already down to muscle and bone . The fight is to get rid of the liquid in your body . " And he took a slow pull on a bottle of Coke . He had not taken off the cap ; he had merely run an ice pick through it so he could not drink it as fast as he would have liked . // The principal way that jockeys " make weight " is through long sieges in the steam room or hot room that every racetrack makes available , and where jockeys sit hour after hour in the morning dealing waterproof playing cards or reading soggy papers . Some jockeys take pills to hold down their appetites  --  a leading jockey 's recent divorce was attributed in part to the pills he took ; they made him so irritable no one could stand to be with him . Jack Wallace , an Ohio jockey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " but then I ai n't hungry after I 've chewed one . " // Clare Critchfield , now chief of stalls at Gulfstream Park , is probably the only jockey in history to come in overweight for his very first race . That was in 1930 , and Critchfield had a weight problem every day thereafter for 20 years , eventually getting so proficient at losing weight by drinking a sweat-inducing " blend of coffee and whiskey that he could tell within two ounces of where he stood . While an occasional jockey will seek a scientific solution  --  Jimmy DelVecchio spent $3,500 being fitted to a no-salt diet at the Duke University Medical Center  --  others invent their own recipes . Conn McCreary used to drink a 250 box of Ex-Lax dissolved in coffee , and some jockeys force themselves to regurgitate a meal they have just finished . // The penalties for such mistreatment of the human body can be severe . One of the best-known symbols of American horse racing is the bent-double figure of Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons , for half a century an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jockey , too , and he had quite a bit of trouble making weight . The extreme measures he employed  --  including standing before the white-hot heat of a brick kiln  --  left him , he says , with his twisted spine . // It can be a rich life , a full life and at exciting life , but nobody is ever going to contend that being a jockey is an easy life .
