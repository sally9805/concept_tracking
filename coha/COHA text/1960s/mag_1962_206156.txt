The presidential press conference was more than half over when a stocky , blonde woman reporter finally got the floor . " Sir , " began Sarah McClendon , Washington correspondent for a string of 14 dailies in Texas and New England , " two well-known security risks have recently been put on a task force in the State Department to help reorganize the Office of Security . " John F. Kennedy 's face froze . Before Mrs. McClendon could go on , he interrupted her . " Well , now , " said the President coldly . " Who ? " <P> Not a bit flustered , Newshen McClendon named William Arthur Wieland and J. Clayton Miller-two State Department aides who , far from working in the sensitive Office of Security , hold routine administrative jobs in State 's Office of Management . As Kennedy well knew , neither man had ever been considered a security risk . Taut with anger , he proceeded to tell Sarah McClendon just that . " I would say that the term you 've used to describe them is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared to substantiate . " He hoped , added Kennedy , that the two men could perform their jobs " without detriment to their characters by your question . " <P> <P> Beyond Chivalry . Brassy Sarah McClendon did not begin calling attention to herself by needling Presidents until Dwight Eisenhower , by opening the presidential press conference to direct quotation and requiring reporters to identify themselves , gave her an irresistible chance for self-promotion . After the conference moved into the big audience medium of TV , Sarah found her true mtier . <P> She got under Dwight Eisenhower 's skin with great regularity . In 1958 , after Mrs. McClendon had begun an inquiry into the potentially " dictatorial " character of Ike 's Pentagon reorganization plan , the President broke in angrily to ask : " Have you read the law ? " When Reporter McClendon said she had , Ike hotly retorted : " No , you have n't , I do n't think . " On another occasion , exasperated beyond chivalry , Eisenhower demanded whether she was " asking a question or making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in identifying herself , used to name one paper after another- " Do you get fired every week and join another paper the next week ? " <P> Beyond Ignoring . Texas-born Sarah McClendon , 49 , plays the role of President-baiter by both temperament and design . As a cub reporter in Tyler , Texas , she once picked up a telephone and clobbered a clergyman who was pummeling her editor for running an uncomplimentary story . This same pugnacity has characterized her behavior in Washington . When Sarah rises at presidential press conferences , it is not just the President who winces ; an almost audible shudder runs through the room . Typically , Sarah arrives early , so as to get a seat down front , bounces up and down with a persistence that both Eisenhower and Kennedy have found impossible to ignore . <P> After her losing joust with Kennedy . Reporter McClendon fell unnaturally silent-inspired , perhaps , by word from State Department Legal Adviser Abram Chayes , who said that her statement to Kennedy was " defamatory on its face . " Besides , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
