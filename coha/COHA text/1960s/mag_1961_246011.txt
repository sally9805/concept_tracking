Two years ago , Ceylon 's Prime Minister Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike bowed respectfully before a Buddhist monk among the crowd of petitioners gathered on his veranda , in return got a blast of four bullets in his body . He clung to life long enough to utter a last request . " I appeal to all concerned to show compassion to this man and not to try and wreak vengeance on him , " he said , and died . <P> <P> Disregarding " Banda 's " dying wish , a Ceylon judge last week sentenced Tal-duwe Somarama , 45 , to death . But the trial had proved that Somarama had been only the triggerman ; the instigator and chief plotter had been Mapitigama Buddharakitha , 41 , high priest of the Kelaniya temple outside Colombo . <P> High Priest Buddharakitha was clearly a man who was more interested in power than religion . In 1956 , when Bandaranaike was running for election , Buddharakitha organized the United Monks ' Front , which went scuttling off to the hustings to recommend Banda and his Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddhism its " rightful place " in Ceylon and to make Sinhala , the tongue spoken by most Ceylonese Buddhists , the official language of the land . <P> Banda won the election and became Prime Minister . In token of his gratitude , he took his Cabinet to Buddharakitha 's temple for the customary postinaugural rites . He also gave the post of Minister of Health to Buddharakitha 's intimate friend , the handsome widow Vimala Wijewardene , then 47 . But when the high priest demanded a $6,000,000 government contract for the construction of a sugar factory and government concessions for a shipping company he planned to set up , Banda balked . Buddharakitha , who had reveled in his position as kingmaker , felt that he had been publicly humiliated . He decided to put Banda out of the way . <P> Casting about for a triggerman , he happened on Talduwe Somarama , who was both a monk and a practicing ophthalmologist . As a Buddhist , Somarama was exasperated at the Prime Minister 's delay in fulfilling his campaign promises to Buddhism . As an ophthalmologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Indigenous Hospital renewed , and therefore needed Buddharakitha 's good offices , for the widow Wijewardene had put the high priest on the hospital 's appointment board . Plainly , Somarama was Buddharakitha 's man . <P> <P> In a confession that he later disavowed . <P> Assassin Somarama straightforwardly declared : " I have done this thing to a man who did me no wrong-for the sake of my religion , my language and my race . " High Priest Buddharakitha truculently declared that he had been railroaded . The judge unhesitatingly sentenced both Somarama and Buddharakitha to hang .
