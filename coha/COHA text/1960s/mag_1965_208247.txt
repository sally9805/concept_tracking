Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution clearly states that " in the case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President . " But what constitutes presidential disability ? Who judges it ? What would have happened had John Kennedy not been killed by an assassin 's bullet but had lived on , seriously injured ? <P> Vice Presidents have long hesitated to stand in for disabled Presidents . In 1881 the country was leaderless for the 80 days that Garfield lay dying . During Wilson 's breakdown , 28 bills became law by default of any presidential action . Though a " committee " of Cabinet and White House staff members car ried on after Eisenhower 's heart attack , Vice President Nixon warned that it might have failed " had there been a serious international crisis requiring presidential decisions . " <P> <P> Power &; Principles . Last week the Senate finally faced up to the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment giving Vice Presidents full power until disabled Presidents recover. * Sponsored by Indiana Democrat Birch Bayh , the amendment provides that if a President fails to make known his inability , the Vice President could take over " with the written concurrence of a majority of the Cabinet or any other body specified by Congress . " If a still unrecovered President tried to return , the Acting President and the Cabinet would have seven days in which to ask Congress to " proceed to decide " the issue . To retain power , the Acting President would need a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress . <P> When the Administration-backed proposal reaches the House it will face more of the same sort of opposition it survived in the Senate : the argument that the problem should be solved by statute rather than constitutional amendment . Critics note that statutes , unlike amendments that contain rules as specific as those in the Bayh proposal , are easily revised to meet changing needs . " The strength of the Constitution rests upon its broad statement of power and principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is not weighed down with detailed procedural provisions . " <P> Unfortunately , though , the Constitution does not clearly empower Congress to handle presidential disability by statute alone . Indeed , Bayh backers argue that such a statute might worsen the next disability crisis because it would be open to constitutional challenge . By contrast , an amendment becomes part of the Constitution , and Congress would have the right to pass later disability legislation if necessary .
