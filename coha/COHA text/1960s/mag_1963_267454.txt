On clay fragments , in papyrus records - the words were everywhere : " Gone . " Battered by oppressive taxes and tormented by religious persecution , the Christian Copts ( their name comes from an Arab corruption of the Greek word for Egyptian ) slipped from the bulging cities of 5th century Egypt into the silent desert , well in advance of the convulsive social earthquakes that rent the New Age from antiquity . <P> They found new roots in their own experience as farmers , brickmakers and weavers . Monks flocked to new monastic communities from among the common people as the Copts grew further away from the mainstream Christian churches . In succeeding centuries , they developed their own Christian liturgy and a Christian art that eerily foreshadowed the religious paintings , illuminations and tapestries of medieval and Renaissance Europe . <P> A Paper-Doll Stare . Offering a rare opportunity to see this uncommon art , the Villa Hugel-formerly the mam Krupp estate in Essen , Germany-has assembled an exhaustive exhibition of Coptic art from private collectors and museums : some 625 works ranging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century examples from Nubia and Ethiopia . <P> Almost from the start , the Copts rejected the Hellenic way of doing things . Their early life-size statues and full-face portraits are near copies of Greek models , but the cold formality is muted with familiar gestures and folk costumes . As the flight to the desert progressed , their vision became more provincial , and the classicism was discarded . Their sculpture grew smaller and more personal , painting became fragmentary instead of monumental . There is a childlike naivete in the coy games of god and goddess , the paper-doll stare of a saint , the back-patting of Christ and a monk ( see color ) . <P> In the stone-fast monasteries , ability to paint and carve figures in lifelike proportion was forgotten , and faces began to take on fixed expressions of wonder , glee and terror . But " primitive " art is often closer to nature than the well-drawn , finely carved academy pieces of " high culture , " and despite their lack of textbook accuracy , the Coptic artists were expressing their real concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their daily lives against the Christian vision . <P> Across the silent ages , these small treasures are the voices of a people both busy and devout : ivory angels carved on a comb , a double lamp in a twin-tailed bronze dove , a polka-dotted leather sandal , a rabbit nibbling round fruit on a woven wool square . Textiles-wall hangings for tombs , shirts and coats for the dead-form perhaps the highest level of Coptic art , and the hot , dry desert climate has preserved some of the best examples : representations of everyday occurrences , proud portrayals of heroic scenes , and obedient evocations of saints and holy acts . <P> A World Too Fragile . With the triumph of the Arabs in Egypt , the Copts were increasingly harassed and forced into lives of strict self-discipline in order to preserve their communities . Eventually , the pressures ground too fine , and the great tradition decayed as Copts found their world too fragile against the Islamic majority .                  @ @ @
