coming long enough in advance , and then we 'd go away and stay away until it was over . Most of the time we stayed longer than that , so that Chrissie could have a good time traveling around when she was well , too . She was a great traveler , Jimmy . Good to be with , you know . " " She had a lot of spark , " my Uncle Jimmy said . " But I do n't get this . If you 're such a hawkeye and could always spot this thing coming on , how come you missed it this time , hah ? " " I do n't know , " my father said wearily . " I just do n't know . It could have been a hundred things  --  " " And it could have been that it was n't there at all ! " my Uncle Jimmy said . " Hah ? How does that strike you ? Not subtle enough ? Just maybe you did n't spot it because there was n't anything to spot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever think of anythingstraight like that ? You said there was always a warning every other time : well , where was the warning this time ? Why do n't you ask yourself that question ? " " I 've asked myself all the questions , " my father said . " It 's true there was n't any warning . Or it 's true that I did n't see one . But you do n't understand : these things do n't always happen the same way . There did n't have to be that warning . It could come on in an instant : I was told that . And I was told it so that I could guard against it . But it never had happened , and I guess maybe I thought it never would . I guess I got lax . I used to let her do things which were all against the books . Nothing ever happened . And yet I knew , or should have known : I 've been through all this with a hundred doctors . I suppose I know as much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't help Chrissie much , did it ? " " You drive me bananas ! " my Uncle Jimmy said . " Now listen to me ! First , this canoe business . You 're not trying to tell me it 's impossible to fall out of a canoe and leave it dry , are you ? You 're not saying that nobody 's ever done it , nobody ever could do it ? Listen , I 'll guarantee you I can get fifty palookas , right now , to fallp101out of fifty canoes , and when they 're all out half the canoes will be dry ! So what are you really saying ? All you 're saying is it 's hard to do , right ? " " No , " my father said . " All I 'm saying is just what I said before , and that is that it 's unlikely . And when two people are involved , and when one of them is a little boy , then it becomes extremely unlikely . " " Okay , " my Uncle Jimmy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that mean ? It means that it might not have happened , but on the other hand it just might have . Right ? It might have . So that 's one thing . Then we go on to Chrissie , and that 's where you 're walking around with your thumb in your mouth , Buster ! Because you 've got nothing ! You 're tearing yourself to bits , and why ? Because you 're playing a game of eenie meenie minie moe ! You 're guessing , Buster ! You do n't know that a single thing was wrong with her that day , right ? I mean , really know ? " " You 're always asking me to listen to you , " my father said , " but you never listen to me . I 'm not complaining , but it would make it easier if you did . Now look : you 're telling me that I really do n't know . But is n't that exactly what I said to you in the beginning : I do n't know ? And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the trouble ? Ca n't you understand that , Jimmy ? What are you trying to prove to me : that it 's not a certainty that Chrissie did this , that it 's just a possibility ? Do n't you think I know that ? It 's the one thing I do know . And I know just how strong the possibility was , and I know it a lot better than you . And I know that because I lived with Chrissie and I loved her and I know what she could do and what she could n't , and I know what happened before and I know better than anyone on earth just what could have happened that day . I do n't know that it actually did happen that way , but the could have is enough , believe me . Because as long as I live I 'll never know anything more than that , there 's no way I can . Is there ? So this is the way I live now , Jimmy . Not knowing exactly how it happened , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how it probably happened . And knowing too just one more thing : that if it did happen that way , it had no right to . Because it could have been stopped , it should have been stopped ! And by me , Jimmy ! By me ! I should have stopped it , I 'm the only one who could have ! But oh my God my God ! " my father cried , his voice suddenly suddenly going way up almost to a scream and reaching out and soaring up through the fireplace right out to me in a great wild desperate shout , " I did n't ! Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy , I did n't ! " And even after he finished , his voice still seemed to hang in the room , shaking through it and filling it , and I remember that even in the midst of everything I looked over at Phil in a panic , afraid that he might have awakened and heard everything . But he had n't ; he was still sleeping away . By now I was sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little toward the sound as I had been listening , and now I sat there absolutely still , as if I had been frozen there and could n't move until something else happened . After a while I realized that the echo of my father 's cry had gone , and that now there was nothing but the silence again . Then , from downstairs , I heard a small and different sound : not clear , but muffled , the sound of someone who might have been crying but who was trying not to cry . And I knew this could n't have been my Uncle Jimmy , because now I could hear him speak over the sobbing sound . " You poor bastard , " he said , kind of softly . And even though it was a swearword , it did n't sound as though he were swearing . It sounded as though he were talking to my father in the best way he ever had . " Come on , Buster , " he said , after a couple of seconds . " Come on now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear anything more , no words and no more sobbing , and after a little while I knew that they had left theroom and had gone to their beds for the night . I sat there for a while at the foot of my bed . It was raining hard103outside now  --  it must have started some time ago , but I had n't even noticed it  --  and the room was damp and cold . I felt chilly , and suddenly I began to tremble ; I got back in under the covers , pulling them all up over me , even the big brown downy puff that was used mostly in winter . Pretty soon I felt warmer , but the funny thing was that the trembling did n't stop right away . I closed my eyes tight , not to try to go back to sleep  --  I knew I could n't do that now  --  but mostly to help me think about all the different and confusing and even frightening things I had just been listening to . I tried hard to remember everything , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , because I had the idea that if I could only remember enough and put it all together and go over it by myself I might be able to understand it  --  or at least to understand it a lot better than I did right now . But all the words kept whizzing around and sailing through my head in no special order at all , and whenever I tried to stop and think of any one of them and what it meant , the very next second I would be thinking of something that was n't connected with it at all : my grandfather and how mean he was to his family , my Uncle jimmy and my Aunt Mary and how they wanted to take me with them and bring me up , my father and how he did n't any longer have as much money as he used to have . These things , all of them , came as a surprise to me , because nobody , not even my father , had talked about them to me before , and now that I had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because it seemed to me that all these things , everything that my father or my Uncle Jimmy had talked about tonight , were in some way sad and unhappy . It was as if whatever they had done or been through had for some reason not turned out the way they hoped it would but instead had got all tangled up or twisted around , so that in the end almost everybody wound up being disappointed or miserable or in some dreadful kind of trouble . And this made me feel awful , partly because I did n't want to believe that things were like this , but mostly because it was myp104father who seemed to be saying that they were . In all the time we had spent together , he had never talked to me in this gloomy way , not even right after my mother had died , and when I heard him tonight I did n't know what to think . At first I thought that maybe he did n't really mean it , that while he might not actually be joking  --  I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  still , he might be just talking for the sake of arguing or of trying to make my Uncle Jimmy mad . But then , when he began to talk about my mother , I knew that this was wrong , because he never would have done that about her . Still , what he did say about her was even more confusing than anything else he had said , because he seemed to be telling my Uncle Jimmy that maybe the accident in the canoe had n't been an accident after all ! This did n't make any sense to me , because of course I knew it had been an accident : I had been there ! And so had my father : we had both gone out on the lake together , we had found my mother 's empty canoe , and there had been nobody but ourselves for miles around  --  so then , what else could it have been but an accident ? It was all very baffling , I could n't understand anything about it or why my father was talking like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he had talked about my mother as though she had been sick a lot , when I knew perfectly well that she had never been sick at all ! I knew this not only because I never saw her sick , but because she told me so herself . Doctors sometimes came to our house to see Tom and me , and a couple of times they came for my father , but no doctor had ever come to see my mother , and I remembered now that one day I had asked her why this was . She had just laughed and said , " What would a doctor come to see me for ? Doctors only come to see sick people , Jackie , and you know me : I 'm Sweet Sunshine Susie Brown , remember ? " This was from a song she used to sing : I 'm Sweet Sunshine Susie Brown , I 'm the healthiest happiest gal in town ... .  |p105But  then I remembered my father saying to my Uncle Jimmy that my mother had been sick only when they were away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too  --  I mean , that you would be sick only away from home . And also , even if she had been sick sometimes and had n't wanted to tell me about it , that could n't have had anything to do with her accident in the canoe , because on that morning I had been with her , or at least near her , most of the time , and so I knew for sure that she had n't been sick then . She had been just as happy and gay as she always was , maybe even more so , and I remembered that once during the morning , when I left my father for a minute and went inside the cabin to get a drink of water from the pump over the sink  --  there was no running water in the cabin  --  my mother saw me and suddenly stopped her cleaning and came over to me . I do n't know where Tom was , but he was n't around right then : there were just the two of us . And my mother reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as little as Tom , not all the way off the floor but up to the tips of my toes , and said , in a whispery singing voice , " Oh Jackie boy , Jackie boy , where have you been ? "  --  just as if it were a part of another song . Then she looked at me and gave me a hug and a kiss and took me by one hand and twirled me around in a kind of dance step before she laughed and let me go and then went back to her work . I went back out to my father , and started to tell him what had happened inside , but then I did n't , because we both got busy nailing on some of the new shingles . But that 's how I knew that on that morning my mother was just fine . So , then , I lay in my bed now , worried and wondering because my father and my mother had seemed to say such very different things , and I could n't see how this could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever find out now , because of course I could n't ask my father , since then he would know that I had been listening . And then , just before I fell asleep , I began to wonder if he might not know anyway , if maybe he might not be able to guess from something I might say without meaning to , or from some different wayp106I might act . I hoped he would n't , not just because he might get mad , but because he might think I had been sneaky or spying on him and then maybe he might change his feelings toward me . And more than anything else I did n't want that to happen , because he was my father , and because it seemed to me that too much had changed already . But the next day everything went along all right . My father and my Uncle Jimmy behaved just as they usually did toward each other , as if they had n't had their long talk at all , and my father was just the same as ever to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and outside of being puzzled , I of course felt just the same  --  because he did n't say a word to show that he had noticedanything special or different about me . It was only two days later  --  early in the afternoon of the day before we were going to leave my Uncle Jimmy 's castle to start out on our way home  --  that he came up to me , all alone , in the front hall , and said , " How 's it going ? " " Good , " I said . " Just swell . " He looked at me for a couple of seconds without saying anything , and I was afraid that somehow he had found out and was going to say something about what I had done , but instead all he said was , " I thought you were looking a little thin in the face these days , that 's all . However . . . you 're not too sorry to be going home ? " " No , " I said . " I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would miss James and Charles and especially Phil , and that I would even miss my Uncle Jimmy and my Aunt Mary . But I was glad to be going back with my father after such a long time away from home . I wanted more every day to see our house again , and to be in it , and to see Ellen and of course Arthur and to tell them all the things that had happened to me since I had been away . My father nodded . " All right , " he said . " I just wanted to know.  |p107Make  sure you 're all packed by tonight , now , because we want to leave first thing in the morning . " So I played the rest of the day with my three cousins , and that night after dinner my Aunt Mary came up to my room and helped Phil and me pack all my things . Then James and Charles came in to see me and to give me going-away presents , which turned out to be things they already owned themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex- " but we could n't find anything . They do n't have verygood stores to buy things in over here . " " Except sweaters and belts and junk like that , " Charles said . " And they 're not presents because you get them anyway . " So Charles gave me his best model airplane , and James gave me a big leather wallet which had his initials stamped on it in gold , but that was all right because luckily they were my initials , too . " Actually , " James said , handing the wallet to me , " it 's a better present than it looks because I think it 's made out of quite rare leather . You can tell that when you feel it . " So I felt it , and then I thanked them both , and after this Phil gave me his present , which was the best of all : it was the crystal set that he had made himself . " When you get home , " he said , " you 'll be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell radio ! " I thanked him , too , and then we all talked for a while , and pretty soon , because we all had to get up very early on account of my going , James and Charles left and Phil and I got ready for bed . We did n't go to sleep for a long time , though . We stayed awake in our beds , talking about the good times we had had this summer , and remembering some of the funny things that had happened to all of us , and guessing about what we would do now when we got home . Phil did n't know exactly where he would be , because my Uncle Jimmy had a couple of houses in different partsp108of the country and he had n't made up his mind which one he was going to yet . But wherever he went , Phil and I agreed that we would fix it so that we would still see each other a lot , and it was after talking about this for a few minutes that Phil said maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned on the table light , and on a piece of letter paper we found we made up a Pact . It went : A PACT betweenTHE FIERCE AND FRIENDLY TWO(1) We will stay friends our whole lives no matter what happens. ( 2 ) No matter how far away we are we will meet each other at least three times a year and probably a lot more. ( 3 ) If anyone harms or wounds either one of us the other one will revengehim . We signed this and made a copy of it and signed that too , so that we each could have one , and then we went back to bed . Phil went to sleep almost right away after this , and even though I was still excited about going home and everything , in a little while I did , too . The next morning , very early , we all had breakfast , and then my father and I went out to the little car that we had come to the castle in a couple of months ago , but that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put in , so we just said goodbye to everybody once more , my Aunt Mary kissed me and cried a little , and my Uncle Jimmy gave me a hard handshake and said , " Stay in there swinging , Jackie ! Do n't let us down ! I 'll be watchingyou all the time ! And remember : no baloney ! " I promised him that there would be no baloney , and he nodded and walked over to my father and began to say something to him in a low voice . I shook hands with James and Charles and Phil ,  |p109and  then I got into the car , with my father getting in beside me in the driver 's seat . " All set , " he said . Then he waved , and I did too , and we drove off down the big circular driveway . The sun was pretty far up now , there was a little mist coming over the pond , some birds were singing , and it was another good day . As we reached almost the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three boys waved at me , and we all kept waving until I could n't see them any more . We rode through the country , not the way we had come but more to the south , to where we could catch the boat for home . My father did n't talk much on this ride either , but every once in a while he would ask me some questions about how I had liked this or that at my Uncle Jimmy 's , and I would answer him and tell him about how much fun we had had , and about all the things we did , and about how of all the boys I liked Phil the best . I did n't tell him anything about the Pact , because that was supposed to be just between Phil and me . He did n't say anything , ever , about his talk that night with my Uncle Jimmy , and of course I did n't , either . But now and then , after driving a long time without saying anything , he would just reach out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck and muss my hair the way he always did . And I felt good , because even though I missed the boys some already , it was still fine to be driving along here and to be alone with my father again . We got on the boat and started on our way back to America . It was all very much like our trip coming over : our cabin was almost the same , and the ride was very smooth , with no big storms to bother us . My father still stayed mainly in the cabin , reading or smoking , and I went all over the ship by myself , sometimes talking with other passengers , sometimes going up with some of the officers , who let me watch the way they ran the ship , and sometimesplaying with other boys I met on board . I ate all my mealsp110except breakfast with my father , though , and at night we were always together , talking about the different things we always talked about . Then one night  --  it was the night before we landed  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about the house and Ellen and Arthur , and suddenly I thought my father was looking a little sad  --  or maybe not sad so much as far-off , as if while he was talking to me here he were really thinking about something else . We went on talking , and pretty soon he said , " Let me ask you a question : do you know anything about boarding schools ? " " Not very much , " I said . " Hardly anything . " " Any of your friends ever go to one ? " he said . " Only Charlie Hughes , " I said . " His father and mother took him out of our school last year and sent him away to one . " " And did Charlie like it there ? " my father said . " At first he hated it , " I said . " But now he likes it okay . Why ? " " No special reason , " my father said . " It 's just one of those things you happen to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to talk about something else , and we did n't come back to the boarding school subject again . And I did n't know  --  I guess maybe I could n't have known  --  that something terribly important to me and to what I was going to do had just been said . One month later , I went away to boarding school . For the first time in my life I was away from everybody I had always known , for the first time I was with nobody but strangers : strange boys , strange teachers , in a world that was completely strange to me . And with that the whole first part of my boyhood  --  my childhood , really : the happy time spent with my father and mother and Tom and Ellen and Arthur  --  came to an end forever , and I began what I suppose was the business of growing up.  |p113ON  the first Tuesday of November , my cousin Charles was elected governor of the state . His election came as a surprise to many : I think perhaps to most . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day the bishop of our diocese  --  a shrewd , ancient crag of a man , circumspect almost to the point of meaninglessness in public speech , blunt as a club in private  --  reportedly had said , " I 've known Jimmy Kinsella all my life . And his sister Gert . It 's been my experience that they usually get what they go after . This boy is just like them . They try to tell you he is n't , but he is . So I think he 'll be governor . One way or another . Matter of fact , I think if he wanted to be one of the Trinity he might make it . " This was the bishop ; it was a minority opinion . For the rest , Charles was a possibility , no more . And so when he won there was at first the surprise , but then , once the victory had been established as official , and once hindsight had been given its usual chance , there was common agreement that he had won easily , indeed almost without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the political amateur  --  the voter  --  but it was not without professional support . One of Charles 's more conspicuous aides  --  from the practical(politician) rather than the theoretical ( professor ) wing : he had both  --  said comfortably , " A piece of cake . He had it all the way . "  |p114Had  Charles believed this ? I doubt it ; he was far from being an optimist , and he was seldom casual about what concerned him most . Certainly from all I could learn  --  and this was largely at second hand , from the reports of others : I had been away from the city for a long time , and had come back just before the election  --  therehad been nothing in the least casual about his campaign . It had been meticulously planned and tirelessly conducted ; more to the point , it had been extremely expensive . Like many men with money , Charles was a guarded spender , yet suddenly in the campaign there had appeared that long string of ads , terse but full-page ( " Integrity : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leadership : KINSELLA ! " ) . There had been the billboards , springing up to border superhighways ( same message ) , the radio jingles , the banners , the posters , the bumper stickers by the thousands . And there had been television . It was on television that Charles had come into his own . The rest  --  the ads , the signs , the jingles  --  were faultless but routine : no candidate in his right mind would have come before this particular electorate without that magical " Leadership . " But television , for Charles , was something different . It was as if he had recognized at once that this newest route to the public belonged to him in the same way that the torchlight parade had belonged to older and earlier men . He had used it well . He was photogenic ; his speech , casual , rather spare , and unremarkable in a ball park or an auditorium , was curiously impressive on this intimate medium : it became almost imperative to believe that he believed in whatever he was saying . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final week of his campaign , but I discovered that he had been appearing regularly and very often from the beginning , and that each appearance had been prepared and filmed in advance by a team of experts brought in from the outside . As a candidate Charles had naturally come out strong for all local industry , but as a prudent man he had excepted television . The local brand was abundant but unsteady , vacillating between the competent andp115the bizarre ; Charles , who liked to be sure , had decided to import reliability . None of this had been free : he had spent hard . And he had worked hard . Little known in the small towns and the rural areas , he had set out to become known . Motorcades had crisscrossed the state daily ; Charles had led them all , in rain or shine marvelously visible in the long open Cadillac : very tall ( six feet three ) , light red hair and dark blue eyes , the long and rather watchful face smiling slightly , one hand raised and occasionally dipping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opponent , Charles was not by temperament a waver ; it was only for the smallest fraction of his life that he had been saluting  --  in this or any other way  --  crowds of total strangers . ) In this personal approach to the voters he had refused to deputize . The result had been a schedule which must have been punishing and which had in no way suggested overconfidence . He won . Perhaps it was the size of the victory rather than the victory itself which surprised so many , for he had always been given that outside chance . His opponent , the incumbent governor , was a formidable politician and deeply entrenched in office , but on balance Charles was at least a respectable candidate . He had the liability of his limited experience  --  one four-year term as mayor of the capital city  --  but against that he offered certain strengths . He was young  --  thirty-nine , intelligent , attractive , ethnically correct . He was a Democrat  --  far rarer for us , a Democrat untouched by scandal . Thanks to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who had managed to avoid the dislikeof other women . His political record , though short , was good : as mayor he had started cautiously , but firmness had come fast , and in City Hall circles there had even been complaints that his tactics were unfair . " I 've got only the one rule when I shake hands with the mayor , " one veteran city councilman was alleged to have said , " and that is to keep the iron jock on at all times . "  |p116Im|perfect  protection , apparently : the councilman had been in jail when he said it . But whether merited or not , these grumbles seemed not to have damaged Charles . By the end of his term he had drawn praise and  --  far better  --  support from groups which did not otherwise agree . He was a fresh face on a tired scene ; his image , as they say , was good . Moreover  --  although this was perhaps not widely recognized at the time  --  he had the luck which those who are destined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the campaign , the governor  --  a persuasive Italian confidence man , currently working as a New Republican  --  made the first really serious mistake of a long and uncannily surefootedcareer : he trusted an ally . Incredibly , he wrote a letter which no one a week in politics would have written ; worse , he signed it . There was an argument ; bitterness flashed , persisted ; old cronies fell out ; the letter was produced and made public . There were threats of investigation ; the governor howled forgery ; and Charles  --  Charles worked harder and spent more . The New Republicanwas buried ; Charles won by the largest plurality ever recorded in the state . I saw him on the night following his election . There was a victoryparty ; I had been invited . It was a gesture pleasantly , perhaps even automatically , extended to a relative , for while Charles and I had always been friendly and once had even been fairly close  --  although never as close as , say , Phil and I had been  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met it was casually , agreeably , and not very often . There had been no quarrel , no formal break of any kind : simply a gradual and probably inevitable growing apart . There had been marriage , new demands , new friendships ; our work was different and so were most of our interests ; and Charles , with his now very considerable income , lived and moved on a scale far more luxurious than mine  --  there had even been a brief period of glamour when he and Marie had figured in the gossip columns as minor members of the internationalset . In all of this I had had no part  --  just as , later , I had hadp117no part in his political rise . I had written no speeches , made no broadcasts , pushed no doorbells ; I had not raised funds . I had given him the support of my vote : that was all . And never once , not even at the very beginning , did he even suggest that I might help him in any other way . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had said to me one night , with no preliminary , " Jack , I 'll give you something you have n't heard before : Charles is going to run for mayor . " This had been five years ago , at a time when no one even dreamed of anything like this for Charles  --  no one , that is , except his brothers and my Uncle Jimmy . And , of course , Charles himself . The family cohesiveness had grown with the years , and they took few steps without a family council . They did not surprise each other . But as for me , if I had been told that Charles was shortly to become an astronaut , or that he was soon to produce a fresh translation of Proust , I think I would have been less astonished . For there had never been any connection between Charles and politics of any kind  --  let alone our local variety . The city had been his birthplace and had remained his home base , but he had always been away from it more than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest interest in its operation . I remembered this for a particular reason , because years ago , shortly after leaving college , I had been in and around City Hall for a brief period myself . The old mayor of the city , Frank Skeffington , had always shown great friendliness toward my father  --  in a sense this was odd , because I do n't believe they knew each other well , and there had certainly been no professional tie : my father , who frequently forgot to vote , would have been a poor political worker  --  and it was undoubtedly due to this that one day , out of the blue , he had called me to his office and asked me if I would care to become his secretary . It had been a flattering offer ; I had at that time no definiteplans of my own ; I had been curious ; I had accepted in an instant . I had been the last of his secretaries to be employed by this extraordinary old man before his death . Necessarily , through him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember thatp118occasionally I had talked to Charles about what went on in that shabby , sordid , hilarious place . I remembered too that while he had sometimes been amused by these stories , more often , I think , he had been a little bored . Because it was not his world : it was simply not his world at all . And now , suddenly , it was . He had decided to join it , and more than that , he had decided to join it as its chief . It was not a modest proposal . On the night that he had told me this , Phil and I had been sitting , very late , in a nearly deserted and very bad restaurant . It had been a Sunday at the end of the summer ; my wife and I had been spending a weekend with Phil and his family at their place on the island . At the last moment Jean had decided to stay on for a few more days , and so I had driven back to the city alone with Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in heavy Thruway traffic , and by the time we reached the city Phil was ready to stop for food before going home . Because of the hour and the day few places were open , and in the end we had gone to an all-night cafeteria . I remember very clearly Phil sitting there opposite me , rapidly eating thick pancakes soaked in a thin imitation-maple syrup . " Yum yum , " he said dryly . " This is where all the truck drivers eat . I guess we can believe that , hey ? " I remember that the only other customers were four deaf-mutes , seated a few tables away , conducting what appeared to be an agitated conversation in their speedy pantomime . The counterman had pointed them out to us when we had given our orders . " They 's dumbos , " he had said . I remember exactly how Phil looked , what he was wearing : a light tan tropical worsted which he called his Hong Kong suit , and for which he claimed to have paid eleven dollars and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orient the previous winter . It was a strange suit : fresh from the iron it was handsome , worn for an hour it was wrinkled rubbish . According to Phil it was a unique fabric of Chinese invention.  | " Half wool , half Kleenex , " he had said . " They saw me coming . " And on that night , listening to him as he told me the surprising news about Charles , looking at the tall body bending slightly forward as he told me , and seeing the dark blue eyes in the bony intelligent face watching me with amusement at my surprise , I remember that I had felt a fleeting but curious sensation : it was as though I were not only listening to talk about Charles , but that it was really Charles himself who was doing the talking . It was the sort of thing that had happened to me before with the two brothers , a special kind of momentary confusion , and I knew that others had felt this , too . For Charles and Phil , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like each other , and now , although the resemblance was hardly breathtaking , still it was close enough so that strangers  --  or those who did not know that Charles was a year or so younger  --  normally assumed that the two were twins . Neither had James 's elegance , his peculiar distinction of appearance , but they had their own good looks  --  Charles in particular had come a long way : the little fat boy with the glasses had been left far behind , vanishing forever during one six-month period somewhere in his middle teens  --  and with their height and slimness and red hair and blue eyes , they were extraordinary-lookingmen , in no danger of being passed by . An old man I know once said to me , " By God , Jack , you 'd look at them even if they were poor ! " Apart from their looks they were not much alike , and yet there were those moments when something seemed to happen , to click and to connect the two in some mysterious subsurface way , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just a second or two there was likely to be a flash of uncertainty , a sense of bafflement among even those who knew them well . This moment always passed quickly , an oddity which was never fully explained or understood , because in fact we knew  --  or I knew  --  that the two were really poles apart . I had said , " Charles ? "  |p120He  had nodded . " Charles . " He was serious ; I could tell that . I said , " That 's a strange one : does anyone actually think he has a chance ? " " Sure , " Phil had said . " I do . James does . Pa does . And then of course there 's Charles . Does that sound arrogant ? I guess it does . I guess it is . But anyway , here 's the main thing : want to hop on board ? We have a few vacancies at the moment . " " I 'll bet you have . " " What do you say , Jack ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Charles would too . You know that . " I shook my head . " No thanks . I 've been to the zoo . I 've had it . " " That was a long time ago . Stone Age stuff . This is going to be different . " " No , it 's not . And I 'll tell you why . " And then , for a few minutes while he listened with surprising patience  --  because he was essentially a talker rather than a listener  --  Ihad talked from the only platform I could : that of my own short political experience . I talked about the small , inbred , incrediblycomplicated world of the local politician , about the practicalexperience needed even to begin to spar with those soiled but crafty veterans , about the scars , the dirt , the damage that would inevitably come from the kind of campaign that would inevitably be fought , about the difficulty of changing or affecting the ancient , massive , corrupt and rusted machinery of the city 's government , about the impossibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it , Phil . He 's bright , he 's honest , he 's a good lawyer , but that 's not enough . He 's rich and he 's Jimmy Kinsella 's boy  --  that 's better , but even that 's not enough . He 'll get slaughtered ; he wo n't get past the primaries . They just wo n't let him in . " And Phil had laughed . He seemed in the best of spirits , as if he had enjoyed my bleak recitation and indeed had expected it . " Good for you , Jack , " he said . " It 's all true , every word of it . Exceptfor one thing : it does n't matter . It really does n't . Not anyp121more . Oh I know , I know , " he said , " you think it does because it always has : Big Dad Skeffington and all that hoo-ha . But no more ; it 's all different now . Or it 's going to be . Because we 're not going to wait for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if we have to blast . We 're going in and we 're going to take it away from them and they wo n't even know what hit them until it 's all over . " He leaned toward me , a familiar look in his eye : it was boyish and bold and merry , a look he 'd had ever since he was small , ever since I 'd known him  --  at this moment I could never have mistaken him for Charles or for anyone else . " Oh come on ! " he said eagerly . " They 're such a scaly bunch : let 's take it all away from them and drive them back under the ground or wherever they came from . We can do it . This whole place is aching for something new . Come on , jack , and we 'll have a ball . What do you say ? It 'll be great fun ! " He was off and running ; he was describing an exciting game . I said , " Just for kicks ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more soberly . " A little principle got mixed up in it somewhere  --  I tried to stop it , but it did . You see , I know the wicked flourish and all that ; what kills me is the really crummy grade of wicked who flourish around here . This gang of shanty clowns has been playing the city like a slot machine for years . You ca n't sit still for that forever , can you ? It 's humiliating . It 's like being goosed by the garbage man every day ! " " And you think Charles is going to change all that ? Incidentally , why Charles ? I mean , of all of you ? " " He was the logical one , " he said . " Always supposing it had to be one of us . And I guess it did  --  anyway , it was our idea and we 're running the show . But Pa 's too old and too busy , and James obviously could n't do it , and I did n't want to  --  to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " " How did he do that ? Was there an acceptance speech ? Did he say , All right , it 's settled : I 'll be the mayor . I think we 're all agreed that I want to be ' ? "  |p122Phil  laughed again . " No , it was n't much like that . You might say he had the honor thrust upon him . You might also say that we did n't have to thrust very hard . But that 's all right . You have n't seen much of Charles lately , have you ? He might surprise you , jack . He 's really pretty good . " " You 'd know about that better than I would . You both work the same side of the street . " " No , I do n't mean as a lawyer . Good lawyers are a dime a dozen . He 's something else  --  or he 's getting to be something else . At least it seems that way to me . There have been times lately when Charles has impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? " He gestured vaguely . " Just generally . He 's a very cool customer , you know . And he knows how to handle himself  --  in a way he 's like Pa . Only with manners . Anyway , think it over . I wish you 'd come along . " " Well , thanks , but I do n't think so . I 'll give Charles a ring and wish him luck . And if there 's anything special or occasional he needs , all right . If I can help , I will . But I do n't want to get in on the whole picture . Once was enough . And I do n't think this is going to be all that different . I know you want to make it different , but I do n't think you can . And I do n't think Charles can . I just do n't think he 's the answer . " He did n't say anything to this ; I looked at him and then , puzzled  --  because , after all , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you do , do n't you ? " He nodded . He pushed his plate away from him , and as he did a thin trail of the fake maple syrup dribbled down across the table , and a few drops fell onto the pants of his Hong Kong suit ; he did n't bother to blot them up . The restaurant was now strangely quiet . No further customers had come in out of the hot night ; up behind the rows of fruit cups and butterscotch cookies and plates of cold pale meat the counterman diverted himself by balancing a floor mop on the end of a forefinger ; at the corner table the mutes continued to sip iced coffee and to sustain theirp123furious still eloquence . The only sound I could hear was the troubled whining of the air-conditioning . Phil stopped nodding and said , " I guess I do . I guess I even think that Charles might be the answer to a lot of things . That 's kind of funny , is n't it ? But I do . I really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm ready if you are , " he said . " I find as I get older than I need that good , solid , one hour 's sleep . Is n't that what you find ? " We left the restaurant , and he drove me home . And that was the way I first heard that Charles was considering a political career . And now , five years later , I was driving through the city on my way to the governor 's house.  |p124MORE  than a year before he entered his first political campaign , Charles had made a necessary preliminary move : he had established firmly and unmistakably the fact of his legal residence . He had moved from his apartment  --  which he and Marie and their three children had used as a headquarters whenever they happened to be in the city  --  and had bought a private house . The apartment had been pleasant but cramped , and also , in a curious way and despite its years of use , somehow impermanent , as if it were a high-rent bivouac ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn and was undoubtedly here to stay . It was the old Burroughs house : an impressive , gloomily handsome Georgian mansion , tree-shadowed and built like a fort . When I was a boy I had often bicycled by this house , and peeping in through the tall hedge , I had sometimes caught a glimpse of Amy Burroughs  --  who seemed ancient even then  --  tottering slowly across the lawn , her long purple dress brushing the tops of the grass , her cane poking the earth ahead of her , while behind trailed a vast and spreading retinue of cats . She was the last of her family ; they were now popularly believed to have been old-line aristocrats of faultless pedigree , but this was not true . Her grandfather had in fact been a druggist , who after protesting violently had been dragged off to the Civil War , from which he had emerged as ap125captain , and then had gone on to make a fortune in nose drops of his own invention . It was he who had built the house , which for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name had died with the captain , the house had acquired a somber majesty over the years , and Charles owned it now . And now , tonight , this old house , where lonely , palsied Amy Burroughs had never entertained , and where Charles and Marie had given only their small and rather elegant dinners  --  tonight it was breaking with its tradition of seclusion , and it was breaking with a bang . It was wide open , literally , for the night was very warm  --  Indian summer , the last gasp  --  and the celebration had reached out onto the deep green lawn where tables had been set up , gay with paper lanterns . It was light and loud and festive , and through the open windows music sprang into the still night air ; coming toward the house I had heard it blocks away . I arrived late , but even so the traffic jam near the house had not broken . The section in which Charles lived was one of wide , pleasantly curving , carefully patrolled streets , and these were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than inch along . For a moment I thought that the official party had overflowedinto the streets , but then I realized that the crowd out here was entirely different : they were sightseers rather than invited guests , they were mostly young people who were eager for a glimpse of the new young governor at play . Charles had great strength among the students ; there were half a dozen colleges in or near the city , and it seemed that they all had representatives here tonight . I drove through them very carefully ; the police were on hand but had little to do , for this was a friendly crowd : they had come to cheer . Many of them seemed too young to vote  --  I 'm sure they were . There were boys and girls dancing on the sidewalk to the music of a portable radio ; under one of the simulated gas lamps which illuminated this district a well-dressed young man with a guitar was singing the song of a depressed worker ; others were cheering and beating rhythmically with their hands and call/ing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was only one dissident note : a tall elderly tattered man wearing sneakers and a World War I overseas cap stood on the curb , facingCharles 's house and waving his arms ; he was shouting , " I hope it thunders and lightnings and rains like the hammers of hell , Charles Kinsella , all over you and your damn garden party ! " This was greeted with loud mock cheers and hurrahs which seemed to further enrage the old man . The police watched , but did not interfere . Finally I got through enough of the crowd so that I was opposite the driveway . A state trooper  --  symbol of Charles 's new station  --  requested identification ; I showed my invitation , and while I was not recognized , my last name of course was . The magic " Kinsella " whisked me , with another state trooper as escort , to a preferredparking space at the edge of the lawn . The state trooper looked as young as some of the students ; he jumped down and held my car door open for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of us , sir . Your brother 's a wonderful man . He 's really wonderful ! A great man to travel around with . Very very considerate ! " " My cousin , " I said . " Oh , " he said . His interest diminished , but did not disappear . I walked toward the house across the lawn , stepping among the tables , occasionally stopping to talk as I recognized a face in the lantern light . At last I reached the house and went in . It was crowded and very noisy , for while many of the guests had gone outside , the main body of the party had preferred to remain indoors  --  nearthe food , the liquor , the music , and of course , near Charles . They were gathered mostly in the great long room to the right of the front hall . This had been the old ballroom  --  question : had Amy Burroughs ever danced ?  --  and I had seen it once many years before : it had been formal and forbidding , massive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Marie 's touch . As I entered , the orchestra was playing and a chunkyp127blonde girl was singing the simple dreadful song that had accompaniedCharles everywhere throughout the campaign : Kinsella ! Kinsella ! He 's the man for me ! Kinsella ! Kinsella ! It 's on to victory ! He 's marching marching marching to the governor 's chair . Goodbye corruption : Kinsella 's on the square ... I saw Charles ; he was surrounded , on the far side of the room . They were laughing , he was smiling . A heavy perspiring man in a very blue tuxedo came up to me , a plate of food in his hand ; he said , " Correct me if I 'm wrong , but you 're the Governor 's brother , right ? " " His cousin , " I said . " Good for you ! " he said promptly . " You 've got a real sweetheartthere ! " With his free hand he tapped the plate of food . " Lobster ! " he said . " That 's the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He grabbed the coat of a man who was about to pass without seeing him ; the man stopped , turned , and delightedly called , " Edso ! Whaddaya say ? " He was very small and very thin , with yellowish eyes and an astonishing set of false teeth which were much too large for his little face ; he could hardly have looked less like the man who had stopped him , yet somehow there was a resemblance so strong it was remarkable . " Happy days are here again ! " Edso said . " Walshie , say hello top128the Governor 's cousin , who 's a top-notcher in his own right . Let me see now , the first name is Ralph , am I right on that ? " I corrected him ; he accepted the correction joyously . " Jack ! " he cried . " Of course it 's Jack ! Do n't tell me I forgot that ! What the hell am I thinking of : it 's a name I know as well as I know my own ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ritual answers ; I said , " Fine , fine . " " You 're doing a great job there , " he said vaguely . For a moment I wondered what would happen if suddenly I asked just what job it was that I was doing so well , but then of course I knew what would happen : nothing . The question would have been resented as being deeply unfair and antisocial . He said , " Jimmy 's your uncle then , am I right on that ? " I said that he was right , and Walshie said , " God bless Jimmy . He 's a credit to his people and someone the whole country can be proud of . He was always a good friend to me . And God bless the Governor and his lovely wife as well . You can tell him I said that , Jack . You can tell him it came right from the heart ! " " Right from the heart of a man that 's looked death in the face and licked it ! " Edso said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor while you 're at it , Jack . Do n't forget to mention that one of his very top campaign workers , Leo J. Walsh , got up off his ass and licked the deadliest enemy of modern times : cancer of the bowels ! " " After all the finest doctors at the Mother Cabrini Hospital had given me up for dead , " Walshie said . " I fooled them all ! " " I tell you , whenever I hear a story like that , " said Edso , speakingwith difficulty , for his mouth was now full of food ; he had resumed his eating from the plate he was carrying about with him , " I feel like saying a little prayer . Walshie , did you get any of this lobster ? It 's positively the greatest ! " Walshie said that he had , and that in fact he was now on his way back to the buffet table for seconds . By God , a man thatp129serves food like this ca n't help but be a great governor , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I always say you can tell a man by the food he serves . Nothin ' kills a man faster than servin ' bum food . Look at Dan Cohalan . D'ye remember him , Edso ? Down at the Department of Health ? " " Big Dan , " Edso said . " With the cockeye . Retired now on a three-quarter pension . " " That 's him , " Walshie said . " Well , one time he decided to go for the City Council , so he gave a little party for himself over in the old Shore Gardens Hotel that 's now the parkin ' lot . Everybodywas there , you know , and pretty soon Dan comes edgin ' over to me and he says , Well , Walshie , how does it look from where you sit ? ' I says to him , I says , Dan , I got to tell you the truth : you 're all done . You have n't got a Chinaman 's chance . After servin ' food like this you could n't get elected dog-catcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high horse , you know , and he says , What the hell 's wrong with this food ? The trouble with you is you do n't know classy food when you see it ! You prob'ly think this is creamed chicken ! Well , I 'll tell you what this is : it 's genuine creamed capon , that 's what it is ! " It is , is it ? ' I says . Then it 's a damn funny kind of capon , that 's all I 've got to say . And if you want to know what I think , I think it 's the kind of capon they spell s-e-a g-u-1-1 ! ' " Good for you , Walshie ! " Edso said . " Right smack on the button : it served him damn well right ! " He now decided to join Walshie in the search for seconds ; they left together , with Edso winking a broad farewell at me , and punching me playfully on the arm as they moved away . " Over the river ! " he said jauntily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be sure you tell him that Edso Monahan is behind him all the way ! " I watched them go off into the crowd , Edso 's blue tuxedo servingas a vivid , inescapable marker . I had never seen either of themp130before , but I felt as if I had known them forever and had heard this conversation a thousand times before . The time was the present , the scene had changed , but it was obvious that certain great constants in the political life of the city remained . I wondered exactly how Charles fitted Edso and Walshie into his announced program of the New Look in Government . Looking across the room once more I could see that Charles was still standing on the far side of the room , his position unchanged , and still surrounded . Just at this moment , however , he looked up and over in my direction , and from the quick smile and the slight beckoning movement of his head I knew that he had seen me . I began to move toward him , but progress was slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have come into this room , which was already unpleasantly crowded . They must have come in from the lawn : possibly because a night wind had come up , possibly because they sensed that at any moment now the Governor would speak . It was out of the question to move in any straight path ; I tacked my way back and forth among swirling groups of people , and as I did so I noticed for the first time the peculiar nature of this gathering . It was not like the old political crowd  --  not at all . It was noisy , happy , even jubilant , but it was not a crowd . It was , instead , a large grouping of independent knots ; walking through them , I saw that although the pressure of too many people in too small a space had forced these knots together , each knot had a life of its own and did not mix readily with its neighbor . They were adjacent islands , not a continent  --  the tie was Charles and that was all . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly , most I did not know at all . As I edged my way through them and past them I paused at times to exchange a shouted word , but for the most part I just moved along , and as I did so my pace was so slow and the voices were so loud that for moments I would seem stalled in the middle of a conversation in which I had no part , and every word I overheardp131seemed to emphasize still further the heterogeneousness of Charles 's support .. . " ... we flew up yesterday morning , Nick stayed behind to come up with Davy , but that did n't matter because he could n't vote anyway . " " What 's the matter with Nick ? Not registered ? " " Sweet , he has n't registered for ages . Not since we bought the place on Cat Key . We 're there all the time , we never see anyone any more . Of course it 's an absolute dream , but who wants to be stuck there forever ? But it 's all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he comes to write to Archie Tolliver . Archie has an arrangement in Switzerland which is practically bomb-proof as far as the IRS is concerned . It might be just the thing for you , " " I doubt it . Nick loathes Switzerland and I 'm not mad about it either . I thought I might ask Charles : he 's always so clever . And of course now he 's in a position to help , is n't he . . . ? " " ... you 're attempting to tell me that alienation was n't a factorin this election ? Is that what you 're attempting to tell me ? " " I 'm not attempting to tell you anything . Why should I attempt to tell you a single word ? You 've got your own personal dialectic , anybody who does n't agree one hundred per cent is automatically a schmo . So all right , I 'm a schmo . Why should a schmo attempt to tell you anything ? " " You 're a very resentful person , Bernie . The pathetic thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believe me , you could use some help . You could use a lot of help .... " " Please , fellas . We won , right ? So stop arguing ... . . . five hundred bucks a plate . A heavy tab , but a sellout from the word go . I 'll tell you who the toastmaster was : Fatherp132Artie McGuire . You know ? From the Hill ? He 's just back from Rome . Vatican Council . He did a hell of a job . A million laughs , but something you could take home with you , too . Frank Regan got him for us . " " There 's the boy that 's loaded these days . Frank Regan . He 's got nothing but money . Wall-to-wall . They say he 's got all Jimmy Kinsella 's insurance . " " And the boys ' as well . A real shrewdie , Frank . And JoJo 's up for the Federal bench . That 's not bad , either . " " The only judge in the state who ca n't spell attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was damn near indicted on that finder 's fee business . Georgetown , is n't he ? " " The Cross . . . . " " liar har har ! Hey , Guido . . . 1 " " .. a fair student , no more . I remember a long paper he wrote on Charles James Fox . Not good , not really bad  --  just undistinguished . That was typical of all his work . " " Yes . I always thought the older brother was the brighter of the two . " " Phil , yes . I had them both ; I would n't have picked either of them to do much of anything . Two more rich boys who did just enough to slide by , and why bother to do anything more ? No , Charles is a great surprise to me . And a very welcome one . You see , what no one could have predicted was the growth . He 's liberal , he 's open-minded , he works hard at all the right things . And he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found him very impressive all through the campaign . " " No reservations ? I must say I 'm not entirely happy about that Inner Guard . " " The ex-altar boy types , yes . I agree . But I think they 're more a concession to the father than anything else . Charles is something else again . He 's not an intellectual , despite all the claims . But hep133has a respect for those who are ; I find him extremely sympathetic . I think you 'll find that as time goes on a certain amount of jettisoning will be done , and that you 'll be much happier with the replacements . I think that 's inevitable ... , " " . . . so I said , You fired this waiter . Why ? ' He said , Becausehe 's not a good waiter any more . He mixes thing up , he drops things , he upsets the dining room . ' I said , Okay . Now : was he ever drunk on duty ? ' He said , No : I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad words to customers ? Did he insult them ? ' He said , ' No , he did n't do that . ' So I said , Okay . Then I 'll tell you what 's gon na happen . You 're gon na hire this man back as of now , or else I pull him and everybody else out of this hotel by tomorrow morning , and when all your fancy guests wake up there wo n't be a waiter or a maid or a bellhop in the joint . So make up your mind ( ' So they hire him back . They had to . What else could they do ? " " Do n't tell that to the Governor . He stays in that hotel lots of times . " " Yeah ? Well , maybe he should start stayin ' in another hotel ... " .. trust him ? That 's what I 'm asking you right here and now : what makes you so sure you can trust him ? " " And once again I answer you : I would rather trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands ? You think a rich white man with a million dollars in the bank , you think he even begins to under-stand ? " " I think if we supported only those who understood , we would support nobody . This is a practical situation , it is a situation of relatives , it is not a situation of absolutes . If you ask two men , ' Have we here de facto segregation ? ' and the one man says , No , we do not have de facto segregation , ' and the other man says , Yes ,  |p134we  do have de facto segregation and it is a bad thing which I promise to do something about , ' then it is not a question of absolute trust or of absolute anything but of accepting the better of the two . . . . " And all this was a long long way from those shouting , cheering , unified throngs of only a few years ago , which as much as anything else , I suppose , were in reality clan rallies honoring the chief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and intellectual forces which would have been unthinkable behind any one candidatethen , and while I had suspected something of this , it was not until I saw the victory party in action that I realized how effectively Charles had cut across the old established lines . So that while the old remained , something new had been added ; Edso and Walshie were but a part of a far more complicated spectrum . The orchestra had continued to play without interruption ; directly in front of the musicians a space was being used as a dance floor , but this was pure farce ; any sort of rhythmic movement was impossible . The curtains at the sides of the long open French windows began to blow in strongly as suddenly and blessedly the cooler air came into the room . I was close to where Charles had been standing , but now he was no longer there ; looking around , I could n't see him anywhere . Congratulations would have to wait . Still , I kept moving forward slowly  --  it was as good a direction as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles had been , a hand touched my arm , tapping it twice , and when I turned I saw Marie . " Charles was looking for you , " she said . " I have a message to give you . " It was a gracious and rather formal statement ; I knew that it had been meant not for me , but for the women to whom she had been talking . They were together in a clump , rather alike in appearance : in late middle age they were pale and fat-featured and laughed a lot . I knew that they were the wives of heavy con/tributors ; for their part they would have given " at homes " and " bridge benefits " throughout the campaign . " Will you excuse me ? " Marie said to them now . " Just for a minute ? More family busi-ness . " She smiled at them ; they laughed back ; they laughed at me : I was lucky , I was family . Marie took my hand and led me a short distance across the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the crowd parted to allow her smiling passage . We got to a small alcove off the main room where , surprisingly , there were only three or four others , and where , even more surprisingly , the sound from the main room was somehow diminished , so that for a moment I had the impression of being in a place of great and sudden silence . " No message , " she said . " I just wanted a breather . How goes life , Jack ? Is n't this a great night ? " She was a big woman , but not in the least bulky or buxom : she was just big and smooth and beautifully made . She was very fair , with large smoky-gray eyes and a full attractive mouth ; her skin was marvelously clear and fresh and her hair was so blonde that when Jean had first seen it she had declared that it could n't possibly be natural  --  and yet I think it was . There was something in her appearance which suggested the outdoor girl , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and in fact that was much closer to the truth . She was very much an indoor girl , she was not fond of golf or tennis or riding or long brisk walks in the country . She paid close attention to her appearance and had a great sense of style  --  she was one of the bestdressedwomen I had ever seen . Charles was reported to have said , just before the election , that he considered the greatest contribution to his campaign to have been made by Givenchy . Men found her very attractive and yet , as I 've said , women liked her too . I think this may have been because she treated them not with mere politeness , but with a genuine friendliness . She liked people to like her , and while she had her party manner , she had ap136great naturalness too , and this kept breaking through . I had not known her before her marriage to Charles  --  indeed , who had ?  --  but I liked her from the first , and I think that she liked me . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . She said to me now , without waiting for an answer to her other questions , " How about it , Jack ? Am I your first First Lady ? " " I met a queen once , but I 'm not sure she counts . She 'd been deposed for quite a while , and I guess she had n't been much of a queen anyway . Besides , she was old and limped and had one eye . So I much prefer you . How are you bearing up ? " " Oh , you know me . I love it . Or most of it . It 's exciting and wonderful  --  Jack , nobody ever won by such a margin before : did you know that ? " " Oh , I did indeed . There 's not a loose marble left in the state ; Charles has them all today . " " He has , has n't he ? " she said happily . " And the great thing is that nobody thought he could do it . Or almost nobody . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you ? " I shook my head . " I thought he 'd carry the city easily enough , but I was sure Consolo would have too much strength up north . Not to cop a plea , but remember I 'd been away . " " Well , when you got back you should have come to me , " she said . " I 'd have set you straight in a minute . " She was a strong partisan of her husband and could be rather chilly with any of his friends or acquaintances who gave him less than all-out support , yet for some reason I had always been saved from this . Maybe it was because I was a relative for whom special rules applied , maybe it was because Charles himself had never seemed to mind in the least that I had n't worked for him , or maybe it was simply because she knew that I really liked him  --  at any rate , all she said now was , " Poor Consolo . Or no , not poor Consolo , because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of stories about Charles  --  and about Charles and me . I 'm used to that by now , but these were a little nastier than most . And hep137could have stopped them but he did n't . So I do n't care what happens to him . I 'm just happy for Charles . " She gazed out into the big noisy crowded room and said , " If I lived to be a hundred and ten I do n't think I could ever be any prouder ! " She looked it ; I said , " You might even be a little proud of yourself , too . " " I am , " she said frankly . " I helped a lot , I think . I went on television and that was all right , and I met old biddies and young biddies and old pols and young pols and people who 'd known Charles since he was a baby and people who said they 'd known Charles since he was a baby and I shook hands and I danced the basic box step with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field days and cookouts and ball parks and rallies and reunions of Charles 's old Air Force buddies , and some of it was wonderful and some of it was just so plain unbelievably boring that you 'd want to shoot yourself that minute . But I did it , all of it , and I would n't not have done it for the world , and I know that in the end it helped . So in a way it 's my night , too . " Then she smiled and said , " And I 'll tell you what I did . Tonight : just before I came downstairs . I 'd finished dressing , and my maid had gone out , and I was all alone in the bedroom . And I stood in front of the mirror and just looked at myself for a long time . I thought I looked pretty . " She glanced down at herself now with satisfaction . " Pretty enough to be the Governor 's wife . And then do you know what I thought ? I thought , Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And it is n't , is it ? " " It 's not bad for anyone from West anywhere , " I said , and I meant it . But she meant it , too . She had been a poor girl , her parents had been born in Poland , and she herself had in a sense come from nowhere  --  certainly nowhere that my Uncle Jimmy had been willing to recognize . Charles had met her shortly after getting out of college , and what had happened then had been a genuinely romantic story . Because , where Phil had only the year before married Flossie , whom he had known all his life  --  a very fancyp138and glamorous wedding , with guests flown in from everywhere , and my Uncle Jimmy presiding loudly and proudly and lavishly  --  and I had just become engaged to Jean , whom I had known for most of mine , Charles , usually so much more watchful and prudent than either of us , fell in love with a complete stranger the very first time he met her . Love at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , it had happened . And I had been there when it had : at one of those huge charity balls held for the armed forces during the first year of the war . I had come home from the Navy and so had Phil  --  we had been able to arrange our leaves together  --  and Charles , as it happened , was to go into the Air Force the very next day : the ball was his last civilian fling . We had all gone together ; I had danced mostly with Jean , Phil mostly with Flossie , and Charles  --  Charles , after the first dance , very little with the girl he had brought : I even forget now who she was . He had danced with Marie  --  and by what route Marie Granowski had got there , or with whom she had come that night , I never knew . I did know that she left with Charles , and that he went into the Air Force the next morning . He came back as often as he could , sometimes for only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were engaged to be married . This roaring , swift romance was all **25;6885;TOOLONG of Charles , so uncharacteristic that it caught everyone by surprise , including my Uncle Jimmy . Apparently  --  althoughthis was hard to believe , considering that shrewd man  --  he had suspected nothing : it may have been that he was too preoccupied with his own activities , which during the war involved enormous amounts of travel and were said by some to be invaluable . He had of course met Marie , but then he had met many of Charles 's girls ; when , suddenly , he had discovered that this was something different , he had been furious . First there had been the matter of James , to which he had only recently become reconciled ; now there was Charles . He must have felt that his sons , one by one , were slipping away from his wishes , his plans , his control ; he had raged at Charles ( althoughp139as Charles told me , rather wryly , he could not threaten to cut him off entirely , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his twenty-first birthday ) ; he had actually put detectives on Marie . " And then when that did n't turn up anything juicy , " she had said to me , much later , " he sent them out to my home town , to get a line on my pop . I think he was hoping for a blackmailer , or at least a thief . Instead all he got was a sleepy Polish butcher , who liked to drink and did n't like to work . So then all he could fall back on was the old wrong-side-of-the-tracks , but of course that did n't count much with Charles . And I do n't think it really counted too much with jimmy , either . He 's pretty good on things like that . He 's pretty good on a lot of things . " " He 's just an old dear , " I had said . " No , he 's not that . But he is pretty good . The only thing was , he did n't want his boy to be trapped by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , he did n't make too much trouble . I think he might have liked me a little , even then . Anyway , he likes me now . So everything 's turned out fine . " And it had . Jimmy had given in . Charles had been respectful but firm ; unexpectedly he had received support from his mother , my Aunt Mary making one of her rare dissents from her husband . And Jimmy had capitulated , maybe out of sheer disgust ; Charles and Marie had been married : a small wedding , a service wedding , but jimmy had been there . And gradually he had come around . It may or may not have been true  --  as Marie had suggested  --  that Jimmy had liked her even then ; I always thought that the turning point came sometime after my Aunt Mary 's death , when my Uncle jimmy began to spend more time with Charles and Marie . In any case , it was certain that she was a great favorite now . Charles had married well ; Jimmy knew that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a sweetheart ! " he had said to me , about five years ago . " And I had her pegged all wrong at first : I thought she was some kind of Hunky hustler . Well , why not ? The woods are full ofp140them . And Charles was a good-looking guy with plenty of dough : a perfect setup for some bimbo sharpshooter . When I first set eyes on this one I said to myself , She 's got a great pair of legs : I 'll bet they can run like hell after a million bucks ! ' Well , I was all wet . She 's been the greatest thing in the world for him . When I think of some of the lemons he could have wound up with ! " For just a moment I had wondered if my Uncle Jimmy might not be turning obliquely to quite a different subject , one he had tried to discuss with me once or twice before  --  without much success , and with some unpleasantness . But then I had realized that he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : if he had decided to go after me again he would have done so head-on , not indirectly or by implication . So I had said nothing more , and neither had he . Marie said now , " But you have n't even seen Charles yet ! " " I 've tried , though . It 's not that easy : everybody else has the same idea . But I 'll make it . " " We were talking about you one night last week , " she said . " Somebody  --  I guess it must have been your publisher  --  sent us your new book . We got in the house late one night  --  I forget where we 'd been : campaigning somewhere  --  and there was your book , waiting for us . Charles picked it up and read it right through that night , all at once . He says it 's the best one yet . " " Good for Charles . What did you think of it ? " She laughed . " That 's a dirty trick , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Candidly she added , " And you know I wo n't . I always mean to , but I never do , do I ? And everybody says they 're wonderful . I always start them all right , but then I ca n't seem to pay attention to what 's going on , and the first thing you know I 'm lost . I think you have to have a special kind of mind to read mystery stories ; anyway , I 've never finished one . Not even yours , Jack . I feel terrible , but that 's the way it is . " Ten years ago , I had written a suspense story . I had done this mainly out of uncertainty . I had written two books before this ,  |p141both  of them straight novels . The first had been ignored by all critics and had not sold ; the second had been noticed by some , had won a mild respect  --  and had not sold . My situation had not been desperate , but neither had it been ideal . I was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was constant but not large , in order to live comfortably I needed to earn more . There had been no shortage of available jobs , thanks to my Uncle Jimmy 's influence , and he had several times urged me in one direction or another . But what I really wanted to do was write . I had no great dreams , I think I can honestly say I never overvaluedmyself as a writer , but what I did want to do was to write for myself , and to earn a living by that writing . I had discussed this with my publisher after the failure of my second book ; he had not been helpful . He had dealt with the crisis in his usual manner : he had taken me to lunch . Here he drank a great deal and talked about his own problems and , toward the end of the lunch , he talked with a kind of mournful hopefulness about the possibility of my next book 's achieving a " major breakthrough . " I did not believe this , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at this point that I had thought of writing a suspense story . Not a mystery , as Marie called it , not a thriller , not one of the newer genre in which the professional spy goes through his dirty business with disgust . I had thought of writing a book in quite another tradition  --  that of the ordinary unadventurous man accidentally caught up in the sinister world of international intrigue . The Riddle of the Sands , A Coffin for Dimitrios ; I had often read and thoroughly enjoyed books like these , and now I thought I might try to write one . I did . I wrote it very quickly ( for me ) : in less than four months No Change for Connemara was completed . It was a success . It was n't a best seller , but people bought it and read it , many more people than had ever bought anything I had written before . There was a fortunate sale to the moving pictures ; my publisher began to ask me to lunch more often . Ip142had found my niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so sure . But when , a year later , I wrote another , and it also did well , then I was ready to believe . It was not the kind of writing I had intended to do in the beginning , but it was a kind of writing which apparently I did well , and  --  more important  --  it was a kind of writing I did not in the least look down on . I think they were all good books of their kind : they were honest , decently plotted , with believable characters , and were reasonably well written . I was proud of writing them , in fact ; I knew that not everyone could have written them , and indeed that many writers who were better than I could not have written them , either . I was proud , then , of my particular competence . I wrote five more of these books , and by now I had a public : not vast , but steady . They were reliable buyers of my books , and these book sales , coupled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , although not handsome  --  it was miles short of Charles 's or Phil 's , for instance  --  still allowed me to live pleasantly and to travel as much as I wanted to . The latest of these books , The Zagreb Connection , was shortly to be published . It was this which Charles had read and Marie , of course , had not . " You 're making a big mistake on this one , " I said . " This one is great . It 's about a Polish butcher 's daughter who 's torn between going into politics and becoming a private eye . It 's based on real life . " " I 'd read something like that , " she said , " But you  --  " She was interrupted suddenly by a roll of drums ; we looked out of the alcove in the direction of the music and saw that the leader was standing in the foreground , motioning for silence . I had seen him often before : his name was Shep Nomad , and he was the current " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more splendid parties and receptions in the city . He was small and sleek and obsequious , and looked always as if he had recently been greased . " Lovely ladies and your gentlemen ! " he shouted , " May I havep143your kind attention ? May I ? Please ? If you will ? Thank you . On this momentuous occasion , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to pay my own humble musical tribute , not only to our fine new Governor , but also to his very beautiful and very lovely First Lady . May we now play for your pleasure a song of my own composition , written specially for this great and joyous occasion ? I call it It 's Always Marie ! ' " He turned with a great flourish of his baton ; immediately the orchestra began to play a melody which sounded very much like several others they had previously played . The chunky blonde girl stepped up to the microphone and once more began to sing : Who 's the most beautiful ? It 's always Marie ! Who 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks me Who 's fairest to see ? I tell them the truth It 's always Marie ... . The song went on for some time , through numberless mindless choruses ; when it was over there was tremendous applause . Shep Nomad took the chunky blonde singer by the hand ; they bowed together , acknowledging public tribute , and then they looked up and out over the crowd , possibly searching for Marie . She was standing by my side ; she had n't moved since the beginning of the song . I had n't looked at her , because I thought she must be dissolving in embarrassment . But now when I did I saw that I had been wrong , because she did n't seem embarrassed at all . The crowd had seen her by now and they were all looking toward us and applauding and shouting her name . She smiled and waved , and when she turned to me I saw that her eyes were truly shining . " Oh , jack ! " she said . " It 's so cheap . But is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for her to have been any happier than at that moment . She turned back to the crowd again and waved once more , and then , just before she went to meet them , she must have thought of something because she said to me , " Listen : I may not get another chance , but  --  have you heard from Jean ? I mean , lately ? " " No , " I said , a little stiffly , and a little untruthfully , too . BecauseI had heard from her , but this was n't anything I talked about easily , not even with Marie . " I wanted to tell you that I saw her a few months ago in Paris . We met on the street one day outside the Meurice . She was alone ; I do n't know where she was staying . She looked thin but very pretty and terribly chic . She came in for a minute and we had a cup of tea . She talked a lot about you . " " Yes , I know . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said impatiently . " Give her a break . What was so wrong about that ? She knew I 'd probably seen you and she just wanted to . . . I 'll talk to you later , " she said hastily , for the others had arrived and were thronging about her , and gradually she went through the crowd , away from me , shaking hands and smiling and accepting congratulations happily ; I saw Shep Nomad moving steadily toward her , a sheet of music in his hand : the presentation copy . For a few minutes after this I paid little attention to Charles 's party ; Marie 's mention of Jean had for some reason troubled me much more than I would have expected . But I did n't think about this for long , because the party simply rode in over all private thoughts : it was too big , there was too much noise . And so once again I began to move around , wedging my way through the moving , shouting , munching surge of tuxedos , looking for Charles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to seem like a tour of the past for me , because the longer I stayed , and the more I moved about , the more people I saw whom I had n't seen for a long time , but whom I once had seen very often , some of them every day . One of these , the first I ran into , was a man I hadp145been at school with when we were little boys . I had n't spoken to him or seen him for thirty years , he was immensely altered  --  bald and very fat and every feature coarsened  --  with nothing of the little boy visible today , and I had even forgotten his name , but instantly , the moment I saw him , I knew him , in the way that you somehow do recognize some people who stay forever memorable , not because of themselves , but because of their connection with some early , unprecedented , even calamitous event  --  and in the case of this man shaking hands with me now , I could rememberonly that as a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother time after time for the simple and appalling reason that he smelled bad . And now he was greeting me and introducing me to his wife and announcing to me  --  somewhat disquietingly , in view of my one overwhelming memory of him  --  that he was my greatest fan . " I read them all , " he said , " as soon as they come out . I read them all , and I like them all . They take my mind off myself at the end of a hard day 's work . And that 's saying something , because I work like a dog , day and night . Still , I ca n't complain . No man can that 's done as well as I have . " " Kinsella , " said his wife , looking at me . " Why , that 's the Governor'sname ! " " His brother , " my fan said . " The Governor 's his brother . " " His cousin , " I said . " Brother , cousin , what 's the difference ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to him at all , but did that stop me from giving him five grand for his campaign ? You bet your sweet life it did n't . And there 's plenty more where that came from . I may not write books , but I 've done all right . I never like to talk about myself , but since you asked I do n't mind telling you I 've got it made . A good business , my wife here , a lovely home in the country , three wonderful kids , and in the sixty-three per cent tax bracket  --  how 's that for a poor boy who had to make it on his own ? And I did , Jack . I 've cleaned up . But good ! " In more ways than one , apparently ; I wondered if now hep146sometimes remembered his old humiliations . I thought he probably did ; they were usually the hardest to forget . As I left him , still not able to recall his name , I saw Walshie coming toward me ; I shifted course and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against another part of the past , for now I walked directly into a small , jam-packed circle of old acquaintances who were here rejoicing in the victory . I had known them all since college ; fifteen years ago nothing could have brought them to a political gathering of any kind , but since that time there had been Adlai , there had been Jack , and now there was Charles . They had felt the touch , they had been spoken to , they had been awakened : for these correct candidates they had worked generously , hard , and sometimes with the arrogance of the freshly converted . In this they were assisted by their wives , who worked even more zealously , inspired by their belief that before the ADA and the League of Women Voters there had been Nothing . We met , we talked , some of the wives asked me about Jean , but then we went back to politics and the victory which was theirs and the new regime in which it was assumed that they would all play some as-yet-undefined role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call on them , they were very happy . And still I had n't done what I had come to do . I continued to walk and to stop and talk and to look around , but at no time did I so much as catch a glimpse of Charles ; then , all at once , someone from behind gripped me by the elbow and held on , and when I turned around , there he was . " Play your cards right , " he said to me , " and I can get you an introduction to the Governor . " I had n't seen him for months , apart from those television appearances ; he looked fine . There were a few faint touches of fatigue around the eyes , but except for this he showed no signs of having been through a long and very difficult campaign . He looked the same as always : no sudden gray , no added lines . He seemed as self-contained as ever , he would never have been asp147openly rejoicing as Marie , yet I could tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shook his hand and gave him my congratulations , I suddenly felt very happy for him and for Marie . And in a peculiar way I felt a satisfaction of my own , for this state , this city , was after all my home : I had had my childhood here , I had grown up here , I had spent most of my life here , and even though in recent years I had gone away often and sometimes stayed away a long time , I was a poor expatriate  --  I had never really felt at home anywhere else , and it had never occurred to me that this was not where I belonged . So I was bound here , it was a pleasant place to live , and yet it  --  and those of us who lived here  --  had been sold down the river time and time again . Politically it was a mess , and close to being a disaster . It had been this way for years , at least ever since I had begun to be interested in such matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoddy , penny ante quality it did not have in other states , that here everything was up for grabs and nothing was too small to steal . This probably was one of those facile overstatements much easier to make than to prove , but it 's true that underneath everything in our politics there seemed to be a depthless cushion of streetcornercronyism , a special kind of tainted , small-time fellowship which sent out a complex of vines and shoots so interconnected that even the sleaziest poolroom bookie managed in some way , however obscure , to be in touch with the mayor 's office or the governor 's chair . ( Three years ago , for instance , there had been an assistant attorney general who had conducted a series of investigationsinto fraud in the state . These investigations had been slow , expensive , and productive of nothing ; they had been on the point of being abandoned when suddenly , through some slipup , it was revealed that two and perhaps three of those being investigated had hidden but firm business links with the assistant attorney general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor had been in a quandary . It was a matter of some delicacy : not only was the assistant attorney general involved , but thep148mother had some time before been voted our state Mother of the Year . Reluctantly , and speaking feelingly of a mother 's misplaced zeal , the governor had at last fired the assistant attorney general , who had then been tried , found guilty , given a suspended sentence , and had then , in penitence , purchased a rather pleasant property in Jamaica . The Mother of the Year , herself mysteriously at liberty , had never forgiven the persecutors of her son . " The bastards were out to get him , " she said grimly , " and get him they did ! I hope to God they all fry like sausages in hell ! " ) This was an accepted condition of our political life . It was given periodic official rebuke and constant unofficial encouragement . And now , with Charles in charge  --  what ? Who knew ? He was unquestionablyhonest , he was competent , he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual obligations , so that he was certainly freer than most to make changes . And yet the question remained : could changes  --  anything other than token changes , that is  --  really be made ? Given , for example , our legislature ? Or given , for another example , our state ? Or even , come to think of it , given Charles ? Because as I stood here looking at him , congratulating him , and taking pleasure in his victory , I suddenly realized how little I knew him . The Charles I really knew was a fat little boy who fell off horses , who was a pest with his questions , who played catch with me on an Irish lawn , who was my junior by a year and who had always been that year behind me in school . And I suppose I still thought of him in that faintly patronizing way you do think of slightly smaller boys who are a year or a step behind , who always seem to be tagging along , when the truth was that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful man , who must have changed no less than all of us change , who had had three children and all kinds of other experiences which I had not , and who , because he had a life of his own which was increasinglyremoved from mine , now had ideas and abilities and strengths or defects which I could n't even begin to assess . So that it was probably presumptuous and even meaningless for me to bep149standing here , calculating his chances of success , especially when all the room was filled with an excitement , a positive hope that something new and good was about to happen . And despite my own pessimism I could n't help , just at this moment , feeling at least some of that excitement myself , but all I said to him was , " I 'll give you a compliment : you 're a great improvement on your predecessor . " " Thanks a lot , " he said dryly . " Do n't say any more : effusiveness embarrasses me . How 've you been ? " " Not bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at each other ; I said curiously , " Charles , what does it feel like ? Being elected Governor ? " " Oh , " he said , " a little like being elected mayor . Only more so . You have n't met these two , have you ? " I had n't . They were two men who had come up with him and were now standing slightly to his rear . They were slender , neat , unremarkable-looking  --  I could have seen either one of them a hundred times any day in this city  --  and young : I guess they were perhaps seven or eight years younger than Charles . And oddly , while they were not at all alike in their appearance , there was something about each one that suggested the other : a shared attitude , I think , more than anything else , an air which was pleasant but extremely alert ; it was as if they were both enjoying themselves quietly but keeping their eyes peeled , too . When Charles introduced us I recognized the names as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the campaign : they were two of the inner circle of professional young politicians who had rallied to Charles from the beginning , who had served him while he was mayor , and who were now said to be closer to him than anyone with the exception of his brothers and my Uncle Jimmy . " They know all about you , " Charles said . " Jerry 's read all your books , including the two early ones . Ray does n't read much of anything but the voting lists , but then of course he went to Loyola , where the curriculum prepares you for that sort of thing . "  |p150The  two men smiled ; the smaller one  --  Ray  --  said to me , " We have one connection , though . I think you know my dad : Bill Keegan . He used to be a cop at City Hall ; he was always assigned to Frank Skeffington . " I had known his father well : a slim , solemn-faced man fanatically tidy , impeccably honest  --  in short , a great curiosity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I told his son this now . He nodded . " It worked both ways . Dad always liked him a lot ; he 'd never hear a word against him . " He smiled again and said , " Apparently the old man used to give him these Babe Ruth autographedbaseballs to pass around to the kids . As souvenirs of the city . I always wondered who really did that autographing . Skeffingtonhimself ? " It was a simple question which took me in an instant back across twenty years to a hot , dusty afternoon in summer  --  early summer , before everyone had left on vacation . The overhead fan was circling slowly in the mayor 's office , the blinds were partly closed so that the light came in broken by thin slats of shadow , while the courtly old figure  --  looking , at this time of the year , like a Southern plantation owner in his ice cream suit  --  rose from behind the vast mahogany desk , slowly fingering a baseball which he had selected from the big box on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said thoughtfully . " It has everything . A golden opportunity to throw deadly objects at the heads of all your friends and still claim it 's all being done in the spirit of fun . I 've always thought that a game like that had to be invented by the Irish . Come on , let 's get these things signed . All these admiring youngsters have parents who vote . " I said now , " Sometimes , when he felt like it . But mostly I did . " The three men looked at each other ; Charles said , " The good old days . You see how simple it was ? " " I 'll tell my dad I saw you , " Ray said . " He 's retired now . " " Like Jack , " Charles said . " Jack retired from politics years ago because of old age . He was twenty-five . He went out with Skeffing/ton . The difference was that he went out voluntarily . " He looked at me with amusement in his eyes . " Any time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And quite suddenly , as he was talking , I realized how odd all this was : standing here in Charles 's house , talking to Charles about Frank Skeffington , with Charles himself now incredibly in the same position of powerful control that Skeffington once had held  --  and talking , moreover , as if we were having a private conversation , when I did n't have to look around or even lift my head to be reminded that it was very far from being private . All the while we had been talking we had been ringed by an audience which had kept the minimum respectful distance , and which seemed to be held back by invisible leashes . They were eager , not missing a word ; obviously they were just waiting their chance to swoop in on Charles . Jerry , who had said very little up to now , suddenly stepped forward and said something quietly to Charles , so quietly that I could n't hear it . Charles frowned slightly , then looked at his watch and said , " All right . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he said , " Jack , will you be around awhile ? I have to see someone . " " I think I might go along . It 's a busy night , Charles ; I just wanted to come in to say hello . " " No , stay , " he urged . " We 're all getting together up in the library . Pa 's here , Aunt Gert : everybody . They 'll want to see you , and I want to talk to you . Go on up to the library in about fifteen minutes ; they 'll all be there by then . Meanwhile , " he said , glancing around , then coming back to me with the same amused look in his eyes , " I have a treat for you . Just to help you pass the time . And to remind you of those good old days . " He beckoned to the crowd and said , " Ben , come on over here a moment . " Immediately a thin long-faced man in his late middle age shot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others in the room , he was not wearing formal clothes . He had on a military uniform , and in his hand he held an overseas cap . Hep152said , in a voice which was like a salute , " Governor , at your serv-ice ! " " This is Commander Ben Bannigan , who 's in charge of one the posts of the Veterans of Foreign Wars , " Charles said , looking at me now with a complete absence of any kind of expression . " The Commander came to us several times during the campaign with a problem that 's been bothering him , and I 'm afraid we may have let him down . Knowing your deep interest in the veterans , Jack "  --  and here , privately , for me , there was just the flick of expression  --  " Ithought you were probably just the man to help him out . Ben , " he said , switching to the Commander , " this is my cousin , Jack Kinsella . He writes books , but more to the point , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours , Frank Skeffington . So I know that your particular kind of problem is right up his street . Now , if I were you , I 'd tell him all about it . " It was a dirty trick ; I knew that even before I saw Charles 's two aides exchange glances , I knew it as soon as I saw the Commander . He was a familiar type ; he was on me even before Charles , with a little nod and just the faintest of smiles , left . " Thank God you were a personal friend of Frank 's ! " the Commander said ; he had me by the coat , grabbing me with a thick-veined little hand . " There 's the man that could of settled all this with both hands tied behind his back . I do n't say a word against your cousin the Governor , we 're right behind him all the way , but there 's a lot of young wise guys around him that tries to keep the veterans away from him . Wise little sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell do they care about men that left their families and got gassed and died and . . . " This went on for some time ; after a few minutes he turned to a more particular grievance . A rival organization had been poachingon his preserve : on the previous Memorial Day , Legionnaires all over the state had been observed selling poppies . And not just selling poppies , but announcing them to be the genuine Buddy Poppies . The Commander was in a rage.  | " What the hell right has the Legion got to sell Buddy Poppies ? Buddy Poppies belong to the Veterans of Foreign Wars ! We always had that name ! There 's only one veterans ' organization in the country that 's always had the right to sell Buddy Poppies on Memorial Day and that 's the VFW ! And this year what happens but all of a sudden those Legion bastards start showing up on street corners all along the whole parade , telling people that do n't know any better that they were selling Buddy Poppies ! All a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nobody ! You might just as well live in Russia when men that gave up their jobs and their arms and their legs to fight for their country ca n't even come back and sell their own Buddy Poppies without somebody else that 's got no right muscling in and ... " Charles had disappeared from the room . The Commander was his legacy to me , his little joke , and I could n't decide whether he was paying me back for having said merely that he was an improvementover his awful predecessor  --  which was a fairly pale compliment  --  or whether he was showing me some of the slight contempt he undoubtedly felt for the older kind of politics and the simpler kind of problem which had been so conspicuous a feature of them  --  and showing me , moreover , by using ( or slightly burlesquing ? ) a favored technique of Skeffington himself . In any case , I was saddled with the Commander , a survival from another day , and as he churned unhappily along , I heard him without really listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had time to kill before I went up to the library , there was no one down here I especially wanted to see , and since more people seemed to have come in it would have been harder than ever to move around . So I stayed where I was , and while the Commander continued his aggrieved chatter , I found myself thinking once more of Skeffington , not only because this was his kind of trick , but because it was he who had taught me how to listen to all such sustained complaints . " The thing to remember is that all pests are talkers , " he hadp154said to me one day . " The women are the worst , but the men are bad enough . There 's no such thing as a pest who listens . A pest talks , and he talks all the time . Now , if one gets hold of you , there are a couple of ways of handling him . The first way is simply to stare at him while he talks to you . Just stare : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't make a sound : just keep looking right into his eyes . Sooner or later , this will get to him . Silence unnerves pests . They do n't really want you to say anything , but they expect you to nod and make certain ritual sounds  --  ' uh-huh ' is highly acceptable  --  whenever they pause for breath . That proves you 're there and listening . If you do n't do that it throws them off ; they start to stumble , pretty soon they stop talking , and then they go away . The only trouble is that they 're apt to go away mad , and if you 're in my profession it 's necessary to remember that pests vote too . So I 've settled for another way : matter of fact , I 've becomerather good at it . It requires the appearance of sympathetic understanding . It 's not necessary to listen to anything they say  --  you can keep right on going with your private thoughts  --  but every once in awhile you have to cluck or shake your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay any attention to what you say ; it 's the sound that counts . Once you get good enough at it you can say anything : you can spout jabberwocky at them and they wo n't bat an eye . The secret is in using the proper tone . And then , when they 're all done , you simply look at them , take them by the hand , and say , I thank you . You 've done us all a great service . ' Or words to that effect ; I do n't want to seem too rigid . You 'll have to develop your own style . We 've got a prize specimen coming in here in a few minutes ; I may be able to give you a slight demonstration . " And when the man had come in he had come in talking ; even while Skeffington was shaking his hand he was into his subject . A seedy little fanatic , he had come to talk about playgrounds . The city playgrounds were in poor shape ; there were swings and dandles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cousin of his , an honorp155student at a well-known college for gymnasts , had been unable to secure summertime employment at any of these playgrounds ; what was going to be done about the men 's toilets ? Skeffington had listened with courtesy , occasionally inclining his large head in grave agreement ; whenever his visitor came up for air Skeffington murmured , indistinguishably and soothingly . This went on for a few minutes and then suddenly , during one of the pauses , Skeffington , using the same soothing tone , said very distinctly , " Abracadabra , dum dum dum ! " Startled , I had looked at his visitor , expecting indignation or at least bafflement . Instead the man had nodded vigorously and said , " Right ! And another thing . . . " And he had gone on talking . Skeffington had not even glanced at me during this , but later , when the man had left , after first being thanked for being of service to the city , the old man had said to me , " I 'm getting old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted you to see that with people like that you never have to listen to a word because they never listen to you . And if you want to say anything it 's perfectly all right , as long as you say it in the right way . The manner is everything . Now go on home and practice on a relative . Or the parish priest . First thing you know you 'll be a virtuoso and you 'll save yourself all kinds of trouble in later life . " I had not practiced , I had not become a virtuoso , but simply by being around Skeffington I had at least learned to listen the right way , and this is what I did now with the Commander . Finally he finished ; at least there were no more sounds ; I said that terrible things were on the increase and this was certainly one of them . We shook hands and the Commander left me , presumably to find another listener . Alone , I looked around , the room was as active and noisy as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now himself singing hoarsely a song of someone else 's composition , and I looked at my watch and then I started for the front hall and the stairs which led to the library and the family  --  the more private division of Charles 's great victory party.  |p156THE  library doors were closed ; it was Phil who opened them . " Aha ! " he said . " Writer , traveler , total stranger . Come in anyway . We 're talking about politics . How 's that for a surprise ? " I had n't seen him since I had come home . Like Charles , he seemed completely unchanged , and for just that moment of meetingI got , once again , that sudden flash of confusion , the sense of jumbled identities . He said shrewdly and at once , " And the funny thing is I knew you right away . " I said , " Cut it out . Did either one of you ever think of wearing a moustache ? Or a badge ? " " Speak to the candidate , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . He 's not here at the moment , but everybody else is , as you can see . We 're all running away from that Elks picnic downstairs . How about that turkey-trot music , by the way ? Is n't that the greatest ? Were you moved ? " " Deeply . Every note an experience . " " I thought so , " he said . " Especially that song to Marie . I tell you , Jack , the people who go around saying lovely melodies died with Jerry Kern just do n't know Shep Nomad . " " Never mind that , " Marie said , coming over to us . " Nobody 's ever written a song to you , and nobody ever will . "  | " Positively not Shep Nomad , " he said . " Or at least I hope not . Because for one thing he 's queen bee in the local fag set . Just in case you 've led a sheltered life . " " Who , the band leader ? " my Uncle Jimmy said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Aunt Gert and Phil 's wife , Flossie ; they had all waved as I came in , and my Uncle Jimmy had left them and followed Marie over to us . Now sixtysevenor sixty-eight , he seemed to me the one who had changed least of all , because he looked exactly as I remembered him in Ireland thirty years ago and at all the stages in between . It was n't that he had preserved his youth ; it was simply that , to me , he had always looked just about the way he did now : never young , never old , but persistently ageless . He said to me , " Hello , Jack , how 's the boy ? " He made a fist and delivered a short mock-punch to my side . " What about that bandleader ? " he said . " He 's a nance , right ? " " The nanciest , " Phil said . " I thought so , " my Uncle Jimmy said . " I can spot a nance a mile away . When I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I said to myself , Oh oh : another one . ' I 'd get rid of him . Fast . I would n't have him around the house for five minutes . " " We thought it was safe enough , " Marie said . " What can he do : seduce an alderman on the bandstand ? " From the beginning she had never been particularly deferential to my Uncle Jimmy . She had always spoken up to him , and althoughthis had seldom been welcomed at first , in the end it had won her a position of privilege . It was a position not shared by everyone  --  Flossie , for example , although originally considered to be a far greater catch , had never quite managed to make the grade . " Listen , " my Uncle Jimmy said , taking me by the arm , " how about giving this subject the old heave-ho ? Hah ? Charles is Governor , here 's Jack back again , and we stand around shooting the breeze about some fat-assed nance . Now if you and Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just so long as the kids are out of the way and asleep . For all I care he can shuck off his clothes and chase a monsignor around the piano . " " That ought to help out , " I said , " with Charles as Governor . I imagine a thing like that could get into the papers . " My Uncle Jimmy gave me a derisive look . " What 'll you bet ? " he said . " For instance , what paper ? Do n't make me laugh . I hear you 've got a new book . " " Brand-new , " I said . " It comes out practically tomorrow . " My Uncle Jimmy nodded . He was greatly interested in my books . Not that he enjoyed reading them  --  I do n't think he ever read one ; in fact I never saw him read any fiction , let alone mine : he had little time for such frivolity  --  but his conception of family loyalty included more than support to his sons . Indirectly I learned that he bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote as soon as it was published ; he distributed these books to friends and acquaintances everywhere . When , once , I had thanked him for this , and told him that it was far beyond ordinary kindness and , moreover , that it was not really necessary , he had denied the whole thing . " I might buy a copy or so at an airport , " he said , " to give to some lunkhead beside me on a plane . I figure it might keep him from getting airsick and heaving all over me . But that 's all . " But I think he was really rather proud of having a writer in the family  --  even a writer of mysteries  --  and quite often I ran into people who told me that my Uncle Jimmy had been boasting about me . Quite often , too , I got little appreciative notes from people  --  sometimes people of surprising eminence  --  who had been on the receiving end of my Uncle Jimmy 's largess . So that now when he nodded I knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've seen it around the house , " he said . " Charles has got it . He read it and liked it . Have you seen him yet ? "  |p159I  said I had , and he said , " There 's a sweetheart for you : he 'll show them all how to do it before he 's through . He ran a campaign that would knock your hat off . " I said , " I hear you helped . " " You 're damn right I did , " he said . " I hear you did n't . " I often wondered how long my immunity from my Uncle Jimmy 's displeasure would continue . Like Charles , like Marie , like the rest of the family , he had always seemed to accept the fact that I just did n't get involved in Charles 's campaigns , and this was curious , for although I think he understood the reason , I do n't think he had any great sympathy with it , and he had always expressed himself frequently and loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was my guess that he privately thought that any contribution I might make would be negligible . I was n't sure of this , though : he was a prickly man , and whenever he spoke sharply  --  as he had just now  --  I suspected that an explosion might be near . But I had always found directness the best tactic with him , and so I said , " That 's right , I did n't . So I guess we both heard right . " Phil said easily , " Pa , are you getting set to wallop Jack ? " But it was all a false alarm ; my Uncle Jimmy just laughed . " Listen , " he said , in great good humor , " I feel too good tonight to wallop anybody . And ca n't you see an old poop like me trying to wallop this kiddo ; he 's got a build like a fullback ! " It was a pleasant , if absurd , exaggeration : it was my Uncle Jimmy 's high spirits . He swung another mock-punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to wallop him ? Hah ? Whose beeswax is it if a sharp young guy with a lot on the ball wants to stay home horsing around with fairy stories when he could be out in the action and helping to run the show ? All because he got mixed up with that old chromo twenty years ago and after that he got sour on the whole deal ! Right ? " " You know that 's the second time tonight somebody broughtp160Skeffington up , " I said . " The first time it was Charles , about a half an hour ago . It 's interesting the way he seems to stick in your mind . " " Do n't try to give me the needle ! " my Uncle Jimmy said , not quite so jovially . " He does n't stick in my mind ! I dropped that clown in the dead letter slot thirty years ago ! All these mushmouthedMicks around here thought he was God with that fake voice and the big hello ! But I had him pegged from the start : a small-timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : every time he left town to monkey with the big boys they had to loan him his carfare to get home ! " Even so long after Skeffington 's death , my Uncle Jimmy spoke with a kind of growing fury ; I never knew just what the quarrel between the two men had been . I had asked my Uncle jimmy but he had refused to be pinned down to any definition ; Skeffingtonhad contented himself with ironic reference , calling him Mister Pazoosas , The Father of the Family , or The Kindly One . My father once told me that in his opinion there had never been any single quarrel , but that Skeffington had enjoyed baiting my Uncle Jimmy and had done so almost continually . " He could n't resist , " my father said . " A man like your Uncle Jimmy , who was so full of the miracle of his own achievement , and who really had very little humor to go along with it , was a natural for Skeffington . The old man just kept on rolling off these elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jimmy kept on frothing at the mouth . It was foolish of both of them , of course . It was foolish of Skeffington because more than once Jimmy could have been of great help to him  --  and as it was , more than once he nearly ruined him . And it was downright silly of Jimmy , because by then he was operating nationally , he was n't interested in purely local politics , and what Skeffington said should n't have bothered him at all . But it did . Oh my , how it did ! " And , apparently , still did . But it was a subject we left now , be/cause my Aunt Gert and Flossie joined us  --  my Aunt Gert looking older now , her hair gray , but still laughing , still very fat , still going on her pilgrimages with her girl friends , and still keeping a very sharp eye on the things that mattered : AT &T,; IBM , Standard Oil of New Jersey . She had never remarried ; she was very rich . She greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek , and I said to her , " Aunt Gert , I 've missed you more than I can say . I have n't had a word of sensible advice since I last saw you . Let 's get together some day soon for lunch . I have a few questions I 'd like to ask you about growth stocks . " " Growth stocks ! " she said delightedly . " Listen to the boy , Jimmy : growth stocks ! You might just as well ask me about Zulu cannibals or what it 's like up there on the moon . Growth stocks : Mother of God , what would I know about a thing like that ? " And she gave her great laugh . It was a game she still loved to play : a bewildered woman , helpless in a male world run by skillful rascals . Phil said to me , " Aunt Gert 's just back from Lourdes . How is it over there this year , Aunt Gert ? They 're still in the same line of work , are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , they 're like most of the rest of us , are n't they ? I do n't think we change much either . Of course , " she said pleasantly , " some of us grow up a little . " " Pow ! " Marie said . " Did anyone feel that , I wonder ? " " Hey , Aunt Gert , " Phil said admiringly , " who taught you how to throw that right ? " Aunt Gert beamed at him . " God love you , dear , " she said . " What right ? Are n't we having just a little family chat ? " " Jack , " Flossie said , in her clear and rather formal voice , " how long will you be back this time ? " She was changing the - subject and none too artfully , but she was never quite at her ease in the presence of this family badinage , even though by this time she had been exposed to it for a good many years . She was tall , as tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful in a strange way : her eyes were a deep , extraordinary violet , really remarkable ,  |p162and  were long and faintly oblique . This gave her something of an exotic appearance which was entirely misleading , for Flossie was a great conservative : she was a good wife and an excellent mother , she did all the correct things instinctively and well . And yet in this family she remained a little bit of an outsider . She came from old , honored Yankee stock  --  she was the only non-Catholic in my Uncle Jimmy 's family circle  --  and even her accent set her apart ; jean used to call her Little Girl Lost . This was too strong  --  in the family she was not a lonely or forlorn presence  --  but it 's true that she failed to fit in as completely as the rest . The key to this was of course my Uncle Jimmy . He was neither cruel nor rude to her , but he was apt to pass her by , to pay her less attention than he paid others , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little courtesies and well-intentioned behavior , to work herself into his particular good graces , she sometimes tried too hard . " She presses , " Phil had once said to me . It was the only time he had ever spoken to me about his wife and his father , but I knew that it bothered him . " She presses all the time with him , and you ca n't press too hard with a bulldozer like Pa : it just makes him worse . I 've told her that , and she knows it , but she goes on pressing . She ca n't help it : she wants to be liked . Well , okay , I 'm all for that , because he should like her : she 's a great girl . But she does n't understand Pa , and he sure enough does n't understand her . He thinks she 's la-di-da ; as soon as she opens her mouth to offer him a hot dog he starts thinking of Episcopal bishops ! " I liked Flossie and felt a little sorry for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-tanned girl in a white tennis dress  --  she was a very good tennis player and had won local championships  --  walking with a brisk , long-legged stride off the court , to be joined by her four little children , who obediently and affectionately followed Mommy to the pool . I talked with her now for a moment , and then my Uncle Jimmy came back . He had gone off to fix himself a drink ; now he came back saying loudly , " Listen  --  "  |p163But  exactly what we were to listen to was not said , for just then James came into the room . He greeted me and explained that he had been off in one of the bedrooms , changing ; he was leaving in a few minutes to catch a plane to Miami and then to South America ; on the very next evening he would address some sort of ecumenical conference in Peru . " Why Peru , for God 's sake ? " Phil said . " Why not Peru ? " James said . With a swift automatic deftness he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black attache case and snapping the case shut . " The trouble is you ca n't hold all your meetings in Atlantic City if you claim to be a Universal Church . People eventually get suspicious . Besides , I like Peru . There 's nothing I look forward to more than preaching in Cuzco . I 'll be doing that next Sunday . " " It 's your sense of continuity , " I said . " The Incas , the Temple of the Sun , and now you . " " It 's a matter of height , not history , " he said . " You see , in Cuzco you 're eleven thousand feet up . The plaza is packed with people , you begin preaching , and pretty soon they start dropping like flies , one by one . You never can be sure whether it 's the altitude or the impact of your message . But it 's very gratifying : I never come away from Cuzco without feeling slightly awed by my own powers . " Marie said , " James is right out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-traveled cleric , anyway , " Phil said . " This week Cuzco , next week Nome , then on to Barcelona . Have soutane , will travel . Has anyone ever done a paper on Pan-Am and the Pastor ? James , whatever happened to all those good old country priests I used to read about ? " " They 're right where they always were , " James said . " In the country . " He looked at me and smiled and said , " Actually . " He was not yet forty-five , but his hair was pure white ; as slim and as elegant as ever , he was a handsome man : the best-lookingp164of the three brothers . Twenty-five years ago he had surprised everyone by entering the seminary . Most of all , I remember , he had surprised my Uncle Jimmy , who had been furious : he had not raised his oldest boy to become a humble diocesan priest . He had been mollified , however , when James had not become one . Instead he had become famous . Or moderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , but owing to the imprecision which occasionally marks newspaper coverage of the clergy , he was not infrequently described as " the brilliant Jesuit preacher . " This James had come to accept with an exasperated tolerance . " The papers are wonderful , " he had said . " And the magazines . You see , they have a simple gauge : any priest who can say nuclear ' instead of nucular ' is by definition a Jesuit . And any Jesuit is of course a brilliant Jesuit . Therefore ... " He was surely bright , probably brilliant ; he was a remarkably good preacher ; he was not a Jesuit . He was in fact a parish priest who had risen far above the limits of his parish . In this rise he was undoubtedly helped by my Uncle Jimmy , whose network of wellplacedconnections could hardly have been a handicap , but the greatest help of all had come from another quarter in the form of the winds inspired by Pope John and the aggiornamento . Extremely able , temperamentally suited to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of Church Unity he traveled everywhere , an immaculate , persuasive apostle of peace , healing old wounds , addressing traditional enemies . His work was now almost entirely with what were called the Separated Brethren ; so much so that Phil once said to me , " I saw James doing a funny thing this morning : he was talking to a Catholic ! " And now he was leaving the family , and the new Governor , on his way to Peru ; my Uncle Jimmy said , " Watch out for those babies down there , boy . A handful of crooked Spies sticking the shiv into a mob of midget Indians : that 's Peru . I know ; I had ap165little business down there a couple of years ago . Everybody was on the take . " James said , " I 've got protection : my host is Archbishop Segura . " " Forget it , " my Uncle Jimmy said . " I know him , too . He 's got a hand like a first baseman 's mitt and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Y. " James nodded , seemed amused , but said no more . He got ready to leave , then drew my Uncle Jimmy to one side and they held a short private conversation while the rest of us talked together . In a few minutes they rejoined us ; James said goodbye to us all , gave us his blessing , and then left to go looking for Charles . But this proved to be unnecessary , for just as he opened the door Charles came in . The two brothers stood there for perhaps thirty seconds , talking ; James laughed at something Charles said . Then he turned and waved to us and was off on his way to Peru and still another conference . Charles greeted us , kissed Marie , then dropped into a chair . " Does anybody here want to be Governor ? " he said . " I 've just finished a fifteen-minute talk with Dan Cogan . " I had known Cogan years ago , when he had been a young , primitive , and extremely ambitious politician . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm and rather brutal hand . My Uncle Jimmy said , " What did that bum want ? " " He said he did n't want anything , " Charles said . " Except to wish me well . " " For fifteen minutes ? " Phil said . " There did seem to be one thing more , " Charles said . " He said he was eager to cooperate in every way . Jack , back in the golden days , what did it mean when a man like Dan Cogan , in Dan Cogan 's position , said that he was eager to cooperate in every way ? " I said , " It meant that he wanted a piece of the action . Usually a rather big piece . And of all the action . " He nodded . " It 's nice to know that the old customs still hangp166on . Because that 's what Cogan wanted , of course . He reminded me of the help he 'd given me during the past year . Then he talked a bit about legislatures and governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very specific : just good , general , reasonably offensive talk . " " He 's bad news , " my Uncle Jimmy said . " You 're going to have trouble with that baby . " " I think we 're all agreed on that , " Charles said . " He 's horrible , " Marie said , with a little shiver . " I mean , really horrible : of all the people in the campaign he 's the only one I could n't stand even being near . He 's always touching you : even when he shakes hands he ca n't help hanging on for that extra second . " " He touches everyone , " Charles said . " Except perhaps his wife ; I do n't think he cares much about shaking hands with her . He 's had a succession of young secretaries ; one of them was a pretty little Puerto Rican girl named Rodriguez . She 's back in Puerto Rico now with nothing to remind her of Dan but a small income . And a five-year-old son who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with that ? " my Uncle Jimmy asked . " No , " Charles said . " That 's always a chancy business . And in this case you just ca n't prove it . He 's not a stupid man , you know . He 's very clever . At least I think he is . " He turned to my Aunt Gert and said , " How about you , Aunt Gert ? You know about these things . Do n't you think a man is clever who has a house in the country worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars , an apartment in town which rents for thirteen and a half thousand a year , and tools around in a Cadillac Fleetwood  --  all on a declared income of twenty-two thousand seven hundred and fifty ? " " God love you , dear , " my Aunt Gert said , " I only hope a clever man like that does n't have any enemies . Because if he did I imagine one of them might put in a call to Charlie Halloran downp167at the Internal Revenue office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail . " " I think those enemies have already called Charlie , " Charles said . " He and some of his friends from Washington have had several talks with Cogan . It does n't seem to have amounted to much . " " What about net worth ? " my Uncle jimmy said . " No soap ? " Charles shook his head . " No soap . He knows what he 's doing ; it 's all covered up . Not a trace so far . By the way , how well do you know George Baxter ? " " Baxter Construction ? I know him , " my Uncle Jimmy said . " We used to play golf together once in a while at Shady Lawn . " He said to me , " There was a hell of a golf course , Jack . Every green like a pool table . Your father used to play out there a lot ; there was a dwarf caddie he liked . You ever been out there ? " I said I had , and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't know the place . All changed ; it 's not even a golf course any more . Some foundation 's grabbed it and turned it into a joint where a mob of spongers live for free and tell each other how swell they are . Mostly writers and actors : your kind of racket . You know what I mean ? " " I know what you mean , Uncle Jimmy . " " I walked around for about half an hour , " he said . " As far as I could see everybody out there was either a dope fiend or a dinge . Some foundation ! " " Fine , " Charles said . " That 's the kind of talk I like to hear . Let 's get back to George Baxter : do you suppose you can get him in here to see me one day next week ? " " Why not ? " my Uncle Jimmy said . " What for ? " " His company just got the contract on the new veterans ' hospital , " Charles said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd talk to Baxter about a few of the details : there might just be something there . I doubt it , but you never know . "  | " You wo n't find out anything from Baxter , " my Uncle Jimmy said , " because he 's not running the show . The company 's been reorganized ; the real muscle there is the new treasurer : a sharp little Canuck called Allaire . From Quebec . Baxter 's got nothing upstairs . He 's a featherhead and he always was . " Charles said dryly , " That 's all right with me . For this kind of talk I do n't want Allaire ; I want the featherhead . Maybe we 'll get lucky . And maybe we wo n't . Maybe we 'll just have to play along with the legislative leader a while longer . " He looked across at Phil and said , " You have n't said much . No new thoughts ? " " No , " Phil said , " but that 's only because I 'm pretty crazy about the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind-the-scenes glimpse of a crack in the solid Kinsella wall . Phil and I differ on the right way to handle people like Cogan . " Phil shrugged . " You 're the Governor ; you can handle it your way if you want to . That 's obvious . And I 'm not saying it wo n't work because I think it will . I am saying that in the long run it 's dangerous , and dangerous to you . And you know what I mean because we 've  --  " And then Phil stopped in mid-sentence . He was now looking forward , talking directly to Charles as though the rest of us were n't here , and although he had started by talking casually , almost indifferently , he had suddenly begun to speak with intensity , even passion  --  which was startling , because no one in the room was prepared for it . Phil had probably realized this , because as he stopped so abruptly he glanced quickly around at all of us , and then he smiled and went back to Charles . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them were talking together , " Just for a change , how would it be if I laid off crabbing tonight ? And told you that I 'm satisfied , that I 'm glad , that I 'm proud . And hopeful . Very hopeful . Because all that 's true , you know . Believe it or not . "  |p169Charles  looked back at him and smiled and said in the same personal , almost excluding way , " I think I 'd like that . " My Uncle Jimmy broke in on this private conversation , sounding both annoyed and slightly baffled . " Hey hey hey ! " he said . " What goes on here , anyway ? You two going in business for yourself ? Hah ? What is all this bushwa ? " And for just a moment , in listening to Phil and Charles talk , I had shared my Uncle Jimmy 's bafflement , because it seemed to me that I had caught a note I had not caught before  --  a somehow disturbingnote  --  and when I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely apprehensive . My Uncle Jimmy stood facing them , his feet wide apart and his pose one of challenge . He was frowning , he was not fond of mysteries , and now , suddenly , and for the first time since I had known him , I found myself wondering whether my Uncle Jimmy was still on top of the family situation , or whether something might not now be going on which was beyond both his knowledge and control . But this was a quick thought , a flash , an impression gained from no more than a look and two or three sentences , and it could have been all wrong . Certainly from what Phil now said it seemed to be , for he turned to his father with a quick gaiety and said , " Pa , you 're right : it 's bushwa all the way . Pure , homogenized , grade-A bushwa . The fact is that I 've been nagging the Governor on a few minor points and now I 've stopped . Anyway , for tonight . So what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little family toast ? To Charles , and to the greatest break this state has had for the last hundred years ! " " You 're damn right I do ! " my Uncle Jimmy said . " Only cut out that hundred years baloney . What happened a hundred years ago that was so hot ? Hah ? Why stop there ? No , we 'll all drink to Charles , and never mind any phony time limits . And I 'll tell you something else : we 're going to have three toasts , not just one . The first one is for Charles . My boy Charles , " he said , lookingp170fondly , almost burstingly , at his youngest son . " And then , when we 've finished with that , we 're all going to drink a toast to your Ma . Nobody ever lived for all of her family the way she did , and nobody , not even me , would have been happier here tonight . And last of all is another toast . This one I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join me . Because this one , " he said , and his voice , which had trembled ever so slightly when he spoke of my Aunt Mary , now seemed for just an instant to become even more uncertain , " this one is for all my boys . For James , for Phil , for Charles . I wish James could be here right now , but he knows what I 'm going to say because I told him just what I 'm going to tell you . And that is that I 'm a lucky man . The papers and the magazines have been saying that about me for forty years : Lucky Jimmy Kinsella . But they had it all wrong , because they never once put down where I was really lucky : with my family , all growing up and sticking together the way I always hoped it would , each one making it better for all the rest of us . I hear people telling me all the time how big a credit James and Phil and Charles are to me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never gave a damn what anybody else thought . Because I know what I know , and that is that nothing I ever did in all my life , except marry your Ma , gave me the right to have boys like you ! " It was an extraordinary speech  --  extraordinary because it was so completely unlike him . There had been no salty style , no picturesquetouches : it had been straight and simple and towards the end it had shaken with emotion . I think it was this emotion which really took me by surprise , for I had never thought of my Uncle Jimmy as being an emotional man at all . Not only was he extremely hard-boiled  --  and his reputation for this was not merely familial or local : I can remember my sense of shock when , years ago , in a college lecture hall , I had suddenly realized that the man under discussion as the archetype of the newer , harder economic adventurer was in fact my uncle  --  but he did not have the weak/ness common to so many hard-boiled men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not weep cheap tears at sentimental movies ; he did not weep at all . So that when he spoke as he had just now it took me completely off guard . I knew of course of his enormous pride in his sons , but this had come from more than pride  --  this had come from love . It had been a cry from the heart  --  the rarely observed precinct within my Uncle Jimmy  --  and I found it unexpectedly moving . Obviously , the others did too . The two boys were looking only at their father now , and their faces were not composed ; I saw Marie look at Charles and then just touch the corner of her eye ; my Aunt Gert made no bones about it : she was crying freely . It was a rare moment , a silent , almost breathlessmoment , a moment which I 've never forgotten and which I know I never will forget . And then , very quickly , this moment passed as we all drank our toasts and as my Uncle Jimmy , standing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn and proud and small and oddly touching , drank the final toast to his boys , his family . Then , suddenly , the atmosphere lifted , everyone began to talk at once , and slowly the emphasis began to shift away from Charles and the election and today back to my Uncle Jimmy and back to yesterday . It became now my Uncle Jimmy 's evening , and it was Charles himself who led the way ; assisted by Phil , he encouraged his father to reminisce . When my Uncle Jimmy was in good spirits , as he so clearly was tonight , he could do this very well , and over the years I had several times sat in on and been entertained by his memories of coups and deals and behind-the-scenes stratagems which were apt to embrace everyone from members of the hierarchy to Greek shipping magnates to Presidents . My Uncle Jimmy 's view of history was that of the insider : he had been there . On the other hand , if he had not been there , he was not much interested ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as major or even critical by most observers , were in his personalized surveys severely diminished or simplyp172ignored . So that it was a special kind of history , as fascinating as it was unbalanced , and made even more special by my Uncle Jimmy 's unorthodox evaluations of the eminent men and women he had known . He was no respecter of reputations . He had few , perhaps no , heroes ; he had worked with many of the great and ultimately he had quarreled with them ; this intimacy had not bred awe . In my Uncle Jimmy 's history the footprints on the sands of time were mostly made by feet of clay . Tonight , probably in honor of Charles and the occasion , he talked largely about politics . He had never held elective or appointive office of any kind , but for many years he had contributedheavily to the Democratic party , he had ranged in and out of high Democratic councils , and although I do n't suppose he had ever really been a kingmaker , he had undoubtedly had his moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one President to help with specific financial problems , and when he mentioned this in passing now , Phil said , " I 'll tell you what I heard : I heard they used to call you the Irish Baruch . " My Uncle jimmy accepted this equably enough . " Okay , " he said . " I do n't get too mad at that . What was so wrong with Baruch ? He knew what it was all about . " I said , " I guess he must have . Still , I remember reading somewherethat while everybody always said he gave advice to Presidents , nobody really said whether the Presidents ever took it . " It was an ungenerous comment ; also , in view of the comparison that had just been established , it was an unwise one , and it did not go down well with my Uncle Jimmy . " Yeah ? " he said belligerently . " Well , I can clear that one up for you right now . They took it . They did n't take all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't as hot as he thought he was , not by a long shot . He always thought that after they made him they stopped making brains . All that magnolia bushwa . But he was okay . Mostly . And he had a hell of a lot more on the ball than those little left-wing wisenheimers that sat around picking theirp173noses and making dirty cracks at him . Listen , Baruch gave away more in tips to cab drivers in a week than those babies earned in ten years . " He stabbed a finger at Charles and said , " You 've got a few of them around you , boy . Big liberals , right ? They all bleed like hell for the poor Puerto Ricans and they boo hoo hoo all over the joint about civil liberties , but just say to them sometime you think you 'll drop over to the Pavilion for chow and then see what happens . They 'll kick each other to death trying to be first in line ! Watch yourself with that gang or you 'll all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guess who 'll be the pony ! " " I 'll bear it in mind , " Charles said , smiling slightly . I had the feeling that this ground had been covered before ; at any rate , he now gently changed the subject . " One question , Pa , " he said . " Of them all  --  and I 'm talking now just about the top men  --  which one did you like best ? " " Truman , " my Uncle Jimmy said instantly . " A good little guy . And not a bad President . He did all right with what he had . And if you did him a favor he did n't forget it . He was never a doublecrosser , and that was some switch in the White House in those days , because before Truman they had the world 's champ ! " This was perhaps his favorite theme : I had heard him often on the subject of his old special hate . Charles said , " All right . But supposing you left all likes and dislikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick one man of them all to be the President purely on the basis of capacity , of sheer ability  --  then what ? It almost has to be Roosevelt , does n't it ? " Surprisingly  --  or at least surprisingly to me  --  my Uncle jimmy agreed at once . " Sure , " he said . " And by miles . He had more soft spots than a banana , especially Iater on , but he ran the show . Not because he was smart or a genius or a great leader , but because he had what it took : he was a con man . It takes a con man to handle a country like this , and that 's what Roosevelt was all the way . He had those chowderheads down in Washington sitting there with their traps open catching flies while he kept on smiling and blow/ing smoke at them and telling them to guess which shell the pea was under . I did n't like him for a minute and you could never believe a word he said , but he was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever hand me that Great Man malarky . My friends .. " he said , derisively imitating the famous voice . " My friends my ass ! " " God bless us all , " my Aunt Gert said . " There are ladies present ! " And she laughed her great laugh . Phil said , possibly maliciously , " We have n't heard about the General . What about him ? " " Do n't make me laugh , " my Uncle Jimmy said . " Amateur night ! " Then , suddenly recalling something , he looked at me and said triumphantly , " But he showed all you birds something , right ? With that book of his he did n't write ? He got a capital gains deal out of it and made himself a bundle . Right after that they smartened up and locked the barn door and nobody else in your racket 's made a buffalo nickel that way ever since ! " It was true enough , but since my own books were seldom in that category where any capital gains provision would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and I do n't think I responded suitably . But this made no difference because my Uncle Jimmy , having delivered his thrust , saw no point in waiting for reaction , and simply moved on . His talk now took a different turn , for suddenly he left politics entirely and began to reminisce in a warmer , more personal way : he began to talk about the family , not as it was today , but as it had been when he and my father and my Aunt Gert were children together , growing up in the city and living in one of the many three-tenement houses which his father  --  unknown to them all  --  owned . I 've said that my Uncle Jimmy was not an emotional man , but now as I listened to him talking about those early days I was not so confident . Because I had been over substantially this same ground before , not with my Uncle Jimmy but with my father , and while my father had been in every way kinder and gentler , an infinitely more appreciativep175and sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family life had been much harsher , particularly when these memories had centered about his father . Whenever I thought of my grandfather I pictured him either as the tight , tough , essentiallytyrannical man of my father 's stories , or as the old , curiously mottled , largely silent little wisp of a man I had seen in my Uncle Jimmy 's castle in Ireland . It was hard to square the one picture with the other ; it was harder to square either with my Uncle Jimmy 's present and on the whole rather proud portrayal of the returned sailor who had settled down in the city of his birth to build a home , a fortune , a dynasty . " A hard nut , " he conceded . " But he came around in the end . We all got what was coming to us and a little more besides . He was rough in the clinches , but I learned a hell of a lot from him , and not just about do-re-mi , either . I learned about the family and how important it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you about the family : all for one , one for all . Right ? Well , I learned it from him : he was the original stick-together guy . And if you did n't want to stick together he beat it into you . Even from the time we were little kids with the ring of the pot still on our seats , if he ever caught you going outside saying anything about the rest of us , he gave it to you good . He would n't say a word ; he 'd just shoot you one of those looks and reach for the razor strap . I had a sore tail for ten years , but I wound up knowing what you could do if you all stuck together ! " My father must have had a sorer tail and for a much longer period of time , but with him the lesson , so fruitful and unforgettablefor my Uncle Jimmy , simply had not taken . My Uncle Jimmy made no reference to this now ; he went on filling in the picture of my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while a peculiarly sharp memory seemed to prod him and then he departed momentarily from benignity  --  but on the whole touching them up here and there , so that while there were glimpses of harshness and silent violence , what finally emergedp176was a hard but reasonably picturesque figure , whose stern example had taught his children the value of a dollar , and whose extraordinaryconcealment of his wealth from his own family for so long a time now seemed in retrospect an antic gesture , more eccentric than anything else , arising no doubt from a basic love of that family , and in any case more than atoned for by the healthy settlements made on each of his children . And as I listened I wondered whether there was any kind of truth in this at all  --  whether , that is , my Uncle Jimmy , so much closer to my grandfatherin his temperament and aims , could have caught qualities that my father had ignored or simply had not seen  --  or whether perhaps it might not be a matter of age , that as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that indeed something of the sort might have happened to my father if he had lived , so that their separate accounts of their father might by now have come closer together . But somehow I did n't really think so , and when I looked over at my Aunt Gert for some possible clue  --  for she was the only other member of the family who had memories of those early days , and certainly by the end she had come to know my grandfather better than had either of her brothers  --  she was no help at all . She was listening and seemed to be listening intently , but her large white poker face was set in its perpetual and rather pleasant mask of potential laughter . And so my Uncle Jimmy went on talking , leaving his father after a while and starting to rove at random through the past , and as he continued to do so with a kind of special gusto , and with smiles and laughter from us all  --  because , tonight , he seemed in really great form  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sometimes do on joyful occasions when there apparently is no reasonable excuse for sadness at all . I sat there for a few moments , not really knowing why I felt this way , still watching and listening to my Uncle Jimmy , but beginning to drift back over the evening , thinking of all the different and rather surprising things that had happened to me since I had arrived ,  |p177thinking  of Walshie and Edso and the extraordinary coalition of forces which had been brought together to celebrate Charles 's triumph in the room below , thinking of old memories of other and quite different political nights that had risen to the surface in me , thinking of Charles and Marie standing hand in hand together as though in the first of a series of official portraits , thinking just of Charles  --  Charles as Governor !  --  but thinking particularly , and for no special reason , of that one brief instant when Phil and Charles had been talking together , so openly but so privately , too . Once again , as I thought back over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something was different , that something was going on I did n't understand  --  and once again I had the feeling that in this I was not alone , that unlikely as it might seem , especially since this was so obviously a family matter , my Uncle Jimmy was in the dark as well . Was he ? I did n't know , of course , but the feeling persisted , it was unavoidable , and yet at the same time the evidence right before my eyes pointed in just the opposite direction . For if he had even suspected that there were family secrets which were being kept from him , he would have been furious and deeply troubled , but now , certainly , no one seemed freer from troubles of any kind  --  so free , in fact , that suddenly and unexpectedly he began to dance . Or rather , to go into the beginning of a little clog step  --  it turned out that he was illustrating a point in a story about a small-time vaudevillian who had lived in the tenement above them more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-footed exuberance  --  although a small man , he was not a natural dancer  --  and as he danced he sang in a jaunty nasal voice : She 's the daughter of Rosie O'Grady A dear little old-fashioned girl ... . He was not a natural singer , either , but sheer energy carried him through : it was impossible to pull away from this vitality , thisp178challenging bounciness . And so here he was , at the moment of my conviction that the focus was somehow slipping away from him , as happy as I had ever seen him , clogging his way through memories , the undisputed center of family doings . Charles was sitting , completely relaxed now , next to Marie ; one hand rested lightly on her knee . Phil was standing , half-smiling , behind Flossie , who seemed to have shed for the moment the faint overlayof distress she always brought with her to these family gatherings ; my Aunt Gert was as expressionless as ever , but she was humming and tapping the floor with one fat little foot ; I saw Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition of some gesture or piece of business on the part of their father that I failed to catch . It was a complete , unified , strong family scene , all pulled together and made what it was by the same powerful little presence who had always been able to do this , and under the impact of this cohesiveness , this visible shared enjoyment , my own strange feeling of disquiet began to disappear . Soon after this Charles and Marie left to return to their party downstairs  --  it was an indication of the strength of the family atmosphere that for the past few minutes I had forgotten completelythe real reason for our being all together tonight . As she was leaving Marie came over to me and said , " Back to the lions . Jack , are we going to see you ? " " I hope so . I 'll be around , at least for a while . " " Well , so will we . After the first , that is ; we 're going off tomorrow for about three weeks . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to all the places I love . Paris for a week , then down to Rome for two . This late it 'll probably rain every day in Rome , but I could n't care less . We 'll have Bill and Pony Brady 's house , and you ca n't do much better than that . Want to come along ? " " Not this year , " I said . " It 's not fashionable enough : everybody 's going to Greece . " " I know : all that good clear light , " she said . " We were therep179last year , in the islands . It was beautiful , all right , but I do n't know , I 'm not mad about beautiful places where I ca n't speak the language and I do n't like the food . And of course I fool people : they all think I want to put on a bathing suit and go skin-diving or water-skiing , and I do n't . My idea of heaven is to be absolutely comfortable in an elegant apartment in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " listen , Jack : you would n't do yourself a favor , would you ? And give Jean a call ? " It was one of her quick blunt shifts to the personal which I 'd never handled very well and which , instinctively , I tried to duck ; I shook my head slightly and said , " Come on , Marie . . . . " " MYOB ? " she said . " When I was in grade school that was the hot slang for Mind Your Own Business . Come on yourself , Jack : do n't be so stuffy . She 's a good girl . And do n't try to tell me that old one about not knowing where she is , because I know where she is , and if I do , you do . . . . " " If I do you do what ? " Charles said , coming up and putting his hands on her smooth shoulders . " Jack 's getting in a stew , " she said , " because I 'm interfering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea , " Charles said . " Why do n't you stop interfering in his domestic affairs and start interfering in mine ? To the extent of going downstairs and acting like a Radiant First Lady . " " That 's what the newspapers call me now , " she said , turning to me . " Do n't you love it ? " " And while you 're radiating , " Charles said , " tell them I 'll be down in a minute . Also , you might tell Jerry I want to see him in the study before I go down . " She made a face at him , kissed his cheek , and said , " All right . " As she left she said to me , " Anyway , think it over . What can you lose by being nice ? " Charles watched her go and said to me , not at all as any kind of an apology , but as a plain statement of fact , " She 's always likedp180Jean . And they keep in touch , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then . " I said , " Your wife 's a romantic girl . " " I know , " he said . " But why not ? She 's had good luck that way : all the best things that have happened to her have been what I suppose you 'd call romantic . Tonight , for example . " With one hand he made a large , all-inclusive gesture , taking in the room , the family , the party downstairs , the entire occasion . " This is pretty heady stuff , " he said . I said curiously , " For you , too , Charles ? " He nodded at once . " Sure , " he said . " I 'm not that blase . " He gave me a quick amused smile and said , " I find it easy to be dazzled by my own achievement . By the way , how did you make out with the Commander ? Did you have a pleasant chat ? " " Fascinating . Thanks a lot . " " I thought it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the new politics some things have n't changed . " " Including techniques , " I said , and I told him now what I had suspected at the time : that in diverting the Commander to me he had deliberately been using an old Skeffington ploy . " Oh , " he said , " I 'm not above borrowing techniques . Especially if they work . Incidentally , I do n't share Pa 's feeling about your old boss . I do n't buy the legend , either , but he was better than Pa thinks . He knew how to get elected most of the time , and he knew how to maneuver all of the time . I 'd say a man who could do that was a pretty fair politician . " I said , " That is n't exactly the same thing as saying that he was a pretty fair governor , is it ? Or mayor ? " " I guess it is n't , " he said pleasantly , " but then , I guess he was n't . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Do you really think he was , jack ? " I said , " That 's the old argument , is n't it ? I 've heard it ever since the first day I met him . I do n't know how good he was . I do know that he 's the only one who ever did anything . And I knowp181that if I just look around this city today , about every major improvementI can see  --  buildings , tunnels , roads , playgrounds  --  was started or finished or helped along by one man . So I guess that 's a kind of answer , is n't it ? " " For someone who quit politics in disgust , " he said , " you 're surprisingly loyal to old politicians . Or at least to one old politician . Although I would n't mind betting that has n't much to do with politics . " He added shrewdly , " It 's probably all personal . Anyway , I know those major improvements . Or those of them you can see : half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor pals did n't always use the best materials . By the way , you never happened to look at the city 's books for the years all this improvingwas going on , did you ? " I said defensively , " Crooked books , I imagine ? " " No , " he said , " not crooked . You 're behind the times , Jack : you believe in the legend . I do n't want to strip this picturesque old figure of even a shred of his glamour , but he was n't the great quixotic crook people still think he was . The awful fact is he was n't a crook at all . Or not much of a one . By the standards of his time , that is : remember that those were the days of honest graft . ' But the books were n't crooked . They were worse : they were in-credible . " " I 'm not too surprised . I do n't think bookkeeping was his strongest point . " " I 'd agree with that , " he said dryly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall I thought I 'd better have a look at the records , just to see what had been going on . Well , to begin with , I had to find them . It was n't easy , as you can imagine , but they finally turned up in some side room as dark as a closet , full of old newspapersand sneakers and underwear and , naturally , the official records of the city . All this was presided over by a little old Irishmanwho 'd been there forever and who  --  again naturally  --  could n't read . I got the books out , I had the city 's accountants go over them , and then I put Pa 's people to work . It all added up to onep182thing : Skeffington had no financial sense at all . None . He could n't have known the first thing about money . Except that you took it in and you paid it out , from anyone and to anyone , and of course it became a matter of policy to pay out more than you took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was the way he ran the state . And it never hurt him for a minute . Not many people knew about it , and most of those who knew did n't care . That 's the way things were then . He was very popular , and that 's what elections were around here in those days : popularity contests . " I thought of his own enormous margin of victory ; I said , " And you do n't think they are today ? " " Sure they are , but there 's a difference , is n't there ? " he said . " It 's not that simple any more . Look at it this way : yesterday I got eighty-five thousand votes more than Skeffington did on his best run . Of course we have more voters now , but there are a few things left you ca n't blame on the population explosion . My percentage of the total vote was still way ahead of his . And why ? Because I 'm more popular now than he was then ? " He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that . Nobody 's got that kind of popularity any more . It was a personal thing that depended on tribal loyalties , immigrants on the way up , racial spokesmen , Communion Breakfasts -- there 's some of that still around , of course , but in Skeffington 's campaigns it was the big thing . You could do very well for yourself if you could get up and tell a few funny stories , quote Robert Emmet , and shout Ireland must be free ! ' for a finish . Today it 's slightly more complicated . " " You need a whole new set of quotations , " I said . " That 's right . Among other things . " " Which ones ? Who are you quoting these days , Charles ? " " Roosevelt , George Washington Carver , Ben-Gurion , " he said imperturbably . " And , just occasionally , Robert Emmet . So as not to slight a minority group . And then on another level , and because I have an extremely well-read staff  --  you 've heard about my support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexanderp183Pope . We try to box the compass , you see . " He gave me the look he had given me twice before , and said , " Quotation-wise . " It was to me a curious and a fascinating conversation  --  curious because although the room was still full of family , Charles and I were talking in unbroken privacy : none of the others had even come our way . And yet I had no feeling that we were deliberately being " let alone " ; it was rather as if the general family atmosphere had relaxed with the finish of my Uncle Jimmy 's centralizing performance , and the party had split up into little groups , each one returning for a moment to its own habitual concerns . Phil and Flossie had gone over by the fireplace where Phil was talking in a low voice , and Flossie was listening and slowly pulling on her gloves . Directly above their heads on the rear wall hung a large painting which I had noticed earlier , but which I looked at more carefully now . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some special significance for me , but just for the moment I could n't place it , pin it down . Then , suddenly , I remembered : it was the painting of my Uncle Jimmy in his Knight of Malta costumethat I had last seen so many years ago in his Irish castle  --  had it now been permanently transferred to Charles 's house ? My Uncle Jimmy himself had moved from the center of the room and had joined my Aunt Gert who , having been silent for most of the evening , was now talking emphatically to him ; I gathered that this might be business , for she did not at this time seem to be on the point of any merriment . What she was telling him must have been of some importance , for he was listening without his customaryimpatience , but even so , every once in a while I saw him shift his head just slightly and flick a fast inquisitive look in our direction . It was not his habit to be left out of anything , not even for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Aunt Gert was saying was significant enough to keep him with her , I knew that he ached to be over here with us , listening to his son . He might have been surprised by what he heard  --  although , come to think of it , perhaps not . I was . Not by anything Charlesp184had said  --  for by now I did n't really care whether Skeffington had been a great governor or a good mayor or even a financial responsible ; it was all in the past , and whatever he had been could n't modify my affection for someone who had been unfailingly kind to me , and with whom it had been such great fun and so exciting for a young man to be , day after day  --  but by the authority , the easy confidence with which he said it . The same man who , twenty years ago , had known nothing about politics and who could hardly bear to sit through my stories about Skeffington and City Hall and local politicians , was now calmly setting me straight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general . It was a queer reversal , more than a little incongruous , and yet as I listened to him talk , so easily , so surely , so peculiarly impressively , I did n't think of this at all . What I did think of was that Charles seemed to have changed far more than I had suspected , and I think it was only now , in these few moments of talk , that I began to realize what I suppose I should have realized long before : that Charles was in f act the Governor , and that as Governor , and as the man who had worked to become Governor , he was a different and indeed a far more formidable figure than the Charles I had always known . But all this came from a manner , an attitude , a presence , for there was certainly nothing formidable in anything he said . He talked on casually , apparently in no hurry at all  --  although of course he knew very well that everyone downstairs was waiting for his reappearance . Just as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to wait : in this gathering no one was likely to go home imprudently . He said to me , " It 's all changed , in every way . It 's a matter of style as much as anything else . Frank Dooley is a good example . Do you remember him ? " " Vaguely . I remember the family , of course . " The Dooleys had been a conspicuous political family : Frank Dooley 's grandfather had been a ward boss , his father had run the state senate , his uncle had been a Superior Court judge for decades . But Frankp185himself . . . I said , " He has n't done well , has he ? Was n't he supposed to be a corner ? It seems to me they used to talk about him that way . " " He 's old hat , " Charles said . " He 's actually younger than we are , but people think of him as an old-fashioned poi , and that 's the kiss of death these days . He had all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's a good talker , and his father sensed which way the wind was blowing in time to send him to a non-Catholic college . The first Ivy Leaguer in his family . The New Breed . But it did n't work . He got to the City Council and that 's as far as he 'll ever get . He wants to be attorney general and he would n't be a bad one . He 's reasonably bright , he 's not bad on civil liberties  --  that 's the big thing today , by the way  --  and he does n't steal . But the minute he leaves the ward he 's done . As soon as he gets in a campaign he starts talking like his father . He starts out on the rights of the Negro to equal employment opportunityand then , before he can stop himself , a bit of a brogue creeps in , a God love you ! ' slips out , and that kills him . He just reminds people of yesterday . Thirty years ago he would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way it 's a pity , because he could be useful to someone . " " But not to you , I gather . " He shook his head . " No , not to me . There 's too much going against him . Too many drawbacks . Including the fact that in the primary he nearly killed himself trying to stop me from getting the nomination . I guess I think of that as a drawback . " " No magnanimity , Charles ? " " I know the word , " he said . " It 's sometimes pronounced folly : " He smiled again and said , " It 's too bad you ca n't talk to your old friend . He could tell you all about that . " " How about Skeffington ? " I said . " How does he fit the changing-styletheory ? You do n't think he 'd do well if he ran today ? " " You used to be a vaudeville buff , " he said . " Remember a thing called Change Your Act or Go Back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks like that , " he said . " He 's very bright and he knows a lot , but he makes one mistake : he thinks ecumenicismhas reached Ward Five . No , it still matters . There 's a surface civility , and it 's not as obvious as that old magic scream , He 's one of our own ! ' but it 's there , all right . And it 's respected : just look at the careful assortment of trash at the head table of the average interfaith dinner . Jack got to be President , but by a hair : he was almost licked by it . Oddly enough , in this situation , it benefited me . And then of course I was lucky in my opponent . He could have won , but first he got clumsy and then he panicked . And finally , I had another advantage . I know I wo n't shock you when I tell you that to win cost money . Fortunately I had it . And I used it . " I had heard , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this had been the most expensive campaign in the history of the state , and now I could n't resist going to authority . I said , " How much money , Charles ? " " A lot , " he said . " I wo n't tell you more than that because I really do n't want to shock you . " Again there was the slight smile and he said , " I want you to preserve your illusions . Anyway , I won  --  and I know why I won . And having won , I think the idea is that Pm supposed to run the state . I can do that all right , but it wo n't be easy . I told you earlier tonight that being Governor was a little like being mayor , only more so . It 's the more so ' that counts . I used to deal with the City Council ; now I 'm going to have to deal with the legislature  --  which is bigger , tougher , smarter , more complicated , and impossible as it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have a certain amount of experience , and I 'm not exactly unarmed . Although I could use a few helping hands . " " I thought you had plenty of those , " I said . " What everyone seems to be talking about is your organization , and how strong it is . " " They 're very good , " he said . " They 're all competent . Some ofp189them are more than that . And a few of them I can even trust . You ca n't reasonably ask for more than that . What I would n't mind having around is someone closer , someone I can not only trust , but whom I 've known  --  and who 's known me  --  for a long time . I have a feeling there are times when that 's important . Even indispensable . " He smiled again and said , " Maybe I 'm getting like Pa : the sense of family . " I said , " You could n't do better in that department : you 've got Phil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Phil is one man , and one man , even if he 's as good as Phil , ca n't be everywhere , and ca n't do everything . Besides , Phil is ... my conscience , I suppose . Or so it appears . " He hesitated just a bit in the middle of saying this , and after he had said it he hesitated again , as if he were going to say something more along the same line . But he did n't ; he said only , " If you ever change your mind , or if you feel like talking about it again , let me know . You ca n't tell , you might get something out of it at that . Something you could use in a book . If worse came to worst , you could even use me . I understand , " he said , the dryness coming into his voice once more , " others are planning something of the sort . The difference is that I might not sue you . Anyway , think it over . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to change anything : probably he knew this , too  --  and he left , slippingquickly out of the room with just a wave at the others . As he did , my Uncle Jimmy came over beside me and for just a moment did n't say anything but stood looking at the door which Charles had closed behind him . I did n't know when he had left my Aunt Gert  --  during the last few minutes I had been too interested in what Charles was saying to look around at anyone else  --  but now I saw that she had joined Flossie underneath the Knight of Malta painting , and that Phil seemed to have disappeared . There was another way out of the library ; I wondered if he had left by it , to be with Charles downstairs.  |p190My  Uncle Jimmy pointed to the door and said proudly , " Some kiddo , right ? " I agreed , and he said , " It 's his night to howl and that 's jake with me . He 's earned it . He 's a great boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " He seemed to be back in his mood of earlier this evening , when he had spoken so emotionally of his satisfaction in his family . He said , " You talk to James at all ? " " Just long enough to say hello . He was on his way out when I came in . " " A funny kiddo , " he said . " He could have been anything . Doctor , lawyer , businessman , politician : you name it . And he double-crossed me and became a priest . Well , who wanted that ? Hah ? He was my oldest boy and he had a hell of a lot on the ball . You think I wanted to see him planked down on his can in some rectory in the sticks , playing Parcheesi every night and watching the ball games on TV ? I tell you , I raised hell when it happened . I went to the bishop and asked him if he thought we were some kind of Shanty Mick family that had to hand over a boy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must have enjoyed that . " " He got thick , " my Uncle Jimmy said . ' Well , what could you expect ? He 's a Shanty Mick himself . And that 's the way it happenedwith him : I know the whole story . I would have belted him right in the puss , bishop or no bishop , but he yanked out that cross he wears and started waving it around . Anyway , it all wound up okay . Look at James : today he 's all over the world and everybody knows him . Who else in his racket can do what he does ? One minute he 's up in Alaska singing Holy God , We Praise Thy Name ' with a crowd of Eskimos that never did anything but swap reindeer bones until he came along . The next he 's in Kansas City glad-handing a convention of Presbyterian chumps . The next he 's in Rome listening to the Pope asking him , What 's new ? ' I tell you , if those Guineas over there have got anything besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . And fast ! "  |p191First  Charles , then James ; idly , almost automatically , I said , " And then there 's Phil . . . . " But my Uncle Jimmy snapped this up the instant it was said . " What about Phil ? " he said truculently . It was possible that he saw in the question an attempt to hurry him along in a family narrative ; more probably , though , he suspected what certainly had not been intended : an implied criticism of one of his boys . For it was Phil with whom my Uncle Jimmy felt least secure  --  or so it had always seemed to me . He was more complex , less clear of outline , harder to figure out : also , by any popular standard , he had not done as well as the others . This was curious , because I had always thought that of the three boys it was Phil who was the most naturally gifted . Whatever he had done , he had done with the appearance of ease ; in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had always done well ; teachers  --  even those who had not been eager to placate my Uncle Jimmy  --  had praised him and spoken of his extraordinary promise . He had gone through college and law school in the same effortless way ; like Charles , who had followed him a year later , he had gone on to practice law , but unlike Charles he had at once made his mark as a remarkably good lawyer . He was at his best in a courtroom , preferably caught up in the midst of some incredibly complicated trial , preferably questioning some hostile , positive , slightly pompousand supposedly unshakable expert : two or three times , years ago , I had gone to court just to watch him in such circumstances . He had given a fine performance on each occasion , with his fresh vivid intelligence vibrating through every sentence he spoke , with his old gift for mimicry now and then flashing out to disconcert the witness and delight the rest , and with a kind of swooping sardonic good humor overriding everything so completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in watching the trial , you were aware of very little else but Phil . It seemed to me in those days that he went to his work with a special feeling for what he did : not merely pride but a positive joy . He was popular and respected ;  |p192his  fellow lawyers , like his early teachers , had predicted the arrival of great things for him . And yet  --  the great things had not arrived . They had not arrived  --  I think  --  mainly because Phil had stopped pursuing them . He had been in great demand , but gradually he had given up responding to this demand : he took fewer and fewer cases . There were those who said that he had grown lazy ; there were others who said that , thanks to his father , he was already a rich man and therefore had no need to work ; and there was Phil himself who , one day , about a year before Charles decided to try his luck in politics , had given me a somewhat different explanation . " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as simple as that . I got bored with a job that a couple of years ago suddenly began to seem silly and then with the passage of time got even sillier . Who was it who said , The law is a ass ' ? Someone in Dickens , I know , but who ? Pumblechook ? You ought to know , you 're the literary man . Anyway , he was dead right , and it gets assier by the second . You would n't , you could n't , believe how absolutely trivial it is unless you were mixed up in it every day . And it 's all the same . Take the case I wound up last week , the one I got saddled with thanks to Charlie Murphy 's very convenient double hernia . My client turned out to be a Mafia hood : the real article , a doughy little olive-eyed thug , a genuine **49;6912;TOOLONG . He 'd probably knocked off twenty or so of the usual business competitors on his own . Eventually the government decided to go after him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same old comedy . It 's like getting McCarthy for disrespect to the Senate . So off we started , playing charades , with this IBM clown from the Feds licking his chops over missing fifty-dollar vouchers and improperly kept expense accounts , with my client 's pleasant associates slipping in every now and then to tell him the good news that in spite of all the hard luck the stuff ' was still moving , with my little killer himself whining to me that if he got sent up even for a day it would probably kill his littlep193Angela who was making her First Communion at Saint Anthony 's next month , and with the presiding justice on the bench nobody else but Breezy Willie Magee : seventy-nine years old , an alcoholic , a party hack all his life , and who in those rare intervals when he 's fully awake suspects  --  God knows why !  --  that the case has something to do with dirty books ! " I had said , " How 'd you make out ? " He had shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really care . By that time it all seemed so absurd that I would n't have been surprised if that old imbecile Magee had stood up and announced that he was going to reach his decision by picking the petals off a daisy . In one way there was a certain beauty to it , though . The hood was grateful : he cried . I was invited to watch little Angela receive . And I imagine from now any time I need a trigger man . . . . " He sighed and said , " No , I think the old Romans played it right : they had no lawyers . It was every man for himself , and not a bad idea . " " Then why not leave the hoods alone ? Switch around , go in for something else : civil liberties cases , that sort of thing .... " " I told you , they 're all the same , " he had said wearily . " I 've had a few respectable clients in my time . Including Pa . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity , the words words words , the appeals : it all adds up to nothing  --  or almost nothing  --  and what 's more important is that it bores the bejesus out of me . I used to get a charge out of it , but either it 's changed or I have . It 's probably me . Anyway , now whenever I see two lawyers in a court  --  and especially when I 'm one of them  --  all I can think of is two little men standing on the seashore , taking turns peeing into the Atlantic . They 're having a contest : the judge is an old man somewhere on the coast of Japan who decides the winner by measuring the mean high tides in the Pacific . It 's all about as meaningful as that . No , I 'll keep my hand in  --  or I expect I will : it 's what I know best , and it 's a bit late to break new tracks  --  but it 's not for me . It 's not really what I want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly I had become aware that he had changed very much , that the old merrinesswas not much in evidence now , and I did n't know why and I was genuinely concerned  --  I had said , " What is for you , Phil ? What do you want ? " " Oh , " he said , slowly , " I do n't know . Something I have n't got , I guess . And I have got a good wife and kids I love , so it has to be something else , does n't it ? Something I can get interested in enough to get lost in occasionally . Not that I want to get lost , particularly , but it would be nice to have something worthwhile losing yourself in , would n't it ? I expect that 's all I want . " And then his face had suddenly lightened , there was a return of the old high spirits , and he laughed and said , " In other words , somethingunreasonable ... I had known him for most of my life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my closest friend , yet he had often puzzled me : there had been those times when I felt that as well as I knew him I had never really , entirely , grasped him . I 'm sure that my Uncle Jimmy , while at moments enormously proud of him , must often have found him maddening and all but incomprehensible . Publicly of course he would never have said a word , but I knew that he and Phil had frequently had their explosions , and once he had expressed his baffled exasperation to me . " What drives me nuts , " he had said , " is that he 's as good as the best , and better than that if he wanted to be . But who knows what he wants ? Rah ? What the hell is all this mumbo jumbo about wanting something but he does n't know what ? Who 's he trying to kid , anyway ? For the love of Pete , he 's not some teen-age kid on a bicycle : he 's nearly forty years old ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anger in his face , but also another expression which was much rarer for him : one of puzzlement , of troubled inquiry ; he had said , " You think he is kidding ? " From all this I gathered that for some reason of his own Phil had told his father approximately what he had told me , althoughp195why he had done this was a mystery  --  perhaps he had been tired or irritated or caught off guard . For no one understood my Uncle Jimmy more completely than Phil , and of course no one knew better how unlikely he was to sympathize with hesitations or selfquestioning . My Uncle Jimmy had stood there , waiting impatientlyfor me to say something  --  it was one of the few times when he had asked me a question and really wanted an answer  --  and so I had said , " No , I do n't think he 's kidding at all . I think he 's probably just looking around and wondering a little . That 's not so wrong , is it ? " I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had howled . " At his age ? What 's up with you : have you gone bats , too ? Listen , by the time you 're as old as he is anybody that does n't know what he wants is halfway home to the booby hatch , and you can put that in your pipe and smoke it ! It burns me up ! Here 's a kiddo as sharp as a tack and as nifty a lawyer as ever walked into this burg , and what does he do ? He shoves himself up off his can and down into court maybe once a month , and the rest of the time he stays home playing beanbag with Flossie and waiting for some half-assed Good Fairy to tell him what he really wants ! Well , that kind of baloney goes over with me like a lead balloon ! He 'd better wise up in a hurry , that 's all I 've got to say . I 'll tell you one thing : I did n't raise anybody to be a second-rater ! " This was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not been repeated . I doubt that it would have been in any case  --  my Uncle Jimmy , I think , must have had sharp regrets at having so impulsively blasted one of his boys , even if he had done so only to me-but now Phil had suddenly made his move : he had astonished everyone and delighted my Uncle Jimmy by doing a complete turnabout . It had happened in this way . Shortly after my talk with my Uncle Jimmy , Charles had decided to run for mayor . It had been a family decision rather than a purely personal one , and in this decision Phil had participated . He had of coursep196been asked to help in the campaign , and he had of course agreed . Then had come the surprise . Almost at once what had started as a dutiful fraternal service , a matter of family obligation , evolved into something much more than that . Phil , whose interest in local matters had been greater than Charles 's but still not much more than casual , now had found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the possibilities of political control and reform , and although  --  as he had said to me on that hot night years ago , when we had driven home from the beach together and had stopped for supper in the awful cafeteria  --  he had no ambition for himself in office , his vision of what could be done if the right person was in power was an overwhelming one . There was no question in his mind but that Charles was the right person . The fact that he was Charles 's older brother could not have mattered less to him . He was not an envious man , and he was extremely clear-sighted ; he was sure of his own gifts and knew very well what he could do and what he could not do ; he knew that although he was a far better lawyer than his brother , Charles in his turn had talents which he did not possess : he was in fact the first member of his family  --  perhaps even before Charles himself  --  tocorrectly assess those talents and to see where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only joining Charles 's campaign but taking over its direction . He was acute , energetic , not easily fooled ; he was an excellent organizer , able to cut with quick decision into the fat and the flab that always bulks and swells behind a candidate ; his work at the bar had given him varied connections which now proved most valuable . He had become not merely Charles 's second in command but the ideal complement to him , and more than anyone else  --  more than my Uncle Jimmy and , some said , at this stage of the candidate 's career , more even than Charles  --  he had been responsible for that first victory . Ever since that time , although he had continued to maintain a token law practice , he had been with Charles . He believed in him ; he was as close to being indispensable as onep197man can be to another . This was a fact acknowledged by many , and among those who had always acknowledged it was Charles . It was also acknowledged by my Uncle Jimmy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerency , he realized of course that of all people I was not likely to talk Phil down , and all he said was , " Why should I tell you about Phil ? You know as much about him as I do . You know what he does . I tell you , those two make a great team . They 're going places together . " Then , without breaking stride or changing his tone , he said , " I saw you gabbing with Charles just now . For a long time . He offer you a job ? " And from his expression I could n't tell whether he knew this , that it was something he and Charles had talked over beforehand , or whether it was merely a shrewd guess . I said , " Not exactly . We sparred around the edges a little , but there was nothing definite . " " Do n't give me that nothing definite ' crap , " he said . " Who cares about that , hah ? He asked you to get on board , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " More or less , I guess . You 're not too surprised at that , are you , Uncle Jimmy ? " " Listen , " he said , " I gave up being surprised when I was still wearing knickers . I knew then that there were some people you could hit in the mouth with a sack full of gold and they 'd spit it all out into the gutter because it did n't taste good . You ca n't change people like that any more than you can teach a pig to pick cherries . Your old man was one of them and so are you . But I do n't get sore at that any more . I just wish for once in your life you 'd wise up and latch on to something when it 's handed to you . What 's the percentage in staying a boob ? " " You want me to hitch my wagon to a star , Uncle Jimmy ? " But he had said his piece ; he was not now interested in persuadingme further . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night and I 'm sure he was tired . It was not often that I thought of my Uncle Jimmy as getting along in years , but now I noticed signsp198of fatigue in his little , ageless , combative face . He said only , " I want you to use the squash God gave you . But if you want to be stubborn it 's up to you , Buster . It 's no skin off my tail . " And absentmindedly , he had done something I had never known him to do before : he had called me by the nickname he had always called my father . He looked at his watch and said , " I do n't know about you but I 'm going downstairs with Charles while he spouts his piece to all those free-loaders . Then I 'm going to come back up and hit the hay . I 've got to get out of here early in the morning ; I 'm going to Ireland . " And of course that was where I had my first real memory of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle , Uncle Jimmy ? " He nodded . " God knows why . It 's a dump . There 's nothing to do over there but go out in the rain and get wet . But Mary  --  your aunt  --  liked it so I go back now and then . Then I get the hell out . Fast . Thank God for the jets . " He looked at me inquiringly and said , " You do a little traveling : you ever get over that way ? " " No , only to touch down at Shannon now and then . And once I stayed in Dublin a couple of weeks , but that was years ago . " It had been in fact on our honeymoon : Jean and I had gone there , just as my father and mother had a generation before . We had had a wonderful time ; we had been very happy . I said , " I have n't been in Ireland now for a long time . " " You 're not as dumb as I thought you were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place open all the time . A Mick farmer and his wife look after it for me . God knows what they do with themselves when I 'm not around . Throw potatoes at each other , I guess . And sleep : everybody in that damned country sleeps fifteen hours a day . At least ! " And suddenly , for no reason , the name Teddy came leaping into my mind , and instantly I remembered the long-faced Irish chauffeur who used to drive James and Charles and Phil and me all around the country on rainy days , and whom my Uncle Jimmy had fired in one of his rages . I said , " Whatever happened to Teddy , Uncle Jimmy ? Remember him ? "  | " Sad Sam , " he said promptly . " I tied the can to that baby in a hurry , but I had to hire him back . He was strictly n.g. but he was better than the others . The clown I got in his place lost the carburetor . How the hell you can do that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the car right into the ocean . With me in it ! So I got Sad Sam back . Your aunt liked him okay . He 's dead now . TB . They 've all got it over there , it 's in the milk . But anyway , " he said , " if you get over , look me up . I might be there . " I promised I would , and once again he swung his fist in a mockpunchat my arm ; this time it was in farewell . " Keep the faith , " he said , and his tone was sardonic . " That 's always the Big Goodbye in this burg , right ? " He went off , stepping peppily across the room , going down to share the final big moment of the night with his son . It was his night as well as Charles 's , he was obviously on top of the world , and yet on this night when he was so happy  --  when one of his great dreams had come true for him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been talking to me , and now as I watched him walk away so jauntily , I found myself thinking of him not as I usually did , as I had always done , but instead wondering if in fact my Uncle Jimmy , in spite of his family and all his activities and his dreams beginning to come true , was not quite often a fairly lonely man ... . But it was late , and in a few minutes I left too , saying goodbye to Flossie and my Aunt Gert , who by now were the only members of the family remaining in the library . As I went down the stairs I could see immediately that it was now no trick to either enter or leave the house : the front hall which had been bursting with people an hour earlier was now completely empty . Not that the party had grown smaller ; it was now larger than ever , but the cargo had shifted : all those who had been out on the fringes , eating and drinking and talking together out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staircase , had now pushed their way into the ballroom , aware that the moment was at hand when the new Governor would tell them what they had come to hear : that hep200had won because of them . They were jammed so tight in the big room that it seemed , literally , that if anyone had dared to lift a hand or twitch a shoulder everyone in the room would have shivered in pain . Nothing was clearer than that if only some of the guests had chosen to stay here in the hall they would have been far better off : they would have heard more , they would have seen more , they would have done both in some degree of comfort . But this did not matter : what did matter was the feeling , apparentlycommon to all such gatherings at all such climactic moments , that it was enormously important to be physically as close as possible to the man who was shortly to say precisely what everyonepresent knew was to be said . Standing on the bottom step of the stairs , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians had now been pushed back into a little clump against the wall . Separated from them by the distance due his leadership was Shep Nomad : plump , ever-smiling , watchful , he seemed frozen into a posture of anticipationand delight at a point just halfway between " the boys in the band " and the handful of men who occupied the foreground . There was no music , there was no talk : there was just plain bedlam . Charles had stepped forward and was waving to the crowd ; if at that point he had said anything it could not have been heard over the shouts , the whistles , the great explosive spasms of applause . Suddenly , as if on a cue perceived by no one else , Shep Nomad dipped a plump hand , and from their cramped positionsthe musicians somehow managed to swing into " Happy Days Are Here Again , " followed by Charles 's campaign song . Impossibly , the noise from the crowd grew louder ; the music itself was now barely audible ; Charles , still standing in the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to smile and to wave . On the platform with him were Marie , my Uncle Jimmy , the new Lieutenant Governor , a monsignor whom I did not know , and three or four others  --  presumably figures of greater than usual significance in the campaign . The group wasp201joyous but incomplete : someone was missing and all at once I realized that of course it was Phil . He was nowhere to be seen , and I wondered where he could have gone at such a moment , and why ? But just then Charles turned to Marie , took her hand , and brought her forward ; she waved ; they stood arm in arm ; the band played the terrible song their leader had written for her ; there was more bedlam . Then she stepped to one side and my Uncle Jimmy came up , holding his hands clasped over his head like a victorious boxer . He stood between Charles and Marie , shorter than both of them , smiling happily ; suddenly he reached out with his arms and pulled his son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd stamped and cheered and screamed . Clearly this gesture of togetherness , made by the tough and famous little father of the family , was the high point of the evening so far . And down on the floor , right next to the bandstand , almost brushing Charles 's feet , one bright blue arm was raised in the air and waved about wildly : Edso , that experienced and well-nourished veteran of a hundred such occasions , had made it to the front and now was aching for his reward : a nod , a wink , a flick of a finger  --  any sign would do , as long as it came from the bandstand . The noise continued ; Marie and my Uncle Jimmy soon stepped back , leaving Charles alone before the microphone . He began , several times , to speak ; the crowd would not let him . He waited , smiling , never once putting up his hand , until gradually , very gradually , the cheers and cries and whistles began to die , and then there was only an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , at last , a silence which was deep , respectful , waiting , total . Out of this silence Charles began to speak , and as he did so I left  --  there would be no more surprises from now on . The big front door was open and I walked out into the cool night air . The state policeman on guard at the door nodded and said , " A great night . " I said , " A great night . " I walked out to the edge of the terracep202and stood there for a moment . There was no moon : in the dark night that part of the lawn which stretched away to my left seemed black rather than green , fading off into the even blacker and barely visible bordering trees . To my right all was brighter , lit by the still gay but dying fires of the Japanese lanterns . Even though it was much cooler now the breeze was pleasant , the sharpnessof full fall was not yet here , and so I stood there on the terrace , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , hearing Charles 's voice but not really getting what he was saying , and hearing too the applause that broke in on virtually every phrase . Out on the lawn half a dozen men moved silently and systematically about , clearing the tables , folding them up and carting them away , spearing the debris from the littered grass : the party was very nearly over . I watched for a few seconds more , and then I turned to go off across the lawn to my car when someone standing just behind me said , " It 's no fair to eat and run . You 're supposed to stay for the speeches . " It was Phil . Apparently he had been standing in the dark on the far side of the terrace when I had come out ; quietly he had come over to me . I wondered again why he was not where it seemed he should be at this moment ; I said , " You 're not in on the finale : how come ? " He said just what my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been a little different . " It 's Charles 's night . There 's a good reason for Pa and Marie to be up there with him . Not so for me , unless we 're out to establish our family solidarity , and I do n't think that 's required by now , do you ? " I said , " You 're selling yourself short : that 's new , is n't it ? My guess is that they want to see you up there with the others , that they even expect to see you . " " They 've seen me , " he said . " And they 'll see me again , do n't worry about that . They 're all good party workers and sooner or later they 'll all come around to find out what goodies are in the basket . And when they do , I 'll be the one they 'll have to see . Sop203I 'm in no danger of being overlooked . Besides , there 's another thing : it 's a matter of tactics . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone up on a platform with Charles  --  never , that is , when it was at all important or when he had something he wanted to get across ? That 's something we both agreed on  --  matter of fact , it was my idea . Know why ? " I did n't ; he said , " It 's obvious : we look too much alike . Or we remind people of each other , which comes to the same thing . Charles alone is fine ; Charles with me is vaudeville . Comedy stuff : all we 'd need is straw hats and ice cream pants . Charles could talk all he wanted to about Consolo or Corruption or Higher Minimum Wages or Lower Hospitalization Costs , but half of the crowd would simply be looking at us and saying to each other , Is n't it wonderful , Agnes : do you think they 're really twins ? ' You ca n't lick that ; it 's inevitable . So Charles appears alone . With pretty fair results . " I was suddenly curious to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Now that it 's over , did you think he 'd win all along ? " He nodded . " Sure . " " No doubts ? " " Doubts , yes , but only because you 're foolish if you do n't realize that accidents can happen . And probably will . But I knew that if we got our share of the breaks we were in , and in big . It was n't by any means as hard as the mayoralty fight , no matter what you may have heard . And neither one of us ever thought for a minute that it would be . Surprised ? " " Yes , a little . I would have figured Consolo as much tougher than that on past performance alone . " " The trouble with past performance is that it 's in the past . Everyone is over the hill sooner or later , and we thought Consolo had just about had it . He 'd lost a lot of support where he 'd always been strongest  --  with the Italians . When he first ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state who did n't vote forp204him : he was their boy . But everything changes , including Italians . We had polls taken , and every one of them showed that by now the Italians were getting tired . They did n't want just another Italian in there , they wanted a good Italian . Well , there just was n't one around  --  at least , not one who could run for governor . So they voted for Charles  --  I do n't suppose the Kinsella ' hurt there , by the way . It was the old confusion all over again . Remember : Hey , are you Irish or Eyetalian ? ' " I remembered : it was a family joke . When I was a boy in school I had often bitterly regretted having one of those names  --  Costello was another  --  which was subject to mortifying misinterpretation . In a way proud of the name because it was my father 's , my mother 's , I nevertheless longed for something clearcut : Sullivan , Murphy . But now , years later , ambiguity apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " when they ditched him he was dead . He had to be : without them he just did n't have the horses . Anyway , for my money he was always overrated . He had this reputation for almost supernal cunning : well , I had a couple of long sessions with him and I could n't see it . What I could see was a rather stupid man who 'd had almost supernal luck . And now the luck had run out and he had nothing  --  or very little  --  left . So that 's why I figured it would be easy . On top of which we got a few breaks , we had the organization , we had drive , we had the money . And we had Charles , " First things last ? I said , " In short , a breeze ? " " No , " he said . " Not a breeze . Damned hard work all the way . " " No fun ? " " Well , you know : a funny thing happened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always happening around here : the whole state 's a joke machine . But overall it did n't acid up to much fun : as I say , it was mainly hard work . Not fighting Consolo ; just keeping our own crowd in line . Which was no cinch , believe me. "  | " The celebrated coalition ? " " That 's right . Labor for Kinsella , Small Business for Kinsella , Ministers for Kinsella , Negroes for Kinsella , Professors for Kinsella , Conservatives for Kinsella , Liberals for Kinsella . And  --  inevitably  --  Independents for Kinsella . You name it , we had it . It took a little doing to get them all in under the same tent , but we did it . We put them all together and then we found out we had to do something more : we had to keep them all together . And the one way , the only way , we could keep them together was to keep them apart : as far away from each other as possible . A slight paradox . You follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hard to follow : the rivalries , the potential clashes , the hurt feelings and the jealousies inherent in this reluctantcombination were easily imagined . And now , again , I remembered the talk we had had on that night five years ago ; I said , " But is n't that more or less what you wanted ? You were out to take control away from the stumblebums by broadening your base : was n't that the whole idea ? " " That 's right . And we did . Of course we 've still got the stumblebums  --  youdo n't get rid of an army of hacks and grafters overnight , and they 're still important : look at Cogan , for one  --  but the point is they do n't have control any more . We have that . " " You and the coalition . " " Yes , but we run the coalition . With some difficulty , but we do . The real trouble is that each group wants Charles all for itself . Just by the way , nobody 's any worse there than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , they want the whole body . One hundred per cent : they want him for their very own , they want to serve him up for dinner , they want to eat him up . And failing him , I 'll do . Fortunately Charles is just about tooth-proof and I 'm not so soft myself , so we survive . But it 's not easy . " He sighed and said , " They all want something different : well , okay , you expect that . The Negroes , of course . They 're catching up and they 're shooting for everything now : fine . Maybe not fine , butp206understandable . The poor bastards have n't had a fair shake for so long that all they want to do is grab the dice and run . But you can deal with them  --  at least you can deal with whichever spokesmanyou 're talking to at the moment . And with them it all means something , it 's exciting , it 's real , and at least you feel you 're in the land of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shrugged , and I said , " The Professors ? You do n't love the eggheads any more , Phil ? " " There 's a certain kind of arrogance that puts me off , " he said . " I suppose we 're arrogant enough in our way , but it 's not that way . I talked to a couple of them here tonight : they have a rather peculiar idea of their own contribution to the campaign . The fact is that it was n't all that great . Do you know Kurt Vogelschmidt , for instance ? Have you met him ? " Switching to mimicry , he said , " Hall you as yet had zat disdigdt blesshure ? " " No . I know who he is , of course . " This owl-faced , mountainous refugee from savage European oppressions had come to America at the outbreak of World War II , Weighing close to three hundred pounds , paralyzingly articulate , he had bullied a succession of Midwestern political science faculties into helplessness until finally , ten years or so ago , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery . He had remained to teach and to talk , There were rumors that he had been on the point of beginning a distinguished political career in Vienna when the war had unhappily intervened ; these rumors remained rumors , but it was a fact that he was now one of the most vocal of academic political activists , and I remembered seeing his name heading a list of professors who had vigorously supported Charles . I said , " He 's ... what ? To the campaign , I mean . The Brains Trust ? The big theory man ? " " I 'll tell you just what he is , " Phil said . " He 's a waste of time . He 's my mistake . I got him in ; I thought he packed a little weight with the others . Well , he does . But not enough . Not enough , for example , to justify calling me every other night around one inp207the morning to tell me what he expects of Charles on the basis of his own keen analysis of Austria before Dollfuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline a strategy which would be just swell if only Consolo were Franz Josef ! At first I thought he was kidding ; by the time I caught on it was too late . And all the while , chirping away in the background  --  because she 's an intellectual type too , you see  --  is his charming wife Elli , who weighs a cool thirty-five pounds , has bangs , wears knee socks , lives in the past , loves Bart6k , hates supermarkets , and serves a special kind of iron strudel she bakes herself ! It 's ghastly beyond belief . It drives you right back to the stumblebums : I 'd a lot rather spend my time chewing the fat with One-Eyed Danny Geegan of the Police Athletic League . At least I 'm sure we got his vote . For all I know charming Elli wrote in one for Leopold Figl . " I said , " He 's dead , I think . " " That 's all right with me , " he said . Then he smiled quickly and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think this state is getting to me ? " " What about Charles ? " I said . " How does he get along with them ? " " Better than I do . That 's partly because I 'm with them more . But also he 's more patient and he 's developed this great selfcontrol . And that marvelous way of looking gravely attentive , as if he were really listening hard to what you were saying . That 's big magic in the academic league : they 're all talkers . And then they also misread Charles rather seriously . They know he 's not really one of them , but they think that in a way he is , they think he values them especially , and they think that now he 's the Governor they 'll all do very well . " " And they wo n't ? " " No , " he said soberly . " They ca n't : it 's not in the cards . Oh , they 'll do all right , but that 's not what they want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right up there with Charles , runningp208the show . They have n't got a prayer : Charles is much too smart to let that happen . He knows exactly what they 've given him , and he 'll make some sort of equivalent return : equivalent , but no more . Well , some of them will accept that , and others wo n't . But if they do n't , what are they going to do about it ? Support somebodyelse ? Who ? You see in a funny way they 're a little like the party hacks : they may not much like what 's happening to them , but where else are they going to go ? And nobody knows that better than Charles . " And suddenly it occurred to me to wonder what my Uncle jimmy had been doing while all this had been going on . He must have known of this wing of Charles 's support : did he ever meet with them , talk with them , discuss the details of an overall strategy ? It was a picture impossible to envision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't see much of them ; I kept them away from him as much as I could . You know : what could come out of that ? And as it turned out , Pa had a great time in the campaign : a ball all the way . " He added reflectively , " I do n't know , I guess you might say Pa in politics today is a mixed blessing . On the one hand you have all his energy , his savvy , the funds , the people who get behindyou : old pals of his you could n't get near otherwise , and who really can make a difference . On the other hand , he 's not quite used to the little delicacies that now have to be observed : he was born in a tougher age . So that sometimes , when he 's angry , he just lashes out and to hell with the consequences . And then you have to persuade him that the NAACP does n't look kindly on their members being called jigs . ' Plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a little hard for him to move over . Even when it 's Charles who 's supposed to be driving the horse . " I said , " Pitched battles ? " He nodded . " Now and then . Well , you know : inevitable . When Pa wants his way he leans hard . But in a more subtle way Charles is quite a leaner , too . So we had our moments . As you can guess . "  | " As everybody could guess , apparently . The papers were always full of the real inside dope about what happened at those highlevelpolicy meetings between the Boys and Pa . " " I know , I know . I read them all . Nothing was ever right . Where do you suppose the papers get their political writers , anyway ? They used to ship them over from the sports page in carload lots : where do they come from today ? The classified ads ? It 's pathetic . All that imaginary expertise .... If I read once , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me standing up to Pa , trying to beat him down on those old reactionary ideas he kept insisting on . Of course it did n't happen that way at all . He had plenty of reactionary ideas , but the point is that he 's also very skillful ; it 's only when you 're working with him on an operation like this you realize how quick and how smart he is . The truth is that he was right half the time . It was when he was wrong that we had trouble , because he was always more stubborn then . But it all worked out in the end . Probably because Pa wanted Charles Governor even more than he wanted his own way . And probably because on the things that really count Charles and Pa are n't as far apart as you might imagine . " And there was something in his voice as he said this  --  or rather , something missing from his voice  --  that brought me right back again to that night years ago when he had been filled with buoyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politics and the future . Now the future had arrived , but the excitement and the buoyancy seemed to have gone : on this night of triumph Phil was strangely muted , and I had no idea why . It may have been simply that he was tired , that this was the natural letdown after the long campaign . Or it may have been that as he became more deeply involved in the endless local political tangles and quarrels he saw no great reason for excitement , perhapsdiscovering that no matter what he and Charles and my Uncle Jimmy might accomplish , they could hardly work the miracles he had hoped for in the beginning . Or it may have beenp210merely that he was five years older now  --  or it may have been something entirely different , something I had n't even thought about at all . But in any case it bothered me , because once again , as he was talking , I felt again that same sense of disquiet that I had felt throughout all the family party : a faint uneasiness , a troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Jimmy and his family , and now I think that perhaps I may have showed something of what I felt , because I saw Phil suddenly give me a quick and curious look . But he said nothing , instead turning away so that he had his back to the house and to me ; he flipped his cigarette and it sailed in a long high curve out into the night , the little red spot of light landing somewhere on the dark lawn . He stood for a moment , looking out in that direction , and then he said slowly , " So there we are . Or rather , here we are . Around and around she goes , and where she stops , nobody knows . ' " He turned around again to me and said , " Who used to say that all the time ? Someone on the radio , was n't it ? " " Major Bowes , " I said . " The old Amateur Hour . " But it was a strange quote to dig out of the past , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happen to remember that ? I mean , the quote . " He shrugged . " I do n't know . It just came out of the blue . Bits and pieces from the past : you know the way they do . " With a quick grin he added , " Although I grant you that this was an odd one . Considering the moment . Winners are n't supposed to talk like that , are they ? Whatever happened to positive thinking ? " " Maybe it got used up in the campaign . " " Maybe . But to tell you the truth I was n't thinking about the campaign . Or politics . I guess I was thinking more in personal terms . " He seemed about to say something more , then stopped , and turned away again to look out across the lawn . I did n't say anything . It would have been difficult to know just what to say , but I had the feeling that he neither wanted nor expected me to . So I stood there , looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil not as he was now , but as he had been as a boy , and of how he had always been the most exuberant and the happiestone of all the family , and thinking too that we were both now . . what ? Middle-aged ? And by one of those queer tricks of association I found myself thinking not only of Phil or Charles or my Uncle Jimmy , but of jean and myself , and of how we had all and so unexpectedly changed . .. Gloomy thoughts in the silence . The silence out here on the terrace , that is ; inside the house Charles had finished his talk , the music had come up again , there were cheers and roars and a great burst of loud applause . I heard cries of " Speech ! Speech ! " and I wondered from whom this speech was demanded . My Uncle Jimmy ? Marie ? Anyone who would speak ? Nothing happened immediately ; then , gradually , the noise died down , and someone began to speak . Not Marie , not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard before . The voice was heavy , the articulation was none too clear , and although I could hear words I could n't understand what was being said . Phil had turned back to me again and was watching me as I listened ; after a moment he said , " The voice of the turtle , Cogan , Recognize it ? " I did n't , but that was n't surprising , because I had n't heard it in years , and I had hardly expected to hear it tonight  --  in this house , that is , and in this way . For Charles , I knew , despised Cogan , and while it may have been logical to invite him here  --  to a gathering that was , after all , political rather than personal  --  it was not quite so logical to serve him up in this position of preference . Puzzled , I said , " What 's that in aid of ? " " Class . We always like to lend the program class . " In the same dry voice he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused , and for just a moment I thought he had decided not to say anything more , but then he said , " It was an idea Charles had . All in the interest of party solidarity . He seemed to think it would be wise , " " And you ? "  | " Oh , " he said , " I guess I seemed to think it would n't . " I suddenly thought of Charles , earlier this evening , sayinglightly  --  thatthere were " cracks in the solid family wall , " and now , not because I was merely curious , but also because I think I was still troubled , I said , " More pitched battles ? " " Of a different sort , " he said . " Well , not really battles , because there are one or two areas where Charles is n't . . . persuadable . " Then he said , " It 's late , is n't it ? I 've got to go in and get Flossie . Jack , you 'll be around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think so , yes . " I wanted to learn more about those one or two areas , but I knew that I would n't  --  at least , not tonight . I said , " I can work here as well as anywhere else , and also the house needs touching up here and there . I 'd like to see to that before I go off again . So I 'll be around . " " We 'll get together , " he promised . He reached out and tapped me lightly with a forefinger on the upper part of my arm ; it was the way he had signaled his departure to me ever since we were boys . " See you soon , " he said . I said goodbye to him , and he walked with his long steps back across the terrace toward the house . He had nearly reached the door when I called out to him , and as soon as I did he stopped and stood , waiting . I had called because suddenly it seemed to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he stood waiting for me to say it , all I could think of was a clumsy , even rather foolish , " It 's all right , is n't it ? I mean , with you ? " " You ought to get together with Charles , " he said . " That 's more or less what he asked me a couple of hours ago . I must be radiating cheer . Anyway , the answer is yes : it 's all right . It 's even better than that : it 's fine . " He gave a little wave of his hand and said , " Thanks . " Then he went quickly into the house , and I was left alone on the terrace . It was darker now : the last of the Japanese lanterns had gone . Even in the darkness , though , I could see that the swiftly moving men had done their work , for all the tables had been taken away and of the great spreading quilt of debris only anp213occasional scrap of paper remained , blown by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim and deserted . The air was sharper , more seasonal , now , and in the moonless fall night there was a clear pale splattering of stars . Out in front , toward the street , there were now no shouts , no songs , no signs of activity : presumably the students and other sightseers had gone home . The only action came from within the house where , with Cogan , the speaking seemed to have come to an end , and the music was once more pounding out through the still open windows . A door at the far end of the terrace opened , and I saw a small group of people come out , the first sign that it was now permissible for the party to begin breaking up  --  although I knew it would be a long time yet before everyone called it a day . I waited until this first group had gone down the drive away from the house , and then I left the terrace and cut across the lawn to the side where I had put my car . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row ; to get to mine I had to detour around them . As I did so I heard , suddenly and very loudly , the sound of someone shouting , and almost immediatelyI saw a man come crawling on his hands and knees out from between two of the parked cars . He was about fifty feet away and he was not alone ; following him slowly , and looking down at him , was a uniformed state trooper . He said soothingly , " Okay now , sir , okay . Everything 's going to be okay . Just try to stand on your feet . That 's the boy now ! " " Do n't tell me what to do ! " the man on the ground cried belligerently . I was nearer now , and when he turned his head I at once recognized the thin foxy face : it was Walshie . I do n't think he saw me , and it would have made no difference if he had : clearly the party with its abundant free drink had been too much for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto his knees and said to the trooper with surprising distinctness , " By God , if you want to hold on to that badge , buddy , just you do n't tell me what to do ! " And then he collapsed on the ground and lay there on his back , one hand raised and making a small and threatening fist , his facep214tilted to the stars . The trooper saw me ; he shrugged and smiled . " Par for the course , " he said . To Walshie he said , " Come on now . On your feet , sir . " From his back Walshie howled , " One more word outa you and you 'll be back pounding a beat where you belong . I 'm a personal friend of Governor Charles Kinsella ! You just ask the Governor if he do n't know Leo J. Walsh ! " " Okay , Mr. Walsh , " the trooper said patiently . He bent forward , reaching down as if to put a supporting arm under Walshie , but suddenly Walshie sat bolt upright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember that name if you know what 's good for you , buddy . I 'm a man that 's got a million personalfriends ! Governor Charles Kinsella ! Rudy Vallee the VagabondLover ! And more ! And I got up off my ass to lick cancer of the bowels and I can get up off my ass to lick you ! " And then , as sometimes happens with drunks , lucidity deserted him and so did consciousness : abruptly he collapsed once more , this time falling face down on the ground , where he lay absolutely motionless . Walshie had passed out . The state trooper , who had been bending forward all this time , now merely reached down and picked him up easily , as if he had been a pillow ; he said to me casually , " Out like a light . It 's funny , it 's always a poor little bag of bones like this that tells you he 's going to murder you . " I said , " Want any help ? " He shook his head . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . We 're all set up for this in there . We 'll sober him up some and then we 'll see he gets home all right . Do n't worry , sir . " He freed one of his arms long enough to give me a quick salute , and then he walked off toward the rear of the house , cradling little Walshie in his arms . And this was the last thing I saw at Charles 's victory party ; in a sense , perhaps , it was not inappropriate : I had begun the evening with Edso and Walshie , and now I had closed it with one of them . I drove home slowly , of course thinking of nothing but thisp215strange celebration which had turned out to be so different from what I had expected . The night had been full of the usual bounce and euphoria and laughter and noisy self-congratulation common to all such nights , but it had also been full of queer undercurrents and surprises , none of which I had anticipated , and none of which I found reassuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found this out shortly after I got home . I lived , now , in the house in which I had always lived  --  the house where I had been born , and where I had had my extraordinarilyhappy childhood with my mother and father and Tom and Ellen and Arthur . My father , who in his later years almost certainly could have used extra money , had persistently refused to sell the house , but after his death the question naturally came up again . Jean , who was besides myself the one most intimatelyinvolved , had not seemed to care much one way or the other , and it had been my Uncle Jimmy , that sentimental family man who was also a practical man , who had advised immediate sale . " It 's an ark : why hang on to a place you could raise buffalo in ? Who lives like that any more ? " " You do . " " Cut it out , " he had said , briefly  --  and correctly  --  indicating the difference in our circumstances . " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The taxes alone will put you in the booby hatch in ten years . Right ? Wise up . Sell it to the developers : you 'll never get a better price than right now . All those halfwits with that loose dough falling out of their pockets . Sell , get yourself a nice piece of change , pick yourself up an apartment . Down on the waterfront , the new ones . What 's wrong with that , hah ? There 's just the two of you : why stick around here ? " " Because this is where I want to stick around . This is where I want to live . " " Bushwa ! " he had exploded , but then he had let it drop and pushed it no farther . Instead he had said only , " You 're just likep216your old man . They 'll be running tag days for you before they 're through ! " But so far , at least , he had been a poor prophet . I had been able to swing it  --  not easily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed enormously important to me that it be done , that I hold on tight to this house which was the only place , really , that I had ever thought of as my home , so that no matter where I traveledor how often I went away I never felt that I totally belonged anywhere but right here : in this city , this house , this specific settingwhich had been so familiar to me for so long . Except that of course it was not quite so familiar now : changes had been made and some of them were great changes . The open land which had stretched out from our house on all sides was open no longer : ranch houses blanketed the former fields , and not far away the noise of the new divided highway could be heard . Our own land remained intact , but to the rear of the house the barn , or garage  --  or , for a brief period , the hangar  --  had long ago been torn down , and there was , in its place , a great square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house itself I kept in decent repair , but it was hardly the spick-and-span and shining white house of my childhood , and Arthur , who was still alive  --  Ellen had died twenty years before  --  and who , at the age of eighty-four , came over once a week from the rest home where he now lived to putter around and to lend a not-quite-steady but unref usable hand to small maintenance , mourned its appearance , thought of better days , and regularly commiserated with me . " It 'll be better , Mister Jack , " he said , " when your dad gets back and takes things over , the way he used to . There 's no one can get things going like your dad ! " For most of his moments this white-haired , good old man  --  as red-faced as ever , and still astonishingly unlined  --  lived in a world where my father was always about to return . In the beginning I had tried to tell him the truth , but this was no kindness : it bothered him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so in the end I let well enough alone and he was happy in his dreams of the old splendor which was soon to come again . And the changes had reached inside the house as well : here there was a great mixture of old and new , a strange blending of objects which seemed to date from five minutes ago with those which were as familiar as my bones . When Jean and I had moved in after my father 's death , she had been anxious to begin renovationat once . Naturally enough : it was now her house , and certainlyI had no plan to treat it as a kind of museum of childhood memories , to foolishly try to preserve something which in any case could never be preserved . So the house had been cleaned , rearranged , and in large part refurnished , with some of the best and the oldest and the well-remembered pieces kept , and others stored , sold , or discarded . Automatically , the house became smaller . We closed off the top floor entirely ; two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were in fact never used : it was a childless house , and the help we had  --  two cleaning women , each of whom worked part-time  --  came in the morning , left at night , and had no need for accommodation . There were other rooms which had been transformed in their purpose : the long bedroom where Tom and I had slept now becamemy study  --  a silent , pleasant , sunny room where I could write undisturbed whenever I was at home . The big rooms , the main rooms  --  the dining room , the library , the music room  --  were the least altered , or so it seemed to me . Many changes had been made here too , but curiously , even though surrounded by chairs and mirrors and tables and lamps which had been here for no more than a few years , I often felt that something about the rooms themselves seemed to come through , and to come through so strongly that it would seem to me that everything that was now here had always been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was especially true of the big master bedroom which had been my father 's and mother 's room , which had becomep220some particulars on both , and she said reflectively , " Well , I hope they enjoyed themselves . Because that 's the last time most of them will see the inside of that house , would n't you think ? " It was true , certainly  --  at least until another election . She said , " Tell me about Marie : how did she look ? Marvelous ? " Marie , on the other hand , was a great favorite ; they had hit it off from the first . I agreed that she had looked marvelous . " What was she wearing ? Well , no , you would n't be any good on that , would you ? But I 'll bet she was all in white . " " She was : good guess . " " No guess at all . White 's her color ; nobody looks better ... . You know she 's going to have a baby ? In April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I was even a little annoyed that she did  --  it was almost as if , having gone away , she had no right to know . I said , " Are you sure ? " " Yes , she told me . Well , she wrote : I have n't really seen her since this summer . In Paris . " Then she said , " It was funny : I saw a lot of the family there in just a couple of days , but you probably know that . I saw James the day after I saw Marie . He was very nice and gave me lunch . He spent a long time talking to me ; I seem to be one of his special targets , although I 'm not really sure I qualify . Having been baptized and confirmed and everything . Also , one night I saw Uncle Jimmy . He did n't see me  --  at least he did n't seem to see me , but I think he did , all right . I think he cut me . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never happened to me before . " She was silent ; so was I. It was a new note for these talks ; it was as though she had struck it in spite of herself , expressing not self-pity but a little surprise at what had happened . Surprise , and a slight hurt . And suddenly I found myself getting angry at my Uncle jimmy for what he had done , but then I realized , of course , that this was an absurdity , because I did n't know just what it was that he had done . I knew none of the circumstances : whether he had really seen her , and if he had , whether she had been alonep221at the time , or whom she had been with . My Uncle Jimmy was not ordinarily a delicate man , but he might not have behaved tactlessly here . I continued to say nothing . The silence lengthened , stretching out until I began to feel , very strongly , what I had not felt before : that something had happened that made this talk different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the awkwardness , the embarrassment , was not all mine , and as this gap , this emptinessbetween our words grew , I became suddenly apprehensive , and all at once I knew that the time had come : that at last , after all the months , something was about to happen . And then Jean broke the silence . She said , in a voice which was not the voice she had earlier used , " Jack , I want to say something to you . " And then I knew it was coming , and I knew what was coming . It was what I hoped with all my heart would not come , ever , and now I felt as if everything inside me had crushed together into a small , dry , airless ball that kept getting smaller and smaller and more withered with each breath I took . Suddenly , all over , I hurt , and I wanted to shout out , " No ! " Do n't ! " But I did n't because  --  because I could n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . I could only sit , curiously hunched forward as if this would in some way protect me , on the edge of the bed , squeezing the telephone in my hand , and waiting for the words I wanted so desperately not to hear . Jean said , " I ... " Then she started again and said , " I think . . . " And to know that she was finding it difficult to say what she had to say did n't help  --  it did n't help at all . She tried again , and this time , finally , she said it , and when she did I felt .. I felt , simply , what I had never felt before in all my life , and what I never , never , never will feel again . Because , speaking quickly , in a voice which was much lower than usual but which was quite distinct , quite clear , she said , " I think  --  if you 'd like to have me , that is  --  I think I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I heard her . I mean , really heard her , or remotely took in what she was saying , because it was so far from everything I had been so sure was coming , so far from what the long dull months of separation had increasingly prepared me for , so far from the appalling , numbing finality of someone you love with all your heart telling you that the part of your life which has been so totally hers is now at last all gone  --  it was so far from all this , I say , that in that first split second there was only a dazed blankness , a stunned suspension of the senses . Then , carefully , slowly , the words came in , one by one , and I reached for them cautiously , like a child who sees bright toys before him and ca n't yet believe they 're truly his . And then at last , suddenly and blindinglyit all came together and came bursting through , blasting me , smothering me with a great wild spreading joy , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the telephone , " Come now , Jean ! Come quickly , as fast as you can ! " Instead I must have taken too long a time , for before I spoke she said again , this time I thought a little anxiously , " Jack ? " And I said , all too palely , all too flatly , holding myself in becauseat this point I did n't trust myself to say any more , " Come on home , Jean . I 'd like you to . I want you to . " And then I added , " Very much . " I thought I heard a slight gasp , although I was n't sure ; she said , " All right . I 'll be there . " I said , " How soon ? When ? " " Oh , " she said , " I can come about any time . " I said , " Tomorrow ? " There may have been the faintest hesitation at this ; maybe not . I do n't know : at this point I was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " Tomorrow , yes . If that 's all right with you . " " I 'll meet you at the airport . " " No , I 'll come to the house . " She stopped , and then said , " IALL IN THE FAMILY 223guess I 've got lots of things to tell you , Jack . Not now , though . " " No , not now . When you 're home . " " It may take me a little time even then . " With a little embarrassedlaugh she said , " I 'm not too experienced at this sort of thing . As you know . " But I did n't answer this ; I just said , " Come home , Jean . " " All right . " Then she said , " Well ... tomorrow , then . Good night , Jack . " " Good night . Good night , Jean . " And before I heard the click in my ear I thought I heard her whisper something else to me , but again , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to bed . I did n't sleep . I lay there wide awake , all through the blue-black star-struck night , thinking only of Jean and Jean and me . And of Charles and Phil and my Uncle Jimmy and Marie and all the rest , who up until the telephone call had filled my mind and memory , and whose world had once more seemed so interwoven with my own , I now thought not at all.  |p227ABOUT  three weeks before Christmas , we went down to Georgiato visit Phil and Flossie . It was a good time of the yearto go , it was convenient for Phil , who was relaxing before all the business of the inauguration , but more than this it was the time to celebrate Flossie 's birthday . There was no more appropriateplace in which to celebrate this day , for this Georgia house had been Phil 's birthday gift to her , ten years ago . Jean and I had been at that birthday party too , and I can still remember Flossie 's lovely face as it changed from disbelief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage to Phil she still felt some alarm over the fact that money should be used in such delightful ways . Unlike Marie  --  who , although not obsessed by money , was certainly pleased by it and frankly rejoiced in all the good things it could buy  --  Flossie had not been a poor girl . Her family had had money for generations , but they had been " careful " for generations , too ; they had the traditional Yankee distrust of expenditure for ease and comfort and the strong belief that most of the abrasions encountered in life were not only necessary , they were also desirable . " It all goes back to Big Daddy Calvin , " Phil had said to me , when one day we had been talking about his in-laws . " They do n't know it , but it does . Ooop oop oop : watch it ! Do n't have toop228much fun ! You can see it in everything they do  --  even the way they eat . You ever notice that , by the way ? You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They put everything on their plates very tidily : meat , boiled potatoes , stewed tomatoes . Not too much of anything , and maybe instead of the meat there 'll be a small portion of fish with some sort of awful white sauce dumped all over it . Then do you know what they do ? They mix it all up . Before they put a fork to their mouths they mash everything all together on their plates . One big central ungodly mess , just so nothing will look too good or taste too good . Then they eat . Yum yum . Well , Flossie went through all this but somehow she escaped . She got it all but she really did n't buy it , and all I can say is thank God for that ! " And it was true : conditioned by it , she nevertheless had not bought it . In her mild way she hated all the harsher aspects of life which she had always been assured were good for her health and even better for her soul . She loved comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our climate she had found herself at odds with her elders , disliking our long and severe winters and often rather wistfully complaining about them . Sometimes jean used to talk about her in terms of the weather . " She 's a summertime girl , our Flossie . That 's what she adores : soft breezes and plenty of sunshine and tennis and all the kids beside her on the beach . It 's too bad hammocks went out of style : would n't she be perfect in one ? And when you think , when you just think of all the years she spent with those frozen-faced relativesat Crabapple Acres , it nearly breaks your heart ! " I had said , " You sound like Phil . " " That 's not bad , is it ? " she had answered . " After all , who knows Flossie better ? " And certainly she was a summertime girl . This was her season : she mourned its late arrival and its early passing , and now , with his astonishing birthday gift , Phil had extended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now and for all the years top229come . Watching her face at this birthday party ten years ago , I could almost see the last of the old " not-quite-right " spirit strugglingweakly , gaspingly , losingly against the all-too-evidently Wonderful . And in its way the house was wonderful : I thought so more than ever when Jean and I went down this year . It was located on the Georgia shore , not far from Sea Island : an old , spacious , and rather sprawling house , not remarkably designed , not particularlyhandsome . It was simply the most comfortable house I have ever been in in my life . The country around it was as purely agreeable as anything I could have imagined : soft and green and gentle , with pine woods beginning a bit inland from the ocean and rising slowly into a series of low hills . The smell of the sea  --  somehow different here than in the north  --  was always in the air , and even when the full complement of children were on hand it was quite possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or walking or swimming or sunning  --  and never once be disturbed . Flossie ran the house well , she had good help , the food was excellent . Everything seemed to move smoothly and without effort : it was of course an effect that can only be achieved with the help of a great deal of money . And yet , while this was a rich man 's house , perhaps the greatest merit of it was that while you were there , you never thought of it as being that at all . Phil and Flossie made the trip often , never in the summer months  --  when , Phil said , it was pure hell on wheels because of the heat  --  but in the fall and winter and early spring they frequentlyflew down , sometimes staying for weeks , sometimes only for as little as two or three days . The children loved it as these flying visits to their Southern home gradually became a part of their lives  --  their necessary removal from school for some of these visits seemed to worry no one ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I remembered that Phil , as well as his brothers , had not attended any regular school until well past the usual age  --   |p230and  Flossie , for her part , could have wished for nothing better . But as time went on , it seemed to me that Phil 's feelings had begun to shift , and now , although he appeared to enjoy the house itself and the surrounding country as much as ever , his pleasure in his neighbors  --  as well as a certain amusement at their manners , their general behavior  --  obviously had lessened , and his view of them had become increasingly sardonic . " All this pecan-pie charm loses a lot in the translation , " he said to me on this last visit . " Sooner or later you catch on to the fact that what you 're really listening to is the voice of the swamp . Nine out of ten of them are still right up there with the Stars and Bars , and when they talk about the Enemy they do n't mean Mao ; they mean the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you still meet two or three of the old Cunnel BeauregardV . Culpepper buffs , but mostly they 're younger : about our age . The new-style honeysuckle gasbags . They all talk in a smooth and civilized way about the orderly processes and about their very genuine fear ' that the time-honored protection of States ' Rights is going down the drain , but every so often something breaks through and then you can see that what they 're really afraid of  --  and all they 're really talking about  --  is good old Black Sambo , seven feet tall , running naked and drooling through Dixieland , moaning , I 's gwine to git yo ' sistahl ' Well , you know , enough is enough . When I come down here now I stick pretty close to the house and I horse around with Flossie and the kids and I swim in the ocean and I talk to the people who come down to see us , and that 's that . I 've just about had it with the homegrownproduct ! " It was disenchantment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a marvelous time . We came for four or five days ; we stayed for eleven . They were long , easy , languorous days : a great smooth stretch of time in which we seemed to move gently through the soft and unresisting Southern air , sometimes active , more often idle , sometimes with Flossie and Phil , more often by ourselves ,  |p231None  of the children  --  all of whom would be here for Christmas  --  had as yet arrived , and the four of us met mainly at dinner every night , where we ate and sat and talked for hours , mostly about other days when we had first been married and had regularly gone out together , often with Marie and Charles . There was something about this house , this place , which seemed to keep us in the past , like old people reminiscing about their days of vigor and delight ; about recent events and developments  --  the campaign , Charles 's prospects as Governor , politics in general  --  we did not talk at all : although this , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general feeling that Phil , after his long and steady immersion in political talk , at least down here deserved a rest . There was a common if unspoken agreement that if anyone introduced the subject , it would have to be he . But he did n't , and so  --  neither did we . One day in particular was memorable , and for a reason that had no connection with either Flossie or Phil . It was the day on which , at last , Jean and I talked freely and completely to each other . This talk we had been on the point of having ever since her return . She had come to the house from the airport and she had come quickly : I knew that because , unexpectedly nervous now that the time was here , sure that something would go wrong , I had called  --  twice  --  to check on the plane ; I knew the exact time of its arrival . And , astonishingly , here she was , minutes before I had thought possible . Watching from the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and then , as soon as she was clear of the cab , I saw her turn and look down at her right leg in quick exasperation : a run ? I opened the door as she began to hurry up the front walk , and for just a moment I saw her before she saw me : small , stylish , pale gray suit so clear and simple it must have cost the moon  --  she had money of her own , her clothes were her own province  --  tiny deep blue hat , small dark rich-mouthed face , looking as beautiful as ever and as if she had never been away.  |p232She  was almost running , and then she saw me looking at her and one small elegant foot stopped for the barest fraction of an instant , uncertain in midair ; then she came forward again , running now , and at the door she was in my arms . We said something to each other  --  what , I do n't know : I do n't think either one of us paid attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came together eagerly after the long months of apartness and deprivation , and for a time  --  an hour , maybe more  --  it was as though nothing bad had ever happened to either of us , as if the weeks and months just past were a mercifully annihilated dream . Eventually , however , she pushed herself up , and I saw the doubt and anxiety come into her eyes ; she suddenly said , " Jack , I  --  " and then just as suddenly she broke off and continued with words which we both knew had nothing to do with what she had been about to say . At exactly that point we remembered and knew that everything was not as it once had been , and that it had no hope of being so until what had to be said between us was . . . well , was said , and we could begin to face it and each other and make what had certainly once been there come alive again . So then , she would have to tell me : I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would do it soon , very soon , because as long as I had known her she had always faced her problems immediately and courageously ; she did not like procrastination . But now a curious process of postponement set in . Often I saw her ready herself and even actually begin  --  by now I could recognize all preliminary signs  --  but she never finished or really got into her story , and I never pushed or pressed her . I thought it best to let her take her own time , to make her own occasion , althoughto be really truthful there was something else at work as well : this was n't the purely generous act it seemed to be . The fact is that I willingly collaborated in each postponement , because in a way I was as reluctant to listen as she was to speak : I knew that whatever she told me , it would mean not only pain for both of us , but humiliation for me as well  --  and no man hurries to that . Wep233waited , then : a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one all-important subject we kept our silence . We went to Georgia ; the silence continued . And while it did we lived very pleasantly , laughing a lot and never quarreling , remembering all the better parts of all the earlier days , being  --  in a sense  --  happy . Certainly I was far happier than at any time since she had left , and I think  --  I know  --  she was happy , too . But it was in the end an unsatisfactory happiness , a happiness without depth , it was n't a married happiness : we were like two people playing house , doing all the things that real-life married people do , except of course the one important thing : we did not share each other fully , we did not shake each other with our lives . We were living agreeably in a kind of truce , together but apart , never quite unaware that beneath the smooth and placid surface ran a thin uneasy current . This all came to an end on that one day in Georgia . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy day we had . The morning had been fine , like all the other mornings we had seen down here : clear blue and gold , with a gentle steady onshore breeze , and a handful of small and very white clouds , no bigger than puffballs , scattered out across the length of the ocean horizon . It promised to be the best day yet , and as a bonus over the radio came that news which always warms the heart of the wintertime vacationer in the South : there had been a snowstorm up north , a blizzard , the first of the season . We congratulated ourselves and all drank a toast to absent and snowbound friends ; then , shortly after lunch , Phil and Flossie rode off on their horses , to be gone for the rest of the day . An hour after they had left the rain started . It came down with a sudden tearing violence , streaking in from the sea through the pines and across the lawn , the wind sweeping it along so powerfully that it seemed to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For perhaps twenty minutes this furious storm slashed against the house : there was no thunder , no lightning , but the noise of the battering rain itself was so loud that we had to shout to each other to be heard . Then it was over . Asp234quickly as it had struck the storm settled down into a soft and decorous rain , becomingly seeping from light gray skies onto the soaked green hills . We were alone in the house : the cook and the maid had left as soon as the heavy rain had stopped , going out to their own small cottage in the rear ; we saw them plodding off across the sodden lawn , barefooted and side by side , their shoes tucked under their arms . For a while we sat in the long living room , watching the rain , and talking about Phil and Flossie , wondering if they had been caught in the storm , wondering what we could do that might help . Nothing ; we did n't even know the direction they had ridden off in , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country well , and Phil was extremely resourceful ; we agreed there was no reason to worry . Jean , in bright canary slacks , suddenly plumped down on the floor , kicking off her sandals , stretching out on her stomach before the fireplace . During the storm we had lit the fire , more for cheer than for warmth ; it was welcome now on the softly gloomy afternoon , and as she faced directly into this fire I sat on the side , just watching her face : it was alert and mobile , always changing , and yet there were times , such as now , in this light , when it seemed to rest , to brood , when it seemed to have about it a queer kind of dark , deep , almost gypsy beauty  --  although this was a reflection which would have killed her father had he been alive to be killed . He had been an irascible ignoramus who had made a fortune in junk ; he had been married to an extremely handsome woman  --  more intelligent , equally irascible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own ; before his death this had come to be her one remaining merit in his eyes . Out of their turbulent , quarrelsome , parochial union had come Jean : the only child , convent-trained , willful , as vaguely unsatisfactory to both of them as they were precisely unsatisfactory to her . " Growing up , " she had said to me , shortly before our marriage , " I heard only two sounds in our house : screams and prayers . I got a little tired of both . "  |p235Her  own voice was soft ; she never screamed . In the observance of her religious duties she was quite likely to be casual . Now she said , still looking into the fire , " This is a great fireplace : do you know it 's the first fire we 've had in it since we 've been down ? How 's that for a crying shame ? " " It 's been too warm , even at night . I might speak to Phil : maybe he could put in air-conditioning to give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in Havana , remember ? In that nightclubthe Detroit thug owned ? At midnight the temperature outside was an even seventy-five ; inside on the dance floor you could freeze to death . They did it so all the Cuban ladies could show off their furs . Made weather : that extra little touch that marks the truly superb host . What do you think : could we get Phil to spring for something like that ? " She smiled , but did n't answer ; she kept looking into the fire , and for a little while neither one of us said anything . Outside , the rain was still falling at the same easy pace . I was getting drowsy ; normally I ate very little at noon , but today , because we had all been together for lunch and it had been more of an occasion , I had eaten heavily , and I was on the point of falling asleep in my chair when I heard Jean say , in the same tone she had been using , as if she were still talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I must have rehearsed this a hundred times , and now what good does it do me ? " And suddenly I was no longer near sleep ; I knew from the first word what was about to happen . She said , " I knew I 'd tell everything to you some day , and I thought it would help  --  help me , I guess I mean  --  if I knew exactly what to say , step by step , and then when the time came I 'd say it in such a way that you could n't help seeing that whatever I did I might have had a little something  --  not much , but just a little  --  on my side , and anyway I 'd say it as fast as I could , and then it would at least all be over . Except of course for what you 'd say to me , and I could n't very well rehearse that part of it , could I ? But it did n't do any good ,  |p236because  I 'm not going to say it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been lying here trying to remember just how I 'd decided to do it , but I ca n't . So my fine plan 's all gone : that 's fairly silly , is n't it ? " All through this she had remained looking steadily at the fire , but now she turned and looked at me , and there was in her eyes an expression of . . . what ? I do n't know ; something I could n't read . I said , " It does n't make any difference , does it ? You 've never had to work from a blueprint with me before : why start now ? I 've got one question , that 's all . If you want to answer it , okay . If you do n't , okay too . I just  --  " " I know , " she said , breaking in quickly . " I know I know : why ? And why Tony White , of all people ? That 's it , is n't it ? " I nodded . Because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me after all these months . I still had no clue at all : none for her leaving , and certainly none for Tony White ... . She looked at me and then took a long breath , swallowing air like someone about to go down underwater . Then , quickly , she exhaled , she was ready to talk , and it seemed to me there was a touch of sadness , even of pain , in her face . She said simply , " Becausehe bowled me over , Jack . It wo n't make any sense to you , I know . It does n't even to me now . But he did . He knocked me right off my feet . " And looking back on it now I do n't know what I had expected her to say  --  but not this . I just stared at her , stupefied , disbelieving ; she said , " You see , it 's no good : I told you it would n't make sense . You ca n't believe it : you 're looking at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'd just seen a herd of buffalo in the back yard . But it 's true , Jack . I 'm not proud of it , but it is ! " Suddenly , for the first time since she had started talking , for the first time since she had come back , I got angry , really angry , for I had known Tony White very well for a very long time . I pushed back , as if I were trying to get away from her ; I said sharply , " I do n't believe it , not for a minute ! Tony White , for God 's sake ! You , bowled over by that ! "  | " By that , " she said , unhappily but calmly . " By cheap little Tony White . The kind of man you make jokes about , do n't you ? If you talk about him at all , that is . He 's a coward , he 's a dreadful liar , he 's a sponge , he 's lived off at least two women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up in some very shady deals here and there . Oh , I did n't know all that at the time , I picked most of it up  --  very quickly  --  along the way , but all the same I knew enough to keep clear of him . Only I did n't keep clear . Not this time . And now I 'm looking at you , Jack , and I know what you 're thinking , but it ca n't be that big a surprise , can it ? After all , I did go away with him : there had to be a reason . Did you think he kidnapped me ? Or hypnotized me ? So it must have been something , mustn'tit ? " She was talking rapidly now , but very quietly : it was no panicky waterfall of words . All the time she talked she looked straight at me , keeping her eyes steadily on mine , not as if she were watching for any reaction I might have , but more as if this deep and reaching regard were a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words themselves might not get through . And I listened : angry , but ba ; ; ed and badly confused . Because obviously what she was saying was true , everything about her told me that , and yet there was no reason . . . . I said , " Why ? Or no , not why : how ? Flow could it even be possible ? Can you tell me that ? " " All right , " she said , " I 'll tell you . And do you know what it 's going to sound like , jack ? What you 're going to think ? You 're going to think I 'm out to excuse everything , that I 'm trying to . . . what ? Cop a plea ? Well , I guess maybe I am , but whether I am or not it 's the only answer I know how to give . I fell for Tony White because for two weeks , while you were off on one of your trips , a man who was reasonably young and reasonably attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and complimented me in a way that I had n't been looked at or talked to or complimented since I was a pretty girl around town with a list of beaus . Do you know something , Jack : I 'd almost forgotten there were men who could actually talk top238women and say something more than How are you today ? ' or  --  Are you through with that part of the paper yet ? ' It 's silly , it 's foolish , it 's much worse than that , I know , but Jack , that 's the way it all began : Tony White paid attention to me . You see , you 're wrong if you think he 's just five feet nine of nothing . He is n't ; he 's even charming when he wants to be . At least he is to women . All right , he 's contemptible and all that , but contemptible people can have charm , they can have appeal , and they can be clever enough to know when to use it . And on whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men like Tony are very very good with lonely married ladies . " And I stared at her with a curious feeling of hallucination : it was as if I 'd never heard her talk before , as if this woman I had been married to for so many years had suddenly begun to be someoneI had n't known at all . I said , " Which means what , as far as you 're concerned ? I do n't get it : are you a lonely lady ? With me ? " " Yes I am , jack , " she said quietly . " Do n't you know that ? Or have n't you ever thought about it ? I do n't think you have . Well , you can think about it now if you want to . A little . " Her voice changed and she said , " You see , I know you love me , Jack . I 've always known that . I do n't know how I 've known because you really are n't very good at showing it , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're my husband and everybody would call you a good husband . You do n't cheat on me , you do n't get drunk on me , you do n't hit me and you do n't abuse me . But Jack , you neglect me . You do , you really do . I 've tried to tell you this before , but it 's hard : no girl wants to say over and over again  --  even to herself  --  that she 's being ignored . But I am ignored , Jack . I 'm loved , but I 'm ignored . And that 's not what I want , it 's not good enough , it just is n't ! " I said , " That 's not true .... " " It is true . Just because you do n't wake up in the morning and say to yourself , Today I 'm going to ignore my wife ! ' does n't mean you do n't do it . You do ; you 've been doing it for years . I don'tp239mean just the most obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? Lately ? I 'm a married woman , I have n't any children , and I 'm not blaming anybody for that : you , me . I do n't know . But anyway I have n't got them , I 'd like to have them , but I have n't . And that 's that . So what I had was you , and you had me . The trouble was that I seemed to have you part-time , and you had me in pretty much the same way you had your car or your books or some college buddy . I was an old pal , jack . You got used to having me around : I was as comfortable as an old shoe . You read about these people who 've been married so long and know each other so well that they know every moment what the other one is thinking and so they do n't need to talk at all  --  well , that 's not my idea of marriage ! I do n't want to be a buddy , I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to knit and to watch TV and look up at the clock at nine every night and think that pretty soon it 'll be time to hit the hay . And then one day you 'll look at me and I 'll look at you and we 'll both say , You know what 's happened ? We 've grown old ! ' And that can happen , jack . It 's easy , easier than you think . Time goes by so fast and the next thing you know , that 's it , you 've had it , everything'sdone , finished , all over ! " I said , " More excitement ? More bubbles ? More kicks ? Is that what you wanted ? " " No , " she said . " All I wanted was you . But I could n't have you , because half the time you were a married man living by yourself . In a way you 've always been a married bachelor : sometimes I 've thought you lived exactly the way you would have lived if I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes most of your time . We live in your house , the house which is all yours  --  do n't think , by the way , that because the furniture and a few touches here and there are my idea that it 's now my house as well : I know the way you think of it , I can see that all the time . You 're still thinking of the boyhood here with Tom and Ellen and Arthur and everybody and that 's fine , that 's great , except  --  well , now I'mp240here , too ! You 've told me all about your mother and father and I loved your father , I think he was marvelous right up to the end . But maybe you ought to remember , just once in a while , the way he lived with your mother and the way he talked to her and behaved with her and spent his time with her  --  I know all that because you 've told me . I 've often wondered why a little of that did n't stick . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with him . Of course I know one reason why he did and I know that does n't apply to me , but after all it was n't the only reason , was it ? I always had the idea that they went off together partly because they loved each other and wanted to be with each other and so . . . and so there they were . But you , Jack , if you go off on a trip to get material for a book or to do a magazine piece , I do n't go with you any more  --  or not often  --  and to tell you the truth I do n't know how that happened . It just happened , it just somehow seemed easier that way , it seemed that you could work better and do whatever you had to do without me around and so I stopped going . And then I stayed at home and every other night or so you 'd call and say How 's everything ? ' and I 'd say that it was fine . And then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the next phone call or until you got home . Meanwhile I 'd go out with my girlfriends ' or have them in  --  although not too often , because they 're married , you know , and they have their own homes and their husbands  --  and we 'd gossip and talk girl talk , and when I was n't doing that and even when I was I 'd be waiting for you . Until this last time when , suddenly , I just did n't wait any more . I do n't know why , I just did n't . I could n't seem to help myself . All of a sudden I pulled up stakes and got out . One day , without even planning to do it , almost without even thinking about it , I said , All right , I will . ' And I did . And that 's how I left you , Jack . " For the first time now she stopped  --  though only to get her breath , I think , not to invite any comment or sign of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , because I could n't have given her one : right then I could n't have given herp241anything . I sat staring down at her  --  for she was still on the floor in front of the fire , but sitting now , steadied by one hand on the rug , her knees pulled up before her , and her eyes still watching me with the same unchanging expression  --  and I sat blank and frozenfacedand speechless , as if I 'd been paralyzed by very hard and unexpected blows . She said , " I ran away . I ran away with Tony White and that was insult to injury , was n't it , because I do n't know a living soul who really likes Tony  --  even I do n't any more . But I went off with him , I hurt you , I might have made a kind of fool of you  --  although that I never intended , I never thought about that at all  --  and I made , maybe not a fool , but something else of myself . 1 went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what they cost these days . In fact he got quite a bargain ; I did n't cost that much . I even paid for my own plane fare : Tony is n't really much of a spender . But I went . I went at five o'clock in the afternoon on BOAC , first stop London ; I went with one suitcase , a hatbox , and Tony by my side  --  he kept looking around for detectives . Detectives ! And it was a Saturday afternoon , it was April seventh , you were in Chicago , and I knew you would n't know a thing until Monday when you got home . I even had the good manners to leave a note , but I could n't think of what to say except , Do n't worry : am all right . ' And so far as I know that 's all you knew until I called from London and told you what I 'd done . I think I even asked you to forgive me . I hope I did n't , but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch that would have fit right in . I keep on saying cheap , ' do n't I ? For want of a better word , which I do n't happen to be able to find  --  although I 've looked hard enough , I can promise you that . Anyway , here you were and there I was . With Tony . For a time . For a very short time , as a matter of fact , but there I was and that 's what counts , is n't it ? And the next time you heard from me was two weeks later and the whole thing was over and I was alone in Edinburgh , of all places . But you did n't know that  --  about it being over , I mean  --  and I did n't tell youp242because . . . well , how would you tell a thing like that ? Surprise surprise , Jack : guess what ? I 've had my fling and now I 've just kicked Tony out ' ? Besides , I did n't want to tell you . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just knew it was better to be alone . With what remained of my pride  --  not that that was much . But at the moment it was all I happened to have . " Vaguely I was aware that something in her story was beginning to shift , that the emphasis , the tone , had become slightly different , yet I did n't fully take this in because all I could think about was what she had just been saying before this . I do n't think , now , that I was angry at all ; I was stunned , bewildered , and memories had begun to rush in on me , one after another and then all together  --  memories which I had often had before , but which now seemed oddly unfamiliar and disturbing , as if they had been completely changed , and suddenly I felt shaken and queer and full of a deep and spreading pain . She said , almost dreamily , " Were you ever alone in Edinburgh , Jack ? On a weekend ? Of course you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in exactly my circumstances , would you ? But anyway . . . I 've had better times . And then after I left there , I did n't have any place special in mind , so I just traveled . To places I 'd been and places I had n't . Sometimes I looked up people we knew . They were glad to see me , I think . When they asked about you I always told them you were finishing some work , that you 'd be along in a week or two . Well , of course you never were , but by that time I 'd moved on so it never did any harm . And then I used to meet other people , lots of them : strangers , in trains , on planes , in hotels . The usual places . And the usual people . Some of them were even rather nice : you know , to pass the time with . Of course there were always others who wanted to do a little more than pass the time . I suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushover : would n't you think that was it ? Only it did n't turn out to be quite like that . I do n't know that it matters now but my adventure '  --  I think that'sp243the polite word for it , is n't it ?  --  was n't repeated . Ever . With Tony or anyone . I 'm not after a merit badge for that but . . . I just thought I 'd tell you . I was alone and I stayed alone . Unbelievable as it may seem . " And now it seemed to me that her eyes did change , just a little , as if at last she wanted some sort of response from me . But still I did n't say a word , and for the same reason  --  I could n't . Her eyes changed back again and she said , " You see , I thought you might say something . I do n't know what : something appropriate , I guess . Like Congratulations ! ' For being such a good girl . Of course if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I mean , as a kind of reward for exceptional chastity  --  " And suddenly and loudly I said , " Do n't ! " Because what she was saying  --  and the way she was saying it  --  finally came crashing through my own private numbness and confusion : it was as if some special narcotic had worn off in a split second , leaving me sharply and freshly aware of everything that was going on around me , and I realized all at once that it was herself she was talking about with this harshness , this contempt , and suddenly this seemed to me unbearable and the only thing that mattered at all . I reached out and grabbed her arms and yanked her over to me . She half slid , half fell across the rug against my knees , and I saw her look up at me , startled and uncertain and I think even afraid , and she said very quickly , " Jack , please ... " And somehow this was the worst of all and almost broke my heart , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even for the smallest flash of a thought , that I could hurt her . I pulled her close against me as I slipped down onto the floor beside her , and there on the floor I held her in my arms . I said again , but softly now , " Do n't . Do n't say any more . You do n't have to . You should n't . " She said , in a kind of wondering way , " Should n't I , Jack ? " " No . Not for me . Ever . " She gave a strange , quivering motion and put her head
