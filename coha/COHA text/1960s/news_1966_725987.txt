txt The United Nations is deciding whether to embark on ' a historic test of its ability to bring down a government through trade sanctions . But both the intended victim , Rhodesia 's Ian Smith , and the bulk of his African foes agree that the proposed " selective " boycott will not work . This skepticism began to settle into place again only hours after British Foreign Minister George Brown had delivered an effective , confident speech urging the selective-sanctions course . He told a packed Security Council ( with so many standees it would have been the envy of Broadway producer David Merrick ) that Britain would not even oppose an amendment to include oil in the boycott list . But he made it clear that this applied , only to an oil amendment " in acceptable terms " ? one that would not hit South Africa . Even before the 38-member African group met to discuss its reply to this guarded Brown offer , many Africans were saying it would not work . They maintain that no matter how strong and widespread . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous leak for both the passage of banned Rhodesian exports and the import of vital oil into Rhodesia . Zambia 's tall , usually soft spoken Foreign Minister , Simon Kapwepwe , excoriated Mr. Brown and the Wilson government Friday . He called it " double faced , " and said : " It is clear that the British proposals would not work . " He spoke scornfully of British aid to Zambia as " patronizing handouts of an exhibitionist nature . " And he rejected the proposed compromise settlement aiming at gradual increase in African votes that Mr. Wilson , , * Please . turn to Page 12 *Rhodesian sanctions viewed with skepticism // discussed with Mr. Smith before the latest breakdown in British-Rhodesian talks . This halting but impassioned speech by Mr. Kapwepwe appeared to set the tone for African resistance . The resolution Mr. Brown submitted to the Council listed the expected products that all member nations would be immediately obliged to cease buying or shipping from Rhodesia : asbestos , iron ore , chrome , pig iron , sugar , tobacco , copper , meat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Mr. Brown , a total boycott of these products would soon break the Rhodesian economy . The Foreign Minister 's figures were these : Last year 's voluntary sanctions , he said , cut Rhodesia 's export total from about ? 143 million ( $400 million ) in 1965 to a current annual rate of ? 80 million ( $224 million ) . He asserted that a further mandatory boycott of the listed Rhodesian exports would jeopardize a potential $235 million worth of sales abroad . It is clear that the credibility of the British Labor Government as well as the credibility of the UN in the enforcement field hangs on the accuracy of Mr. Brown 's and Prime Minister Harold Wilson 's judgment of the effect of sanctions . The Africans London would like to see joining as sponsors of the sanctions resolution are skeptical because Mr. Wilson over-calculated the effect of the voluntary sanctions begun last November . Some of them also feel the Wilson government is still looking back over its shoulder to see if Mr. Smith is not about to run after them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to dispel this African concern . He also threw out some bait intended to get Commonwealth Africans and Asians to back London on its version of partial sanctions . He renewed the September Wilson pledge that if they did so " we will not thereafter be prepared to submit to the British Parliament any settlement which involves independence before majority African rule . " This appeared to be a renewed offer to burn all bridges to Mr. Smith once London 's limited-sanctions plan goes into effect ? if it gets African Commonwealth backing . This puts the Commonwealth Africans on the spot . They are doubtful of the effect of choking off Rhodesian raw-materials exports . They are even more doubtful of the effect of an oil-import ban that does not plug the South African leak . But they want Mr. Wilson to burn that last bridge . However , many would rather face an unfavorable Security Council vote with a bold oil amendment rather than put their names . to the kind of partial oil ban Mr. Brown says he will not oppose . Beyond Mr. Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Africans ' instinctive rejection of that picture there is a large realm of brinkmanship that is hard to assess completely . Messrs . Wilson and Brown obviously count heavily on frightening Rhodesian commercial leaders into throwing in the towel . Mr. Smith just as obviously continues to hope that Britain 's Conservatives  --  his enemies two years ago ; now , in fickle political tradition , his friends  --  will yet force a change of course on Mr. Wilson . Perhaps most important of all , Mr. Wilson may hope that he and powerful Washington can play brinksman to the extent that South Africa will not substantially breach the export boycott . South African opportunity But there is small reason so far to believe that any of these ventures to the brink will pay off , most diplomats here feel . The Rhodesian commercial leaders have already been hardened by a year of voluntary boycott . South Africa gradually left off heeding that boycott once the spotlight on oil-running ships was dimmed by apathy . And Mr. Wilson appears to be willing to run the gantlet of Tory doomsaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by diplomatic poker-playing than at first expected : ? But even if it is , UN officials believe it is likely to be an unsatisfactory test of the mandatory-sanctions idea . These officials complain that one of the most persistent axioms voiced here is : " Sanctions have never worked . " ? The trouble is , says one diplomat , " They have never been fully tried , certainly not in the modern era . But if a carefully circumscribed list of sanctions now is tried on Rhodesia and does not succeed , you will never be able to down the idea that sanctions can never . work . " South Africa would love to perpetuate this idea . It provides a shield of skepticism that would protect the Vorster government from having anyone even try a boycott against it . That would prove useful if anyone suggested sanctions to wrest South West Africa from Pretoria 's control ? or to punish South Africa for breaking the sanctions on Rhodesia . " How do you like that ? By providing a leak in the wall around Rhodesia , South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work against herself . " This reasoning is based on the assumption that Britain does not dare confront South Africa and jeopardize relations with its fourth-largest trading partner . And the second assumption that although Washington might so dare it will not do so if in the process the alliance with Britain is hUrt .
