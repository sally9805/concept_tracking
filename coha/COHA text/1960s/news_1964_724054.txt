txt The first step in the merger of two agencies feuding over Harlem 's antipoverty project was taken last night . The 60-member board of directors of the combined HaryouAct project was formally constituted . The new board then approved its charter and set up a temporary steering committee that will direct its affairs until permanent officers are elected . The new board did not resolve the underlying dispute , which is over who the permanent officers will be . It did , however , create a legal entity to receive $1 million being held for it by the President 's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency . Of the seven-member steering committee , four were formerly members of the board of Associated Community Teams was one of the sponsors of the Act program . Dr. Kenneth B. Clark , a psychologist , is connected with Haryou . Each has accused the other of trying to take over the combined program . The chairman of the steering committee said after the closed meeting that the new board 's actions last night should qualify it for Federal funds . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the project 's problems . Earlier in the clay Sargent Shriver , the director of President Johnson 's antipoverty campaign , had warned that the Haryou-Act project would get no Federal funds until the wrangle over its control was resolved . In his second day of testimony before the House Labor subcommittee in Washington , Mr. Shriver said that the proposed $962 million anti-poverty bill could not be applied in " communities where there is a civil war over leadership . " Mayor Wagner also indicated impatience yesterday with the Harlem project . The Mayor called on two officials close to the Haryou-Act program to meet with him within " two or three days " to see what could be clone about getting the project started by its July 1 target date . The two ? Whitney Young , executive director of the National Urban League , and Henry Cohen , a deputy city administrator  --  have been mentioned informally as possible mediators in the dispute . Much of the dissension is centered on the choice of an executive director for the BaryonAct project . Mr. Powell favors a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported City Welfare Commissioner James R. Dumpson . In his statement yesterday Mayor Wagner sad it was " crucial for the youth and families of Harlem and for the people of the city of New York that this demonstration program be launched promptly and effectively . " Communiqu ? Released The first meeting of the new board last night was held at Act headquarters , 179 West 137th Street . The board met for an hour . At the end , the steering committee issued a terse communiqu ? that listed the night 's actions and the 60 members of the board . The chairman of the temporary steering committee is Allan Morrison , New York editor of Ebony magazine . He is on the Act board . The other members from Act are Jawn Sandifer , Andrew Tyler and Mr. Wingate . The Haryou members are Dr. Clark , Mrs. P. M. H. Savory and Dr. David W. Barry . Dr. Clark was elected temporary chairman of the board and Mr. Sandifer the temporary secretary . The board will meet next on June 29 at Haryou headquarters . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , will be requested . After this is done , the board will be ready to appoint a nominating committee to select permanent officers . It is at this point that the dispute over leadership will come to the surface . Of the 60 members of the board , which will actually elect the officers , 24 are from liaryou , 16 from Act and 20 are new appointees . The board members referred inquiries about last night 's meeting to Mr. Morrison . The steering committee chairman and the three other committee members from Act stayed around to answer questions from the Dress . The three Haryou members , including Dr. Clark , left shortly after the meeting ended and would answer no questions . Mr. Morrison acknowledged that differences of opinion had been expressed at the meeting and that differences on " policies , procedures and personalities " remained . But , he said , he had found a " great fund of goodwill " at the initial meeting . " We are on the road to settlement of our problems , " he declared . Mr. Shriver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. Javits had cited the Haryou-Act dispute and said there was a danger that a " most unseemly " spoils system might result from the Federal antipoverty program . The New York Republican suggested that the program might better be put under state control to lessen the danger of battles over the funds provided in the bill . Mr. Shriver greeted this with skepticism . He asked Mr. Javits if he thought that would eliminate politics from the program . Mr. Javits replied that at least state officials were " closer to the grass roots . " Mr. Shriver concluded that the best protection against politics in the bill was the requirement that the antipoverty director report to Congress each year before new money could be appropriated . Mr. Shriver also corrected Mr. Javits when the Senator called the Haryou-Act plan a " $110 million project . " " The entire community action program in the bill only calls for $300 million , " Mr. Shriver said . " Despite my fondness for New York , we 're certainly not going to give $110 million of the $300 million just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price tag Haryou-Act has put on its attempt to " defuse the social dynamite of Harlem " by working with its 71,000 youths . The funds are- expected to come from Federal , state , city and foundation grants . Very little money has as yet been apportioned .
