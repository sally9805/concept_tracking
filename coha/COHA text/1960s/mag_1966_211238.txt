Short of staying off the streets , cutting off the newspaper , unplugging the radio , boycotting TV and locking the mailbox , the only way a Pennsylvanian can ignore this fall 's cacophonous gubernatorial campaign is by clearing out of the state . In one of the nation 's most flamboyant and free-spending races , Democrat Milton J. Shapp , 53 , and Republican Lieutenant Governor Raymond P. Shafer , 49 , by the morning of Nov. 8 will have lavished at least $3,600,000 on the cashkrieg campaign for the governorship . <P> Though the G.O.P. plans to spend $1,600,000 of that sum , Millionaire Shapp has made Shafer look like Scrooge . In Philadelphia and Pittsburgh alone , the Democrat 's homely , intense visage peers out from 180 buses and 400 taxis . Along highways from the Alleghenies to the Poconos , 1,200 bright orange Shapp billboards vie with the autumn foliage ; 80 radio stations play his 30-and 60-second spots ( " If you liked William Penn , you 'll love Milton Shapp " ) . Local TV stations will carry at least 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 16-page brochure to 3,500,000 voters . <P> Beyond Frederick . Shapp , an engineer by training , parlayed a $500 investment into a fortune exceeding $10 million with a Philadelphia-based electronics firm that bears his middle name . Though he had long hankered to get into politics , the keepers of the Keystone State 's Democratic machine-not unlike the G.O.P. bosses in John O'Hara 's Ten North Frederick-wanted Milt 's money more than they wanted Milt . To many party leaders , Shapp seemed an egotistical buffoon . There was also the fact that he was born Milton Shapiro-and no Jew had ever run for Pennsylvania 's highest office . <P> The non-O'Hara sequel to the Frederick standoff was that Shapp decided to go it alone-with $1,400,000 of his own money . In May , he scored a triumphal 50,000-vote primary upset over the Democrats ' machine-backed candidate , and badly shook both parties . While the Republicans tried feverishly to anticipate Shapp 's strategy , Democratic bigwigs belatedly sought to win the parvenu 's allegiance . At a banquet in Harrisburg , ex-Governor David Lawrence , longtime Democratic kingmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish . I must admit I am eating mine . " Shapp thereupon served him another portion . After the dinner , he charged-with some reason-that Lawrence 's organization had " stalled " Democratic progress , and **28;1112;TOOLONG he be given control of the machine . <P> The Decibel Gap . By contrast with Maverick Shapp , Yale-trained Attorney Shafer is a dutiful , if undistinguished , party pro ; he served two terms as a state senator before running with William Scranton-who can not succeed himself-in 1962 . While Shapp is a wispy , almost Chaplinesque figure , Shafer , son of a Protestant minister , is a craggy-faced , sandy-haired , 6-ft. 2-in. ex-athlete who won nine letters at Allegheny College to go with his Phi Beta Kappa key . Lawyer Shafer is as taciturn as Tycoon Shapp is talkative . Shafer " comes on like Mount Rushmore , " as one Pennsylvanian puts it , " and is about as animated . "
