The 36 financiers , lawyers and Government officials gathered in the arch-ceilinged office of Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach fell suddenly silent . Ceremoniously , an aide sliced open an envelope and passed its contents to Katzenbach , who read aloud the figure on a slip : $29,476 . The audience buzzed with surprise , and one onlooker gasped : " Incredible ! Let them have it . " The figure , said the Justice Department 's key financial adviser , was " beyond their wildest dreams . " <P> <P> So last week , after 23 years of courtroom haggling , foreign intrigue and Wall Street speculation , the U.S. Government finally unloaded General Aniline &; Film Corp. , the giant industrial combine that it had confiscated in 1942 on grounds that the Swiss owners were fronting for I.G. Farben , the German chemical cartel . At $29,476 a share for 11.2 million shares , the Aniline stock offering brought in $329,141,926.49 . It was the largest competitive stock offering in history , ranking second in size among all offerings only to the Ford stock sale in 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were completely snapped up by investors , who drove the price up to $36 before it settled back to $32 at week 's end . <P> Behind Locked Doors . The winner in the competition for Aniline 's stock was a syndicate of 215 underwriters led by Manhattan 's Blyth &; Co. and First Boston Corp. ; the cry of " Incredible ! " had come from the representative of a competing syndicate of 350 companies headed by Lehman Brothers , Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. and two others . Blyth and First Boston bid $1.21 a share more than the competition , and Blyth 's board room back in New York broke into pandemonium when the word was flashed from Washington . The sixth largest U.S. underwriter and the biggest over-the-counter dealer , Blyth had formed the syndicate to bid for Aniline way back in 1945 , had kept its members together for two decades while the legal battle over Aniline went twice to the U.S. Supreme Court and once to the World Court . <P> How had the syndicate decided on its price ? As the sale date neared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its executives , visited its 14 plants . They also gauged the probable public demand for stock on the basis of the price of the 61% of stock already on the market and of the advance orders for the Government 's 93% . Finally , after each member had suggested a price , the syndicate members agreed on their bid behind locked doors less than an hour before the sale . That $329 million figure-33 times what Aniline earned per share in 1964 ( $10.7 million ) and 27 times the top forecast for its 1965 net-was high enough so that 25 firms withdrew from the syndicate . The risk was considerable : had the syndicate overestimated what the public would pay by only a little more than $1 a share , it stood to lose several hundred thousand dollars ( plus the $900,000 cost of the transaction ) instead of pocketing its $12.5 million underwriting fee .
