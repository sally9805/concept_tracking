Forms in motion demonstrate the depths of space , and dramatize it in myriad ways . For example , a galloping horse imparts one kind of life to the loop of a mile-long track , and a man making the same circuit in a wheelchair gives it quite another . Even a static sculptured figure can dramatize space somewhat , as by seeming to point or to run . But can sculpture ever convey the sense of rapid , elaborate motion through space that almost every child of the steel age daily experiences ? " Yes , " says Norbert Kricke of Duesseldorf , and his does . <P> Tubes for Speed . An unassuming man in most other ways , Kricke has pushed to the forefront of modern German sculpture . At 37 , he gets up to $25,000 each for his constructions , but still lives the life of a poor art student . Kricke occupies a spectacularly shabby studio in a kind of artists ' barracks in Duesseldorf , sleeping on the balcony with his wife . Their daughter , 11 , has a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is littered with contorted steel tubes , cutting , bending and welding equipment , and an acetylene torch with its hoses and tanks . <P> Kricke 's method is to sculpt with lines , which are his tubes . As he composes them , the tubes do not seem to outline shapes ; they remain lines , as in handwriting or neon . " Never , never , " Kricke vows , " will I use lines as a limiting element ! " The eye follows Kricke 's lines as if they were intertwining jets of water , now fast , now slow , and changing with each new viewpoint , or starting place . The effect on the viewer can be as exhilarating as that of negotiating a parkway cloverleaf at maximum speed , or of flashing through a night-blazing city in a darkened Pullman berth . <P> Factories for Atmosphere . The man behind these vibrant creations is surprisingly round , of belly , of face and of pale blue eye . Raised in Berlin , he entered the air force right after high school , but was grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been killed . As a student at Berlin 's Academy of Fine Arts after the war , he was a disciple of Rodin , but Kricke 's independence of mind soon asserted itself to make him unpopular with his academic teachers . He moved to Duesseldorf because ' ' it has a certain dynamism , factories going up every day , " and began the independent career that led him to decisively abstract sculpture . Kricke 's steel constructions have since made him an international figure , with works in German , French , Belgian , English and American museums . Four of his pieces stole the show at an exhibition of European sculptors at Manhattan 's Staempfli Gallery last week . <P> Kricke 's present passion is for water forms . He will collaborate with Architect Walter Gropius on fountain designs for the University of Baghdad . " A fountain , " says Kricke , " is often nothing but a Neptune ringed by spitting fish . The real thing should not be a mere mass from which water spurts . It is water , the passive element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent element , endowed with a voice . It is water , the shapeless element , endowed with a form of its own . "
