Convicted of assault with force during an attempted rape , Robert C. Jordan Jr . was sent to California 's Soledad prison in 1958 for an " indeterminate " sentence of six months to ten years-with a chance for early parole if he behaved . He did not . By last year , Jordan was a familiar tenant of Soledad 's Adjustment Center , in what the prison calls a " strip cell " for " incorrigibles . " <P> On his last visit to one of the totally bare cells , claimed Jordan , he was kept naked for almost eleven days , deprived of heat , light , bedding , ventilation , medical treatment and the most basic sanitary facilities . He appealed to San Francisco 's U.S. District Judge George B. Harris , who thereupon indignantly issued his circuit 's first federal injunction against state prison officials . Impressed with Jordan 's " clear and convincing " testimony , which vividly described cells caked with human excrement , Judge Harris saw a patent violation of the Eighth Amendment 's guarantee against " cruel and unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells in keeping with the " primal rules of a civilized community .
