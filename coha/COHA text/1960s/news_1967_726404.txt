The fines were levied against the Will County Federation of Teachers and its leaders by Judge Michael A. Orenic in Will county Circuit court . He ruled that the 12 union leaders are " guilty of willful contempt of court " for refusing to obey his Jan. 25 injunction that ordered the teachers back to classes .
