Pent-up resentments have erupted in violence , and many French Canadians now believe that Quebec must sever her ties with Canada , although that could spell economic disaster . W hen I left Quebec to live in the United States in the spring of 1959 , Maurice Duplessis was still alive . He was then the premier of a corrupt and backward Canadian province , twice the size of Texas , where idiots , convicts , and married women were legally prohibited from making contracts , where the dead voted several times in each election , where labor was plentiful , cheap , and intimidated , and an $18 government license to sell liquor might be had for a $30,000 bribe . For almost a quarter-century ( with a hiatus of one wartime defeat ) Maurice Duplessis , a bachelor , ruled five million people as if they were children . He was not an indulgent father . On one occasion he demanded that the Vatican remove Archbishop Joseph Charbonneau of Montreal , a liberal prelate who had dared to oppose him . Charbonneau was exiled to British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own attorney-general and trusted neither his ministers nor the members of his National Unionparty to run the government except under his direct supervision . On September 7 , 1959 , Maurice Duplessis died of a cerebral hemorrhage and Paul Sauve took over as Quebec 's premier . Sauvd was the one National Union minister whom Duplessis had never been able to browbeat , and he promised to reform the government . He had made an impressive start when in January 1960 he died of a heart attack . The National Union chose as his successor an old Duplessis henchman named Antonio Barrette . Quebec , however , repudiated Barrette at the polls , and in June 1960 the provincial Liberal party came to power for the first time since 1944 with the slogan 11 faut que ca change ? it has to change . It was in a sobering atmosphere of national disunity and provincial unrest that a forty-eightyear-old lawyer named Jean Lesage became the new Liberal premier of Quebec . The province has always been an indigestible lump in English Canada 's throat but at least French Canadians know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsure of their national identity . In a recent survey 29 per cent said they wanted to join the United States and 65 per cent said they favored economic union with the U. S. Canadians have had two minority governments in succession . They could not agree on an official 94 THE CASE FOR AN INDEPENDENT QUEBEC Canadian flag or a national anthem , so they solved the dilemma by having neither . On one point , though , English Canadians do agree : they consider French Canadians second-class citizens . In the summer of 1960 Quebec was underdeveloped territory . Its people were undereducated and underemployed . They were ready to try anything to transform their province into a modern , industrialized state . The main difficulty was how to pay for progress . Although direct taxation is a right granted the provinces by Canada 's constitution , the federal government was collecting most of the nation 's taxes and returning only a fraction of this money to the provinces . Quebec was broke . As Lesage prepared to challenge Ottawa 's fiscal authority , trouble flared at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quebec 's minority status as compared with the nine English-speaking provinces , demanded that Quebec secede from Canada and become an independent republic . They called themselves Separatists but no one took them seriously . French Canadians make up a third of Canada 's 18,500,000 population , and those living in Quebec believed that despite their difficulties with Ottawa , Quebec 's future belonged with the country which will celebrate its one-hundredth birthday in 1967 . But as the months passed , Separatists ceased to be regarded as harmless hotheads . Their slogans appeared on walls and fences : Vise Canada Francais ! Quebec Libre ! They wrote books , made speeches , formed Separatist parties , demonstrated . Dr. Marcel Chaput , one of their leaders , went on a hunger strike to raise money for the cause . In thirty-three days of fasting he raised $100,000 and lost forty-one pounds of his original 245 . Then , bombs exploded in Montreal . A man was killed ; another maimed . Arms were stolen from military supply depots . Young men joined an underground army called the Front de Liberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Queen Elizabeth II was warned by Separatists not to visit Quebec this October ? her safety could not be guaranteed . Premier Jean Lesage worked fast to get his Liberal program passed in the provincial legislature before the Separatists , trading on the people 's discontent , gained any more popular supJacqueline Moore was born in Montreal , Quebec , of mixed Irish and French parentage , was educated there , and worked for twelve years on local newspapers .

He raised the school-leaving age to fifteen , lowered the voting age to eighteen , nationalized private power companies , started free hospital insurance , devised a province-wide old-agepension plan , enlarged the rights of married women , eliminated corrupt election practices , and named the first Minister of Education in Quebec 's history . But the Separatists still remained , growing stronger , and what was once inconceivable is now considered possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee to study the effects of independence , and Lester Pearson , the Prime Minister of Canada , announced shortly afterwards that the federal government might do the same . An ugly , anti-French sentiment is growing in the English provinces . There is real danger of a civil war if Quebec tries to secede . No Opinions , Only Sentiments As the news from Canada grew more disturbing . I decided to return to see for myself what was happening in the province where I was born . I found a Quebec I scarcely recognized . The mood among English Canadians there is one of hostile uncertainty : It ca n't possibly happen here ? but it may . What do the French want , for God 's sake ? How much can we give them without destroying Canada ? An independent Quebec would cut us in half , like Pakistan . The United States wo n't let it happen ? the Americans would never let French Canadians control the St. Lawrence River . Arrogance , formerly an English Canadian trait , seems to have been transferred to the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children to French schools now ; but , conversely , many young French Canadians refuse to speak English anymore , though they speak it fluently . A French student tells me his design for a uniquely Canadian flag : " nine beavers urinating on a frog . " The new breed of French Canadian is proud-of his race . " We used to he anti-English , " one told me . " Now , we 're pro-French . " They no longer feel inferior to those English-speaking Canadians who have ruled their economic lives since they were conquered by the British in 1759 . " Last year 's bombs blasted more than mailboxes , " a young journalist explained . " They blasted English complacency . Five years ago we could n't get Ottawa to send out bilingual government checks . Now , everyone here is taking French lessons . But it 's too late . We no longer give a damn whether the Anglo-Saxons learn French . " One hope bolsters sagging English morale in Quebec : the hope that the " average French Canadian " will not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him money and lower his standard of living ? which has only recently begun to rise . No one knows for sure how the majority of French Canadians feel . Trade union leaders are solidly against Separatism , but when I pointed out this fact to a young Separatist he laughed . " They were solidly against Duplessis too . " he said . " And they tried to convince union members not to vote for him . But the workers ignored their leaders and voted National Union anyway because they admired Duplessis ' style . They will ignore their leaders again . " Sir Wilfred Laurier , the great French Canadian statesman , once said Quebec does " not have opinions , only sentiments . " It is precisely this emotional approach to their problems which makes it so difficult to predict how French Canadians will react , finally , to the issue of Separatism . Certainly the idea of independence has always appealed to them . ( " We are all Separatists at heart , " a Quebec politician has said . ) But no one can predict whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose independence as the ultimate solution of their minority status . Perhaps they only intend to use the threat of secession as a weapon to force changes in the Canadian constitution . Many of the people to whom I spoke , however , said they were willing to pay the economic price of independence . " We want to get out in the world on our own , " a Separatist told me . " We do n't exist now . What 's a French Canadian mean , say , to a Mexican ? We want to build something that resembles us , so that the world knows us . Independence is harder than being governed by others . We know that , but we 're grown-up , we 're willing to take on the burden . " The new self-confidence of French Canadians is expressed by a joke making the rounds in Quebec . A French Canadian is drowning in a provincial lake . " Help ! " he screams . Two other French Canadians hear the scream but do nothing . A second " Help ! " rings out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one French Canadian turns to the other . " Instead of learning English . " he says , " he 'd have done better to learn to swim . " One of the first persons I arranged to see when I went home was Gerard Pelletier , the forty-four-year-old editor-in-chief of La Presse , Montreal 's biggest French daily . Pelletier does not want Canada to break up . He does n't think an independent Quebec could survive as a small drop of French water in a vast American sea , and he is passionately attached to the idea of French Canadian survival . " The thing all French Canadians have in common , " he said , " is a desire to maintain our national identity . It is precisely because this identity is threatened that Separatism has become so attractive an alternative . It 's a symptom of our hidden discontent . Personally , I do n't believe it 's the answer to our problems . What 's more , so many Separatists seem to favor some form of totalitarian state , I would consider independence a disaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is opposed to the idea of a separate Quebec , Pelletier does not condone the treatment his people have received . Speaking of the English , he said : " They have had ninety-seven years since Confederation to make Canada a truly bilingual country and they have done nothing . The Separatists have scared them . Perhaps the threat of secession will force changes as nothing else has been able to do . " The idea that Confederation was a bad bargain for the French has led some people to throw out the baby with the bath water . I had an odd conversation with a French poet . " There is no Canada , " he told me . " It 's a myth . It does n't exist . " " Then what are you ? " I asked . " I 'm a Quebecer , " he said . " And what am I ? " I asked . " That 's your problem , " he replied . It might have been amusing to bring this young poet along on the day I went to tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English-speaking matrons around the tea table were accustomed to dealing with French Canadian maids , taxi-drivers , and postmen , and they discussed Quebec 's malaise as if they were planters ' wives in Kenya . They complained of uppity salesgirls who refused to serve them in English . They decided the French were impossible , that " something " should be done about them . One woman said she was not going to be able to fly her Union Jack on the lawn at her summer cottage . " They tore a lot of flags down last year and I do n't want any unpleasantness , " she said , " But I wo n't let on why I 'm not flying the flag . I 'll just say the halyard 's broken , or something . " She paused . " I ca n't understand it We 've never had any trouble with the Union Jack Burning the Laboratory by Robert Pack For months I have been planning it . The time has come , nothing having changed .

It is possible . Like peace . at the golf club , and we have several French Canadian caddies . " I myself am of mixed blood ? half French . half Irish ? and I find it difficult to control my anger when English Canadians discuss French Canadians in this way , or as priest-ridden , uneducated , inferior . dishonest ? which are among the more common epithets . It is true that when I lived there , Quebec politics seemed to bear out this harsh description . But Quebec 's character was forced on her by history . Abandoned by France and conquered by Britain , the original French settlers were allowed to keep their language , religion , and civil laws ; but they nevertheless found themselves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was they who had to learn English to get work , even though 82 per cent of the province of Quebec is French-speaking by birth . Only Quebec had both English and French public schools , and responsible jobs in Ottawa almost always went to English Canadians . The same discrimination was practiced in the business world , and a French Canadian was forced to adopt the manners and language of the English if he wished to get ahead . More than 50 per cent of Quebec 's manufacturing industry and 80 per cent of her mining industry are still controlled by non-French Canadians . As a result of such factors the French in Quebec developed their feelings of inferiority and their sense of persecution . They resisted progress because progress meant change ? and change would threaten their ethnic survival . They clung to the Roman Catholic Church as a defense against Protestant anglicization . Any demagogue who promised to protect their rights and who blamed Ottawa for their misery ? as Duplessis did ? could he certain of their allegiance . It is only since Duplessis ' death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in the list of things to be improved . Andre Laurendeau , a respected French Canadian journalist , has given an acid explanation of English Quebec 's bland indifference to the corruption in successive provincial governments . Laurendeau wrote that " Quebec 's Anglophones English-speakers behave like the British in one of their African colonies . They surround the Negro King but they let him behave as he pleases . Occasionally , he will be permitted to cut off heads if it 's customary . It would never occur to them to demand of a Negro King that he conform to the high moral and political standards of the British . The Negro King must collaborate and protect the interests of the British , With this taken care of , the rest counts for little . Does the little King violate the rules of democracy ? Well , what could one expect from such a primitive creature ? " Two Voices in the Church The Church is a powerful guardian of French Canadian culture and morals , but it , too , has been put on the defensive . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic thought , a French Canadian teacher , who was later identified as Brother Pierre JerOme , wrote a book called The Impertinences of Brother Anonymous in which he attacked Quebec 's backward , churchrun schools , the bad French spoken by her citizens ( the " language of defeat , " he called it ) , and the reactionary clerical domination of the province . " I work with the axe , " he wrote , " though I do n't like to . , . . We are a servile race ; our loins were broken two hundred years ago , and it shows . .. " Four months after the book 's appearance , it had sold more than 100,000 copies . Shortly afterwards , Brother Anonymous was required to go abroad " to continue his theological studies . " That was 1960 , when the Church still felt secure enough to discipline one of its members . But this year , I was told , Brother Anonymous is coming home . Paul-Emile Cardinal Leger of Montreal , Quebec 's senior churchman , is a liberal , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops are horrified at the erosion of their power , particularly in the field of education . This ecclesiastic split has made it difficult for the Church to speak with one voice and so she has chosen to remain officially silent as old values vanish from the province . When I lived there , many intellectuals were anticlerical because Quebec was a tightly controlled clerical state . But these men believed in their religion , even as they fought the Church 's temporal power . This is no longer true , especially among university students . " We 're not anticlerical anymore , " a young man told me . " We 're simply not religious . " With the Church 's authority weakening among students and intellectuals ; with the Separatists reaching for power , Quebec is nearing her time of decision . Premier Lesage , who once served as Minister for Northern Affairs in the federal government , is now asking the federal government to decentralize itself in order to stem the tide of Separatism . The Lesage plan ? which he calls cooperative federalism ? envisions a bicultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect and spend her own money , get out of as many joint federal-provincial plans as is feasible , and be consulted as an equal partner on matters of national policy . His position is somewhat similar to that of the extremist defenders of states ' rights in the United States , and to English Canadians he sometimes sounds like a Separatist ntanque . The current Lesage slogan is Maitres Chez Notts , which means Masters in Our Own House . But the man whom English Canadians fear the most is a forty-two-year-old political phenomenon named Rene Levesque who is Minister for Natural Resources in the Lesage government . Levesque 's power in the province goes far beyond the limits of his job and last spring an English-language magazine demanded his arrest for sedition because he told a student audience in Montreal that the use of guns and dynamite was immoral and that Quebec 's future status must be achieved without them " as much as possible . " It was the last four words which got him into difficulties with the English . Levesque is frank , sometimes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and has consistently opposed the use of arms . his left-of-center political philosophy which appeals strongly to young French Canadians is another mark against him in English Canada . And his insistence that one-third of the country can no longer be ruled by the other twothirds has made his name anathema in the other provinces . " Permanently Disgusted " The difference between the Lesage and Levesque positions is more one of degree than anything else . They both want a self-governing Quebec but Levesque goes further in the powers he would give the province . When I lunched with him in Montreal , he said he believed it might be possible to keep Quebec within Confederation ? so long as everyone realized the status quo was dead . If , however , Quebec could not achieve the freedom she wanted within the context of a federated Canada , then Levesque saw no choice for her but to get out . Until he went into politics , Levesque was a popular political commentator for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , a job which has made his face and personality as familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ardent nationalist when I first met him , fifteen years ago . What had changed him so ? " The CBC strike , " he told me . " It convinced me the French-English partnership in Canada was a myth . " That strike , which began in late December 1958 , involved seventy-four producers of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 's French network . They went out on strike for the right to join a union . The strike was long and bitter ; English-speaking producers and English unions did not support it . During the strike , Rene Levesque wrote an article in which he criticized the English press for their handling of strike news and said he did not believe Ottawa would have let the strike drag on so long if the English network had been involved . " Some of us , " he wrote , " maybe a lot of us , will come out of this permanently disgusted with a certain ideal called National Unity . " A year later , he went into politics and became the leading radical in Jean Lesage 's reformminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIN , the Rassemblement pour l'Independence Nationale . The RIN is the dominant party to emerge from among the half-dozen Separatist groups born in the early days of the movement . The party is led by men under forty , supported by men under forty , and dedicated to establishing the Republic of Quebec before Canada 's hundredth birthday in 1967 . The RIN is an unknown force since it has yet to be tested extensively at the polls , but the party plans to run candidates in the next provincial election which must come by 1966 . Andre d'Allemagne , the party 's first president , is a thirty-four-year-old advertising copywriter who wrote his master 's thesis on the ill effects of speaking two languages . When we talked , d'Allemagne told me he would like to see Quebec a republic modeled on Sweden 's welfare state . The RIN hopes , he said , to elect enough deputies to the next provincial legislature to constitute a majority in favor of independence . They would then vote Quebec out of Confederation . D'Allemagne is opposed to violence but he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not troubled by the problems independence would create and he feels sure Quebec could survive . " Look at all the nations that have won independence since World War II , " he said . " Not one of them has the natural resources we have . Of course we 'd survive . The master always has told his slave he would n't know how to run his own life . They told Nasser he could n't run the Suez Canal , remember ? " Raymond Aron , a leading Parisian intellectual , has visited Quebec and pronounced himself as satisfied that the province could go it alone . Some economists agree with him , others do n't , and the word " viable " is one you hear often in discussion . More Than Water Pistols Economic questions are of little interest , however , to the militant young members of Quebec 's underground army ? boys like Richard Bizier . The former elevator operator was released from jail last February after serving six months for planting a time bomb in an Air Force building . I found him singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond and baby-faced , with a shy , boyish smile . His months in prison have left no visible mark and it is impossible to believe he ever handled anything more dangerous than a water pistol . A journalist friend told me the cafe was rumored to be a recruiting center for the underground army . Certainly the patrons were of military age . Bizier is their hero . They roared when his name was announced : " Rich-ard Bi-zier , Rich-ard Bi-zier . " The young terrorist stepped forward to the microphone and began to sing . The words belied the childish look of his face . His message was clear : " English , get out . If you wo n't , we 'll make you . " Other performers followed him onstage with belligerent Separatist songs in which the audience joined . When the show was over , everyone stood up . / hesitated , then intercepting a look from a pair of angry brown eyes , rose as well . The young men raised their right arms , spread two fingers in the old Churchillian victory salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends with the words : " Quebec 's history is the one we 'll make together . " The next time I saw Bizier , he was in the thick of an angry demonstration protesting Victoria Day ? a Canadian holiday commemorating Queen Victoria 's birthday . On that occasion police on horseback charged the demonstrators and arrested three hundred of them . On that day too a bomb was found on Victoria Bridge , which spans the St. Lawrence at Montreal . Every week there is a new incident though Quebec newspapers now play down minor acts . It is no longer news when a young man is caught daubing a wall with whitewash , or an English school receives a threatening call . As the Separatist fire smolders , one wonders if it will flare up ? and what will fan the flames . In the English provinces , anti-French feeling is now so strong it is doubtful whether Canada could find a way to remake the constitution to Quebec 's taste without incurring the wrath of the other nine provinces . The English Canadians to whom I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , most are not optimistic . Certainly , Quebec will never submit to anglicization in order to save Canada . In that case , there seems no other possibility but that at some future date she will demand her independence . How that demand will be met by English Canadians is the worried thought with which I left my native province .
