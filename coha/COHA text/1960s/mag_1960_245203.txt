In a new set of instructions , the State Tax Commission directed parents to itemize " income of dependent minor children from personal service compensation . " <P> Such a directive was bound to stir a storm of protest . It did . One outraged parent sent State Tax Commission President Joseph H. Murphy 2 . Others complained that it is hard enough to teach teen-agers the merits of earning their own way , let alone have them subjected to the discouragement of tax collection on every penny . Warned the New York Times , only half humorously : If tax officials persist , they " may find that they are fostering juvenile delinquency , cutting car production , plunging parents into the captivity of their progeny . " <P> With the uproar rising , Commission President Murphy explained that the law has really been on the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end confusion " by inserting special instructions to " clarify " the tax form . At week 's end parents hoped that a bill , introduced in the state legislature to eliminate the controversial section , would give children the same tax freedom ( up to $600 ) they have under federal law .
