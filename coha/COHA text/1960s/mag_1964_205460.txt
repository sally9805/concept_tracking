DIPLOMAT AMONG WARRIORS by Robert Murphy . 470 pages . Doubleday . $6.95 . <P> <P> Other memorialists who have trampled over the well-furrowed ground ( roughly 1940 to 1960 ) covered in Diplomat Among Warriors have been quicker to assign blame and point morals . Certainly Robert Murphy was in a position to do so . For two decades his duties took him to the centers of crisis : North Africa , where he laid the groundwork for the U.S.-British landings ; Berlin during the airlift ; Belgrade , Panmunjom , the Middle East , London during the Suez crisis . But for the most part , Murphy was an implementer , not a maker , of policies . His qualities were composure under fire , persuasiveness and an encyclopedic grasp of detail . <P> In retrospect , Murphy feels that at one point during his 40-year career he should have resigned in public protest . That was in the summer of 1948 when the Russians had sealed off Berlin and Murphy , who was serving as civilian political adviser to Military Governor Lucius Clay , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It consisted at that time of a wooden pole suspended across the highway at Helmstedt-and removable , Murphy was convinced , by a token show of force . The decision to launch the Berlin airlift seemed to him a serious mistake . The dramatic success of the airlift obscured the reality : that the U.S. had meekly surrendered its claims for " surface-level access . " He did not resign , but he adds that he would feel better today about the episode if he had . <P> By temperament and training , Murphy was committed to " obedience to official policy " - an attitude perhaps admirable in a career diplomat but less so in a memorialist . Thus Diplomat Among Warriors has little to say about the overall foreign policy of the period that it covers . But it has a few footnote comments to add to the period 's history . <P> - Pierre Laval was not only " the shrewdest , most forceful personality in Vichy , " but an intensely patriotic Frenchman whose tragic flaw was not : hat he sympathized with Hitler but that ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ability to outsmart them . " <P> - General de Gaulle , from the time of he Casablanca Conference in 1943 , lost all interest in the war and , calculating hat victory was certain , " concentrated upon restoring France as a great power . " He shared with Stalin the knowledge that he could " exact greater concessions in the midst of total war . " <P> - Generals Matthew Ridgway and Maxwell Taylor were responsible for canceling an airdrop on Rome that , by Murphy 's calculations , might have shortened the Italian campaign by eight months . But , he adds , the 82nd Air-orne Division was an important part of the assault plans on Salerno , and may have been withheld for that reason .
