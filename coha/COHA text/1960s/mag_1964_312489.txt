The electronic gadgets so vital to vehicles in far-out space suffer from some far-out troubles . Cosmic radiation sickens their semiconductors . Vibrations and swift temperature changes cause fractures in all-important wires . Lubricants evaporate into the vacuum of space . But scientists are already working on some far-out cures . The latest : a tin-magnesium-aluminum alloy that can be made into wires that grow gap-bridging " whiskers " when broken and soon heal their own wounds . <P> <P> When a wire containing a core of the new alloy snaps , whiskers sprout from both ends of the break . In a few days , the whiskers can bridge a gap one millimeter wide ( about one twenty-fifth of an inch ) and carry one watt of electrical power-enough for most of the delicate circuitry in modern spacecraft . Collision with a sizable meteoroid might result in damage too extensive for whisker therapy , admits Minneapolis-Honeywell Physicist William Jarnagin , who led the team that developed the alloy . But that hardly matters , he adds somberly . " Everything would go then . " <P> Scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slender crystals that seem to squirt out of the metal like toothpaste out of a tube . They grow fastest at 125 F. , which is close to the temperature inside a home hi-fi set , but they grow well enough at average room temperature ( 70 ) , which is common in enclosed parts of spacecraft . Now a spacecraft with a faltering voice or an electronic brain that has become psychotic need not be given up for lost . Allowed a few days to grow , the little tin whiskers will make it electronically healthy .
