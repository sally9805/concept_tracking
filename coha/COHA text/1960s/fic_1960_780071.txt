 | Coleman was an old-timer , and knew just how far he could press the captain . " In the galley , having a cup of coffee . I ai n't supposed to sit here all day and night , am I , and watch the precious stuff ? " Mr. Hall was angry , too , and shaken . " I told you those lines were n't tight enough ! " He advanced on Coleman , eyes wild and fists clenched . I think he would have beaten him if Captain Budington had not stepped between them . Old Bud knew as well as I did that Coleman carried a Malay knife in a sheath up his sleeve , ready to hand . " If anything had happened ? " " Easy now , " old Bud said . " I 'll take care of this , Mr. Hall . " Coleman stood his ground , eying Mr. Hall for a moment . But there was such a terrible anger in Mr. Hall that Coleman suddenly licked his lips uncertainly and dropped his eyes . He squirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall 's gaze he seemed to shrivel and die . Mr. Hall 's wrath was majestic , like a thunderstorm at sea ; impersonal and awful . " I 'm sorry , " Coleman whined at last . " I did n't mean to do no harm , Captain . Ca n't a man make a little mistake ? " Mr. Hall trembled , so filled with wrath that its earthly container was about to burst . I was glad that I had not been the one to tamper , accidentally or otherwise , with his traps . His mission was to him , at least , almost holy . Interfering with it amounted to profaning an altar . Captain Budington looked Coleman in the eye . " It wo n't go so easy with you next time . When I give a man a job , I expect it to be done proper . If that load should come adrift again , I 'll string ye up and give ye a dose of the cat . " Mr. Hall turned abruptly on his heel and stalked off to his cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Back to your work , all . " That was the end of it , for a while . Every ship has its cliques . Sometimes they are so strong in their organization that they will not work properly together ,  | even when the ship is in danger . The test of a good captain is whether he can take all these separate groups and fit them together in a way that lets the work of the ship get on as it should . Old Bud was a good captain , one of the best . The Budingtons of New London were known from the Sandwich Islands to Disko . And so the George Henry plowed on toward Holsteinsborg . Whaling gear was got ready ; the ship 's longboats were newly calked and painted ; lines were examined inch by inch , and coiled into tubs . The aggrieved Coleman had his adherents , who were of the opinion that he had been badly treated by the captain , although their principal grievance was against the landsman Hall . Kudlago was the champion of the other group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This latter group did not generally subscribe to the belief that Mr. Hall would be successful in his search . Instead , they championed Hall only out of dislike for Patrick Coleman . In addition to these principal groups , there were subgroups , common to both parties , who were Douglas men , Lincoln men ; believers in a flannel rag around the neck for a colic , and scoffers at the remedy ; men who had signed the pledge and men who drank a quart of whisky at a sitting ; men who were Baptists , Presbyterians , and Holy Rollers ; men who knew certain intimate biological facts about Esquimaux women , and men who denied their knowledge . I was fast becoming educated in a way my father , or Harvard College either , had never intended . A snowbird came and settled on our rigging , which Sterry told me meant good luck . We passed through a fleet of Newfoundland cod fishers bobbing about in their tiny sloops , far out on the banks . One hailed us , and the captain sold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we came into the latitudes of the northern lights . The days had by now lengthened greatly , so that it was light until far into the evening . After I had peeled a half bushel of potatoes for the morning mess , Cookie turned me loose and I was free to go abovedecks for a  | while . I stood in the bows watching the dying light , only to be aware that as the sun slipped over the edge of the world , a new and growing light waxed in the north . Vertical red and gold rays shimmered and moved like silken draperies . Along the base of the curtain , from end to end , ran a continuous stream of prismatic fires , and golden rays of light jetted upward and raced back and forth . For a long time I watched , fascinated , and when I looked around , the ghostly glow cast a pale radiance on the faces of the crew  --  and on the face of Charles Hall , who stood by my side . His eyes shone back the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the full impact of the light . I spoke to him and he did not seem to hear me . " Is n't it wonderful ? " I asked again . He looked at me , seeming to ponder , and then turned back to watch the scene . Although no more than a pistol shot away , the lights fled as fast as the George Henry and the Amoret came up on them . After a long time , wherein everyone was silent and there was no sound but the licking of the water at the hull , the creak of timbers , and the muffled beat of the whaler 's engine , the lights disappeared from the sky , one by one , fading mutely away until it was full dark . " You may think it very queer of me , Adam , " Mr. Hall said , his voice low and grave , " but I must tell you something . I , who have never been there , love the snows and ice of the North . I love the circling sun , the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find it queer , " I said . " Then you are different from most of the others . " He sighed . " I do not mean to ask for sympathy from any man ; I am strong in that respect , and will continue so . But it is a fact that I have taken abuse from scientific men who discount my theory that I may yet find the lost Franklin men living as natives in the Far North . I gave a lecture once , to raise funds , and was hooted from the stage . I have given up my newspaper , my family , all my hopes of material gain in this life , only to go on a mission of  | love , for that is what I call it . I feel to be in the performance of duty I owe mankind  --  myself  --  God Himself ! " He was so strong in his feelings that his voice quivered . " I know it may sound foolish to those people who are experts in the field , but I believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing , to be left to the experts . They have decided that nothing can be done ; very well ! That is their privilege . I have decided that something can be done , and I will do it . " He was eloquent , and there was a roughhewn sincerity to him that moved me . " I believe you , " I said warmly . " And if there is anything that I can do to help , Mr. Hall , just you let me know , sir . I am your man . " For a long moment he looked at me , his face in shadow , but a feeling of great emotion seeming to emanate from him and I ink us . Finally he thrust out one big hand and took mine in it , wringing it until I almost cried out with pain . " Thank you for that , Adam . " He gave my hand another squeeze and hurried away . On the Fourth of July we were still at sea , almost becalmed , running too low on coal for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a holiday . Cookie made a duff from sea ( biscuit and dried apples , moistened with rum and baked in the oven . There was firing of pistols and much yelling from the crew when old Bud ran up the national colors and announced ; In extra whisky ration to all hands . The extra whisky was , I hink , what led to the trouble that came next . Mr. Hall had been making a dictionary of the Innuit language to guide him in his proposed explorations . Each day he and Kudlago would get together in a protected angle of the deckhouse , and when the Innuit pronounced the words Mr. Hall would write them phonetically in the big ledger he carried . I , too , was interested in Innuit ; I had always had a flair for languages , and when Mr. Hall mentioned that Innuit had no let- ter " c , " and only twenty-four letters in all , that was enough to whet my curiosity . " Muk-tuk , " Hall repeated , writing the word in his ledger . Kudlago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " Muk-tuk , " he said again , trying to correct Mr. Hall . " That word mean whale . ' That very important word . You better learn right , sir . " " Muk-tuk , " said Mr. Hall again , very patiently . Some of the crew members not on watch , enjoying the goodnatured wrangling , gathered around in the thin sunlight , laughing and eying Kudlago and Mr. Hall . They had recently watched Mr. Hall measure the temperature of the sea water with his patent thermometer , and there was much speculation about his prediction that we were near icebergs , on account of the water being only at 34 ? on the Fahrenheit scale . Old Bud stoutly denied it , claiming that he had never encountered bergs so far south at this time of year . " Tupik , " Kudlago said . " That small skin tent my people make to live in . Tupik . " His face became sad , and his eyes were moist . " My woman , my little baby  --  they live in tupik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the session was finished I went below to my bunk . The extra whisky , in which I did not join , had had its effect on the rest of the crew , and there was much singing and scuffling and carousing . I was half-asleep , pondering on the singular lack of the letter " c " in Innuit , when I heard the sounds of a fight going on topside ; loud shouts , the stamp of boots , cheers and curses . I came awake in a spatter of reality , like a soap bubble bursting in my face , and sat up half-dazed . Then I got into my boots and jacket , and hurried on deck . Kudlago and Patrick Coleman were fighting . In the lee of Mr. Hall 's canvas-wrapped longboat they pummeled and beat each other , rolling fiercely about . Captain Budington was bawling from the quarter-deck through his speaking trumpet , and I saw the mate , Mr. Rogers , hurrying toward them . Cole- man was a good head taller than the stocky Innuit , and was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear hug , his head under Kudlago 's chin , pushing hard and forcing the Innuit 's head back at an angle sufficient to snap a man 's neck . But Kudlago was wily . A few seasons in the whalers had taught him the tricks of rough-and-tumble fighting . As I watched , he got a knee into Coleman 's belly and drove it home , hard . Coleman yelled in pain , and relaxed his grip . " Here , now ! " Mr. Rogers yelled , trying to pull them apart . " What 's this all about ? " He grabbed Coleman , and Mr. Hall , who had just come on deck , pinioned Kudlago 's arms . " Stop it now ! " Mr. Rogers shouted . " Stop it before I take a fist to the both of you ! " Old Bud bellowed through his speaking trumpet . " What 's the matter , Mr. Rogers ? What 's going on down there ? By the Prophets , sir , speak up ! " Kudlago motioned at Coleman . " Him thief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call me names , will he ? " Kudlago gestured at the canvas-wrapped supplies . " Him try to get in there . Steal . " With a sudden twist , Coleman broke away from the mate 's grasp and seized a belaying pin from the rack at the rail . With an oath , he brought it down on Kudlago 's head . The Innuit slumped in Mr. Hall 's arms , blood running from a cut over his ear . Old Bud himself broke through the grinning crowd , and although several inches shorter than Coleman , he took a handful of the seaman 's jacket and shook him . " By every Apostle , I 'll put the both of ye in irons ! Now what 's the truth of this ? " " I was n't doing nothing ! " Coleman protested . " I was just tightening the lashings , like I was told ! This drunken heathen rushed at me from behind , he did , and like to choked me to death before I could defend myself proper . " Mr. Hall had Kudlago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page deleted  | page deleted  | ble , and between us we dragged him to the forecastle and put him into his bunk . Outside , in the companionway , the sailors gathered to offer advice . " Something he ate , " Sterry said . " Them Esquimaux , they 'll eat anything ! The worse a piece of meat stinks , the better they like it . " " Rub camphor oil on his chest . " " It 's colic . Give him turpentine . " I tried to wipe the blood off my hands with a rag , and felt myself getting sick . " You had better go outside , Adam , " Mr. Hall said . He and the captain rummaged through the medicine chest , looking for something to bring him around . Mr. Hall shook his head . " A brain fever of some kind , I think . " " Got calomel and spirits of niter and such as that in here . What do ye think ? " Mr. Hall knelt beside Kudlago looking at the ashen face , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . Maybe some sign will show itself  --  a rash or a griping . Then we can know better what to do . " The rest of that day , and all of the night , Kudlago lay senseless in his bunk , Mr. Hall tending his wants and being as gentle with him as a woman . The cook brought broth from the galley , and the captain got out a bottle of Scotch whisky and heated some in a tin cup . The liquor only rolled out of the unconscious man 's jaws . Mr. Hall knelt beside him , talking in soothing tones . " You 'll be all right . You 've got to be all right , Kudlago . I depend on you ! I need you to be my guide and hunter when we get to Cumberland Sound . " Later  --  much later  --  Kudlago woke from his daze . He seemed not to know Mr. Hall or me , but he clutched Mr. Hall 's hand and muttered thickly .  | " Eh ? " Mr. Hall put his ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " An-ge-ko , " I said . " That 's what it sounded like . " " Of course . " Mr. Hall went to the shelf above the bunk and brought down the carved ivory figure . " That 's what he wants . " He put it into Kudlago 's hand . " There , old fellow . There 's your an-ge-ko , or medicine man , or whatever you call him . " After that , Kudlago seemed to rally . His ear no longer bled , and he lay quietly in his bunk , staring at the ivory idol with a kind of contentment . Occasionally he would rouse himself and speak to Mr. Hall in Innuit . " Teik-ko-seko ? " he would ask , over and over . " Teik-ko-seko ? " I asked Mr. Hall what it meant . " He 's asking Is there ice ? ' " Mr. Hall was gaunt and holloweyed from his unending attentions to Kudlago these past days , with very little sleep , and he reeled when he straightened up from his accustomed kneeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to be home again , among the ice floes . " He wrung out a cloth that he had dipped in cold water , and put it on Kudlago 's brow . " Yes , " he said . " We are coming into the ice now . This morning I measured the temperature of the water again , and it is only a degree or two above freezing . " The next morning Kudlago died , slipping away very quietly . They wrapped him in his blanket and buried him at sea , Mr. Hall reading a service over him from the Masonic Manual . Afterward Mr. Hall stood for a long time at the rail , looking at the gray waters that had closed over his good friend . Captain Budington came up and stood beside him , trying to cheer him a little . " He was n't a Christian , " old Bud said , " but the good Lord 's bound to look out for him wherever he 's gone . " " I 'm sure he will , " said Mr. Hall quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Always pulled his weight , and never asked for favors. "  | " That is true . " Mr. Hall went into his cabin . Feeling sorry for him at the death of his friend , I followed him to his cabin hoping to cheer him . At my first knock , no one answered . I knocked again ; no response . Finally , screwing up my courage , I opened the door and went in . I will not soon forget Mr. Hall 's appearance . Disheveled and distraught as he was by his constant attendance on the sick Kudlago , the death and burial of the Innuit had put him in an almost maniacal state . Before others he preserved an outward calm , but in the solitude of his cabin he gave full rein to bitterness and anger long kept down . " Coleman ! " He gnawed at his knuckles , scarcely seeing me . " That devil ! It is queer I had not thought of it before . " His deepset eyes burned . " Of course ! The blow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Adam , what a part I have played in this sorry business ! " He rose and rushed toward the door . Fearing he would do himself harm , or harm others in his rashness , I caught his arm . It was like trying to stop a charging bull , and the force of the encounter spun me around and drove me into the bulkhead . But I cried out after him , and at the door he stopped , breathing heavily and staring at me with eyes like two hard and polished agates . " Where are you going ? " " To settle accounts with the rascal . " " Wait a while . Let me talk to you , first . " As he paused , uncertain , I pressed on . " You have no proof it was so . Innuits are apt to die suddenly and strangely , with no apparent cause . Sterry said it was so . He 's known it to happen . " " No , " said Mr. Hall . " I wo n't let you talk me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . The man must be punished . " Seeing this tack was getting nowhere , I tried another . " Trouble of this sort will not do your expedition any good . You have made extensive plans ; I should hate to see you in chains because of a thoughtless action . "  | His eyes widened as if a strange thought had come on him . The heat went out of his gaze and his bearded chin fell on his chest . His hand dropped from the doorknob and he seemed to slump , becoming inches shorter and pounds lighter . " True , " he muttered . " Ah , Adam , you have hit me for fair ! " Going to the small table and chair that were the only furniture of his tiny cabin , he sat down , head in his hands . For a long time he did n't speak , nor did I. The only sound was the creaking of timbers and the slatting of the sails as the George Henry wallowed on . " Hit you ? " I stammered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I hope you will not think ill of me , Adam . But I must confess that your words struck home , in a way that I must make clear . I was very fond of Kudlago , that is true . But in my anger at Patrick Coleman , I now see that I was not thinking of poor Kudlago . I was only desperate because my own plans had been so upset . It was selfish of me and your words have brought me to my senses . " He shook his massive head in a regretful way . " If you , or the others , only knew what I have gone through to get this far ? " I would never think , nor would anyone , of calling him anything but Mr. Hall . But I did touch him on the sleeve timidly and say , " You will succeed , sir . People will hear of you . " He looked at me with pathetic gratitude . " There are precious few who believe in me , Adam . " I went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rail to clear my head and let my pulse subside , I looked aft . There , over Kudlago 's watery grave , was an immense iceberg , the first I had ever seen . We had come into the ice Mr. Hall had predicted .  | AT LAST we put into the harbor of Holsteinsborg , on the west coast of Greenland . It was late in July , and old Bud was grumpy because the whaling season was rapidly passing ; as yet we had nothing to show for it . We were still a long way from the whaling grounds off Baffin Island , but we were out of coal and fresh provision , and there was no choice but to take on these things at Holsteinsborg . Mr. Hall was pleased to make that port , also , since the mate had told him of Lars Kleijt , a famous Esquimaux ice pilot who might be induced to go along as guide and hunter in his projected trip . I got a good look at Holsteinsborg and did n't think much of it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly set at all , only dipping under the horizon and then corning up again to start the day over again . The harbor was good and landlocked , and there were many buildings of wood and rock , including the governor 's house , a church and schoolhouse ,  | and others to the number of thirty or so . Although the principal city of Greenland and the seat of the Danish colony , it looked to me like a small country hamlet in Ohio except for the towering snow-capped mountains that reared up back of the town . After two months at sea , everyone was anxious to get ashore . Being such a landsman , and not yet good for much but cleaning bilges and polishing brasswork , I had little hope of getting ashore , at least not for some time . But Mr. Hall put in a word for me , and I was allowed to pull an oar in the longboat that went in with Captain Budington and the officers to pay their respects to Governor Elberg . " See there ! " Mr. Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Adam , those are called ki-as , those small oneman boats . And the larger ones with the women in them are called oo-mi-en . " He had quite recovered from his depression , and was jolly and eager . " Did anyone ever see such a land ? " He spread his arms wide and inhaled the cold clear air . " A great land , a big land , an important land ! " " Whales is what I 'm after , " old Bud said . " If we do n't get whales , you can have this icebox , Mr. Hall , and welcome to it ! " Coming in to the dock , we shipped our oars , and immediately ran into hordes of mosquitoes . They hung about us in smokelike swarms , whining and singing , pausing only to tattoo us with red-hot stingers . I had seen mosquitoes around the Ohio River before but these were a new and deadly brand , three times the size and with audacity unmatched by a catamount . Before we got ashore , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met us at the dock . He was a plump and cheerful Dane , speaking excellent English , and quite immune to the mosquitoes . Wearing a gold chain of office about his neck and sealskin boots of spotted fur , he welcomed us in the name of the King of Denmark . Whalers were the chief diversion of this lonely port , and when we reached the governor 's house , only a short walk away , it was evident that preparations  | had been made for the George Henry . A table was laid with duck , salmon , trout , butter , American cheese , and white-flour bread . Flanking this spread were a dozen or two bottles of a Danish strong drink they called akvavit . But these refreshments were for the officers of the George Henry and Amoret , and Mr. Hall . The sailors , including me , were put to work loading coal into tow sacks and dragging them down to our boats . I had never worked so hard in my life as I did the next three days . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy young man , long penned in the classroom and suddenly called upon to use the muscle and sinew that are his birthright . I was black and sooty as a chimney sweep . At night I ached and smarted in every square inch of my body , but I was proud to find that I could keep up with Sterry and Keeney and Stokes and the rest . Besides , labor was somehow different ? transformed and exotic  --  in this remote Greenland harbor , smelling of fish and tar and seaweed . The gulls squawked and wheeled , grinning Innuit children surrounded us begging for pennies , tobacco , sugar  --  it was all new and wonderful , and here was I , Adam Burritt , in the midst of it ! Hard labor is the lot of the sailor , and the sailors from the George Henry worked willingly , not imagining that anything less was expected of them . All of them , that is , but Patrick Coleman . Every ship 's crew has its shirker , its professional gossip and talebearer , its sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is some kind of an electric telegraph in them connected like a spider 's web with the sources of ship secrets . " I hear , " said Coleman , " that our fine Mr. Hall is not getting on too well with Governor Elberg . " It was the third day of coaling and we were all glad of a rest . Usually we let Coleman talk , and paid little attention . But tired as we were , and all of us interested in Mr. Hall , we laid down our shovels and listened . " It is about Lars Kleijt , the pilot , " Coleman said . " Mr. Hall  | wants him to come along to Cumberland Sound and be his guide . " Sterry took out a dirty kerchief and wiped his mouth , leaving a whitened ring like the end man in a " Bones " show . " You 're a nosy one , " he observed . " Better keep your tongue secured , or old Bud will tie a knot in it . " Coleman grinned , unperturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Mr. Hall asked the governor to persuade him , but Elberg wo n't have nothing to do with it . He says it 's a decision for Kleijt to make . They say Mr. Hall spoke very sharply to the governor about it , claiming it 's his duty to aid and assist him ; he 's got a letter of some kind from the governor of Ohio calling on all men to help him . But Governor Elberg never heard of Ohio ; he thinks it is in the Sandwich Islands someplace . " " Talk ! " scoffed Keeney . " If you carried coal the way you flap your mouth , we 'd be done with this here coaling , and off to Cape True ! " " What else do you know ? " someone asked . Coleman looked important . " If you do n't believe what I have to say ? " Sterry grinned . " Ah , we believe you , Coleman . You 're a monument to truth , a whited sepulcher ! " " All right , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance when we finish coaling . On Sunday , that is , after church , in the government dance house . " " A dance ? " I asked . " Whom do we dance with ? There are n't but a couple white ladies in Holsteinsborg ; Mrs. Kjer and Miss Bulou . " Sterry roared with laughter . " Why , Adam , you dance with the Innuit ladies ! Mrs. Kjer and Miss Bulou is for the officers ' entertainment , not for the likes of us common seamen ! " He took a swig of whisky from the stone bottle he always carried with him , and drove the cork back in with a blow of his hand . " What do you think they let us load all this coal for , man ? Why ,  | it 's to get us in shape for dancing with Esquimaux women ! It takes a strong back and great endurance ! Aye , they 'll swing you off your feet and out the window if you do n't grapple with ' em , and stand your ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned . " Some say it 's the rotten fish they eat . Whatever it is , it hangs about them like a fog , and it takes a strong man to strike out through it and find the woman be-neath ! " Someone whistled a warning through his teeth . " Here comes old Bud ! " We went back to our work . A moment later Captain Budington and Mr. Hall came down the path , Mr. Hall with his Greenland dog on a leash . Barbekark , he was called , and Mr. Hall had bought five others too , and paid ten Danish dollars for the lot , along with several bushels of dried fish for their feed while on the George Henry . They had been conferring with Governor Elberg , and from the look on old Bud 's face , the talk had not gone well . Mr. I-Iall was frowning also , and biting his lip . As he passed I spoke to him but he did not appear to hear me . " Now ai n't he got a bug up his bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Mr. Hall . " " He was thinking , " I said , and a moment later I was surprised to find I thought it necessary to defend him . " He often gets into deep thoughts , and is n't aware that someone has spoken to him . " Sterry grinned and clapped me on the back , a sly look in his eye . " If you say so , Adam . " When we were not busy loading supplies ( which was not often ) I had a chance to roam about Holsteinsborg . I did not know either Innuit or Danish , but that was little bar to my enjoyment . A smile , even a friendly word in an unknown tongue , was sufficient to satisfy the Esquimaux that I meant well . They were the most cheerful people I had ever seen ,  | always on the grin . They grinned at me and my knickknacks ? my pocket compass and comb and case knife . They grinned at my furrowed brow and halting speech when I tried to make myself understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , at night and in the morning and during the day . Many times they grinned at nothing at all , apparently on the theory they might have missed a previous occasion and were determined to make it up . " Slice an Innuit through the middle , " explained Sterry , " and he 's made up like a roly-poly pudding . Seal on the outside , for that is what they dress in ; Innuit in the middle ; and inside the Innuit , more seal , because that is what they are full of  --  seal meat . " For a plug of tobacco they would put on a show for me in their ki-as , or canoes . Wearing a sealskin jacket which extended from the shoulders down over the round hole in which the boatman sat , they would turn somersets in the water , spinning over and over till I was dizzy watching them . Because of the tight fit of the jacket , never did water enter the canoe , and the boatman would finally bob upright , grinning , only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of performing was to paddle hard and to drive one ki-a completely over the top of another , nearly amidships . Harvard College , I thought . What a dull place it had been compared to this strange land ! Patrick Coleman , I found , was correct in at least some of his gossip . The Esquimaux Sabbath ended in the afternoon on Sunday , and a ball was planned for us by the governor , to start on the stroke of four . We finished loading our coal and dried fish and other supplies at noon , and spent the rest of the day cleaning up for the event . The forecastle was filled with soapy splutterings ; hair pomade was put on , celluloid collars shined , and boots were blacked . Promptly at four , all except the mate and a small deck watch went over the side , and pulled away to the accompaniment of singing and good spirits .  | " Now you watch that akvavit , " Sterry said , putting a hand on my shoulder . " Adam , it 's a treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquors will give you a warning first ; the dry heaves , or a list to port . But akvavit is different . All of a sudden everything goes black , and it takes three days to revive you . " " Do n't worry about me , " I said . " I do n't drink  --  just a little port now and then , and the wine at Communion , of course . " Stokes , paring blue-black nails with his sheath knife , gave me his opinion on Esquimaux women , going into great anatomical detail . " But mind this ! " he said in conclusion , peering down his long nose at me . " They 're mostly someone 's wife , so make sure first before you take one outside for a walk . " " You do n't need to worry about me , " I said and think I blushed , because they all roared with laughter except Coleman , who only looked at me with a faint smile . The dance was a huge success . An old Innuit sailor named Iron-Face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor with his heel . The governor was there , sitting on a kind of dais with Mrs. Kjer , the wife of the minister , and Miss Bulou , who was the attractive daughter of the governor of the district of Godhaab . Mr. Hall also sat there , with Captain Budington , and both seemed to enjoy themselves although neither danced . They were not missed , however ; never have I seen such wholehearted and spirited caperings . The Esquimaux women and girls were not bashful  --  instead , at the first strains of the fiddle they charged across the floor and collared the partner of their choice , dragging him bodily out on the floor . A short woman in a calico dress and boots of sea-leopard fur took my hand and pulled me after her , laughing and chattering as if she had a prize catch . I was not a good dancer but it seemed to make little difference . Being spun wildly by this lady in a kind of " lancer 's quadrille , " I looked around just in time to see Sterry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them shrieking with joy and excitement . Sterry had the most capital faculty for gaining the  | affections of the fair sex , and proved himself excellent on the variations . A buffet had been set by the governor , and Miss Feoken Bulou and Mrs. Kjer had outdone themselves to decorate the dance house with streamers of dried seaweed , festoons of fishing nets , and piles of varicolored rocks . Panting for breath and perspiring , I excused myself from my lady companion and sat down in a chair by the fiddler , hoping soon to get my second wind . A kind of a berry punch was in a bowl on the table and I took a dipperful of it from time to time , being thirsty from the dancing . Although I am not particularly musical , I noticed that after a while I began to tap my feet , and to clap my hands also . It was not very good music , but it was loud , and it moved me in a peculiar way . Sterry lurched over and shouted in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Finally he gave it up and poured a bottle of akvavit in the punch , tossing the empty bottle through a window someone had opened to cool off . I screwed up my courage and asked Miss Bulou to dance with me . The fiddler , Iron-Face , played a waltz at my request , and we dipped and glided gracefully about the floor . Miss Bulou sometimes winced as I stepped on her foot , but she was otherwise gracious . " You do waltz remarkably , " she whispered in my ear , and smiled at me as she hurried back to the dais . I went back to the punch bowl and had a dipperful . Sterry was emptying another bottle of akvavit into it , but the liquor did not affect the fruity tang of the berries . Remarkable berries , they were ; probably some native shrub that grew at Holsteinsborg . It was about this time I began to notice the strange behavior of my pocket watch . No matter what I did , it seemed to remain obstinately at about seven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drank more dippers of excellent punch , I took the fiddle away from Iron-Face and played a difficult solo , although I am not musical , as I have said . It was still only a few minutes after seven . Sterry wrung my hand and congratulated me , and put two bottles of akvavit into the punch ; it was  | still only a few minutes after seven . I held the watch to my ear and listened to it . The steady ticking puzzled me . I seemed to be suspended in time  --  happy , gay , a devil of a fellow  --  kissing all the ladies , shaking hands with Captain Budington , proposing toasts to the King of Denmark , and eating dried fish with the heads and tails on , which I would not ordinarily do . In a final display of talent , I ordered Sterry to clear the dance floor and performed a Russian kazatsky , arms folded and legs kicking in and out with the precision of steam pistons . The kazatsky was the last thing I had any remembrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for swimming out of a limitless black nothingness ) I was in my bunk on the George Henry . We were at sea , I could tell . A head sea slapped hard into her planking , and the creak of timbers made my head ache . It seemed as if the top of my skull was made of India rubber , and expanded and contracted with each beat of my pulse . My mouth was dry and feathery-tasting , and there were evidences l had been sick . I lay there for a long time , wondering if I had caught some Innuit disease . I tried to get out of my bunk , but found that someone had tied me in with a length of line , and I lay back again , trying to get my thoughts in order . It was a remarkable thing that next happened . As I lay there , sick and dizzy , a scene played itself out in my mind  --  precise , ordered , the voices of the actors crisp and clear . I could recall every detail , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spectator sitting in an orchestra seat . There was Adam Burritt , the principal actor , standing in a snowbank outside the government dance house , feeling very peculiar . I saw myself hold my pocket watch up to my ear and shake it vexedly . Over my shoulder , at stage-right , was a small lighted window , and through it came voices  --  Mr. Hall 's and that of Governor Elberg , with occasionally a word from Captain Budington . They were in a small room that opened off the dais , and I stood there , cold and shivering , winding the watch .  | " I can not help it , " said Governor Elberg . " I have no control over Lars Kleijt . If he will not go with you , Mr. Hall , that is his privilege ! " " You have influence with them ! " protested Mr. Hall . " I will not influence a man to go on a trip he does not want to take . " " Sir , this means everything to me ! My life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a reliable man , a hunter , an ice pilot ! Can you not ? " " This is enough ! " broke in Captain Budington . " Mr. Hall , the governor has been very patient . Now I must ask you ? " " But why ? " Mr. Hall demanded . " I have offered him a good wage . Why will he not go with me to King William Land ? " The governor 's voice was angry . " Why ? Need you ask me why ? Lars Kleijt has no confidence in you , Mr. Hall . He would not guide you for any amount of money , poor as he is . A trip to King William Land with a man who has never been in the Arctic before ! I wonder you are rash enough to attempt it yourself , without asking others to join you in such a scheme ! This is not Cincinnati , Mr. Hall , or Chicago , or wherever it is you come from ! This is the Arctic , and danger is on every hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sorry to say it , but it is true . " There was a long silence , and I remember trembling in the cold . My face was hot and flushed when I put my hand there , and over my head was the late Arctic twilight , the first wink of stars , and the cry of a bird somewhere along the shore . Then the whole scene faded away , and nothing I could do would bring it back , or tell me what happened after . But I knew it had all happened and I had been there , standing in the snow outside the window . About noon , I think it was , Sterry came in . He looked fresh and vigorous , and gave me a hand when I tried to stand up . I reeled and would have fallen had it not been for Sterry . I thought I was dying , and sat down again .  | " You 'll get over it , " grinned Sterry . " Another week or two and you 'll be able to take solid food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , which only made it worse . Sterry handed me my pocket watch , the one my father had given me when I went away to college . " You better take it back . " " Where did you get it ? " " You gave it to me last night at the dance . Told me to take it to a jeweler and have it fixed . Said it was slow . " I groaned again , remembering the remarkable behavior of the watch . My own behavior , it appeared , had been at least as remarkable . " You look kind of peaked , " observed Sterry , " but you better go below and lay aft to the galley . Cookie is mad because you was n't around to lend him a hand . " He stuffed shag tobacco into his pipe , looking thoughtful . " Matter of fact , that 's the general state of mind on the George Henry this morning . Ai n't no one on good terms with anyone else . Old Bud is cross as two sticks . Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something happened last night , I guess . Du n no what . " I could guess , but I did not broach the subject . Instead , I thanked Sterry for his care of me and dragged myself to the galley , where Cookie gave me the sharp edge of his tongue for an hour running , not using the same obscenity more than once . I sat on a stool next to the coal range and peeled potatoes for two hours , my eyes almost closed , because even the dim light of the galley hurt them . Never again , I told myself . I was not cut out for a life of sin and carousing . Early in August we saw the west coast of Davis Strait , having made heavy weather in the crossing . Snow in August was new to me , yet my first sight of Baffin Island came through whirling clouds of snowflakes , each seeming as big as a baby 's fist . The sun was gone , and heavy lead-colored clouds lay all about us ; the waters of Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bucked in the chop , and the wind was ob- stinate and changeable . Without our small steam engine , depending on sail alone , it would have been dangerous to come so close to a lee shore . But Captain Budington was anxious to locate a bay called by the Innuits Ookoolear , which we were to use as a base for our whaling operations and into which we would be frozen for the coming winter . The George Henry clawed her way along the rocky shore , old Bud on the quarterdeck with his brass spyglass to his eye , calling out orders to the helmsman . There was still great coolness between him and Mr. Hall , and the latter stayed very private in the bows , staring over the rail at the land , wrapped in a blanket against the wind . For three days we beat up and down while the weather worsened . It was dangerous to attempt to enter Ookoolear , and we were about to leave for God knows where when two Innuit fishermen in an old and leaky longboat rowed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these was a plump , jolly man named John Bull who was known to Captain Budington from a previous voyage . The other was called Ebierbing , but answered to the name of Joe . He was a handsome man , tall for an Innuit , and of a proud bearing . Through them Captain Budington learned that many whalers were now anchored in a nearby bay called Kowtukjua . " Good anchorage , " said Joe . " Black Eagle there , Georgiana , and True Love . You go there ? " " All right , " said the captain . " We take you for two plugs tobacco , " said John Bull . He pointed to Joe . " One him  --  one me . " In several hours we made Kowtukjua , the Esquimaux Joe giving steering directions to the helmsman . It was a fine sheet of water , over sixty miles long , Joe said , and six wide . As we went in , our steam engine failed us and Sterry went to work to fix it . In the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out to tow us . I wished for a sketch pad and a pencil and some talent to draw the scene . Seven boats in line pulling the George Henry onward , merry voices singing and  | brawny arms pulling in uniform strokes , and all about us the still waters of the great bay , the sheer rocks hemming in the channel , and in the distance the snowy peaks reaching up to the sky . We had no sooner come anchor than Mr. Hall and the captain got into an argument . I was standing near them , having been put on the anchor watch , and heard their every word . " You can not stop me , " said Mr. Hall . " This is why I have come north . I will ask you again , Captain , to put my boat and supplies over the side . " Old Bud was vexed and angry . " Look at the weather , Mr. Hall ! There 's a gale making up . How in the name of Peter and Paul do ye expect to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dirty weather to boot ? " Mr. Hall was very determined . " I have offered John Bull and Ebierbing  --  the one they call Joe  --  money to go with me to the nearest village . They will help me handle the boat . " The wind was whistling now through our bare poles and rigging , and the force of the blow caused the George Henry to strain against her anchor cable . Whitecaps , looking unnaturally foamy and white in the dull light , dashed against her sides , and a spatter of snowflakes drove by . " You are against me , " Mr. Hall said . " You are all against me . Everyone is against me . But I have come here with one purpose in mind ; to find the Franklin people . Now we are here , I intend to go ! " Old Bud 's flat-crowned hat started to blow away , and he pulled it down hard over his ears . " All right , then . Go , God help you ! " He bawled out an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the davits and let it down over the side . " But do n't be a damned fool , sir ! Leave your sledge and your supplies here for now . The weight will swamp your longboat . Take only what ye need for a few days . Look around , visit , pick up what news ye can about the Franklin men , and then come back to us . We 'll be here . "  | Mr. Hall toyed with his plaid muffler , thinking . A scowl was on his face , and a magnificent scowl he could make , too , with his heavy brows and deep-set eyes . " I wo n't inconvenience you , " he muttered . " Williams and Haven Company have been good enough to bring me this far , as they promised . From here on in I am on my own . That was the agreement . " " Blast the agreement ! " old Bud snapped . " I did not bring ye all the way to Baffin Island just to get ye drowned ! Good Lord , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see eye to eye about this fool 's errand of yours , but ye are a human being , or I took ye for one , and so am I , I hope . " Taking Mr. Hall by the shoulder he shook him , half angry and half beseeching . " Go  --  take your damned little boat and John Bull and Joe , if they will go with ye , as ye say . Leave your supplies here  --  they 'll be safe . Stay on the windward side of the bay , and God be with ye , as he is with all sailors . " " Yes , sir , " I said . Almost reluctantly Mr. Hall agreed to this plan . He and John Bull and Joe got into their longboat and Mr. Rogers gave the order to put it into the water . The weather was still making up , and more snow fell . In the lee of the George Henry was a slick of fairly smooth water , and into it went Mr. Hall and his longboat . Joe and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Mr. Hall put up his tiny sail . A moment later the wind caught them and they drove away on our quarter , past the Black Eagle and the True Love . As they drifted away Mr. Hall raised his hat to us in a grave and ceremonial gesture , and then they vanished into the snowflakes . I felt we would never see him again . Captain Budington paced the deck for a while , pausing only to squint his weathered face into the wind for a sight of the longboat . Once , sometime after , I thought I saw the white of their sail against the dark rocks a few points off our bow , but I was not sure . " The damned fool , " old Bud said , coming up to me with  | hands locked behind his back . He stamped back and forth , occasionally peering to windward . Finally he gave it up , and sighed . " Lord , what a man ! He 's a lunatic , that 's what he is ! A raving lunatic ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a decent one . " Ca n't talk sense to him , Adam . Do n't understand sense . All he knows bangs head on , all sail filled and drawing . " He sighed . " Ah , well . There 's an end to it , I fear . " He looked around at the canvas-shrouded bulk of Mr. Hall 's supplies , the pemmican and the rest of it . " Guess we can use the stuff when grub gets short this winter . " That night the storm became worse  --  much worse .  | WHAT could be done with a man like that ? Nothing , I suppose . He was going to King William Land , one way or another , and had not even said good-by to me , whom he might have supposed to be his friend . Even the weather that was making up was of no concern to him . For all my ignorance otherwise , I recognized the dirty weather that was coming and said a quick prayer for Mr. Hall and his two Esquimaux companions . I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved me . The wind had by now increased to a gale , a perfect hurricane , with thick snow . The noise was such that he had to put his mouth to my ear to make himself heard . " Perfect summer weather , ai n't it ? " he howled . The evening sky was filled with sulphurous yellow light . On the horizon was a slash of red , a brilliant carmine band that was strangely out of place . Above and all round us were fleeting clouds of almost jet black , torn into strange and fantastic shapes  | by the wind . Fascinated by this weird display , I stayed by Sterry 's side instead of going below . During Sterry 's watch the Amoret , anchored some fifty fathoms distant from us , began to drag her anchor and slide toward us stern on . " Call the captain ! " Sterry told me . I turned to go , but old Bud was already beside us , equipped with the sixth sense that tells whaling skippers when trouble is at hand . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us stern first , her running lights winking cheerfully . " She 'll miss us , " said Sterry . " See , they 've put out another cable . " They had indeed , and this anchor got some purchase in the rocky bottom . The Amoret sloughed round , coming up hard on her anchor chain so that it tightened like a fiddlestring . But no sooner had this menace been removed than the Georgiana dragged her anchor also and came rapidly downwind toward us . Seeing her come at us , pitching and surging , I was frightened and wondered why the captain did not call for the engine to be started up so as to take us out of harm 's way . Then I remembered ; the engine had broken down while we were standing off Kowtukjua Bay , and we had to be towed in . Sterry was probably still working on it . Fortunately she passed well on our beam . I could see dimly through the snow that her men were on deck trying to put a boat over the side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea I do not know . But having passed us , she was caught in a sudden eddy of gigantic proportions and spun end for end . A moment later she struck head on against a small rocky island near the mouth of the bay . " God help ' em ! " the captain cried . For a moment the Georgiana hung irresolute , a ghost ship , her bare poles black and burned-looking against the yellow sky . Then a freak gust of wind caught her and she was thrown high on the rocks , caught for good , masts and rigging slanted at an extreme angle . Men went over her lee rail like ants over an up- turned bowl , dropping into the foaming surf and struggling to safety on the island . We could do nothing for them . It did not seem possible that our own anchors could hold . Wind and storm and a raging sea had conspired against the whaling fleet in the bay called Kowtukjua . At sea , we could have run for it . Here , in this sheltered bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The George Henry first threw her bows low down , taking the briny sea , and then surged high up , springing on her anchor chain . In spite of the protection offered belowdecks , all our crew were on deck , huddled wetly in whatever shelter they could find . Vessels had been known to capsize in such fearful weather . " We 'll make it now , " Captain Budington said . Dried salt crusted his cheeks , and droplets of sea water sparkled in his chin whiskers . " Thanks to our good Lord who walked on the waters , we 'll make it . " Perhaps we would , but in the pale light of dawn we saw that the Amoret also had been driven aground . For a moment , I could not make out the strange dark bulk on the shore of the bay . Then I realized it was the Amoret , and that she no longer bore any resemblance to a ship . Her masts and rigging were gone , snapped off and broken by the force of her striking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle , and each successive wave bore her heavily up and then dropped her again on the cruel rocks . But there was a fire on the beach near her , and apparently some of the men had been saved . About noon the storm abated further and the snow ceased . A fearful sea still ran , but the motion of the George Henry was less violent . A low rack of cloud scudded across the horizon , but from time to time the sun shone through , lighting the scene of devastation with an unreal and cheerful radiance . " She 'll do , " said Sterry . " What 'll do ? " He clapped a hand on the rail . " Why , the George Henry , of  | course ! Never had a doubt , I did . Beelzebub himself could n't lay a hand on her . No , not even the Prince of Darkness ! " I had not been so sure myself . The great gale of latter August damaged much of the Arctic whaling fleet . At Cape True , the whaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardy and the Rose of Sharon were driven aground , and three men drowned . Another lost a hand when it was mashed between a swinging boat and the rail . The sailor died soon after , a surgeon not being available . In Kowtukjua Bay , two men drowned when the Georgiana went on the beach , and a sailor off the True Love died later of injuries . Of Mr. Hall and his small boat there was no trace . Captain Budington sent Mr. Rogers several miles up and down the bay on a fruitless search for news of him . But in a body of water six miles by sixty , and edged by so many rocky coves and hidden inlets , it was not surprising that no trace of Mr. Hall could be found . Accordingly he was listed in the ship 's log as drowned , and Captain Budington held a service for him . But hard lines were expected in this business . A man did not come to Davis Strait on the whalers without expecting to take chances . And so , after cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other vessels , and burying the dead , the work of whaling went on . A sailor 's " lay , " or share of the profits , could with luck amount to a thousand dollars , and everyone turned to with a will , forgetting his late hardship . Mr. Rogers ' boat took our first whale . All sail set and the men pulling at the oars , they towed the beast in through the channel . Behind them lolled the great bulk of the whale , the first I had ever seen , glistening black where it broke the surface of the water . The blue of the bay was stained with crimson , a bloody track that stretched behind the boat like a tail , curving in a graceful sweep till it disappeared behind the headlands at the mouth of the bay . Someone breathed heavily at my elbow , and I saw it was Patrick Coleman . Running a tongue over his  | thin lips in the way he had , he said in a husky voice , " Aye , it 's a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now ! " He did not seem to be talking to me , or even to notice me . When they chained the carcass alongside , Coleman and Vess and Keeney and the rest swarmed out on the cutting stage , their blubber spades flashing in the sun . Like a monkey , Coleman went down a line and dropped on the whale 's broad back . He raised the spade high and brought it down like an ax to a tree . Blood gushed , spattering him from head to foot , and he hacked away in the dreadful shower like a farmer long denied rain . The flesh of the whale gaped wide and white and the immense body rolled and quivered , resenting this last indignity . The flesh came off in blanketlike pieces , hauled up over the side with a chain fall . Sterry had set up the try-pots just forward of the main hatch , and it was my job to tend the fires under them . Coal started the flames , but soon the boiled-out pieces from the try-pots took over the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance the George Henry might have been taken for a steamship under way , so high and wide went the smoke . The decks ran with blood and oil and bits of flesh , the slippery mush the whalers called " gurry . " The smell was horrendous . A week-dead goat might approach it but could never come up to it . Everything was drenched with oil washing about ankle-deep , and a layer of greasy soot lay over all . I began to damn the day I first saw a whale . Fortunately , to everything there is an end . The clacking of the mincing machine stopped some sixty hours after we first brought the monster alongside . The last of the oil drained from the cooling tanks into Sterry 's casks . All the bone was scraped and bundled ; the tools were cleaned and stowed away , the decks and upper works washed down and then mopped and scrubbed with lye , the carcass of the whale turned loose to drift away . " Over a hundred barrel of oil , " old Bud crowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lads , it was a fine day 's work , and never doubt it ! "  | A day 's work ! I thought . Another day of such work would kill me . Going below , I fell into my bunk just as I was ; stinking , greasy , bone-tired . I think I died , then , but my shade got no rest . In an instant , it seemed , Keeney was shaking me . " Mr. Jessup 's boat just came alongside . Got a big one , lad ! Shake a leg . " I would , I knew , never make a whaler . The days swung by , and I lost track of their count in the endless labor . I became impregnated with soot and grease , like most whalemen ; I developed a set of muscles I was vain about ; I grew salty in my language , to old Bud 's dismay , and raised a sandy beard . True , it was not much of a beard compared , for instance , to Keeney 's red brush . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was proud of it . I thought often of poor Mr. Hall and the tragedy of his passing . He had been a rash and thoughtless man , and what had happened was his own fault , surely . But I could not help but feel that the rashness had not been that of the fool , but only the audacity of a man in a dreadful hurry , reaching for a goal , impatient of obstacle . When I got back to Cincinnati , I would make a point of going to the house on Celestial Street to tell them how he died . In the meantime , I missed him very much . Sterry and Vess and Keeney and the rest were good men , by and large , and meant well ; I enjoyed their horseplay and rough jokes , but at times I yearned for a different kind of talk , something with substance in it . Mr. Hall and I had talked , during the voyage north , of many things ; of Aristotle and Plato and Socrates , of Mr. Darwin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animals and fishes and shells , of books and philosophers and military men and long dead cities . I missed all this , and the strange new sights and sounds and smells of this Arctic world were not enough to make up for it . Well , there was no cure for it but hard work , and there was plenty of that . Now that the whaling was over , we hurried on  | against the day when the George Henry and the True Love and the Black Eagle would be frozen into Kowtukjua Bay for the winter , and the boats could no longer put out to sea to seek the whale . The season wheeled , the sun dipped low over the edge of the world , great blizzards came almost daily , whirling in on us like mad dogs , slashing and biting and moving on to give way to another . During the night an inch or so of ice would form on the bay , only to break up and melt again next morning . But finally , late in September , the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen in . As soon as the thickness of the ice permitted , work parties went out and started their labors . Snow was banked up around the George Henry , almost even with the rail . Split and useless sails were spread over her upper works and snow banked over that also , to bury all but masts and spars in a huge mound of snow and ice . A hole was cut in the bay ice directly beside the ship , to get at water in case of fire . Fire was not too improbable , with the forecastle stove roaring day and night , red-hot . Once caught , the oil-soaked vessel would go up like a Fourth of July rocket . Mr. Rogers found a fresh-water pond ashore , and it was my job to cut up the ice with a long ice saw , hauling it back to the ship on a sledge for later melting and drinking . For this I used Mr. Hall 's sledge and his Greenland dogs . Barbekark , Mr. Hall 's favorite , had the roam of the ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bales and crates , head between his paws , as if waiting for Mr. Hall to return . When I whistled he would come to me , very grave and dignified , to accept a bit of ship 's biscuit or to lick molasses from my fingers . " Good old boy , " I would say . " Where is your master ? " His ears would prick up , and he would look at me expectantly . But that was all . He would blink once or twice , lick his chops , and return to his vigil beside the supplies . Barbekark was an unusual dog , not at all like the rest Mr. Hall had bought , who were vicious and fought constantly among themselves .  | I had known cold before , of course . In Cincinnati the temperature frequently went to zero , and once to eighteen below . But that was nothing beside the cold of Baffin Island . This new cold was a great sucking cold that drew the warmth from a man as a magnet draws iron . The fires roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the temperature only to about freezing . Molasses in barrels became so hard it was necessary to knock the staves away and chop up the molasses with an ax . If left outside an iron pot would split into fragments with a noise like a pistol shot . The bay ice thickened to two feet and then four and eight and ten , so that each morning it was necessary to dig deeper to get to water . The wind blew and blew , never silent , never still . Now that we were frozen in , the Innuit natives visited us , begging for molasses ( which they loved ) , wanting to trade for combs and needles and thread and looking glasses . They were the same as the natives of Greenland I had met at Holsteinsborg ; always happy and grinning , friendly , ready to lend a hand or share whatever they had with you . Many small villages of them lay about us , the people having abandoned their summer tupiks to live now in the icehouses they had built . To pass the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the neighboring ships for a gam or visiting the igloos at the Innuit villages , carrying with me a gallon tin of molasses or a plug of tobacco to make friends . I did not speak the lingo as many of the other sailors did , but most of the Innuits knew some English from the whalers , and with gestures and smiles I got along pretty well . Old George was a favorite of mine ; blind George , or Paulooyer , they called him , who lived in a village about a mile from where the George Henry was fast in the ice . One day in October I left the ship early in the morning , intending to visit George and his family in their igloo . The day was still , the wind having dropped , and the Fahrenheit thermometer stood at some twenty degrees below zero . In the dis- tance the peaks glowed near their tops with the glow from the hidden sun , soon to rise above the horizon for its brief daily visit . When I arrived at George 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow-splashed rays lay across the snow as I walked . George was sitting , as usual , before his igloo , sightless face turned up . Unable to see , the warmth of the sun on his face let him know the direction of the sun , and on a good day he would sit thus for hours , puffing on his pipe and calling out to passers-by . As I came closer , I saw George had visitors . A sledge and dogs were at his door , and from a lance driven into the snow beside the sledge fluttered the hard-frozen bladder of a polar bear ? ninoo , the Innuits called him  --  which the owner of the sledge had recently killed , it being the custom to fly this flag for three days after . George was in conversation with a strange Innuit , a roly-poly little man wearing an old uniform coat with brass buttons over his sealskin koo-lee-tang . I knew about six words of Esquimaux , and as I approached I called out " As-shu-e-tid-ley ? " meaning " Are you well ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . Seeing me , he became frightened and pulled the hood of his koo-lee-tang over his face and turned away . He seized his lance , snapped the whip over the dog team , and away they went , the man running beside them . Knowing the Esquimaux are usually very courteous , I was puzzled . They enjoy meeting others , especially the kod-lu-na , or white man . I turned to George in mystification and asked , " Who was that ? Why did he hurry away so ? " As I asked the question I knew the answer . At least , I suddenly remembered where I had seen the visitor before , if I still did not know why he fled in such haste . It was the Innuit called John Bull , the one who had boarded the George Henry off Ookoolear Bay , and for a plug of tobacco for himself and his friend Joe offered to pilot the ship to Kowtukjua . John Bull  | and Joe had sailed away with Mr. Hall in his cockleshell of a boat on that stormy day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet here was John Bull , alive and well , if unfriendly . Then Mr. Hall might also live ! But my inquiries of George got little information . " John Bull , " he finally admitted , shrugging . " But he 's the man who went away with Mr. Hall in his little boat last August ! He and the one called Ebierbing  --  Joe , he was called too  --  and Mr. Hall . We thought they were all lost in the great storm . " George was embarrassed . He knew something and wanted to tell me , but apparently dared not . His features , normally pleasant and composed , took on a woebegone look . " Maybe , " he said . " I du n no . George du n no , sir . No , by goddam , George du n no at all . No , sir . " " You do know ! " He shook his head and refused to say more . I was at a loss . Something queer was going on , and I felt I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pockets , I found my case knife , a good one with several folding blades and an auger . George had admired it before . " Here ! " I pressed it into his hand . " I 'll give you my knife . It 's the one you liked . " I guided his hand to it and watched as his fingers touched the carved bone handle . A light came into his sightless face . " No one else has got a knife like that , George . It 's all yours , George . Just tell me what John Bull told you . What did he say ? Did he mention Mr. Hall ? " Desire and loyalty clashed on George 's open features . He screwed his face up into the most horrendous grimaces and wagged his head in perplexity . I had put him a nice question in morality , but it was in a good cause . If Mr. Hall was alive , he must be found . " Mr. Hall is my friend ! " I insisted . " If he is alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble , I would want to help you , George . " His fingers caressed the handle , softly , lovingly . " When a friend is in trouble , you must help that friend , " I said . " Is n't that so , George ? " Taking a deep breath , he turned his sightless gaze on me . " Ee-uk ! " It was the Innuit word for regret , or sadness , or disappointment . " Ee-ee-uh ! John Bull no like me ! " " That is n't what counts , " I said firmly . " What counts is helping your friend . " " John Bull tell me no say , but I tell . Hall your friend . All right , I tell . " Turning away from the sun , he pointed north , toward the rim of mountains that hemmed in Kowtukjua Bay . " Hall , he there . Sick , John Bull say . But do n't want John Bull tell anyone . Do n't want anyone know . " He wagged his head , face averted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now . Ee-uk ! " Mr. Hall was alive , somewhere up there to the north ! I felt my heart beat faster . " Where is he ? How far ? You say he is sick ? But why does n't he want anyone to know that he needs help ? " George tried to hand the knife back to me , but I pushed it aside . " You keep it , George . It 's yours . But tell me where Mr. Hall is ! " He waved his hand northward again . " Day . Two day . John Bull very tired . Village at Oolootong . Very far . Hard to get to . " Oolootong ! I did n't know where it was , but surely Captain Budington or Sterry or someone on board the George Henry would know . " Is he very sick ? Is he dying , George ? Why does n't he want help ? " Apparently thinking he had already said too much , George became sullen and would not say more . " All right , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and ran back toward the ship . On an icy hummock a  | good quarter of a mile away I stopped to catch my breath . Blind George stood there , face to the sun , and I think the knife was still in his hand . It had been a good knife and I was sorry to lose it , but it was a fair trade . To see old Bud under ordinary circumstances , one would not have thought him the person he was . In his long wool coat and flat-brimmed hat he looked like the Dunkard farmers who came to Cincinnati of a Saturday morning , bringing chickens and cheeses and vegetables to market . The curl of beard around his plain face , the wrinkles at the corner of his blue eyes , set him off as a mild , uneventful man , living a placid life , unaccustomed to decision . It was the way with most whaling skippers ; they all looked like farmers . But there was a difference when action and great decision were called for , and I would sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brass-button spit-and-polish manof-war types . " What 's this ye 're telling me ? " he demanded . Strugging for breath , I repeated my story . " Oolootong . " He nodded . " A good sixty mile . Clear at the end of the bay . Must have been blown there , and piled up on the rocks . Hurt , ye say ? " " Or sick . George was n't too clear . " " Why do n't he want help ? " " I do n't know that either . It sounds very strange . " While I was wheezing out my story old Bud motioned Mr. Rogers close . The mate had sailed with Captain Budington on many voyages , far and near , and there was a great understanding between them . In response to old Bud 's gesture , the mate was already uncovering Mr. Hall 's supplies and getting together rations for a rescue trip . " Round up the dogs , " the captain instructed Sterry . " Put that brindle one ? " " Barbekark , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out front . He 'll lead , or I miss my guess . " Sterry brought the captain a koo-lee-tang and a pair of skin trousers , along with Innuit boots . My face must have reflected surprise , because the captain glowered at me and said , " By Judas Priest , boy ! Ye think I 'm too old and decrepit for a little trip to Oolootong village ? " " No , sir , " I said untruthfully . Sterry and Vess and Mr. Rogers were busy stowing supplies on the sledge and lashing it down  --  cans of Mr. Hall 's meat biscuit , powder and ball , a musket , a tin of tea , the captain 's little chest of medical supplies . " Sir , " I said . " Eh ? " " I want to go with you . " " And so ye shall . " " I may ? " " Why , I order ye to go ! Adam Burritt seems the only man in the Arctic on good terms with Hall . I have no intention of sledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinate fool . I want ye along to give him the smooth side of your tongue if need be , Adam . Hike , now ; get busy ! " The captain left instructions with Mr. Rogers for the conduct of the vessel while we were gone , and we started off in late afternoon , me in Esquimaux clothing I had borrowed from Mr. Rogers . The moon had risen from her sea bed , and as she sailed higher in the sky the scene was almost as light as day . From time to time the dogs would get the scent of some wild thing and veer from the track with an excited yipping . " Seal , probably , " said old Bud , and lashed them back into line . We might have been the crew of a seagoing vessel , beating to windward on the watery wastes of the South Atlantic . The feeling was the same ; a vast ocean of snow with no landmark , no human habitation , no animal or vegetable life apparent ,  | stiff with ice , and I winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my beard , staring up at the Arctic night , so beautiful after the howling gale . The scene was dreamland , painted in all the delicate tints of the imagination . The night sky was an enormous cupola , blue at the zenith , shading down into green , then lilac and violet at the edges . The stars seemed great and brilliant , bluish in tint , hanging in the sky like the diamonds of some great mogul . The aurora borealis shook out its veil , and curtains of shimmering light waved in the vault of heaven , shot with red and yellow , silver and gold . I began to understand a little of what Mr. Hall had meant when he spoke of loving the Arctic so . Half-drunk with the beauty of it all , I staggered on behind old Bud , feeling almost as if I had again drunk too much akvavit . Reins in one hand , whip in the other , old Bud trotted briskly ahead singing " Rock of Ages " at the top of his voice . This land would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Baptist , but I joined in on the chorus . That was the way we came to Oolootong village , singing so , and hoping to find the lost Mr. Charles Francis Hall .  | I HAD not realized before how life is bound to go on in an Esquimaux village in the absence of the sun . As we came to Oolootong village after a sledge journey of some thirty hours , what I saw at first seemed queer . In white man 's time it was about ten in the evening , but in the light of the moon Oolootong village was wide awake and busy . A dozen igloos glistened in the night , reflecting the moon 's rays as if dusted with diamonds . Each of them had one or more windows of fresh-water ice , and through these lenses danced the warm glow of the lamps within . Through a hole in the ice of the bay a group of women gathered kelp for food , and a small party of seal hunters dragged their prize over the snow , singing and laughing . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a quarter of a mile distant . In response to our hail , a face popped out of a subterranean passage .  | " Kod-lu-na , " old Bud said . " Where kod-lu-na ? " The startled Innuit stared at us as though we were beings from another planet . Oolootong village was a long way from the area where the whalers operated . Finally , accepting some rock candy from the captain , he grunted in what seemed a friendly manner and pointed to an icehouse a little distant from the others , and considerably larger . " Kod-lu-na , " he said . We tied the dogs before the grand igloo and scuttled through the long tunnel on hands and knees . " Anyone to home ? " the captain demanded . As we straightened up , a woman 's voice met us  --  a most remarkable voice ; cultivated , delicate in British accent and inflection . " Good evening , sir . " In the flickering light of the oil lamp , I was astounded to see a graceful and modest Esquimaux woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ki-ete , " she said , motioning . " Come in . " In proper dress she would have been recognized as a lady in any social gathering , whether in Cincinnati or Rome or Paris . Behind her , as my eyes grew accustomed to the rich yellow light , was an Innuit man , fine in appearance , intelligent-looking . " I am called Tookoolito , " the woman said . " Some call me Hannah . And this is my husband Ebierbing . " I recognized the man as the Innuit Joe who had left with Mr. Hall and John Bull on their ill-fated trip in the whaleboat . " Ma'am , " said Captain Budington , " we are looking for Mr. Hall , an American we heard was living here , in Oolootong village . " The woman smiled . " Come . I will take you to him . " Obviously long pregnant , she bent over with some effort and motioned us to follow her through a passageway to another icy apartment within the igloo . Here , lying on a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our search .  | " Adam ! " Mr. Hall struggled up on one elbow , holding out a hand to me . " What are you doing here ? And Captain Bud-ington ! " I was overcome at seeing him again , raised from the dead , though ill and haggard in appearance . His hair and beard were long and uncut , and he was dressed in Innuit furs , the only remnant of his shipside clothing being the threadbare plaid muffler about his throat . His eyes seemed deep caverns under the jutting brows , and there was about him such an atmosphere of physical decay that I almost cried out . " We are here to save you , " I said , dropping on one knee beside him and taking his hand in mine . " Captain Budington and I have come all the way from the George Henry . " " Aye , " said old Bud . " We 've sledged all the way from the mouth of Kowtukjua Bay to take you back with us ! " Mr. Hall sank back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How came you to find me ? " Old Bud gestured to me . " Adam here ran into John Bull . The lad figured there was something queer going on . Paulooyer ? him they call Blind George  --  finally ' fessed up . Said you was up here holed in  --  did n't want no one to come near ye , either . " " I did n't want help ! " Mr. Hall burst out . " I did n't need any help . When John Bull said he was going back , I expressly forbade him to speak to anyone about me . " In the violence of his anger , the koo-lee-tang he wore slipped down and I saw the reason for his infirmity . A huge abscess , the size of a saucer , covered most of his right shoulder . Inflamed , rimmed with a coarse crust , it was vile in appearance and suppurated . " What is this ? " cried the captain . " Man , what have ye done to yourself ? " Hannah slipped forward , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed Mr. Hall gently back on his pillow . " He has hurt himself in the wreck of his boat , sir . He has been very sick . But he will get better . God will see to it , gentlemen . " Mr. Hall closed his eyes and groaned . " It is all my own fault .  | My insufferable pride ! That 's why I did n't want anyone to know I was here . " " Your boat ? " I asked . " Wrecked ? " He nodded and opened his eyes to stare at me ; very feverish , very bright . " Nothing left but the sternpost and a few inches of hawser . The storm drove us for twenty-four hours or more , and we did n't know where we were . Finally we came to Oolootong village , but we lost our sail and oars , and were driven high on the rocks . That is where I hurt my shoulder . Joe and John Bull were more fortunate . " " But why did n't you send to us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter smile twisted his lips . " Ask for help ? After I had parted with the George Henry under such conditions , against all good advice ? No , I thank you , Adam . Not I. " " Well , " said Captain Budington , " all 's well that ends well . We 've come to take ye back . " Old Bud meant well ; he was a religious man and good-intentioned . But he and Mr. Hall generated sparks when they were together . Each was stubborn and uncompromising , and I could see a well-remembered thundercloud spreading across Mr. Hall 's pale features . " Take me back ? Who are you , Captain , to speak of taking me back as if I were a sack of grain , to be delivered sound and full-weight to Williams and Haven ? " Ebierbing  --  the one called Joe  --  came into the room , undoubtedly attracted by the loud voices , and the look on his face and the skinning knife in his hand left no doubt of his loyalty to Mr. Hall . Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his hand in hers . " I do not think you ought to talk to Father Hall so much , " she said . " He is not well . " Father Hall was what these Innuits called him , with love and devotion in their eyes . Deciding that we were getting no place , I spoke to Captain Budington . " Sir , if you will go away for a little while and let me talk to him ? "  | Old Bud shrugged , and chewed at the corners of his beard . " What 's the matter with the man ? I intended no harm ! " " I know , " I said . When he had gone grumbling into the outer room , I squatted beside Mr. Hall and said , " Now tell me your plans , sir . What do you intend to do ? " He stared at me with the same anger in his face , and then he suddenly lay back on the couch again , smiling . " Adam , I am glad you came . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face , although these are good people and I owe much to them . " It was cold in the igloo . A film of wet ice covered the bowllike interior , and the flickering seal-oil lamp did little to take off the chill . I must have shivered in my furs , not being used to such frigid quarters , because suddenly , almost before I knew it , Hannah had slipped off my boots . Very gently but firmly she pushed me down beside the couch and drew my feet into her koo-lee-tang , holding them against her naked breast to warm them . " Here , now ! " I protested . " What 's this ? " Mr. Hall laughed and patted me on the shoulder . " Hannah likes you , Adam . This is a rare courtesy , reserved for those they love and respect . Do n't blush so , lad ! It 's a custom of the country . " " Well ? " " There , now , " said Hannah in her precise and well-modulated voice . " Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a situation before , but I determined to make the best of it . " Yes , " I said . " Thank you very much , Hannah . " " Adam , I 've come into the most remarkable piece of luck here . " Mr. Hall spoke softly , almost secretively , as if afraid he would be overheard . " You know my desire to search for the survivors of the Franklin expedition ? " " I do , indeed . "  | " 1 had thought to look for them in King William Land , because that is where all reports last placed them . " He shook his head in an expression of regret . " Poor men  --  even now eking out an existence in some far-off Arctic village , waiting for rescue , while I lie here with a weevily shoulder ! But no mind ; I will find them soon , because I have found out something from Hannah and Joe and Joe 's grandmother , Ookijoxy-Ninoo ! " Excited , he clutched me by the sleeve . " Adam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somewhere up there is what these people call the Dreaded Land . It 's a land they ca n't be induced to visit , because one time a hunting party from the village went there , and the ground shook under their feet , and they were afraid and came running back . The hair of the hunters turned white overnight , Ookijoxy-Ninoo said . It was an earthquake , do n't you see ? That 's why they call it the Dreaded Land . But Ookijoxy-Ninoo told me something else . There was iron there , she said . Big iron , ca n't move him . ' She drew a picture for me , and guess what it was ! " " I do n't know , " I said . " An anvil , Adam ! A white man 's anvil ! There was coal , too , she said , and a ruined hut , and some buttons and bits of cloth . I believe the Franklin men were there ! Perhaps , after their ships were destroyed in the ice pack , they brought supplies ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes left to guide me , some clue to their present whereabouts ! " Hannah motioned to Joe , and he brought me a tin cup full of meat stew , and a chunk of walrus fat , white and frozen hard . The stew , I suspected , was seal cooked in its own blood , but I was famished and drank it down , burning my lips and tongue . After that , I chewed on the walrus fat , finding it delicious . From time to time I wiped my greasy fingers on my koo-lee-tang , and wondered what my New Haven sweetheart would think of me . " Perhaps , " I said . " But you are certainly in no condition to make such a trip . "  | He stared at the dripping roof , following the course of a tiny water droplet that eventually halted and froze . " Just so am I , " he said , pointing . " Stuck fast here with this illness ! But if I were completely well , there would be another great and insurmountable problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or where in it these bits of evidence are to be found . Not one of these people  --  not even Joe and Hannah , who are my friends  --  will guide me . Adam , you can not realize the terror that strikes these simple people when the Dreaded Land is mentioned . " He nodded at Hannah . " Even this fine lady , who has lived twenty months in England and spoken with the Queen , shares the superstition ! " Hannah smiled . " Sir , there are many things not known to the kod-lu-na . In this land we know these things , and are afraid . " " You see ? " Mr. Hall shrugged . " What can I do ? " " You can do this ; come back to the ship with us , where you will have proper care . " " I have the best of care here . An an-ge-ko  --  a kind of medicine man  --  comes here three times a day and casts spells for my benefit . " Mr. Hall , I knew , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purpose , and I wondered whether he said this to pull my leg . But there was no twinkle in his eye ; only a great resolution . " Besides , to go to the ship would be to turn back . The Dreaded Land is north of here , farther yet from the George Henry . " I could understand why he grated so on Captain Budington . Old Bud was used to commanding , and Mr. Hall was a stubborn and intractable man who could be commanded to do nothing . He might , however , be talked into things if properly approached . " That is true , " I said , " but there are other things to consider . First of all , the rest of your supplies  --  your scientific instruments , your meat biscuit , your books and journals  --  are still on the George Henry . You will need them . Second , you have said that none of these people will guide you to the Dreaded Land .  | But on the George Henry , or in the villages nearby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pulled at his beard , thoughtful . " I do not bring this up lightly , " I went on , " because I have only the greatest respect for you and for your purpose . But it is true that you left the George Henry too hastily , and by so doing lost your boat and were badly injured . Is it not better to go back to the vessel now , to take your time , to plan a little better and act less rashly ? " " So you are against me too ! " He threw himself back on the couch , exhausted , and Hannah crept close to him , a look of concern on her face . " To get thus far , and then ? " I had said all I could , and did not see how further argument could but add to his anger . Water dripped again from the roof and I heard the distant howl of some kind of an animal , probably a wolf . The yellow light from the lamp painted shadows on the wall and Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time I noticed the pattern of tattoo marks on her cheeks . In spite of her residence in England and her meeting the Queen , there was something old and timeless and exotic in her face that made me feel uncomfortable , and wonder how did I come here ? What on earth was I , Adam Burritt , doing in this igloo , squatting here filled with seal meat and blubber , some sixty-five degrees north in latitude ? " Adam , " said Mr. Hall after a while , " it is very hard to be no longer young . You will not understand that ; the young never do . Someday you will realize that you are mortal . It came to me a dozen years ago , when I was thirty , and I saw I had done nothing with my life , and was apt to do nothing in Cincinnati . That is when I decided my life must take on meaning . I was a vain man and proud , and could not accept a life that meant only existence , guttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became interested in the Franklin people and made a vow to go to their rescue . If the rest of the world gave them up , this was all the better ! "  | " You must not talk so much , " I said . " You tire yourself . " He raised a hand impatiently . " I have never spoken like this to any man , and you must hear me out , Adam . It is important , because I begin to see that you might help me , if you understood . It is important that you know what it is that drives me . " He half-rose on his elbow . " I am a vain and proud man , Adam . I know I am going to die soon . I have a feeling of having ascended some mathematical curve and now to be on the downward slope of it , rushing headlong on a steeper and steeper course , at the end of which is only blackness , nothingness . I do not mind that ; it comes to all men in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down into that blackness without being remembered . That is why I am driven so . That is why I must find the Franklin people , or perish in so doing . " He looked steadily at me . " If you know all this , you begin to know Charles Hall . And I want you to know him , Adam . He  --  he is really not such a bad fellow . " " Sir , " I said , " I think I know the gentleman well  --  very well , indeed . And will he now take the advice of his good friend and come back to the George Henry , there to make further plans for going somehow to the Dreaded Land ? " For a moment he looked at me , eyes in shadow so that I could not tell what he was thinking . Then he got painfully up from the couch , knotting the plaid muffler about his neck . " I think it is a good idea , " he said . Our winter wore on . The days began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay ice . Nightly the world was on fire with the aurora , and the temperature hovered at thirty and forty degrees below zero . The bay ice " sang " from the commotion of stormy waters below it , and the improvident Innuits , finding it now too cold and unpleasant to hunt , came daily to the George Henry to beg for food . Mr. Hall , beginning to recover from his abscess ( although still thin and gaunt ) , talked to them in their Innuit tongue , asking about the  | Dreaded Land , begging one and another to lead him there . They all knew of the Dreaded Land ; it was as I , from Cincinnati , might mention Columbus or Cleveland , not very far away . But when he asked them to go they were terror-struck . Even gifts of needles and cloth and mirrors could not move them . That was a bad place , they said . Yes , they had heard of the big iron there , and the coal , and the ruined dwelling and bits of cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No ! No ! As the winter wore itself out Mr. Hall was like a wild man . Feeling better , the abscess almost healed , he became again a problem to Captain Budington . He had no boat and old Bud refused to give him one . The time was rapidly passing when a sledge journey could be made to the Dreaded Land . He drove his sledge to the native villages , arguing endlessly with them , cajoling , begging , coaxing . But no one would listen . They were even reluctant to speak of the Dreaded Land , fearing retaliation from evil spirits that dwelled there , who might be listening to them from afar . " I do n't know what I will do , " he said to me , sitting in his cabin and fondling Barbekark 's ears . " Adam , it is a dreadful thing to be thus blocked , thus frustrated , with the key to the whole Franklin business in my hand ! " " No man could do more than you have tried to do , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face became very grim . " And I will , very soon . If no one will help me , I will go entirely on my own . I will buy a native boat  --  an oo-mi-en  --  and go north alone ! " I said no more , fearing to discuss the prospect lest it cause him to think more seriously of it , and perhaps do what he threatened . When the weather improved , I left the ship and went out with Blind George 's friends hunting seals to provide fresh meat for the ship . Koojesse , Koodloo and his wife Jennie ( who weighed two hundred pounds and more ) , Jack , Suzhi , little Annawha  --  they became my good friends , in spite of their un- predictable ways . An an-ge-ko , or shaman , was always one of the party . It might be old Peong , with his wispy beard and crossed eyes , or again it would be Kargtoon , a greasy young man who was always hungry and operated only upon receipt of gifts of food from his clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . When a seal was killed , the an-ge-ko would sprinkle the carcass with water before anyone was allowed to touch it , and sing for a while over the dead body . Afterward he got the seal 's eyes as recognition of his status , and the people brought him hot blood to drink . While the skull of a walrus was like seasoned oak , that of the seal was paper-thin , and it was Kargtoon 's delight to crack the skull and eat the warm brains with his fingers . But there was , I began to believe , something to these an-ge-kos . They had a great hold on their own people , at least . Occasionally , on our sledge journeys in search of meat , Kargtoon or Peong would suddenly caper about , rolling in the snow , twitching and trembling and shouting at the top of his voice . No matter what was in prospect , no matter the storm or game ahead or imminent peril from a crevasse , they would all come to a halt and gather around the medicine man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering about in the throes of primitive religious ecstasy . When recovered , Peong would yammer at them for hours while they sat around him in a circle ; it was apparently a form of preaching , although I did not know enough of the language to understand . This went on for hours , while I grew cold and miserable and wished myself back on the George Henry . But there was no cure for it . Once in the midst of this an-koo-ting , as they called it , they were all deaf , and resented interference . In spite of this senseless performance , an-ge-kos did have some peculiar power , and knowledge too . A woman in a village near the George Henry had a dropsical condition , and Peong ran a knife into her stomach and let out the fluid . I was there , and I saw it , and the woman got well afterward , so that Peong became famous for a hundred miles about .  | It was inevitable also , I suppose , that I should have trouble with Patrick Coleman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are not happy unless they cherish a hatred , existing on it as others do meat and drink . Coleman was this kind of man . Under other circumstances , I might have liked him . He was an old-time whaler , and his skill with the blubber spade I had seen and admired . But in the enforced idleness of the Arctic winter , he nursed his grudges . He disliked Mr. Hall since the time Captain Budington had taken him down for being careless with Mr. Hall 's deckload of supplies . Now , seeing I was intimate with Mr. Hall , Coleman transferred his dislike to me . " Think you 're quite a case , do n't you ? " he growled at me one day . Having run low on coal , we were reduced to burning some of our whalebone in the stove . It was porous and filled with oil , making a fine fuel , but had first to be sawed and split into logs . " God , if there 's anything I hate , it 's a greenhorn knowall ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ax . I do n't think I was afraid of him , but his words were so obviously an attempt to start trouble that I did not reply , only going ahead with my sawing of the bone slabs on the buck . My silence infuriated him and he went on , savoring his words with obvious malice . " Captain 's pet , that 's what you are , Burritt ! Too highfalutin to mix with us common seamen , ai n't that it ? Might contaminate you ! " This was unfair , of course . I liked Sterry and Keeney and Vess and the rest of the forecastle hands , and had great respect for them as fine men and hard workers . But I bit my tongue and said nothing . Nothing , that is , until he turned his vile tongue on Mr. Hall . " Buddies to that crazy Hall , too , ai n't you ? I seen you going to his cabin all the time . " He laughed coarsely and wiped his lips with the back of his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I been on ships too long to mistake it . " Leering at me , waving the ax to keep time , he began to sing a dirty song . " Stop it , " I said . " You make me . " " All right , then , I 'll make you ! " I flew at him , and the shock of my coming was enough to drive him against the deckhouse , the ax flying from his hands . For a moment we slipped and teetered on the greasy deck , then fell among the scraps of bone . " Take it back ! " I shouted , driving my fists into his midriff . " You damned liar ! Take it back ! " I wish I could say I beat Coleman into senselessness and later , my knee on his chest , forced him to apologize , both to me and to Mr. Hall . But it was hardly so . Coleman had been a long time in the whalers . He knew every trick , every subtle advantage , every way to maim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eel and wound his muscular arms around my chest , squeezing me in a hug like an iron vise . His chin was dug into the nape of my neck , and the pressure made my eyes swim and dark spots dance in my vision . The captain was gone on a visit to one of the villages and Mr. Rogers was in charge . Close in many ways , he and the captain saw differently in this kind of a situation . Old Bud would not have violence on his ship , but Mr. Rogers demanded only that it be a fair violence , conducted according to rules . Almost at once we were surrounded by spectators . I saw Mr. Rogers there also , his face grave , but making no attempt to stop the fight , nor did I want him to . I had struck the first blow ; very well , I would finish it myself . I bent , thrusting out a leg . Coleman lost his bear squeeze and tripped over my outspread leg. - I jumped on top of him and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I said again . " Every last word of it , you lying rascal ! " Again he skittered away beneath me , and at the same time  | caught me on the side of the head with his knotted fist . Lights flashed ; my head rang with the sound of far-off bells ; I rolled blindly over in the scraps of bone and struggled to my knees . I saw Coleman 's boot coming at my head and I rolled away from it , managing somehow to twine my arms around his leg and pull him down again . But this time he fell heavily and expertly on me , driving his knee into my chest , and all the air whooshed out of me in one great sobbing breath . I lay there , beaten and helpless . Almost as in a dream I saw Coleman snatch up the bone ax and swing it over his head . In the nick of time , someone jumped forward  --  I think it was Sterry  --  and said , " That 's enough of that ! " Coleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a salmon . But others came forward and pinioned his arms , and finally he tossed the ax aside , eyes glazed in a kind of stupor . " Go below , Adam , " Mr. Rogers said mildly . He turned to Vess . " Give Coleman a hand with the bone . " I went below and sat on my bunk . Sterry brought a wet slab of meat and held it over my eye , which was rapidly closing . " Beef 's usually prescribed , " he said , " but maybe seal will do . " My shirt was torn from my back , my mouth was cut , my knuckles were barked and bleeding . But I had n't done too badly . " Next time , " I said , " I 'll kill him . " It was an idle and vapid statement , but when you are young you do not recognize defeat . It was not long after that when Mr. Hall got his great chance at the Dreaded Land . It came about in a peculiar way . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baffin Island , a dreadful custom , making sense to them , I suppose , but cruel and inhuman to my way of looking at it . Whenever a person was very sick and his life was despaired of , it was the custom to build a new and fresh igloo in which the sufferer was put , walled in with only a small opening to hand in occasional food and water . So far as I could find from Blind George and Jennie  | qwq it was a neat and practicable system . Moreover , there was fear among the Innuits of contamination by the death spirit ; a person was required to die thus alone , out of contact with his fellows , lest he somehow contaminate them . Now Hannah , or Tookoolito , had been pregnant when we last saw her in Oolootong village . Mr. Hall found out through Blind George , who was a walking newspaper , that Hannah was dying . Because of trouble with her baby she had been put , as custom required , in an isolated igloo to await the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , intending to go at once to Oolootong village and rescue her . But Captain Budington would not hear of it . " I say ye shall not ! This is an Innuit custom , and what they do in that respect is their own business . We depend in the whaling on their good will , and I will not have anyone meddling in their customs and practices ! " " I do n't care what you say ! " Mr. Hall was vehement , and with his uncut beard and wild eyes he looked like a Biblical prophet . " It is a cruel and barbarous custom ! I wonder that you , Captain , being a good Presbyterian , can countenance such a business ! " " I do not countenance it or otherwise . I simply say that it is none of your business , nor mine either . " " The Lord looks on all of us as his children . When one suffers , all suffer . Because this woman 's skin is brown , is that any reason to close our eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two men . To old Bud , his religion was a familiar and everyday sort of thing , as common and useful as his boots or hat , but not , I fear , going very deep below the surface . To Mr. I-Tall , on the other hand , the Christian religion was a mystical thing , tied up somehow  | with his search . In its influence he was transformed , seeing visions , elevated into starry realms which were often impracticable , however Christian otherwise . " If ye go , then , " shouted the captain , " do n't mind to come back , sir ! Ye have caused me enough trouble , and Williams and Haven , too ! Take your sledge and dogs and your damned traps and be gone ! " I felt desolate at this new outbreak between them . They were both good men , God-fearing and sincere . It is a pity that often some ingredient in one man will break out in a rash on the other . But that was the way it had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sledge , and I helped him load his supplies aboard for the trip to Oolootong village again , where he had once gone unwillingly by his boat . " Good luck , " I said . He was still not well , but I had no doubt he would reach the village . On nothing but sheer will , disregarding the limitations of his body , he would do it . " Thank you , Adam . " He wrapped the plaid scarf about his neck , and with a wave to me trudged off behind the heavily loaded sledge . I watched him until he had disappeared into the dark , although for a long time I could hear the creaking of harness , the barking of his dogs , and the occasional crack of his whip . In spite of his high purpose , I was inclined to agree with old Bud . No good could come of this . I did not know , however , that the whole business had in it the key to the Dreaded Land . And if I had known , I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian act of love , or seen in it only a very shrewd maneuver to serve his own purposes . He was a dedicated man , but I was not yet too sure to what , or whom , he was dedicated .  | WE ARE creatures of the sun and can not live for long without it . The Arctic night , the winds , the desolation of ice and snow  --  all seemed to bear heavily on the George Henry , pressing her crew down and ever down into apathy , then boredom , and finally an uneasiness not far from panic . It was a disease well known among the whalers , and could be fought only by activity . Captain Budington knew the signs , and knew also the treatment . He worked harder than any of us simply in keeping jobs laid out ; anything to keep his crew busy and out of mischief . Gear was painted , metalwork polished till it shone . The tools of whaling were gotten out ; blubber spades were honed to razor sharpness , line gone over inch after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rove in . Oil and bone was moved here and there , out of this place and into another , trying , I suppose , to find an arrangement which would make more room for the coming summer 's haul , yet I suspected that  | old Bud was simply at his wit 's end to keep us busy . But after the long winter , even made jobs became scarce . Restless and edgy , we sat in the forecastle , for the most part silent and grouchy , playing San Pedro . Some of the men darned and sewed clothing ; others lay in bunks staring at the overhead , thinking long thoughts . Occasionally there would be a sporadic outburst of activity . Sterry and the older hands would get up a football game , played on the ice in the moonlight with a walrus bladder as ball . One night , almost in desperation , I made a drum out of a cheesebox , and Vess contrived a banjo from a tin pan and scraps of bone . We had a concert that turned into a rough-andready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reeling back and forth , forgetting the Arctic night . But soon that wore out , also , and we sat down again , looking covertly at each other . Would the sun never come ? Were we in some strange Hades , shut off forever from light and heat and growing things ? I thought of grass , how green and delightful it was , and had dreams of lying in a lush bed of it , soft and velvety and fresh-smelling . I thought also of Mr. Hall and envied him his activity . Better die in a howling storm , eaten by one 's own dogs , than lie in my bunk on the George Henry withering in boredom ! But at last the sun came back . Once I had seen it rising red over the southern horizon , I wondered how I ever doubted the laws of physics . It shone like a red coal , a glowing ember balanced on the mountain peaks . Shadows threw the frozen land into sharp relief . How blessed a thing was a shadow ! The upper works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grotesque ghost ship lay alongside us for a moment , the image of the George Henry . Because of the low elevation of the sun , the shadow stretched a mile or more across the bay . As we watched , the sun wheeled and the shadow went around , reminding me of a sundial . Men cheered at the sight and swore , pounding each other on the back . Tin pans were beat on , a charge of black powder set  | off , and the captain ran up the flag . Before we had a proper chance to celebrate , the sun was gone again , dipping below the horizon , leaving only a flush in the sky to mark its passing . But it was enough ; we had seen it , we knew it was there and had not abandoned us . A new life poured into our veins . Men who had not spoken to others for weeks became cheerful and cooperative . Others who had lain for weeks in filthy bunks , wearing foul and tattered clothing , became suddenly sanitary , washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year , brought out a hidden store of raisins and pickles and made a duff from the last of the dried apples . The alchemy of the sun was unbelievable . Day by day it visited us for a longer period . In its growing light and warmth we chopped the George Henry free of her winter prison . From successive snows and storms she had been frozen into a gigantic ice palace , her contour lost , only spars and upper rigging showing above the great white mound . Axes and saws were passed out and all hands fell to , hacking and shoveling . Once we uncovered her to the water line , then the ice saws were brought out . Twenty-odd feet long , they were passed through holes chopped in the bay ice . Two and three men to the handle , we sawed out great chunks of the bay ice , making a narrow channel out to the already weak and rotting ice at the mouth of Kowtukjua Bay . As the spring wore on , we worked stripped to the waist , herding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the channel and out to the open ocean . The time was not far off when the George Henry would fill her sails and move down the narrow corridor to the sea . One sunny day , with fleecy clouds moving windily in the sky , Mr. Hall came back to us , his sledge moving around the edge of Kowtukjua Bay on thin and dangerous ice . I saw him first , recognizing him with the aid of Mr. Rogers ' spyglass , and ran to tell Captain Budington . " Back , is he ? " Old Bud 's face was a study . " There are some people with him . "  | " God help us ! " The captain closed the log , in which he had been writing , and came topside with me , buttoning his black coat . " Aye , it 's him , all right ! " The sledge halted below us on the ice . Mr. Hall came up the ladder hand over hand , with a speed and agility that surprised me . Where last he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even his nut-brown beard seemed to sparkle glossily and his tattered muffler whipped in the wind like a banner . " Adam ! And Captain Budington ! " He shook hands warmly , as if there had never been any problems among us . After him two Innuits came up the ladder . One , I saw , was Joe , the Esquimaux . The other was Joe 's wife , Hannah , the handsome and gracious woman who had nursed Mr. Hall through his sickness at Oolootong village . On her back , strapped in a fur sack , was a baby , a black-eyed , healthy butterball . " I 'm glad ye 're back , " old Bud admitted , somewhat grudgingly . " To tell the truth , I worried somewhat . " " I too , " I said . Mr. Hall chuckled . " A bad penny always turns up . " He turned to Hannah and tickled the baby under the chin with a big finger . " Meet Tuk-e-lik-e-ta , Hannah 's child . You might say I am his godfather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near thing , Adam . " " I am glad it turned out so well , " I said . Old Bud cleared his throat and tugged at his whiskers . He was , I think , wondering as I was , and perhaps embarrassed . But Hannah was not at all embarrassed . She looked at Mr. Hall with love and devotion in her dark eyes . " Father Hall saved me and my baby , " she said . She took his hand in hers and kissed it while Joe nodded with approval . " Everything , " said Mr. Hall , " is in books . In my studies , I neglected nothing to prepare for my explorations . " He threw back the hood of his koo-lee-tang in a vigorous gesture , and his  | deep-set eyes sparkled as he looked about him . " Lord , what a land ! Smell that air ! Look at the way the sun sparkles on the snow ! God must love this land as I do . " I knew he had not come back to the George Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was at Oolootong village . Captain Budington knew this also , and was uneasy . Finally he blurted out , " And what are your plans now ? " Mr. Hall was serious . " Captain , I need a boat . " " I can spare none . They will be needed for the summer 's whaling . " Mr. Hall raised his hand . " Now hear me out , first ! " He nodded at Joe and Hannah . " These good people are grateful to me for saving their baby . Not that it was I who did it , really ; the Lord guided my hand . But nevertheless they want to thank me for it . To do so properly , they have agreed to go with me to the Dreaded Land ! " " But ? " " Think of it , Captain ! These simple , uneducated people , frightened as they are to go into such a place  --  nevertheless they will go , simply to show their gratitude . Can you , a Godfearing and knowledgeable Presbyterian , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I think old Bud swore under his breath , but the words were not intelligible . " Think of the Franklin people ! " Mr. Hall said . " Think of those unlucky men  --  Europeans , white men  --  lost somewhere up there ? " He waved his hand northward . " They are waiting up there in the wilderness , praying for deliverance . One small boat , Captain ; that is all those lost souls ask from you ! One small boat to take me and my company into the Dreaded Land and rescue them from imprisonment . " Hannah stepped forward , eyes downcast . The gilt band in her black hair shone in the sun , and around her neck was looped a barbarous necklace of bear claws and colored beads . Even in  | her odd rig of sealskins , ornamented with dozens of federal copper cents traded for with the whalers , she was ladylike and impressive . " Captain , sir , I beg you to give Father Hall what he needs to find these unfortunate people . " She pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head . " Father Hall has given me this small life . Maybe he can find the Franklin people in the Dreaded Land , and give life to them also . " Saying " The Dreaded Land " in her Innuit tongue , she paled noticeably but her voice was steady and composed . " Please do this , sir . " Old Bud blew out a long breath . " God damn it , what kind of a choice do ye give me ? " " Then you 'll do it ? " " Number four whaleboat has got some rotten planks . I intended keeping her by for a spare . But I 'll warn ye , I take no responsibility for anything . She 's leaky , and cranky in the water , and with a sail up she goes sideways like a crab . " Mr. Hall shouted with delight . He capered about the deck , hand in hand with Joe and Hannah . " I 'll have Mr. Rogers break her out , " said Captain Budington . " For the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave whenever ye 're a mind to . " Convinced against his better judgment , he went below , shaking his head and muttering again under his breath . I followed , intending to lose no time . Knocking at his cabin door , I asked to talk to him . " I know what 's on your mind , " he said , sitting down at his table , the log spread before him and his inkstand to hand . " The idiot 's infected ye too , Adam ! Is n't that true ? " " He 's no idiot . He 's a remarkable man ! " Old Bud shook his head . " They make the best idiots . " He put his chin on his hand , staring at the pages of the log . I realized with a shock that it was the first time I had ever seen him without his black hat . His skull was bare and pink , fringed with a  | grass of white hair . " If Williams and Haven ever ask me again to take an amateur explorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump over the side . It 's easier that way . " " But may I go ? " " Ye signed on for the whaling ! " " I did , " I admitted . " But I 'm willing to give up my lay right now . Only let me go with him ! " " But why ? " " I do n't know . Maybe it 's just that I believe in him . Maybe it 's just that I like him . Maybe he 's a great man , in spite of all , and I want to go with him and do the things he 's bound to do . " The captain picked up his pen and examined the nib . " Aye , I guess that 's it ! Maybe that 's why I have n't thrown him off my ship and bade him go whistle for a boat . " He threw the pen from him and leaned back in his chair , chin on his chest . " I knew Doctor Hayes , and Doctor Kane , and the other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stripe . There 's something in them that drives them on , and on , and on . A touch of spirit that 's denied to the rest of us . " " I can go , then ? " He looked at me with exasperation . " I did n't say ye could n't , did I ? " Grabbing his hand , I pumped it wildly , and ran to find Mr. Hall . In the heavily laden whaleboat it took us almost a month to round the southern tip of Baffin Island and make our way northward into Frobisher Strait . Although this was the long way around to our destination , it was the only way to get there , now that the snow was leaving the land and sledging was no longer possible . So we set our tiny sail , all hands pulled at the oars , and we crept northward through Frobisher Strait  --  Mr. Hall , Hannah and her baby , Joe , and me . For a time , the Innuits being so sociable , we had the company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as we bore northward into this forbidding country , our friends left us . One by one they turned back , for fear of the Dreaded Land . Mr. Hall was in the bows , spyglass to his eye , examining the shore line . From time to time he wrote in his journal , entering measurements made with his thermometer , or the angle to a certain headland . " Adam , " he said , " what do you think of this country ? " I rested for a moment on my oar , sweat running down my neck . " It 's well named . " All round us were forbidding , precipitate peaks , wreathed with gray storm clouds . In spite of the advanced season , the air was cold and metallic-smelling . The waters of the strait were laced with whitecaps , and where we would ever put in for a landing I did n't know . The shore line seemed one long rocky escarpment , ready to pick a small boat to pieces and spit the wreckage about for miles . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no living thing  --  no birds , no seals , nothing . It was as if some Power had put a stamp on this land  --  FORBIDDEN . I shivered and looked at Joe , who was pulling the other oar . He blinked back at me and spat over the side , his brown face pale . Behind him , in the stern , sat Hannah , clutching the Bible Mr. Hall had given her , little Tuk-e on her lap . When time permitted , Mr. Hall was teaching her to read from the Bible . She wet her lips and called out to him , pointing . " Over there , sir . In that break in the rocks . There is a small harbor where we can put in for the night . " In civilized life there are risks , of course , but a man is not apt to be much in danger . Protective barriers are put around dangerous machines , horsecars have bells to warn encroachers on the rails , police are at hand if a footpad accosts a man . Living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially insulated from the consequences of his indiscretions . But here , in this barren and sterile country , we were directly in the hand of nature , and nature did not care whether we survived or not .  | We found that out as we tacked in through the narrow inlet to the bay that Hannah had indicated . One moment , we were working hard with sail and oar , trying to point up into the wind and struggle within the rocky gap . The next , we were caught in a great sucking tide that bore us high and fast , like a cork in a sewer drain . The wind was offshore , that was true ; but pouring through the entrance to fill the bay was a tidal bore that roared and spat foam high into the air , driving us with the speed of a bullet . " Pull ! " Mr. Hall shouted . " Adam  --  Joe  --  pull ! " He stumbled across the thwarts reaching for the sheet , but before he could slack it off the wind ripped our patched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep , he stood in the stern and tried to turn us away from the maelstrom . " Pull ! " he shouted again , pointing northward to the course that would set us at right angles to the current and perhaps take us out of danger . We slewed sidewise . Joe and I dug deep with our oars , and stood on the thwarts with the exertion of our efforts . But our strokes were not together and the only result seemed to be to lay us broadside to the current . We heeled dangerously over and were in danger of broaching . Indeed , our rail dipped once , and a flood of foamy water came over the side . When the boat righted , it lay a foot deep . Hannah , brave but pale , clutched her baby in one arm and attempted to bail with a tin bucket . But we were deep in the water . The battered whaleboat rolled sluggishly , as if contemplating going under for sure . " We 've got to go in whether we want to or not ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone ! Joe , you and Adam stop rowing ! Just hold your oars out , and fend us off from the rocks if we come too close ! " Traveling at terrible speed , we were now only within a hundred yards of the rocky gap . Faster and ever faster we hurtled , the hull actually making a singing noise as we drove on . The dun rocks loomed up fast , larger and larger . The noise was  | deafening as the bore flung itself through the gap . Spray leaped high in the air and the noise was like some great rapids , which indeed it was . To have come so far , I thought to myself , to die . I was not frightened ; only perplexed , and a little sad . " Our Father , " shouted Mr. Hall , " which art in Heaven ? " Standing in the waist , hanging on to the small mast , he put one hand down and touched Hannah on the shoulder . " Hallowed be Thy name ! " We soared up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I poked out my oar , trying to fend us off the rocks . A jar ran up my arm , and the oar splintered and was flung back into the boat . " Thy Kingdom come , Thy will be done ? " The gap was filled with spray as thick as driven snow , and we could see nothing . A swerve of the boat toppled me from my seat and I fell over backward , hitting my head . The ribs shivered and grated , and more water poured in through the seams . Stunned , I lay on my back in six inches of water , staring up at the evening sky . I blinked , suddenly realizing that the spray was gone , the roar of the gap was now only a dull murmur , the whaleboat now floated placidly , although low . " On earth , " said Mr. Hall , " as it is in Heaven . " He still clung to the mast , looking down at me . " If you and Joe will take up your oars and row , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reach that gravelly beach over there , and boil some coffee . " We were low in provisions , not having started with much , and having taken longer to pass through the straits than we intended . The George Henry was also short of provisions , being already almost a year in the Arctic , and could not spare a great deal . Captain Budington , with the interests of Williams and Haven at heart , had sold Mr. Hall ship 's biscuit and coffee and molasses , taking a note for supplies . Mr. Hall was penniless but had promised to pay off the note with money from friends , once he was back in the States . Now we huddled on the beach ,  | drinking coffee and gnawing biscuit , watching Joe stalk an undersized duck in a shallow backwater . It was a peculiar chase , and I did not hold much hope for a duck dinner . But Joe knew what he was doing . Endlessly , and with great patience , he slipped up on the duck . The duck , annoyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing up with a ruffle of his tail . Again Joe would make for him , and the duck would dive . Being forced to stay so much underwater , the duck eventually tired . With a shout of triumph , Joe flung himself on the bird and wrung its neck . " How much farther to where the kod-lu-na house is ? " Mr. Hall asked Hannah , gnawing on a drumstick only half-cooked . Blood oozed down his chin , and he wiped it away with a corner of his muffler . " Two days , " said Hannah . Squatting in the firelight , she nursed her child . " Maybe three . We go to where water stops . " Her voice trembled a little as she spoke of going farther into the Dreaded Land . Beyond her , Joe 's dark eyes flickered in the firelight , and he said nothing . He spoke little , preferring to leave talk to Hannah . " Where the water stops ? " Mr. Hall was puzzled . " But the water does n't stop . " He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out in the firelight . " We are in Frobisher Straits , Hannah . The maps show the straits going north to the Great Arctic Sea . " Hannah shook her head . " Stops up there . " She pointed . " A two-day sail . Maybe three . No more . " Mr. Hall scratched his head . He knew , as I had found out , that the Innuits were great geographers . Almost any one of them could make a sledge journey for a thousand miles and come back with an accurate and neatly done map . Hannah was not likely to make a mistake on such a matter as this . Mr. Hall grinned and threw away the drumstick , licked and sucked clean of marrow . " Adam , just so are great discoveries made ! " He pointed to  | his map . " Frobisher Straits is not a strait at all . It is a bay . The Hall expedition has already made a contribution to science . " It was true . Two days later , having patched up our whaleboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the so-called " straits , " now renamed by Mr. Hall Frobisher Bay . Here we drew our boat up on a sandbar and looked about us . " Someplace around here , " said Hannah . " Ookijoxy-Ninoo is never wrong . " Sniffing the air like an animal , she walked the length of the bar , little Tuk-e in his sling on her back . Back and forth she walked , pale but determined , pausing only to crane her neck stiffly , stare about at the shoreline , and move on . " I will find the place . " Joe , I believe , was too terrified to leave the boat . He sat dejectedly in the stern , looking from one of us to the other in turn , as if waiting to hear the suspension of a death sentence . In a way , I did not blame him . The country at the head of Frobisher Bay was unreal , almost unearthly . Clouds hung near the peaks of the low mountains and beyond the narrow perimeter of sand and gravel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I sank to my knees in the ooze . A sulphurous odor rose up and almost strangled me . No birds were here , no animals , no sign of life . All about was only silence . " Think of it ! " Mr. Hall whispered . " We are here , in the Dreaded Land at last ! This is a moment for history , Adam ! Maybe there are Franklin survivors within a mile or two of this spot . Perhaps they are within sound of our voices . " He took a deep breath and let out a bellow at the top of his voice . " Hallo-oo-oo-oo ! " The sound spread round us in the mists , reflecting back from the rain-shrouded peaks in gentle echoes , growing softer and ever softer until at last completely gone . The only sound was the lapping of water on the bar . " Halloo-oo-oo ! " Echoes , again , and when they were gone it started to rain ;  | a rustling rain that was not far from a mist , although it wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the sun stayed above the horizon until late in the evening . We could not see it , of course , because of the rain clouds that wreathed the mountains , but it must have been almost seven in the evening . " It will be getting dark soon , " said Mr. Hall . " Hannah , do you have any idea of which way we must go to find the hut and the coal and the anvil ( ) okijoxy-Ninoo said was there ? " I think that Hannah knew . She looked at Mr. Hall , however , with expressionless eyes , eyes that were wooden and empty . " I do n't know where , " she said . " I am not sure this is the place . It is very late , too . Maybe we better get in the boat and go back . " " But you told me it was here ! " " I can not tell . It looks like the place , but I am not sure . " Mr. Hall looked at Joe , but Joe only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hall was very gentle . " There is nothing here that can hurt you . I have depended on you and Joe to help me . I know you are good people , and I can trust you . Hannah began to cry , torn between her love for Father Hall and dread of this silent place . Joe , troubled too , came and stood beside her , shifting from one foot to the other , not meeting Mr. Hall 's eye . " Very well , " said Mr. Hall . " Adam and I will go , then . We are not frightened of ghosts or spirits . " He threw the plaid muffler about his neck with a flourish . Picking up his musket he motioned me to follow . " I think it is this way , near that pile of gray rocks that looks like an elephant . " He looked at Hannah and she nodded her head dumbly , but made no move to join us . " Very well , then . Joe , see if you can find some dry twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste good when we get back . " We started up the gradual slope that led to the mountains ,  | floundering about in the ooze , making our tortuous way from one rock to the other . Fortunately , after we had gone a hundred yards or so , the earth became less boggy . " It ca n't be far from here , " Mr. Hall said . " They would have built it near the water , perhaps to be able to launch a boat or to catch fish . " In the misty twilight there was no sound but the scrape of our boots on the rocks , and the sighing of the wind in the rocks high over our heads . Looking back , we saw the orange wink of a fire on the beach below . " Moments like this , " said Mr. Hall , " are worth a lifetime of pedestrian effort , Adam . " His eyes searched the barren hillside . " Perhaps someone is still there , even now , waiting for the sound of a human voice ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , and encumbered with the musket , he scrambled ahead like a goat , pausing only to shout and listed to the echoes that came back . Sweat ran off me in rivulets and my heart hammered in my chest . Let him find it , I thought . It means so much to hint . We found it . We found it by falling headlong into a long shallow pit someone had dug on the hillside , a long time ago . Mr. Hall disappeared from view . When I had crept up to the edge of the pit , I found him sitting in the bottom holding a lump of coal in his hand . " Coal , Adam ! The coal ! " From my perch at the edge of the pit I saw something else in the twilight , a few yards beyond the long trench . It was the ruins of a house , a stone house covered with moss to the extent that it had lost its sharp outlines . I ran to it , and Mr. Hall followed me , clutching the lump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moss , he ran his fingers over the joints between the stones . " Cemented , " he said . " Very expertly , with lime and sand . " Standing beside the house , we could now see the length of the mysterious trench . It had apparently been dug out of the stone with pickaxes and crowbars . About a hundred and fifty  | feet in length , it was oddly constructed , representing an inclined plane starting at the surface of the earth beside us and sloping to a depth of twenty feet or more at the far end , near the water 's edge . " This must be it ! " I cried . Stooping , I picked up something that shone dully in the faint light . It was a metal button , corroded and greenish , with the outline of a kind of upright rearing animal on it . " Look at this , sir ! " Mr. Hall seemed dazed . Instead of sharing my excitement , he looked down at the lump of coal in his hand , weighing it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place ! " I cried . " They were here , some time ago . Maybe they have left a note , something to guide us ! " " Aye , " he said . " Some time ago . " " But what 's the matter ? I do n't understand . " He tossed the coal away , looking at me with an expression that pierced me to the heart . " Look over there , Adam . Do you see the other stone houses ? That pile of rocks near the largest stone house is probably the remains of a blacksmith 's forge . And these ? " He dug the toe of his boot into a moss-grown mound . " Pyrites of iron . There was a mine here , a long time ago . Ah , what a joke on me , to waste a whole year in coming at last to  --  to this !

These ruins have nothing at all to do with the Franklin people . I should have known from what the old woman said ! The stone houses , Adam , are all that is left of the Frobisher party , which left England in the year 1577 and came here to dig for gold . " " But how do you know ? " " I have read Sir John Barrow 's book on Frobisher . " " What , then , is the long trench ? "  | " They built a ship here , Barrow says . Look ; in the bottom of the trench you can see the remains of the wooden trestles they used . " " And we are the first white men here since ? " " I suppose so , " Mr. Hall said wearily . Seeking to cheer him , I said , " Well , that is not a half-bad record ! A new bay discovered , and the three-hundred-year-old remnants of the Frobisher expedition . " " That is not what I came here for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame seemed bent and defeated , losing its outline and form much as the stone houses had done under their covering of moss . " Oh Lord , to trick Thy servant so ! What have I done ? Adam , I wasted a year in this wild-goose chase ! A year out of my life , and out of theirs , also ! " He meant the Franklin people , of course . " No man can blame you , " I said . " Look at what you have done ! With no experience , you have come into this land , lived like one of the lnnuits , learned their language , explored hundreds of miles on sledge journeys and by boat , determined that this strait is not a strait at all , found the Frobisher site ? " " No , " he said . " I have failed , and that is all it can be called . " When we got back to the George Henry , it was late in the season . As a matter of fact , we were lucky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hall was desolate , keeping to his cabin , talking only to Joe and Hannah , whom he had prevailed on to accompany him to the States in an attempt to raise funds for a new expedition , this time to King William Land where he believed he should have gone before . As well as I had known him , he seemed to avoid me . I believe he was ashamed of his debacle , as he called it , although he had no reason to be so . We reached St. John 's , in Newfoundland , late in August of 1862 . That was when I first learned the South had gone to war against the North , and also that Mr. Lincoln had been elected President in such a terrible time . At New Bedford I left the  | ship . Captain Budington insisted on paying me my lay , and I had six hundred and eighty dollars in my valise . Saying good-by to Vess and Sterry and Mr. Rogers and Joe and Hannah and the rest , I went over the rail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave without farewell . But as I walked away up Merrill 's wharf he called to me . " Adam ? " He leaned over the stern rail , gaunt and haggard in appearance , the old plaid muffler whipping in the wind . " Thank you , boy . Thank you for everything you have done for me ! And good luck . " I waved back , and trudged toward the railway station .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | would talk a bunch of courthouse loafers into going down to the Federal Building to sign up with him , and then they 'd make him colonel . No , that was n't for me . I 'd been to Harvard College for a year , and I 'd had experience as a whaler , too . I talked it over with my father and decided I 'd go to Washington , D.C. , to try for a commission . Before I left on the steamcars , I remembered Mr. Hall had lived in Cincinnati , on Celestial Street . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 1051 . A quiet , soft-spoken woman answered the door , two small children peeking from behind her skirts . " Mrs. Hall ? " I asked . " I 'm Adam Burritt . I was with your husband last year when he went to the Arctic . " She looked at me uncertainly . " He  --  he is n't here . " " Where is he then , ma'am ? " " I  --  I think in Washington . " A woman who does not know the whereabouts of her husband is apt to be at a conversational disadvantage , and she fussed at her apron and pushed the children farther behind her . " Well , " I said , " I had hoped to see him . " I turned to go , thanking her , but she took me by the arm and pulled me back . " Wo n't you have a cup of coffee , Mr. ? Mr. ? " " Burritt , " I said . " Adam Burritt . " The house was well kept , but small and drab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabbage . On a carved stand near a window was a framed water color of a bride , and a bearded groom which must have been Mr. Hall , although the resemblance was poor . His wife put a lump of coal in the stove and measured coffee into a pot . " I did n't mean to be short with you , but we 're all alone here , just me and the babies , and my land , you did look so rough with that beard and stocking cap ! " Over coffee and oatmeal cookies she made me tell her the story of the voyage , interrupting every now and then to hush  | the children or to say nervously , sitting on the edge of her chair , " Yes , that 's so . That 's exactly what he said . " It became quite late . Mrs. Hall invited me for supper , saying , " It 's not much . Just boiled cabbage and potatoes . " But I was talked out . She had kept me gabbing for three hours or more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some cookies for me to take on the train . " If you should run into him , " she said , wrapping the cookies in paper , " tell him  --  will you tell him we miss him , and think of him always ? " Suddenly she burst into tears , clinging to me and weeping . " Why does n't he come home , Mr. Burritt ? Why ? Tell me why ! I 've been a good wife all these years . I 've put up with everything because I love him . I 've borne his children , I 've scrubbed floors and cooked and done sewing to buy books and maps for him . Does n't he love me any more ? Has he forgotten me and the children ? " I was embarrassed at the sudden outburst and did not know quite what to do . " Well , " I said , " I do n't know , ma'am . He 's awful busy , you know . He 's probably planning a new expedition . There 's a lot of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? well ? " I broke off , angry with myself at being forced to make excuses for Mr. Hall again . It was not the first time it had happened , and it would probably not be the last . To compound the confusion , the children started to weep also , in sympathy with their mother . Being tenderhearted , I felt tears well into my own eyes , and considered fleeing the scene . But Mrs. Hall hushed them and held out the packet of cookies , drying her eyes on the hem of her apron . " I did n't mean to cry . " She seemed angry and put out . " They 're my troubles , and I 'll deal with them myself somehow . But you 'll look him up , perhaps , and tell him you saw us and we were well ? " " I 'll do my best , " I said . " And thank you for the cookies , ma'am . "  | I went away feeling puzzled and perplexed , and more than a little unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I walked up Pennsylvania Avenue looking for the War Department building . Promenaders sauntered in the hot sun . Loaded hacks rumbled among the horses of officers , and elegant ladies drove in barouches , with black coachmen and footmen . At sidewalk stands pitchmen hawked patent soaps and elixirs . I stopped at a stand under a canvas awning and bought an orange to suck . Across the street a man with a lung-testing machine bawled for customers . Eating my orange , I went up to a policeman in a blue flannel coat and a straw hat , and asked him where to find the War Department . " Up there . " Grinning at me in a sly way , he pointed up the street . " Corner of Seventeenth and F. They 're waiting for you , I suppose . " " I do n't know , " I said , " but I doubt it . " I found the place all right , but it did n't do me much good . A man in a flowered waistcoat , damp with sweat , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what I wanted , he scribbled something on a piece of paper and told me to wait . I waited all that day , finally going to sleep on the wooden bench . When I woke up the clerk was gone for the day , and I went down the street and found a room at a brick house  --  number 1740 , it was . Tomorrow , perhaps , I would go back and try again , just to satisfy my father . But it did n't look as if they needed officers there . In the morning it was hot again . It had rained during the night , just enough to make the air steamy and oppressive . I went back to the War Department . Another clerk listened to my story , promising a Colonel Halliday would see me if he had time . Thanking him , I went out and sat down on a bench in a little park nearby . It is a small world , made every day smaller by the telegraph and steamships and railway engines . Sitting on my bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park , writing in a ledger . My eyes popped in disbelief . It was Mr. Charles Francis Hall . If I had any doubt , the tattered plaid muffler hung limply from his neck . Why any man would wear a wool muffler in Washington in August , I did n't know . " Adam ! " He stared unbelievingly at me and then jumped up , the journal and his notes falling to the grass . " Adam Burritt ! " He pumped my hand . " Of all people ! What are you doing here in Washington ? " I told him . " And you ? " " Trying to raise money for my next expedition . Writing a book . Seeing congressmen and senators  --  the Army , the Navy ? anyone who might give me a hand . " Motioning me to sit beside him on the bench , he carefully rearranged the notes in his journal . " I am glad to see you again . When you left the George Henry , you went in such a hurry . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see me . " He nodded and stroked his beard . " It was foolish of me , I know . I am often childish , and easily hurt . I was desolate , really . To have gone north , and then to fail so ! I did n't want to talk to anyone ; even ? " He put his hand on mine . " Even a good friend . " I told him I had been in Cincinnati , and had visited his family . " You did ? " He seemed pleased , but not overly concerned . " That was nice of you . " " Where are Joe and Hannah ? " " We are living in a boardinghouse on H Street , near here . They will be pleased to see you , Adam ! They are part of my traveling circus , you might say . Barbekark is here too , tied up in the back yard and suffering in this terrible heat . We have been giving talks wherever we could find an audience , asking for contributions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need it ? " " You will need money when you go to war . "  | " I 'm not sure I 'm going , " I said . " At least not right now . " I told him about my experience at the War Department . " But what do you plan to do ? " " I do n't know . " He looked at me for a long moment , pulling at his beard . " Then come with us , Adam ! Be part of Professor Hall 's magnificent Tent Circus and Arctic Display . " He laughed and banged me on the knee . " You can sell tickets ! With that scraggly pink beard and stocking cap , you 'll set the right tone for my talk . " " You 're joking , " I said . " No , I 'm not . " He slumped on the bench , looking at the scuffed toes of his boots . " I will make no apologies for my little company , Adam . It is a sorry thing when a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worthy purpose . But I still believe there are Franklin people alive , somewhere , and they must be rescued . I will solve the riddle of the Franklin expedition if I have to black boots to do it . " Impressed as always by his sincerity and determination , I said , " If you really want me ? " " If I want you ? " He sat bolt upright . " Adam , will you do it ? It will be like old times again  --  all of us together . You and me and Hannah and Joe and little Tuk-e and Barbekark ! " I had not really wanted a sash and shoulder straps . And I had tried . I picked up my valise and said , " Of course I 'll do it . I 'll do whatever you want me to . Now , where is this rooming house ? H Street , did you say ? " From that chance encounter , I stayed two years with Mr. Hall and his Tent Show , as he ruefully called it . How we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the George Henry went the first year , paying for an endless succession of dingy rooms , cheap sausages and bread and coffee , with an occasional nickel left over to buy a cake of ice to give Barbekark a bath . Born in the Arctic , the poor dog suffered in the unaccustomed heat , and the  | ice bath was all that saved him . Hannah and Joe , too , suffered from the heat . Sometimes I wondered why they were so loyal to Father Hall , and endured so much without complaint . They were stared at , treated rudely , and several times refused rooms because the proprietor thought they were " colored . " But through it all Hannah remained ladylike and composed , and Joe was always gentlemanly , much more so than many of the people they performed before . " If it help him , " Hannah told me one day , " I do anything for him . It is up to Father Hall to say when we do n't try any more . " Our little troupe performed in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hudson , Elmira  --  in these and many more we set up our show and tried to make money for the expedition . Hannah and Joe would sing Innuit songs , and dance ; I acted as barker , ticket taker , and what might be called sergeant-at-arms when someone got unruly . Barbekark pulled a crude sledge across the stage , and Mr. Hall , at the end of all this , mounted the rostrum and spoke for an hour and a half about his latest expedition , and showed some of the Frobisher relics . But our financial condition remained poor . The reviews were not bad ; one critic commented , " The lecturer could not claim polish or ease of oratory , but secured close attention by the tact and enthusiasm of these conversational discussions . " It took a lot of money just to keep us all living and breathing and ? need I add ? ? eating . The war was going badly too ; people were worrying about places like Vicksburg and Lookout Mountain and Chancellorsville , and had little interest in us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . Ever since his illness from the abscessed shoulder at Oolootong village , he had been subject to spells of weakness ; indeed , often fainting . A doctor in Boston diagnosed it as thickness of the blood and prescribed two pounds of raw beef each day by way of thinning it out . But prime beef was expensive , and this took our exchequer down even further . Besides , Mr. Hall was working on his book ; having some trouble with it , he had to hire an English- man , a Captain Snow , to help him . Harper Brothers had already made all the advances they cared to . Until the manuscript was finished , they would advance no more . So we struggled on , making a few dollars here , receiving a few contributions there , but dismayed to see it all eaten up by living expenses . I do n't know how Mr. Hall took care of his family . I did n't ask , and he did n't mention them , although he did sometimes write to his wife . Perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had friends who might have helped  --  Mr. Henry Grinnell was one , but Mr. Hall still owed Grinnell quite a sum of money for financing his first expedition and hesitated to turn to him . We might have gone on this way for a long time , getting nowhere , if it had not been for the fresh disaster that struck our party . In New York City , on a windy February day , Hannah 's little boy Tuk-e died . For some time the child had been ill , coughing and having trouble with his breathing . Mr. Hall brought in a doctor , with the last money we had . " Something wrong with the lungs , " the doctor said . " Consumption , I 'm afraid . " " Consumption , in such a child ? " The doctor nodded gravely . " It 's common among aboriginal peoples such as these . " Hannah cradled Tuk-e in her arms , singing softly . After a while she said something to Joe in Innuit which I did n't catch . " But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps . Rest  --  good milk and fresh vegetables . A trained nurse would be helpful . " He might as well have recommended green cheese from the moon . Hannah appeared to have forgotten her English . She spoke sadly to Mr. Hall in Innuit again , pressing her lips against Tuk-e 's feverish cheek . " What does she say ? " I asked . " She wants an an-ge-ko . She thinks an an-ge-ko could help Tuk-e . " Mr. Hall sighed . " I do n't know where a man could find  | an an-ge-ko in New York City . But the worst of it is , it is all my fault . I talked Joe and Hannah into coming to the States with me . And look what I have done to them ! Poverty , sickness  --  now even death , perhaps . And for what ? " A few days later Tuk-e died , very quietly . Hannah did not realize the boy was gone until Mr. Hall , tiptoeing into the room , saw the staring dead eyes and felt the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the small form . But Father Hall prevailed on her , and we buried Tuk-e . We were penniless . Even Hannah , that good and gracious lady , had given up . Desolate at the loss of Tuk-e , she sat for hours in a rocker at the window , staring out at the street . " Do n't grieve so , " I said , trying to comfort her . " Little Tuk-e is in a far better world by now than we are in , you and I and Father Hall . " Used to her gentleness and unfailing courtesy , I was taken aback by her sudden anger . " What do you know about it , Adam Burritt ? How can you tell me this ? It does n't cost anything to talk , that is right . " She flung herself to her feet , wrapping her arms about her as if to keep from flying apart in sorrow and grief . " My baby is dead , here in this cold bare land . Tuk-e is dead , sir . I have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall wherever he wanted to walk , to help him , to cook for him , to do whatever he said . But now look at me ! " Her dark eyes shone like jewels , hard and glittering . " The God that Father Hall tells me about is not good , or why would He have taken my baby away from me ? What good is Tuk-e to Him ? That God is great and powerful . He does not need a small baby ! " Walking quickly about the room , she forgot her English and lapsed into Innuit , raving and almost incoherent . From time to time I heard whalers ' words ? strings of profanity that shocked and saddened me . In her grief poor Hannah was irrational . " Hannah ! " I begged . " Please ! Do n't carry on this way . I am very sorry for you , but this will do no good . "  | In the midst of her railing she stopped , hands still clasped about her , her brown tattooed face frozen in lineaments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoarse , almost a whisper . " You are right , sir . It does not do any good . Tuk-e is dead . That is all . " Coming to me , she took my hand in hers , patting it , holding it to her cheek . " You must not bother yourself with me , " she said , tears in her eyes . " I am a bad woman , Adam . The devil just got into me , that is all . " " No , " I said . " You are a good woman , Hannah . One of the best . It is just that times are bad with us . " " I think this is the end for Father Hall . " " Yes , " I said . " This is the end . " But I reckoned without Mr. Hall . One day , coming into his room in search of him , I could not help but note the latest entry written in his journal . " Our greatest glory consists not in falling , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , he greeted me . I was somewhat embarrassed , but he did not notice and sat heavily in a chair . " Adam , we are going to Washington . " " Washington ? But how ? " " I have talked Harper Brothers into giving me a little more money for the chapters I have just finished . " " But what good will it do us to go back to Washington ? " " Washington is the center of the universe now , with the war going on , foreign military missions there , representatives of European newspapers . I am going to put everything I have ? all my strength , what funds I have been able to beg , borrow , or steal  --  into one great assault on the problem . I will rent a hall , advertise in the papers , plan one last show . If that does not do it , then I will give up . " He looked up at me , eyes burning in their sockets . He was sick , I knew , but undaunted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not want to . The Lord knows a young man like you , in the prime of life , has many opportunities denied to me . Go , if you want to ! " " I wo n't go , if you need me ! "  | He sighed and put his head in his hands . " God knows I need you , and Hannah and Joe , and any good friend I can get . Friends are hard to come by when a man is thought to be a crackpot . Even at Harper Brothers they are beginning to think that ? " He broke off , shrugging . " Well , what does it matter ? " Unity Hall was a drafty brick building near the river , damp and ill kept , soon to be torn down to make room for an addition to the Observatory . Gaslights flickered on peeling walls , and a day-long airing by an indifferent custodian had removed much of the musty smell , if only to replace it with the dank atmosphere of the Potomac . It cost us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only hall available in the crowded city . Because of some clause in the deed to the hall , it was not permitted to sell tickets , as we had wanted . Instead , Mr. Hall intended to ask for contributions at the end of the lecture . We placed a small advertisement in the Evening Star , and hoped for a good house . People started to arrive early , and I peered out through the dank curtains . The hall resounded with the clack and banging of chairs , the hum of voices , the rustle of feminine finery . Mr. Hall had sent invitations to several scientific men and professors who were interested in the Arctic . In the main , they had heretofore been unimpressed by his efforts , taking especial pains to point out his lack of education and training , but he hoped tonight to convince them . I saw one of them in the front row , pointed out to me by Mr. Hall . " Professor Thorne , the one with the gray beard and pince-nez ! Beside him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was flushed , and I do not doubt he had a fever . Feeling that the daily ration of beefsteak was too much for our purse , he had given up this prescription , insisting he felt better . After our little show , which was received with curiosity but not much enthusiasm , Mr. Hall stepped up the lectern and poured himself a glass of water ; nervously , I thought . He had  | no notes . He never used notes . The whole case was in his head . I , too , had heard his talk so many times I could almost repeat it by rote . " Fellow citizens , " he said , clearing his throat . His was a good voice and he knew how to use it . Against the hiss of the gas jets and the rustle of people and their breathing , his words came hard and sharp , with great conviction . " I wish to deal tonight with the sad and lamentable case of the last voyage of Sir John Franklin and his ships Erebus and Terror to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were listening well . " I see among you many scientific men , men who have visited the Arctic , as I have , and explored there . I know they are acquainted with the facts . But for you others whose support I seek , I will restate the facts . In May of 1845 , some eighteen years past , Sir John Franklin set sail from England on a voyage of exploration , with a total of a hundred and twenty-nine men aboard his two ships . In the latter part of July of that year , the ships were seen in the vicinity of Lancaster Sound , north of Baffin Island , at a north latitude of almost 74 degrees . Never more were they seen by civilized man . " It was a dramatic and impressive start . He went on , telling about the relief expeditions that had been organized to search for the vanished ships  --  Sir James Ross , McClintock , and the rest  --  and explained why he thought they had failed . Warming to his task he demanded , " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party ? Can they be yet alive , some of them , living in hardship and peril in the frozen North ? " This was his chief point , of course . He went on to tell them about himself , his studies , his correspondence , his obsession with the Arctic , and his recent expedition there . " For the past ten years I have studied this riddle . I have read everything that has been published on the subject . I have corresponded with Lady Franklin herself , who is as anxious as I am to find the answer . I believe I am now on the right track . "  | Now was the time to ask for funds , to press home on the note of American enterprise and intelligence now taking over where other nations had failed . But a disturbance arose in the audience . A voice called out , a voice casual but authoritative . " Mr. Hall ! " It was Professor Thorne . He dangled his pince-nez from its ribbon , and it swung ominously in the gas flare , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been kind enough to invite me to attend your talk this evening . I thank you for this courtesy . " He smiled and looked down at the swinging spectacles . " But for this courtesy I am bound to extend to you a similar one  --  my opinion of your theories . " " Sir , " said Mr. Hall , " I am not quite finished . If you will bear with me ? " " No matter , " said Thorne . " There is little more to be said anyway . The whole subject has been exhausted . " Someone tittered , and the audience rustled in anticipation of a diversion . Thorne was well known as an extemporaneous speaker and a wit . Mr. Hall held up his hand to silence the growing buzz of comment . " Only a moment ? " " Mr. Hall , " said Thorne , his voice rising , " you have wasted my time , sir , and the time of these good people . I think this is a calculated fraud , trading on the good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer a puzzle , and has not been for some years . It is well established that all those unfortunate men have perished . What good will it do to suggest further risk of life and financial expense ? What can be done now that has not already been done by well-qualified Arctic experts ? " Mr. Hall became angry . " I will tell you , sir ! So far what has been deduced ? A meager theory , from scant evidence ! So long as there is a possibility that one of those unfortunate men is still alive , why should not  | attempts be made again and again until all the facts are known ? Are there not Esquimaux now living in those frozen lands ? Why is it not possible for some of the Franklin survivors to be living there also , eating Esquimaux food , the raw flesh of seal and deer , dressed in furs , sustaining life day by day and waiting for delivery ? " " It is hardly possible , " Thorne said . " A white man could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach is not used to it . " " But I have done it ! " Mr. Hall fairly roared the words . " To one educated otherwise , as we whites are , feasting on uncooked meats is repulsive , but I say eating meats raw or cooked is entirely a matter of education ! " Uproar fed on uproar , and several troublemakers began to catcall and stamp their feet . Others , wishing to avoid trouble , rose and started to leave the hall . " Only a moment ! " Mr. Hall begged . " Wait ! There is a box at the door for your contribu-tions ! " " Mr. Flail ! " Professor Thorne shouted . " I can not allow you to appeal for funds for such a project without it being understood what your qualifications are . You are not a scientist , nor ever have been ! You are not educated or trained in this field , and have made one short trip north , that due only to the kindness and generosity of Williams and Haven , the whaling firm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you propose to ignore the experts in this field , you propose another wild-goose chase to the Arctic , wasting the money of wellmeaning citizens to satisfy your own morbid curiosities ! No , sir , I can not countenance this , nor will I. Sir , you are a humbug , and an impostor ! " " Wait a minute ! " Mr. Hall held his hands high in supplication , but the damage had been done . " Wait a minute ! Please . All of you . Listen to what I have to say ! " Tittering started , a cruel tittering that grew into guffaws and jeers . " Sir , " said Professor Thorne with finality , " I am very sorry  | for you . " He turned and walked out , followed by Dr. Beckett . Others joined in the exodus . " Please , listen to me ? " Hurrying down from the stage , Mr. Hall took an arm here and a sleeve there , begging to be heard . " There is a box in the doorway there ! Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " They brushed past him , some sorry for him , some delighted , some frankly hostile , but none of them giving the contribution box anything but amused smiles . A man in a plug hat overturned the box with his cane , and someone else kicked it into a corner . " Fake ! " a raucous voice called . A young lady who looked gentle and demure otherwise slapped at Mr. Hall with her reticule . Outside , a summer rain had begun to fall . " Wait ! " Mr. Hall called , but there was no one to speak to now . The hall had emptied and the spectators were all gone , some hailing hansom cabs , others turning up their coat collars , still others waiting under the trees for the rain to stop . " Wait , " he murmured . " Please wait . " We had decked the foyer in bunting and wrapped yards of it about the contribution box , hoping to appeal to some patriotic motive . Mr. Hall picked up the box with its bedraggled bunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was custodian of Unity Hall came up and said , " It ai n't but a few minutes past nine , Cap'n . You got almost another hour before your twenty dollars is up . " Mr. Hall looked at the box and plucked off a bit of torn bunting . The bunting was wet from the rain , and the red and blue dye ran off onto his hand . " I sha n't need the rest of the time , " he said .  | MR . HALL , as I have said , owed money to his friend Mr. Henry Grinnell . Grinnell , I later found , was a good and great man who had contributed from his private fortune over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to various Arctic expeditions , that being a field in which he was greatly interested . But Mr. Hall , proud and obstinate , refused to accept any more aid from Grinnell . Indeed , he hesitated even to communicate with him . " I owe him so much , " he told me , " that I can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable , also  --  but in his warm support and encouragement . " Now , in the depths of our despair , came a telegraph message from Mr. Grinnell . CAN YOU MEET ME WILLIAMS AND HAVEN NEW LONDON 17 MARCH DISCUSS POSSIBILITY NEW EXPEDITION ? Mr. Hall showed me the message . When I finished reading it he took it from me , crumpled it into a ball and flung it from him . " It is n't fair , to tempt a man so . "  | " What do you mean ? " He went to the window of our lodgings and stared into the street below , hands locked behind him . " Why , I mean just this ! I am discredited from one end of the country to the other . No responsible authority believes me capable of anything . I am a fool , a mountebank , a subject for jest . " He pointed to Hannah , rocking silently in her chair , and Joe , who was whittling at a stick of firewood  --  our last . " I have done myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have brought them to the brink of poverty . You also , Adam  --  you have wasted two years of your young life following me about . And now this ! " He kicked savagely at the crumpled paper . " If I were half a man , I would thank you all , and then cut my throat with a razor . That would be the humane , the sensible thing to do . " I had not often crossed him , but now I conceived it to be the right thing to do . " Fiddlesticks , " I said . " Eh ? " He looked at me over his shoulder , startled . " You are feeling sorry for yourself . I have not complained . Hannah and Joe can speak for themselves , but I am convinced they are ready to go north with you whenever you say the word ? north or to Hades , if that is where you propose to go . " Hannah stopped rocking . " Sir , " she said to Mr. Hall , " Adam says the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you say , always . " Sitting on the bed , Joe nodded and went on whittling . Mr. Hall ran a hand through his hair . " No one owes me anything . " " But you owe us something , " I said . " Eh ? " " Why , just this ! We have our own lives , you know . We have linked them with yours , for better or for worse . If we are not to count all this wasted , all of our struggles and doing without , then we are bound to try again , are we not ? And again , and again  --  whatever it takes . " Mr. Hall was a man who lived for the most part within  | himself and did not often show strong emotion . But at my words his face betrayed the inner struggle tormenting him . Looking from one of us to the other , he clawed at his beard and scowled ferociously . " Do you think so , Adam ? " I nodded . " Hannah  --  you and Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded vigorously . With a muttered word that might have been thanks , although I do not know , Mr. Hall swept us all into his embrace . " This time we 'll do it ! " he shouted . " With such friends , I 'd try the Pole itself . " From our straitened circumstances we were swept up on a tide of rich good fortune . Mr. Henry Grinnell was a fatherly man out of whom shone the light of a good , an almost saintly , soul . Although wealthy , he was now in difficult circumstances himself because of his unremitting support of Arctic exploration . But wealthy or not , he had a tremendous amount of influence in New England . A word from him was enough to cause Williams and Haven , his good friends , to set about finding a way to put a whaling vessel at Mr. Hall 's disposal . " Not only that , " he explained , sitting back in his carved chair , eyes twinkling through steel-rimmed spectacles , " but I have arranged for you , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . " He consulted a memorandum pad before him . " Let me see  --  ah , here it is  --  next week , on Tuesday . I am to introduce you . " Mr. Hall was disturbed . He tugged at his beard trying , I think , not to scowl , which was such a habit with him . " I do n't know how it will come out . My lecturing has not been going too well . " He told Mr. Grinnell about his experience in Washington . " I would not worry about that , Charles . " Mr. Grinnell  | smiled and took him by the arm . " I have been doing missionary work for you . It will go well , you will see . " Mr. Williams , of Williams and Haven , was a spry and elderly gentleman with a quick and curt way of talking , all the time capering about like an ancient stork . " Yes , yes ! I remember Mr. Hall ! Of course I do . Do n't forget a man ; no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . You too , boy  --  sit over there . What was your name , now ? Adam , that was it . I 'll never forget it , make your mind up to that . Adam Burritt . A and then a B , just as in the alphabet . I have little tricks to jog my brains . " Good-natured and indefatigable , he dug me in the ribs , winking , and went on springing about the room . Mr. Grinnell told him about Mr. Flail 's plans , old Williams nodding and scratching his nose . Mr. Hall showed him some of the Frobisher relics , and made a very good and detailed presentation of his plans to explore King William Land . " I am not a finished speaker , " said Mr. Hall in conclusion . " Perhaps I have convinced you , sir , and perhaps not . But I will finish by saying this . Whatever it is humanly possible for a man to do in the way of finding the Franklin people , I will do . I would give my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not promise success in such a venture , but be sure of this : Williams and Haven can someday be proud of having assisted in a worthy venture . " Old Mr. Williams whipped out a handkerchief and blew his nose , looking brightly from one of us to the other . " Remarkable ! Very remarkable , indeed , sir . " 1-Ie wheeled around and stared at me . " What 's your opinion , Adam Burritt ? " Mindful of courtesy to elders , I got to my feet and stood at attention . " Sir , I know Mr. Hall , and have traveled with him in the Far North . There is no one I respect and honor more . I count it a privilege to be associated with him , and I know you will never regret helping him . " " Good , " said Mr. Williams . " Very , very good , boy . Well , we will see what can be done . "  | The upshot of it all was this : Williams and Haven decided to put at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out with us a deal whereby a kind of co-operative project could be carried on . The Thomas Yates would carry on whaling operations whenever time and circumstances permitted , hoping that the take of oil and bone would pay for the voyage . But Mr. Hall 's Arctic operations were to take precedence , and the search for the lost Franklin people was to be first order of importance . Mr. Grinnell would talk to some of his friends and get what funds he could from them to assist , but in any case the Thomas Yates was going north , with Mr. Hall in general charge . A sailing master , of course , was to be furnished , accountable to Williams and Haven for the safety of the vessel . Before Mr. Hall left with Mr. Grinnell to fill his speaking engagement in New York , we had a champagne supper in the Gibbs House in New London . Mr. Williams was there , and his partner , Mr. Haven ; also Mr. Hall and me , along with Joe and Hannah , the mayor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Williams paid the bill , and all had a gay time , toasting Mr. Hall and wishing success to his venture . Afterward , Mr. Hall and I sat in our room , I a little giddy from the champagne . Joe and Hannah , who did not drink , were sleeping in their room down the hall . They had been a sensation . One of the newsmen was writing up a story on them for the New London paper . With luck , the Boston papers might print it also . Mr. Hall was thoughtful . He paced the room and finally said , " Up and down , eh , Adam ? A few weeks ago I was in the depths of despair . Now  --  a vessel , an invitation to address the learned do-nothings of the Society , even financial support . All or nothing  --  it seems there can be no middle ground for me . " He lay down on the bed , legs crossed , hands locked behind his head . " I was made to plumb the depths , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then added in an amused tone , " Even champagne ! We now drink champagne . " The champagne must have loosened his tongue . I never knew him so loquacious . " It would be nice if my wife were here to see me address the Society . But it would be very expensive . We need all our money for my expedition . " He chuckled . " My wife is very moral , and strait-laced . She would not like champagne . But she is a good woman , and has always stood by me . " I wondered if he had written her of late , or sent money , but I did not say anything . " Well , she is entitled to her ways . We are different , all of us . I am different , you are different ? " He broke off and rolled over and sat up , looking at me . " You are indeed different , Adam . I suppose that is why I like you . " " Different ? How ? " A change came over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sadness , or mere thoughtfulness ; I did not know . " Why , Adam , you are so  --  so ? " He stammered and seemed embarrassed . " Look at me ! I am so unfamiliar with the characteristic I seek to describe that I ca n't find the proper word for it ! " His journal lay on the writing desk , and he picked it up thoughtfully , holding it in his hand . " I can write things down ? I am never at a loss there ! " Such a feeling of bonhomie between us was rare , and I enjoyed it . Mr. Hall was silent for a moment . Then he said , choosing his words , " You are  --  congenial , Adam . Yes , that is it . Congenial . " He tossed the ledger back on the desk . " People like you . You have a knack for making friends readily . With Mr. Henry Grinnell , for instance . And old Mr. Williams was quite delighted with you . There was an electrical spark that flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sparks , " I said . " That 's just it , of course ! " Mr. Hall got up , agitated . " Those  | that have it are just those who are not aware of it . And those poor devils who do not have it are only too aware of it ! Some , for instance , are thought thorny and difficult , but this is unfair . It is only that they do not know how to handle friendship . They mean well , but they have a way of grasping at a sentiment too hard , and perhaps breaking it  --  through unfamiliarity , I say , and not because of any lack of appreciation ! " Uneasy at his vehemence , I said , " Sir , this is a little thing . I would trade all this electrical fluid you say I possess for one small part of your own ambition , your drive , your conviction and abilities ? " " A little thing ? " He shook his head , smiling ruefully . " Because I have not this little thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacking this human and wonderful rapport , I buried myself in books at an early age  --  Lord , how early ! But then , books are not too bad , really . They have been my only true friends , though the bookish man longs sometimes for people , for human friends . " " But you have friends ! Mr. Grinnell , Mr. Williams  --  Hannah and Joe and myself ? " As if feeling he had said too much , Mr. Hall sat down at the desk and opened his ledger . " You know , " he said , " that I have never let a day go by without writing in my ledger . This day is almost gone . " " Well , " I said , somewhat piqued , " I do not wish to disturb you . I will go down and take a little walk before I go to bed . " He did not answer and I left the room . As I closed the door he was hunched over the desk , pen scratching in the candlelight , his bulky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , a worm in our apple of good fortune . I suppose there always is . I found out about it when Mr. Hall returned from his trip to New York City with Mr. Henry Grinnell . I had been kept busy with building a boat and a sledge in the Williams and Haven yard , and did not know that Mr. Hall  | had returned until he entered the shed where Joe and I were steaming runners into shape . " Well , sir , " I said , " you have returned to us safe ! " He nodded and took off his hat . There was something so dispirited in the gesture that I was concerned . Something must have gone wrong at the Society . " But what is wrong ? Was not your speech a success ? " He sat down on a keg , unknotting his muffler . " I suppose so . Oh , they do not take me very seriously , I fear ! If it were not for Henry Grinnell 's sponsorship , I do not think they would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them . But then , I am used to rebuffs of that nature . " " But why are you so solemn ? " He looked down at the tattered plaid and picked at a worn thread . " I have had bad news since I returned . Williams and Haven have withdrawn their offer of a vessel . They have had reverses , news of which just came . One of their whalers was lost near Disko , when fire broke out aboard . Another , bound for England with a cargo of oil , was sunk by a Confederate gunboat . All in all , things have gone very badly for them  --  and for me . " Catastrophe again ! I laid down the sledge runner I had been working on . How many times had the story been the same ! " But what will we do ? " " I do n't know . " Mr. Hall went to a window obscured by steam and wiped a clear place with the corner of his muffler . " There appears to be nothing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yates into the European trade , hoping to recoup some of their losses . The chances are risky , but the return can be tremendous . Well , by next year the circumstances may have changed in our favor again . " " Next year ! " He nodded , staring out the window . His hair was becoming noticeably gray ; more so , it seemed , since the trip to New York  | City . His beard was flecked with it , and his usually erect figure drooped . " Next year , " he murmured . " A year is a long time ! " " To you , Adam , perhaps . And to the poor Franklin people , if any are still left alive . But for me the years go too fast . Ah , they race by ! My vital juices dry up , and the body stiffens . My joints ache , Adam , and I feel very old . " It was the first time I had ever heard him express doubt that he would someday find at least a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whistled between his teeth . " One more year ? " " Long time . " Joe laid down the clamp he had been using and looked at it as if it were a new and strange instrument . " Do n't know if Hannah and Joe live one more year in this place . " He shook his head . " Need snow and ice . Need seal , need took-too . Need everything , bad . " He had never complained before , and it was a measure of the gravity of our situation . " The whalers have all gone for the season , " Mr. Hall said . " I am afraid it 's too late to work anything out . But next year ? " " There may be no next year ! " I protested . " Joe and Hannah want to go home , and the Army will be after me , I am afraid . Already I have been asked several times why I was not in uniform . " " You are free to go , both of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I have been grateful for any help , I have not liked the idea of dragging others into my struggles . " His eyes , under their jutting brows , were filled with despair . When I was young and roamed the green hills along the Ohio River , I saw that look in the eyes of trapped animals . " No , Crazy Hall is not so crazy , or so heartless , as to attempt to keep you with him , Adam . You are a young man , as I have said . Go find your fortune . " He turned away , but I was so bitter and upset that I called  | after him , saying some obscene thing , something I had picked up on the whalers . " Eh ? " He turned , looking at me with mixed amusement and incredulity . " What was that , Adam ? " Embarrassed , I dropped my eyes . " I only meant  --  well , I will go with you next year ; if you still want me , that is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Joe and Hannah , for whom he had a parent 's fondness and indulgence , as he did for all the Innuit people . But his eyes , so weary and harried , softened as he looked at me , biting his lip and pondering . Then he turned away . Joe and I went back to our work on the sledge , not knowing now where our efforts might lead . Several times during the next year I wondered whether I had been rash in promising Mr. Hall to stay . The New London winter was harsh and miserable ; not the clear blue cold of the Arctic , but a bone-chilling frigidity that struck through any number of coats and sweaters . The dampness was everywhere . When I got out of bed in my furnished room of a morning , the windows would be coated with a rime of ice . Our landlady was penurious , and a scuttle of coal was as hard to come by as diamonds . We lived together again ; Mr. Hall and I in one room , Hannah and Joe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privy . How we got by I do not clearly recall . Joe and I did odd jobs for Mr. Williams in his shipyard , for which we were paid , not handsomely , but the rates were fair enough . Hannah did needlework for the New London ladies , at which she was very good , and it distracted her thoughts from the loss of her baby . Mr. Hall worked on the proofs of his new book , to be called Arctic Researches , and managed to get some few more dollars from Harper Brothers , although most of that had to go to Snow , the Englishman , who had sent a large bill for services in connection with editing and smoothing Mr. Hall 's rough draft of the manuscript .  | In the spring , Mr. Hall went on the cars to Cincinnati for a brief visit with his wife and family . I did not leave New London except for a short trip to New Haven to see the girl I knew there when I was in college . The visit was not , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , I did not resemble the callow and pomaded young gentleman Emily had remembered . I did not even stay to supper , although both hungry and invited . Well , Emily was not a patch on a woman like Hannah ! I supposed I was cut out for an Esquimaux wife , although it appeared it might be some considerable time before I had the opportunity to court one . Although I had doubted it , the spring came on . The trees put on a mist of green , New London 's streets were a quagmire from melting snow , the winter-sick sun began to get a little body to it . Williams and Haven were still in financial troubles , but they were planning to send out the Monticello this season to the Hudson Bay whaling grounds . It was a far cry from our original lofty plan , but the Monticello would set Mr. Hall and his party ashore near Repulse Bay in the latter part of the summer . The distance from King William Land where Mr. Hall planned to explore was still extreme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a long and carefully planned journey to reach there . But it was all that was offered us now , and Mr. Hall accepted . On July 1 , 1864 , we sailed from New London on the Monticello , accompanied by the tender Helen F. Again Mr. Hall 's sledge and boat and supplies were stowed on the foredeck of an Arctic-bound vessel . Poor Barbekark , suspecting some great venture , went nearly mad , barking at every gull that lighted on the rigging , finally to collapse exhausted , tongue hanging out . Joe and Hannah were so excited they wept , looking ahead to a long-delayed reunion with friends and kin of their own tongue . Mr. Henry Grinnell was at the dock to see us off . While Mr.  | can and instruments , Mr. Grinnell took me by the arm and led me aside . " It is a thrilling prospect , eh , Adam ? The departure of a ship makes my pulse race . " " It is indeed thrilling , " I said . He sighed . " I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and cheer on those who are better qualified . " " If it were not for you , " I said , " those who are better qualified , as you call them , would remain at home , and nothing would be done in this great Arctic business . " Adjusting his spectacles on his long nose , he peered at me . " Adam , I have only one request to make . In all else I leave judgment to you . " " What is that ? " He nodded toward the foredeck where Mr. Hall , no longer seeming weary , nor gray either , ran among the seamen calling out orders and assisting . " Charles Hall is a worth-while man , Adam , else I would not have bothered my old brains with him . He is stubborn , not too grateful , and very opinionated . But he is a great man , for all that , and someday the world will listen to him . Have you heard his theories about the use of balloons in the Arctic ? " " Aerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No matter . " His eyes twinkled . " Well , at any rate , Adam , keep an eye on him for me . Watch out for him . These last years he has been so busy he has not had the opportunity to develop as gracefully as he might . Talk back to him , Adam ; question him , force him to think things out , encourage him . Be his conscience and his friend . Will you do that  --  for me , and for him ? " I was taken aback at how neatly Mr. Henry Grinnell put it . He knew Mr. Hall as well as I did . " It is a big order . " " It is , but no one else can do it . "  | I took a deep breath . " I 'll try , Mr. Grinnell . " Bad luck dogged us , it seemed . Late in August the Monticello put us ashore at Whale Point , which the captain believed to be on the Wager River . Due to a mistake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles south of where we intended . Mr. Hall had planned to sail up the Wager River in our small boat , reaching Repulse Bay itself before the winter season set in . In this way , we could make preparations for a spring journey to King William Land . But the mistake in navigation cost us dear . With the winter storms already setting in , it was too difficult and dangerous to reach Repulse Bay at this season . Instead , we were forced to sit out the winter in this unfavorable location and wait for spring . " Destiny , " said Mr. Hall , " is a black dog , about the size of Barbekark , which pads along in my footsteps , pausing only to sniff at my marks and put a foul spell on me and my plans . Well , Adana , there is no cure for it . " I did not particularly like the country south of the Wager . It was bleak and forbidding . Game was scarce , and the few natives who lived in the sorry villages were inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they were in worldly goods . Now that the Monticello was gone , we were alone with them , however , except for an occasional whaler that passed by , running down Roe 's Welcome . Even the whalers , it seemed to me , were different in this country from the vessels that fished for the great whales in Davis Strait . There , off Baffin Island , there seemed to be an easy , almost co-operative relationship among the vessels . The skippers , though stern and Godfearing , were in the main just men and fair in their treatment of the crew and the running of the ship . For the most part , those vessels were owned by Williams and Haven or the Knox brothers or one of the other great whaling firms . Standard practices and business customs had been set up which provided a fair  | degree of control of the whaling business . But here , in the Hudson Bay country , the situation was different . Most of the whaling vessels were small and mean , owned and captained by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeseparing blackguard , exploiting his crew , the natives , and anyone else who got in his way . No , I did not like this country , and often wished we were back at Kowtukjua Bay again . Hannah and Joe were delighted , however . The storms , the steady dropping of the mercury thermometer , the cold dry air ? all these seemed to revivify them . Barbekark , too ; after long imprisonment in our New London back yard , he showed only too plainly he was glad to be home , wagging his tail until I was afraid it would fall off from overuse . Though chafing at our forced stay in the Wager River country , we kept busy enough . Joe and I caught fish and soon had a mountainous pile , all glassy-eyed and frozen hard , for dog food . Hannah sat daily and most of the night in her tupik , working skins to make them soft for our needed winter clothing . Mr. Hall unboxed some of his scientific instruments  --  a pendulum , an alidade , and an equatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pendulum , by means of which the attraction of gravity was to be determined at that northern latitude , was swung on steel knife edges and suspended in a box of strong board with a glass door . It had been loaned by the Society , through an arrangement by Mr. Grinnell . Mr. Hall was very particular about it , allowing no one else to go near . There was little chance of any of us harming it , because its workings were incomprehensible to me and Joe and Hannah shunned it because they believed it some kind of evil spirit . The winter wore on ; we labored to make ready for our spring journey to Repulse Bay , and beyond . One day , when the ice had pretty well gone out , I saw a whaler creeping down the sound ; a poor-appearing vessel , with yards askew and needing paint . She was sounding for an anchorage , and a while later she  | dropped her hook . A small boat put out for shore , having seen our tiny settlement and the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow of the boat was a bearded man in a nautical cap . He fended off with a long boat hook , and then sprang nimbly ashore , driving the hook into the snow . " You , there ! " He came up to me , hitching his pants and looking at me from an eye with a cast in it . " What 're you up to , eh ? " I had been drying a net , and took my time in replying . " What does it look like ? " He swore at me and stuck out his unshaven chin . " Do n't get gay with me , laddie , or I 'll take a stick to your breeches ! " " I 'm Adam Burritt , " I said , " of the Hall Expedition to Boothia and King William Land . You 'll find Mr. Hall over there , in that little shelter . " The whaler looked at me and rubbed his nose , finally spitting out a mouthful of tobacco juice near my foot . His brow had such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike there , it would glance olf and go elsewhere to seek lodgment . " All right , " he said . " Fair enough , laddie . " Thumbs hooked in his belt , he swaggered away . The men in the boat pulled it up on the gravelly bank and lit pipes , watching me askance . They were a rough and a foul lot , and being to leeward of them was not pleasant . One put a mouth harp to his lips and played a jig . Another , a lean man in a striped shirt under a dirty sealskin jacket , strolled toward me . Thin-lipped , pale in the face , a kind of a soft-footed way of walking  --  why , it was  --  yes , it must be ! Patrick Coleman , off the old George Henry ! " Well , " he said , " if it ai n't Holy Boy Burritt ! Yes , that 's right . Adam Burritt himself . Still with Crazy Hall ? " I remembered the time I had seen Patrick Coleman on the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two equal parts . But there seemed to be no rancor in him now , be- yond that which was natural to his way , as familiar and unpremeditated as breathing . Besides , I was now some twenty pounds heavier and a great deal broader in the shoulders and chest . " Yes , " I said , " I 'm still with Mr. Hall . Have you any objec-tions ? " He grinned , tongue flicking out to skim his lips ; that odd gesture he had that reminded me of a snake 's forked tongue darting this way and that . " No need to be unfriendly . It might cost you dear , for I 've got something your Mr. Hall might be interested in . " " What could you have that he would want ? " Slyly he took a chamois bag from an inner pocket . " Carried this around with me for better'n a year . Never knew when I might run into that feller Hall . " Opening the bag , he held it high and shook it . A teaspoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ florid engraving . " Here , take it . Look at it . Tell me what you think . " I held it close and examined it . On the stem was some kind of a queer animal , looking like a sea monster done by a man who had never seen one . Around the animal was a fringe of raised tiny bosses . The handle was bent and twisted straight again . The bowl was worn and scratched as if it had seen long service . " Well , " I said , " I do n't see what ? " I broke off , suddenly knowing what the sea monster was . It was an eel . The eel was always prominent in Sir John Franklin 's life . His crest bore the eel  --  the flag on the Erebus , the lost Erebus , had been the eel flag . Now here was a piece of Sir John Franklin 's silver ; battered and scratched , and hardly serviceable . But there was no doubt about it ; the sign of the eel ! " Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable and worried while I scanned the piece , suddenly looked happier , more sure of himself . " Now would n't you like to know ! "  | " Of course I would ! You know what this is , or you would n't have brought it to me . This spoon is one of Sir John Franklin 's ! Where did you find it ? " " I did n't find it myself . I traded one of these gecks a cloth coat and a pound of tobacco for it . But he told me where he found it , and that 's what 's important , ai n't it ? " " All right , " I said . " We 'll make it up to you . But tell me ? " He snatched the spoon away and put it back in the chamois bag . " I knew it was valuable . But I ai n't dealing with a common seaman . I 'll talk to your precious Mr. Hall about this , see what he 's willing to pay for the story that goes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He leered at me and winked . " There 's always money for something a man needs bad enough . " The whaling skipper came out of Mr. Hall 's hut , followed by Mr. Hall . They were deep in conversation as they walked toward us , and some acrimony seemed to be involved , because I could hear anger in their voices . Patrick Coleman seemed apprehensive , also , because he took me by the sleeve and whispered into my ear . " He 's a tough one , Captain Burden . As soon cut your throat as look at you . Do n't say nothing to him about the spoon , Adam , or he 'll want in on the deal himself . " " All right . " " Good . " Coleman heaved a sigh of relief . " They 're planning on laying to for a few days and careening the Jessie . She 's got a sprung plank forward and 's been shipping water . Just sit tight , mate , and I 'll drop in soon and see your shipmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But take care of yourself . Do n't get your throat cut before you tell Mr. Hall your story . "  | WE watched the unpleasant Captain Burden and his men row away in their boat . When they were well out from the beach , Mr. Hall snorted . " Alcohol , that is what they wanted ! Strong drink , rum , anything of that nature ! They were out of liquor , and seeing our camp , decided we could supply their wants ! " Except for a little port for the stomach 's sake , and champagne on such occasions as our party in the Gibbs House , Mr. Hall eschewed liquor ; not on any moral base , but simply because he felt it fogged the mind and affected the judgment . " At first , " he said , " not knowing exactly what they were after , I made the mistake of telling them we had a bottle of alcohol in reserve for some of our scientific instruments . That , I see now , was a mistake . Captain Burden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding it . " " They may be back , " I said . " I understand they are going tO  | be in the vicinity for a while , careening ship to repair some damaged planking . " " Did you learn anything else from them ? As we came toward the beach I saw you talking to one of the scoundrels . " " That was Patrick Coleman , " I explained . " You remember Coleman , off the George Henry . He was the one who beat poor Kudlago and was probably the cause of his death . " Mr. Hall 's eyes became somber at the mention of Kudlago . " Aye , I remember , well enough . And you and Coleman had an altercation with a blubber spade one day . " I told him about the eel-pattern spoon , and Coleman 's offer to sell it and information concerning its finding , for a price . Mr. Hall was delighted . " The eel , of course ! Adam , do you know what this means ? Perhaps I am on the verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew suddenly sober and calculating . " How much does Ile want for it ? " " I do n't know , " I said , " but from the way he talked about it , he thinks it 's very valuable , and will want a great deal . " He tugged at his beard , looking at me . " You know our financial position as well as I do . We have few dollars , a very few . I could not afford much . " " Sir , " I said , " I have known Patrick Coleman for a long time . Longer , perhaps , and under more intimate circumstances , than have you . Coleman is a liar and a cheat . I would not trust him very far . He has this spoon , as he says . The important thing is where it was picked up . I am not sure Coleman even knows where it first came from . Knowing your great interest in the Franklin matter , I would not put it past him to make up some unlikely story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had valuable information . " Mr. Hall sat down on a rock , looking at the Jessie . " I doubt it , Adam . After all  --  why , I mean  --  in a matter of this kind how could any man so far forget his humanity as to lie ? Even the vilest blackguard would , I think , hesitate to hinder our search ! "  | Sometimes I despaired of him . With all his great abilities , he was often naive and guileless . " Besides , " I insisted , " you have made your plans . King William Land is where you are bound for . From examining all the data available , you told the gentlemen of the Society that King William Land is where the fate of the Franklin party could be settled for once and for all . " I remembered what Mr. Grinnell had said to me on Merrill 's wharf that last day , so many months ago . Speak up to him , be his conscience and his friend . Will you do that , for him  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is it wise , I asked , " to turn aside so soon , and go looking in a different direction ? " We had never quarreled before , and there had always been a good and friendly relationship between us . Now , in the rising pitch of his voice and the well-remembered scowl , I detected signs of anger . " Yes , that is right ! I said so , and that was my position at the time , the best position that the facts supported . But the spoon is new and important evidence ! " " I do not trust Patrick Coleman . " I tried hard to keep my manner objective , not wanting to anger him , but in duty bound to point out the facts as they were known to me . " He is a liar and a cheat . Sir , your purpose is too high to be turned aside by a rascal only out to line his pockets . " Mr. Hall 's weathered face reddened . " I was not born yesterday , Adam . What I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that spoon ! I myself , and none other , will decide if the story of the spoon is a reliable and reasonable one . If a promising clue should be presented , I care not who presents it . Liar and cheat he may be , but I have traveled this Arctic country for some years in my search , and I will go wherever the spoon points , if I think it a good idea . " There was no point in arguing with him . I saw the familiar set of his chin , the tugging at the beard  --  besides , what did I  | know about the matter ? Perhaps he was right ; Coleman might be in a position to shed light on our quest . " Yes , sir . " I turned away , and went to mending a tear in our net . For a while Mr. Hall paced up and down the shingle of the beach , pausing once only to stare at me and ponder , though I was too angry and too proud to do anything but be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands clasped behind his back . I was sorry and thought of calling after him to make amends , but the Burritts were never known as diplomats . I let him go , and finished my mending of the net . Afterwards , dispirited , I went into Joe 's tupik to talk with Hannah , the alwaysunderstanding Hannah . " Why are you angry , Adam ? " was the first thing she asked , biting at a thread . In my distraught condition , sitting on the sharp edge of my emotions , the question , directly phrased in her clipped British syllables , struck me as funny . I looked around me at the welter of articles in the tiny tent . A proper lady , so demure and feminine , in a gingham pinafore over the koo-lee-tang ; yet all about were uncleanliness and confusion . The skin floor of the tupik was littered with uneatable flesh , skins , blood and bones . Hanging over a low flame the customary stone kettle , black with soot and oil , bubbled with black meat , swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrapings of a butcher 's stall . Yet Hannah sewed with a steel needle , and near her lay a copy of Leslie 's Illustrated Weekly , which she used to practice her English reading . " I am not angry , " I said . " But you are . " Now pregnant with another child , Hannah was sweetly radiant . " What has happened , Adam ? " " Mr. Hall and I have disagreed , that is all . " Her fingers flashed as she sewed in and out , bending over her work . " That is too bad . But these things happen . I am some- times angry at my Joe , whom I love more than me . It is all right . Do not feel bad . " Squatting beside her , I envied her unfailing good humor . " There is took-too in the kettle , " she said . " Eat . It is good . " There was indeed reindeer meat in the pot ; a pot-au-feu of heads and necks , boiled in the blood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste dropping it on the floor . Shaking off the debris I started to gnaw on it . What strange chance had brought me to eat such unlikely provender ? The Lord , if He took any real account of Adam Burritt , moved in very mysterious ways . " I am happy , " Hannah said . Still squatting in the way they did , she wriggled over beside me and touched my cheek . " Poor Adam , are you not happy too to be away from those big cities down there ? " She pointed , taking in New York and Boston and New London and all those rabbit warrens in a scornful gesture . " Too many people ! They are crowded up and you can not get your breath . " " Well , " I said , gnawing on a neck bone , " it is not bad if you are used to it . " " But who would want to get used to it ? " She laughed , shaking her head . " Who would want to get used to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trailing thread and spat out the end . " You know the story about the kod-lu-na ; how the Great Being tried to make a man one day ? " I had heard it many times . It was an old story , common to many civilizations . " He tried very hard , but could not make a good one . Finally , when he had done the best he could , he called it kod-lu-na . But the next day , when he felt better and had the knack of it , he tried again and made a better one . " " I know , " I grumbled . " That was your people . " She stared at me , puzzled . A tear started in her eye . Throwing the sewing from her , she bent her head and wept . " I did n't mean to offend you , " I said . " That is a very funny story , I think , and maybe it is right . Really , Hannah , I ? "  | Now she was laughing ; unaccountably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam , it is so funny ! " " What is funny ? " I demanded , completely confused . " I did not think about you being a kod-lu-na ! " My dignity was injured . " I do n't think it very funny . " " Adam , " said this remarkable lady , patting me on the knee , " I am truly sorry . But it is really a nice thing I said to you ; one of the best things I could say to anyone . You , Adam Burritt , are one of us . I am proud to say it . There , now  --  is that so bad ? " " Hannah , " I said , " thank you . Thank you very much . " Outside , the long day was dying . Saffron streamers veiled high in the sky , lit from below by the waning sun . Birds called ; in the sound a fish jumped , and the circles grew and grew from that point in the water . Mosquitoes hung in the air , and the careened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spars pointing like blackened fingers . Aboard her a yellow lamp went on , an eye in the dusk . I wonder , I said to myself , why you are here , Adam Burritt ! A filthy skin tupik , no money  --  Mr. Hall did not pay me , except for my keep , had never spoken of repaying the money from my lay which he borrowed  --  supper of boiled reindeer heads , bitten by mosquitoes , newly at odds with my mentor ; it was too much to understand , my being here . Then suddenly I knew . I was in love with the Arctic . I was here because I wanted to be . I would never want to be anyplace else . I went to bed feeling very good , and comforted . Perhaps my love for this land was not so grand and ecstatic as Mr. Hall 's , but it was no less strong . One day Patrick Coleman came to us , as I knew he would . Captain Burden had sent ashore a party to fill casks with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall watched them land , not saying anything . After a while there was a crashing in the underbrush . Coleman burst out , panting for breath , hands and face scratched and bleeding .  | " Where 's Hall ? " I pointed , and Coleman hurried toward him . " Ai n't got much time , " he called over his shoulder . " They 'll miss me before long . " When I came up on them Coleman was arguing and gesticulating . I squatted nearby , not too near , but at hand if there was any need . I still did not trust him . " But it 's worth a hundred dollars or more ! " Mr. Hall 's eyes shone as he examined the teaspoon . He held it up and said , " Look , Adam ! The eel spoon ! " " I know . I have seen it . " " I have n't got a hundred dollars , " Mr. Hall explained . " I am almost penniless . I do n't know where you got the idea , Coleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold coins . But I must know where you got this ! I can not impress on you how important the facts are . They may mean life to some hundred or so poor souls ! " " All I know , " said Coleman sulkily , snatching away the spoon , " is it 's worth money to you . If you want the story that goes with it , you must pay the piper . " He looked over his shoulder into the brushy growth . " There now  --  I hear the whistle ! I 'll have to be going back . It 's your last chance ! The Jessie 's most fixed up . The cap'n ' 11 be taking her out again in a few days . " " I must have it , " Mr. Hall said stubbornly , reaching into his pocket . " Do n't try no monkey business ! " Coleman drew the knife from his sleeve and looked from one of us to the other . " I was n't thinking of that . " Mr. Hall brought out a scrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing on , to enter later in his bound journal . " Look , man , will you take a note ? " Coleman laughed a shrill laugh . " A note , is it ? Payable on the Bank of the Wager River ? " " Payable by me , when we get back to the States ! Adam here shall be my witness . "  | Coleman blinked , and wiped his nose with the back of his hand . " No tricks ? " " You have my word of honor . And Adam 's too . " I did n't see how this involved me , but I said , " That 's right . " " I do n't know you very well , " Coleman said to Mr. Hall , " but I know Adam here , and I trust him . I do n't like him , but I trust him . But a note 's different from cash on the drumhead ! It 'll cost you more . T'wo hundred dollars . " Mr. Hall was dumfounded . " Two hundred dollars ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " this is extortion . Do n't ? " " Two hundred ai n't much , considering all those people involved , " Coleman whined . " I give a pound of tobacco for the information , and I 'm running short on smokes already ! " " You 're a damned scoundrel , but I have no choice , " Mr. Hall said fiercely . He grabbed the chamois sack from Coleman and scribbled out a note . " Ilere , Adam . " He handed me the paper and a stub of pencil . " Sign there , as witness . " I was not sure I ought , but I did . " Now , " said Mr. Hail , " where did the spoon come from ? " " From Igloolik , " said Coleman . " I sneaked a look at one of Captain Burden 's charts . It 's up by what they call the Straits of Fury and Hecla . This geck said they was more stuff there , too ; pots and pans , and the old men in Igloolik remembered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they called him  --  a big man with gray hair and spectacles . " " Sir John ! " Mr. Hall burst out . " Franklin himself ! " " There was a pile of rocks , " Coleman said , " and some papers . " The shrill bleat of the whistle sounded again , nearer this time . " That 's all I know ! " Coleman said in sudden panic . Before either of us could raise a hand , he bounded away like a hare and disappeared in the thicket . " Igloolik , " said Mr. Hall . He put the spoon back in the sack . " I think the story hangs together . " Talking almost to himself ,  | he walked away to his tent . " There is not much time . I must prepare for a journey at once . " " Yes , sir , " I said , following in his footsteps . I do not think he heard me at all . We went to Igloolik . At least , we started for there . Igloolik , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships of Sir William Edward Parry , the explorer ) , was three hundred miles north of our camp . The season was too late for sledge travel . Our only route appeared to be northward by boat via the ice-choked Foxe Basin . It would be a rough trip . " Adam , " said Mr. Hall , " do you trust our party to voyage so far in the boat you and Joe have built ? " In the excitement of the forthcoming voyage he was in good spirits again , forgetting our angry words . " Yes , sir , " I said . " The Lady Franklin is a good boat . I will trust her anyplace . " The Lady Franklin ( which is what Mr. Hall had named her ) was stoutly fashioned of white oak ; twenty-eight feet long , a five foot , ten inch beam , and drawing about twenty-six inches , fully loaded with our supplies . The supplies were considerable , and our party even more so . Although the Lady Franklin had a sail stepped on a short mast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy boat , low in the water , required a considerable crew . As a corollary , the crew required considerable supplies . When we left , we looked like a queer kind of ark departing Mount Ararat . Some hundredweight of dried meat and biscuit , Mr. Hall 's scientific instruments , our guns and powder and ball , bladders of fresh water , a fishing net , maps and charts ; in addition to all this were Joe and Hannah , their friend , fat Pikeula , and his wife Artoona , their son-in-law Koklee and his cousin , whose Esquimaux name I do not recall but who was known as Casey , after a whaler he had once befriended . Then there was Nartuk , the an-ge-ko , a withered little man with a face like a dried-up plum whom neither Mr. Hall nor I trusted , but  | whom Artoona and Pikeula revered . Mr. Hall and I completed the party  --  nine souls in this frail cockleshell , loaded to the gunwales with our freight ! We would have been satisfied to travel with a lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring these northern latitudes . One was forced to depend on the Esquimaux for so many things ; to row the boat when the wind failed , to serve as guides and hunters , to interpret when meeting other Esquimaux who did not speak the lingua franca of the North , the Innuit tongue . In addition , the Esquimaux were expert map makers , and Mr. Hall depended much on them in his surveying . Also , in these far northern latitudes about which so little was known , there was the chance of encountering unfriendly natives . In our numbers there was strength against such a possibility . So off we bowled , practically a convention , into Foxe Basin against a stiff northerly . Mr. Hall was at the rudder . He said to me , beard fluttering in the wind , " Northward again , eh , Adam ? Always northward ! It is a fine and familiar direction , one of the best . When I am bound in that direction all cares drop away from me . " Already we had been forced to bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old bucket , laughing and joking with Artoona , who sat in the waist on a sack of our dried toodnoo . Joe handled the sheet and Hannah squatted next him , reading from the Bible Mr. Hall had given her . " Give me a northerly course any time . There is something lackadaisical about steering south . East and west  --  what are they ? Merely points on the compass card . But north is the prime direction , I think . " " Northward , then , we go ! " I said . " A tee ! " called Joe . " Good ! " There was a chorus of atee all around , and it was plain we were in agreement . The Foxe Basin was filled with great bergs . We tacked in and out among them , moving handsomely , Mr. Hall handling  | the rudder and calling instructions to Joe . He was very good at small boats ; another skill he had learned for the most part from books , and from secondhand information received from others in preparation for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome bergs loom up , tower over us , and then slide away aft . One seemed like the ruins of a lofty dome about to fall , a portion of its arched roof already tumbling down . As I watched , a great ledge came undone and slid slowly into the water , raising a cloud of spray and ice . The cold breath of the dying berg rolled over us and we all shivered , hanging on the gunwales as the waves occasioned by the fall rocked our boat . Another great berg , around which Mr. Hall expertly maneuvered us , looked like a monstrous elephant with two large circular towers on its back , Corinthian spires springing out from the rubble of alabaster in which it stood . As we left it astern and saw it from another angle , it resembled a lighthouse atop highpiled rocks , all whiter than drifted snow . I was giddy at this great spectacle and clutched the gunwale , having a momentary vertigo . The Esquimaux , too , were impressed . In their small ki-as , knowing the treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often venture thus near them . Old Nartuk , the an-ge-ko , started a chant , and the rest broke into flutelike whistlings , which was their custom . The sound was weird and otherworldly against the background of high-flung spray and the sighing of the winds through the lonely ice castles . I was glad when the late dusk came and we went ashore for the night . We pitched our tupiks on the gravelly beach . Hannah and Artoona soon had tea going and cooked a stew of dried meat . The evening sky was filled with high-piled clouds , ripped with gold and red , underlaid with a long gray bank , like mother-ofpearl in the way it caught and held the rays of the sun . Ducks fed offshore , bobbing and diving for fish among the floating bergs . It was a scene of pastoral simplicity and peace , but it was not to remain so . Almost immediately after supper , old Nartuk decided to start his an-koo-ting . For the rest of the night he and  | the Esquimaux kept at it , hooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of his tent , where he had been working on his surveying tables and maps by the light of an oil lamp . " I ought to stop them , " he said . " We will have a hard day of it tomorrow , with the ice as thick as it is . They will need their strength at the oars . " I nodded , watching the figures capering in the firelight . " Hannah is soon to have her baby . It can not be good for her to be dancing so . " I knew them well , the Esquimaux , and liked them , understanding if not approving many of their customs . But this business of the an-koo-ting was one I had never been able to stomach . It was too wild , too animal-like . Old Nartuk , jealous of Father Hall 's influence on his people , stood in the firelight gesturing , speaking in a hoarse and strenuous voice . Surrounding him , arms linked , the rest swayed back and forth in a shuffling dance . Some whistled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut tight and sweat rolling down their faces . From time to time Joe or Koklee or one of the men would shout , " Atee ! Atee ! Good ! Go on ! " I never knew what the an-ge-ko was saying . Although both Mr. Hall and I spoke Innuit and some of its variations , he better than I , neither of us was ever able to make much out of an an-ge-lo 's harangue . Perhaps it was a special dialect , saved for these occasions . At any rate , it had a powerful effect on his hearers . They were mesmerized , seeming almost to sleep and yet high-strung and trembling , in a kind of spell . It would have been dangerous to cross them during these fits ; even Joe and Hannah , who were devoted to Mr. Hall . Now , I think , the shrunk-faced Nartuk had them in even a nastier mood . I do not doubt he was working them up against Mr. Hall . " This will not do ! " Mr. Hall laid down his notebook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You and Koklee ? Joe  --  Hannah ? "  | Nartuk rushed toward him screaming some malediction . He had been thumping on the key-low-tik , a bone hoop over which was stretched a piece of deerskin . He shook it in the air , his fingers thrumming it , and called out in the strange tongue . The dancers broke their circle and looked at each other and at us in a dazed way . " Stop this ! " Mr. Hall said sternly . He looked at Joe and at Hannah particularly . " I forbid this  --  this excess , or whatever it is ! We have a busy day ahead of us tomorrow , and it is time for you all to go to bed and sleep . Do you hear me ? " I am a Christian , or try to be , and so do not believe in evil spirits or spells . But there was such an atmosphere of evil in the firelight that I drew back . Not conscious evil , perhaps ; Joe and Hannah and Casey and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any civilization , however different from our own . But on this summer night they were in the grasp of something inexplicable and sad . Against their own wishes , against their own decencies , they had been caught up by the expert Nartuk in a weird revel , black and bitter and permeated with evil . " We just dance , " Hannah said in a forlorn voice . " We do not do any harm . " Mr. Hall was patient . " I did not say you were doing harm , any of you . It is just that it is very late , and I shall need all of you in the morning ! Go to sleep , all of you , and rest . " They went away in ones and twos , straggling and slow as if to express defiance , looking back over their shoulders and whispering among themselves . Old Nartuk remained by the fire , thumping softly on the key-low-tik , eyes closed , oblivious to us . But I knew enough about Nartuk to know that he thought himself mightily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that it was foolish of me to interfere . But one man must have the say . And I say it is better for them to go to bed and leave off this heathenish shouting and dancing . "  | He turned and went back to his tent , leaving Nartuk still shuffling his feet and strumming the key-low-tik . I did not like the feeling of being alone on the grassy hummock with the ange-ko . I went into the tupik also , and rolled myself in my blankets . The last thing I remembered was the shadow of Mr. Hall , magnified on the wall of the tupik , as he worked at his figures . That was only the beginning of our misfortunes that summer . We struggled on and on ; the perverse ice became ever thicker as we tacked northward . This late in the summer we had every right to expect Foxe Basin to be free of ice , but it stretched before us , blinking a dazzle into our eyes , blinding white in the sun , only too ready to crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds buffeted us , each hour 's sailing meant another hour in patching ripped sails . While to Mr. Hall the difficult ies tolled a knell for his hopes to reach the Straits of Fury and Hccla that summer , to our Esquimaux companions the whole affair was a glorious lark . Spurred on by the jealous Nartuk , they became wild and irresponsible . Seeing a seal lying on a floating ice cake , they would disregard Mr. Hall completely in their eagerness for the hunt . Letting the sail drop they would all seize an oar , paddling as they did their ki-as , laughing and shouting in excitement . It did not matter if bellies were full of seal meat from the noonday meal ; no matter , they paddled away on a silly hunt for a seal we did not need , and became vicious and unco-operative if balked . Even Hannah , the mild and ladylike Hannah , was infected with this queer fever . I think it was the tonic effect the summer had on them , as I have heard it has its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ) pent up by the snows of winter . " I do not understand you , " I said sulkily to Hannah . " For a while I thought you were a perfect lady , and a very civilized person . Now I do not know what to think . " " Why do you bother to think at all ? " she exclaimed . " It is not good to think so much , Adam . Do not be so eternally stuffy !  | There is not always a right and a wrong . Do what the heart says , always ; that is the only good way . " Perhaps it was not so bad for her to be happy because a grief was soon to come on her . Near Point Elizabeth Hannah 's baby was born , and it was almost immediately apparent that it was not to live long . Not deformed , that is , but somehow listless and never crying , the way a healthy baby does . For a week or more Hannah sat in the stern with the blanket-wrapped bundle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the rest of us fought the perverse northerly winds and saw the unseasonable ice grow thicker and ever thicker . In only a short time , I knew , we would be forced to turn back . We would not reach the Straits this year . One night the baby became worse , growing dark and flushed in the face , while the body writhed and the eyes turned up in the sockets . We put ashore none too soon . A blinding snowstorm whirled down from the north , lashing the open water into foam , shrieking around the bergs . Mr. Hall and I huddled in the tupik we shared , while Hannah and Joe and the baby shared the one next . Mr. Hall sipped his tea and wrote in his journal . After a while he read back what he had written . " How cheerless is our tupik ! The moss wick of our lamp , which ( when we have our full supply of blubber ) gives a continuity of flame of two feet six inches , is narrowed down to a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total darkness . Long and cast-down faces are now faintly seen , that otherwise would be veiled from us . Our huts are sad , our voices almost hushed . But away , away , thou Fiend of Despair ! This is no home for you . We are the children of Hope , Prayer , and Work . God is our Father , and better times will come . " He had medicines which he tried to get Hannah to give the baby , but she stubbornly would not have them , putting her faith instead in Nartuk . Pleased at her trust and relishing his victory over Father Hall , the an-ge-ko went through a long cere- mony ( for which Joe paid an ax ) to determine whether the baby would live or die . I did not blame poor Hannah . Being presented to Queen Victoria did not make a Christian out of a poor Innuit woman , nor did her gingham pinafore . She put her faith in the greatest influence she knew , as we all do in time of trouble . No one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience as we all squeezed into the small tent to watch . First , he made Joe lie down on a bed of skins and put a leather strap around Joe 's brow , all the time whistling and humming to himself . When all was set , Nartuk pulled up on the leather strap . This , he explained , told him the answers to the questions he was about to ask . If Joe 's head came up readily , the answer was " yes . " If Joe 's head remained firmly down , the answer was " no . " For almost a week we remained at Point Elizabeth going through this mumbo-jumbo , Nartuk enjoying the center of the stage . After exhausting the baby 's father with his head lifting and dropping , and amassing a great quantity of " yes " and " no " answers that did not seem to prove anything , he started on Pikeula . After Pikeula came Casey , and then Koklee , and then he started on the women ; Artoona and Hannah herself . Would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Had Hannah somehow put a curse on the child by adopting too many of the kod-lu-na 's customs ? If Hannah were to give up tea , would this help ? Was it not dangerous to the child to keep on going north , the way Mr. Hall wanted to do ? The Esquimaux lay respectfully on the ground in the tupik , all of them puzzled but trying to help , bobbing their heads up and down while Nartuk giggled and put his finger in his mouth and stared at Mr. Hall with malevolence in his gaze . It was only too plain ; the an-ge-ko was using the situation for his own ends . I was ready to thrash him , evil spirits or no . " The devil ! " muttered Mr. Hall . " If he does not come to some conclusion by tomorrow , I will force some of my calomel on the baby . It can do no harm , and may save the child ! "  | Fortunately , or perhaps not , the end came suddenly . There was no need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was an end to it . Hannah rushed out of the tupik , the lifeless body clasped to her bosom . Leaving the tupik so quickly was , I remembered , Innuit custom . If this is not done when anyone dies in it , everything becomes worthless . In this case , it was felt that the bereaved mother went out soon enough so the bedding and everything else did not have to be thrown away . " Poor woman , " Mr. Hall said . " I have failed her , I think . " In ten minutes she returned and took her seat on the bed platform , very pale and composed . She allowed Artoona to take the dead baby from her bosom to be wrapped in a small furry took-too skin . Nartuk , very officious , insisted that the child be buried at once , but in response to Hannah 's piteous wailing , Mr. Hall faced down the old man . The child was not buried until the next day , after we had sat with it through the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived long enough to have a name . At one in the afternoon the tiny corpse was bound with a leathern thong , making a loop that fitted over Hannah 's neck , for it was part of the rites that the mother carry the body to the burial place . Although it seemed like an unnecessary mutilation of a good tupik , a hole had to be cut in the back of the tent and the burial procession crawled out that way . To leave by the front flap was unlucky . We buried the baby in a rock cairn some distance from the beach . I stood on one side of Hannah , holding her hand , and Joe on the other . Mr. Hall , at her request , read from the Bible over the small body . " If I listen to Father Hall , " she sobbed , " my baby not dead . Adam , I have been bad , very bad , and I am punished now . " After the services were over we wended our way down the hill and got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sky was leaden and gray , and a chill was in the north wind . Winter storms were not far away . When we had knocked down  | our tupik and stored our supplies again in the Lady Franklin , Mr. Hall took the eel-crest spoon out of his pocket and looked at it . " Not this time , " he said . " Ah well , there is no cure for it , I am afraid . " He wrapped it up in the cloth that he always carried around it , and put it back in an inner pocket . " Next year , " he said . " For sure , eh , Adam ? "  | WHEN I came back to the Arctic on the Monticello , I had not reckoned on being in that icy country for so many years . But it was so . Delay after delay , trouble after trouble ; they plagued us in unending succession . Mr. Hall 's old trouble ( the thickening of the blood ) came back on him , and he was ill through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was in hopes of mounting a sledge expedition to the Straits ( although it was a dangerous time of the year for a sledge journey ) , sickness struck the Esquimaux dogs of the area , wiping out three-quarters of them , including our own noble Barbekark . It was a queer and vicious disease that ran like wildfire . First , there was a telltale restlessness and a slavering . If not chained , the dog ran wildly about barking and whining , unable to understand the nature of its feelings . In the final stages the dog fell on its side , unable to rise , coughing and pawing at mouth and jaws . Too weak to move , the poor beast died in the  | snow . Around about us , and in the villages , were dozens of the unfortunate animals , frozen into grotesque positions , dead of the mysterious blight . There was nothing to do with them but let them lie until the spring thaws and the heat of the sun should destroy them . Croton oil and solution of morphia did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbekark as intently and faithfully as ever a physician did a mortal patient . The treatment did not help . Barby stiffened and died , and Hannah and Mr. Hall were in tears as the gallant beast breathed his last . " Poor fellow , " said Mr. Hall . " He was like one of us , really . " That winter the ice in the bay " sang " with the pressure of the storm-driven waters beneath it . Word reached us that people at Ningook village , fifty miles west of us , had died of starvation , not being able to hunt for the bad weather , and not having put by the dried took-too meat which they should have done . The Esquirnaux were a curious and improvident people , never foreseeing trouble , only too ready to live off the charity of the whalers ; the old fable of the ant and the grasshopper . Hannah and Joe , although somewhat civilized , still exhibited this same improvidence . That winter , when it was drawing on toward spring , the goodhearted Joe decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in short supplies , living off dried meat which we had laid by in preparation for the sledge journey , they nevertheless planned a party , inviting the neighbors for miles around , including old Nartuk . The big igloo Joe had built for the occasion was crowded with guests ; forty or fifty people were crowded within its icy walls . Joe was there , and Hannah , Mr. Hall and I , Nartuk , Pikeula , Artoona , Armou , Nukerzou , Ouela , Neitchi , and dozens of others whom I did n't know . A one-eyed small girl whom Mr. Hall gladdened by giving her a comb for her unkempt hair ; a distant relative of fat Pikeula with a nose eaten away by some disease , but merry and joking withal ; two silent and bony uncles of Artoona who sat glumly in a corner and ate our ship 's biscuit  | with alarming speed . Food was the principal attraction at an Esquirnaux party . As standards went in that country , our bill of fare was not bad . Pemmican soup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats , isinglass jelly , sea bread with coffee from our meager supply . The men ate first , as was the custom . The women cleaned up the scraps and licked the pot , meantime stuffing the children to suffocation . To secure the maximum benefit , everyone scraped the grease from his mouth and cheeks and licked his fingers , belching contentedly . Afterwards there was dancing , and playing on the key-low-tik . The women took an active part , and many of them were quite attractive , or so began to seem . They were gaily dressed , wearing on each side of the face an enormous pigtail constructed by wrapping the black hair on a wooden pin a foot or so in length , strips of reindeer fur being wrapped with the hair . Shining ornaments were worn on the head , and the picture in the flickering lamplight was a pleasing one . Mr. Hall threw away a gnawed bone and got to his knees . " ' Twa drifted heaps , sae fair to see . . . ' " he murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it is late and I am going to bed . In this howling mob I will not be missed . " He signed to Joe and Hannah , and before they could remonstrate , slipped out into the night . I stayed for a while longer , enjoying the rough horseplay and the singing and dancing , but when they all fell again to an-kooting , with Nartuk ascending the pulpit , I decided to go to bed also . Outside , I breathed deep of the frozen night air , only then realizing that I had been half-suffocated in the igloo , taking into my lungs that foul atmosphere of seal oil , smoke , and human sweat . Mr. Hall was standing near , lost in an attitude of thought , gazing into the moonlit waste . I did not know how long he had been there , but by my estimate he had left the igloo an hour before .  | " Sir ! " I said . " You will be ill , standing here this way ! Go inside , I beg you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not seem to hear me , and stood motionless . Then he threw off the hood of his koo-lee-tang and said in an astonished voice , " Eh ? Who is there ? " " It 's me . Adam . " He raised a hand to his brow and rubbed it . " I had lost track of time , I think . " Pointing toward the low-dipping Pole Star he said , " Think of it , Adam ; up there , in its lonely grandeur ! The Holy Grail , almost , in isolation and unattainability . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , the Pole , of course ! " He took a deep breath , and clouds of frost exhaled from his lips . " The North Pole itself ! Such a small space from us  --  only lying beneath that star  --  and here am I , balked from it . But someday I will stand on it , Adam . On it , do you hear ? I can not be stopped . 1 will not be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were feeling ill again and thought it best to change the subject . " When we left New London , Mr. Grinnell spoke to me of a theory you had on the use of balloons in the Arctic . I have been meaning to ask you ? " " Balloons ? " He pondered . " Yes , perhaps . You read in the newspapers of Professor Lowe and his balloon ascents over the Union lines in the war . Well , that is one reason this great white land is so important . Until now I have not said much about it , but listen ! " He seized my arm . " Up there , directly over the Pole , is the shortest route from New York to India ! We already have the steam engine , we have the aerial balloon  --  why not , someday , a fleet of aerial vessels sailing over the Pole itself , bound on errands of commerce ? Eh ? " In his enthusiasm he shook me , forgetting my own slightness of stature compared to his bearlike dimensions . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back to the tupik , I took his hand and pulled him along the path after me . " But for now ? "  | " Eh ? " He peered at me . " Or do you also think me a fool ? " " I think , " I said , " you have eaten something that did not agree very well with you . Remember , you have been ill . " He seemed disappointed and scowled , but went along with me . Balloons ! I thought . Good Lord , what next ? As spring came again , our chances faded for a voyage to the Straits . A boat journey was impracticable through the icechoked Foxe Basin , and it was too late for a sledge trip . Besides , Mr. Hall vowed he would never again attempt such a trip with an Esquimaux crew . Perhaps when whalers came into our bay again in the summer , we might find some malcontents who would risk a trip . But the castoffs from the whalers were not apt to be fit travelers or fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his plans and the sorry end they had come to . He would sit for hours looking at the battered silver of the Franklin spoon , his only sign of life an occasional sigh . Exploring was his life ; now that he was limited to local surveying and the keeping of his daily journal and the entering into it of weather data and the barometric pressure , he was dispirited . With the advent of summer many whalers came into our bay . There was the True Love , which I remembered from Kowtukjua , long ago ; also the George Kimberly and the Hand of Friendship and the John P. Casey . Joe and I kept busy netting and drying fish , making pemmican , mashing the berry the Esquimaux called tin-noot into a paste that dried in the sun , making a palatable tart stuff that was good for the scurvy . In addition , we undertook some whaling with the Lady Franklin , the boat I had built in New London . The whalers paid us fifty dollars each for whales towed to their " stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order of credit against them for molasses , flour , meal , matches , or other staples . We had forgot the color of money , having had so little of it for so long . Besides , it was not of much use in this land . Everything was bartered for , even children . Most of the Esquimaux families had extra children . Girl  | babies , particularly , were in excess and were often even given away , if not left to perish in an isolated igloo . The Esquimaux character was always a puzzle to me . Happy people , affectionate , appearing to love their offspring , a man might suddenly fall in a mood and trade off two or three of them for an old shotgun and a can of powder . The homely routine of summer went on without incident . Joe and I worked hard , Hannah sewed winter garments , Mr. Hall wrote endlessly in his journal and took long walks into the mountains . And one day , beaching the Lady Franklin in a cove some distance from our camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rib cage of a flesh-stripped skeleton , making a splintering and crushing sound . For an instant I stared down at the eyeless sockets of the skull , still plastered with a few strands of dead hair . Shreds of clothing clung to the bony structure , and the boots were whole and sound . " Joe ! " I called . Disturbed at something in my voice , Joe came running . He stood beside me looking down at the remnants of the man . Then soundlessly he pointed at a hole in the skull . It was a big hole , perhaps the size made by a bullet , and a network of small radial cracks surrounded it . " Shoot him , " Joe said in a trembling voice . Dead people were ritually unclean to the Esquimaux . " Someone shoot him ! There , in head . " I did not feel much better about it than Joe , but I knelt and examined the bones . It was not too bad . Stripped of its flesh , a man 's body is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the flesh that carries the significance ; the life , the pulsation of the blood , the look of the face , the spirit , perhaps even the soul itself . " An old woolen coat , and sea boots . " I touched the leathern belt and examined the buckle , covered with verdigris but otherwise sound . Patrick Coleman ? He had been in fear of his life when last I saw him . " Who do you suppose it is  --  was ? "  | " Dead , him . " Joe shuddered . " We go away , you and me , eh , Adam ? " " Wait a minute . " I fingered a shred of what had been a shirt . Striped , it looked like ; maybe red and white , though the reddish cast might have been blood . " Do you remember Patrick Cole-man ? " Joe 's brown face was pale . " You leave ' lone , Adam . Him dead . " " I know he 's dead . But I 'm trying to recollect whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wearing a red and white shirt that day he rowed in from the Jessie , the day he brought the spoon ? " " Could be Coleman . Same size , all right , you bet . Now come away , Adam . No good , no good ! " Entreatingly Joe pulled at my arm . Coleman ? It could be . I seemed to remember that shirt . But there was no way to be sure . And in this uncharted country , a life more or less was of little consequence ; lost overboard , with a scribbled entry in the ship 's log for a headboard . Or perhaps died of scurvy , which was frequent enough . " You come ' long me ! " Joe begged , his face such an exercise in panic that I threw stones and handfuls of earth over the remains and followed him back to the Lady Franklin . Coleman ? I thought it was . Coleman the villain , come to a villainous end . A man may live all his life in a great city , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arctic no such deception is possible . Alone much of the time , enduring hardship , starvation , and great natural forces , what a man is comes out . Then he knows , and others know , too . After five years in the high latitudes , I was beginning to know myself , as well as Mr. Charles Hall . My knowledge of him , as well as that of myself , burst out one day in a way that separated us for a short span of time , only to reunite us more firmly than ever . Hannah , that admirable lady , was visibly pining away before  | our eyes . She grieved for her lost baby , which she had given birth to on that unfortunate attempt to reach Fury and Hecla . Too conscientious to complain , the poor woman drove herself on , furtively wiping away a tear when she thought no one watched . Her fresh gingham pinafore hung on her in loose folds , and her usually merry face became distraught and sallow . We all knew her grief and sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden alone . Finally Mr. Hall , despairing of any other solution , traded one of our two precious sledges for a girl-child ; a sweet-faced little thing of two or three years . " Pun-na , they called her , " Mr. Hall said . He closed his ledger with a bang and got up , rubbing his hands together in a satisfied way . " Ah , Adam , it warmed my heart to see them together ! Hannah was transported with joy . " Not noticing my discomfiture , he walked to the flap of our summer tupik and threw it open . I could hear Ilannah 's voice from the tent she and Joe shared , and little Pun-na 's shrieks of joy as her new father and mother played with her . " I suppose it is an un-Christian thing to do  --  buying a child , I mean  --  but surely there can be no wrong in it . The parents might have gotten rid of the child in the winter , when food is scarce . In this way I have made Hannah happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of a sledge . " When I was silent , he turned and stared at me . " Is something wrong , Adam ? " " But our sledge ! " I protested . In this country a sledge was worth a great deal . The Esquimaux prized a good sledge and dogs more than anything else . Since a sledge was the only way to make any extended trip , a man put more value on his sledge than he did his wife . The Esquimaux artisans would work for months shaping runners , cunningly fashioning rawhide lashings and bone pins , ornamenting the whole with carved figures . The sledge Mr. Hall had bartered for Pun-na was an unusually fine one . Now , with only the  | one sledge that I had made in New London , we were seriously handicapped for any long trips . " What is a sledge , " demanded Mr. Hall , " to that poor woman 's happiness ? " A picture had long been in my mind ; indeed , it was seldom absent . I remembered a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes , a patient woman with tearstreaked face who wrapped up cookies for me to take on the train . Does n't he love me any more ? Will you tell him we love him , and think of him always ? Piqued by the loss of the sledge , I burst out with what was on my mind . " That poor woman 's happiness ? I wonder that you can speak so of Hannah , and give away one of our only two sledges , when you have so far forgotten your own wife and family , sir ! " He stiffened , and dropped the flap of the tupik . In the light of the oil lamp , his face became ashen . Clenching his fist , he came a step toward me , and I believe he would have struck me . A horrible change came over his face ; it seemed almost to writhe in anger , or perhaps it was a kind of personal agony . " Forgotten ? " His voice was strained . " Ah , Adam , to say such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " It is all very well to speak of love and happiness when you have abandoned your own family , I suppose , but it sticks in my craw . Sir , I admire you , and what you have done with so little , and in spite of opposition . But I would a damned sight rather you were more human and loving in your character ! A sledge for an Esquimaux baby ! Better some affection for your own flesh and blood , that is what I say ! " His face became suffused with a sudden inrush of blood . With an oath which I had never before heard from his lips , he seized me by the shoulder and pushed me down on the skin coverings of the floor . In his violence the net was torn from its customary place over the smoking lamp . It fell to the ground , spilling out  | the load of damp socks and underpants that was drying there . " Listen to the boy ! " He towered over me , biting at a corner of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  words that roll off the tongue glib and cheap ! Damn you , Adam ; oh , damn you ! " Beating one fist into the palm of the other , he threw his head from side to side like some great bear caught in a trap . " Adam , do you then know me so little ? After all these years , so great a mystery ? " " I do n't know , " I said sulkily . " All I know is ? " " Listen ! " He knelt beside me . " I need not explain my life to any man . I made my decision a long time ago , and it is too late to have it any other way . But let me tell you some things , Adam . " Tugging at a corner of his beard , he stared down at me , his eyes unfathomable ; filled with hurt perhaps , or anger , or pride  --  I did not know the emotion that made them so hard and unseeing . " Do you know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to turn your back on the homely life , to renounce love and affection for the darts and arrows of mean and jealous men ? " " I made a decision when I decided to come back to the Arctic with you , " I pointed out . " True ! True ! " Mr. Hall nodded violently . " But you are only a boy , Adam , or at best a young man , with no family to speak of ! It has always been natural for young men to leave the fireside and go into the world looking for fortune . Observe Mr. Charles Hall , however ! Some forty-odd years old with a wife and family , and a not especially successful printing business ! Can you not understand how much more it means to such a man , settled in his ways and encumbered with family and obligations , to throw off the traces ? " He ground one fist into the other in that gesture that showed how much he was distraught and concerned . " Adam , I tell you it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of my bed on Celestial Street and walked the paths about our house for hours on end , asking myself if this was the right , the proper thing to do !  | I would go back , and by candlelight examine the sleeping faces of my children , and ponder . I would sit on the edge of the bed and listen to my wife 's light quick breathing , asking myself what to do . Oh , God , what to do ! I knew the Franklin people were alive ; I felt it in my bones , and felt obliged to go and look for them . No one was making such an attempt , and these poor people called to me and cried out for help . Adam , could I do less ? Could I let my own comfort and ease keep me from the hard and dedicated life ? Could I do this , and call myself a fit father and husband ? " " I remember , " I said , " that when you were in Oolootong village , and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you talked to me about your plans , about what drove you , about why you felt obliged to do what you have done , and continue to do . " I was thinking about the way he had talked of the descending mathematical curve he felt himself rushing down ; of the fact that he was forty years old , and undistinguished . He had spoken then of his urge to make something of himself , and I found this to be at odds with his presently stated concern over having left his family and friends to roam the Arctic . " I do not wonder that you should bring this up , " he said . " But I can convince you it is not inconsistent . No man acts ever , Adam , from completely unmixed motives . We are all such an obstinate bundle of impulse and will and desire that we are never quite sure of our own motives , let alone those of others . " He picked up a shard of bone ; squatting beside me , he traced a complex pattern on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only human , Adam . I will not deny that I have thought of fame and glory , and desired to have my name someday inscribed on a medal . All men desire fame ; it is a way of seizing the immortality they might doubt on a heavenly basis . But all I can say is this . Franklin people or no , fame or not , here I am and here I stand on this Arctic continent . I will succeed here , or perish . And that is all I have to say . "  | He was a persuasive talker . How else would he have done so much with so little ? Even with my nagging doubt , and the picture in my mind of that small Cincinnati home , I was swept along with his eloquence . " I am sorry I said what I did , " I told him . He did not look up . Instead , with a single-minded intentness , he went on scribing in the dirt with the fragment of bone , pausing only to sigh heavily and shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled my furs about me , deciding to sleep . For a long time I lay there listening to the night sounds : the rustle of a small animal near our tent , the grinding of distant ice , the lap of water in a wind-stirred pool . Who was I to question his motives ? In such a great undertaking as his , was it not carping and unfair to bring up the matters I had struck on ? I went to sleep , and awoke only once during the night , hearing Mr. Hall groan and twist in his sleep . I think he spoke the name of his wife , though his voice was heavy and muffled and I was not sure . At any rate , I felt somehow pleased as I rolled myself again in my skins . This was a queer and complex man , and I was beginning to understand the mainspring that drove him . Proud and stubborn and of great ability , I think he resented the circumstance that forced him into the printer and engraver 's trade , with its inkstains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin matter , by sheer force of will he had made it his own , by way of pulling himself from obscurity . Uncertain and disappointed , he called out now for the wife and children he had not seen for many years . Of course he had not abandoned them ; he wrote when he could and sent small sums of money when he had it , which was not often . But he loved them , I do not doubt it . His tenderness with Joe and Hannah and little Pun-na was a natural outpouring of love for the familial life denied him . He must often have questioned , as he said , the decision that took him north . Ill , discouraged , penniless ; was he then not a better man than I for hewing to the decision in spite of such  | odds ? Rushing down the descending curve he had mentioned , fighting the elements and men and fate and public indifference , he somehow managed to stumble on in a way that was magnificent . When Adarn Burritt moldered in his winding sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not die with man 's physical body . It was too bright , too blinding , too hot . The ashes would at least warm others . I went to sleep . The Franklin survivors ! It was a will-of-the-wisp that danced ever before us . Now , after five years of searching on Baffin Island and the Melville Peninsula , we were still unsuccessful , with only a worn silver spoon for all our hardship and toil . I , an ordinary man , saw the futility of our efforts , but Mr. Hall was made of different stuff . Though from time to time discouraged , he came back like a tenacious bulldog to the purpose of our Arctic sojourn . Not that he any longer entertained any real hopes of finding the Franklin people alive ; the last that had been heard of them was now twenty years before . But a hundred-odd people do not vanish without leaving a trace . He was determined to settle for once and for all what had happened to them , and lay the mystery at rest . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , pointing out , " If I have found these leavings of Frobisher from three hundred years ago , how much more likely that I can find well-preserved traces of a party which vanished only some twenty years ago ! " Old Nartuk , as I have said , had been a thorn in our side . Jealous of Mr. Hall 's influence , seeing him as a rival an-ge-ko , Nartuk had been instrumental in our failure to reach the Straits of Fury and Hecla . Even now , he went on with his endless an-kooting in his big igloo at Noonoolik , some miles west of us , and encouraged the Esquimaux to rise against us and throw us out , claiming that the disease that had taken away so many dogs was of our doing .  | " This situation , " Mr. Hall said , " is becoming serious . Only yesterday , when I went out to take a sight , a little band gathered to mock me and call out evil things . It is not like these people to do such things without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I suppose so . " He sighed . " Well , so long as there is no open break between us , I do not intend to do anything . " Things might have gone on this way for some time , and eventually actual bloodshed might have occurred . We were well armed and could take care of ourselves , but that was hardly the point . We knew and respected these people . I think the letting of blood , even in necessity , would have so affected Mr. Hall that he would have given up his Arctic hopes and gone back to the States . Blood was shed eventually , although it was not of our doing . The event led , also , to a new journey to the Straits . It happened in this way . One day old Nartuk himself came to our igloo . We had not seen or heard from him for some time ; in fact , our relations with the Esquimaux had been somewhat better . Even though we bore no love for the an-ge-ko , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blood and sores , bearing the evidence of having been treated badly . " Ki-e-te , " said Mr. Hall . " Come in . " Old Nartuk knelt for a moment in the low tunnel , his face a study in fear and uncertainty . Then , reassured by the kindness in Mr. Hall 's voice , he got stiffly up and tottered toward us . " Pe-ong-too ! " he croaked . " Bad . Very bad . " He helped himself to a chunk of boiled seal meat from the pot that bubbled over the lamp , and squatted between us . " Oh , very bad ! I am in bad condition . " This was certainly evident , but in view of Nartuk 's hold on the Esquimaux , we were both curious as to how he had sustained such a beating . " Kod-lu-na , " he explained . Famished , he plucked out a seal eye , and after juggling it for a moment in his withered fingers , popped it into his mouth and licked his hands and wrists .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Noonoolik . " They beat me . They drive me away from my own igloo ! They are very bad men , all of them . They will kill me if I come back . " He looked pleadingly from one of us to the other . " You help me . You good men . You go back with me , help kill those bad kod-lu-na . " " White men ? " Mr. Hall tugged at his beard . " From whalers , eh ? " It was not uncommon , in view of the brutal treatment of men on the Hudson Bay whalers , for some to desert and set up housekeeping at a native village , hoping to beg passage back to the States on another vessel . " Why , " asked Mr. Hall with some acerbity , " did you not put a spell on them ? You are a great an-ge-ko , Nartuk  --  greater than I , to hear you tell it . " Nartuk looked embarrassed as well as he could . His face was such a mass of wrinkles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well . " I tried , " he said . " It did not work . I think there were too many of them for me . " " On one kod-lu-na your magic works , eh ? " Mr. Hall glowered . " But not on many . Is that it ? " Nartuk nodded . " Well , " said Mr. Hall , " I would be well advised to let you stew in your own juices , but I can not . These evil men may harm or injure other Esquimaux  --  people we know and love  --  so I think Adam and I had better go along with you , Nartuk , and look into this matter . " He turned to me . " Adam , load our sledge . Get our little shotgun from its flannel wrappings , and take plenty of powder and ball and caps for our pistols . We will go to Noonoolik village and see what can be done . " We went to Noonoolik , not knowing what we would find .  | IT took us three days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just beginning its annual trip above the horizon and most of the trip was made in darkness , Nartuk pointing the way by landmarks which we could often not see even when he called our attention to them . A slight hummock here , a pile of low rocks there , a stand of shrubs stark and bare in the snow . Mr. Hall took star sights and referred often to his compass , but no one had ever established the latitude and longitude of Noonoolik village . We were forced to rely entirely on tile an-ge-ko . " Not far now , " Nartuk said . He pointed to a flickering light in the dusk , at the base of a range of rocky hills . " That Noonoolik . " His toothless gums gaped in a grin , he being convinced that death and destruction was imminent for the kod-lu-na who had misused him . " You kill them all , eh ? " He patted the stock of Mr. Hall 's shotgun . " Shoot them in belly , eh ? Long time to die . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I was surprised to find Patrick Coleman at Noonoolik village . Like a bad penny , he had turned up again to plague us . Somehow or other , Coleman and his thin-lipped smile seemed to follow us like a spirit . Now here he was at Noonoolik , living like a lord in the igloo from which he and his companions had evicted Nartuk , levying tribute from the poor Esquimaux by force of arms . " Well ! " Coleman stood up in the gloom of the snowhouse , a pistol in one hand and a half-gnawed bone in the other . " If it ai n't Adam Burritt ! And old Hall ! " He gestured to a frightened Esquimaux man who cowered in the shadows . " Mukko here said you was on the way . Figured it would n't be long till you showed up . " Coleman 's four companions were an evil lot . There was a shrunken spidery little man named Nellis ; a giant and slowwitted hulk who answered to Parkes ; a fat man with face so porcine his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his name was Hobey something-or-other . The fourth was a Negro ; a silent man who sat in a corner and looked from one of us to the other , all the time fingering a knife in a sheath at his waist . Sam , he was called . A prime lot . Mr. Hall sat down , shotgun across his knees . Nartuk , from fear , had stayed outside . I beat the snow from my furs and sat beside Mr. Hall , one hand on the butt of the pistol inside my waistband . " No need to be hostile ! " Coleman said grinning , his tongue licking in and out in the way he had . " Put your scatter-gun away . Ai n't no one going to harm you . " Mr. Hall kept the gun across his knees . " I am not worried about myself . I understood you beat poor old Nartuk , the ange-ko . He is outside , expecting some redress . " Coleman guffawed . Parkes , the giant , laughed in an imitative way , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contortion almost lost in the folds of his flesh . Nellis shot a sharp glance at the Negro , who only went on fondling his sheath knife .  | " Sam did it . " Coleman pointed to the Negro . " Deef and dumb , he is . Hard to get through to him . He was only having a little fun , though . No harm meant , I 'm sure , mates . " Mr. Hall looked around him . " Is n't this Nartuk 's igloo ? " " Sure it is . " Coleman chuckled . " He went away , did n't he ? No use such a nice place going to waste . " He looked around him and patted his stomach . " Real comfortable . The old man left a nice stock of meat . Living like kings , we are . " " Nevertheless , " Mr. Hall said , " what you have done is wrong . You have no right to mistreat these people and move in on them this way . By so doing , you only cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a legitimate purpose . " " I ai n't taking orders from you ! " " I do not ask you to take orders from me , " Mr. Hall said steadily . " I only ask you to live among these people as friends , instead of giving all kod-lu-na a black name . " He shifted the shotgun on his knee . " I will ask you to start off by moving out of here and giving Nartuk back his house . " Coleman stared at Mr. Hall in complete unbelief . " Now , " said Mr. Hall firmly . Under other circumstances , or at least without that shotgun muzzle pointing at his belly , Coleman would have laughed , secure in the knowledge of his strength . After all , there were five of them and only two of us . But the shotgun muzzle stayed dead-center on Coleman 's belt buckle . When Parkes came to his knees like a faithful dog , big hands working at his sides , I pulled out my pistol and waved him back . " I am only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " These Esquimaux can be very warlike and cruel . They will put up with so much of your kind of mistreatment ; then they will strike , and you will be the sorrier for it . " Coleman squatted beside the lamp , lean legs folded under him like a crane . " I ai n't saying we will , and I ai n't saying we wo n't . But it do n't do no harm to talk things over a little first . "  | " All right , " said Mr. Hall . " But no tricks , sir . Someone will get killed , and it may be you . " Coleman waved his hand . " Hell , we 're all white men , ai n't we ? Except Sam here , but he 's a good man . We got to stick together in a country like this with all these gecks around . Ai n't that so ? " There was a general chorus of approval . Parkes looked at Coleman and nodded his big head slowly and massively . The fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't we , mates ? " Nellis only grunted , and Sam the Negro picked his nails with the sheath knife , watching our lips with an intentness that made me uneasy . " We can come to some agreement , " said Coleman . He pointed to the simmering kettle . " Eat up , mates . There 's tea in the pot there . " Turning to Mr. Hall he said , " I still got that note you signed for the eel spoon . Anything ever come of it ? " Mr. Hall scratched his chin . He seemed suddenly thoughtful . " No . At least , not yet . I took a party of natives on a journey to the Straits , but we never reached Igloolik . Bad weather turned us back . Bad weather , among other things . " I remembered the body Joe and I had found in the cove . " A while back I found a man lying on the beach near our camp . He had been murdered . There was a bullet hole in his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bender , Solomon Bender . " He swore horribly and said , " Burden did it , that damned Burden , of the Jessie . I tell you , that was a hellship ! Burden strung Solomon up and had him whipped , account of a bottle of wine missing from the lazaret . Bender was cookie , see ? He could n't stand it no more . He nipped over the side one night , and Captain Burden went after him himself . .. 1 du n no rightly what happened , except we heard the shot , and after a while Burden come back with his pistol stuck in his belt and a look on his face like a cat with a saucer of cream . Wo n't trouble us no more , ' he said . Wo n't steal no more of my wine , ' e won't. '  | That 's what he said , and offered the same to any man that did n't like what he done . " Coleman shook his head , and for a moment I felt almost sorry for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped ship . We was in fear for our lives . Ever since , we been here at Noonoolik , waitin ' for old bloody Burden and his Jessie to leave Hudson Bay . Next fall , when he 's gone , we 'll pop out and beg passage on some other whaler if we can . " " And if not ? " Mr. Hall asked . Coleman laughed . " If not , we 'll stay on . Hell , we 're good Arctic hands , all of us ! We know our way around . Live like the gecks , that 's what we 'll do . We ai n't scared ; no , not a bit of it . If a man 's got to die , he might as well do it here as in some foul rooming house in Nantucket . The devil ai n't choosy . He 'll come for us at Noonoolik soon as anyplace ! " " I suppose so , " Mr. Hall said . he was thinking about something , thinking very hard . " Help yourself to the stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a peg in the ice wall and handed it around , Mr. Hall and I refusing . " It 's a shame old Burden scragged Solomon Bender , " Coleman sniggered , " when it was me run off with the port , eh , boys ? " He dug Parkes in the ribs , and the giant chuckled . We talked for a while , even with some amicability , though I was thinking of poor Nartuk huddled outside and wondering when Mr. Hall was going to enforce his edict about evicting these scoundrels from Nartuk 's igloo . But the conversation took an unexpected turn that made me gasp . Mr. Hall started it off . " You are , as you say , good Arctic hands . And we kod-lu-na must stick together , for safety and success . Now I have a proposition to make to you all . " Coleman put down the bottle . " A proposition ? " " Aye , a proposition . I need men to go with me to search for the lost Franklin expedition . We were , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the natives to go farther . I am convinced that a party made up of white men can succeed  | in a sledge journey this time of year  --  if we start immediately , that is . What do you say ? " Coleman was astonished , as I think the rest of us were also . " Us , mate ? You mean you want  --  us to go with you ? " His surprise was almost ludicrous . " Yes , " said Mr. Hall . " That is what I mean . " Coleman looked from one of his cronies to the next . Some were eager and interested , others apathetic . Sam went on picking his nails with the knife . " What 's in it for us ? " Coleman asked . " Hell , we 're doing right well in this little cove here ! Sit out the rest of the winter , walk over to Repulse Bay when the weather lifts , work our way home on a whaler . " He looked crafty and cunning , which was not a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall said . " A hundred dollars for the lot of you , to be split however you decide best ! " Coleman spat . " A hundred dollars ? You still owe me two hundred on that note you give me . " From an inner pocket he took the folded bit of notebook paper . " Do n't think I forgot it , either . " He waved it aloft . " I have not forgotten it . " Mr. Hall got out his small notebook and a stub of pencil . " What do you say , eh ? A hundred dollars for the lot of you , secured by my further note . " Coleman rubbed his stubbly chin . He and Nellis and Hobey withdrew outside for a while to confer . The giant Parkes and Sam remained inside ; Parkes muttering to himself and rolling his eyeballs , Sam tossing the knife in a game of mumblety-peg on the frozen ground . " I do n't understand you , " I whispered to Mr. Hall . " These men are villains , all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course they are villains ! " In the light of the lamp I could see that he was perspiring ; hardly from fear , for he was indomitable . Nervousness perhaps , or a return of his sickness . " They are villains all , but rough and capable men , knowing where
