In a long and lucrative career on television , CBS 's Edward R. Murrow , 52 , developed a particular skill for the shame-of-America documentary that trains the camera eye on the dark corners of U.S. life . But last January Murrow decided to go to Washington , accepting a presidential appointment as director of the U.S. Information Agency . Last week , in a bumbling effort to kill a TV documentary that he himself had narrated , Ed Murrow made clear demonstration of the truism that one 's view can be shaped by one 's job . <P> The show in issue was Harvest of Shame , an hour-long study of the plight of the U.S. migratory worker presented last Nov. 25 on CBS Reports . Deliberately scheduled for the day after Thanksgiving , the documentary drew for turkey-stuffed Americans a stark picture of the field hands who rove about the country , living in makeshift squalor , and selling their labor for an average of $900 a year . Moving in shirtsleeves among the film 's subjects , Narrator Murrow reached heights of personal indignation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We used to own our slaves ; now we just rent them . " <P> Exaggerated Portrait . The plight of the migrant workers is bad ; but because of its overstatement , Harvest drew howls , especially from Florida 's U.S. Senator Spessard L. Holland , whose state was the one visited by Murrow . Harvest of Shame , said Holland , contained at least seven distortions and errors of fact . Holland cited , among others , the example of the 29-year-old Negro woman who told Murrow that she was the mother of 14 and had earned $1 for a full day 's work in the fields . The facts were , said Holland , that seven of her children were dead and that her meager wage was a measure of her own indolence . <P> The matter might have ended there if the British Broadcasting Corporation , which has first foreign rights to CBS Reports , had n't decided to pick up Harvest of Shame . Dismayed at the damage that a European showing of the film could do to the image of America that he was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBC in a vain effort to suppress the show . Harvest of Shame , said Murrow , had been for domestic use only . <P> CBS disagreed . " To deny overseas subscribers the use of a news report , " said a CBS spokesman , " would be inconsistent with basic principles of freedom of information . " The show went on , and the British press , aware of Murrow 's gag attempt , delightedly gave his role as narrator full billing . " Murrow 's documentary , " said the London Daily Herald , " blazed fiercely with his incomparable and indispensable indignation . " Wrote Neville Randall in the London Daily Sketch : " I can only say that if Murrow builds up America as skillfully as he tore it to pieces last night , the propaganda war is as good as won .
