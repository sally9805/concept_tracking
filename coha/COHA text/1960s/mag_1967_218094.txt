More than 75% of U.S. law school graduates are unready for practice , says Supreme Court Justice William Brennan . They leave school without having confronted " one live man or woman who is immediately in need of legal advice . " Most of them know too little about criminal law , to say nothing of trying a case . Yet every indigent U.S. felony defendant is now entitled to free counsel ; the Government aims to furnish free legal advice in slums , and the whole country needs able young trial lawyers . <P> One answer is to get law students out of the classroom and into the court room . Another is to lengthen legal education . Law graduates can find a rich combination of the two at Georgetown University Law School in Washington , D.C. Located in a seedy downtown area far from its Jesuit-run parent campus , the 1,300-student law school ( only 46% Catholic ) is a few blocks from city and federal courts , and a ten-minute walk from the Supreme Court . The area is a virtually ideal crime laboratory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Georgetown now boasts what U.S. Judge J. Skelly Wright calls " probably the most systematic and thorough training in trial advocacy offered anywhere in the country . " <P> Learning from Bondsmen . In 1960 , Georgetown launched the E. Barrett Prettyman Fellowships ( named for an alumnus U.S. judge ) , which annually pay up to eleven graduate students an average $7,000 , plus fees and tuition , to spend a year defending indigents . So far , the fellows have defended almost 2,500 clients , thus learning trial law while earning master 's degrees and providing needed representation in the process . <P> With the Ford Foundation paying the tab , Prettyman Fellows first spend two months studying some 600 cases , holding mock trials and visiting police stations . They get advice from judges , psychiatrists , even bail bondsmen . By midyear , a typical Prettyman fellow is handling no fewer than five misdemeanor cases , ten felonies , a couple of appeals and a constant series of preliminary hearings-all the while attending night classes at Georgetown and writing research papers . <P> As one result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new standard manual on federal trial tactics . As another , the fellows have won several important rulings , adding to the protection of criminal defendants . Moreover , the program has just been expanded to two years , adding such civil-law matters as tenants ' rights . <P> Nearly all Prettyman graduates feel duty bound to spend at least a couple of years carrying on with such public service ; about half seem committed to it permanently . As one student put it : " I came here interested in corporate practice and good living . I 've been made to feel guilty unless I 'm defending an indigent. "
