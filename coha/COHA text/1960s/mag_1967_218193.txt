As the world 's largest copper producer , Anaconda Co. has enjoyed unprecedented prosperity over the past three years , thanks in large part to worldwide industrial expansion and the quickened demands of the Viet Nam war . But copper people know only too well that theirs is an uncommonly volatile industry , in which good times are never to be taken for granted . In view of that , it was a sign of unusual optimism last week when Anaconda 's directors voted a two-for-one stock split and put dividends on a regular quarterly basis . <P> In large part , of course , those actions reflected Anaconda 's pretty profit picture . Controlling 40% of the world 's reserves at a time when copper prices have soared , the company last year registered a staggering 67% earnings gain to $132 million on sales of $1.2 billion . Even more important , the company is taking vigorous steps to meet some of its potential problems . <P> Chief among them is the fact that demand for copper has far outstripped supply , which poses the danger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or plastic . Moreover , to make sure that domestic and defense demand is met , the Federal Government has virtually locked U.S. producers out of higher-priced world markets by declaring a partial embargo on copper exports . Beyond that , the Government has required producers to set aside more than one-quarter of their output for military use . <P> Plainly , the copper industry can assure steady growth over the long haul only by building up production capacity . Accordingly , Anaconda has mapped a fiveyear , $600 million program to find new sources as well as improve existing facilities . At the same time , Anaconda Chairman Charles M. Brinckerhoff , 66 , recently signed a 20-year agreement with the Chilean government that should help stabilize the company 's operations in that country ; unlike its chief U.S. competitors , Kennecott and Phelps Dodge , both of which mine most of their copper at home , 65% of Anaconda 's supply comes from Chile . <P> Looking well into the future , Anaconda is confident that the demand will continue to be heavy-whatever happens in the Viet Nam war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a pent-up demand for autos , houses and new electrification that would be released if the war ended .
