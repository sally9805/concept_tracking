The Archbishop of Canterbury 's triad of visits to Jerusalem , Istanbul and Rome has been part pilgrimage and part a very English and empirical attempt to find out what is practical in the matter of cooperation be ? tween the separated brethren of Christendom . Dr. Fisher 's was religious exploration at its most tentative and boldest and bravest . The Roman call , because it was unprecedented since the Reformation and , indeed , since Thomas Arundel went ad limina to complain of Richard II , has attracted the most attention . In fact , in ecclesiastical politics the Roman visit has been of towering importance . It is clear that the Arch ? bishop is aiming at an arrangement , almost a sort of concordat , with the Pope . He has done the same with other faiths and would be happy to do so with more . He wants to achieve a practical cooperation , a dia ? logue rather than a continuation of controversy , which would be based on the idea that both sides are in good faith . He wants gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of sympathy , out of which practical agreements might grow . The agreement could be gossamer soft and razor-blade thin , but it would serve . No treaties anywhere are worth their paper without this unity , and if it were achieved it could conceivably lead further . Whether it could lead to a communion of the Churches , to a gen ? uine sacramental union , he did not foresee , hardly looked forward to , was prepared to leave contentedly to his successors and to God . The meeting with the Pope was an informal meeting between religious leaders . It was friendly and gentle and neither committed himself nor acted as head of State at a summit . The details of the meeting are not known . That it happened at all is significant enough . Of real importance , too , was the Archbishop 's unsched ? uled afternoon visit in Rome to Cardinal Bea . Cardinal Bea is a German Jesuit of 79 . He looks like a retired headmaster who has yet somehow maintained a kindly heart . He is tall and stooping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Unity . The visit mattered because the Commission , founded in May , 1960 , has been charged by the Pope to act as liaison office with the non-Roman Churches . It is to be a listener , an interpreter and a suggester of innovations . One of its two English members is Dr. Heenan , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool . For the Vatican this Commission is a startling new thing and is evidence of the direction of the Pope 's mind . To Cardinal Bea the Archbishop of Canterbury offered the cooperation of Lambeth and the Cardinal offered the services of his Commission . They , too , parted friends and uncommitted . It is apparent that there exists both in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches the same sort of yearn ? ing for a measure of cooperation . It lives strongly only in an important minority in each . The yearning is not exclusively spiritual in either . The world outside the Churches grows colder and colder and the Churches are the minority . How tragic , then , how imprudent , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear have changed the ecumenical movement from being the preserve of eccentric or independent intellectuals to becoming an integral part of both Churches . In France many priests and monasteries will lend their altars to Anglicans for the celebration of Com ? munion , believing that the things in common outweigh the differences . In the city of Rome such casual disci ? pline is not allowed . In England it arouses distaste . There are historical reasons for this . The Tudor officers of the British Crown made attendance at the reformed parish church the acid test of acceptance of the Act of Supremacy . To attend a non-Catholic church was there ? fore to apostasize . And the tradition still lives among the Roman Catholics in England . But it does seem that the Pope , through his long stay in France , from his experience of Muslim countries and his closeness to Communist frontiers as a Papal diplo ? mat , has been touched by the ecumenical movement . There is certainly opposition to it inside the Vatican . As in any civil service which is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which public opinion has virtually no effect , maneuvering and delicate intrigue take place . It is the inevitable weapon that dignitaries use to promote what they believe to be right . Such goings on are , of course , subject to more hostile interpretations . Reports of what happens within the Vatican are more widespread in Rome and even less reliable than those of the conduct of the Royal Family in England . But it is known that the chief conservatives are Cardinal Tardini , the Cardinal Secretary of State , and Cardinal Ottaviani , the head of the Holy Office . They are men of great power and singleness of mind ; they regard too overt an ecumenicalism with practiced suspicion . Probably because of them the Archbishop 's visit was accompanied by a notable lack of conventional publicity . Not only were there none of the usual photo ? graphs of the Pope and his visitor together , but photog ? raphers were barred from the vast piazza of St. Peter 's , which is Vatican territory . And some have taken the absence of public relations facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not wish to embarrass the Archbishop with publicity since his visit was not one of purely routine courtesy . But it was evi ? dence of a curious sort of first-night nervousness . Whatever the reason , the fact remains that final power lies with the Pope . He can override his entire college of cardinals and all his civil service . To do this needs vigor and continuity . If he fails in health or will , if he dies , then all depends wholly upon his successor . Pope John has decided on a Vatican Council ( an " ecu ? menical council " to the Romans ) . It will probably con ? vene in the spring of 1962 . Cardinal Bea 's Commission is apparently a part of this and the Commission grows thereby in importance . The projected council is unique . Past councils have been summoned to promulgate a doctrine or to combat a heresy or an evil tendency . This second Vatican coun ? cil is apparently concerned with the domestic affairs of the Church . The modernization of its disciplines , inci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hard to see how its relations with its separated brethren can fail to intrude . The area of possible change within its principles is surprisingly large . The council could allow convert clergymen to be reordained as Roman priests and yet keep and cohabit with their wives . That affects no point of doctrine . A vernacular mass could be approved for the English-speaking world and even a local liturgy allowed . There is little demand for this . The rules for strictly enclosed religious orders , particularly for nuns , could be relaxed to bring them more into the world . The rules about fasting and abstinence and cremation , about remarriage after an unsuccessful mixed marriage , could be radically changed . The bishops all over the world have sent in their suggestions and they are being collated . This process isnearly over . It has not yet been decided if representa ? tives of other faiths should be sent as observers . If and when the council meets its proceedings will be formal and in Latin . As in most legislatures the real work will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in copes and white mitres will not re-enact the confusion that was the Vatican Council of 1870 . That council which was ill-prepared , declared the doctrine of infallibility and leaked the proceedings to the press as freely and as unreliably as a Congres ? sional committee . This time the preparations are elabo ? rate and those taking part are sworn to secrecy . The council remains an enigma . But change of a sort is in the air . The most that can be said is that some are getting ready for a limited social and political cooperation ? and that is still an eternity away from full communion . It is just conceivable that the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury might one day attend midnight mass in a chair of honor in Roman Catholic Westminster Cathe ? dral . It is just conceivable that a Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster might attend a . Coronation seated in - an Abbey stall . It is not now conceivable that they should offer the holy sacrifice at each other 's altars or receive the Sacrament ever from each other 's hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canterbury is the custodian of the tradition of the English Reformation . This was more than a nega ? tive revolt against the spiritual domination of a foreign Power . It was affirmation of the idea that Holy Writ and a man 's conscience before God are the only final authorities . Hence the many aspects of Protestantism . The Catholic view is the opposite ? that God created a single Church , specially endowed it and gave its keys to the successors of Peter . There can be no bargaining with other Churches as it were between equals . Re ? union is not a real question because there is no disunity . The Church has always been one and indivisible as well as holy and apostolic . Non-Catholics are not members of the Church . If reunion means anything it means re ? turn to the Mother . Those outside the Church are simply in error . They are not thereby damned ; they must be treated with charity ; they are under the un ? covenanted mercies of God . Dr , Fisher has shown himself clinically aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any woolly optimism or compromised on essentials . He speaks of the Pope as an equal both before God and as an admitted head of a communion . To anyone prepared to listen he has been cautious , clear , never polemical , and he has been con ? structive . His ideas will not be ignored , at least by the new liberals of the Roman Church . But that cooperation and courtesy and a spiritual affection can exist between separated communions was demonstrated in Istanbul . The Patriarch of Constanti DECEMBER 20 , 1900 nople does not recognize the validity of Anglican ord ? ers . ( The whole question is obscure and controversial and damnably dangerous for a reporter . The Orthodox recoil with distaste from the exactitude of Rome , from its passion for exactitude and definitions as well as from its ritual which , to them , is almost Methodist in its austerity . ) Patriarch and Archbishop agreed to a reopening of theological talks . These are to be held with representatives of the whole Orthodox Church not , as before , with parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convened on the island of Rhodes before the Vatican Council meets . But in Istanbul the definitions were laid aside and the Archbishop was invited to attend the solemn celebra ? tion of the liturgy of their patron St. Andrew in the poor church of the Phanar . The Phanar is a plaster chapel in a slum . Its candlesticks lean , ikons are as dark as old shoes , stove pipes compete with Victorian chan ? deliers for air space and yet it is the direct and indis ? putable heir of St. Sophia , the most splendid church that men ever built . The Patriarchs here were the pon ? tiffs of the Byzantine Empire , and by an episcopal standard they take second precedence in Christendom . His All Holiness Athenagoras the First celebrated the liturgy . He is old and tall and straight and huge and vigorous and splendid and an overpowering personality . His beard is white and long and he is the only cleric in Turkey under the rules of Ataturk still allowed to wear it unclipped in the Orthodox manner . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked and could somehow find the money to pay the fare . His church was crowded . Two galleries , one above the other , could not have held another Christian . They stood for nearly three hours , most with nothing to see , only to hear the liturgy , the fierce , joyful hymns , and the splendid chant . Canterbury in his Coronation cope and mitre was conducted to a throne in the choir . The Orthodox priests , still in robes of imperial splen ? dor , went through the slow and beautiful liturgy . The Patriarch appeared at the door of the Eikonastasis to bless or cense the people and to show them the species that were to be changed . He consecrated under a trem ? bling veil held up by priests . And the Patriarch and the deacons and the choir took their turns to keep the church full of the throat-straining chant and singing . When it was over the two prelates faced each other on thrones across the choir . The Patriarch stood crowned leaning on a snake-topped staff . They made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gation crowded in to touching distance . They were helped down into the well of the choir . Happily they kissed each other three times and Canterbury was given yet another pectoral ikon . It was splendid to look at and better to think of . We left Dr. Fisher on the steps of his throne with an endless queue of Greeks pressing for ? ward to kiss his ring . There is even now close if untheological cooperation with the Orthodox . If they agree among themselves , Canterbury may get not communion but at least a con ? cordat . All he has done in Rome was to seek the same off the Romans . It is just ? only just ? possible that he or his successors may get even that . But neither with the Orthodox nor with the Latins would it yet be true union . I have just returned from a trip to Africa and Europe , on the basis of which I conclude that Americans do not fully appreciate the extent to which President-elect John F. Kennedy has aroused expectations that often are almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university people with whom I was able to talk concluded , nine times out of ten , with the words : " We shall see if Kennedy can . . , " or , " There is barely time for Kennedy to . . . , " etc . The justified warnings which Mr. Kennedy voiced during his campaign on the decline in US prestige were gratefully noted in Europe as well as in Africa , and they gave rise to hopes , some times rather immoderate , in the most diverse places . It must be admitted that these hopes were somewhat dampened by Kennedy 's failure in his TV debates with Richard Nixon to specify with any precision just what he would do to render American policies more effective and enhance US prestige , dampened also by the reali ? zation that the new President might repeat some of the mistakes of the past , as for example , in Cuba . There has been concern too over the narrow margin of Kennedy 's victory , as a result of which , it is believed in Europe , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and methods from the previous Adrninis
