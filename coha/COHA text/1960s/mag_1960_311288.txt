It was a week to gladden the hardest-hearted politician ; from coast to coast the trombones blasted out , the bunting rippled , the political speakers roared . Thousands of chickens made the supreme sacrifice , turned up as patties and croquettes on thousands of tables at Lincoln Day dinners and Democratic rallies . In Washington , at a wingding sponsored by the D.C. League of Republican Women Voters , Dick and Pat Nixon listened without a wince to a chorus of college girls who shrilly serenaded them with a new song , to the tune of Clementine : <P> Out of Calif. , to old D.C. <P> You did come and make your mark , <P> As the V.P. of the U.S. <P> You have won so many hearts . . . <P> The Democrats whooped it up in like fashion . New York Democrats , at a big dinner at the Waldorf , were treated to the spectacle of Tammany Boss Carmine De Sapio solemnly reading a " Nixon nomination-acceptance speech , " patterned after ' T was the Night Before Christmas : <P> I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As only Dick Nixon can really get <P> rough . <P> I 'll smear and slander , vilify , attack , For of guts and spirit I sure have no <P> lack . . . <P> Amid the poetry and razzmatazz , there were some discordant , familiar old notes . Massachusetts ' John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Minnesota 's Hubert Horatio Humphrey , the Democrats ' two out-in-the-open candidates , began to jab the Republicans-and each other-a little harder . In Santa Ana , Calif. , hard by Nixon 's home town , Humphrey said the Vice President would be a " negative , nogo , go-slow , not-now , veto type of executive . " At a rally of the amateur-politico California Democratic Council in Fresno , Kennedy warned that the party " would be committing a grave error if it ever tried to out-Nixon Nixon . " * Nonetheless , at the same rally , the names of Nixon and of Texas ' Lyndon Baines Johnson , Democratic leader of the U.S. Senate , were booed and hissed ( California Governor Pat Brown later apologized , said the delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson , in Mexico , far from the political noisemaking , received the most applause . <P> Later , in Manhattan , attacking the Administration , Jack Kennedy looked over the land , overlooked prosperity , and seemed to see a U.S. shrunk even from the Khrushchev vision ( " a limping horse " - see FOREIGN NEWS ) . " Seven million have an income of less than $2,000 , " he proclaimed to the New York politicos . " There are 15 million on a substandard diet ; 17 million are not covered even by the $1 minimum wage . We have more than 3,000,000 unemployed workers with jobless benefits averaging less than $31 a week . " In Fresno , Humphrey took up the same theme : " We can not , in good conscience , enjoy our prosperity when 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 of our fellow human beings walk the streets looking for work . "
