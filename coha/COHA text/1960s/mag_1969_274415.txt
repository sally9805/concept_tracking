These days , there seem to be nearly as many newsmen coming out of China as news items . Five days after the release of Reuters Correspondent Anthony Grey ( TIME , Oct. 10 ) , the doors of a Shanghai prison swung open for a freelance journalist , Norman Barrymaine , 19 months after he had entered it . Four days later , a onetime London Daily Herald feature writer ( and more recently a Chinese government translator ) named Eric Gordon was allowed to leave Peking with his wife and 13-year-old son after nearly two years under house arrest . The three journalists ' remembrances added up to a sometimes incredible picture of the weird variety and brutal mentality of Chinese jailers. * <P> From a gaunt Anthony Grey , home in London , came the description of a drab solitude " much worse than anyone can imagine . " Grey , the best known of the three ( and last week awarded the Order of the British Empire ) , was confined for 26 months in his Peking home-mostly in one room-solely in retaliation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riots of 1967 . Describing " the worst moment of my two years " in an interview with a Reuters colleague , Grey told of the hot August night shortly after his capture , when some 200 Red Guards swarmed into his house and dragged him downstairs to the courtyard . <P> " They painted me with black paint , " he said , " and forced my arms behind me so that my body was bent forward . Whenever I tried to straighten up , a Red Guard punched me in the stomach . I sweated so much that a pool formed on the ground under my eyes and I could see my reflection in it . " Then , after a sudden silence followed by applause , " I was told to straighten up . A few inches in front of my eyes dangled the body of my cat , Ming Ming , hanged from the roof by a washing line . " When the crowd began chanting " Hang Grey , " he was roughly ushered back inside the house to find posters stuck up everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint . <P> Throughout his imprisonment , his guards never spoke . They only stared at him or sang revolutionary songs and chanted slogans . In return , he gave them insulting nicknames-Pervert Jaw , Peking Man-composed rhymes about them and sang to himself . He was allowed a few books , including a manual of yoga , which , he says , " turned out to be my salvation . " By last Christmas , he had become almost sanguine . On that day , he related , " I felt a quiet sort of joy . I put on my best suit , to the puzzlement of the guards , and I tried to make it special , though I was so alone . " <P> Bloody Words . Norman Barrymaine , 69 , was also alone last Christmas . For him , the Kafkaesque nightmare began on a cold day in February 1968 , shortly after the North Korean capture of the Pueblo . Barrymaine had gone to North Korea aboard a Polish freighter to cover the Pueblo story , but was denied permission to go ashore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did get a shore permit . Once on China 's soil , he made the mistake of accepting his guide 's invitation to photograph at will . When he snapped torpedo boats in the Shanghai river , he was arrested .
