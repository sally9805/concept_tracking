Outside the wrought-iron gate of Preservation Hall on St. Peter Street in New Orleans stood " Babe " Stovall . For once he was not carrying his battered old guitar ease . A refugee from the cotton fields of southern Mississippi , " Babe " sings country bhies and spirituals in the hall sometimes for coins tossed in a basket . With him that afternoon was a quiet young Negro , his nephew Lester Ratliff . They were fresh out of the Orleans parish jail . We.had read about the big police raid on the Quorum Club , at 611 Esplanade , ' the night before . The States-Item had given the story a front-page spread : " JUDGE ORDERS $100 BONDS IN VICE SEIZURES . Police ' Sergeant Frederick Soule , Jr. , said the site  --  a downstairs coffee shop and upstairs apartment  --  was the scene of Communist propaganda , homosexual parties and integration agitation . " Al Jaffe , who runs the concerts of jazz originals which draw people to Preservation Hall from all over the world , unlocked the graceful iron gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We was n't doing nothing - Wrong and they threw us in jail , " " Babe " said . " Kept us all night long with no place but the floor to sleep . My daughter , Betty Jean , is still locked up and about to go plumb out of her head . Wonder can you gentlemen help me ' get Betty Jean out of that Place ? I never see the like all my life long . I was n't disturbing nobody 's peace like the policemen say , just picking my guitar and singing . " At the Criminal Courts building on Tulane Avenue we could unearth no one who was willing to accept the $100 cash bond money which we sought to post for Betty Jean 's release . The game was to make us go to one of the bonding companies across the street , but that would have cost 13abe " a nonreturnable fee of $25 . A man with a wife and ten children , existing on the proceeds of passing round the basket at his occasional " gigs , " could ill afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawyers ' Constitutional Defense Committee , a group of attorneys from all over the United States who devoted their summer vacations this year to defending civil rights workers in Mississippi and north Louisiana . George Hinkley of New York came over right away . He tried to secure Betty Jean 's release through a phone call to the judge . The judge was not at home to Hinkley , although a few minutes later a call from the bonding company where we went next brought His Honor instantly to the phone . Only if we paid the bonding company the $25 would the girl be freed , we were told . I then called Jack Nelson , a local attorney . Nelson handled the Tulane desegregation case , as well as many other sit-in and civil rights cases . Last year he received the annual award of the Catholic Council on Civil Liberties , He is also vice chairman of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice . Nelson drove down from his home and talked with us before telephoning the judge and arranging for Betty Jean to be paroled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutality to which she had been subjected , and almost hysterical with fear that she would lose her job as a maid in a motel . The next night Loyola University was throwing a civil rights party under the sponsorship of Father L. J Twomey 's Institute of Human Relations . I had been asked to give a reading of my poetry there . I took " Babe " Stovall along . He received an ovation from the large integrated assembly of priests , seminarians , students and Summer Project civil rights workers in from the front lines of north Louisiana and Mississippi . It happened to be the feast day of St. Ignatius of Loyola Archbishop John Patrick Cody of New Orleans put in an appearance , together with Father Andrew C. Smith , president of Loyola University . It was a real switch for " Babe " Stovall , arrested and jailed July 29 for singing at an integrated coffeehouse , feted July 31 for singing the same songs before the Archbishop of New Orleans and other leaders of the Catholic community at an integrated university function . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at the Quorum Club on Esplanade , bordering the French Quarter . Investigation had convinced me that the July 29 raid was a police frame-up , and my reading was a benefit for the seventy-three persons who had been arrested and jailed . The NATION A ' tremendous spirit of fighting back against the police was in evidence at my reading ; the floor was packed and people were hanging in the windows and doors . A New Orleans TV station made a documentary of the affair . Afterwards I started digging into the background and real nature of the raid . On the night of July 29 , there was the usual quiet crowd in the Quorum , which occupies the ground floor of an old house . The two upstairs floors are private apartments . In one of them a party was going on that night , quite unconnected with the Quorum except that whites and Negroes were present both there and in the downstairs coffeehouse . In the Quorum people were conversing at the tables over coffee and bottles of pop , alcohol being strictly prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in progress . " Babe " Stovall , who had been fetched from , his nearby slum quarters to furnish some entertainment , sat down on the little stage and began tuning his guitar . His daughter , Betty Jean , and his nephew , Lester Ratliff , who had come along with " Babe " for company , sat down at a table and were served a glass of iced tea and a Coke . Everybody stopped talking when " Babe , " a great favorite at the club , began his theme song , a spiritual called Time Is A-Windin ' Up . Time  --  time  --  time is a-win din ' up , Destruction on the land , God goan ' lift His hand . A fat , pompous , Negro often seen in the club made his way up to the stage and handed " Babe " a paper . People assumed he was requesting a number " Babe " stopped singing and put down his , guitar in astonishment . " This is a raid , " shouted the fat Negro , glaring at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gag " I ai n't kiddin ' you , " the man bellowed . " All y'all line up against the wall . " A half dozen uniformed white cops then surged into the club and began shoving people around in the usual New Orleans style . The fat Negro was one of two Negroes among a number of undercover police agents who had been assigned to get something on the only truly integrated place of public resort in the city . The South Louisiana ' Citizens Council had first blown the whistle on the club last January . Jackson Ricau , executive director of the council and one of three Catholics excommunicated for attempted sabotage of parochial school desegregation in the archdiocese , had called for a crusade against the Quorum in his monthly bulletin . The club , Ricau maintained , was " nothing more than an integrated meeting place ( white girls , Negro boys ; Negro girls , white boys ) for our brainwashed youth . . . . They all take off their shoes and get real cozy . There are many rooms upstairs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extermination . " Black students , " he wrote , " come from Chicago and New York and are paid to prey on our good white boys and girls " Ricau got in another lick about the " upstairs rooms " and posed the classic question , " Do you want your daughter to join this club ? " When the Quorum Club was raided , the private upstairs apartment where a party was going on was also hit . Police broke in and arrested everybody present . When the host protested , he was thrown downstairs . In all , seventy-three integrators were bagged upstairs and down , hauled off in paddy wagons , and held overnight in five small cells Among those jailed were an attorney , two faculty members from Louisiana State University in New Orleans , a teacher from Xavier Preparatory ' School , several married couples who had left their kids at home with baby sitters , the sevenmonths ' - pregnant daughter of a prominent Dallas attorney , together with her writer husband , scions of ' distinguished New Orleans families and three elderly ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esplanade , one of the loveliest streets in town , and had dropped into the Quorum for a cup of coffee . One of the three was the widow of a sheriff . The sexes as well as the races were segregated in jail . A young woman was saying good-by to her escort through the bars An officer yanked her away : " Quit talkin ' to that nigger , lady ! " " That ' nigger , ' " replied the young woman , " is my husband " She was a quadroon . The white women , including the sheriff 's elderly widow , reported being " talked to terrible " by the police while in jail . All were obscenely reviled and accused of sexual intimacy with Negroes . A prominent local attorney said to me later , " The police of New Orleans , reasoning perhaps from their own habits and proclivities , can not envisage whites and Negroes coming together for any other purpose than to copulate . " Next day the afternoon States-Item , only New Orleans alternative to the morning Times-Picayune but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carried a story on the raid which read more like a typical smear in an ultra-Right hate sheet than an account in a responsible newspaper . The fact that the charge was only a disturbance of the peace was glossed over completely . Following the sweeping allegations of communism , homosexuality and integrationist agitation given by Sergeant Soule , thief of the vice squad , one of the two Negro undercover police agents was interviewed at length . " We were in the club on two or three occasions , " this man said . " There was an assortment- of people , mostly homosexuals . There were a lot of beatniks , strumming guitars with no tune for hours and things like that going on . Intellectual conversations without any point . . . . " There were conversations on the value of communism and how much better it was than democracy and like every night classes on voter registratidn . They had blanks , sample questions and all to fill out . " The " Communist propaganda " charge is repudiated by every person familiar with the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced . Even the voter-registration classes which the Negro undercover agent seemingly equated with communism  --  leading one to wonder what he Meant by the word " democracy " ? never took place . The only " blanks " ever on display at the Quorum were petitions to save the Canal Street trolley cars which have since been replaced by buses despite a campaign by lovers of the old New Orleans . Next morning 's Times-Picayune rehashed the story , stressing again the Communist-homosexual fabrication , and publishing the names and addresses of all ' seventy-three persons taken in the raid . In the case of Negroes , designation of race followed their names , a rule of style when reporting crime in the local press . Immediately following the revelation of the identities of those arrested , economic reprisals and obscene phone calls began , as the Times-Picayune no doubt foresaw . Mrs. Charlene Jennings , a young mother of two who had been nabbed in the raid along with her husband , Ben Jennings , reported to her usual secretarial . jab at Emile Babst , electrical contractors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We had a couple of calls this morning . Your name was in the paper . " Later in the day the Jennings family received an eviction notice from their apartment at 1127 Royal Street in the Quarter . No reason was given . The Jenningses were also pilloried by the Parents and Friends of Catholic Children , This piously disguised hate-merchandising outfit does its dirty business out of P.O. Box 3071 in New Orleans . It also operates a block of telephone lines which spew fantastic and constantly varied lies into the trembling ears of dialers . Most messages deal with international Jewish plots and race-mixing conspiracies . Cigar-chomping Judge Leander Perez , the excommunicated racist dictator of Plaquemines Parish , is likened to Joan of Arc burned at the stake by a Satanic Archbishop resembling the present incumbent of the See of New Orleans . The Jenningses were named and their address given in a recording played over phone number 242-5500 . The Southern Bell Company of Louisiana flatly refuses to divulge the source of these vile messages , although the Parents and Friends of ' Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ' company maintains that the systematic assassination of character is privileged when it is conducted over a telephone line . " More than just coffee was being served at the coffeehouse , " declared the anonymous voice at the other end of the line when 242-5500 was dialed . " Integration , a discussion of Communist over American ideals , and a sprinkling of sex made up the ingredients of this weird and very strange concoction . This was a real jambalaya of moral and social outcasts and misfits . Among those attending were Ben Jennings of 1127 Royal . . . . " There followed several names selected ' at random from the Times-Picayune list . " How many more were also present at this association of whites and blacks dancing together , carousing together , and discussing Communist literature and propaganda ? Sergeant Soule of the vice squad stated . . . . " The recording wound up with a digest of the States-Item article . Hermann Deutsch , veteran ' columnist for that newspaper , added some embellishments to the smear job . In a column captioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded the field of " vice " represented at the Quorum , muttering about dope addicts and alcoholics as well as homosexuals . Not so much as a stick of marijuana had been found in the raid , much less any heroin . The Qtiorum was probably the only night spot in town where liquor was not served ; a house rule does not allow even a can of beer to be brought on the premises . While referring darkly to " transvestites , junkies and kleptomaniacs , " Deutsch did grant that some innocent persons had been swept up in the dragnet ? " otherwise blameless young ladies and gentlemen , as well as an egghead , beatnik and bleeding-heart contingent . " Deutsch concluded his slanderous column sanctimoniously with a text from St. Paul 's Epistle to the Corinthians . " Evil associations corrupt good manners " was adduced to prove that the Apostle would ? have blessed a vicious police frame-up . Four of the seventy-three persons rounded up at the Quorum Club panicked and pleaded guilty to the charge of distrubing the peace . An absolute terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On all sides one can hear the fatalistic saw , " You ca n't fight City Hall . " But the four who " thickened out " found other excuses for their capitulation ? impending trips to Europe , necessity for peace of mind , etc . Sixty-nine people , however , would not be moved and entered not-guilty pleas . " I told the judge I ai n't did nothing , " " Babe " Stovall asserted , " and I be dawg if I was going to say I did . " Trial of the sixty-nine was set for September 22 , almost two months after the raid . The excessive delay was obviously intended to apply the maximum pressure on the defendants , permitting the newspaper smears and hate messages to create a climate of ostracism and potential violence . But it ' did not work out that way . At first the raid seemed to have achieved its major purpose . Most of the Negro patrons of the club stopped coming . So did a number of the white habitues . Property owners in the vicinity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds with venomous hatred were they that one more level-headed member of the group con-fessed to me his conviction that bombing of the club was imminent . He discontinued his usual evening promenade past the Quorum lest he and his pair of dogs intercept the explosive . The stewards of the , Chiesa del Redentore , the Italian Methodist Church next door which owns the Quorum building , were pressured into asking the club to vacate . For good measure , , another city department cracked down on the club , alleging a zoning ordi-nance had been violated , and threat-ening to lift the Quorum 's ' legiti-mately granted restaurant license . The Parents and Friends of Catholic Children put a new recording on the line , claiming that the Quorum on Esplanade was associated with Bob-by Baker 's , notorious Washington club of the same name , and lead been established to corrupt a . previously virtuous New Orleans . Despite the smear campaign , the falling away of the timorous and the general terror , the directors and Mends of the Quorum fought back . Perceiving that the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow if the Quorum defendants should be found guilty , the New ' Orleans NAACP took up the case and offered the defense its full support . A number of benefits were held , culminating in a Human Rights Rally at a French Quarter theatre just prior to the trial . No cops interrupted " Babe " Stovall on this occasion . The , " guitars without any tune " came on stage  --  played by a couple of good flamenco men and an exceptionally good classical guitarist . Poetry and speeches completed the program , which was extensively Covered by two New Orleans television stations , although the newspapers boycotted the rally . The case was finally brought to trial September 22 , in an overcrowded municipal courtroom on Rampart Street . The defendants were represented by a battery of fifteen lawyers including Ben Smith , Louisiana representative of the American Civil Liberties Union ; Ernest Morial , president of the New Orleans NAACP ; Earl Amedee of ? the NAACP Legal Defense Fund ; and Jack Nelson . After an attempt to try the defendants en masse had collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the causers of - the " disturbance . " The city attorney then moved to nol-pros and the entire case was dismissed . The city attorney now threatens to charge the host of the private party , who was thrown downstairs , with " assault " for allegedly tearing an officer 's shirt on that occasion . This is probably just about as true as Sergeant Soule 's feverish tales of " Communist propaganda , homosexual parties and integration agitation , " though it does represent a great reduction in the scale of the lying .
