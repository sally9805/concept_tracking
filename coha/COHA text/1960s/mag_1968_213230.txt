Cuban Revolutionary Che Guevara spent the last year of his life trying without success to topple the government of Bolivia . Ironically , Che has come close to doing in death what he could not achieve in life . Last week the 14-man Cabinet of Bolivia 's President Ren Barrientos resigned in the embarrassed furor following the leak of Che 's diary to his old boss , Fidel Castro . <P> Barrientos ' troubles began two weeks ago , when his Minister of Government , Antonio Arguedas , fled abruptly to Chile . There he admitted giving the diary to Castro so that Fidel could be the first to publish it . Describing himself as a " Marxist , " Arguedas said he had airmailed the diary to a Castro mail drop in Paris to demonstrate " my position as a revolutionary and friend of the Cuban revolution . " <P> Barrientos tried to be understanding about the defection of his friend and chief assistant : " He claimed to be a Marxist , and I tried to convert that into Bolivian nationalism . " Though he flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peruvians had refused him a visa-Arguedas professed a willingness to return to Bolivia and " confront the responsibilities inherent in the deed that I committed . " Barrientos at first considered his favorite resort in times of stress : a flight into the hinterlands to talk with the Indian campesinos , who provide much of his popular support . But at week 's end he settled down to the task of forming a new Cabinet that would be Che-proof.
