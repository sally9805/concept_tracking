txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 22 Letters to the Editor of The Times Powell 's Significance for Harlem To the Editor : In the hysteria to unseat Adam Clayton Powell because of his abuse of his Congressional rights and his conduct in private life , the effect on the people of his district has seemingly been ignored . The manner in which he is being opposed could result in a serious setback for his district . The opposition to Mr. Powell is being led by members of Congress and encouraged by the press , none of whom come from or represent the community . If their efforts are successful , the voter in Harlem will again experience the frustration and dampening of hope which has become his " American way of life . " Unseating Powell will mean one thing to the Negro ? no matter how much he achieves , if the white man does not like it , then the white man will take it away . Mr. Powell represents a major achievement to the voters in his district . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is relatively unimportant , especially when Mr. Powell certainly can not be the only member of Congress guilty of misconduct . The people of his district have raised Mr. Powell to power through their own unity and strength . If this unity and strength are to grow , the removal of Mr. Powell can only be achieved by those who elect him . RONAL ! ) JOHNSON New York , Jan. 5 , 1967 ? Law on Unseating Members of Congress To the Editor : Regrettably , Ellen Malino James in her letter published Jan. 10 , replying to my Jan. 5 letter , misconstrues the purpose and intent of Article I , Section 5 of the Constitution , which , incidentally , I had not overlooked . That section does not give the House the right to unseat a Representative , but rather to require him to leave the Congressional chamber . Removal from office of a member of Congress is coyertd by Article I of the Constitution . Section 2 provides that the House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment . Section 3 provides that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of twothirds of the members present . " Thus the House of Representatives in effect hands up the indictment and the Senate acts as a trial court . A careful reading of the Constitution would seem to make it clear that there is a distinction between a " removal from office " and " expel a member . " Were the procedure otherwise it would , of course , be possible to destroy the two-party system and to effectively silence a minority voice . I am sure that such was never intended by the writers of the Constitution . The Powell case , if it does nothing else , will stimulate many citizens to read the written laws under which we are governed . GEORGE M. BURGH New York , Jan. 10 , 1967 ? Center No Sponsor of Mall To the Editor : On Dec. 6 The New York Times published a news story about a proposal to create a broad mall between Lincoln Center and Central Park . A considerable amount of criticism followed publication of the proposal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts . Such is not the case , and the purpose of this letter is to set the record straight . Lincoln Center did not conceive or initiate this plan , nor has it taken a position concerning the mall concept . Further , Lincoln Center is convinced that any change must not damage the present services or future mission of the institutions located in the area involved  --  namely , the New York Society for Ethical Culture and the West Side Young Men 's Christian Association . Lincoln Center is confident that all ramifications of the mall idea will be fully considered by the institutions and city agencies involved . Until such long-range planning has taken place , endorsement by anyone seems premature and ill advised . WILLIAM SCHUMAN New York , Jan. 10 , 1967 The writer is president of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts . ? Bus Exhaust Controls To the Editor : In his letter published Jan. 6 Daniel T. Scannell neglects many of the recommendations made by the Mayor 's task force to control pollution from diesel buses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , LPG , as has been tried by Chicago and other cities . Existing Fire Department regulations hamper the widespread use of LPG as an automotive fuel , but the fact that buses are fueled at centrally located garages makes it relatively simple to overcome this impediment . Technology is currently being developed for the use of liquefied natural gas , LNG , as a motor fuel . Application of this development will produce an almost pollution-free exhaust . An LNG plant is already under construction in Brooklyn . Since well-proved gas engines can be utilized with this fuel , an extensive developing period will not he required , as is needed with the gas turbine engine . While the catalytic muffler is a welcome addition to the diesel bus , the Transit Authority has ignored the application of fuel additives which have been successfully employed in Belgium to reduce diesel smoke and odors , The Transit Authority should start a program with available additives to select the best available . Additives can be used immediately and do not require any modification to the bus , as is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control which has been neglected by the Transit Authority is the miniaturized electrostatic precipitator , as recommended by the task force to trap particulate matter . I am pleased to note that the Transit Authority is not satisfied with the diesel exhaust situation . However , it should do much more than merely try to persuade bus manufacturers to improve their product . What the city needs is aggressive leadership in this area . ROBERT ALLEN FOX ' New York , Jan. 6 , 1967 The writer is a member of the City of New York 's Board of Air Pollution Control . Electric Car Use To the Editor : The electric car may soon become a reality , bringing relief to the lungs and spirits of New Yorkers . Would not this reality come sooner if the city and the auto industry were to cooperate on parking meter electric current for recharging , to increase the range , speed and thus the attractiveness of the car to industry and consumer alike ?
