Majority Leader Mike Mansfield , normally the mildest of men , was beside himself . " Outrageous ! " he stormed . " We are , by our accomplishments , making the Senate look ridiculous , picayune and incompetent to handle the business of the people . " The problem , really , was a lack of accomplishments . Repeatedly lacking a quorum , the upper chamber ground to a halt several times . At one point the Senate went into a 1-hour and 40-minute recess owing to what Mansfield testily termed " a complex development . " That development : Senator Allen Ellender 's 78th birthday , which he marked by whipping up his annual luncheon of Louisiana creole gumbo for Lady Bird Johnson , Lynda Johnson Robb and other noted local la dies . A minor piece of farm legislation was before the Senate , and it could not proceed without Agriculture Committee Chairman Ellender . <P> <P> Duty Bound . After repeated delays , the Senate finally took on the week 's principal business : President Johnson 's nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a filibuster will not come until this week , but it is foredoomed . Fortas ' opponents , led by Michigan Republican Robert Griffin , have considerably more than enough votes to block cloture and keep the talkathon going until the Administration gives up . <P> If there had been any doubt about Fortas ' fate , none remained after Minority Leader Everett Dirksen pulled a 180 switch and announced that he now felt " duty bound " to vote against cloture . Last summer Dirksen gave the President his approval of the appointment . But as opposition to Fortas swelled-22 of the Senate 's 37 Republicans are now against him-Dirksen 's leadership has grown shaky , and he is not unmindful that as a rambunctious Congressman in 1965 , Griffin helped turn aging Charles Halleck out of the House minority leadership . <P> Belated Advice . During the debate , the charges raised repeatedly against Fortas in Judiciary Committee hearings were aired anew . No one questioned his legal brilliance . Fortas ' opponents complained instead about his status as the appointee of a lame-duck President , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pornography and criminals . A typical objection came from Dirksen 's son-in-law , Tennessee Senator Howard Baker : " In continuing to counsel the President on such matters as the Viet Nam war , the riots , legislative proposals and the 1966 State of the Union address , Justice Fortas not only has committed a judicial impropriety but also has flagrantly violated the traditional separation-of-powers concept . " <P> Even Mansfield was less than ardent , though he favored confirmation . It was " unfortunate , " he said , that Fortas accepted $15,000 for 18 hours of lecturing this summer at Washington 's American University . " One would hope , " Mansfield added gently , " that Mr. Fortas no less than any of the other members of the Court would henceforth bear these distinctions in mind . " For Mr. Fortas , that advice may have come too late .
