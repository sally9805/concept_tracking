FOR weeks , Washington has been waiting for Lyndon Johnson to fill a looming vacancy on the seven-man Federal Reserve Board , expecting his choice to signal whether the board will stress easy or tighter money . Last week , Johnson took the trodden path : he reappointed James Louis Robertson , 56 , whose term officially expired in January , to another 14-year term as governor .

A Pennsylvania farm boy who was once a reporter for the Harrisburg Patriot , Cunningham started in a Kresge stock room 36 years ago , became chief executive in 1959 . He promptly replaced all its vice presidents with younger men , but kept up the firm 's traditions : no smoking or coffee drinking in the offices , men separated from women in the company cafeterias .
