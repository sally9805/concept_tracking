It has long been our annual custom to take a thorough look at the U.S. economy-its performance in the past year and what it is likely to do in the year ahead . In our shop phrase we call it " the year-end business review . " This week it takes the form of a cover story , written by Marshall Loeb and edited by Champ Clark , on one of the most astute money managers of our day . <P> Reviewing TIME 'S own experience in the past twelve months , we are happy to be able to say that it was an excellent year . Early in 1966 , our editorial staff gathered for a dinner at New York 's Plaza Hotel , largely to socialize but also to hear a progress report on TIME . " The recognition for what we do individually goes to the magazine as a whole , with its great success and impact , " said Managing Editor Otto Fuerbringer . So , without smugness , we take some satisfaction from the fact that financially this was our best in 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new buyers , bringing our worldwide circulation to 4,600,000 . Advertising sales for the U.S. edition topped $86 million , which places TIME second only to LIFE among all magazines in advertising revenue . To speed production and distribution , a sixth U.S. printing plant was added , in Atlanta , and in our New York offices we installed the first of two 360/30 IBM computer systems to accelerate the flow of copy . <P> What really matters , of course , is the contents of that copy . To this , our readers seemed to respond with gusto . The " Is God Dead ? " cover story drew a record-breaking 3,500 letters , and the vast majority answered the rhetorical question in a vigorous negative . We continued our broad coverage of the Vietnamese war , beginning with the Man of the Year cover story on General William Westmoreland . Also memorable , we feel , were our report on the South African situation , which featured Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd on the cover shortly before his assassination ; our tour of swinging London ; and the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new chancellor , Kurt Kiesinger . <P> Among other stories during the year that provoked especially heavy reader response were our selection of America 's best teachers ; the story and psychological analysis of the Texas mass murderer , Charles Whitman ; the cover story on Danny Escobedo and the drastic changes taking place in U.S. criminal law ; and the ode to middle age , starring Lauren Bacall . Essay moved into its second year with its usual catholicity of concern , ranging from today 's philosophers to suicide . This week the section salutes a new year by attempting a new device : an essay in play form , written by Stefan Kanfer . <P> So much for the past . We hope to make 1967 equally successful for TIME-and equally interesting for our readers .
