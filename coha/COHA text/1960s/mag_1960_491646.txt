The students , all twenty-five , eyed me with the curious intentness that freshmen usually focus on their first college teacher . Only I had forgotten about freshmen in the twenty years I had been away from college teaching . To me their eyes , so magnetized by wonder , were charged with criticism . Not for me as a teacher  --  they had no way of knowing my talents or limitations as a teacher , not even by hearsay  --  but for me as a human being . Or did I feel the unconscious guilt that Southerners are said to feel about the Negro race ? For I am a white woman , Southern-born , and my class was a class of Negro men , or rather I say it almost apologetically , having learned that certain words are taboo by my students  --  boys . But i am the mother of a teen-age son , and to me any male under twenty is inevitably a boy . The day was hot  --  early September is usually hot in Atlanta  --  and the big , barnlike " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable , for I had pulled down the shades and turned off the window fans to prepare for my first lecture , which would be illustrated by slides . The closeness of the room and the bright glare of the fluorescent lights suspended from the high wooden ceilingmade me acutely conscious of the united front ranged silently against me . Yet even then  --  for subsequently this fact has reinforced itself a hundred times upon my mind  --  I was aware of the diversity of types that composed the group . On the front row to my left sat a handsome , heavy-set , very black Negro boy . At the back of the room was a tall , thin lad whom under other circumstances I would have taken to be white . In between these two extremes were as many variations of skin coloring and ethnological types as one could imagine . But out of the mosaic of I - and I believe that most teachers have t , , perience with any new group of students  --  one impinged itself upon my mind . It was a block face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ilhilust like those of a price lighter whose opponeitt 's blows have hurt him . I wondered vaguely who he was and what a course in Humanities could possibly mean to him . Why was I here in this unpleasantly hot classroom at Morehouse ( .. 1/11. - one of live Negro colleges in Atlanta , ? taking up work that I had left behind Inc twenty years ago ? While I am a professor 's wife , and a professor 's salary can always bear supplementing , money was not the motivating force . It was after a conversation with one or my neighbors that it occurred to me that I might sec for myself what it was that made the idea of integrated schools so distasteful . While I knew that iny neighbor 's attitude was not the only one found in Atlanta  --  there are many " moderates " here as elsewhere  --  it is one that has a strong following among those who call themselves " real Southerners . " Her reasons for opposing integration were the usual ones : Negroes , with their poor backgrounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above them in training and aptitude ; white children would suffer by an inevitable lowering of standards ; social integration would follow school integration , with intermarriage the logical consequence . And , as though to drive her point home , she added , " How would you like your son to marry a Negro girl ? " I did not argue with her . In the first place , did I know that she was wrong in believing Negro children could not compete with white children , that standards would automatically be loin I by school integration ? I might have 14 ! ? .11 the subject , kised in reading , but as it : -. ; irkit hillier my life had I a peculiarly insulated from contact ? vith Ne , except in a domestic rehitionship . And what of this " mixing " of the races  --  not as it existed in slavery times , which was a different situation altogether  --  but between individuals with similar educational backgrounds and coinroon iliterests ? A teaching job seemed the best way to find out . A teacher may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learns something of the caliber of their minds and , if she is lucky , she gets to know a few students very well . 1 was not in a position to take a secondary-school position ; but I did have four years of college teaching to my credit , so it was to Dr. Benjamin Mays , president of Morehouse College , that I applied for a job . I had never met Doctor Mays , but I knew that he was avowedly in favor of integration and , after all , it has to work both ways . Since he happened to need an extra Humanities teacher , I became a member of the Morehouse faculty in the fall of 1958 . My first academic conference was with the dean , a tall , imposing man whose skin was nearly as light as mine . " Will my being white make any difference in the students ' attitude toward me ? " I asked , expecting a reassuring smile . He looked at me . " That depends on you , " he said . " It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added , a hard note in his voice , " if any of the students give you trouble send them to Inc . You 'll never have trouble front them again , I promise you . " The thought of having students I ' night have to expel from class was not a pleasarir one . And my students were all to be freshmen. just out of high school . Visions of The Blackboard jungle flashed through my mind . I wa , not sure what the dean 's conversation implied , but I left his office feeling slightly uncertain of myself . This explains , I suppose , my sense of relief when my first class was over and the students filed quietly out of the room . None lingered , even to ask a question or make an observation I was the first white teacher most of them had ever had , so in a way we were both beine tested . I hoped I had stood up as well as they As the days went by I ceased to worry about discipline problems . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to be thankful for iris students ' quiet acceptance of me as a teacher and wanted nothing so much as to break down the barrier of formality that held us apart . Even in private conferences my students retained a diffidence I had never known before I learned in time that this formality is one of the things that distinguishes the Negro student . It was not just with me that he was formal . He was the same with his Negro instructors or , for that matter , with his schoolmates if the occasion required it . Standing ; before the student body a Negro will wear dignity like an academic gown . I mentioned this once to an older student . " We are formal , " he said . " I was in a group with some white students the other night . The white boys got up and called their teammates ' Bill ' and ' Joe . ' But when I got up I had to say , ' My colleague , Mr. Jones . ' " I noticed this same outward display of dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was none of the sloppy casualness you see on many of the white Southern campuses . This dignified behavior is encouraged by Doctor Mays . He firmly believes in the Morehouse slogan , " Maker of Men . " The word " men " is not incidental It is one of the most important words in the Morehouse vocabulary . A student told me once , " After your first class some of your students said , ' She called us boys ! ' They did n't like it . I told them it wa ! just a matter of age , that you did n't mean , anything . " A few days later the significance of this was brought home to me when I was in the library entry talking to a student . A white man came in and , ignoring the young man at the desk by the door , asked me where an office was . Before I could answer , my student , an exuberant and not altogether tactful lad , spoke up . " Ask the boy at the desk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the visitor , then with a look of icy coolness came over to the student by my side and demanded an apology . His anger was so great that I thought briefly there was going to be a fight , Trivial ? From their point of view , no . As onL student put it , " In some Southern communitie , a Negro man is a boy until he 's sixty-five . After that he becomes ' uncle .

This took many more weeks , and his food supplies were running low  --  in the hurly-burly of the war in the Pacific it seemed that the Omuta Atoll was forgotten .

Then he was discosered , but he got away . Pepper knew the atoll , and the enemy did not . At List they starved him Out of hiding ; but just then our planes arrived  --  one of his messages had got through  --  and the submarine was captured . So Bob Pepper came home , shot to rags like a battle banner , and covered with medals ; old glory  --  and interestingly lean . The magazines bid high for The Sergeant Pepper Story , and a Hollywood company paid one hundred twenty thousand dollars for the motion-picture rights , even before he armed . His wife came to see me , twisting her handkerchief with nerves . " All the girls will be after him now , " she said , " and I 'm fat . Oh , Mr. Vara , will he still love me ' ?

Now , having recovered , he measured forty  --  thirty-eight  --  thirty-nine ; a good , solid figure of a man . " Better let me make you new suits , " I said . " I am tired of handling this stuff . " " Oh , there 's plenty of wear in them yet , " he said . He did not need to add that , with the income from his business and other enterprises , his earnings for that first postwar year would be assessed at about one hundred sixty thousand dollars , and that by the time the tax collectors were through with him , he would remember Omala with something like fond regret .

And she was jealous ; she had not bargained for a hero as a husband  --  a woman never sees a hero as a fat man  --  so she , having got plump , had to fatten him again in order to feel secure . I let out their scams , little by little , at the rate of about an inch a year . " I saw them last Sunday in the park . She is still remarkably pretty , and he is massive and contented , Next year I shall make him some more suits .

Morehouse students are " screened , " of course  --  as most college students are  --  but a comparison of Negro and white college freshmen must reveal a difference in their preparation and ability to absorb knowledge . When my first tests were turned in I was disappointed . Most of my students had not even the most rudimentary knowledge of geography or history or literature . Nor had they the language to express their ideas , if they had ideas . I let my husband read a few of their papers . " Do you remember , " he said , " that student of mine who wrote on a quiz that Henry she Eighth married a girl from Oregon ? Give them time . They ' II improve . " My husband , who is a professor of history at Emory University , was , of course , an old " pro " and knew college freshmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted to give reports , offered observations in class and sought conferences about their work . In these conferences I learned something of their high-school training . Most of it was poor . The students had been allowed to slide through with good grades and little work . Their teachers were of the type so often lamented by scholarsthes were burdened with " education " but with little knowledge of their subjects . The students realized only too well the gap between high school and college . By mid-year the poorest students had dropped out  --  they always do , anywhere . The remainder were working fairly well , and the few bright ones , who may initially have had the poorer preparation , were striding ahead . It was the old academic pattern . Many of the freshmen would never be graduated . I knew . Out of a class of 225 freshmen , only 100 would get degrees . This large attrition would be due to what my neighbor would call " background . " Morehouse is a private college , and one would expect the students there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In part this is true . A number come from professional families , and a few have had the experience of attending good Eastern preparatory schools . But many are on scholarships and come from small towns and country areas where the Negro has always been " kept in his place . " The feeling engendered by this kind of background is one that teachers at Morehouse seek to combat . Some of them have experienced the same kind of discipline themselves , so they know what it means , It is what makes integration so important to them . They believe the Negro youth can feel complete self-respect only when he is eiven a chance to compete equally with his white peers It is the same belief that W. L. DuBois , the famous Negro educator and writer , had in 1897 when he wrote , " That sky was bluest when I could beat my mates at examination time or beat them at a foot race . " They realize that the temptation to surrender the struggle for recognition , to fall into the easy groove of conformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students themselves . An article in the school paper last year decried the fact that college graduates would take menial jobs . The Southern Negro student 's background is underprivileged in other ways than psychologically , though it is hard to know how much his economic and social ills stem from the psychological factor . In the college there are a number of illegitimate boys . I do not know which ones they are , as this knowledge came from a faculty report . There are more , I am sure , than one finds in a comparable white college . There are also more students from broken homes . The pattern of marital instability , inherited from slavery conditions , still prevails in the South . Negro leaders know this and believe it is as much , or more , a matter of economics as of social tradition . I have students who have supported themselves almost since they can remember . I have others who have been passed from one relative to another for support . Many of these boys live under slum conditions in crowded houses or rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable white college either . The surprising thing is that they want an education at all and , in some cases , are willing to deprive themselves of necessities to get it . " What do your students major in ? " people have asked me . Where , in other words , do they believe their futures lie ? One day when I was talking to a boy who had spent the previous year in France I asked him what his major was . He had an unusually fine French accent and could speak French fluently , so I expected his answer to be " French . " " Psychology , " he said . I then discovered that , aside from the sciences , psychology and sociology were the favored fields at Morehouse . I asked an English professor about this . " It 's quite understandable , " he commented , " These boys are looking for answers , and those are the fields where they expect to find them . It 's really too bad . 1 have one student now who could do brilliantly in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro students are no longer inhibited  --  as were their grandparents  --  about discussing the Negro problem . They have seen laws passed in their favor , and their future looks hopeful . I asked a studeni one day how he would feel about having white boys at Morehouse . He shrugge , ' his shoulders . " A boy 's a boy . " This is the crux of their thinking . -A man 's a man for a ' that . " They do nor mind looking " different . " They do mind being different . I listened with considerable interest to a Morehouse student talk in chapel one day . Mr. Charles Merrill , son of Charles E. Merrill of the well-known investment brokerage Merrill Lynch , is the chairman of the board of trustees of Morehouse College , and head of the Commonwealth School , a coed preparatory school in Boston . He sends several outstanding students to Europe every year for study and travel . This student wa .. recounting some of his experiences . He told about an incident that took place high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen a Negro before began to scream at the top of his lungs at the sight of him . Even the parents ' explanation that " the young man has just had too much sun , " did not pacify him . The Negro youth thought the situation highly amusing , as did the students listening to him . They could understand the child 's reaction . There is a difference between being " different " in outward appearance and being inferior because your skin happens to be a different color . This same young man told of anoths " experience . In Ireland . he said , the natives expressed great sympathy for the Negroes in the South because they were treated as the English had treated them . the Irish . " They called it sympathy , " the Negro said a little resentfully , " but it was pity . I do n't want pity . " Yet few of the students at Morehouse whom t have talked to wish to leave the South . At first this struck me as odd . But they believe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in the South . t know of one youth who was given a good scholarship to attend a college in Ohio , but he was reluctant to take it . " Why should I go up North when so much is happening in the South ? " he said . The pattern in New York , Chicago and other cities with large Negro populations is fixed . But if the South can be won  --  and they believe it cars  --  their national role will be a better one . Though he may wish III slay in the South , the young Negro wants to avoid the small town . One of my students said to me one day , " I 'll never live in a town of less than fifty thousand . " " Why ? " I asked . " In the town I come from , " he said , two of people who get " there ore Li ; d of respect . The minister and the teacher . l 'm not going to be either . I want to take 11 business job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still be somebody . " The inconsistency of segregation strikes the Negro student us absurd . When the ruling on the desegregation of buses in Atlanta was made , the editor and another staff member of the Morehouse school paper decided they would travel around the city by bus and see how it was working . All went well until at one stop the bus driver refused to let the boys out the front door . When they refused to go to the rear , he sat tight with the door closed , though an impatient crowd of white people were waiting to get on . When the people began to pound on the door angrily  --  it was about five o'clock and they were eager to get home  --  he threw up his hands and let the boys out , saying sulkily to the passengers , " I was just trying to keep those niggers from going out the front . " Nobody was interested . Segregation that interfered with their comfort was not worth observing . Another more obvious inconsistency was brought home to Morehouse students recently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the country 's large scientific foundations , was a personal guest of President Eisenhower at the State dinner he gave for Mr. Khrushchev . Yet this same individual may not  --  by law  --  use the same washroom as the lowest white man in the city of Atlanta . Negro students are aware also that the South . in part , has already been won . Some of them participate regularly in interracial and international meetings where color is no barrier to equality . These are sponsored by religious and civic groups . In these meetings white and Negro students discuss problems that confront them as world citizens . Most of their meetings have to be held at one of the Negro colleges , of course , for no white dining room will serve a Negro student . Other meetings take place in private homes . The informal , friendly atmosphere of a living room is even more conducive to mutual understanding . In this atmosphere I have seen a young Negro and a white boy , both from the same Georgia coastal town , meet a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the evening was over these two young people were viewing each other with mutual respect and liking , forgetful of any color barrier that may have previously existed . Once I was present when a white Southern youth sat listening to a Negro professor discuss modern poetry . 1 do not suppose it had ever occurred to this boy that a Negro could be as urbane , perceptive or intelligent as this Negro Harvard graduate . After an evening ! Ike that it is difficult to see how segregation could ever have quite the same meaning . What about my own position in a city that still observes segregation ? Am I shunned by my friends , excoriated as a traitor to the Southern " cause " ? While a number of people I know do not heartily approve of my teaching in a Negro college , I have never had an unpleasant word spoken to me about it . Nor have I reason to think that I am a social outcast . Perhaps the winds of freedom blow stronger in our country than Little Rock and Clinton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southerners merely look thoughtful when I talk to them about my work , But I do not talk about it unless I am asked , I could wish that many of my Southern friends might know my colleagues , for like the boy from the coastal town they would see iniegi anon in a new light . But I can understand why they feel as they do , having been In ought up under the aegis of segregation . The idea that was fixed in their childhood has never been dislodged . Sometimes I am " explained " by my friends . A man told me last year at a dinner party that he could understand how I felt because I was from New Orleans . " It 's the French influence , " he said . eying me quite seriously , I am not French , of course , nor am I even of Creole descent . What is more , I do not think that New Orleans Creoles are by nature any more liberal than other Southerners . Sometimes people " explain " themselves to me . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with pride , as though they and I were from different lands . And I understand . They do not hold with slavery , they want the Negro to have a chance , hut  --  again the fixed idea . What about my relations to my Negro colleagues ? Am I accepted by them ? The question is not easily answered . On the campus I think I arn . I am not the only white person on the faculty . This year in a faculty of forty-three there are three other full-time white women , as well as four white men . One of the women is an Austrian , another a Hungarian , the third is from California . None of the three was born in the South and hence accustomed from birth to the peculiar cast of thought that is called " Southern . " As for being accepted socially , I am not sure . We and the Negroes both recognize , though it is unsaid that our worlds are still segregated , that our meetings . ire necessarily restricted by laws that make it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , to expect to be " taken in " by everyone . Things just do not operate that way , even in a white community . You select your friends and they select you on the basis of compatibility . I have been invited to the homes of a few of my colleagues and I have entertained some of them . There is not , however . the easy camaraderie that one could wish for . Invariably the conversation veers round to segregation It is the specter at our feast . It is rather difficult to retain a completely happy outlook when you associate , as I do , with people who are discriminated against by your fellow men . You tend to feel discriminated against yourself , because you identify somehow with them . I have tried to avoid this feeling . I often think of that student in my first class , the one with lowered brow . I remind myself how easy it was to see him as the defiant , unpleasant unthoughtful person he appeared to me that day . It took me several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person but had one of the most artistic . sensitive and intelligent minds I have encountered . We are all guilty of wrong judgments . It is difficult in a large class to assess each student for what he really is . It is even more difficult to assess people you do not know . You must probe below the surface to find Out what it is that gives a man individuality , that makes him " different . " During my year and a half at Morehouse I have learned the difference between black and white . It is the difference that exists between black and black or white and white . The difference , basically , between man and man ,
