WEST Berliners resemble the peasants who live on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius . They are not easily frightened by international rumblings , sulphuric diatribes , or the hot-lava flow of Communist threats . Though their city is split in two , though they are completely surrounded by Communist territory . West Berliners view the situation calmly and glory in the nickname Insulaner-islanders . <P> Sweltering Day . Some 500 streets are sealed off in police-guarded dead ends , often with two West German policemen on one side , six East German policemen on the other . Streetcars and buses come to abrupt stops , and only subways and elevated trains run unhampered throughout the city . If a boy in West Berlin wants to phone a girl in East Berlin , the call must be routed via Frankfurt ( West Germany ) and Leipzig-a distance of more than 500 miles to make a phone ring in the next block . There are no country weekends for West Berliners , since the countryside is Communist . The most popular and convenient vacation spot is nearby Lake Wannsee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweltering day in August . <P> Eighteen months ago there were signs that the volcano was about to erupt.Russia 's Nikita Khrushchev abruptly issued an ultimatum demanding that Western troops be evacuated from Berlin and that the city 's links with West Germany be severed . But despite Khrushchev 's threats , 1959 represented the best business year ever , and industrial production in the first quarter of 1960 is an impressive 14% above last year . The West Berlin government pressed ahead with supplementary stockpiling until now the city can subsist normally for six months without outside supplies.Berliners know that no limited cutoff of traffic by the Communists can starve them out . Said a businessman : " Now it will take deeds , not words , to really shake us . " <P> Khrushchev 's proposal to make West Berlin a " free city , " embedded in East Germany and cut off from the West , has had another result : the Insulaner have stopped grumbling about their lot and decided that the status quo is not so bad after all . The currently favorite illustration of Khrushchev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the edge of a cliff . Says the first : " We 'll compromise . Let 's both take one step backward . " <P> The young admire and support their elders ' determination . But they see no future for themselves in a beleaguered city and most of them try their fortunes in West Germany . West Berlin is an aging city-more than half of its 2,200,000 inhabitants are now over 45 . Contrasts are omnipresent : a fashion show may be held in the striated shadow of the bombed-out remains of the Anhalter Station . <P> Returning Natives . While the gales of power politics howl over its head , Berlin goes about its business . By day , the streets are crowded with shoppers ; the city 's score of electrotechnical plants belch smoke against the Prussian-blue sky ; workmen scramble over scaffolding of a $900,000 British-American cigarette factory , the newest plant in the city . With a labor force of nearly a million and only 36,000 unemployed ( matching the alltime low of last September ) , West Berlin can boast that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
