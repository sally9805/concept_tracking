" I 'm really ashamed of editorial cartooning in America . " says Paul Conrad . " There are over 150 cartoonists , but you can count the good ones on the fingers of one hand . " <P> On anyone 's hand Paul Conrad , 35 , editorial cartoonist of the Denver Post , counts as one of the fingered few , and is probably the nation 's hottest new cartooning property . He has already been given a semiofficial anointment as the heir apparent to the Washington Post and Times Herald 's brilliant and club-wielding Herbert Block ( " Herblock " ) . Since January , a Conrad cartoon has gone out each week , together with five Herblocks , to the 200 newspapers in Herblock 's syndication . <P> No Talking Balloons . But Conrad is far different from Herblock . His cartoons are no fast-swept , brutal assaults . Conrad combines meticulous attention to detail with the powerful punch of simplicity . Hours of painstaking research go into a Conrad cartoon , with the result that a Conrad locomotive , for example , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any engineer . A Conrad cartoon is readily digested at a glance . That glance , he feels certain , is all the reader will give it : " I figure eight seconds is the absolute maximum time anyone should have . " Talking balloons almost never drift above the heads of his characters , who are generally so identifiable that they need no name tags ; his captions are either commendably short or absent altogether . <P> Although he was born and raised a Republican , Conrad 's personal enthusiasms are presently those of an Adlai Stevenson Democrat . He voted for Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 , has since made Ike appear as a progressively older and near-senile sort . Admonished by his editors , Conrad replies : " I consulted a doctor . He said that it 's perfectly logical for a man 's appearance to change that way as he grows older . " Besides , says Conrad , " the way I draw him , he is perfectly recognizable . " Conrad can make Republican Richard Nixon look ridiculous without making him a Herblock subspecies . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hilarious Mona Lisa . <P> " Stay Mad . " Says the Post 's Managing Editor Robert Lucas of Conrad : " Paul 's always been admonished to be fair in what he says , and not to get typed as hard left or hard right . " Within that limitation , Conrad does pretty much as he pleases , and does not care for cartoon suggestions from his bosses . <P> Conrad 's success is in no small part due to his own carefully considered ideas about his techniques-and the limitations of his craft . Says he : " You should always determine first what you want to say . It 's a bad situation for a cartoonist to think of his pictures first . " He also says : " A cartoonist should get out of bed mad and stay mad . The cartoonist 's function is essentially a negative one , and the cartoon that advocates something usually says nothing .
