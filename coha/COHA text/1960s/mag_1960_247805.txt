( See Cover ) <P> The cluster of green , sugarloaf islands huddles close to the China coast . As the jet airliner glides in , sunlight reflects from the rippled sea , the brown batwing sails of Chinese junks turn in the wind . The travelers look down on rocky hills with terraced fields , deeply indented coves alive with sampans , a wide harbor carrying a honking traffic of freighters , tugs , barges and ferries . <P> <P> The jet swoops past the great city rising from the water 's edge toward the towering Peak-shipyards , smoking factories , villas drowned in gardens , balconied tenements , squatters ' huts clinging to bare rock , bright new skyscrapers still wrapped in bamboo scaffolding . Coming in low over rooftops fluttering with blue and white laundry , the jet roars down upon the 8,000-foot runway of Kai Tak Airport . Thus , last week , another planeload of tourists landed amid the sights , sounds , smells and bracing excitement of Hong Kong . <P> Danger Zones . The jet age has narrowed the vast Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served by 1,000 flights a month , is 14 hours from San Francisco , only 18 hours over the North Pole from New York City . The Far East used to be the domain of the reckless adventurer or the traveler who could afford the money and leisure for a two-month cruise . Now Tokyo , Bangkok and Hong Kong are as accessible as Paris , Rome or London . Ten thousand tourists a week pour into the Orient , and many , traveling economy class , pay as little as $1,500 round trip . <P> Travel in Europe follows well-worn paths in and out of cathedrals , galleries , great museums and famous restaurants . The U.S. visitor is culturally never very far from home . But the Far East is a plunge into the strange and unfamiliar . Music suddenly becomes an atonal screeching ; men bow instead of shaking hands , sit cross-legged on the floor to eat dinner and mostly wear twisted cloths or even skirts instead of trousers . The straight lines of Western architecture are replaced by curlicues and curves ; landscapes become shrouded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And poverty is not a shabby destitution but something as stark , as cruel and as immediate as death . <P> Different Faces . The Far East has nearly as many different faces as it has gods . Some tourists try to capture its flavor by slipping into Japanese kimonos and sleeping on the tatami floors of Kyoto inns , where Kannon , the goddess of mercy , dreams among the maple trees . They go as pilgrims to the Great Buddha of Nakamura or , if they get as far as Southeast Asia , stand in awed silence at Angkor , whose 40 square miles of ruins in the Cambodian jungle are about all that remain of the ancient 8th to 11th century Khmer civilization . <P>
