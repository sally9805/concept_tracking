 | D-Day Plus 20 Years IF YOU went back it would n't set the memories straight : that was a different world , and its landmarks are not in Normandy . Today , there is nothing in Normandy to show where you stood on the beach in the gray vacuum and waited . There is nothing out in the waves where the shells were bursting , no landing craft that drifts and wallows with the rest of your company aboard . There is nothing now to mark the place you jumped ashore , just as it slewed and drifted away , nothing to mark the strip of wet sand where , waiting , you stood and talked to the oldish , unconcerned captain you had never seen before . Nothing tells you where the two of you , with no logical purpose , pulled ashore the corporal with the back of his head blown off . The corpses and the vacuum have gone ? and they were the things , that day . The vacuum was gray and personal , gray and menacing , gray and protective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the old meanings . It screeched new meanings at you , thin and final . But it would not let you look ahead more @#  | than a few minutes or at most a day ; and as you chatted with the oldish captain it held you away from the keen edge of reality , from your first angry bullets and mortar bombs . You do not think they were the first for the captain : he was inside the vacuum for a while , and you understood each other . At the time , of course , you did not understand about the vacuum ; that came later , with the memories . Today , there is nothing in Normandy to tell you where your landing craft grounded again , nothing to show Harry Martin 's shell-splintered cheek already swelling under the first-aid dressing . Nothing marks that patch of trampled sand near the wire where Sergeant Voekel sprawled , one hand on a red thigh , face white and trying to grin . Nothing marks the gap in the wire ? with Bill Kent staggering through , arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming down from the bandage that covered his eyes . The wire , you remember , marked a boundary of the grayness ; if you passed it , there would be a difference . At least , memory tells you so . But perhaps you did not know that at the time , either . And then you were through the gap and beyond the wire . There was a tank there , its strange waterproof apron indecently lifted , and you began to learn the difference between the crack of a gun and the trump of a shell . And then you were all streaming across the marsh past the black minen signs ( or were they red ? or was it blue ? ) . There beyond the wire it was different all right : freer , and with more possibilities . You could see far across the open marsh , with mortar bombs exploding in high , safe mushrooms . There was still the grayness , and in those five rushed miles to the bridge the thin new meanings began to take on shapes they 'd always hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings striped black and white . The sun broke through , and a clump of trees stood tall and straight and graceful and above it all . Then Joe Thorndike was down , breathing hard , face pale , redness seeping onto torn fabric over his chest , and you had to leave him H3  | there on the wet grass . ( But was his name Thorndike ? Twenty years , and the sound has blurred . ) You took cover under a bank at the marsh 's edge and the little gray grenade came lobbing over and you all threw yourselves flat and the grenade went off with a humorously ineffective pop ; and then the figure came unexpectedly over the bank to see what had happened , and the face above the field-gray tunic was young and surprised . Off to the right , a rangy lieutenant raced long-legged through a smoke screen and then came back , and you still remember how he shone with the joy of battle ? with the exultation that was always natural and magnificent when it was on you , always uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now , in Normandy , there is only the flat , gray-green marsh . At the bridge , it might be different . There , you could pick out the grassy bank where you mounted your machine guns for the attack on the pillbox . And the cafe would still be there , with the effusive little Frenchman standing outside and admiring the war , the cafe into which you went after the pillbox fell and saw your colonel lying with a bullet through his knee . And he looked up at you and said , " Well , you seem to be enjoying yourself anyway . " And you discovered to your surprise , when you stopped to look at yourself , that he was right . Of course , you did n't stop to look at yourself then . That did n't come for years . You , were young , and there was no time ' to stop and look at yourself . Damn it , there was a war on and it was n't your business to stop and think about why you did things or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men stopped to think ; and you feel humble . For you who did not think , it was all simple and fairly easy . For them , it must have been different . Beyond the bridge there 'd be more guides for memory . But the village would not mean the same thing . ' without its reek of death , or the farm without the four up-sticking legs o that bloated and stinking cow under , the archway . The smells can not have been there on the day , but that 's how you remember it now , from the days that followed . The slit trenches would all be gone , too , and you would n't know where it was that you leaped for one in the darkness as the plane began to dive , and found yourself scrabbling senselessly downward with bare fingers as the whole world ripped apart . ( In the morning , you counted 15 little craters within ro paces ? or was it to craters within 15 paces ? ) But when you stop to think you know that that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day either . Twenty years , and the memories have shifted . Now  | You remember not just the day itself ut the things it stood for , the world it broke open . You remember the evening of the day in that pretty little glade , with mortar bombs tearing earth and flesh apart ; and you remember seeing Sam and Harvey there , with faces already older . But you can not remember the glade now without remembering the morning , almost a year later , when you sat with Sam and Harvey around a howl of eggs that the frightened German farmwife had brought . Spring sunshine streamed through the shattered window behind Sam 's head , and the three of you laughed as you ate the eggs . And you can not remember that morning without remembering the day , a week later , that you passed Sam on the riverhank ; he was kneeling ? like a stiff , unnatural statue ? and for a moment you looked down into dark , clotted redness where the bullet had ripped his scalp away . Another week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then was silent . When Harvey died , the war was almost over . You knew the waste of it then . And on the last day of all you stood and watched the German pilot hail out of his smoking plane and plunge down with unopened parachute ; and although you can not remember now if you actually heard the thud as he landed , you can still hear it , and it makes even less sense . On the day , the first day , you knew none of these things ; but it was the beginning of them . The beginning of the gray vacuum that was always there when you looked back , the beginning of the savage exultation you had seen in the long-legged lieutenant , and the colonel had seen in you . The beginning of tiredness and fear , the beginning of defeating fear and ignoring death . The beginning of war 's confusion . The first confusion of the day has gone . The chessplayers soon tidied it up ? sorting out thrust and parried counterthrust , pivot and breaking point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meanings are more confused . You know now that the day was a tension point in your life ? because you lived rather than died , because between sunrise and sunset one small sector of you grew up . And you can still see , although you saw it differently then , that it was a historic day . But it still does n't make much sense , not down at the roots . Not the courage or the cowardice , not the grayness or the glory . They 're all there now , safely that , it still does n't make much sense . And yet , when it was all over , peace left you momentarily lost and aimless . You were a ship running for port , and the port gone . So , it must have made some kind of sense ? that world of new , thin meanings that broke open when you stood waiting on the beach in the gray vacuum and talked to the oldish captain . It must have made some kind of sense at the time . You ca n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
