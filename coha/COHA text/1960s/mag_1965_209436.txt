THE MAN WHO ROBBED THE ROBBER BARONS by Andy Logan . 260 pages . Norton $4.75 . <P> " New York society , " declared Colonel William d'Alton Mann , " is inhabited by jackasses , libertines and parvenus . " Not that he minded . For one thing , they made sensational copy for his scurrilous , scandalous Town Topics . For another , the publicity-shy Four Hundred provided him with a lucrative sideline : Publisher Mann was the nation 's most notorious blackmailer . He was also a Civil War hero , a talented inventor and a bon vivant . Nearly forgotten since his death in 1920 , he re-emerges in this witty , engaging biography by The New Yorker 's Andy Logan as a prize addition to the gang of robber barons . <P> Mann looked like a nightmare version of Santa Claus : a mop of white hair , a red , emphatic nose , and a tangle of untamed whiskers that parted beneath his chin . He also had the noisy energy of a stern-wheeler and the predacity of a buccaneer . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left home at 16 to be educated as a civil engineer , turned up again at 20 as manager of a dilapidated hotel in Grafton , Ohio , left town trailing a cloud of debts . In the confusion of wartime mobilization , he was made a colonel at 23 , organized the 7th Michigan Cavalry , later fought heroically under General Custer at Gettysburg . <P> After the war , the colonel really began to find his footing . Armed with a suitcase full of promotional handbills and a bottle of lubricating oil , he sold $57,500 worth of stock in a nonexistent oil well . The shareholders finally caught on , and Mann was brought to trial ; but the judge dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction . Encouraged , Mann packed his carpetbag in 1866 and moved on to Mobile as Federal Assessor of Internal Revenue . In 1872 he patented a design for a railroad sleeping car ( consisting of a series of stateroomlike compartments ) and sailed for Europe . There he leased his cars to rail lines in half a dozen countries . Eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a millionaire , to compete with George Pullman for the American market . Pull man won , and Mann went bankrupt . But not for long . By 1891 he had acquired full control of Town Topics from his young brother Eugene . <P> The Buyers . Half the magazine was given over to fiction , light verse and criticism . The rest was primarily the colonel 's own leering , impertinent gossip . ( " Mr. Henry Sloane has been looked upon as a complacent husband who wore his horns too publicly . " " Miss Van Alen suffers from some kind of throat trouble-she can not go more than half an hour without a drink . " ) <P> Everybody talked about Mann , but nobody dared do anything , since his facts were unerringly accurate . Mann had his price but he rarely used direct blackmail . Instead he " sold " his victims advertising in Town Topics , stock in his corporation ( which never paid a dividend ) , or subscriptions to his Fads and Fancies of Representative-Americans , the colonel 's hypocritical who 's who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. P. Morgan , Mrs. Collis Huntington , Clarence Mackay , three Vanderbilts and scores of others . <P>
