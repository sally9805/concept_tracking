Verse is not the usual medium through which Russia 's masters express themselves , but last week an obvious political hint was to be found in a poem . <P> Some Westerners believe that things must be made " easier " for Khrushchev by the West if he is not to fall prey to neo-Stalinist reactionaries . Moscow often seems eager to encourage this view , even though officially it has pronounced Stalinism as dead as Old Joe himself . Since early this year , Poet Evgeny Evtushenko ( TIME cover , April 13 ) , most popular spokesman of Russia 's restive younger generation , has recited for trusted friends an eloquent , venomous attack on Stalinism that he considered too hot to publish . For a while , the poem circulated through Russia 's mysterious poetic underground , until last week it was printed in full by the party newspaper Pravda . For whatever purpose , the party evidently wanted to suggest that Stalinism still exists , and that Khrushchev is its enemy . <P> According to the poem , Stalin is only pretending to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I envisage a phone " whose wires lead to Albania 's Strongman Enver Hoxha . In a clear allusion to Rose-Fancier Vyacheslav Molotov , the poem says that some of Stalin 's other heirs " prune roses in retirement , and secretly consider retirement only temporary . " Some secret Stalinists " curse Stalin from the podium ; but then , by night , they long for the old days . " To foil their ambitions , Evtushenko pleads : <P> Double , no , treble the guard by his slab To keep Stalin from rising , and with Stalin the past . <P> No , Stalin has not surrendered . He thinks death can be repaired . The Communist youth paper Komsomolskaya Pravda last week gave over a page to eight additional Evtushenko poems , including another anti-Stalinist tirade . By week 's end , slightly dazed Russian readers found still another Evtushenko work , this one contributed from Havana , where he is writing the scenario for a movie about Castro 's revolution . Couched in the form of a Letter to America , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but courageous island which is becoming a great country . " The U.S. , charged Evtushenko , first forced the Cubans to arm by threatening their independence , and then sanctimoniously accused them of having arms . Cried he : <P> How could you , America , Permit the shouting from tribunes high Of words that do shame to liberty ? <P> Pravda reported that Letter to America had been phoned in by the poet from Cuba . Evidently , like Stalin in his grave , Evtushenko has a telephone-but his is securely connected with the party line .
