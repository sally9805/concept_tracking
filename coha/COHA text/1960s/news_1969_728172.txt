txt The yellowish pledge cards have been dropped on hundreds of thousands of desks , and on the painted thermometer chart the mercury is rising as quotas are filled . At downtown luncheons there is hearty applause as corporate gifts are announced , and in the suburbs the matrons are knocking at doors and the familiar " He gave at the office " is heard through the land . The United Funds or Community Chests are collecting again , up to $800-million in the United States by the end of 1969 . But there are a few new indications this year , not yet prominent but hints , at least , of discontent with institutional charity in America . That familiar word , " relevant , " is bouncing around . There are questions from both blacks and whites about priorities and leadership . Is too much being funneled into white , middle-class institutions like the Boy Scouts rather than into solving the basic problems of the ghetto ? Must the organizations almost always be dominated by the rich or wellborn or labor leaders with minimum possible participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nothing compared with the attacks on other American institutions like the schools and the military , hardly enough to hurt contributions or make many headlines . But all such attacks have started slowly , and leaders of charity organizations are beginning to take notice . One of them is Joseph Hudson , the young head of Detroit 's leading department store , who led the city 's Urban Coalition and now chairs a committee set up to study the local fund 's priorities . " In a nutshell , " he said recently , " what we 'll be doing is determining the relevancy and effectiveness of the goals today , for today 's problems . " For example , he said , the committee will try to judge whether narcotics treatment , youth counseling and family planning are being shortchanged for the more traditional aid approaches to the blind , deaf and crippled . Another concerned charity official is Harry Brohen of New York , public relations director of the United Community Funds and Councils of America , a national association . " We have to make our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If we do n't , we 're going to become unneeded . " And still another is Arthur Greenleigh of New York , a consultant who surveyed charity drives in Detroit , Omaha and Santa Clara , Calif . He said that there must be more democracy , more coordination with public programs and more planning " related to the newer developments , " like manpower training and health programs . Criticism of the fund campaigns comes from many quarters . In Kansas City , Henry Finley , a Black Panther captain , complains that " the money is going for things like little white Girl Scouts and not to the homes for Negro orphans . " In Boston , Melvin King , executive director of the Urban League , protests that blacks " have no say in the way their money is spent . " The league has withdrawn from the United Community Service , the principal funnel for the United Fund there . In Pittsburgh , the head of a black United Fund agency says : " Some blacks are asking for more pressure on U.F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red feather agencies . The U.F. needs to be attacked , to be reassessed . Some blacks mention substantial money goes to Boy Scouts but there are few black Boy Scouts . " In Washington , the black United Fund ** that the charity fund is white-oriented , with no relevance to the inner city . In Cleveland , the welfare rights organization , its money request turned down , asserts that ? tl-xe poor receive little money from the fund . Roldo Bartimole , publisher of a newsletter , says : " The Red Cross , the Y.M.C.A. , the Jewish Welfare Federation get the bulk of the money . The old established agencies get it , and they get the same amounts whether they deal with problems that are critical today or not . " Such is the criticism . Just as many cities reported no such complaints . A certain amount of criticism of any organized effort can be expected nowadays . Still , resentment is evident . The comments of a prominent Black Detroiter exemplify the difficulties of criticizing programs that are generally conceded to be efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spirit of complete disillusion with everything but the Mets , " he said at first . But a moment later he was talking about the " sameness , " the same people on the boards of the United Foundation and the local United Community Services , which distributes most of the money , and of " almost complete suburban controls , " and " services rendered by and C .. - suburbanites " - with money help going only to " the most uncontroversial things in the world , health and welfare , with nothing for things such as housing , education , employment , the nuts and bolts of urban living . " This Detroiter relayed a story told him by his wife . " She was in the A &; P , and the black checkout girls were talking about it . One said , ' I had to give $2 to the U.F. and it 's the last time I 'm going to . ' Well , another girl said she gave $15 to the U.F. and the first girl said . ' What did you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply was , ' They got a $375 brace for my boy , and I 'd give more if I could . ' " Despite the newer complaints , this man said , the old pull to help the crippled child still is powerful . To meet the criticism , the Detroit United Community Services , which distributes about 60 per cent of the money collected by the United Foundation here , is revamping its structure . In place of a self-perpetuating board , a 150-to-240-member assembly , including representatives of the young , the old and the needy , will be set up to pick future directors . With the study of priorities under way , " we might be able to gear-in to the desires and aspirations " of those for whom the services are rendered , not just " what we want , " said Richard Huegli , executive vice president of the Detroit U.C.S. The United Community Funds and Council of America notes some new inner-city action ' around the country . In Honolulu , there is an emergency clinic for teen-age drug users supported by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500,000 to finance an emergency fund for innercity problems . Still , the bulk of the money certainly goes to the traditional organizations . In Detroit , for example , of $29-million raised last year about half went into such efforts as the Red Cross , Scouting , Jewish and Catholic Charities , the Young Men 's Christian Association , the Salvation Army , the Cancer and Heart funds . In addition , there are the costs of administration , which range from 4 per cent to 10 per cent , considerably less , fund officials say , than the 25 per cent to 35 per cent over- ' costs of independent charity campaigns . But then the bulk of the money is also collected from those interested in such funds . Half Detroit 's United Foundation money comes from whitecollar workers who give at the office ; one-fourth comes from factory workers , one-fifth from business . " If you give money to welfare mothers , " said one Detroit housewife wryly , " there wo n't be any left for anyone else , because no one 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scouts , the Red Cross , the religious groups and agencies that help the crippled children , have fund-raising appeals of their own , and without them the united appeals would lose their purpose  --  they would n't be united . This year Detroit 's fund , the largest in the nation , seeks $29-million and will probably collect $31-million in a 23-day drive ending next Thursday . Hoopla is always a part of the massive giving . Each day some notable , like Gail Smith , a General Motors executive , will stand before the TV camera and show the collection total climbing . Trying to win over the younger workers , Detroit 's slogan this year is " We 're Ail We 've Got , " and a snappy rock song has been written ? and played often  --  emphasizing the help needed in the inner city . To raise the $29-million , industry , labor and a volunteer force of 50,000 have been mobilized . The door-to-door campaigning is kept up , not so much because of the $1-million it brings in as " because it is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity director . " Fifty thousand women , going ( door-to-door , that 's the difference , between us and the I.R.S. " And there is probably nothing else in the world like the voluntary efforts of American charity raisers . " I 've been at this for 10 years , " said Mrs. Nancy Bisaillon , a pretty 31-year-old blonde who wears short skirts and above-the-knee black boots as she makes her house rounds in suburban Bloomfield Hills , home of some of America 's richest businessmen . " My husband gives and I 'm in a hurry , " said one matron leaping into her station wagon and roaring away from her $100,000 home , leaving Mrs. Bisaillon empty-handed . " Honey , get your checkbook out , " another man called to his wife when Mrs. Bisaillon appeared at the door . After 15 minutes or so of chitchat , a $10 check was produced . " Last year we collected $2 , - 248 from 74 people , and this , year we 've got $500 or $600 more , " she said . " One man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After an hour and a half of , doorbell ringing on a brisk fall ' afternoon , Mrs. Bisaillon had $25 more to add to the fund total . She does not mind giving the time . " I think it 's for a worthy cause , and I enjoy . doing extracurricular things , she said . The ' racial question has al- , ways been touchy at the United ' Foundation here , and probably in other cities . Last year for the first time a Negro child appeared with whites on the formal Detroit campaign poster . And around the country there have been a few signs of backlash  --  in Philadelphia earlier in the year police threatened to withdraw their support to the local campaign , charging that some money was going to the Legal Aid Society , which , they said , harassed police . The conflict was apparently resolved , but fund officials say that it had an impact on the campaign and the $20-million goal may not be reached this year . In Dallas , the police complained that the Urban League was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . There also are usually complaints about the pressures to give , and there is no doubt that pressures , at least indirect , exist in most organizations . Some of the criticism about the direction of the funds may be because the funds are ac'tually donor-directed efforts , an attempt by the big-money givers to simplify their lives and eliminate the multiplicity of campaigns . This , in turn , keeps collection overhead down and produces more money for charitable efforts . There are 2,250 United Funds around the country , with 18 neillion volunteers and 33 million contributors , the national association says . The modern concept was born in Detroit in 1949 , largely through the efforts of Henry Ford 2d . At that time there were at least 50 annual solicitations on the streets , in factories or at homes , and employers were getting as many as 134 requests for plant soliciting , corporate gifts , or both . Big national groups such as the Red Cross or the American Cancer Society generally oppose united giving , but in many ( cases , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in , often under piessure . This year in New York City , for the first time , the Red Cross has joined the United Fund effort .
