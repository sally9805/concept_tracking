THE WHITE HOUSE <P> Standing in Dallas ' Parkland Memorial Hospital on that unforgettable afternoon five years ago last week , Lady Bird Johnson , numb with sorrow and shock , turned to Mrs. John Connally and whispered : " Oh , Nellie , I feel that I am onstage for a part I never rehearsed . " The First Lady learned her lines quickly . While her husband was al most constantly under fire , Lady Bird rarely became a target - except , perhaps , for cracks about her babyhood nickname and her Texas drawl . When the John sons had the Nixons to lunch at the White House just after the election , Pat Nixon told Lady Bird : " I 've been many places , and I 've heard nothing but admiration for you . " She added with a smile : " And I 've been places where I might have heard otherwise . " <P> Wherever those places are , Lady Bird has probably been there herself . Though she never gained the reputation that Eleanor Roosevelt had for popping up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and abroad in five years as First Lady . This week she is completing a final coast-to-coast trip covering 6,071 miles in 96 hours , taking her to New Orleans , Cape Kennedy and the California redwood forests . Before leaving , she welcomed 54 new U.S. citizens in the first naturalization ceremony ever held in the White House . The group ranged from an eight-year-old Filipino girl to a 72-year-old Chinese laundry worker . She told them warmly : " We need you all . " <P> At Lady Bird 's instance , the White House in the Johnson years was a casual home rather than a formal castle . <P> By the time they leave Washington , the Johnsons will have entertained 200 state visitors , more than any other Administration . A shrewd businesswoman , Mrs. Johnson also brought to such events a notable warmth . On one memorable occasion , her calm dignity soothed a White House women 's gathering after Eartha Kitt delivered a bitter anti-Administration protest . Elaborate state dinners often wound up with the liveliest late-hour dancing in official memory . What with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luci Nugent , and then the birth of Grandchildren Lyn and Lucinda , the family quarters and public rooms have rarely had such a workout . <P> <P> The First Lady will doubtless be best remembered for her wide-ranging efforts to beautify the U.S. While her anti-billboard campaign fizzled , her tree plantings and her continual calls for more parks and better playgrounds have made many Americans more thoughtful about the quality of their environment . Lyndon Johnson once complained , tongue in cheek : " Sometimes I 'm interrupted in my nap by Lady Bird and Laurance Rockefeller and about 80 others in the next room talking about flowers and roadside picnic tables . " <P> First of Many . In her travels as First Lady , Mrs. Johnson has aimed to " pull back the curtain " by publicizing little-known community programs for self-help and improvement around the U.S. Some think she did all that - and more .
