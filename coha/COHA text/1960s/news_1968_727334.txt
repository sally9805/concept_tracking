txt Organized labor here , eager to show its unity and strength in a political year , rallied the faithful yesterday and staged a long and spirited , Labor Day parade up.Fifth Avenue . Vice President Humphrey , beginning his campaign for the Presidency , locked arms with labor 's leaders and was seldom without a smile during two-and-a-half- hours of marching , applauding , kissing babies , and opening a Chinese fortune cookie that contained the message : " Wise citizen knows that vote for Humphrey is vote for better life . " Within earshot of the daylong marching brass , fife and drum corps and bagpipes was Richard M. Nixon , who spent a working day in his apartment at 812 Fifth Avenue , at 62d Street , where the parade ended . Meany With Humphrey The crowds that lined the parade route , often only two deep , were seldom excited by the sight of Mr. Humphrey , who marched from 26th Street to 52d between George Meany , president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , and Harry Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virtually every person who shouted to the Vice President drew a wave and a smile , including the few hecklers who held such signs as " Kafka for President " and " Roses are red , violets are blue , brutality is disgusting and so are you . " To the latter , Mr. Van Ars I dale appeared to give the response of most of the marchers ? he held his nose . But , on the whole , it was just a nice sunny day for a parade  --  and for most of the marchers , whose number was estimated at 125,000 to 150,000 by union leaders , for Mr. Humphrey , who thought it was " glorious , " and for a little boy in short blue pants who yelled , " yippee , " when he saw a cowlady on a horse , and then a baby elephant . Even demonstrators against the war in Vietnam and the police got along well . Late in the afternoon , after the Vice President had left and clouds began forming , about 200 youths were thwarted by the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , they willingly aczepted an invitation to join the ranks of District 65 , Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Union and to carry the anion 's signs that listed traditional union slogans . The youths , most with long lair and wearing dungarees , : hilted , " Hey-Hey , ho-ho iumphrey-Nixon 's got to go . " When they passed a patrolman with a neatly trimmed beard , they gleefully shouted : " Get a shave " and " Get a haircut , hippie cop . " The parade , which began at 10 A.M. and ended at 5:30 P.M. , displayed quietly some of the strains in the labor movement . For one , District 65 and Local 1199 of the Hospital Workers Union , ? both in strong opposition to the war in Vietnam , were placed near the end of the line of march . Neither group thought this was an accident , in view of Mr. Meany 's strong support of the war . Second , Mr. Humphrey 's appearance in New York to launch his Presidential campaign was I break with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronghold of unionized automobile workers . But the United Auto Workers Union recently encouraged the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to suspend it for nonpayment of dues , and this was said by some labor officials here to have been a reason for Mr. Humphrey 's action . Third , the union movement has been smarting in recent years over criticism that some of its unions discriminate against Negroes and that the movement has lost touch with young people . Accordingly , the theme of the parade was civil i rights , youth and women in industry . No one made speeches on ! any of these subjects in this first Labor Day parade here in five years . Many of the young people marching and playing , instruments drew some of the loudest applause from the union , leaders and their guests in the ' reviewing stands in front of the Public Library between 41st and 42d Streets .

Javits and Paul O'Dwyer , who are competing for Mr. Javits 's Senate seat , were in the stands and marched with the union workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cathedral at 51st Street and were greeted on the Cathedral steps by Archbishop Terence J. Cooke . Mr. Humphrey said the Cathedral looked " inspiring . " Political leaders came and went during the day , and so did many men and women who have dealings with the labor movement . Vincent D. , chairman of the State Mediation Board , who has often rolled , up his sleeves to assist in labor disputes , took off his jacket in the hot sun , put on a straw hat and greeted the marchers to the end . Opposite the reviewing stand playing rousing march music the entire day was a band of Local 802 , American Federation of Musicians . The band ' rested when other musical groups went by . The line of march , which included almost 100 floats , many animals , several construction cranes and busloads of retired workers , was frequently slowed by the police at intersections so that cross-town traffic could move . At times some drivers were more interested in watching the parade .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
