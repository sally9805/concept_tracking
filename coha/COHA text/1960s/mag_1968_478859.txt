A young man walked into my office a few weeks ago and announced that he was ready to sell out . What he wanted , I discovered eventually , was a job . He had been out of college for about a year , making the scene , as he put it , around New York . Recently his parents had stopped sending him money ; so now , strictly for want of bread , he had to go to work . Publishing , he confided , struck him as less distasteful than any other occupation he could think of . Consequently he was prepared to sacrifice his integrity to the sordid demands of book or magazine publishing ? he did n't care which ? but since he valued it highly he trusted that Harper 's would pay him handsomely for it . In our further conversation it turned out that he had nothing else to sell , such as a marketable skill . Like many students who have a hard time deciding what to do with their lives , he had majored in English literature . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , aside from rumors he had picked up from other students and his teachers , most of them almost equally innocent . He was convinced , however , that work in almost any business firm was certain to be both dull and debasing , and that corporations were by definition corrupt institutions . Only after much anguished wrestling with his conscience had he decided that it was better to let himself be co-opted and corrupted than to starve . Corrupted how ? On this point he was a little vague , but he assumed that he would have to write and publish lies at the behest of advertisers ? probably cogs in the military-indus:rial complex ? or on demand of the Establishment characters ( whoever hey might be ) who owned the joint . I never was able to persuade him that this danger was illusory . Neither could he comprehend that a man so ready to surrender his own convictions would be of no use to a publisher . Corruption is a real danger to a publisher , but it rarely comes on in the simple guise of bribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept alert for some beautiful blonde spy in a black satin dress who might try to worm her way into my confidence ; but none ever did . Nor in more than thirty years of editing and publishing have I ever been offered a bribe , or a promise of advertising in return for editorial favors . On the one occasion when I was offered money ? a dazzling sum ? for partial surrender of the editorial control of this magazine , the man who tendered it had no thought of bribery . On the contrary , his motives were lofty and ( as I shall explain in a moment ) he sought to gain nothing but the public good , as he saw it . Coercion is seldom a bother , either . A long time ago when I was editing the undergraduate daily at the University of Oklahoma , I was threatened by a gang of campus toughs ? a cross between a secret fraternity and a juvenile Klan ? which wanted to suppress news about a local abortion mill . As a consequence I borrowed a .32 Colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after the first of the anonymous telephone calls I actually wore it in a spring-clip shoulder holster while walking home from the print shop in the early hours of the morning . Nothing ever happened , so the gesture probably was unnecessary ? if not a little silly ? although Oklahoma was a rough place in thosedays and I did not feel overly melodramatic at the time . Never since then has anyone tried to coerce me , if you do n't count the occasional poison-pen letters which are a standard occupational annoyance . The legend that advertisers dictate the policy of newspapers and magazines is deeply embedded in American folklore , and apparently has become an article of faith with the New Left . In fact , advertisers seldom attempt anything of the kind , and virtually never succeed . Only three times in fourteen years of editing this magazine did I run into anything that could be called advertising pressure , and in each case it was trivial . A European travel bureau once canceled a small advertising schedule because we called its country 's dictator a dictator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , when the late Bernard Detioto noted that billboards were ruining the state 's once lovely countryside . And the Knights of Columbus withdrew its advertising because its then Supreme Knight resented our publishing an author who had criticized Senator Joe McCarthy . It may be significant that none of these instances involved a corporation . There may be businessmen who refuse to advertise in Harper 's because they do n't like its editorial policy ? but if so , they do n't tell the editors . My impression is that most of them , and their advertising agencies , could n't care less ; what they are inMr . Fischer was top trade-book editor of Harper &; Roar before being appointed editor in chief of this magazine in 1953 . He is now a contributing editor and is also working at Yale on a book about corning changes in American government . 14 . terested in is the size and character of a publication 's audience , since they want to place each advertising dollar where it will produce the maximum results . A notable case history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on December 4 , 1899 , when Harper &; Brothers went into receivership . It had been bankrupted by a depression , louse management , and the withdrawal of capital on the death or retirement of some of the partners . In desperation the remaining partners turned to J. P. Morgan , the nation 's leading financier and also the Boss Demon in the hagiography of all sound liberals at that time . He hailed the firm out with a big loan , put his men on the board of directors , and helped reorganize the management . As a natural result , according to the conventional wisdom , the company 's books and magazines should promptly have become mouthpieces for political reaction and The Trusts . It never happened . So far as I can discover , J. P. Morgan &; Co. never tried to exert any editorial influence whatever during the following quarter of a century when it held the financial strings . On the contrary , the harper firm continued to publish a lot of authors who must have given old Mr. Morgan acute colic ? for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the earliest and most effective salvos of the muckraker era . Another example is William Dean Howells , for twenty years ( Morgan years , all of them ) the writer of this column ; his editorials now sound painfully genteel , but in his day he was considered a pioneering social critic . Moreover , Harper 's Weekly first proposed the Presidential candidacy of an unorthodox academic , Woodrow Wilson , whose political ideas tasted like rat poison to Wall Street ; and the house published sixteen of his books without a peep from the Morgan partners . These facts are worth mentioning only because they are , I believe , quite typical of American publishing in general . It is true that some of the weaker newspapers do run publicity stories for big advertisers , particularly in their real-estate sections . A few travel writers will accept free plane trips and hotel accommodations with the tacit promise of saying something nice in return . And I have heard rumors that certain women 's magazines will gush a little more breathlessly over a new fashion if a plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to old timers ' tales , all these forms of payola may have been fairly widespread . But today I am convinced that they are relatively rare. * The truly serious dangers of corruption are more subtle and harder to resist . The most insidious is built into the power , such as it is , of the editor . In comparison with elected officials , corporate managers , or university deans , an editor commands only a small quantum of power ? usually far less than he thinks . To writers , however , it is a power of considerable significance , because he stands like a gatekeeper between them and their audience . Every day he confers on a few of them access to the printed page , and turns away hundreds of others . His decisions , moreover , are essentially authoritarian . However carefully he listens to the views of his associate editors and literary advisers , in the end every editor in chief ? of a newspaper , magazine , or book publisher ? has to make up his own mind what to print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility can not be delegated . Neither can it *Rare , at least , in the case of magazines such as Harper 's , The New Yorker , The Atlantic , Commentary , The New Republic , Fortune , and a half-dozen others with which I am most familiar . There is some evidence , however , that mass-circulation magazines occasionally , do get a good deal of pressure from big advertisers . For example , A. Q. Mowbray in his book about the five-year struggle in Congress over " truth-inpackaging " legislation , entitled The Thumb on , the Scale ( Lippincott. 1967 ) , reports a vigorous and apparently successful campaign of the Grocery Manufacturers of America to influence mass media against the bill . Indeed , Paul S. Willis , president of GMA , summoned tht publishers of sixteen national magazines ( according to Mowhray ) to " discus with them the facts of life covering ad. vertising-media relationships . " Subse quently Willis noted that eight maga sines carried articles favorable to th food industry . one of the mass-circu ration magazines , Mowbray says , pub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bill . i Harper 's article on the subject by Wil Ham D. Zabel appeared in August 1961 THE EASY CHAIR be diffused among any sort of **25;2347;TOOLONG group . The authority of any editor , even of the most ephemeral publication , tends to corrupt , just as surely as the more awesome forms of political and sacerdotal power which Lord Acton had in mind when he wrote his famous letter to Bishop Creighton . For the editor can , in some petty measure , help his friends and hurt his enemies . Indeed , he is under constant pressure , or temptation , to do both . For example , one of the duties of a magazine editor is to cultivate the friendship , or at least the goodwill , of authors . A lot of them write books as well as articles ; and when they do , they are quite likely to hint that they would appreciate a friendly review . Or , at least a review . Since some 25,000 hooks are published in this country every year , and since no publication can cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure for review space can become pretty stark . Some authors , or their agents , put it bluntly ; If the magazine does n't come up with a good review , I 'll never submit another manuscript . A few years ago I turned down an essay by a distinguished professor of literature , because it struck me as tedious and pedantic . Next week a letter arrived from one of his former students , a writer whom I had been trying hard to persuade to contribute to Harper 's . He pointed out that the professor was on the verge of retirement ; that publication of the essay would brighten his declining years ; that Harper 's had printed worse stuff ; that any editor with a spark of kindliness in his breast would do the decent thing ; and that if I did n't reconsider my decision he would never speak to me again . I did n't , and he has n't . It is fortunate that lady authors are seldom as glamorous as film stars , because every now and then one of them suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a warm and beautiful relationship could blossom practically instantaneously . For this reason , H. L. Mencken posted a notice in the waiting room of Smart Set magazine to warn poetesses that he would interview them only if they were chaperoned by an ordained clergyman . The literary females who try this gambit must have been more alluring in his time ; nowadays . alas , most of them seem to be about as resistible as , say , Gertrude Stein . What is more tempting is the possibility of punishing one 's enemies . An editor would be less than human if he did n't have an impulse now and then to slug somebody ? an impulse which can be especially dangerous for inexperienced editors who have not yet learned how hurtful the printed word can be . A precocious friend of mine once became sports editor of a small New Jersey paper just after his graduation from high school . One of his first columns was a funny but scathing attack on the local basketball coach , who had a few months earlier dropped the author off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a spirit of mischievousness rather than malice ; at any rate my young friend was drenched in remorse when it resulted in the coach 's losing his job . More often than I like to admit , I suspect that my opinion of a manuscript may be colored by my dislike ofthe jerk who wrote it . In such cases , I have come to believe , one ought to depend heavily on the judgment of colleagues who do n't know the man . It would be better yet to stick firmly to a cardinal rule of publishing : When you are wearing your editor 's hat , * you have no friends and no enemies . Unhappily , I 'm not always sure that I have that much strength of character . ( I should note that this rule evidently does not apply to Little Maga- *This is not merely a figure of speech . George Leighton , a one-time associate editor of Hurper 's , had a railway conductor 's cap with a brass plate in front hearing the inscription " Editor " in two-inch letters . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first met him . Since his cubbyhole was not air-conditioned , he had stripped off his shirt and undershirt ; and , sitting behind his desk , at first glance he looked naked except for his editor 's hat . That ended any suspicion 1 might have had about publishing being a conformist profession.sines and some scholarly quarterlies . On the contrary , their chief function often seems to be the evisceration of the editors ' enemies . ) Another temptation lives permanently just down the hall from the editor 's desk , in the offices of his colleagues who are responsible for manufacturing and selling the publication , and producing enough revenue to keep it alive . Nearly every day one of them is likely to try to persuade him to short-ration the readers just a little bit . This does n't mean that they are wicked fellows . Usually they are just as honest as the editor , and his close friends to boot . But their jobs are quite different from the editor 's , and inevitably they sometimes conflict . For instance , it is the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a book publishing house ? to get the end product at the lowest possible cost . This can be done in a lot of ways : by narrowing the THE EASY CHAIR margins of the printed page an eighth of an inch , by using paper a few pounds lighter per roll , by squeezing another hundred words on the page , by cheapening the binding where hardly anybody would notice . Probably no one of these changes would matter much ; but if the editor keeps going along with these suggestions , in a spirit of amiable cooperation , he will find one day that he is turning out a shoddy product ? and the fault is his , not the manufacturing department 's . In similar fashion , a magazine 's advertising salesmen always want a publication which will be more interesting to their potential customers . They are not even aware that the advertisers ' interests , or the salesmen 's own , may be considerably different from those of the particular readers whom the editor is trying to reach . Consequently a salesman 's suggestions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all he wants is a better magazine . The editor , however , had damn well better examine every one of them as carefully as a horse trader looks at an old mare 's teeth . The tip-off is the fact that most advertising salesmen refer to their publication as " a consumers ' book , " When the editor begins to think of his readers simply as potential consumers of advertised products , he is in bad trouble ; and so , in the long run , is the publication . A book salesman , naturally enough , I is apt to argue for a jacket design just a trifle sexier than the text of the novel actually justifies . The newsstand dealer yearns for more sensational titles . The business manager 's figures would look better if the editor would accept a lower ratio of editorial content to advertising . All of these people are doing their jobs as conscientiously as they know how . And the editor 's job , a good deal of the time , is to resist them . I have been lucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues with whom such conflicts could be resolved on reasonable terms ; but they are always there . Robert Colborn , editor of Science end Technology , recently observed that conflict between the editor and his business associates " is present , open or concealed , on every magazine , the good ones and the bad ones . . . . It is simply a fact about the publishing business . Every business , of course , has to endure some sort of tension between its long-term health and its short-term advantage . But it is not as temptingly easy in most other businesses to forget what business you are really in . That easy confusion is what makes it constantly necessary , in publishing , for someone to guard the future of the business against its present . . . . To he guardian of the future is a permanent and important part of any chief editor 's job .. . . He must be a tough , suspicious son of a bitch . If he is n't , he is cheating his employer and had better take up teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor 's path probably is the Temptation of Good Causes . His friends , eminent citizens , and his own conscience exhort him without respite to give more of his space ( always pitiably limited ) to the promotion of some worthy cause . It may be peace or birth control or the American Cancer Society or the reelection of a statesman he reveres . The editor is genuinely interested in the subject ; if he published one more article about it ( even a piece that is not quite first-rate ) he would be striking a blow for mankind . He also would gratify some influential people , and feed his own ego with that most intoxicating of hallucinogens : the feeling that he is an Important Influence . In this heady state of mind he is all too likely to forget that worthy causes seldom make interesting copy ? and that a publication which harps on one subject too often is sure to sound like a stuck phonograph record . Only once in my experience were these seductions accompanied by bard cash . It was proffered by ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Chicago and perennial guardian of the public morality . At the time he was head of the Fund for the Republic . which he described as " a wholly disowned subsidiary of the Ford Foundation , " devoted to furthering the ideals of a democratic society , Over lunch Dr. Hutchins explained that the thoughts of the Fund 's staff and its grantees were not getting the public attention they deserved . Indeed , the pamphlets it issued sometimes were ignored entirely by the American press . To remedy this lamentable situation , he proposed that the Fund should take over each month a section of Harper 's ? say thirty-two pages ? and fill them with articles of its own production , In return it would pay Harper 's $500,000 the first year , and if the results were satisfactory the arrangement might be continued . Did Dr. Hutchins mean that he would like to buy thirty-two pages of advertising space each month ? No , no. that was n't the idea . The space to be filled by the Fund would not be labeled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not appear at all . The articles it provided would seem to be a normal part of the magazine , so the readers need never know that they had not been developed by the regular editors . The impact , he suggested flatteringly , might be greater that way . As I remember it , I assured Dr. Hutchins that I was in favor of both ideals and a democratic society , and probably would agree heartily with most of the causes he wanted to promote . But , I added , the primary responsibility of all editors was to their readers . In good conscience , therefore , an editor could not surrender control over the editorial content of his publication , even for the best-intentioned of purposes . Neither could he offer the readers somebody else 's product under the guise of his own ; x- All this sounded pretty stuffy , I 'm afraid ; but I still believe that the rule is a sound one . It is some protection , moreover , against all of the dangers mentioned earlier . So long as an editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his readers ? who are , ultimately , the people who pay him ? he usually should be able to resist most temptations , even those of his own ego . And in so doing , he will best serve the long-run health of his publication and the financial expectations of its uwners . ' Apparently Dr. Hutchins has continued to yearn for a publication which would pay adequate attention to the thinking of himself and his associates .
