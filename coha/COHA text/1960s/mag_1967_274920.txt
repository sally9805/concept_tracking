Debate Over the Dilemma <P> Sir : The very idea that abortion should present a dilemma Oct. 13 infuriates me . The morality of satisfied , waistcoated male legislators complacently discussing the academics of ending a prenatal life while terrified women are desperately inserting pointed objects into their wombs is , to my mind , infinitely more questionable than the subject of abortion itself . What is the theory behind keeping abortions from those who need them most , wives who already have too many children and unwed pregnant girls ? I assume it is a Puritan hangover of a need to punish them for enjoying sex , in which case denying them the operation is as logical as castrating their husbands and lovers . The objection that an abortion prevents a human from entering the world is purely intellectual , since a major problem today is precisely the fact that there are already too many people to be adequately fed , cared for . and loved . As for the Catholics , abortion legislation is none of their business ; nobody wants to force abortions upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it . <P> JACQUELYN S. LANMAN Poughkeepsie , N.Y . <P> Sir : If it is too delicate and shattering a concept for the overly idealistic and moralistic lawmaking males , then let 's have a national referendum in the 1968 presidential elections . By using the anonymity of the voting booth , we could all publicly feign to be utterly aghast that it was approved , and privately , all those abortions would then take place in hospitals under competent medical attention . EILEEN M. MURPHY Syracuse <P> Sir : If you intended to set the cause of legalized abortion back , you could not have done better than that sentence : " Bureaucratic paper shuffling often holds up legal operations until the 24th week-producing live babies that sometimes cry for hours before dying . " What a frightful picture . All the male lawmakers do n't seem to understand that a pregnancy can not be held in abeyance while an appeal , is made . Let the women write the laws . <P> HELEN ELIZABETH BEATTIE Brooklyn <P> Sir : It escapes me how religious leaders can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What seminarian has not grappled with the question of the origin of the soul in his anthropology courses only to come away as undecided as ever ? The church today is in grave danger of dogmatizing beyond the clear teaching of Scripture and perpetrating a far greater misery than it did when it put Galileo under house arrest for his " heresy . " <P> ( THE REV . ) ANDRE BUSTANOBY Arlington , Va . <P> Sir : To say that the final decision on an abortion should be an individual rather than a legal one is to assume that abortion is not murder-I take it for granted that TIME still feels that murder should be a " legal decision . " And I ca n't help but ask those who favor abortions in cases where the child is expected to be healthy and the mother is expected to deliver without danger : " Were you not worth saving when you were yet unborn ?
