The 125 folks who live in Union Grove , N.C.- that 's between Harmony Love Valley , not far from the Brushy Mountains - believe in being right nice to outsiders . So , when thousands of visitors stream into town on Easter weekend for the annual Old Time Fiddlers ' Convention , the residents go all out to accommodate them . Farmer Herman Speece lets herds of autos crowd the cows off his pasture . The boys at the firehouse move the truck out so that people who find it too cold in their cars or tents can spend the night on the firehouse floor . The ladies of the P.T.A . serve home-cooked country ham , chicken and cake at the school . And if the guests get to roughhousing , hooting , doing clog dances and even drinking a little-why , nobody much minds . " They can run around in circles and climb a tree if they want to , " says Chief Deputy Sheriff R. L. Warren . " It 's all open here . " <P> Bibs &; Nazi Helmets .

Last week it drew a record crowd of 14,000 dressed in everything from Sunday best to overalls , pigtails , Carnaby Street suits , miniskirts and chromed Nazi helmets .

With the encroachments of records , radio and TV , the oldtime music is inevitably giving way to " modern , " or " bluegrass " -a slicker , more heterogeneous style influenced by big-city commercial pros .
