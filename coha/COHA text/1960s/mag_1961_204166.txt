The confusing , sometimes contradictory personality of Brazil 's Jnio Quadros becomes more sharply defined with each new series of explosions echoing from Planalto Palace . In a burst of executive action last week , Quadros showed himself to be a determined , conservative-minded economic reformer . He also proved himself impulsive , thin-skinned , autocratic . <P> To hasten the end of the old coffee system that piled up surpluses and lowered quality by guaranteeing government purchase of every bean grown in Brazil , Quadros promised coffeemen more exchange dollars for higher quality coffee , less for poorer grades . He also ended government purchase and storage of the bottom 10% of the crop ( classified " refuse " ) , began burning the 7,000,000 bags of refuse currently on hand . <P> To restore reality to the meaningless fiction of overstated income and understated outgo that passed for a national budget under ex-President Juscelino Ku-bitschek , Quadros issued his own flinty figures for next year . Adding up the funds needed to support the immense bureaucracy and public works program inherited from Kubitschek , Quadros predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " a potential deficit of this size has never before been confessed by a chief of state . " <P> To separate himself from his own Vice President , Joao ( " Jango " ) Goulart , a political opponent elected by means of an electoral quirk that permits ballot splitting , Quadros refused to call off corruption investigators , who have implicated Goulart in several scandals , or to blunt their reports . On a protesting letter from the Veep , Quadros scribbled : " Return , for not being written in adequate terms and not representing the truth . " <P> Yet , with such reforms , many of them long overdue , came a much less defensible Quadros order to the Justice Minister calling for " investigation of the conduct of foreign news agencies functioning in our country , in view of the dissemination by these agencies of baseless stories of sensationalist or alarming character . " The order called for " energetic steps for definitive repression " if the charges were true . Fidel Castro 's news agency , Prensa Latina , cheered the order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear threat to a free press : " If the President thinks he is going to take the press by the throat , order investigations right and left , silence newspapers without resistance , he is very much mistaken . "
