The European Free Trade Association has an ill-concealed death wish . Most of EFTA 's seven members view their association as a temporary expedient that they would like to do away with-if they could only get into the stronger six-nation Common Market . Last week both organizations held ministerial meetings , the " Inner Six " in Brussels and the " Outer Seven " near Lisbon . Both groups are gloomy these days , the Six because French obstructionism has taken the fire out of the venture , and the Seven because they seem no closer to joining the Six . But it was the Seven who appeared the most determined to make the best of an undesirable situation . <P> <P> The EFTA Seven-Britain , Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Austria , Switzerland and Portugal-have some solid achievements behind them . Since 1959 , they have pared tariffs on one another 's industrial products by 80% and increased trade among themselves from $3.1 billion to $7.1 billion . On Jan. 1 , almost all tariffs will go down to zero , making EFTA a free industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to reassure the world that their association can last , the Seven are building a six-story headquarters in Geneva . <P> Still , the question preoccupying the EFTA delegates was how to crack the Common Market , which has about twice as much population , production and trade as the EFTA nations . Exports to the Common Market are all-important , particularly for Austria , which trades much more with the Six than with its fellow members . But as the Common Market 's internal tariffs have been reduced , the earlier fast rate of increase in EFTA 's sales to the Six has slackened . Denmark 's beef exports to the Common Market have dwindled from $100 million to almost nothing . <P> Feeling a sense of frustration and disunity , some of the EFTA Seven have individually approached the Six for membership . Austria has been negotiating since last year without making progress . Recently the Danes made a proposal , more propagandistic than practical , that Denmark , Norway and Sweden join the Six simultaneously . At last week 's meeting , Portuguese Economics Minister Jos Gonfalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members and warned that " an attempt to break into locked doors at all costs will give the Common Market the power to decide unilaterally the timing and conditions of European integration . " The others seemed to agree , and the meeting wound up with a decision that the Seven would deal as a bloc with the Six , whenever that becomes politically possible-essentially when France ends its opposition to the admission of EFTA 's biggest member , Britain .
