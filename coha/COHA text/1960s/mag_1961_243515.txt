In the grand days of the Empire , Hollywood 's relation to Art was that of an indulgent but faintly contemptuous uncle . Now , in the parlous years of the Republic , the relation is altered : Art is the uncle , and Hollywood is the loving , overindulged nephew . But family conversations are still fascinating . <P> Last week Producer Jerry Wald , whose last two films have been Grace Metalious ' Return to Peyton Place and Elvis Presley 's Wild in the Country , and whose heart 's desire is to film James Joyce 's Ulysses , said in self-defense : " I 'm not idiotic enough to put Metalious on a level with Joyce . " ( He had been quoted as saying that Ulysses would make " as exciting a film as Peyton Place " ) " It 's like talking about hamburger and steak . They 're both meat , but one of them tastes better . " <P> Smacking his lips , Wald went on : " Ulysses is the only original novel written in our time , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent screenplay writer . I 've been going over and over the book to see what the camera can do . There 's Stephen the artist , searching for someone to replace his drunken father , and Mr. Bloom , searching for the son he 's lost . Ulysses is essentially an adventure story . The characters have to do with the perennial struggle between all men because of their desire to compete . " <P> In another part of the forest , Writer-Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz ( All About Eve ) announced that his version of Cleopatra , which stars Elizabeth Taylor ( naturally ; who is Pharaohess of them all ? ) , would be considerably different from Shaw 's Caesar and Cleopatra . ( Work had begun on the movie when Liz took sick last fall . ) " Shaw 's life , " Mankiewicz explained , " is full of letters to naive young girls , instructing them in the ways of the world . He wrote Caesar and Cleopatra as if he 'd come upon Cleopatra himself in that pile of rocks . The play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with Caesar or Cleopatra . "
