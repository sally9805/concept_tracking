txt The first session of a State Senate inquiry into a deal assertedly offered to the Fifth Avenue Coach Lines by Mayor Wagner ended today in a stand-off . The day 's ? two witnesses contradicted each other in almost every particular in separate testimony . But , to the disappointment of a standing-room-only audience , the hearing was inconclusive . If there was a star , it was State Senator Harry Gittleson of Brooklyn , the only Democrat on the five-man subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee , which is making the investigation . His efforts on behalf of Harold A. Felix , New York 's Commissioner of Labor , led the subcommittee chairman , Senator John H. Hughes of Syracuse , to ask whether the two men had rehearsed their questions and answers . Weisman Repeats Charges The witness for the company was Lawrence I. Weisman , executive vice president . He repeated the original charges , which had been made by Roy M. Cohn , general counsel for Fifth Avenue . These were that Mr. Felix , on Feb. 23 , had arranged a meet- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had " a message " for them that he wanted to deliver " privately . " It was also charged that Mr. Felix , at the meeting , had offered to guarantee a fare increase for the company if it held off on its fare demands until after the Governorship election . A meeting was set up at the Pierre Hotel lounge , Mr. Weisman said . Those present , besides Mr. Felix , he said , were himself , Harry Weinberg , the new head of the company , and Stephen Hochhauser , a lawyer from Mr. Cohn 's office . According to Mr. Weisman , Mr. Felix told the company officials they did not understand the political situation and advised them to " become politically sophisticated . " He said Mr. Felix had suggested that they withdraw their petition for an immediate fare increase " and wait until after the election in November , and we 'll guarantee a 20-cent fare . " Mr. Weinberg asserted he did not " trust the Mayor , " the witness said , and Mr. Felix replied that " we will act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly remember that word ' celerity ' because I'had to explain it to Mr. Weinberg , " Mr. Weisman said . Senator Gittleson , after long questioning of Mr. Weisman , won from the witness an acknowledgment that at no time during the conversations at the Pierre had Mr. Felix said he had been authorized by the Mayor to make any proposition . The witness said the members of his group " had assumed " that the " message " of which the Labor Commissioner had spoken " came from the Mayor . " Mr. Felix spent ninety minutes on the stand under close questioning by all members of the subcommittee and its counsel , Howard Henig . He insisted that he had offered no deal , that he had acted only " in the public interest " to try to prevent a bus strike and that he had arranged the meeting as Commissioner of Labor and not as an " emissary " of the Mayor . " I told them that areas of relief might be found for them , " Mr. Felix related , " but that any arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My best advice to them was to make haste slowly . " " Did you say ' hay ' ? " Senator Hughes asked . Tells of Fare Pattern Mr. Felix said he had pointed out to the Fifth Avenue Coach officials that the Transit Authority , which controls its own fares , set the pattern for the private bus lines . He said he had explained that the authority had pledged to hold the 15-cent fare through this year but that it would review the situation after Jan. 1 . " I told Mr. Weinberg that when that happened and if the Transit Authority fare went up , the private lines might then also benefit , " Mr. Felix said . At that point Senator Gittleson took over and began to ask a long string of questions dealing with fares , politics and asserted instructions from the Mayor . Of the conference at the Pierre Hotel , he asked : " Did you offer a 20-cent fare after the election ? " " Absolutely not , " Mr. Felix replied . " That 's an outrage . " Senator Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gittleson had talked about the subject-matter of his testimony . The witness said he had had breakfast today with the Senator . The hearing will resume tomorrow morning . Mr. Weinberg and Mr. Hochhauser will testify .
