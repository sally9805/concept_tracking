txt BONN , Germany , March 2 ? Chancellor Adenauer called home his Ambassador in Moscow , Dr. Hans Kroll , today and made public a telegram ordering him to come to Bonn immediately . The Ambassador is expected to reach here Tuesday . There has been an outcry in the West German press all week over reports in Die Welt and Bild , Hamburg newspapers with the same ownership , that Dr. Kroll had recommended major concessions to the Communists for a German-Soviet settlement . In Moscow , Dr. Kroll had labeled the reports as nonsense and the work of liars and intriguers . Dr. Kroll had asked the Foreign Ministry here to start libel suits against the two // papers . Instead , apparently Dr. Karl Carstens , State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry , asked the controversial Ambassador to - come to Bonn for consultations . Dr. Kroll called a news conference in his Moscow embassy to charge that a cabal was seeking his downfall . This was the situation until Dr. Adenauer 's intervention today . The Chancellor 's telegram read : " The situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your presence in person in Bonn is necessary . " You have received a request to this effect from State Secretary Carstens . I expect you to comply with this request immediately and to desist from all public statements until then . " Die Welt and Bild said Dr. Kroll had outlined to some newsmen when he was in Bonn recently a plan for a SovietGerman settlement on the following lines : qBonn 's renunuciation of claims to the former German territories east of the Oder and Neisse Rivers now under Polish and Soviet administration . 9 Recognition of the existence of two Germanys and agreement to the political separation of West Berlin from West Germany . Bild also reported that Dr. Kroll had recommended a $2 , - 500,000,000 loan to the Soviet Union . A Mixture of Ideas 11 The two papers ' articles seemed to be a mixture of Dr. , Knoll 's own ideas and the outline he gave the newsmen of ( what he thought were the three goals of the Soviet Union 's German policy . These , he had said , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Communist East Germany , West Berlin and West Germany ; membership of all three in the United Nations , and the prevention of West Germany 's atomic rearmament or of any kind of West German atomic partnership with Bonn 's allies , b Accordino- to reliable sources , Dr. Kroll had added that West German foreign policy , must be designed to keep West Berlin free , to achieve a liberalization of living conditions for the East Germans and to keep the way open for the possibility of Germany 's reunification at some future , unforeseeable date Dr. Kroll declared that the Russians believed the German question to be the maim threat to peace and that he shared Premier Khrushchev ' : views that Bonn and Moscow must talk about the question . For this reason , he added , he was trying to bring about a Khrushchev-Adenauer meeting The 63-year-old Ambassador has given the impression that he is convinced that he alone among Western diplomats iE trusted by Mr. Khrushchev anc that he is the man to bring about a Soviet-German reconciliattion . Dr. Adenauer has not ' Iminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity . Issue of Atomic Arms Dr. Kroll has said that some concessions might have to be made on West Germany 's atomic rearmament . It was this point , about which Dr. Adenauer feels so strongly , that apparently led to the Chancellor 's anger and his decision to scold Dr. Karol publicly by making public the telegram . , Dr. Kroll did not elaborate on ' what he meant by concessions i having to be made on West ' Germany 's atomic rearmament . Dr. Adenauer has long been concerned that the Russians might convince the United States not to give West Germany nuclear weapons . Any such agreement , he has held , would make the Germans " second-class members " of the Western alliance . He has said that West Germany could not accept such discrimination . When Dr. Kroll was under fire last November , Dr. Adenauer supported him strongly against charges that he had exceeded his authority in outlining some views on the German and Berlin questions to Mr. Khrushchev . Dr. Kroll was recalled then , too . He has been quoted since as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Russians if he was not sent back to Moscow .
