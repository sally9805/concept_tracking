txt Houston , May ** Apollo 10 astronauts passed the halfway mark on their way to the moon this afternoon with a bad taste in their mouths . They blamed the bad taste on flight controlers at the space agency 's manned spacecraft center here who told them to add chlorine to their drinking water last night . The result was that soon after they started to drink today they got chlorine additive instead of water . 5th TV Show The astronauts  --  Thomas P. Stafford . Eugene A. Cernan , and John W. Young  --  reached the midpoint at 3:21 p. m . C. D. T. about 27% hours after lifting off from Cape Kennedy , Fla. , in a dress rehearsal for next July 's scheduled landing of Americans on the moon . Earlier , the astronauts put on their fifth live color television show from space , showing more views of the earth with Europe and parts of South America visible at times as well as views of the astronauts at work in their spacecraft . During the TV broadcast , the astronauts also played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Moon . " The recording , which the astronauts smuggled aboard the spacecraft , was played on a tape recorder built into the spacecraft . Pass 150,000 Mile Mark Ground controlers bid good night to the astronauts at 9:90 p. m . Chicago time , 20 minutes before the spacemen began a nine-hour rest period . At 10:58 p. m. , the spacecraft was 153 , - 543 miles front earth and speeding toward the moon at 2,985 miles per hour . When the astronauts passed the mid-course mark they were 129,940 miles from earth . Mission controlers assured the crew that their sleep would not be disturbed by the dull thumps of rocket thrusters firing , a noise which aroused them several times last night , The rockets were being fired automatically to keep the spacecraft spinning slowly as it sped thru space . The spin evenly distributes the heat of direct sunlight on spaceships out where the sun never sets and night never comes . Right in Groove Flight controlers instructed the crew to increase the spin , called by space pilots " the barbecue mode . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . On-ground experts believed this would prevent the rocket thrusters from firing frequently , as happened last night . Officials said Apollo 10 was " right in the groove " on its flight to the moon and no further mid - course corrections may be required . A small correction was performed earlier . The place where astronauts are scheduled to land in July is near the equator and when the Apollo 10 astronauts get into lunar orbit . Stafford and Cernan will separate their lunar module from the command and service module and fly down to within 50,000 feet of the surface and photograph and inspect the landing site . Stafford made it quite clear when he talked to the control center here that he did n't like the chlorine . " We just want to get this on the record , " Stafford said . " When he FYoungl woke up this morning and took a drink out of the water gun . everything was just great and everybody had a good drink and then I took a drink and it was absolutely horrible . " I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The control center then asked if after the astronauts put chlorine in their water tank they had let more water run into the tank . Stafford said that the astronauts suggested last night that they should have done that , but that they were told by the control center not to . They f ina 11 y determined what happened was that good water was in the hose leading to the water gun and that the chlorine , which was supposed to have been diluted by the addition of water in the tank , stayed in pure form .
