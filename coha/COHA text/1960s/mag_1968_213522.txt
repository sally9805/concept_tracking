Five months after being named United Nations Ambassador , George Wild-man Ball resigned last week to become Hubert Humphrey 's chief foreign-policy adviser . There was immediate speculation that at least part of the reason for his precipitate action was disenchantment with Lyndon Johnson 's Viet Nam policies . Not so . As the President said , Ball 's resignation " has nothing to do with public policy but does have something to do with domestic politics . " Ball is plainly aghast at how badly Humphrey is faring in the presidential race , and if there is anything that can make him live up to his middle name , it is the prospect of Richard Nixon in the White House . <P> <P> Castigating the Republican as a man " who lamentably lacks " the qualities to be President , Ball said that Nixon might try to escalate the Viet Nam war , has no real convictions , and showed his irresponsibility by the " cynicism " with which he picked his running mate . " The preposterous idea that a fourth-rate hack politician like Agnew might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball , " is fantastic and shocking . " He added : " I think it is important that people not forget the ' Tricky Dick ' that we used to talk about , because there was significance in that phrase . " <P> Ball , 58 , has long been rumored to be Humphrey 's first choice for Secretary of State . Once before , in 1966 , he resigned from the Johnson Administration . As Under Secretary of State , the department 's No. 2 man , he had tired of his losing role as principal opponent to the bombing of North Viet Nam . Eighteen months later , after the President ordered a substantial reduction of the bombing , Ball agreed to return as U.N . ambassador . The high point of his brief tenure-shortest of any U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.-was tongue-lashing the Russians for their Czechoslovakian invasion . <P> To succeed Ball , the President immediately named Washington Post Editor James Russell Wiggins , 64 , thus rewarding a loyal supporter and astounding even those Lyndon watchers inured to his most bizarre moves . A widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he was tapped , he was preparing to retire from the Post ( see PRESS ) to his 80-acre Maine farm and a weekly newspaper . Wiggins came to Washington in 1933 as correspondent for the St. Paul Dispatch-Pioneer Press , rose to editor before becoming assistant to the publisher of the New York Times . In 1947 he joined the Post , was named editor in 1961 . A staunch defender of freedom of information , Wiggins noted just a few months ago that the ideal newsman should be " a witness , not the principal , in events . " With what promises to be an acrimonious U.N . session ahead of him , the new U.S. ambassador is likely to find himself serving more often as a principal than as a witness .
