NEXT DOOR , NEXT WORLD By ROBERT DONALD LOCKE Almost any phenomenon can be used  --  or act  --  for good or ill . Mutation usually brings ill  --  but it also brings greatness . Change can go any direction . Illustrated by Douglas Hungrily , the cradled vessel 's great steel nose pointed up to the distant stars . She was the Cosmos XII , newest and sleekest of the Space Service 's rapidly-expanding wing of interstellar scout ships , and she was now ready for operational work . Major Lance Cooper , a big man with space-tanned features , stood in the shadow of the control bunker and watched the swarm of ground crewmen working at last-minute speed atop the loading tower . Inside him burned a hunger , too . Hunger , and another emotion  --  pride . The pride swelled Lance 's open-collared khaki shirt , as he envisioned himself at the ship 's controls within a few minutes . Finally , after long years of study , sweat and dedication , he 'd made it to the Big League . No more jockeying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was going to see , taste , feel what the universe was like way , way out  --  in Deep Space . The Cosmos XII , like her earlier sisters , was designed to plow through that shuddery nowhere the cookbooks identified as " hyperspace . " Lance 's glance shifted upward , scanning the velvet backdrop of frosty white points of light against which the slender , silverish , almost wingless form stood framed . More stars than a man could visit in a lifetime ! And some already within grasp ! His exultant feeling grew , and Lance kept his head tilted backward . Alpha Centauri , the most popular target , was not visible at this latitude ; and Barnard 's star , besides being far too faint , lay on the other side of the sun . But there shone Sirius , just as bright as it had glittered for the Greeks , and frosty Procyon , a little to the north . Both orbs twinkled and beckoned , evoking strange and demanding dreams ! One day , Man would be able to make landings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with any environment or emergency , would explore unknown jungles , llanos , steppes ; tramp up and down fertile vales and hills under blue-hot alien suns . Perhaps , they might even contact native species boasting human intelligence : mammalian hunters and fishers , city-building lizards , sky-probing arachnids  --  who knew what ? But now , of course , all that Headquarters permitted of flights was the most furtive of reconnoitering . You hoisted your scout ship aloft under high-gee , cleared the ecliptic , then swung out of normal space and jumped . When you materialized in the new sector , you set your cameras clicking , toggled all the other instruments into recording radiation , gravity pressures , spectroscopy , at slam-bang speed . The very instant your magnetic tapes got crammed to capacity , you pressed six dozen panic buttons and scooted like a scared jackrabbit for Home , Sweet Home . Adventure ? It was n't even mentioned on the travel posters , yet . But , adventure would follow . Some day . Meanwhile , at the taxpayers ' expense , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion-dollar thrill of viewing our Solar System from light-years and light-years of distance . Or so the manual said , right here on Insert Page 30-Dash-11-Dash-6 . Lance thought about those veteran hype-pilots who 'd already poked around in the great black Cold out there . How was it they were always compensating for their frustration ? Now , he remembered . Having few tall tales to spellbind audiences with when they swooped back down on Home Base after their missions , the hype-pilots got around it by bragging up Terra itself , and how at least you could always depend upon good old Earth to come up with something to relax this Warp-Weary generation ! " Something , for example , such as we now hold in our hand , brothers ! " Lance could hear them now . " Namely , one of these superbly-programmed cocktails , as only Casey can turn out . " ( Casey was the Officers Club barkeep and much-beribboned mixologist . ) " A real ' Casey Special '  --  look at its pristine beauty ! What better consolation can a man ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his orbit ? " " Besides "  --  this usually came out after two or three more tongue-loosening toasts had been quaffed to the beasts of Headquarters  --  " what 's so blasted special about landing on some God-forsaken rock out there ? " Hell 's bells ! Earth is a planet too , is n't it ? And when you 've been cooped up in a parsec-gobbling pot for a very , very long two weeks , any planet looming in your viewscope cries to be set down upon . Your own prosaic hunk of mud is good as any ! " * * * * * Lance Cooper 's rambling thoughts broke off their aimless tracking to swing one hundred and eighty degrees in midspace and dart right back to Earth . Here at this very moment  --  and less than a hundred yards away  --  came Terra 's foremost attraction for him . His hammering heartbeat would have placed him on the " grounded " list immediately , had there been a medico with a stethoscope hanging about to detect it . The attraction 's name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete apron . Even under the incandescent work-lamps of the crew scrambling up and down the ladders , she looked as fetching as a video starlet making her first personal-appearance tour of the nation . Only the fact she was Colonel " Hard-Head " Sagen 's family pride and joy kept the helmeted and half-puckered up techs on the rungs from whistling themselves dry in their enthusiasm . Now , she had completely bypassed the work area . Here , the lighting did not reach and the paler illumination of starshine took over . It seemed to render the girl 's soft blond hair and her full warm lips more intimately something belonging to Lance Cooper alone  --  and he liked that . He saw that she had turned up the collar of her tan coat against the night wind . While still a step or two distant from him , Carolyn halted . Her worshiping eyes rested fully upon the big pilot . Lance thought he detected a troubled expression . Then , the girl managed a tight smile that conveyed her outward resignment to all Man 's absurd aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Security , ' Lance . Dad wrote me out an O.K. to skitter up this close to the Launching Area . You know "  --  she gestured self-consciously  --  " big crucial moment ... lovers ' farewell ... I pulled all the stops , but it worked . " " Matter of fact , " she added , in an obvious attempt at facetiousness , " Dad opined he 'd have walloped the daylights out of me , if I had n't put up a struggle to get near my man . " Then suddenly , she was not at all brave , anymore . Suddenly , she had burrowed into his arms . " Oh Lance , had there been no other way , I 'd have clawed right through fence and revetments to get to you ! Men , men ! Just because something 's out there , as you say ... why is it so important to build ships and go out and look at it ? " Her fingers dug into Lance 's shoulders . " Women are saner ... but maybe that 's why men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tightened . " Kiss me , you big baboon . " Lance kissed her . A tender kiss , yet gusty enough that he lifted her from the ground and her high-heeled shoes kicked in free fall . The pilot found his girl 's breath warm , loving . Yet her cheeks seemed colder than even the crisp air should account for . And her body was trembling . He planted a second kiss , then set her down . " Hey ! This is no way for a Space Service brat to carry on . Why , you 're just about to  --  " " To cry , Lance ? No , I was n't . It 's just that ... you 'll be gone so long . " He punched her playfully . " Two measly weeks out , two weeks to astrogate her back home . And once I 've got my feet wet at it , it 'll be like shooting ducks in an alley . " Carolyn reached out , brushed a windswept tuft of hair from above the rock-steady eyes that looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just ten years ago , women had to put up with separations from their sweethearts or husbands that lasted months . When the old pioneer ships used to limp back and forth to Mars and Venus . But I 'm different , I guess . Weak , maybe . Or just plain scared  --  " This did n't sound like the blithe-spirited girl he 'd pursued for a year , then wooed and subdued . Lance studied her , then said slowly : " You 're scared . About what ? My first flight ? " Carolyn 's head bobbed timidly . Lance flashed a reassuring grin . " Everything has to be a brand-new experience , at some time or other . Me , I prefer to look at hype-flight from the point of view of the service . A routine thing . Just takes training . Otherwise , " and he shrugged , " it 's no more a risk than hauling groceries upstairs to some weather satellite . " " Is it , Lance ? When one or two ships out of every ten never make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others  --  " " One out of thirty or forty , you mean . So hyperspace is a little tricky . " " And there 's always pilot error to blame , too , I suppose ? " " Now that you mention it . " " Only my man is immune from everything ? " Lance smiled , a little wryly . " Any pilot can make boo-boos , Carolyn . I 'm determined to try awfully hard not to . " He added a slight qualification to his statement . " I 've always been pretty lucky up to now , at not getting lost . " " I thought the guidance systems and the autopilot computers took care of all the astrogation corrections ? " " On a theoretically perfect flight , yes . It 's equally true , however , that hyperspace 's geometry does n't always resemble the sort of lines and angles you find in our own universe  --  " * * * * * Lance abruptly stopped , realizing he was quoting text ; his mind groped for a better way to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there do sometimes develop special situations . " " Sure , sometimes . " An exasperation crept into Lance Cooper 's voice , despite his effort to keep it out . Hell , he was just a pilot ; not a rated mathematician . He 'd fly hyperspace by the seat of his pants , if he had to . " Lance , " said Carolyn . " Yes ? " " You feel it too , do n't you ? " " Feel what ? " " That there is danger involved . That something dreadfully , dreadfully wrong can happen to you while you 're out there . No matter what the eggheads say about it . " A paroxysm of sobs suddenly racked the girl 's slender body . " Oh , darling , do n't go ! " " Honey , honey ! " Lance patted her thin shoulders . " I love you so much . " " Love you , too , Carolyn . You know that . " " We should n't have postponed the wedding . It was wrong to set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry . I could n't see it any other way . " He hugged the girl to him ; she seemed more desperately frightened than he had realized . And again , as always when it came to comforting somebody , he felt as awkward and clumsy as some big lumbering repair-tug out in space  --  say  --  trying to patch a small trim patrol craft . But especially , he felt helpless in the presence of this frail , clinging , lovely piece of femininity he wanted so dearly . Nevertheless he could keep on trying  --  blundering though his words and gestures might be . " Carolyn , you think I wanted to chance making you a widow twenty-four hours after you became a bride ? " Lance took a deep breath . " So I did maintain the percentage was n't great . Still , it does exist . I 'm aware of that . I just do n't let it concern me . But you , Carolyn  --  do n't you see , hon ? Lance Cooper could n't let anything bad happen to his best girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Carolyn . Lance 's blunt , serious face peered into hers . " Tell you what I will promise to do . " Hope cleared away some of the mistiness in Carolyn 's eyes . She looked up at him . " What , Lance ? " " Once I 've knocked off my shell-back trip through the hype , we 'll stage the fanciest wedding this old space base ever goggled its eyes over . I 'll even see to it , the chaplain samples the spiked punch . And you remember what a raconteur the padre proved to be when Light-Colonel Galache got spliced ? " Carolyn Sagen managed a wan smile . Lance revved his pep-talk up a few hundred r.p.m . " After all , think of it this way . Suppose I had n't beat my brains out to get into hype-training ? I 'd never have wound up at this base . You and me would never have met . I 'd never have fallen for you like a ton of space-ballast . " " Oh , I know you 're right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's solid frame . " You 're always right , just like the Space Service is always right . But I have a woman 's intuition . And I ... I sense  --  " Unable to finish , she released her grasp and once more withdrew into herself . * * * * * Lance 's big muscular hand reached out , tilted the girl 's chin upward . Her face was tear-stained for sure , now . " Honey , this wo n't ever do . " " I ca n't help it . " " You 're torturing yourself with useless premonitions . " Lance wiped the briny shine from the girl 's cheeks as he talked , his own voice getting hoarser . " Carolyn , I love you so much that I ... well , you know I happen to hunger for you more than I do that Christmas tree on my control deck . But I just could n't give up a chance to solo out to the stars . I could n't , baby . I 'd probably be court-martialed , anyhow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . Not unless you actually got into space , then turned back . I asked Major Carmody . " " Carolyn ! You did n't ? " The girl nodded , affirming the truth of what she said . " Lance , I had to . T-there are some things I know about that you do n't . " A note of sudden urgency now tinged her voice . " Strange unfathomable things . Many of the other pilots who 've come back have not been right . I think it has something to do with their having been outside of normal space  --  " He stared at her . " I just now realize you 're trying to tell me something . " " Lance , I happened to overhear Dad telling Mother something one night . Apparently , he 'd been rolling and tossing in bed , could n't sleep . And Mother 's looked after him so long , she just had to know what was wrong . They went downstairs and she poured him a stiff drink . Then in return , Dad poured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Carolyn ? " " The most probable reason why some hype-pilots never quite make it back to our world is that the men involved  --  " " The men ? You mean , the pilots ? " " No , the brass . They have n't told the pilots about the fissioning of anything that gets into hyperspace  --  " Carolyn 's breath gave out in a sudden gasp . Her eyes moved away alarmed , and Lance 's own glance turned simultaneously . He saw Colonel " Hard-Head " Sagen and two other officers coming across the area . Illustration Time had run out on them . " Carolyn , " Lance said , hurriedly . " I 've gabbed with quite a few vets of hyperspace . At the Club and in my training , both . Sure , a man feels like he 's been crammed into a concrete mixer when he 's burning up light-years in a hyper ship . But after a while , I 'm told , even your brains get used to being bounced around . " Lance took the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not worry , huh ? " Carolyn started to say something in rebuttal , but her father and his aides were already upon them . Colonel Sagen was a tall thin man of erect military carriage . His features were crisscrossed with radiation scars and his voice boomed out like a military drum . Yet when one got to know him , he was n't so gruff . On the base , he commanded two thousand military personnel and half that many scientists and techs : a tough job , and one that he was giving his best . After returning Major Lance Cooper 's brisk salute , the colonel unbent and gave his prospective son-in-law a hardy handshake . " Lance , I hope you 'll be able to keep more of a rein on this little space-filly of mine , than I 've been able to . She was determined to see you off . " " I was glad to see her , colonel . " The colonel smiled . " Ca n't think of a man on this base I 'd rather turn Carolyn over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lance . " Been counting the minutes to take-off , I suppose ? " " He 's hardly had a chance to , Dad , " Carolyn broke in . " What with me in his hair ! " One of the colonel 's aides glanced at his watch , then opened up a brief case and took out a sealed envelope . The colonel relieved him of it and handed it to Lance . " Your flight orders , Lance . Got the preset tapes installed and checked ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , you should know your onions now , if you 're ever going to . Best of luck , son . " " Thank you , colonel . " Lance turned . " Good-by , Carolyn . Just four weeks now , like I said . " " I 'll be waiting . " " First jump 's always the hardest , I hear , " spoke up the second aide , cheerily . Like a great many other execs , the officer boasted no active space rating , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance and Carolyn were again quite busy , and did not hear . * * * * * Inside the shell of the Cosmos XII , Lance , sitting flat on his back against gravity , looked up at the sweep hands on the control deck clocks and hurried through his pre-jump check list . Tension mounted inside him . He contacted the Operations people in the bunker over the radio net . Colonel Sagen 's voice came in clear : " Five minutes , Lance . " " I am receiving . Area cleared ? " Traffic broke into report : " Take-off will proceed on schedule . " The function lights on the " tree " in front of Lance shone green . Gyros were caged ; the tapes were set to roll . Lance 's big hands hovered lightly near the manual over-rides . He was ready to fly , and the autopilot lights were already winking out in count-down . But you never could be sure until the last moment . What had Carolyn been trying to tell him ? Before he could pursue the thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; gently at first as she cleared the ground ; then heavier and heavier , until his face felt like a rubber mask under the acceleration and his heart commenced pounding . It did n't take long these days for any ship to build up a tremendous velocity in space . Lance cleared the ecliptic by a hundred million miles ; then with the Solar System spread out flat below him , he opened up his flight orders . His destination , he discovered , was Groombridge 34 , a visual double star . Right ascension : zero hours , thirteen minutes . Declination : forty-three and four-tenths degrees . Nearly twelve light-years distant . Since the star 's apparent location was nearly halfway up the sky from the celestial equator , Lance could begin the jump any time and not worry on his way about skewing too near the gravitational field of any large-massed body in his own immediate vicinity . He permitted himself one brief glance at the blazing universe that hung all about him : the bright fixed lights that were innumerable suns against an eternal blackness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Confusion and chaos seemed to dwell here ; if a man gazed too long , he could quietly go mad . But even more insane , he anticipated , would be the thick , writhing nothingness of hyperspace . Lance Cooper made one final check of all the ship 's operating components ; then crossed his fingers and cut in the hype-drive . Instantly , his teeth crashed together and clenched ; his strapped-in body was jerked back in its cushioned seat ; sweat beaded his brow . A thousand needles prickling his skin could n't have been worse . He had been told once that the switching-out from this known universe into an unknown one would feel just like a ten-thousand volt jolt in an old-fashioned electric chair ; and now he could believe it . Every cell in his body had begun tingling ; his stomach pitched under a racking nausea ; and an involuntary trickle of saliva dripped from his mouth the moment he got his jaws working again . But Lance fought the nausea , fought the sickness , and gradually as his flesh accommodated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most disturbing phenomenon of all took place . He felt for a moment as if he had been split into two persons . No , four persons , eight , sixteen , an infinity of other selves . They were all beside him , in him and out of him . His eyes ached . He shut them . When he opened them again , everything was almost back to normal . The other selves had vanished . Only the constant throbbing vibration of the ship remained ; yet it was a discomfort that had to be endured for four solid straight weeks now . There was no other means known , by which a man-made vessel could travel faster than light . Funny about that four weeks , too , thought Lance . All distances in hyperspace were the same , no matter where you wished to go ; it required no more than fourteen days and no less , regardless of whether you jumped one light-year or fifty . Lance had always understood there were equations on file at HQ , which explained the paradox . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being allowed to see them . He flicked a switch and opened up his viewports again . The starry universe had vanished . The Cosmos XII was riding through a gray void . Alone and  --  No , it was n't alone ! Again , Lance 's vision suffered a wrenching sickness . Out there in the colorless vacuum , hundreds of replicas of the Cosmos XII rode along beside him , above him , below him , stretched out in all directions . There had been nothing in the manuals about this . Lance stared at the meaningless phenomenon for a long time despite the fact it made his brain ill . At last , he decided it was harmless , whatever was causing it . He shook his head slowly and closed the ports down . He hoped Groombridge 34 would be less taxing . * * * * * The system was . After the ship reverted to normal space in the vicinity of Groombridge 34 , Lance hovered about it exactly twelve hours , following all the instructions in his manual to the letter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went well , there were no incidents , no vessels disturbed him ; though had the two components of the binary been at periastron , it would have simplified the work with the position micrometer . If anything else of interest had been detected , it would have to be deciphered from the film and tapes later . You can get as close as four billion miles to an Earth-sized planet in space  --  and it 'll still show up fainter than a fourteenth magnitude star . Somewhere in the galaxy , Lance supposed , there must be other races building spaceships and guiding them from sun to sun . But thus far , the scout ships from Terra  --  for all their magnified caution  --  had never run into signs of any . The old veteran hype-pilots had the best philosophy after all . Earth was the choicest hunk of mud you were going to find . Enjoy it , brethren . Well , he would certainly live it up when he got back , Lance swore . He would have his wedding ; import Casey from the Club to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten in his required number of scout-missions , he might even settle for a chair-borne exec 's billet , himself . Exactly twenty-eight days and twelve hours from the time of his departure from Earth , Lance Cooper was back home again . The Cosmos XII re-materialized out of hyperspace in the neighborhood of the Solar System with its fuel tanks scarcely a third depleted , but its pilot a drained man . Lance , truthfully , not only felt weary and torpid , but a great deal disappointed . He contacted Traffic , asked for and got a landing trajectory . A few hours later , he had coasted home and the trip was over . He scrambled down out of the ship , hungry for Carolyn . The base had n't changed any in a month , that he could see . A couple of new floodlights put in , perhaps . Some brass were emerging from the control bunker . Colonel Sagen , several others . He recognized them all . Two were SSP 's  --  Space Service Police . * * * * * When the colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insouciant grin : " Well , the Prodigal made it back home , sir . Hope that pessimistic daughter of yours is stashed around somewhere . Otherwise  --  " " Otherwise , what ? " returned the colonel , unsmiling . " Why I 'm liable to go busting right through that fence , " said Lance . " And say , if anybody 's worrying about the Cosmos XII , she flew like a dream , colonel . Matter of fact , she  --  " Colonel Sagen 's jaws snapped together . Wheeling , he barked at the two SSP 's : " Spacemen , arrest this officer ! Immediately ! " Lance could n't believe his ears . " Hey , wait a minute ! " he protested . " What have I done ? " Nobody answered . Not at first . " Well ? " Lance asked again , a little more uneasy this time . " I have no daughter , major , " Hard-Head Sagen growled , standing with his legs braced apart and his ramrod shoulders looking businesslike . " I never have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pistol , held it on the returned pilot , while the other quickly moved behind Lance and pinioned his arms back . " Is this a joke , colonel ? " Lance demanded , struggling . " If it is , I do n't appreciate it . You know you 've got a daughter , and I 'm going to marry her ! " The colonel 's jaws clamped tight ; and he shook his head from side to side , as if he were dealing with a person suddenly out of his mind . Then he acted . " Put this man under close confinement , " he ordered Lance 's guards . " Allow no visitors of any kind . " The colonel 's tone was harsh and worried . " I 've got to buck this matter to HQ . We ca n't have it blow up right now , God knows . " The space police nudged Lance . " All right , major . Let 's go . " Lance 's anger seethed to a boil . Hunching his shoulders , he rammed back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inside his mind to do if he managed an escape , he could n't have told . He only knew he had to get away . The colonel had flipped . And where , by the way , was Carolyn ? It seemed impossible she could be in on it , too . He stood free for a moment , watching warily . " Hold him ! " shouted Colonel Sagen . " Do n't let him run loose . " " We got gas pills , colonel , " suggested the space cop Lance had bowled over . The man was rising to his feet . " Use them . " Lance started to run . Over his shoulder , he saw the guard reach inside a small pocket in his webbed pistol belt . The man gestured to the others to duck back out of harm 's way . Then , his throwing arm reared back and sent a pellet sailing in a high arc . It landed at Lance 's feet and burst instantly . Yellowish gas billowed out . Its acrid fumes penetrated Lance 's throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight suddenly ebbed from him . His knees buckled . He was stumbling , falling . The sky reeled . And very indistinctly , from far away , came the colonel 's voice , barking : " Put him in the brig until he recovers . I repeat , let nobody see him . And another thing  --  I declare everything that 's happened here today classified information . If a single word leaks out , I 'll have every man-jack among you placed in solitary and held for court-martial . " Then , Lance knew nothing more . * * * * * When at last he recovered consciousness and was able to sit up in a kind of groggy stupor , Lance found himself , for the first time in fifteen service-devoted years , on the inside of a guardhouse looking out . With sardonic melancholy , he recalled times on his O.D. and O.G . tours when he had inspected various prison areas , peered into the cells , and often felt mildly sorry for some poor spaceman doing time for some minor infraction . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a pressing problem : the corps was an elite branch and intransigent candidates were weeded out quick . Well , now he was a prisoner , himself . He , Lance Cooper , Major , Space Service , stood behind bars . And no matter how hard his face pressed against those bars , he could only see as far as the corridor extended in either direction . It was n't far enough . Nor would anybody talk to him . He could n't even get the time of day . Not since his probation as a plebe , had he consorted with such a bunch of " hush-mouths . " Had he no rights as a commissioned officer and a world citizen ? He still did n't know why he was incarcerated , or what regulation he had broken . But that was n't his most nagging worry . What preyed on his mind most was Carolyn . Where was she ? Where ? Where ? WHERE ? He could have lowered his head and pounded it to a pulp against the wall , in his rage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't help . Besides , he was going to stand deeply in need of his gray matter , if he hoped to get out of this one . At evening time , a guardhouse trusty brought him his supper on a tray . Also , the man tossed him half a pack of cigarettes when Lance sought to bum just one . But when the pilot started pitching questions back , the trusty looked scared and unhappy and quickly limped away . The night dragged on , as unending seemingly as one of Luna 's two-week darkouts . Lance smoked , paced the cell from wall to wall , occasionally plopped down on his cot and went over everything that had happened , trying to find some pattern to it . But there was no pattern . Next morning , he splashed up and shaved beard away from a tired , red-eyed face in the mirror . Then , he waited . No one came . Finally , at noon a new officer checked in for duty at the guardhouse . Lance recognized him as a young ordinance captain he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The officer , striding down the hallway , wheeled at the sound of his name and came back to the cell . His eyes bugged slightly , when he saw Lance : " Holy smoke , major ! What 've they got you in for ? " " Search me . " Lance was overjoyed to find someone , at last , who did n't dummy up . " I thought maybe you might have a notion . " " I just came on duty . But if there 's a charge sheet lying around , I might dig up something from it . " " Would you try ? " The captain held up two fingers and grinned . " No sweat . " * * * * * Lance waited some more . The captain did not come back , however , until several hours later . After Lance 's evening meal , in fact . His face bore a puzzled frown . Lance stood at his cell door , gripping the bars . " Well ? " " I checked . Seems the brass are holding you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A specialist in hyperspace medicine . " " Then , how come I 'm not in a regular hospital ? Why the jailhouse ? " " Beats me , major . I can tell you this , though . You 're not the first hype-pilot who 's been dragged in here screaming . " " But I was n't screaming ! I was perfectly calm and collected , when I climbed down out of my ship . All I did was ask about Carolyn . " " About who ? " " Carolyn Sagen . Old Hard-Head 's daughter . " Lance felt a sinking feeling . He stopped , cocked a wary eye at the other officer . " Do n't look at me that way , man . " The captain had been staring hard at Lance . Now , he began shaking his head back and forth , slowly and sadly . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Lance asked . " It means Colonel Sagen does n't have a daughter . " Lance snorted . " Do n't tell me that . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been around the colonel and his wife since I was a kid . He got me the appointment to the Academy . They 've never had any children of their own . " " Why , you  --  " Lance reached through the bars and grabbed the captain by his shirt collar , jerking him against the bars . " It 's a lie ! A conspiracy ! Maybe you think I 'm nuts . But I 'm not ! " He commenced pummeling the captain with his free fist . Then he thought of something better . He snatched the captain 's gun from his holster and leveled it . Illustration " I 'm getting out of here , " Lance announced . " Open up this door  --  or take the consequences ! " The captain , his face ashy white , submitted and unlocked the cell door . Lance stepped out , got behind the officer , and prodded him into the cell . Tearing a sheet into strips , he tied the man to the cot and gagged him . It took a very short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He caught the sergeant of the guard napping in his chair . In a moment , the sergeant , too , was trussed up , gagged , and whisked into a spare cell . Lance then tucked the captain 's pistol inside his shirt and ventured outside . It was a moonlit night . A patrol jeep was parked on the drive , begging to be commandeered . Lance hopped in . There was something he had to find out for himself , and only one way to do it : Go to the place where they kept the answers . Wheeling the jeep along the military street fast as he dared , Lance headed for the base housing area . Colonel Sagen 's trim two-story brick residence was where he hoped to pay a call . He knew the route by heart . He 'd been a guest there often enough . The colonel 's driveway was empty of cars , he was happy to notice , when he reached the house . He parked , sprinted up to the porch , and knocked on the door . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches . But it was not Carolyn whom Lance saw peeping out at him . It was another woman , older . He recognized Mrs. Sagen . Lance was blunt . " I 've got to see Carolyn , and I have n't much time . You 'd better let me in . " An apprehensive , almost shocked expression briefly flitted across the face of Carolyn 's mother . It was as if she had never set eyes on Lance Cooper before . Even the gold oak leaves on his shoulders seemed to reassure her but slightly . She kept the door chain in place between them . " I 'm sorry , major . I 'm not sure that I understand you . " " Do n't malarky me , please . You know who I am and who I want . Carolyn , your daughter . " " Oh , " said Mrs. Sagen . It was said in a way that revealed nothing . " Look , " said Lance , impatiently . " You do have a daughter . I 've dated her . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's been spirited away for some reason . I still think I 've got a right to know why . " " Oh , my ! " said Mrs. Sagen , and her hand flew to her face . " You must be that scout-ship pilot who showed up yesterday . The one who  --  " " Yeh , the one everybody figures for psycho . But I 'm not , Mrs. Sagen . You know I 'm not . " Lance took a deep breath . " Can I come in ? I just want some facts . After all , this crazy farce ca n't go on forever . " The colonel 's wife still looked doubtful , but Lance Cooper had a way of pressing a point hard when his interests were at stake . He began talking rapidly and convincingly . He got in. * * * * * The light indoors was better . Lance 's eyes squinted , as they adjusted from the gloom of the porch . Somehow , Mrs. Sagen did n't look quite as he remembered . Her hair was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had dyed it . Yet her features were certainly harder and bonier . More like a replica of her husband 's . And her breath smelled alcoholic . Could a mere month have made that much difference ? The house had been refurnished too , Lance noticed . The living-room decor was more severe and functional . And the pictures on the wall were garish . Not Mrs. Sagen 's type , at all . Hey , wait a minute ! he told himself ; speaking of pictures  --  his glance skipped to the far corner of the room . A triptych of photos of Carolyn had always been on display on the mantelpiece . They would prove that  --  Lance 's jaw dropped . The photos had been removed . " Can I get you anything ? " Mrs. Sagen inquired . A little nervously , Lance thought . " A cup of coffee ? " " No , thanks . I 'd rather hear about Carolyn . " " Coffee wo n't take a minute . I was just making some fresh in the kitchen . " Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already got it ready . " Mrs. Sagen 's mouth managed a fleeting smile ; then she disappeared through a swinging door . Lance sat down in a wrought-iron chair . Finding it not comfortable , he sprang back to his feet and paced the floor . There sure was something wrong about the colonel 's house . Something very oddly wrong . But he could n't quite put his finger on it . Suddenly , his quickened hearing caught the faint murmur of a human voice . Was it Carolyn ? The talk seemed to be issuing from the kitchen  --  where her mother had gone . Lance tiptoed across the room , pushed the door slightly open . Mrs. Sagen was on the phone . Her voice was excited ; she was obviously straining to keep it at a low level . " I 'm telling you , he 's here ! Right in our living room . And he insists I know somebody named Carolyn ... Yes , that 's right . But do hurry ... Please . He 's acting much odder than the others did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glided rapidly out the front door and into the night . Where should he go next ? The jeep would serve to hustle him around the base for a while  --  but eventually he would be chased down and recaptured . And as for crashing any of the exit gates and thus attaining to greater freedom , he knew they would all be barricaded and heavily manned by now . Lance was still burning over Mrs. Sagen 's double-cross . Did he want coffee ? she had asked . Coffee ! his mind repeated , disgusted . What he needed was something stronger . A good stiff drink . That was it ! The Officers Club . Casey would be on duty at this hour . Lance would ask him to mix him a double for old times ' sake . Then , he 'd meekly surrender and quietly go crazy in his cell , until the headshrinker came and confirmed it for real . * * * * * The pilot got back in the jeep and drove on . When he reached the Club , he wheeled the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadier . Parking , he got out , strolled into the building as sneakily as if he 'd been an inspector-general paying a surprise call from out of Space Service Headquarters . Few officers lounged about . Most were at tables and engrossed in their own imbibing . Lance strode up to the bar , perched himself on a high stool . Casey , whose hair was red as a Martian desert , was rinsing glasses . He stopped at his task and came over , wiping the counter with a wet towel . " What 'll it be , major ? " " One of your Specials , Casey , my friend . " " Beg pardon ? " " You know  --  one of your Casey Specials . Where you start off with half a glass of Irish whisky , add a dash or two of absinthe , a drop of  --  " " I do n't stock no absinthe , major . " Casey 's freckled face was abruptly hostile . " You know that . It 's against regulations . " Lance fought down a tremor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute : " Give me a slug of Teacher 's on the rocks , then . " Casey measured out the drink for him . Lance downed it . His hand gripped the edge of the bar . " Casey , do you know me ? " He watched Casey study him . The thick reddish eyebrows knit . " It 's a pretty big base , major . Lots of faces . Sometimes , I kind of forget the names . " Lance 's blood pressure gave a spurt . " I 'm Major Lance Cooper ! Hell , you 've rung up my chits often enough ! " And his mind added : How could you forget ? " Major . " Casey 's eyes narrowed , while the uneasy suspicion in them grew . " We do n't have no chit system at this club . " Lance 's head felt like it would explode . He could take no more . " You 're lying ! " he shouted . His big hands reached over the mahogany counter and shook the bartender like a squawk-box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're lying in your teeth . If you do n't , I 'll push them down your throat  --  " Suddenly , Lance sensed people behind him . A firm hand clamped down heavily on his shoulder . The pilot stretched his neck around . What now ? His hands did not relax their murderous grip on his victim . The arresting party had entered the club quietly . Now , they were ganged up around him : Colonel Sagen , his two aides , a fourth man Lance recognized as Major Carmody , the base legal officer  --  and a fifth man too , who wore the insignia of the Space Surgeon-General 's Department . A psychiatrist . " Better come peacefully , major , " rasped Colonel Sagen . " You 've been ' cleared ' for an explanation  --  and if you 're smart , you 'll listen to the spiel and play ball . " The way it was said made Lance feel he could trust the Old Man for that long . Anyhow , what choice did he have ? " It 's about time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the latter 's greatly exhaled relief . " Only how come all the suspense ? " " It was very necessary , " broke in Major Carmody . " Was it ? Well , you had me about to crack  --  if that was your object . Now then , would any of you mind easing my worries about Carolyn . She 's O.K. , is n't she ? " His glance shifted from one to the other . " Is n't she ? " Nobody would reply  --  neither Colonel Sagen , nor any of the officers bunched-up around him . Sweat suddenly broke out on Lance 's brow . The chilly feeling went through him that if and when an answer was provided him , he was n't particularly going to like it . Not in the slightest . * * * * * Shortly afterwards , Lance was driven across the base by his captors and escorted into his commanding officer 's private office . The two aides were dismissed , but the psychiatrist-officer , who also wore eagles on his shoulders , and Major Carmody remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major , " he began , clearing his throat , " you imagine me to have a daughter . You 're positive of it . You even visualize her so well , that you remember something about how you were going to marry her . " " You 're not going to talk me out of anything on that score , " Lance shot back . " Perhaps , we do n't intend to . Colonel Nordsen , here , " Sagen indicated the psychiatrist , " has flown in from HQ to chat with you . He can explain the technical aspects of the phenomenon that has thrown you better than I can . I 'd advise you to listen to him . He 's just what you need . " " Just what I need ? What else do you intend to do ? Hypnotize me , so you can erase all my past ? " The colonel scowled . " Look here , major . You co-operate and learn to keep your mouth shut , we may be able to restore you to duty . But if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nordsen . It could mean a padded cell . The development of hyperspace exploration has to go on , whatever happens to you . " " I 'll tell you one thing to your face , colonel , " Lance replied , hotly . " I 'm not off my rocker . " " No one has maintained you were , " broke in Colonel Nordsen . " But Colonel Sagen had to throw a curtain around you fast . " " Why ? " Neither officer answered . Finally , Colonel Sagen said , " I think you 'd better continue with him , Colonel Nordsen . " Nordsen was a youthful-looking man for his rank , yet prematurely balding . He wore thick-shelled glasses . " Major Cooper , " Nordsen began , " let 's go back to when you put the Cosmos XII through its first jump through hyperspace . How well do you recall your experience ? " " I 'll never forget it . You Earthbound kiwis should try it sometime . " " Did you experience a feeling ... perhaps , rather uncanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What psychologists call the sense of deja vu ? " " No , I do n't think so . " " Perhaps some other type of phenomenon was manifested ? A feeling you 'd been split in half , maybe . " " That did happen . " " Describe it . " " It was more than just being split in half . I felt like I was suddenly hundreds of selves . I could see other replicas of ' me ' all around . " Nordsen nodded , thoughtfully . " That was what we call the ' Infinite Fission ' syndrome . All those other ' you 's ' were personality matrices of yourself in alternate worlds . Did you notice anything else ? " Lance nodded , grudgingly . * * * * * " What ? " " Look , colonel . If I answer your questions , will you answer mine ? " " Any reasonable ones , yes . That 's what we 're here for . " " Well , there was the disturbing thing about the Cosmos XII , itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out there in the hype . Where nothing material could possibly exist . Where not even light could reflect back , or any other wave propagation . " Lance shook his head , recalling the experience . " What could have caused a hallucination like that ? " " It was no hallucination , Lance . It was real and has happened before . We can rest you easy on that point . " Colonel Nordsen removed tobacco from a pouch , stuffed his pipe , lit up . Bluish smoke formed a halo about him . " Lance , the Space Service has been sending ships through hyperspace for nearly two years now . Only recently did anybody notice something was seriously wrong with the pilots who came back . Up until then ... oh , a pilot might act a little queer for a day or two . But who would n't , cooped up alone in a steel projectile for four weeks ? We thought very little of it . " " Uh huh , " was Lance Cooper 's only comment . Nordsen transferred his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space Service gets around to putting two and two together on the slipstick . The incidents kept piling up . A pilot comes back from Epsilon Eridani , for example , and insists on giving everybody left-handed salutes . Another has taken a scout ship to 61 Cygni . He insists at the Officers Club that Colonel Sagen here has a nickname of ' Old Hard-Head ' . Nobody else on the base is aware of any such thing . Then , still another pilot  --  " " Wait a minute ! " Lance interrupted . " Has n't he ? " " Has n't what ? I do n't follow you . " " Colonel Sagen . Has n't he got that nickname ? I mean , it was a term of respect and liking , of course . But  --  " " No , " said Nordsen . " No ? " Lance echoed , disbelieving . " Since when ? " " Not since ever , major . Not on this particular track . " " Colonel Nordsen , you 're losing me . " " Patience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another pilot lands on our base , and he wears a blue tie . Claims the Space Service has always worn blue ties . " " I take it back , " said Lance . " I 'm a pilot and all pilots are slowly going nuts . " Then , it occurred to him to evince more interest or they might ship him back to the brig sooner than expected . " A blue tie , huh ? " " And blue suede chukkas , to match , " Colonel Sagen 's hoarse voice broke in . " Most unmilitary-looking uniform I ever saw on a space officer . " Colonel Nordsen , the psychiatrist , set his pipe aside . " Gradually , we began building up a file of such weird discrepancies . Another pilot landed wearing a handle-bar mustache . He could n't possibly have grown so much lip-hair in a month . Yet , the man claimed he 'd sported the mustache for years ; and that every officer in his squadron was decked out with one , too . " * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His nerves were gradually getting more on edge . " What has all this got to do with Carolyn Sagen ? Why is she being kept from me ? " Nordsen 's eyebrows met , evincing a little displeasure . " Do n't you get the drift , major ? I 've been trying to accomplish two things at the same time . Cushion a shock for you  --  and explain why what has happened has happened . There is no Carolyn Sagen . The colonel and his wife have always been childless . " Lance got belligerent . " Say that again ! " " There is no Carolyn Sagen here . " " What d' you mean , when you say ' here ' ? " Nordsen took off his shell-rimmed glasses , wiped them , restored them to his boyish face . " I would advise you to brace yourself . By ' here , ' I mean on this particular time-track . " Lance stared at him . " Does n't the word have any significance for you ? " Nordsen asked . " Time-track ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a theory that parallel worlds branch off when ... hey ! " Lance 's tone rose to a shout . " You 're not trying to imply that ... that I 'm on a diff  --  ? " " That 's right . We 're trying to tell you that you have obviously landed in another time-track . One that is parallel to  --  but just a slight bit different from the one you formerly knew . To you , we seem to be the same officers as in that world ; but of course , we 're not . It is n't the same universe . Hyperspace is tricky stuff , as our men are finding out . You 've just got bounced around by one of the trickiest things connected with it . " Lance groaned . " Now , I 'm told ! " " I 'm sorry . It 's nothing new , only the information is classified top-secret in our world ; and evidently in yours , too . It has to be withheld from hype-trainees , otherwise they might deliberately flunk their course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . We have to keep them filled . " Lance was stunned . He hardly knew what he should say or do next . Finally , he put forth a faltering question : " Is there any way I can get back to Home Base ? My home base ? " All three officers in the room shook their heads in unison . " You might as well look for a pebble in the beach , " said Nordsen . He elucidated : " As a matter of fact , this is Home Base for you . The differences between one track and another are not usually too great ; the resemblances are many . Sometimes even , the returned pilot accommodates himself to the new time-track without suspecting in the slightest what 's happened to him . " " And in those cases , you seldom bother to enlighten him , I suppose . " " Naturally not . Security frowns on it . " " But in my case , you could n't cover up . " " Your case manifests a much more serious slippage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million or billion worlds further over than anybody from your world had previously experienced . Consequently , your luck has really been unfortunate . You 've materialized out of hyperspace into a universe where someone you apparently knew quite closely simply was never born . " Illustration " But Carolyn did exist before ... where I was ? I 'm not dreaming . " " No . Both our worlds are equally real . " * * * * * Lance , though he felt the truth slowly and inexorably sink in , still could not quite grasp all its implications . He turned his numbed face to the other two officers in the room . Colonel Sagen and Major Carmody inclined their heads . For one despairing moment , Lance felt almost like hurling himself through the window . Then , he straightened up . His mouth compressed into a thin line . " If I must face the facts , I must . But , " his tone edged off into irony , " it sure is n't easy . You 'll have to give me time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , major , believe me . This is a hard blow to take and I would n't care to be on the receiving end , myself . But you 'll adjust . If you like , I 'll recommend you for convalescent leave . You understand , of course , " the psychiatrist went on , " that we expect you to keep tight-lipped . Our hype-classes are still too small . We need a lot of sharp men , and they have to be volunteers . Right , Colonel Sagen ? " " Right . " Lance dropped the proffered hand . " I get it . Let the word get around how hyperspace messes you up , all your bright young jets will bug out on it . That 's your main worry , is n't it ? Not what happens to me . " " Frankly , yes , " Nordsen acknowledged , without blinking . " But the Space Service is also concerned about individuals . Do n't worry now , major . We 'll look after you . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . " Far as I 'm concerned , the Space Service can go to hell . What reason have I got to stay in it ? You 've conned me out of all that meant anything in my life . " Nobody said a word . Lance rose to his feet , unsteadily . His sardonic glance swept over them . " I suppose it 's back to the guardhouse for me now , huh ? Well , I wo n't be sorry to go . I 'll find better company . And I refuse your bribe of special leave-time . " Colonel Nordsen seemed unaffected . " You 're making a mistake , " he said , calmly . " Am I ? " " Major , we 're offering you a chance to get adjusted and assimilated . Take it or leave it . We can hold you in the brig until you see reason . But you 're a good man . We need you . " " For what ? More flights through that hyperspace muck ? " " If you can pass our mental stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 'll be grounded . " Lance made a sudden decision . " I want to go up right now . " " What ? " * * * * * " You heard me . I want to go up in the Cosmos XII right now , tests or no tests . Ground me  --  and I 'll never have a chance again . Do n't you think I 'm hep to that ? " " We 'll see that you 're not grounded , " broke in Colonel Sagen , from behind his desk . But Lance did n't believe him . " Do n't try to kid me , colonel , " he snapped out . " You write me out flight orders for the Cosmos XII , or I 'll blab everything I know . You ca n't hang me , you ca n't tear my tongue out  --  and I know I 'll bust out of your guardhouse one way or another ! You 'll see ! And then , how will you fill up your precious training classes ? Then , how will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars ? The stars ! Ha , ha ! That 's the biggest joke of all ! " Colonel Sagen began to splutter . Lance , watching him carefully , decided there was n't much resemblance between the old boy and the fine Colonel Sagen he 'd known in his own world . Maybe it 'd been having the softening influence of normal family life and a growing daughter that had made old Hard-Head human . " You 'll never get away with this , " Sagen warned . " We 're three against one . " " Wo n't I ? " Lance 's hand darted inside his shirt . " Maybe this 'll equalize us . " He brought out the pistol he 'd taken off the captain in the guardhouse . Sagen , Nordsen , and Carmody backed off from it . " The Cosmos XII is still two-thirds fueled , " Lance said . " And well-stocked on provisions . Besides , I 'm a light eater in hyperspace  --  as who is n't ? I intend to take that ship out again , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the safety and waved the gun back and forth , to demonstrate what he meant . * * * * * It worked . Lance got his ship , using Colonel Sagen as both shield and go-between after he had first tied up the other two officers in a closet . He kept a close watch , of course , for the SSP 's and their gas pellets ; but apparently an alarm was not raised soon enough for the base police to hurl into action . After having the colonel authorize a space clearance for him by contacting Traffic directly over the ship 's mike , Lance finally released him . The colonel scooted down the ladder . Lance gave him time to clear the pad , but little more ; then he went to work pushing buttons on the manual desk . The Cosmos XII blasted loose from her moorings and soared aloft into space . At five thousand miles above Earth 's surface , Lance re-checked his tapes . Groombridge 34 was the only possible destination the autopilot could take him to . Somehow , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He cut into hyperspace as quickly as he dared ; then sat back and relaxed . That is , as much as any man could in hype . When he reached Groombridge 34 , all Lance did was pop out into normal space long enough to assure himself he had reached the proper checkpoint for turning back . The tapes were in good order , and there had been no hitches . Grunting , he threw in the switch-over and once more found himself plowing through hyperspace . Only this time , he was homeward bound . If he were lucky , just real lucky , he told himself , there might be a Carolyn Sagen alive and waiting for him in whatever time-track he wound up in this time . At last , he materialized again in the Solar System . Or some Solar System , anyhow . As far as he could tell , all the planets looked unchanged . It was just four weeks to the day , since his escape from World Two . This would be World Three . He had been gone eight weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecliptic at a different angle than before , and Terra was farther along in her journey around Sol . He needed a new landing trajectory . His eye swept his panel , to see if anything had been preset . There was no green flashing on the deck , where there should have been green . Oh , well . There could have been cruisers waiting in space , too , to pot him with ship-to-ship missiles . He 'd taken one chance , he could take another . Lance opened a switch and called Base Traffic 's frequency . " This is the Cosmos XII , Major Lance Cooper piloting . Just broke out of hype . Can you read me ? " He repeated the message for several minutes . Finally , he got an answer . A startled voice whipped back at him through crackling static : " Cosmos XII , this is Traffic . Who did you say you were up there ? " * * * * * Lance hardly knew whether he felt more like laughing or crying . He was fairly close to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And being pretty much of an optimist , he also decided that it was a time-track where he had been known . Only being so long overdue , he had probably been given up for lost . On this premise , he could visualize all the consternation and excitement now in progress downstairs ; the personnel were likely falling all over each other in the stampede to pass the word around . " I 'm Major Lance Cooper , " he announced over the mike . There was a long pause . " Repeat that , please . " " This is Lance Cooper , Major , Space Service . I 'm up here in the Cosmos XII . " " B-b-but you ca n't be . " " Who says I ca n't . Say , what 's the matter with you monkeys ? I want to come in . " Another voice took over on the channel . " The lieutenant 's right . You actually do sound like Cooper , whoever you are ! " Lance laughed openly . " I 've lived with him all my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost ? " " Well ... no . We know you 're real . We 're getting a blip from you . Only thing is  --  " " Let 's talk about it when I get down , " Lance interrupted . " I need a program fast . Get those G.S . computers working and read me an orbit . " " W-will do . " " And one more thing : Is Colonel Sagen around ? " " Not today , major . He had to fly to Luna . " " How about his daughter ? " " Who ? " Oh , no ! Lance felt his heart almost stop . Had the big try been for nothing ? He chanced a repeat . " His daughter . Carolyn Sagen . " This time , he got results . " Oh ! You mean Hard-Head 's daughter . The one who ... say , was n't she all set to marry you ? " " You bet your last commendation ribbon she was . And she 's going to ! Hey ! " Lance shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or  --  " The voice of the first operator at Traffic came back on . " The captain had to take off . No sir , major . She 's not sick . We just do n't know how she 's gon na take this , is all . " " With bells on , Junior . Wedding bells ! Get her out to meet me when I land , will you ? And snap it up on that trajectory . " Again , the traffic crackled in Lance 's ear . There seemed to be a great deal of excitement going on down there . And then the great night rim of Earth swung under him , blocking out further radio communication . Presently , a relayed beam from Luna came in . The Luna spaceport read him a series of figures to punch into his autopilot . The new orbit would edge him in close enough to Terra , that he could pick up an assist from the G.A . system of his home base . Lance rubbed his hands together in his joy . He was cooking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * Six hours later , the Cosmos XII settled down in her landing cradle . Major Lance Cooper kicked open the air-lock door and began climbing down to solid ground . It was just barely twilight . Ordinarily , there would have been long purplish shadows at the far ends of the field ; but now the entire space base was flooded with lights . Were the beacons sweeping back and forth just to welcome him ? It hardly seemed possible . Yet , the apron itself , was swarming with people . Here they came now ! A whole mob racing towards him , and the noise of their swelling shouts preceded them , rolling forward like the breakers upon a shore . Oh , oh ! What was that in the far corner of the field ? A big pile of crumpled metal , already rusted and ready for the bulldozers . Some poor devil had crashed his hype-ship . Lance wondered vaguely which of his buddies it had been . Then he shut it out of his mind . A jeep swung out ahead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squealed ; rubber tires bit in hard , and the vehicle plunged to a halt near him . Lance recognized Major Carmody in the driver 's seat . Or another Major Carmody . What difference did it make ? None , now that he was able to identify so very well the other figure in the jeep  --  a slight blond figure in a trench coat seated next to Carmody . Carolyn ! He saw her get out . He saw her commence walking towards him . But too slowly , he thought . And he was too paralyzed to move . " Lance ? " she called to him . " Is it you ? Is it really you , darling ? " The girl 's step almost faltered . Major Carmody 's hand reached out , steadied her . Something was wrong again . But what ? He could not guess . Lance came out of his paralysis . He began running towards her . And in a moment , they were in each other 's arms without caring why or how : Lance Cooper and the girl he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment in each other 's reality . Then , Carolyn had to have breath and she drew apart for a moment . Then , she kissed him again . And Lance , for the first time , listened and made sense out of the welter of hysterical sobbing words that were pouring forth : " Darling , darling , darling Lance ! I cried so much , and now it 's all over . I do n't care if you 're not real . I love you , I love you ! I do n't care if you are somebody from another time-track like Major Carmody says ! You 're my Lance and you belong to me . It 's you I love and want now ; no matter how shameless I sound ! ... Yes , darling , it 's you I want , not that poor broken thing we buried two months ago . Not the  --  " Lance 's feeling of impending horror was great , but not so great that he shrank from the question that now rose and beat and beat at his brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolyn ! " He held her so tight he thought for a moment he 'd cracked her ribs . His half-shook gaze penetrated her retreating eyes , forcing her to meet him . " Carolyn ! What do you mean  --  it 's me you want now , not that poor broken thing you buried ? Tell me . TELL ME ! " " Do n't you know , darling Lance ? When you took off that night eight weeks ago , that night I kissed you good-by , your ship ... oh do n't you comprehend ? ... Your ship , it  --  " " Tell me , Carolyn ! " " Your ship , Lance , that 's it over there  --  the wreckage of it ! The Cosmos XII crashed on take-off that night , Lance . You were killed out-right . We buried you two days later . " THE END
