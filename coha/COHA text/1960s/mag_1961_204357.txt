U.S. defense planning rests on the assumption that all-out war , if it comes , will begin with a Soviet nuclear attack against U.S. missile and bomber bases . To deter the Russians from launching such an attack , the U.S. needs a tough , reliable , intercontinental ballistic missile that can be mass produced , buried in the ground , and fired within 15 minutes of the instant that enemy rockets first flash onto the radar screens of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System in Alaska and Greenland . It is now convincingly clear that the Air Force has developed just such a missile : the Minuteman . <P> Last week , seconds after its engines spouted orange flame , a Minuteman rose out of the inferno of its underground " silo " at Cape Canaveral , passed through the preceding smoke ring caused by the shock waves of its blast , and roared out into the South Atlantic on a test run that was considered perfect . <P> Experimenting with new equipment on the Minuteman , the Air Force can reasonably expect some test failures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so encouraging that final-phase preparations are under way for the moment when it will become an operational part of the U.S. arsenal . Last week airmen and officers at California 's Vandenberg Air Force Base were being trained to fire Minutemen . Slogging through knee-deep snow , workmen in Montana were well along on the project of digging 150 silo missile sites that will be scattered like giant gopher holes across 20,000 sq . mi . By late next fall , a full year ahead of the original schedule , the first 50 Minutemen will go operational in Montana . And by 1965 , the Air Force will have between 750 and 900 Minutemen on the picket line in Montana , Missouri , North and South Dakota , and other states still to be chosen . <P> " The real purpose of Minuteman is to get a true numerical superiority in ICBMs , " says Brigadier General Samuel Phillips , project boss of the missile and , at 40 , the youngest officer of star rank in the three services . ' ' To achieve that we must keep actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep operating costs equally low . ' ' <P> Cheap Bird . Known in the Air Force as the " poor man 's missile . " the Minuteman is a bird of a different feather from the familiar Titan and Atlas intercontinental missiles . As " first generation " weapons , both the Titan and Atlas burn highly volatile liquid fuels that require a trouble-plagued network of pumps and pipes . Fueling and firing the Titan and Atlas is an intricate business-many experts doubt that they would ever get off the pad with just 15 minutes ' warning . In contrast , the Minuteman burns a solid , rubberlike fuel developed by Thiokol Chemical Corp . Once the Minuteman is fueled , it needs little maintenance , can be stored indefinitely and can be fired , from command to blastoff , in just 30 seconds .
