A Thousand Clowns ( by Herb Gardner ) performs the delightful trick of turning nonconformity into a comedy instead of a cause . It is a first play written well enough to be a third or fourth play , and a bracing spring tonic for Broadway 's ailing comic muse . <P> Murray Burns ( Jason Robards Jr. ) has quit his job as writer for a children 's TV show called Chuckles the Chipmunk ( " When Sandburg and Faulkner left , I left " ) . His one-room apartment is an insult to the Ladies ' Home Journal . Amid the debris is Murray 's prize possession , his twelve-year-old ward and nephew Nick . Winningly played by Barry Gordon , Nick is polysyllabic without being precious . Murray and Nick share a zany palship . On a crowded elevator Murray levels an admonitory finger at Nick and says loudly : " Max , there 'll be no more of this self-pity . You 're 40 . It 's about time you got used to being a midget . " <P> The school for brainy tykes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kookie guardian , and sends a man-woman social worker team to investigate . With the arrival of these visitors from the small , strange planet of Social Science , the evening rockets into hilarity . The woman ( Sandy Dennis ) is a girl with dew-behind-the-ears charm and a tendency to fountain into tears of self-reproach at her own unsociological impulses : " I hate Raymond Ledbetter . and he 's only nine years old . " <P> To keep Nick . Murray must go back to his old TV job . Murray 's notion of re-ingratiating himself is to look out of his agent 's mid-Manhattan office window and remark casually . " Why , there 's King Kong sitting on top of the Seagram Building . He 's crying . Someone should have told him they do n't make buildings the way they used to . " Out of the squawk box on the agent 's desk comes the brassy voice of Chuckles the Chipmunk ( Gene Saks ) to put the whammy on Murray 's whimsy . The ensuing duel between man and machine may be the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the final uproarious act Chuckles the Chipmunk does a prostrating parody of a slope-shouldered , splay-fingered humorless comic from TV 's human menagerie . <P> Despite the crisp rifle fire of its gags , A Thousand Clowns would not be so irrepressibly amusing if its characters were not so appealingly human . Playwright Gardner gives each of them the chance to show a core of dignity beneath the crust of daffiness . Like most plays about nonconformity . Clowns fudges its theme by leaving its hero where it should find him , with a job , a girl and responsibilities . The play is very New Yorky in tone , but its high good humor knows no geography . In a uniformly superb cast , Jason Robards Jr. , previously starred in somber roles , emerges as the new clown prince of Broadway .
