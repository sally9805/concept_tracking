Mass move ments of refugees were reported , and the People 's Liberation Army massed troops at the border to prevent any from escaping into Hong Kong . <P> Probably not even Mao himself knew just how bad the situation really was . What was clear was that more and more elements of the army were siding with the anti-Maoists in the provinces in a spreading disaffection directly traceable to the by-now-famed incident in Wuhan . There , three weeks ago , General Chen Tsai-tao , whose command includes the vital Yangtze River hub city , seized two top Mao emissaries sent from Peking to bring Chen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite frantic efforts since then , Mao has been unable to subdue the open rebellion in Wuhan . <P> Vicious &; Cruel . Indeed , Mao 's efforts seemed to have fanned the revolt . Nearby regional commanders were reported siding with General Chen . Chen in turn was supplying arms and troops up and down the Yangtze to aid other anti-Maoist rebels .

First , he promised that all of the top brass who would come to the army 's 40th anniversary party and repent and switch to his full support " would be welcomed . " The ploy was a dismal failure : only four of China 's 13 regional commanders showed . Then , amid dark hints of a major purge , Mao summoned a meeting of the Politburo in Peking to discuss what to do next . <P> <P> The choices are difficult .
