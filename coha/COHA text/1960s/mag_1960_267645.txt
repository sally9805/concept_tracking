To the shocked Belgians , it seemed a bitter reward for their promise of freedom next June 30 to the rich Congo colony . <P> No sooner had the painful independence pact been completed than the Congo 's neighbors-Belgium 's old friends-began making mysterious moves that seemed aimed at carving up the territory for their own benefit . First , France , which still controls much of the region along the Congo 's northwestern border , began glancing covetously at the Lower Congo , the narrowing western edge around Leopoldville , which is the Congo 's only outlet to the sea . Then , 1,500 miles inland , the British-controlled Rhodesian Federation was talking of annexing the Congo 's Katanga province , which produces 60% of Congo wealth from a mineral-rich ( copper , cobalt , diamonds , uranium ) strip lying directly to the north of the Rhodesias . <P> Flushed and angry , Belgium 's Foreign Minister Pierre Wigny rose in Brussels ' Parliament chamber with a sharp official reply . France , he explained , had pulled out an almost forgotten agreement dating back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , claiming it still had a " right of preference " on the Congo if Belgium should ever decide to dispose of territory in it . This , said Wigny indignantly , might have applied in the 19th century , " but today territories and their inhabitants are no longer goods that can be the object of international trade . " In Paris , French officials sought to mollify the protesting Belgian ambassador : they were just pointing out the old agreement , not making something of it . But the Belgians were not easily reassured , for their Lower Congo is controlled by fire-breathing Congolese Politician Joseph Kasavubu , who for weeks has been demanding just what the French seem to want-that the region be allowed to stay out of an independent Congo and form a separate state , perhaps in league with the adjoining French-influenced Congo Republic . Kasavubu recently moved his family from Leopoldville across the river to Brazzaville , in old French territory , presumably to be closer to his old crony Abbe Fulbert Youlou , Premier of the French Congo Republic . <P> And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burly Prime Minister of the Rhodesian Federation , who gave an interview with a visiting London Daily Express reporter and chortled , " There 's going to be hell because I told you this . " Welensky 's " this " : he had been getting letters from the Katanga region , wanting to link up with Rhodesia " when the Congo gains its independence . " Who sent the letters ? Sir Roy would not say . <P> Obviously not Katanga 's Africans , who are 98% of the population , and want no new white masters . A likelier bet would be that the big Rhodesian and British mining interests , which own substantial shares in Katanga 's rich Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga mining group , and perhaps Belgian industrialists themselves , were behind it all . Welensky talks of fearing a blood bath and " rampant tribalism " on his northern frontier , would welcome a buffer state against African nationalism . <P> But Welensky 's tactless remarks offend many Rhodesians " Unwarrantable interference in the internal affairs of another country , " said Belgium , which hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it its independence .
