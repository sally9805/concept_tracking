txt WASHINGTON , April 22 ? What legitimate political use'can be made by Republicans who are seeking their party 's nomination for President of the Administration 's classified ( secret ) foreign policy files which Mr. Johnson has offered to make available to them ? The President has already indicated two limitations , The files will be opened only to the " major " Republican candidates ; and he has instructed Defense , State and the , C.I.A . to supply them with " all possible information helpful to their discussion of American /policy . " The definitions of the words " major " and " possible " will necessarily be made by the President . But a Republican who by , common definition is a " major candidate " at the time of Mr. Johnson 's offer In April may not belong In that category when the party convention meets in mid-July , Also , those who accept his offer Will have no means to form a judgment whether they agree with hisfriteria of choice of the information it is " possible " to supply them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises for the Opposition party , to some of whose leaders it is directed . And , since the material is highly classified , those who accept it would to some degree be inhibited in their discussion of the foreign policies on which the material is an important source . Responsible discussion of foreign policy , which is the President 's stated objective of his offer , can he made by competent analysis of the public record , since the policies , or their lack , are selfevident . And , because it can hardly be assumed that the classified files will be unclassified for the documenta- , tion of critical political analysis , access to them could be an uncom pensated burden to the critics . The fear of inadvertent disclosure , or an accusation of intentional disclosure by innuendo , would handicap the Republicans who are basing their claims for the nomination on The force of their attacks on the Administration 's foreign policy . But , much more importantly , acceptance by the " major " Republican candidates for the Presidential nomination of access to information which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign policy presentation of the Republican convention and of the nominee it most probably will Select . That is , unless the President 's definition of " major candidate " covers only those actively in pursuit for the nomination  --  Senator Goldwater , Governor Rockefeller , Mrs. Senator Smith and Harold B. Stassen . The vulnerability of a basis of choice which would exclude Richard M. Nixon , Governor Scranton of Pennsylvania and Mr. Johnson 's Ambassador to Vietnam , Henry Cabot Lodge , is established by its mere statement as a hypothesis . But that also establishes the unwisdom of a proposal which requires a Democratic President to decree which Opposition candidates are " major . " The Responsible Republican If the critical freedom of the Opposition party in this country is to be maintained , the President 's offer should have been reserved for the nominee of the San Francisco convention . Only he can decide with full authority to commit the Republican party to the restraint of its foreign policy criticisms . Nixon 's experience with respect to Cuba in the 1960 campaign shows how heavy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program for the training and equipment by the United States of the Cubans dedicated to the overthrow of the Castro regime . But he could not cite this classified information in defense of the charges by his opponent , Senator Kennedy , of error and total neglect by the Eisenhower Administration in dealing with , the problem of a Communist state 90 miles from the coast of the U.S. The Democratic charge in that same campaign of an inevitably approaching " missile gap " between that armament of the U.S.S.R. and our own probably did no great harm to foreign reliance on the strength and unity of United States defense . It was too promptly refuted by the very Administration which the charge helped to get elected : This history suggests no likely hazard to the United States from a foreign policy debate of the kind which , in all sincerity , is troubling President Johnson . He certainly has no reason on this day of his latest triumph to feel concern over his prospect of election in November . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 111 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
