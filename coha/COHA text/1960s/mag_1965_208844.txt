DEMIAN by Hermann Hesse , translated by Roloff and Lebeck. 171 pages . Harper &; Row . $4.50 . <P> Gerhart Hauptmann , Thomas Mann , Hermann Hesse : three glum Dutch uncles dominated the tone of German literature in the first half of the 20th century . The first two were world-famous figures-Hauptmann as a grim Grossvater of a social realism ( The Weavers ) , Mann as a laboriously brilliant intellectual who wrote the era 's most imposing novel of ideas ( The Magic Mountain ) . Hesse , who died in 1962 , was little known outside Central Europe , even after he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946 . <P> Happily , the injustice is about to be remedied . With this new and generally admirable translation of the novel that established Hesse 's reputation in Germany , his U.S. publisher has initiated a series intended to include all his major works and to persuade U.S. readers that Hesse is essential to their ethos . It will not be easy . Hesse is relentlessly esoteric-one of those Faustian fellows who make Moholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German critics , he is one of the purest lyric poets since Moerike , and among the most profound of the many novelists who elaborate the drama of modern man in search of his soul . <P> Merging Cultures . Hesse was born in the Black Forest of Lutheran missionary parents who had spent many years in India . German romanticism and oriental mysticism met in the Hesse household and merged in the boy 's imagination . Religion and poetry were his earliest passions , and poetry prevailed . At 14 , Hesse dropped out of theological seminary ; at 21 , he published his first book of verse . In the next 15 years he achieved some closet reputation as a man who had little to say but said it exquisitely . <P> In the empty bottle , in the glass , <P> The candle glimmers through the gloom ; <P> It is cold in the room , <P> Outside the rain falls softly on the grass . <P> I lie down again as I always do , <P> Cold and sad lie down again ; <P> Morning comes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> World War I changed all that . Hesse protested publicly against the Kaiser 's policies , suffered an emotional breakdown , was cured by a pupil of Switzerland 's Carl Jung , and in 1919 published Demian , the story of a young man 's struggle for identity that electrified a generation looking for a way out of moral and political disaster . <P> Glinting Images . Hesse 's hero is obviously himself : the son of a devout and prosperous burgher who in childhood encounters a strange companion named Max Demian . Demian is a boy , but he has " the face of a man , superior and purposeful , lucid and calm , with knowing eyes . Yet the face had something feminine about it too , and was somehow a thousand years old . He was different , like an animal or a spirit or a picture , unimaginably different from the rest of us.
