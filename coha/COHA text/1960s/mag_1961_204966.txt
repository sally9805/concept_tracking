The festive sounds that came from the tin-roofed village school at Namone last week suggested a cocktail party more than a peace conference . Burgundy and beer at lunch added to the hilarity . While the spokesman for the ' ' neutralist " bloc laughed uproariously at his own jokes , pigs rooted about on the dirt floor scavenging bits of juicy pork and chicken from the table . Even stone-faced General Phoun Sipraseuth , leader of the Communist Pathet Lao delegation , occasionally showed a frozen smile . <P> He had reason to smile . After five months of talk and 37 meetings at Namone , the pro-Western delegates were giving in all along the line , and the West once again faced a major crisis in Laos . <P> Iron-Curtain Twelve . The immediate conference issue seemed small : where should the three princes-pro-Western Premier Prince Boun Oum , Red Prince Souphanouvong , and " neutralist " ' Prince Souvanna Phouma-meet to form a new government ? Boun Oum 's man had held out for the royal capital of Luangprabang , but now agreed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Lik River , where one bank is held by the Royal Laotian Army and the other by the Communist Pathet Lao . <P> In a desperate effort to salvage something , Boun Oum 's delegates argued that the princes should confer in the no man 's land of the center of the bridge at Hin Heup . This brought wild guffaws from the other side , as one of the neutralist dele gates pointed out that the bridge had been blown up and the princes could not stand in midair . The Boun Oum man came back with the suggestion that a raft be built and anchored in midriver . With a mock-serious air , the neutralist chief delegate drew a lurid picture of the dangers that the princes would face on a raft in the midst of the monsoon-swollen torrent , where they might be swept away along with all hopes for peace . Rising to a fever pitch , he enumerated all those who would have to be with the princes-advisers , guards , servants-and the proposed raft grew to the size of Noah 's Ark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings should alternate between both banks of the river . <P> At the meeting , scheduled to start this week , the three princes are to select a 16-man Cabinet , which will almost certainly be headed by Souvanna Phouma as Premier . Four of the Cabinet seats will go to Boun Oum 's supporters , four to the Reds , and eight to Souvanna Phouma 's neutrals , who in most cases are not distinguishable from the Communists . Said a European diplomat : ' ' How can you expect the Western powers to accept a government with four from our side and twelve from behind the Iron Curtain ? " <P> The Key Question . The only alternative to acceptance is renewed fighting . Interviewed in Bangkok , the capital of neighboring Thailand . Admiral Harry D. Felt , U.S. Commander in Chief Pacific , conceded that there was " danger " that the civil war might again break out in a matter of weeks . As the rainy season drew to a close , more and more Soviet transport planes landed at Xieng Khoung with supplies and equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels of Captain Kong Le . Battle-tested cadres from Communist North Viet Nam are drilling the Pathet Lao , driving their truck convoys , stringing communication lines , and flying their helicopters .
