THE DIFFICULTY OF BEING by Jean Cocteau . 160 pages . Coward-McCann. $4.50 . <P> <P> Tradition has it that it is difficult to be an artist ; but it has always been even more difficult to act the artist . Exactly what is his role , and how should he play it ? Should he go to great hair lengths and openly flout middle-class convention at every turn ? Or should he simply play it cool , all buttoned down on the outside , la vie de bohme beating away on the inside ? Each role carries the built-in penalties of repression-the one by society , the other by self . <P> Jean Cocteau ( 1889-1963 ) may not have been a great artist , but he was great as an artist . He was a flashing volcano of creation and affectation in many arts , but he was best known for his strange novels ( Thomas l'Imposteur , Les Enfants Terribles ) , his baroque plays ( The Infernal Machine , The Human Voice ) and , above all , his otherworldly films ( The Blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beast , Orpheus , Les Enfants Terribles ) . He was also given to scandalous public poses as an overt homosexual and self-confessed drug user . But unlike Oscar Wilde , who tripped and fell into the gutter of Victorian reality while trying to walk his mystic way , Cocteau , for all of his histrionics and acrobatics , always managed to regain a safe perch . He was somehow able to have his cakewalking , eat his opium , and yet wind up a middle-class immortal , a member of that superrespectable college of venerables , the Acadmie Franaise . <P> The Method . The Difficulty of Being , a notebook of autobiographical jottings and esthetic musings that Cocteau kept in 1946 , and now published in this country , reveals some of the reasons behind the success of his performance . First , Cocteau believed as firmly as any Method actor in the truth of his role as an artist . Romantically convinced that the artist is the medium , he approached the novel , drama , painting , ballet and , finally , cinema , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal " poetry , " and he did not so much study each new form as pour himself into it . <P> At the same time , however , Cocteau seems to have known in the marrow of his Paris-burgher bones that the only successful French Revolution was that which had been conducted by the bourgeois , not against them . Although he liked to shock and astonish them on his own terms , he was always careful not to offend or challenge on their terms . Astutely , he wrote : " I know to what extent I can go too far . " <P> In Case of Fire . In this book he is ever a model of discretion . In spite of the jacket 's phosphorescent hints of lurid reminiscences about Proust and Picasso , Stravinsky and Nijinsky , the author does not intrude upon their saintly privacies . He also rarely allows the reader to enter into his own . He speaks from a distance , less confessor than professor , looking up from his lectern every few moments to savor appreciative glances . <P> And often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mot and the telling aphorism , and these pages teem with samples . Perhaps the best is the anecdotal quip that American Composer Ned Rorem relates in his introduction . A literary monthly once posed a question to several writers : " If your house were burning down and you could take one thing , what would it be ? " " I 'd take the fire , " answered Jean Cocteau .
