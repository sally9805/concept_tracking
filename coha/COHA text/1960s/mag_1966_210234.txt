For weeks , Indonesians have been looking forward to the meeting of the Provisional People 's Consultative Congress as a dramatic test of strength between President Sukarno and the country 's new ruling triumvirate headed by Army General Suharto . Students threatened to put six guards on each of the Congress ' 616 members to make sure they did the proper thing . And the proper thing would be a drastic reduction in Sukarno 's status ; the students demanded that he be stripped of his President-for-life title and forced to run for re-election every five years . They also called for a return to parliamentary rule and new elections . Behind their demands , of course , stood General Suharto , who quietly encouraged the students to continue their demonstrations in the streets of Djakarta . <P> When Sukarno realized that the Congress might indeed dilute his already weakened presidential powers , he angrily summoned Suharto and the other triumvirate members , Foreign Minister Adam Malik and the Sultan of Jogjakarta , the economics chief , to a meeting at the Djakarta home of his lovely Japanese-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have made him one of the world 's most durable rulers , Sukarno threatened to dissolve the Congress , which he had reduced to a rubber stamp anyway . Suharto refused to allow that , since the triumvirate hopes to use the Congress as the vehicle by which to re-establish democratic government in Indonesia . But in line with its policy of avoiding any frontal clashes with Sukarno , whose popularity remains high among the back-country masses , the triumvirate agreed to postpone the Congress indefinitely . <P> Next , Sukarno turned to Malik , who had just returned from talks with the Philippine Foreign Minister in Bangkok , where Malik had declared that he would like to end Indonesia 's costly konfrontasi with Malaysia " tomorrow . " " We want to make war , " thundered Sukarno , " and you want to end it . " " If that 's the way you feel , you can fire me , " replied Foreign Minister Malik coolly . Sukarno quieted down and changed the subject , for he fully realizes that , at least for the present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they can fire him .
