When medicare was still in the talking stage , most insurance companies protested that the Federal Government was proposing a massive raid on their territory . Once they found that they could n't lick medicare , many insurance men decided to join it . For months , dozens of private companies have been competing for one-year renewable contracts , under which they would become " fiscal intermediaries " between the Government and the nation 's 6,471 registered hospitals when medicare goes into effect . Last week , pronouncing the occasion " the beginning of a partnership of great promise , " Health , Education and Welfare Department Secretary John W. Gardner awarded the first of these contracts to three organizations that already have health plans covering more than 82 million people : the Aetna Life &; Casualty Co. and the Travelers Insurance Companies , both of Hartford , Conn. , and the giant Chicago-based Blue Cross Association . <P> <P> On the surface , the job would seem to offer only a vast and thankless chore . The three will be responsible for making payments to and supervising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion the first year . In return , the intermediaries will get only their administrative expenses . Still , there are some hidden assets . Insurance companies are planning supplemental policies to provide a host of benefits-hospitalization beyond 90 days , post-hospital drug expenses , etc. - not available under medicare . By their direct access to some 18 million persons eligible for medicare , the intermediaries will have the inside track on such policies . Moreover , as John Budds-who will head Travelers ' medi care effort-explains , the intermediaries will be placed " in direct or indirect contact " with millions of oldsters ' relatives under 65 . This should give them an unsurpassed lead to the sale of insurance of all sorts .
