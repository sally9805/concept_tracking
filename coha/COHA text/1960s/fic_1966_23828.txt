The Honeymoon A story by V. S. Pritchett The ceremony was over . We were married . The registrar who had done seventeen weddings that morning and who stood at a table between two vases of chrysanthemums , said , " It is the custom , if the parties so desire , to embrace , " Victoria , who was very small and hated anyone telling her to do anything , tipped her head back to avoid being kissed but I bent down and gave her two pecks on the brim of her hat and one , at last , on her cheek . Surprised , she kissed me . My mother-in-law , mistrustful of our Town Hall , said , " They have wallpaper on the walls . I did n't realize that . " We signed and then Victoria and I went out first down the long corridor and , since I felt I was walking three inches above the floor , I was puzzled by the marble echoes raised by my shoes . A photographer walked backwards before us . Outside , our party stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Harry  --  the best man  --  standing at the back , On the wallof a warehouse across the street I saw a notice saying , Do Not Obstruct This Entrance . Then we drove off to my mother-in-law 's house and I do n't remember much more about it all , except a caf ? - au- lait feeling that I had joined something average , and except Harry saying , when we got to the wedding-cake stage , " When she cuts , clap . " The photographs were rushed around in the afternoon , and it is all a blank until we went off to the station to catch the London train . There Harry did something I would never have thought him capable of ; it was the sort of thing he detested : he led the confetti-throwing . It snowed on us . He flung it . He tried to stuff some down my neck . It was very dry and thick . He went mad , is all 1 can say . Something broke in me , too . My teeth were wet . I suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ; I went for him with my umbrella , chasing him back from the gate into the house . I think I would have half-killed him or , at any rate , made him 60 THE HONEYMOON bleed , if my father had not dragged me back to the car . As we drove off , I opened the car window and shouted , " My umbrella ! My umbrella ! " They had taken it from me and I could see my father propping it carefully against some shrubbery . " The swine ! " I said , brushing off the confetti , and then I looked at Victoria 's face and stopped . " My wife , " I thought . I could n't believe it . She looked as sweet and tender as a kitten ; she was pouting and blushing , and when I put my arm around her waist I could feel the layers of silk moving over her soft body . How heavenly women are ! For two years she had held out against marrying me ; but now , in a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hen I look back on it I see the idea that I should marry Victoria was not mine alone . All her relations and friends wanted me to marry her . Harry wanted it most of all and everyone agreed with Harry that he should not marry her . The opposition came from Victoria . Harry was the man she wanted , and Harry wanted only himself . He loved his own wavy dark hair , his own pale complexion , his own romantic lips , his satanic side-glances , his clothes . He was a dandy and more than that . He loved himself as he was , as he would he , and even as he had been in history . We worked in a big shoe shop in the town and when there were no customers and we had nothing to do , he used to make drawings of himself as Sir Walter Raleigh , in India ink , on old shoe boxes . One day he said to me , eyeing me sideways and stroking his chin , as if he had a pointed beard on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a conspirator . " At the end of my first day , when I was taken on at the shop , Harry said to me . " I 've got my Vespa at the back . Let 's go somewhere . " Victoria , who worked in the cash desk , must have heard him , but I did n't realise what was going on " I believe in being in the crowd but not of the crowd , " Harry called back to me , as I sat behind him on the Vespa . The next day I saw that Victoria hated me : Harry usually took her home . This slight made her snap and raise her very small nose sharply , so that I gat to know her nose very well , especially the tiny nostrils . It was a dogmatic , sad little nose and that is where I began to fall in love with her  --  from the nose downwards . But after I had gone out once or twice more with Harry , Victoria 's mind was made up . She did all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between me and the manager by making mistakes on the bills and telling me , in front of customers , that I had got prices wrong . One day a woman came in and said I had sent her one crocodile and one lizard shoe  --  Victoria had changed the shoes . These tricks made me laugh and when I laughed she was astonished and all the more determined . But girls always go too far , and the store manager was no fool . One afternoon she saw the foot of the stepladder , which was used to get the shoes from the upper shelves , sticking out beyond the corner of the stock-room door . She gave it a push ? she was very small but she was very strong  --  thinking I was up there getting a pair of 8-1/2 ' brogues for a man who had come in with a fishing rod . But it was Harry who was on the ladder . Down he came , a whole pile of boxes with him . " And what is all this ? " the manager asked pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My ancestor , " said Harry scornfully . It was he who was sacked . He was very pleased . " She 's a nice girl , but I ca n't bear her . She once threw bread at me at a dance , " Harry said . " I shall go to London . " And so Victoria and I were left dumbfounded together . This changed her . She stopped quarreling with me , and I walked home with her several times . I enjoyed the clatter her heels made on the pavement , the way she drove her mother out of the room , and the way she spoke to dogs . I stroked her neck in the park and this made her arch her back with pleasure . She sat on my knee in my lodgings , holding me tight enough to strangle me  --  and started telling me how much she had loved Harry , ever since school , for years . " Harry . " I said . " You mean Sir Walter Raleigh ? " She stiffened . " He has proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " This is where her friends came in and her mother . " Do n't worry , " they said . " It 's all silliness . She 's difficult . Be patient . Be gentle . " But Harry was in London , far away . He came back once for Easter , and the three of us went to a caf ? . " London , " said Harry looking darkly at me , " is the most dangerous city in the world . You have to know your way about . But one can be in the crowd and yet not of it . " V. S. Pritchett 's masterly stories began to appear in this magazine in 1947 ; many volumes have come out since . He is a Londoner and director of " The New Statesman , " and his essays and books span the continents : " The Spanish Temper , " " London Perceived , " and most recently , " New York P  --  oclaimed " ? to be reissued soon in paperback . It was a favorite sentence of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a dummy , " Victoria said . Harry looked sideways at himself in the caf ? mirror , raised a fine darting eyebrow , and smiled at himself . Victoria picked up the remains of her ice cream and intended to throw it all at the mirror so that ( she said afterwards ) he could not see himself ; it hit the glass but splashed over his gray suit . Later he said to me sarcastically , " I congratulate you . Victoria is getting over that nonsense about me . She used to throw bread before . " But he was wrong . Victoria had not changed . In the next two months 1 lost twenty pounds in weight and had pains in the back . The manager asked me to his house to supper and his wife told my fortune . A whole hand of spades came out and I dropped the Queen on the carpet . " You 're surrounded by enemies , " she said . In fact I was surrounded by friends . Within the week I got a letter from Harry telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was getting tired of Harry , Harry , Harry from Victoria with her arms around my neck , and when I heard the news I saw the truth . I had never been in love with her . I even loved the shoe trade better than I loved her , being on my own , away from my parents , too . I got sly . I told Victoria I was leaving the town for good and going to London , that no doubt I should see Harry , and I would make him see what a wonderful girl she was . I was enthusiastic about this . Victoria 's reply exploded inside me : " When do you go ? At the end of the month ? " she asked . " We 'll get married next week . We 'll go to London for our honeymoon  --  that will save money . " I could not believe it . I went to London to fix up the job . She made me promise to come back , the same day . When I returned on the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the platform waiting for me . She rushed at me . She even grabbed me . " I was worried to death . 1 ' 11 never let you out of my sight again , " she said . I was appalled . " I 've found a hotel for us . " " So have I , " she said . " Is n't it wonderful ? " " Harry told me , " I said . " Harry told me too , " she said . " I telephoned to him . " Harry was making sure . It was he if you looked at it like that  --  who got us married . So there we were , married , sitting in the train going to London , I shall not forget the journey  --  four hours ; it seemed like a fortnight . Fields , fields , people picking mushrooms , factories , telegraph poles , fields , towns , back gardens , junc-61 tions . We had a compartment to ourselves . I pulled the blinds on the corridor side after the ticket inspector had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed into a tweed suit and she stiffened . The pout had gone from her lips . Her nose was raised . " You have n't labeled your case , " she said , looking up at the luggage rack . " I did it this morning when you reminded me , " I said , putting my arm around her . " I ca n't see it , " she said . I laughed . " It 's at the back , " I said . And I turned the case around to show her the label hanging down . She still did not believe me . " Look , " I said . She was small enough to lift onto the seat , and I lifted her to see the label . " It 's what I thought . " she accused . " You 've put on the wrong label . " " I haven't. " / read out , " The Austin Hotel , Barna by Street . " " We 're staying at Frenns , " she said . And she showed me the label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Harry told me  --  the Austin . " 62 THE HONEYMOON " Frenns , he said . You know he did , " she said . " I beg your pardon , it was the Austin . " Austin , Frenns , Frenns , Austin  --  so we went on . She got angry . " Mother said you were obstinate , " she said . The train slowed down beside a goods train carrying calves which were lowing . " Those poor things . Prisoners ! " cried Victoria . " Look at them . " She turned on me. accusingly . " Our honeymoon and you do n't know where we 're going . " " The Austin Hotel , " I said . " Here 's the letter confirming our reservation . " I showed her the letter . " The Austin Hotel " was printed at the top of the paper . Victoria was a suspicious girl . She took the paper and read it carefully from the very top edge to the bottom , twice . And then turned it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You see , " I said . " You did this behind my back , " she said . " I 'll alter your labels , " I said , getting out my pen . " Do n't touch them , " she said , taking my pen from me . " After what he 's done to me , do you think 1 would go to a place Harry suggested ? " " He suggested both . " " One to me , one to you , " she said . " He ought to be executed , " I said . " Still , he was only giving us a choice . " " A choice , " she said . " You think it 's funny , do n't you ? What choice has anyone got ? " I glanced out of the window . " A pheasant . Quick . Look , " I called to her . She turned her head . " Two , " she snapped , and sat gloomily looking at her hands in her lap . Once more I put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , moving away from me . " Leave me alone . " She closed her eyes . She could not get comfortable . Crossly she put her head on my shoulder . Suddenly a red-faced young soldier who was shouting to several others slid our door back , gave us a look , winked at me , and made a noise , " Clop , clop , " with his tongue and went off shouting to his friends . " Do n't touch me , I said , " said Victoria . " What is the matter ? " I asked . " Oh , stop asking me what is the matter . You whine . Talk to me . Do n't ask me questions . " The soldiers were bullocking about down the corridor . Of course , when Victoria said , " Talk to me , " that put every idea out of my head . She was silent most of the way to London . What was on her mind ? I knew what was on mine . Houses began to thicken . The train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the name Victoria on it . I nudged her in my excitement . She did not look . We went into tunnels and London flung smoke at us . " We 're nearly there , " I shouted with excitement . She did not speak . She said nothing when we got out of the train at the station , but it was she who said sharply to the cab driver before I could open my mouth , " The Austin Hotel . " " Where 's that , miss ? " " Barnahy Street , " I called over her head . London seemed to smell of cold escaping gas , and the houses looked like hundreds of dirty sparrows , and the sky like a rag as we drove to the hotel . There must have been a dozen little brown houses converted into hotels in the street where the Austin was  --  Linden , Stella Maris , Northern , Fitzroy , Malvern , I noticed the names . They looked friendly all together ; one had colored blue and yellow lights around its windows ; ours was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first floor . " The Austin , " it said . " Private Hotel . " Private  --  how nice ! Victoria had said it made her sick when the manager at the shoe shop had told us that he and his wife had had the Bridal Suite at the largest hotel in Ventnor thirty years ago . " Did you pay the taxi driver enough ? I do n't like the way he 's looking at us , " Victoria said to me when the driver had put our luggage out . " He 's looking at the hotel , " I said . An Irish maid came up from the basement to the door , eating something , and said , " Sign here , " and , " Up to the top to Number twelve . " Hearing a whistle from below , she said , " Wait till I put me bloody kettle off . " We went upstairs . It was a tidy , well-polished place , nicely painted , with a fern in a brass pot on every landing . It was wonderfully private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a comb in her hand looked out of a door on the second floor and gaped at Victoria and me. " 1 thought it was Gladys , sorry , " she said . Friendly people . And we heard the Irish maid say to her , as she came up at last , " It 's the honeymoon couple . " My heart was banging and I felt hungry . There was a smell of steak pudding coming up the stairs , but at the top landing , it had gone . The maid pushed open the door . The room had a double bed with a pretty pink cover on it and there were fancy net curtains at the window , with rabbits and daffodils on them . " Ah , look at me , leaving that this morning , " said the Irish girl , taking away the floor mop she had left beside the dressing table . I waited for the door to close and then I stepped out to kiss Victoria , saying , " It 's clean . It 's at the front . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . My father 's words came back to me . " It may sound a funny thing to say , but when your mother and I were first married , I was taking my shoes off ; I 'd never been in a hotel with your mother before ... " ? well , that is what I felt like when Victoria said she must unpack . I had never seen her unpack . I 'd never seen any woman unpack . First she went all around the room to every corner and cupboard in it , like a cat . And opened all the drawers . She unlocked her cases and out came her dresses . She spread them on the bed and straightened them . One by one out came the new brushes her aunt had given her . Then things for her dressing table . Then she started hanging things and going back to give them a pull or change the coat hanger . Every time she walked across the room ( and it must have been a hundred times ) , the windows shook . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " If you 're not wearing those , hang them up . They 'll get out of shape , " she said . I did not know where to hang them , so I hung them over the door of a cupboard . " They do n't leave you much room , " she said . a story by V. S. Pritchett 63 " What have you done with your shoes ? Look what you 're doing ! Sweep it up . " I had taken off my jacket , and one more shower of Harry 's confetti went on to the floor . " What with ? " I asked and went to look out of the window . An oldish man and a young woman were getting out of a taxi and coming into our hotel ; father and daughter , I thought . The evening was beginning and the neon lights from the Court Hotel opposite began to turn one of our walls red and made Victoria look as if she were blushing . She had finished unpacking . " You leave your things everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She took off her jacket and her blouse and went to the basin . I was suddenly frightened of her , or perhaps it was of the hooks of her brassiere . " And then we 'll go and look at London , " I said , exhausted , and sat on the edge of the bed . The next thing she was asking me for her brown shoes and as I went to look for them she went to the cupboard , stepped out of her skirt , and was halfway into a new dress when I looked around . Suddenly she pulled it off and rushed to the basin . " Go away . Quickly . I feel sick , " she said . " I 'll open the window , " I said . " It 's stuffy in here . " She was n't sick . I helped her to the bed . " Go out . Go for a walk , " she said . " No , " I said . " We 'll go out together . We 'll have 64 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll feel better then . " " No , " she said . I waited . Outside the taxis were passing . " How do you feel now ? " I asked . " Oh , do stop asking me how I feel . All right . Let 's go out . " So we went out . When we got downstairs we met the landlady . She had very large blue eyes and bleached hair . " Comfortable , dear ? " she said to me as she went coldly and rapidly over everything Victoria had got on . " Going to take some air , " I said . " Nothing like it , " said the landlady . Victoria must have been studying her , for when she got outside she said , " She 's been drink-ing . " " She looked like a sofa standing up on end , " T said . Victoria did not laugh . " Perhaps , " I said , " she 'd lost a caster . " Victoria did not smile . Where we went I could not tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of closed shops . I read out the names of them . We passed restaurants . We went to a pub but Victoria would not drink anything . " Are n't you going to eat ? " she said . " They do n't serve food here , " I said . " Oh ! Then why did we come here ? " Of course , as Harry said , you 've got to know your London . He could have told us where to eat . I ought to have asked him . " There 's a place , " she said , pointing to a lit-up cafeteria . And on our way to it , she heard a cat meow and we stopped in an office doorway while she stroked it . It tried to follow us . " Go back , " she said . " Go back . It will get run over . Please ! " Victoria was almost in tears , and we stood there coaxing the cat . Its fur was gritty . I tried to grab it and it jumped from me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately it got across safely and went into a doorway opposite and stared at us . " Suppose it tries to get back , " she said . Her nails were digging into my arm where she was holding it . Well , in the finish , I had a poached egg at the cafeteria . Victoria would not touch hers . And we went back to the Austin . My heart was hammering . A radio was playing on the second floor . I went to the bathroom . When I got back to our room the light was off . I thought Victoria must be in bed , but she was not . The window was wide open and the curtain blowing far into the room . She had gone . And then I saw her . She was sitting in her nightgown on the window with both legs over the sill . I rushed over to her . " I ca n't , I ca n't ! " she cried as I caught her . I had quite a fight getting her in . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never loved you . It is Harry . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . But I ca n't . " She cried and she clung . " I thought I could , but I ca n't . " It was just like our early days but now Harry was cut off from her by our marriage . I could not believe what I heard . I wanted her more than I can say , for her grief and tears , the ugliness of it . and the anger I felt , made her more desirable . " I never wanted to marry you . They made me . You forced me into it . " The little twister , I thought . " It 's a pity Harry is n't here , " I said bitterly . " That 's a dirty remark , " she said fiercely and she stopped crying . Well , 1 thought , I have heard of this happening to people but fancy it happening to me . I saw years of empty life ahead of me . Suddenly she said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we started talking about cats , her mother 's eats , the cats that stalked one another on the garden walls at the back of her mother 's house . She became calm . " You are so understanding , " she said . have done something terrible to you . That is what is so unfair . " " Get into bed . I 'll go and sit over there , " I said . " You 'll catch cold . " She obeyed . Exhausted , I went and sat in the chair by the window , It was a narrow , gray armchair of the furry kind , and the fur pricked through my trousers and my sleeves . no you know what she did , within five minutes ? She fell asleep . The wedding night ! I could hear the whistling noise from her open mouth . There was her whistle , the whipping of the cars going by , the ticking of taxis outside , the hotels , the voices of the drunks after the pubs had closed . It had seemed a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging , lavatories and basins were flushed , pipes jumped . Even at two in the morning people were coming in . On our floor you could hear boots coming off , throats being cleared , the high laugh of a woman once or twice , and heavy bumps on mattresses as if enormous bodies , too big for the beds , had flopped on them . I thought . " I will wait . She did n't mean it , " and took off my collar and tie and loosened my shoes . I was tired out . I must have dozed off . I was dreaming we were in the train and that suddenly I was being sucked out of the window by an overpowering voice that said , " I am Sir Walter Raleigh , " And in a second I was fighting for my life with the manageress of the hotel who was naked and covered with grease . Iwoke up in terror . And then I heard shouts coming from the street . Screams were coming from the stairs of the hotel . I looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw police . They were pushing two or three women into a van . Then I saw a policeman ushering out the manageress of our hotel . She was calling back , I suppose , to the Irish maid , " Ring my solicitor . Phone him up . " Suddenly the door of our room was opened . I turned and a policeman stood there . " Come on . Out of this , " he said , ignoring me and giving the bed a shake . " Here ! " I shouted . Victoria woke up and shouted , " Harry ! " " You keep out of this , Harry , " said the policeman to me . " What do you want ? This is my wife . " " Come on , miss , " said the policeman to Victoria . The cab driver had called her " miss " too . The voice of the Irish maid came up the stairs . " It 's the honeymoon couple . " She got to the room . " It 's the honeymoon couple , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brown suit and the extra jacket hanging on the cupboard . Then he saw the confetti on the floor . " Here 's our reservation , " I said , pushing the letter at him . " What 's this all about ? What do you mean by breaking in ? " The policeman went out to the passage . " Here , who 's this ? " he called down the stairs . Someone answered and he came back . He looked at me contemptuously . " You ought to know better than to bring your wife to a place like this . Take my tip and clear out by the morning unless you want trouble . " " How dare you ! My husband is the assistant manager at Walgrave 's , " shouted Victoria and got out of bed to fly at him , in her nightdress . " Ma'am ! " said the policeman averting his face , " please go back to bed . " And he hurried from the room . " Why , " cried Victoria to me , " did you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Get dressed . I 'm going to ring up the police . " " That was the police , " I said . " I 'm not blind , " she shouted . " Funny place for Harry to know about , " I said . " Come and look . " They were just closing the door of the police a story by V. S. Pritchett 65 van as we looked out of the window . Then we saw people looking out of windows opposite . They were not looking at the police van . They were looking at us . We both drew our heads in and pulled the curtains across . " This was your hotel , not IIarry 's , " she said . " You stayed here . " " I 've never stayed in London in my life , " I said . " Harry said Frenns . " Frenns , Austin , Austin , Frenns  --  we were off again . " Harry told us both of them , " I said . " There must be something wrong with Harry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world but not of it , " I said . She went to the chest of drawers and began taking her clothes out . " I 'm going now , " she said . " Where , at three in the morning ? " " I 'm going . Get my dresses . Do n't drag them on the floor . Look what you 've done . " She dressed . We packed everything up . We carried our luggage downstairs . The bedroom doors were open . In the office of the manageress a policeman was sitting with the Irish maid . They looked at us in silence , but afterwards I heard them laughing , The maid was peeping through the curtains as we got out into the street . We walked . I was lugging the cases and Victoria had one of hers . My arms ached as we trudged . There was no one about . We did not know where we were going . " I wish we had Harry here , " I said . " He could carry one of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads . " And he knows London , " I said . " Come on . " " Where are we going ? " Victoria said weakly . " Where did that eat live ? " I asked . We passed a small open square with a seat in it . " This will do , " I said . " We ca n't stay out , " she said . Suddenly I saw a taxi coming slowly toward us like a housefly along the black , glassy street . I hailed him . I told him to go to the station we had arrived at . " I 'll put you back on the morning train . " I said . " You can have a sleep at the Station Hotel . I need a sleep myself . I 'll get a couple of rooms . " And that is what we would have done but when we got there I did n't like to ask for two singles ; it did n't seem respectable and I did n't like the look the night clerk gave us .
