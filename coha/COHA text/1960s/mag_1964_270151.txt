The Morality Issue <P> Sir : As the American version of the Profumo scandal comes from the White House , the future of this nation requires some truthful and objective answers . If the 1959 morals arrest that is now revealed indicates Jenkins ' vulnerability to Soviet blackmail during these years , and if this dangerous fact has been concealed by President Johnson , then the fitness of this Administration not only to govern but to defend this nation from its enemies must be examined . <P> <P> BILL DEMING <P> Hollywood <P> Sir : Re Walter Jenkins : I wonder how many more unsavory characters are in the Johnson Administration . <P> ( MRS . ) MARY CRUNKER Savage , Minn . <P> Sir : I trust that the American people will be able to evaluate and vote on the real issues whatever malicious scandal Dean Burch succeeds in dredging up . However shocked we may be about the private morals of public officials , the U.S. can not be persuaded that the public moral problems of civil rights , nuclear war , poverty and prosperity are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAKER Minneapolis <P> Sir : It is with great disappointment that I see America 's " leading clergymen " have thought it ethical to use their power , pulpits and journals as instruments for influencing politics Oct. 9 . This action appears even more ludicrous in view of the scandals that have been characteristic of the Johnson Administration . Why has there been no mass clerical denunciation of the Bobby Baker scandal ? Certainly the respectable clergy can not be blind to the lack of morality in high offices and widespread disregard of the law that are now so prevalent in our country . <P> EDWARD HERNANDEZ Los Angeles <P> Sir : So William Sydnor says that those of us who are voting the Goldwater-Miller ticket are not Christians and are committing the sin of ardent nationalism . Since when , may we ask , is patriotism a sin ? Evidently he believes that there is only one way to achieve brotherly love and world peace-by voting the Democratic ticket . May we suggest that he check into the personal integrity and character of both Mr. Goldwater and Mr. Johnson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries . <P> <P> BARBARA B. PUCKETT ELIZABETH H. BABB Richmond <P> Sir : What a commentary on the mixed-up American way of life that practitioners of medicine , entrusted with the job of ministering to our mentally ill , should allow themselves to be a pawn in the cheap journalistic efforts of Ralph Ginsburg Oct. 9 . That professional men of such stature should be taken in by such an obvious political smear is indicative of the days in which we are living-days of compromise and diluting of principles , days when sin is labeled as " error , " when morality is relative and when materialism emphasizes the values of expediency and the shirking of responsibility . God help us to choose wisely Nov. 3 . <P> <P> H. L. BAILEY <P> Chicago <P> Mr. Humphrey 's Wet Peanut
