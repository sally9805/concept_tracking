The first Roman Catholic Mass in the English version approved by the bishops of the U.S. was celebrated last week in St. Louis ' Kiel Auditorium during the 25th Annual Liturgical Week Conference-and the verdict of most liturgists was : needs work . " We used perhaps 20 translations that were already in existence , " says the Rev. Frederick McManus , the new president of the Liturgical Conference . " It 's purely experimental and provisional . The whole thing has to be done over . " The text should be made " simpler and more meaningful , " added Joseph Cardinal Ritter after celebrating one of the four Masses during the conference . <P> Most criticisms stressed the Mass 's " rough spots . " Bishop Charles Buswell of Pueblo , Colo. , suggested that " we need to get the you-who out of the Gloria , " meaning the part that now goes : " You , who take away the sins of the world , have mercy on us . You , who take away the sins of the world , receive our prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father , have mercy on us . " <P> In one place where a you-who might help , it is missing . Agnus Dei , qui tollis peccata mundi , miserere nobis has been translated as " Lamb of God , who take away the sins of the world , have mercy on us . " Better grammar might have been to change " take " to " takes . " Many Catholic missals say " takest , " but the makers of this Mass tried to avoid thee-thy-thou forms . Nevertheless they slipped up : the Lord 's Prayer still goes , " Thy kingdom come . " Other parts have a ring of transliteration , rather than translation , from Latin . " Priests who translate the Mass have a tendency to use Latin derivatives , whereas Anglo-Saxon is generally shorter and sharper , " said one Benedictine monk . <P> Father Robert W. Hovda of Fargo , N. Dak. , a member of the board of directors of the Liturgical Conference , says : " We need to get literary people involved . We have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general use in the U.S. on Nov. 29 , and it will have to suffice until a more felicitous one can be fashioned .
