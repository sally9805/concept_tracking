Millions of Latin Americans last week saw the President of the U.S. , arms flung wide in greeting , flower petals stuck to his pink and sweating scalp , a delighted grin on his face , as he rode down stately boulevards , through exotic cities , among multitudes of strange people . And somehow , whenever he made contact with the people , Dwight Eisenhower 's radiant personality touched the Latinos , and the millions cheered . In the warmth of the uproarious welcome for the norteamericano President , old animosities and old suspicions melted perceptibly . <P> These were the same Latinos whose envy of their prosperous northern cousins has festered for a century , who bitterly recall the bygone days of Yanqui imperialism , and who just as bitterly accuse the U.S. of neglecting them and leaving them to their own destiny . As he moved through South America last week , President Eisenhower heard some pointed talk about Latin American aspirations and the need for U.S. aid , and he countered with some pointed observations of his own-about the peril of tyranny by subversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frank talk , the cheers and the sensation of renewed friendship left no doubt that Ike 's remarkable sally into personal diplomacy was having the same telling effect in Latin America that it had in the lands of Europe , North Africa and Asia . <P> <P> Seven Vivas . Eisenhower 's arrival in Brazil almost turned into a slapstick comedy worthy of the Marx brothers . When the big presidential jet , Air Force One , set down at the airport of the unfinished capital city of Brasilia , a ground crew began unrolling a huge red carpet , miscalculated the distance and arrived at the ramp of the plane with a dismaying roll left over . For a moment it looked as though the President of the U.S. might have to hurdle the carpet before he set foot on Brazilian soil , but an enterprising MATS ground crewman saved the situation by quickly cutting off the extra roll with his pocketknife , tucking the ragged edge under the ramp . <P> The arrival was further complicated by Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek , who had received a false report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breathless appearance 14 minutes after the Air Force One had landed , and not until then did Ike emerge from his plane , but with complete decorum and a friendly pat ( " I understand perfectly " ) for Kubitschek . <P> In Brasilia the two Presidents issued a platitude-clouded statement reaffirming hemispheric solidarity , then flew down to Rio and a picture-book welcome . At Galeao Airport , the peripatetic President boarded a white-hulled launch for the ceremonial trip across the beautiful harbor to the city . As his launch passed a line of 14 freshly painted naval vessels , * the crews raised their white caps high and gave a traditional Brazilian navy greeting-seven " Vivas . " An informal flotilla of small craft trailed in Ike 's wake , a swarm of helicopters chop-chopped overhead , and along the seawall a long formation of white-uniformed sailors and officers stood under the blooming mimosa trees , at rigid attention .
