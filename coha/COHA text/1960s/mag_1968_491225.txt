March 11 , L ? 191.37 , a small , gray-and-blue airplane with a rose , symbol of its home city . painted on its tail , took off from Portland , Oreg. , bound for San Francisco . Aboard were Alvin F.

They were instituting a routine communications search - calling all airfields along the route the plane was to have followed . The news did not disturb Kim . " I told them not to sweat it , " the son said . - If I knew my dad , they 'd find him sitting at some little airfield up the line , having a cup of coffee .

The deep snow . over the thick , springy underlayer I if buried brush . cushioned the fall . The three passengers were injured but alive . While they waited for help . Phyllis then began keeping a diary . " Sat . Mar. 11 , " the first entry read . " .. plane on left side in snow hank . Fuselage broken . Door ajar , windshield , right side windows broken .

Al Saturday- ight and all day Sunday and all y Sunday night young Oien waited for word , The communications search had turner ) up nothing . The plane from Hamilton had found no trace . Early Monday morning he arranged leave from his job as a Delta Air Lines copilot and flew to Portland to join the search that was being mounted there . For two weeks big HU-16B 's of the 304th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron , an Air Force Reserve unit . swung slowly above the snow-crowned peaks . Each carried two pilots , a navigator . and paramedics trained to jump on rescue missions in the mountains . For young Olen. peering downward into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration . " We 'd pick out a mountain or a hillside to search . and just as we 'd get there a snow flurry would blot it out , " he said " Then we 'd have to hunt another clear area . We had to search in bits and pieces , and we probably never got a good look at more than two percent of the terrain . " Equally frustrated by the weather were the searchers of the California Civil Air Patrol ? " a bunch of well-meaning amateurs. untrained in search procedures . " young Oien calls them , " flying a mishmash of airplanes unsuited for rescue work , in contrast to ' We .1ra the highly skilled fliers of the Oregon Pilots ' Association , coordinated by Bob Dunn and Ralph lcGinnis of the Oregon State Board of Aeronautics . " As the search operations got underway , the last great storm of winter blew in from the sea .

" There was a logging road some 300 feet downslope from the wrecked plane , buried deep beneath the snow . It is possible she did not know when she passed over it . " It was snowing so hard I could n't see 20 feet in front of my nose , and I was miserably lost . .. walking through snow that was waist deep uphill and downhill . After 7 hours of walking , i lost both my shoes and I said to myself . ' To hell with this . If I am going to die I 'd rather die with Mom and Dad ' " Tuesday  --  heavy snow . 11:15 boom each day .

" By this time their NI &; M 's and candy mints had all been eaten , and they opened a small four-ounce jar of plum jam that Phyllis rationed , one teaspoon per person per day . ) " Thurs. ? Carla tried again to get out . Snow too deep and wet and freezing . Al started out after she returned . Sunshine , planes flying . Only nice day so far . 1:15 Al shouted OK across valley on way for help .... " ion this day . the letters revealed , Phyllis tore strips from a blue-and-white-checked blanket and made leggings for Carla , Carla 's feet by then were so swollen that her mother 's size-10 shoes " just exactly myself had nothing II ) do with him fora long time .

He told me to go to hell  --  to get off my dead tail and earn it . I went two years to Reed College , pumping gas at night .

They turned me down because I had only 29 credit ho the rules said I had to have 30 . So I quit the Air Force and went back to Portland to finish on my own . " One night . on an impulse . I called my dad and told him I wanted him to meet my wife , He said , ' Why not ? ' So Sally and I went to see him and his wife , Phyllis . and we all got along fine . Then I started trying to get him and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . ' They know where I am. ' he said . ' Let them come to me . ' He was still The Boss ? hard on himself , hard on everybody around him . He would n't say politely . ' I disagree with you . ' He 'd say , ' Bah-loney  --  you are crazy as hell . ' The thing about it was he was always right . He had no formal education , but I never saw the day when I knew more about anything than he did . " He was a dominant man .... He came out from South Dakota when he was eight years old to work in the logging camps . He started off as a whistle punk , the kid who gets up before daylight to build the hires . He got to be a choker setter , putting the big chains on the logs so they could he hauled . He worked hard all his life  --  physical labor  --  not desk work . When he quit logging and started his own wood-hauling business , selling firewood , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wood business and bought the hotel . he did alt the rough repairs himself  --  the carpentry , roofing . plumbing . A union organizer came by one day and told linn he could n't wash the hotel windows without a union card . He got down off the ladder and decked the guy with one punch . He was getting a little heavy  --  up around 220. but he was still strong as a bull . His neck and shoulders were so big Phyllis had to make his shirts . " Al Oien was impetuous , impatient of detail . a somewhat disorganized businessman who kept his books in his hat . Phyllis . who had been a nurse . was calm . orderly . methodical , a compulsive planner and list maker . His cubbyhole office was a clutter. the walls pasted over with wise sayings and allegedly humorous cards : " For a safe Fourth do n't buy a fifth on the third , " for example . under a picture of a four-eyed man . Her house was as immaculate as a hospital operating room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . His bland disregard for orderly forms at times exasperated her . He was 59 . She was 44 . When she had urged him to make a will , he had teasingly put her off . She had persisted , and one purpose of this journey was to visit Al Oien Jr . in Dallas , where the two men would begin to straighten out the elder Oien 's business affairs . There was another purpose  --  to gel Carla away from Portland for a while . There was a strong streak of the stern Victorian father in the senior Al Oien. and Phyllis 's unhappy first marriage had left her with a feeling of cynicism toward dewy-eyed romance . These attitudes had begun to affect Carla Corbus 's feelings toward her mother and stepfather . As a little girl . she had been on warmly affectionate terms with Al Oien . " Sing your Di-dee-di song , Daddy , " she would say , and the tough ex-logger would roar out a wordless melody in a rasping monotone , He had taught her to love flying . fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared a love for books , music , gardens and saddle horses . Now there was an interest in her life she could not share with either of them . At 15 , with all youth 's bright promise of happiness before her , she was in love . But the tall , studious 17-year-old who was her first sweetheart was n't welcome at her house . Al Oien Sr. , had left the plane on Thursday . Friday , in fog and rain , Carla made her way to a little creek for water . " Heard shouts and answered about 2:30. " she wrote . Later they thought they heard the beat of a helicopter 's rotors . They waited and waited  --  and no one came . Saturday and Saturday night were freezing cold . The temperature was still 30 degrees at 9:30 on Sunday morning . In Phyllis 's notation for the day there crept the first faint note of despair . " Fog blowing off , " she wrote . " Carla for Ivater  --  lost most on way hack by slipping . Our 9th day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al did not make it to help . Have heard no planes . " this weekend the air search O reached a high point of activity . On Saturday . March 18. there were 19 Civil Air Patrol search planes in the air . On Sunday there were 25 , for a C.A.P . search is , in the main , a weekend operation . At the airfield in Medford , Oreg .. from which Oregon search planes flew crisscross missions over the mountains . a tall . soft-spoken youth ran to meet each returning pilot with an unspoken question that required only a shake of the head for an answer . Rick hatter-man , Carla 's 17-year-old boyfriend , had heard on the radio in Portland that Carla 's plane was missing . He took all his money ? about S20- and rode a bus to Medford. where he slept in a hangar . Rick and Carla had a secret . They already had planned their engagement and marriage . After his despairing slay in Medford . Rick took the secret with him back to Portland , and that summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookout on a fire tower in the Lewis River region in Washington . " I tried to read , and could n't , " he said . " I thought about her all the time , hoping every time the supply plane came to drop mail and papers that there would be some news of her .. . nn Tuesday , March 21 , the diary entry was a cry of desperation . To the realistic Phyllis it now was clear that they might never be found alive . " Overcast . 120g , " the notation began . " Planes seem to be flying down our valley , tho too high to see us . Have lost all hope . Suggest suicide pills in first-aid kits . Ca n't try to walk out  --  snow too deep .... Will stay here until gangrene. cold , or malnutrition gets us . " On this day Phyllis and Carla together struggled to the little stream . " Treacherous trip . " they recorded . " cold and wet on return . Exhausted . Too weak . " To keep their minds occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter , a somber and chilling book about , airline flying . written by a pilot . Almost prophet ica ly Ph y I is had brought along newspaper clippings telling the story of the unsuccessful search for Amelia Earliart , serialization of a recent book . They made listsof things they wanted most . " Bath . . . flat , level , warm bed . Enough head space to sit up .. relaxation  --  nerves shut . sleep . " Wednesday . March 22. was their 11th day . " Cold , windy . foggy , overcast . " They had one day 's ration of jelly left . The rainwater caught in Carla 's bathing cap was gone . and the snow around the plane was dirty . Thursday night they caught more water . " . . . wretched nite . Poured again . Cabin a dripping sieve . " They had crumpled up maps to stuff in the cracks through which the water leaked . Their feet were now much worse . " Terribly swollen . Toes purple , ' ' Phyllis wrote . " Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery . Phyllis was having " stornack cramps and associated aches . " The day brought snow , rain . hail , snow . alternating with high winds that shook the plane . ( " Daddy estimated them before he left at 50 mph , " Carla wrote in a letter . " These seemed twice as strong . " ) " Making new life plans and goals , " Carla wrote in the diary . " Concerned about boyfriend , horse , and two dogs . Ca n't sleep . Mind occupied with thoughts of food . . . . " They made long lists of things to eat . " Potroast . . . hot chocolate . . . hamburgers . . . French fries . . . macaroni and cheese . . . pancakes and sausage .. . hot fudge sundae .. . . " Friday , March 24. was their 13th day . " Beautiful clear blue , cold , sunny day . " the diary recorded . " No more food or pills , on a strictly ice diet . Carla 's feet improving , Phyllis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pessimist . Trying to decide who will get valuables if we die . Intend to write letters concerning inheritance . " Saturday , March 25. there was a high overcast . " . . . enough room to fly , " the chary noted . " but hardly any planes . . . . " In a letter . Carla wrote , " The planes seem to tease us , flying just out of sight above the clouds . " B y this time , in Oregon and Cali- fornia , , the search planes were leaving the sky  --  waiting for the spring thaw to show them what lay under the snow . Only young Dien , in a rented light plane , stubbornly continued the search . By so doing , he believes , he learned what must have happened to his father 's plane . " While I was searching for him , the same thing almost happened to me , " he said . " I was flying out of Yreka . California , searching the Klamath River Canyon , when the weather started moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly the highway . heading back toward Yreka. when I began to run into snow flurries . I started to climb . and at 10,500 I broke out into blue sky , though all around me the cumuli went up another 2.000 feet or more . I did n't want to get trapped in Yreka by the weather , so I began ( lodging around them , heading north into Oregon . Then , all at once , flying through a big , blue hole between the clouds . I lost everything . Sky , horizon , everything disappeared . " The little plane he was piloting had no instruments for blind flying  --  not even a needle and ball . Oien , trained to fly jets in any kind of weather , was hopelessly trapped in a white cocoon . He did the only thing he could do in that situation . He let the plane fly itself . He took his feet off the rudder pedals and held the stick delicately between thumb and forefinger , hoping that the aircraft would keep goingstraight and level . For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nrintae unwind , and the noise of the around the cockpit increased , and he knew he was in a spiral . going down . " Pilots have a name for that maneuver , he said . " They call it the death . spiral , Annydouyonuavheala , engyoctietaorgaeitr obeli tneoaf tiht yf aosut you can kick the plane into a flat spin , fall out of the clouds , and pull it out before it hits the ground . But these Clouds were what the Oregon pilots call cumuli ponderosa  --  they had pine trees in them . So the first thing to do was st itloeps stick the descent , teos cbernti n , g f at ( lie . n1 ohsae uul epd , ba na cdk t on he altimeter steadied . Next came the tricky part . You have no way of knowing whether you are spiraling down to the right or to the left . The seat of your pants tells you nothing . You know you 've got to roll in some aileron , and you 've got just two choices  --  right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flying blind . " Again he let the plane fly itself . Again the deadly spiral started , and again he pulled it out . This time , he broke into clear air . Ahead of him was a town with a highway running through it . To the east there was an airstrip . It all looked strangely familiar . He was not over Oregon . headed north , as he had thought . Ile was back over Yreka , Calif .. headed south . - Sipping coffee in the Yreka hangar , letting his nerves calm . it suddenly seemed clear to him what had happened to his father . The weather that had trapped him was almost identical to the weather his father had encountered  --  low . broken clouds with showers . high overcast . and above the overcast , cumuli in every quadrant . " The way I visualize it . he was dodging clouds just as I was , when all of a sudden they closed in on him , " he said . " He had instruments , but he was n't an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and the heading constant until he came in the clear again . But there was one thing against him that I did n't have to worry about . He started picking up ice . He could n't keep the plane in the air . So he brought her clown . still flying , and just in the last seconds he must have seen the snowfield coming up . For everything was just as it should be for a forced landing ? power , off , flaps down for maximum lift and minimum drag . And , with big pines all around . he plopped her down on her belly in the only open place . It was a miracle of flying . " F or a few days in late March the weather brightened . " Easter Sunday beautiful day , but no planes . Does n't California have a search and rescue outfit ? " the diary asked . Monday was clear and warm . " We could hear a plane working to the west of us . Maybe he will make it to our canyon tomorrow . Spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowed . but cleared in the afternoon , with sun , blue sky and high winds . " We can hear our plane drowning idroningl around but ca n't see him . We must also be hard to see because of a layer of snow . " Then came the cold again . " Wed . 29 . High wind blowing , high clouds . Only warmed to 35 ' . Obsessed by backache . Carla cold , dizzy , upset .... Have done considerable crying . We just must get out of here . " The one-piece wing had broken away from the fuselage . The body of the plane lay under it , tilted on its left side . There was no entry or exit except through the broken windshield , The left-side windows lay beneath them in the snow . The right door was above them , pushed shut by the weight of the snow-covered wing . The bottom , crunched in as the plane bellied formed the right wall . The top had become the left wall . The two women slept , curled together for warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the size of a telephone booth . They had more room after Al had gone , but they missed his body heat . Thursday , March 30 . Again it snowed , " a lite dry snow , " but deep enough to cover the plane and make them invisible from the air . Their last food a spoonful of jelly  --  had been eaten a week before . Groping in their luggage , they found vitamins , toothpaste and milkof-magnesia tablets . " Brushed hair , " the diary noted . " Despondent from snow . " In letters they wrote that they measured themselves with a piece of yarn and a ruler . Each had lost at least five inches of waistline and about 30 pounds . " I used to look pretty good in a two-piece except for my big legs . " Carla wrote . " Now they are as slender as the rest of me . Ca n't wait to see how I 'll look in a dress . . . . " It snowed all Thursday night and Friday morning , and by Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the plane . They dug out to find blue sky above them , and into their diary entries there crept an almost euphoric note . " Spirit and hope soaring . " the diary read . " Feet getting better , Our April Fool is on Fate . Surely will be seen in the next week . " Sunday . April 2 . " Beautiful sunny day , no planes . Are n't they looking for us at all ? Health seems to improve  --  surely we are meant to get out of here , " Dy now the official search was over . C.A.P . planes had made 351 flights for a total of 593 hours in the air . Unhappily , most of the effort had been concentrated in mountains far to the north of where the plane had fallen , Al Oien Jr .. persisted . but he also was searching far away to the north . Once . in July , the southern limits of his search brought him within five miles of where the plane lay . now free of snow and perfectly visible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 just could n't believe they could have gotten that far south without making it all the way , " young Oien said . " A quarter mile to the west , two minutes farther south  --  they would have been safe . " A fter the early April entries . the diary notes grew briefer and more despairing , like voices fading into the distance . A wet snow , freezing the tarpaulin over their windshield exit , trapped them in their aluminum shell . " The weight of the snow is pushing the cabin down , " they wrote . " It is getting hard to move around . . . We have been here one month today , " they wrote on April 7 , On Saturday , April 8 ? " Got the canvas open finally , sky clearing somewhat . Occasional sun . " It did not last , Two days of rain and hail followed , then snow . " We think we are completely buried and can not possibly get " The two slept , half *Wisp , half 1009 , in a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our hopes are dubious , " they wrote on April 11 . On April 12 , still sealed in , they could hear planes above them . The roof was crushing in under the weight of snow . April 13 . " Still ca n't open the canvas . It seems frozen solid . Cabin is sinking . We are dripping like a sieve . " From here the diary entries grow almost telegraphic in their brevity , reporting only the altimeter reading . and whether the day was dark or bright . which they could determine by the light that filtered through the covering snow . " Tuesday . April I8 ? A little lighter out , altimeter still up . Do n't care if we live or die but wish either one woub hurry . " " Monday , April 24 ? More planes than usual  --  will we be found ? Now worried where to get snow . Roof sinking or plane tipping a tiny bit each day . Roof starting to leak more . Please hurry , someone . " Now come the last days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very wet inside , " the diary notes . On Saturday , April 29 . Carla wrote : " Brighter day ? Sun we think  --  some passing clouds . Tomorrow is my 16th birthday . " Then ? " Sun Ap 30 ? Today is my 16th birthday  --  I wanted to be rescued today , It would have been nice . Very bright day . Lots of sun .... Maybe we will get out of here soon . " It was the Iasi Iii ) te of hope . Monday . Tuesday . Wednesday , the brief record continued " Sunny only wished something would happen . . . . we are soaking wet . . Our beds are puddles . " Finally , on Thursday . May 4 ?

Bolling awl his wife , Hilda , left the little town of Shasta in the mountains of Northern California to ride the ridgetops looking for deer . Eight miles south of the main highway . on a logging road deep in the hills . Bolling stopped his sta tion wagon . With high-powered binoculars he slowly scanned the nearby slopes . Three hundred yards away , across a little valley , in a brushy , bowl-like depression 1,000 feet below the top of Shoemaker Bally , he saw the glint of sun on metal . Leaving his wife at the truck , Bolling made his way across the little valley and along the slope . floundering through chaparral , buck-brush and tan-oak scrub so thick that four times he fell sprawling , " I was getting so scratched up I was about to give up and turn hack , " he said . " Then all of a sudden I saw it , not more than twenty feet away . It was n't torn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen in these mountains . It was lying slantwise to the slope . and you had to look a second time to see it was badly damaged . " I hollered to my wife to leave her rifle at the car and come on over , and we stood there for a minute or two wondering what to do . There was nothing we could do to help anybody . for whoever had been m the plane had been dead a long time . But we knew we had to notify the sheriff and the coroner . and we ( eight to have some identification to take along . So I reached in through the broken windshield and got a suitcase . and my wife took a little plastic hag with a stationery box in a that had some writingon it . and we went back to the car and headed back for Redding the county seat of Shasta County . Pretty soon we met a hunter who had a telephone in his pickup . and we asked him to call Redding and tell the sheriff what we had found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . and we went back toward the plane , so when the sheriff came we could lead him to the place . " While they waited , Hilda Bolling took the box out of the plastic hag and read the message on it . In a firm but uneven hand , someone had written : " Whoever finds this wreck  --  please mail these letters for us . We waited so long for you- - where were you ? Our daily log is here too for you to see in the folded Airman 's Guide . " The letters in the box were stamped , addressed and sealed , and the Bollings did not open them . But they did read , on a sheet of stationery decorated with two fuzzy , sleepy-looking baby owls , the messages and calendar that are reproduced on page 32 . Carla had drawn a star around the 30th of April and written beside it : " This would have been my 16th Birthday .

From here Al Chen , with a broken arm . broken ribs and an injured back . had plunged into snow up to his armpits and struggled off to get help . Here . in the plane 's broken cabin .

It was a young girl 's warm and tender expression of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to make her life full and happy  --  her thanks for the piano and music lessons , the saddle horse and the riding Itssons , the ballet lessons and the pretty party dresses ... , " I know you had always wanted me to be a little lady , and I feel that I am beginning to fulfill your expectations . " Carla wrote . " But now , I do not know whether I will be given the chance . We are hoping for the best . I am planning my new life with Mother . . . Regal , white-haired . unbending. only the trembling of her hands as she held the letter betrayed the grandmother 's emotions . " I only scolded her once , " she said . " She came romping in from play , gasping and panting , exaggerating her exhaustion as little girls will do , All I said was , ' Carla , little ladies do not &realize; that way . . . had such plans for her , such wonderful pla , ns . " She touched the letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except at four o'clock in the morning . when I wake up . . . and then I know it is true , and I can not go back to sleep . .. She read Phyllis 's letter silently . " So like Phyllis , " she commented , putting it away . " Philosophical and unsentimental . " Phyllis expressed herself with blunt realism . To Al Oien 's brother in Ladner , S.D .. she wrote . " Dear Percy : When you receive this letter . Al , Carla . and I will all be dead .... Carla insists that since we were not killed outright we were meant to live and will he rescued . I 'm beginning to wonder . In 2 weeks we 've had nothing but snow to cat . We are living off our fat . " She then assured Percy Oien that " Al was really very good to us . . we had 9 good years . " In letters to her brother , Robert Hausheer , in Wilmette . BL and to Al Oien Jr .. in Dallas , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver-framed picture of William Corbus , her first husband ; a diamondand-ruby ring that he had given her , a Corbus family heirloom ; a sapphire lavaliere that had been her mother 's . In her letter to Al Oien Jr .. she made an inventory of the things that should be looked for at the plane once it was found , " We have here about $300 in cash , the movie camera , plane tickets , my rings , pearl pendant , pearl ring , my watch , Al 's ring and watch . . . . " Only rarely in her letters did she give way to bitterness or self-pity . " It sure is difficult to exit From life this way , " she wrote in one letter . Such a waste . " Her sorrow was for Carla . " Looks like I 'll exit before you do , " she wrote to her father . who is 79 , and has had a series of strokes . " It has n't been an easy life , and I hate to sit here and watch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asperations . . . . " Then , almost as if ashamed of this brief display of sentiment . she closed with a curiously flippant signature , " Well , tally-ho . Nul sed . Our love . " eitting in his blue pajamas in an ? Z easy chair at the home of his son in Wilmette , Walter E. Hausheer , Swiss-born exporter of medical supplies , leafed through a bulky scrapbook . " This was her birth announceniet he said , pointing to a tiny with card pink ribbon on it . ' Phyllis Jean ? ieht , a " Hausheer ? Dec. 21 , 1922 . ' I was a Swiss citizen then , and I registered her birth in the town hall in Zurich .. . When she reached high-school age . I came to Evanston so that she could attend the best high school in the U.S , She graduated in science at Northwestern . She became a nurse . When she was the nurse in charge of the polio ward at the Evanston Hospital . she was very severe , very correct , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ic took the letter she had writO him and replaced it in the scrapboos . " And now I make the last entry . " he said . It was a clipping from a Portland paper . reporting that at a local funeral home a brief service had been held for Phyllis Jean Oien and her daughter Carla . Burial had been in Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery with only members of the family and close friends attending . He closed the book . K neeling under a pine tree that towered over the brushy slope where the Bollings had found his father 's plane . Al Oien Jr .. pondered a contour map laid out on the ground before him . The plane , which had not fallen in Shasta . but just over the line in Trinity County , had already been dragged down the hill to a sandy spot and bulldozed under . In the tangle of brush where it had lain , George Files . the coroner . was making one last search . He found the coat that Phyllis Oien was wearing when she died , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar . He found the heavy sweater Phyllis had knit for Carla , and Al Uien 's slip-on shoes , and an aviation map , folded to an illustration showing how to give distress signals from the ground . He found the battered portfolio in which Al Oien carried his maps . There was evidence that brown-haired Carla had used it as a pillow as she died . This final tidying-up of the wreck site marked for the younger Oien the end of one long quest , the beginning of another . When the official search was abandoned , he had stubbornly gone on . Taking leave from his co-pilot job , he had rented a small single-engine airplane . Throughout the spring and summer he had carried on his own lonely and dangerous search , circling the Beaks and ridges . flying so low that his wing tips brushed the treetops . He had failed , and failure had left him with a brooding sense of guilt  --  the feeling that he had let his father down . To exorcise that guilt , he now was setting out upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . A deep-eyed , moody , slow-spoken man . young Oien studied the map spread out on the ground before him . The day he left was their first clear day , " he said . " That meant that in this direction ? to the north and northwest  --  he could see for miles . " He poked at the map with a pencil . " So to me it is pretty plain . He came this way  --  to the west . He followed this contour here , at about the level of the plane , along this ridge line where we are now . And he stood just about where we are now , and yelled ' OK ' across this little gully that lies between us and the plane . " He checked a diary entry . " They said , ' Al shouted ? across the valley . ' In the winter it would have looked like a valley to them . And then he went on to the west , following this ridge line as it bends around to the south . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt , and set off through the heavy brush , clawing and scrambling and scratching his way along the slope . An hour later he came out , panting , at a clear place overlooking a deep valley that falls away steeply to the south , cut by steep-walled canyons and rough-timbered ridges . " From here . " he said , " he could see brown ground , bare earth , the end of .. snow  --  flat country for four hunited miles all the way to Bakersfield . I am convinced that this is the way he went  --  or tried to go . And down there is where I 'm going to look for him . If my dad is down there . I will find him . It will just take time . " That night at Weaverville , the county seat of Trinity County . Sheriff Tom Kelly left his supper to meet Al in his office at the courthouse . He is a big , bronzed , affable man , a onetime mountain guide and packer , and a former Navy pilot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your dad , " he said to Al . . r Al laid out his map on the sheriff 's desk . " That 's right , " he said . " And I was hoping you would ask the Job Corps people to help me . " The sheriff looked at him . He spoke very gently . " Al . " he said , " we 've already had two hundred and forty Job Corps people up there at the wreck . We lined them up five feet apart and sent them down this valley all the way to the highway . We told them to look under every bush . They did n't find a thing . " " That 's the point , " Al said . " They did n't find anything because he did n't go down that valley . All he could see clown that valley was snow . so he went west and then turned south , " " AL " the sheriff said , " all he could see in any direction was snow . Anyhow , we had Job Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Keeler from Shasta County was in there with his bloodhounds . Between them they covered all that slope above where the plane was lying , all the way around to the gap . They did n't find a trace . " - " They did n't look far enough , " At said . He put his finger on the map . " I want to go down in this canyon here , and search , it out , both sides . " The sheriff studied the map . " That 's some of the roughest country in the West , " he said . " Even hunters do n't like to go in there . If they kill a deer , they ca n't pack the meat out . If your dad ever got down in that canyon .... " He paused . " Al , these Job Corps kids are n't woodsmen . And that is dangerous country . It would be easy for one of them to get lost or break a leg , or get killed in a fall . So , unless you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or that way  --  I just ca n't see another big search . " Al rose and folded his map . " Guess I should have married a senator 's daughter or something , " he said . " Al , " the sheriff %said , looking at him , " that 's got nothing to do with it . If I thought there was any chance in the world we 'd find your dad alive , we 'd pull the stopper . We 'd go all out . You know that . " " You did n't know my dad , " Al said . " He would n't die easy . " He shook the sheriff 's hand . " Thanks , anyway . " " Jesus , Al ! " the sheriff said , taking his hand . " Why did n't they build a fire ? They had gas in the downhill wing , and a can of oil in the plane , and dry matches . Looks to me like they 'd have set that mountain afire .... " " Good question , " Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good questions . " I young Oien said . driving very fast but with great skill back down the mountain to his base at Redding . " But the answers are all gueses . Why did n't they clean the snow off the wings ? Why did n't they make a toboggan out of part of the plane ? Why did n't they lay out some sort of signal ? It 's easy for us , warm and dry and in no pain , to look at a map and wonder why three cold . hurt , starving people , lost on a mountainside in the snow , did n't do certain things . If they were strangers to me , I 'd say they were dumber than hell . But I know my dad . He is n't dumb . He is tough and smart and calm and levelheaded . " F or Al Oien Jr. , the books will not be closed until he finds his father  --  alive or dead . In Redding , after his talk with Sheriff Kelly at Weaverville , he had gone to the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter , now trainer of the Shasta County bloodhounds . There , while the huge beasts bayed in their kennels . Al Chun laid out his map and explained his theory . He asked for Deputy Keeler 's help . " I have to work the dogs two days a week . " Mr. Keeler said . " I might as well work in there as anywhere else . Anything with a human odor about it . a bone . a scrap of cloth , a shoe , a glove  --  theymill go to it . " At Oien went back to Dallas and to his job . For weeks he Clew his regular Dallas-Los Angeles route . Then , late in the fall , as the weather to the north remained clear , and pilots flying the coastal run reported the mountains still free of snow , he became restless . " It got to eating on me. " he said . " I knew I had to go back . " Then , in November , he asked Delta for another leave and hearted north again . At Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small dog , and drove back to California . Half a mile to the west of the wreck site they set up camp beside their car . For a week they moved out from their camp site . plowing through the thick brush . returning each night bruised and exhausted . The camp was just below the 5,000-foot level . Sometimes at night it was cold with fog , rain , and a hard wind blowing . For the first time he began to understand , just a little . what Phyllis and Carla and his father endured . Far below in the canyon to the south , Keeler worked his bloodhounds , King . Henrietta and Big Red . They found nothing . At his camp in the brush , Al Oien began to pack his gear . " It may be he did n't come this way after all , " he said . " I 'll come back this winter to see how the land looked to him when he started out . Maybe that will give me a better clue as to where to start looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to keep on until I find him . It 's my duty , my responsibility . And until I find his body , I 'll never be convinced that he 's dead . He 's only been gone seven months now . People have lasted longer than that , have n't they ? " 0
