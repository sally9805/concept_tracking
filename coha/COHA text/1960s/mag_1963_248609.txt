PT 109 . Warner Bros. has approached the story of J.F.K. 's 1943 heroism with a reverence usually reserved for a New Testament spectacle : not a chapter or verse of Robert Donovan 's bestseller is omitted . This accounts for the film 's nearly 21-hour running time . It does not account , however , for turning the first hour or so into a miniaturized Mister Roberts . All the old hands are on board . There is the salty Regular Navy-man who makes things tough for the fresh-water PT-boat jockeys ; there are the stock-comic enlisted men with true hearts and rural accents ; there is even the inevitable goldbricker who works always at being transferred Stateside . When this character dares to suggest to Mister Kennedy that with his pull in Washington he could get both of them out of the Pacific in no time , he is scuttled with the reply : " Sorry , Rogers-and I 'm surprised at you . " <P> Both crewmen and superiors are forever saying things to Kennedy that 20 years later they probably wish they had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " splutters one sailor after Lieut , ( j.g . ) Kennedy has accidentally dumped a bucket of dirty water over him . And the running gag all through PT 109 is **61;3562;TOOLONG . But nothing upsets Kennedy 's dedication to duty , and sometimes he sounds as if he were rehearsing an inaugural address at some happier future time . " Think these men will do a good job for us ? " asks Ty Hardin , the 109 's exec as he ponders the crew . " If we do a good job for them , " replies Kennedy . <P> Once the reels of saltwater drag racing are out of the way ( PT 109 wins the race , but smashes into the dock when Cowboy Kennedy slams the engines into reverse at high speed and conks them out ) , the film takes on a measure of verve and dash . Best scene is the nighttime patrol when , running without lights , Kennedy 's PT suddenly comes under the prow of a blacked-out Japanese destroyer and PT 109 's plywood hull is sliced through like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a crackling as the sea becomes molten with flaming fuel , and in the night come the terrified cries of men calling out to their buddies . <P> <P> The real-life yarn of how the survivors made their three-mile swim to the nearest island is good cinema . And for once , the heroics are real , not faked , when , swimming at the head of the burned and dazed men , Kennedy tows one of the worst injured along by holding the straps of his life jacket between his teeth . But once they reach land , the note of **30;3625;TOOLONG surfaces coyly again : one of the crew tosses a pair of waterlogged boots to another , wisecracking : " Put a high gloss on these , porter . They 're for my friend when he gets back to Hyannis Port . " <P> As a vignette of heroism in the far greater story of the war in the South Pacific , PT 109 would have made a serviceable little picture for the double-bill circuits . But blown up out of proportion in deference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yakked up out of believability by miles of comic relief , it has become a wide-screen campaign poster . One merciful antidote : smiling Cliff Robertson has been allowed by Director Leslie Martinson to play Skipper Jack with vigor , not vigah ; there is n't a single hand-stabbing J.F.K. mannerism in sight .
