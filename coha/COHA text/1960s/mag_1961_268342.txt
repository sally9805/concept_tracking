In Bizerte last week , as French and Tunisian troops observed an uneasy ceasefire , they were burying the dead . On the scene , TIME Correspondent Edward Behr reported : <P> At street corners and in courtyards , hastily covered with sacking or blankets , lie hundreds of corpses . Some died in the first day 's fighting and had sprawled in the blazing sun for four days . The stench was overpowering . Everywhere on the fringes of the casbah and inside it were houses wrecked by mortar and artillery fire . Swarms of large black flies buzzed over pools of blood in the streets . For 24 hours after the ceasefire , ambulances , lorries and mule carts brought out the dead and dying . In Bizerte hospital , the wounded lay shoulder to shoulder on mattresses in the corridors . From a personal count of the dead , I estimate that the official Tunisian figure of 670 is accurate , with 1,115 wounded . Civilian casualties outnumbered military casualties by ten to one . <P> The bulk of the death toll came in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when French planes blasted Bizerte for hours , 2 ) two days later when French paratroopers rained grenades and mortar shells on the close-packed houses of the casbah . In . Bizerte , the myth of the poor quality of the Tunisian fighting men finally died . Dirty and stubble-chinned , they clung to their positions . Four Tunisians held up an entire French company for four hours , killing five paratroopers and wounding 15 , and battled on even after two medium tanks had blown to smithereens the houses in which they were sheltered . With howitzers , tanks and planes on one side , and rifles and light machine guns on the other , Bizerte is not a battle of which the French can be proud . <P> During and after the fighting , the paratroopers behaved with all the arrogance that has made them the despair of France and the bane of the French army . It is natural for troops in battle to get their food and drink where they can find it . But the paratroopers carried looting several stages further , in keeping with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tunisian houses and emerged with wads of money , watches and jewelry . They wantonly smashed what they could not carry away . <P> Amazingly , the Tunisians made no individual reprisals against the 180,000 French citizens scattered throughout the country . In all , President Bourguiba ordered the arrest of only 300 Frenchmen , some of whom were released the next day . <P> <P> It is difficult to convey adequately how the Bizerte tragedy has affected Tunisians . " For years we have lived with France and now they do this , " said a dock worker at Bizerte . " One never knows them well enough , does one ? " Dozens of times during the week . Tunisians came up to me to say , " C'est fini ! " From President Bourguiba down to the lowliest peasant , there is the realization that , come what may and even with the passage of time , Tunisians will never trust France again .
