President Kennedy decided weeks ago that a quick tax cut was needed to pep up the sluggish U.S. economy . Most of his economists , including Walter Heller , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , urged him to call for a cut . Yet last week , when he appeared on national television to explain his policy , Kennedy came out not with a tax-cut proposal , but rather with a statement that emergency tax legislation " could not now be either justified or enacted . " <P> What odd thing had happened on the way to the TV cameras ? The fact was that President Kennedy had run into some rutty political detours . It had become increasingly evident that he could not get Congress to approve a quick tax cut ; among those opposing any such move were both Wilbur Mills , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , and Harry Byrd , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . And early in August a Gallup poll reported that 72% of the voters opposed immediate tax reduction if it meant that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy found himself in the position of a business executive who 1 ) drafts a memo arguing that his company should open additional sales offices , 2 ) overhears his boss say he wants to cut costs , 3 ) tears up the memo , and 4 ) drafts a memo arguing that the company should shut down some of its sales offices . <P> Placing the Blame . The result was the Kennedy speech , spiritlessly delivered and political in its every nuance . Implicit throughout was an attempt to blame the present mushy economy on the Republican Eisenhower Administration . " The fact of the matter is that the economy in January of last year was sick , " said Kennedy . " We have had a five-year period where we have been more or less standing still economically . . . When I came into office in January 1961 , this country was in a recession . We have made a recovery from that recession . " Near Kennedy was an easel of charts , prepared to illustrate how the economy has perked up during his Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of 1961 the gross national product has gone up 10% , industrial production 16% , wages and salaries 10% , disposable personal income 8% and pretax corporate profits 26% , while unemployment has gone down 23% . " So this is the story of our economic recovery . The pace thus far this summer , while not as good as all of us would like , has still brought further gains . Economic indicators which have been reported to me for July do not warrant the conclusion that we are entering a new recession . " The President 's statistics overstated-by a considerable margin-the extent of recovery from the 1960-61 recession . The 26% gain in profits , for example , looked very impressive on the chart , but it was measured from a valley in early 1961 , when corporate profits dipped to the lowest level since 1958 . All the 26% increase did was bring profits up to about the level of the second quarter of 1959.
