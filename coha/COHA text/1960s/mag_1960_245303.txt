A shapely brunette in sausage-tight skirt stepped from the shadows to the curb as the small Fiat pulled up . " Good evening , " she chirped to the leering youth behind the wheel . " Want to come with me ? " Just then a cream-colored Lancia sedan eased alongside the Fiat , horn beeping and headlights flicking on and off . Two well-dressed , well-groomed girls smiled invitingly at the young man . " Hello there , want to go for a ride ? ' ' crooned one , ignoring the streetwalker . " Then follow us . " The Fiat roared after the Lancia , and the streetwalker retreated snarling to the shadows . <P> Such scenes were being enacted nightly last week around Milan 's famed Cathedral Square and in Genoa , Como and Rome . " Klaxon girls , " as the Italian press calls them , are the latest product of Italy 's industrial boom , and they may revolutionize the peninsula 's oldest profession . <P> The Pickup . Most klaxoners , known by such names as Yvette of the Opel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discreetly toot horns and flash headlights to attract the prospect 's attention . In a favorite gambit , pairs of klaxon girls pull right alongside male motorists ; the one at the wheel keeps the car just abreast , the other casually unbuttons her blouse . Blonde " Insurance Nadia , " on the other hand , got her name by her habit of gently jostling a male driver 's rear bumper , then sidling out to coo that her insurance company will pay damages , if any-and making her proposition . <P> Klaxon girls , though willing to accommodate pedestrians , prefer motorists-not only because in Italy a car is an assurance of affluence , but also because , as one girl said , " you do n't have to take them back where you found them . " Largely self-employed , the most successful of Milan klaxoners take in as much as $160 nightly , charging about $20 for a ride to a 45-minute assignation in hotel , pension or apartment . Some , starting with a down payment on a tiny Fiat 600 , have worked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reclining seats , recorded music and soft lights . <P> The Lookouts . The klaxon girls are the gaudiest example of an upsurge of prostitution that has occurred since a law sponsored by Socialist Angelina Merlin banned state-supervised brothels in 1958 ( Merlin advocates insist it is only coincidence ) . But last week the Health Ministry reported that cases of syphilis registered in state clinics have doubled since 1957 , and Rome 's II Tempo charged that " the number of prostitutes has shown a marked increase . " Since the Merlin law reforms , prostitutes can be jailed in Italy only when caught in the act . To guard against this misfortune , the klaxon girls have begun mounting lookouts on Lambrettas . Last week Milan 's cops nabbed one such Paul Revere whose duty was to ride ahead of the morals-squad patrol car , warning the freewheeling hustlers that the bluecoats were coming .
