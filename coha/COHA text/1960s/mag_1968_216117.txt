Violinist Alexander Schneider is no dazzling virtuoso . " After I first heard Heifetz , I cried for a week , " he says . Nor , when he conducts an orchestra , is he a prima donna of the podium . Frequently , in fact , he is not even on the podium , preferring to lead unobtrusively from within the ranks with a toss of his head and a wave of his bow . Nor , as an intermittent member of the Budapest Quartet for more than 35 years , has he ever sawed away on anything but the No. 2 violin part . In short , he has made a career of playing second fiddle-and to all but his enthusiastic admirers he remains the dim background figure that second fiddlers are supposed to be . <P> <P> But ebullient , frizzy-haired " Sasha " Schneider is , at 59 , a second fiddler the likes of which chamber music has rarely seen . Whirling like a dervish around the fringes of the limelight , he is not only a tireless performer but also an enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes , music seems to happen around him through a sort of spontaneous combustion . <P> <P> The Organizer . Having persuaded Cellist Pablo Casals to come out of exile and begin performing again in 1950 , Schneider now serves as major-domo of the annual Casals Festival in Puerto Rico . He is one of the guiding spirits of Pianist Rudolf Serkin 's Marlboro Festival in Vermont . An indefatigable organizer of concerts , he has created such benign features of New York City musical life as the free outdoor performances in Greenwich Village and the offbeat chamber series at Manhattan 's New School . A restless exponent of widening the repertory , he once formed a Schneider String Quartet expressly to perform all 83 of Haydn 's quartets . He has been musical godfather to numerous younger musicians , among them Pianist Peter Serkin , Violinist Jaime Laredo , and the Guarneri Quartet . <P> " If you want to be an artist , you have to be a prostitute , " Schneider proclaims in his favorite paradoxical vein . " A prostitute is not ashamed of undressing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionally . The moment you fear showing yourself , stay home . " He prefers the intimacy of chamber music because " it is much more personal than symphony music-you must expose more . " <P> By these standards , last week 's concert at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum was a typical Schneider enterprise . It was part of yet another series directed by him . The program consisted of chamber works by Haydn , Mozart and Schubert , all played by Schneider and his fellow performers with much warmth , zest and perhaps a shade too much emotionalism ( in Schneider 's view , " Haydn was a romantic composer ; Mozart too-and Bach " ) . The performance was unified , but each player had the freedom to express his own personality . " Homogeneity is the worst thing in music , " Schneider explains . " It is not so good in marriage either . The first five bars sound wonderful , but afterward you are very bored because everything sounds the same . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
