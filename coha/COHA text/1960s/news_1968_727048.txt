txt The nuclear-powered plane is back on the drawing boards . Such a craft was conceived in 1946 at Oak Ridge , Tenn. , seat of the nation 's nuclear research and technology . The Air Force was pressing for such a plane . Over the ensuing 15 years roughly $1 billion was poured into developing a nuclear-powered bomber . Then in 1961 President Kennedy ended the program . He said that a militarily useful nuclear aircraft apparently was not possible in the current stage of technology . His Secretary of Defense , Robert S. McNamara , explained that the weight problem , shielding , and safety made development of a nuclear-propulsion unit impractical for the time being . But a lot has happened in the last few years in research , engineering , and technology . Today 's scientific explosion has put the nuclear plane back in the budget . The aircraft industry came up with Lockheed 's mammoth 750,000-pound C ? 5A , just unveiled at Atlanta . It showed that planes weighing in the neighborhood of a million pounds can be built and flown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear-reactor efficiency , has shown that a nuclear-propulsion unit for aircraft is theoretically possible . The result is that the Air Force , the Atomic Energy Commission , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration today are showing new interest in a nuclear-powered plane . NASA has earmarked $250,000 in its ' 69 budget for work on a nuclear-powered plane . The head of its advanced research and // *A-powered plane makes a comeback // technology office , Dr. Mac Adams , explaining this allotment to Congress , said the United States today must be " alert to the possibility of this type of plane . " What money the Air Force is putting into a nuclear-powered plane is classified , hidden in " research and technology . " But it is understood to be considerable . The Air Force dreams of a nuclear-powered plane for such missions as : a missile platform in the skies , with ability to stay aloft indefinitely ; an air command post ; a reconnaissance aircraft of unlimited distance ; logistics aircraft to move men and equipment anywhere and back without having to refuel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely with that of the Air Force and NASA on matters of improved reactor design and efficiency , shielding substances , and crash protection . If and when nuclear propulsion for aircraft comes into its own , the Air Force even contemplates air frames big enough so a small landing strip can be built on top . Crews and supplies would be ferried to this equivalent of a Navy aircraft carrier . Timetable estimated All of this renewed interest in a nuclear-powered plane should not suggest there will be one in this decade , and probably not even in the ' 70 's . Lockheed 's chief scientist , Dr. Ronald Smelt , does not see a nuclear plane before 1980 , and then only if it is really pushed . Dr. John M. Wild , chief engineer of General Dynamics Convair Division , estimates a nuclear plane for the mid- ' 80 's . As to the cost of developing a nuclear plane , estimates vary widely . No one puts it much below $1 billion . Dr. Smelt of Lockheed puts it at between $1 billion and $2 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considerable . " But considering that nearly $1 billion was put into the project a decade or so ago before it was shelved , it is not thought impossible that at least another billion or two would be necessary . The three major considerations in building a nuclear-propelled plane are size , radiation protection , and crash survivability . Current engineering and technology indicate that all are basically solvable with today 's scientific knowledge . Ample capacity needed The project requires a big plane that can carry a lot of weight . A big plane is necessary because a reactor  --  even with current refinements  --  takes up a lot of room . But it is not the reactor that eats up the tonnage . Rather it is the shielding that has to be provided around the reactor for radiation protection . When the nuclear-plane concept was being developed , plane size , under the technology of that day , was limited to 400,000 to 500,000 pounds . That left very little tonnage , after shielding and plane weight , for payload . Efforts were made to find a satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reactor radiation being allowed as a weight saver was discarded . Not until the advent of the 750,000-pound C-5A have planes in the size and weight category needed for a reactor and shielding been available . There is talk of trying to convert a C-5A into a nuclear aircraft  --  that is , building a nuclear C-5A . Lockheed ' officials are quite aware of that possibility and do not rule it out . But , company officials ' indicate that for optimum results a specialized nuclear-plane design would eventually be necessary . Advantages listed The present theory is that standard engines , such as are used now on the C-5A , would be used with conventional fuel during take-off and landing of a nuclear plane . That means the nuclear reactor aboard would not be started up until the plane was at cruise height .. There are important advantages in such a dual-power system . There would be no radiation threat at take-off and landing if the reactor were not operative . Also it is argued that some weight could be saved if nuclear reactors only had to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power needed for takeoff . However , a dual-power system would have problems . It would require a more complicated engine and storage space aboard for chemical fuel . A basic consideration in any nuclear-powered plane is safety . The possibility of a crash landing or an air collision is sure to be of paramount public concern , when and if a nuclear plane is flown : Research classified Research in this field is highly classified . Officials both in government and in the aircraft industry , however , do admit they are working on special techniques , materials , and designs to keep a reactor from breaking up and spewing out radioactive materials in case of a crash . Difficult as that may seem , there are those in the industry who feel that it will prove possible to contain fission products in the event of a plane crash . A lot more , however , has to be understood about crash dynamics and energy-absorbing techniques . One big advantage to a nuclear plane is that it would practically never run out of fuel . Thus the prospect of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maintenance studied There also would be the problem , infrequent as it might be , of having to remove the reactor from the airframe for maintenance . If adequately shielded , that should not create a danger . The reactor would be treated just as are other nuclear reactors temporarily shut down for maintenance . With a spare reactor on hand , the plane could be put right back into circulation and not have to be grounded for reactor overhaul . The Air Force 's Air Systems Command has employed the Rand Corporation , one of the nation 's foremost " think tanks , " to make a mission-analysis study of a nuclear-powered plane . Its long-range and endurance potential are felt to be cost effective . Technologically today such a plane apparently can be constructed .
