Srong old things sometimes take a long time to IL/die . Old men defy cancer , old houses withstand termites and rot , and old trees keep sending out green shoots from the sockets of branches that have been torn away by the wind . And so it happened that America 's oldest magazine , which traced its origins back to a periodical founded by Ben Franklin in 1728 , fought its way into the 1960s . The Saturday Evening Post had faced extinction more than once , but its deep roots in the national traditions had always brought it the strength to survive . And yet old things do die . By the time this decade opened , powerful business interests , controlling millions of dollars in advertising , had begun to lose faith in a magazine that they now considered old-fashioned , out-of-touch . The aged owners of the Curtis Publishing Company responded with a frantic search for novelty . They abdicated their powers to new executives , and all the Curtis magazinesstarted hiring new editors . But the newcomers turned on each other in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the spring of 1968 , the fall into that abyss was almost inevitable . Despite several years of cost-cutting and retrenchment , Curtis President J. M. Clifford found himself unable to pay the debts to bank creditors . At that point , a virtually unknown thirty-six-year-old entrepreneur named Martin S. Ackerman , president of a photo-processing company called Perfect Film &; Chemical , offered to put up $5 million if he could become the president of Curtis . And so we began the last , desperate year of The Saturday Evening Post . I had joined the Post during one of the first waves of renovation in 1962 , and within three years I had become the managing editor , second in command under the editor , Bill Emerson . It was an admirable vantage point from which to observe the death throes of a grand and historic enterprise . " We 'll get all the money we need . " A t seven o'clock on May 2 , 1968 , 1 found my self hopelessly lost somewhere in the thickly carpeted corridors of the New York Hilton Hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week since his election as the president of the Curtis Publishing Company , but I had already begun receiving a stream of cheering messages from our new chief executive . One read , " Martin S. Ackerman ... cordially invites you to join him for cocktails and buffet supper . . .. " The invitation , which had been sent to every Curtis employee in New York , some four hundred people in all , announced the meeting place as the Hilton 's Trianon Ballroom . And now , having presented myself at the Trianon Ballroom , and having found it full of bankers with badges on their lapels , I was lost . The corridors were full of waiters , delegates , and wandering tourists , but nobody had ever heard of either Martin S. Ackerman or the Curtis Publishing Company . I asked an official-looking person for informkion and was directed to another ballroom , where I found myself at a reunion of Niagara University . I asked another official-looking person and was directed to still another ballroom , and here , finally , I began to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching at their drinks . It was a gigantic place , with a stage at one end , a balcony above , and a buffet table that measured not less than thirty feet across . The table was loaded with the customary treasures of hotel buffets ? roast turkey , potato salad , cold cuts , chicken salad , tole slaw , and so on ? all of this surmounted by a gigantic wreath of the sort that used to be called , when laid on gangsters ' graves , a " floral tribute . " After an hour or so of eating and chattering , we became abruptly aware of irritable static from a microphone at the left side of the stage . There , at a lectern , stood a small , dark figure , fidgeting with the microphone , impatient to speak . " Good evening , " he said as we put down our coffee cups and lapsed into silence . " I am Marty Ackerman . I am thirty-six years old and I am very rich . I hope to make the Curtis Publishing Company rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main elements of the Ackerman creed . The first was a guileless , almost childlike belief in the mesmeric powers of his own self . " I am Marty Ackerman " ? the words were intended not for his benefit but for ours , a trumpet call of leadership in those dark times . The second element was the equally guileless , equally childlike belief in the mesmeric powers of money , the root not of all evil but of all good . To be rich ? that was what everyone wanted , was n't it ? And that was the goal toward which Marty Ackerman would now lead us . He began by reassuring us that he approved of us . " One of the greatest assets of any corporation , " he said , " is its people . You , the employees . " The crowd stirred in pleasure . No previous president of Curtis had ever invited us all to dinner at the Hiltonballroom : no previous president had ever praised us as a corporate asset . But we were truly an asset to the company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good of the company . He had once hired a psychological testing firm to check on what his employees were thinking about , and " it turned out that they were thinking about themselves . " This was not right . " There can not be one good Curtis magazine and one bad Curtis magazine , one successful division and one unsuccessful division . Every Curtis magazine must he good . Every division must be successful . " Obviously , this was only an introduction . As Ackerman began to dismiss the problems confront . ing the company , it became apparent that we were not going to hear only praises and promises . " This company has been without leadership , " he said . " The editors have talent , but they need leadership . The printing division is working hard , but it needs leadership . Now , good intentions are fine , but if I just listened to people 's good intentions , I 'd he very poor instead of very rich . In addition to good intentions , we must have performance . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , then they are n't doing their jobs . And an editor who ca n't write so that people can understand him is n't a good editor . So the people who can do the job will get the job , and they will get rich . People who ca n't do the job will go . And decisions are going to be made . They will be hard , and you may not agree with all of them , but decisions will be made . And on balance , there will be more right decisions than wrong ones . " Life would be difficult , then , but it would not be without a purpose . " I 'm ninety-eight per cent eel ' ? taro that we 'll continue publishing the Post , " Ackerman said ? and for the first time , the threatened employees applauded their new leader . " It may not necessarily be in its present form or size , " he warned , " but it will continue . I met this afternoon with the First National Bank of Boston , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . Now I have promised them that this money wo n't just go down the tube , and they know me well enough to know that when I say it wo n't go down the tube , then it wo n't go down the tube . But I can tell you that money is not going to be a problem , " The applause was moderate ? not grudging , not hostile , just moderate . We had been promised that the Post would continue , and that more money would be available , but the promises had been so interspersed with threats and warnings that the prospect before us seemed rather ambiguous . And then , when we thought the ceremony was over , we heard a new voice at the microphone , and we looked up , and there was G. B. McCombs , a senior vice president in the regime that Ackerman had deposed , now pleading the cause of his new master . " I 've only known Marty Ackerman a few days , " said G. B. , " but I can tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a great ioh , so let 's give him another hand . " There was another round of applause , but still moderate , and then we heard low voices commanding us : " Up ! Up ! " We looked around and saw a number of advertising salesmen . who are responsive to such things , lurching to their feet . Ultimately , with some more urging , about two-thirds of Marty Ackerman 's new employees rose and gave him what he might have considered a standing ovation . One of the striking things about Martin S. On was his total obscurity . Not only the employees but many of the top executives at Curtis knew nothing whatever about him . And wherever we called for more information . we could find almost nobody who had ever heard of him . Ackerman 's passionate love of personal publicity soon changed all that . We had rarely heard any Curtis official stage so many press conferences , grant so many interviews , speak so volubly to the bemused press . The campaign reached its climax on August 23. when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman , a lead article about himself on the front page of the Wall Street Journal . MARTY IN ACTION , said the headline . " Aggressive but Likeable Tycoon Applies Tough Techniques at Curtis .... " In that same story , he also gained one of the supreme rewards for an ambitious young man ? the Journal had interviewed his mother . Mrs. Louis Ackerman , of Rochester , New York , viewed him , as mothers generally do , as a humanitarian . Once , she recalled , a high-school boy had to stand shivering on a bridge all day for the sake of some fraternity hazing , and young Marty had run home to get his mother to make a thermos of cocoa for the victim . Mrs. Ackerman thought it understandable that her son should eventually become an executive in the field of film processing , since he had once had a two-dollar Brownie and " took a lot of pictures and developed them in the cellar . " He also saved his weekly allowance of twenty-five cents . Mrs. Ackerman reported further that her son had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class in high school . The Wall Street Journal delicately inquired whether young Marty might some day become President of the United States , and it delightedly quoted her answer : " I do n't know ? he 's Jewish , you know . " The Ackermans appear to have been a closely knit family , of moderate means . Ackerman went to Rochester 's Ben Franklin High School , a name not without future significance , and he took pride in the fact that he went through the University of Syracuse in only two and a half years . and then won a scholarship to Rutgers , where he emerged with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1956 . As a lawyer , Ackerman soon went to New York , where he worked for a year at Louis Nizer 's firm of Phillips , Nizer , Benjamin , Krim &; Ballon , then at the firm of Rubin &; Rubin , which specialized in corporate acquisitions and securities regulations . In 1961 , he established his own practice , engaging in corporate work for other firms . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1962 , he became a partner in Cooper , Ostrin , DeVarco &; Ackerman , anotherspecialist in corporate mergers and acquisitions , but that same year he decided to go into business for himself . After investigating various possibilities , he selected a small and unhappy company named Per-feet Photo Inc. , a collection of small photo-finishing stores that had never been properly integrated . In fiscal 1962 , it earned only $401.000 on sales of $21.2 million . " When the market soured in ' 62 , " said one of Ackerman 's aides , " the owners wanted out . " Ackerman and some associates bought 300,000 shares , a 21 per cent interest and sufficient for a take-over , at a price of $4. as compared to the market price of $6.38 . Ackerman himself bought 50.000 shares and took charge , cutting costs , combining expenses . ( Ackerman later moved the company to the Long Island suburb of Manhasset , near his own home in Roslyn . ) Ackerman 's labors failed to solve the company 's problems , however , and so he looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United Whelan Corporation . the drugstore chain . Once he had maneuvered into control of United Whelan , he began to apply the Ackerman technique ? basically the same technique by which men like James Ling and Charles Bluhdorn were building the great conglomerates ? a dismantling of the acquired corporation , a reintegration of its profitable parts , and a sale or liquidation of the unprofitable ones , In the case of Whelan , Ackerman sold the company 's discount stores , used the money to buy Hudson National Inc. and Equality Plastics Inc. , and merged all four companies into a new firm named Perfect Film &; Chemical . By the time Ackerman undertook his Curtis adventure , he had turned Perfect Film into an enterprise that grossed $58 million a year . netted a profit of $2.5 million , paid its president a prodigious salary of $200.000 , and ran virtually by itself . Even before he came to Curtis , Ackerman had enjoyed roving far from Long Island to pursue various business opportunities . The most bizarre of these was an enterprise called Cemeteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Ackerman was a major stockholder from 1960 to 1963 . This enabled The Gallagher Report , a gossipy Madison Avenue newsletter , to greet Ackerman with a nickname , " Mortician Marty , " and to predict that his only function at Curtis would be to bury the cadaver of the corporation . On a more cheerful note , Ackerman took a proprietary interest in two bank reorganizations . " I became so intimately involved in those two deals that 1 decided I wanted to own a bank myself , " Ackerman said . He therefore bought two small banks on the West Coast and combined them into the Republic National Bank of California . " This is for my kids , " he said . " It 's an investment for the future . You see , my philosophy is that you should n't be the owner of a bank unless you do n't need anything . " At some point early in 1968 , Marty Ackerman 's insatiable curiosity led him to the Curtis Publishing Company . The reasons for his interest are not wholly clear . Ackerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber of Commerce : " I felt I could make a contribution . " Unsympathetic observers have been more cynical , attributing Ackerman 's maneuvers to a desire for greater prestige and publicity . At one point , Ackerman claimed that he had had a lifelong interest in magazines . " I 've always been a prolific magazine reader right from the time I was in high school , " he said . " I read every magazine I can get my hands on . On Saturday mornings I go out and buy up $15 worth of magazines at retail . I get everything from analyst journals to women 's magazines . You just name it , I read it . " But then , as though this might sound amateurish and ridiculous , Ackerman reverted to the conventional statement of commercial faith : " I went into it because I want to make money . " Whatever his motives , Ackerman began investigating Curtis 's finances . " I got a yellow sheet on the company from Standard &; Poor 's and saw two names on the board . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ackerman knew Gould , an influential member of the Curtis board of directors , from previous deals at Perfect Film . " I called Milt and told him I was interested and that I thought I could be helpful . " Ackerman quoted Gould as saying , " Curtis is too tough for anyone , but I ca n't stop you from going to Clifford if you want to . " Gould later recalled his own reaction in more forceful terms . " Curtis was hopelessly bankrupt , " Could told an interviewer . " I was ready to force liquidation . It would have been a social , commercial and moral disaster . but I was ready to do it .... Then , when Marty said he was willing to take a crack at it , I told him , ' You ca n't handle it . It 's a man-killer . It will destroy you . ' But he wanted to go ahead anyway .... " ACKERMAN SEEKS " POSITIVE PLAN " FOR CURTIS , BUT DENIES HE INTENDS TO FOLD THE POST ? Wall Street Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the first men- lion of Martin Ackerman in the Wall Street Journal and his speech to us al the Hilton Hotel . During those two weeks , he was fiercely busy . On Monday , April 22 , he was named to the presidency and elected to the board , without salary . One of his colleagues , E. Eugene Mason , was also elected to the board . That same day , the board approved the sale of Curtis 's Philadelphia headquarters building for $7.3 million . The next day , April 23 , Ackerman took over the whole 32nd floor executive suite in our New York building . Ackerman also arranged a two-month extension of all overdue bank loans and ended once and for all the rumors surrounding the rise and fall of Curtis common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange . Informed that the Exchange was " considering " a de-listing of Curtis securities , Ackerman coolly announced that " Curtis does not at present meet the assets and earnings requirement for continued listing , and does not expect to meet this requirement in the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to oppose the New York Stock Exchange action . " From then on , Ackerman publicly and repeatedly referred to the common stock as " worthless . " Within that same first week , Ackerman had a private conference with Steve Kelly , the publisher of the Post , and outlined his plan to steer the maga. zine into the black . We would cut the circulation from 6.8 million to no more than three million , perhaps less . We would promote it as a magazine of " class , not mass . " And we would make a profit of $2.8 million a year . On the day after the Hilton dinner , I arrived to find the office in a turmoil . Ackerman 's chief assistant , a short , stocky man named Lavere Lund , had announced that Bill Emerson 's conference room would serve very well as Ackerman 's main office , and so the moving men were carrying in his furniture forthwith . " And there 's this Chinaman , " my secretary said in an unbelieving voice , " who acts like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ready to begin concentrating on the Post , and su he summoned us ? a half-dozen editors and another half-dozen advertising men ? to a private dining room on the third floor of the Brussels , an expensive restaurant in an elegant old house near our offices on Fast 54th Street . At high noon , we arrived in a small band , joking our way up the circular staircase , and found Ackerman waiting all alone . " Hiya , " he said nervously as Emerson introduced us , " hiya . Go on over to the liar there and have a drink . " Viewed from close up , Ackerman was a plump , round-shouldered little man , about five feet six . rather pale , with straight brown hair , and a nervous squint that contorted his face when he smiled . From the bar , we saw him shaking hands with Kelly 's arriving troops ? and then greeting his own men , Lavere Lund and the Chinese . Bob Yung , both of whom were short and stout , like Ackerman himself , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCombs . The bartender had not even finished serving the drinks when we heard Ackerman , already seated at the table , calling out , " Okay , okay , let 's get going . " At his place , he had his own drink , a glass of tomato juice , and as we gathered in our chairs around his table , he reached a fork into the glass , speared a hidden clam , and popped it into his mouth . - Okay , " Ackerman said , gnawing , " the proposition for discussion is an evolutionary Post of three million circulation . Now Kelly and I have just been over talking to Bill Bernbach , who 's a friend of mine , and he likes this idea , and he may even agree to join Curtis as a consultant . But the point is , when we try this idea on Madison Avenue , they like it . And I like it . So are we all set to go ? " " Why do n't you just spell it out a bit more for the men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the deal . Is somebody taking notes ? We get out of the numbers game with Life and Look ? we 're not getting anywhere that way , and it 's losing us money ? and we cut back the Post from six point eight million to three million , and we make it a high-class magazine for a class audience . Not a radical change , but evolutionary . Concentrate on the audience we want to reach ? maybe ninety per cent in Nielsen A and B counties . Now is that something you can sell or is n't it ? " , " With that A and B , it sure is , " one of the salesmen cried . " You bet your life it is , " said another one . But then they began to wonder how they were going to explain this to their advertisers . It all sounded convincing here in the comfort of a New York restaurant , but out there in Cincinnati or Los Angeles , it might sound like just another nervous spasm at Curtis , yet another " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to come and talk to their customers . " You come across real strong , " said Joe Welty , the advertising director . Ackerman , unable to resist the flattery , sat there writing down dates and appointments for himself in Chicago and Detroit on the following week . But what we really wanted to know , and what Ackerman really wanted to tell us , was the future of the Curtis Publishing Company . Somebody had just delivered a letter to him , on a silver plate , and he had hastily glanced through it and stuffed it into his pocket ; now he pulled it out again and drew three boxes on the back of the envelope , redrawing and darkening the boxes with his pencil as he spoke . " What Curtis really is , basically , is three different operations , all mixed up together in one company . One is circulation ? the circulation company ? one is publishing ? the magazines ? and one is manufacturing ? the printing plant and the paper mill . Now what we 're going to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up three ways . " He paused and looked around at us to see whether we had understood him so far . We had understood in theory , but it still seemed unreal to imagine the ancient Curtis Publishing Company , which had always owned its own timber , its own paper , its own printing presses , suddenly torn apart . We noddedsagely. however , as Ackerman puffed his cigar and moved on to the next point . " Now everything is screwed up by the preferred stock , which Cyrus Curtis banded out back in the Twenties , when he was feeling charitable . Nobody even knows who these preferred stockholders are or what they want . But as things stand now , you ca n't make a move , you ca n't even blow your nose , without the approval of the preferred stockholders . But we 're not going to be quite as charitable as Cyrus Curtis . So we divide up the company . Now here , off to one side , I 've got a nice little company that 's making money , Perfect Film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis Circulation Company into that . And then , once we prove that the publishing company can make money on its own , we 'll merge that in too . And that will leave the preferred stockholders owning the printing and paper plants , plus a piece of the other companies . Of course , some of these preferred stockholders may try suing us , but we 've got plenty of lawyers , and they 've got strong backs , so we 'll deal with that when we come to it . " Laughter . Ackerman was making jokes to ingratiate himself with us , but there was nothing indulgent about either the jokes or the laughter . Jacobins are always Puritans , for the emotions that compel men to overturn social conventions also compel them to deny social pleasures . In this elegant restaurant , therefore , we all had only one drink and only one course , because that was what Ackerman ordered . and as we ate , it became clear that Ackerman 's puritanism extended far beyond the dinner table . He talked of corporate economies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices on the 32nd floor must go ; the company plane must go . He wanted everyone at work by nine : he himself arrived at eight . And then , as he talked on , it turned out that he disapproved even of secretaries . In fact , he particularly disapproved of secretaries . What seemed to bother him , though , was not the quantity of secretaries but the fact that the average man tends to prefer pretty secretaries to plain ones . " I mean , these Vassar girls in short skirts look great , " Ackerman pressed on , " but think about trading in four of them for a little old gray-haired lady who knows how to type . You know ? I mean , if you want to gel laid , great , but get laid on your own time . Okay ? I mean , I think the money ought to go on what 's really important , like the quality of the product . " " We need a definition . " V e adjourned from the Brussels to the 32nd V floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dispersed ( except for Kelly ) . The conference room filled with other Curtis editors , and with a number of additional Ackerman adjutants we had never seen before . " Okay , we all here ? " Ackerman said . " Now the reason I got you guys together is to talk about the Post . What can all of you contribute to the Post ? Ideas . Maybe even some of your manuscripts , or pictures . Now I was talking with Bill Bernhach , who 's a friend of mine , and he thought there were two big troubles ? the graphics ? the magazine just does n't look very good ? and the definition . A magazine needs a clear definition . A personality . Now how about it ? Does that make sense ? Who 's going to start the discussion ? You ? " " Well , " said the man on Ackerman 's left , " 1 think the fundamental problem of the Post , of any magazine , is to define its Junction . Why is it here ? What does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who 's that ? " whispered the Chinese , Bob Yung , a round and amiable-looking young man , who had slipped into a chair just behind mine . " Peter Wyden , " I whispered back . " What does he do ? " " Executive editor of the Journal . " " Okay , who 's next ? " Ackerman was saying . " Caskie ? " Caskie Stinnett , the editor of Holiday , offered the opinion that the Post should be " more popular , more like Reader 's Digest , " that it should publish " popular articles in medicine , that kind of thing . " From behind me , Bob Yung now spoke up and said he thought each issue of the Post should be devoted to one subject , " like foreign affairs , or literary criticism , or the theater . " Since this seemed ominously specific , and since I assumed that Yang spoke for Ackerman , I thought I 'd better intervene , and so I said that there really were very few subjects that were worth an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hub Cobb of American Home spoke up to say that magazines should devote more attention to the specific interests of the thoughtful professional or businessman . " Like , when there 's a crisis in Czechoslovakia , " Cobb said , " does this open up new markets for American businessmen ? " Ackerman stepped in with a new question : " Should there be more fiction ? " " A fiction issue ? " Yung added . " No , " Emerson and I said , almost in unison . " Every survey shows , " Emerson added , " that fiction has the lowest readership of anything we publish . " Finally it came the turn " What seemed to of John Mack Carter , the bright-eyed little Kentuckian who had achieved the commercial revival of the Ladies ' Home Journal , and who now offered what he called " an idea that nobody will like . " He proposed that the Post give up on the audience that Madison Avenue was hungering to reach , the college-educated urban and suburban middle class , and turn back to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common folk , the older people , the inhabitants of farms and small towns . It is possible that Ackerman sincerely thought that editors could simply drop their natural competitiveness and help other editors for the greater good of the corporation . It is possible that these editors offered these ideas in good faith as proposals for the improvement of the Post ; it is also possible , however , that they wanted , not without malice . to steer the Post away from the course that their own magazines were following . But it gradually came to me , as this hour of " constructive criticism " droned on . that the truth and quality and sincerity of the various proposals were all equally irrelevant as criteria . What was taking place here , I realized , was not a discussion of the Post but rather an event that might be called , in Maoist terms , a mock trial of the Post 's landlords . As in the China of the early Fifties , the other Curtis editors were playing the role of peasant militants , offering helpful suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve ourselves . We were not specifically accused of anything . On the contrary , we were repeatedly told that the purpose of the meeting was to help us , to help us find what we had done wrong and purify ourselves by promising reform . And within a half-hour or so , Emerson and I passed through every phase of psychological self-protection , from innocent incomprehension to forthright rebuttals to excuses , and finally to the beginnings of a guilty and confessional sense that we had indeed failed our corporation , and that we wanted only a new chance to prove ourselves worthy of its confidence . But it was only a mock trial and it ended in our acquittal , and that seemed somehow to put us in debt to the benevolent Marty Ackerman , obligating us to carry out his wishes , if only we could figure out what his wishes were . " I 've got to be able to show evidence of change , and fast , " he said , after dismissing our colleagues . " So how soon can you guys produce this evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed a clearer idea of what the " evolutionary " Post was supposed to he and how the smoothly evolutionary Post was supposed to differ from the unregenerate , nonevolutionary Post we had been publishing until then . Specifically , I asked Ackerman to leaf through a copy of the May 18 issue , the latest one published , and to tell us what he liked and did n't like , what he wanted changed and what he wanted continued . It so happened that the May 18 issue was a good one , marred only by a conventional cover story on teenage shoplifting , the kind of story that editors doggedly keep publishing in an effort to sell more copies on the newsstands . Aside from that , Ackerman liked everything he encountered . But what , then , was the goal of evolution ? The real goal , Ackerman said again , was to provide evidence of change . There must be a sense of direction , of forward movement , an illustration of what the Post would like to become . " Well , if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " then what we 'd like to become is fatter , with full-page Cadillac ads . What makes the magazine look sick is that it 's so thin , and so loaded up with quarter-page ads for dog food and Kitty Litter . " It was agreed , consequently , that the issue then being worked on , the June 15 issue , known in the office as Post #12 , would be immediately followed by an evolutionary variant issue , to be known as Post #12A . This variant issue would not be the usual 80 pages but at least 100 , and it would be printed on heavier and glossier paper , in a run of 20,000 copies for display to skeptical advertisers . It would contain slightly different treatments of the stories in the regular Post #12 , plus ten or twelve pages of special and theoretically " classy " editorial material . It would contain many full-color ads ( which would be published free , after all ) and none of the trashy ads that appeared in our regular issues . " Now , can you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you need a special staff ? " " We can do it ourselves , " I said quickly . " It 'll be a hell of a job , " Emerson elaborated , " but we can do it . " " And Bob will help you , " Ackerman said . We were not exactly overstaffed , and the pros-pert of putting out two magazines instead of one was rather forbidding , but we did at least know the first rule for dealing with pirates attacking a ship : Keep control of the tiller . On the other hand , Bob Yung also knew the first rule for attackers : Get on board the ship . There followed , then , this rapid dialogue : " How about graphics ? " Yung asked . " Do n't you think you have prohlems there ? " " Yes , " Emerson said . " Do you need a new art director ? " " Yes , probably . " " What are you doing about it ? " " Weft , we 're talking to people all over town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not yet , but we 're talking to Wolf and a lot of other people . " " Ah , Henry , " Yung said with a vague smile . " Well , can we all meet first thing Monday morn-ing ? " " Sure ? no , I 'm making a speech to the liquor industry in Washington on Monday morning . " " Okay , Monday afternoon ? " " Well ... " " How about three o'clock ? " " Okay . " Within half an hour of Emerson 's agreement , he received a written memorandum from Yung confirming that an appointment at Lubalin 's studio had been scheduled for 4:00 P.M. on Monday . It was another sign that we were confronting a brisk , newway of doing business . " It 's funny , " Emerson said . " I 'd sort of looked forward to quitting this week , and now Fro surprised at my own optimism . " H Lubalin , whom had never heard of until lthe previous Friday , was actually something of an institution . Once a $5-a-week letterer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had gone on to jobs as varied as teaching architecture students at Cornell and designing the lettering on the men 's rooms of the Ford Foundation Building . Almost inevitably , he had played a part in the creation of the " new " Post of 1961 , although nobody could now say how large that part was . His greatest celebrity in the field of magazine design , however , came from his work on Ralph Ginzburg 's periodicals , Eros , Fact , and Avant-Garde . It was Lubalin , in fact , who did the layout for the celebrated Eros picture story on interracial sex , which played a considerable part in Ginzburg 's being sentenced to prison . An art director who can get his own editor sentenced to prison may be said to have achieved the highest goal to which an art director can aspire . After keeping us waiting for half an hour , Lubalin came bouncing out of some back office ? a short , pudgy man of about fifty , with horn-rimmed glasses and long gray sideburns . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said by way of introduction . Emerson slowly began to tell him that we wanted In make some changes in the Post , to appeal to a smaller and more sophisticated audience . We were going to begin producing some variant issues , Emerson said , and we wanted to know if he would design them . Lubalin , if he did n't know what this was about , seemed remarkably unsurprised . His first question was eminently practical : How much time did he have to design this variant issue ? The answer was : Ten days . Other people began to drift in . First Bob Yung , trailed by a long-legged blonde in a miniskirt , who established herself on a sofa in the corner and began taking notes on everything that was said . Then came Henry Wolf , a dark , frail , shaggy man of about forty-five , perhaps best known as the former art director of Esquire . It was not at all clear what his role was . He said he did n't think any American magazines looked good . " I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and snickered . As for the Post , Lubalin finally announced that it was bland , and he offered the conventional prescription . " You 've got to do things that make people love you or hate you , " lie said . " But let 's not equate the two , " I protested . " You 've got to stir them up , " Lubalin went on . " But if the result is that they hate you , what have you accomplished ? " Lubalin lapsed into silence , brooding . Emerson and Yung made conversation . Then Lubalin suddenly declared that the Post was the wrong size , too big , too thin . He said he thought it should be the size of Vogue . " Yes , yes , much better , " Wolf agreed . And bound with a square backing , like Vogue . " Yes , " Wolf said again . Cont. on p. 100 " And the name , " Lubalin said . " It should be not just the Post but The Saturday Evening Post , like in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Do n't you think ? " And so it became clear that without any specific offer having been made or accepted , and without money having been even mentioned , Herb Lubalin was already at work in redesigning the Post . By the time I returned to the office , I could see that Ackerman had moved in . The dark , cork-lined conference room now had the standard Lexington Avenue executive look . On one wall , where Emerson used to post the editorial schedules listing the contents of the issues he was closing , Bob Yung had tacked up facsimiles of Post covers from the old days , doughboys returning from World War I , Pa and Ma driving the family runabout , children joining in prayer . Against the window at the far end , there stood a large modern desk , heaped high with folders full of papers . Behind the desk , with his feet propped up on top of it , a cigar in his mouth and a telephone at his ear , sat Marty Ackerman . " I want the magazine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a good magazine , but that 's not enough , " Ackerman said . " It must be successful , and to be successful , it must be considered successful . And it ca n't get there on its own right now , because of all the troubles in the past . So the only way it can achieve that aura of success is by being attached to my own personal success , see ? When they write stories about me , those stories will help the Post . " We were sitting in my office , Ackerman and Emerson and I , because Ackerman , in these early days of turmoil , had filled up his own office with negotiators and petitioners , then invaded and temporarily occupied Emerson 's office with another corps of conferees ? and then followed Emerson to the sanctuary of my office . " I 've got to get away from those bankers , " he said . " They can make you dizzy . " " What are you doing in there anyway ? " I asked . " I 'm forcing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys about . " Despite these portents of great events : Emerson wanted to settle some editorial problems , specifically the problem of the editorial page . " Here 's my point on that , " Ackerman said , waving his cigar . " We 've got to have more editorial excitement , all through the Post . Now I happen to be particularly interested in the editorial page , and I think we probably all have something to contribute , so I think each editorial should be signed by whoever wrote it , you or me or Bill or whoever . " " Those would n't be editorials any more , " I said . " They 'd just be columns . Editorials represent the whole magazine . " " I do n't give a s -- - what you call them , " Ackerman said . " But let me just make one thing clear : I 've put my five million dollars on the line . I 've staked my reputation , my career , and my money , on the proposition that I can get Curtis to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment , I 'm going to participate in the editorial direction of these magazines , okay ? Because if I ca n't participate , then I 'm not interested in putting up my five million dollars , okay ? So what I mean is I want the magazine to reflect me . I want it to reflect my personality . " " The only way a magazine can reflect your personality is if you edit it yourself ' I said . There was a pause , and then Ackerman said , " Well , we 've got lots to talk about . " He got up , went through the ritual of tucking in his shirt , then clapped Emerson on the shoulder and returned to business . " I want to tell you , this company is in terrible shape , " he said . " Just terrible . " T hefact that Marty Ackerman reveled in per sonal publicity , the fact that he regarded the Curtis magazines as the newest and brightest toys in his young life , did not mean that The Saturday Evening Post did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors had been working together in the same harness for five years , and a certain weary staleness was predictably evident . And while Ackerman was no editor , there were a number of experienced editors who would have agreed with his statement to an interviewer from the Wall Street Journal : " The Post ca n't make it in its present format . it ca n't compete with television . " By now , therefore , we were already engaged in the production of Post #12A , the " evolutionary " Post . We had begun by scheduling only a few variations on the regular Post #12 , but then Emerson came to me and said , " I finally figured out what this Post # 12A really is . It 's a test of whether I can put out a magazine that they 'll accept . You know what Yung said to me ? He said , ' We want this to he your magazine , not Otto 's magazine or somebody else 's magazine . ' " " Okay , it 's all yours , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is why not do something very jazzy and very special and very pictorial ? Why not do a big picture story of this new musical , Hair ? " " It 's all yours , " I said again . " Yours and Yung 's and Lubalin 's . " And Ackerman 's , It was about noon when Ackerman popped into my office and said he wanted a copy of all the articles scheduled for Post #12A . I promised I would send them to him . " And how about the editorial ? " he asked . " I have n't written it yet , " 1 said . " Okay , I want that too , as soon as it 's written . " The next day , Ackerman called Emerson from Chicago , where he was selling ads for his new , evolutionary Post . " And since this is what I 'm selling , I 've got to believe in what I 'm selling . Right ? " he demanded . " Right , " Emerson agreed . " Now this Marshall Frady story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , True Grit , I like that too . But this little story about the lady racing driver ? that just is n't up to the level of the new magazine that I 'm telling people about , " he said . " Okay , we can live without it , " Emerson said . " Understand ? you can do whatever you want in the regular issues . It 's just the A issue I 'm talking about . And this story about Lady Bird 's tour of Texas ? I mean , it 's all right , but it 's awfully folksy for what we 're trying to do .... " " Okay , no Lady Bird , " Emerson said . " And this story about the moon rocket ? it 's pretty heavy going ? " " Now wait a minute , " Emerson protested . " If you 're going to talk about being urban and sophisticated , then you 'd better give them a few pieces that 'll make them think , and that 's a good solid article . " " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get something else instead of those other two , okay ? And listen , everybody out here thinks our new program is just great . They 're real excited about it . " Back in New York , Ackerman continued to read the copy , and he continued to demand improvements . It was difficult to argue with him , not just because he was the president of the corporation , or because he spoke very forcefully about what he liked and did n't like , but because he was often right . He liked , in every instance , our best stories ; what he disliked was the merely acceptable , the average , the usable material that editors necessarily publish for want of anything better . Perhaps because of his inexperience , Ackerman was pursuing the theory that if he kept demanding something better , something better would be found . From The Gallagher Report . ' May 14 : " ' MORTICIAN MARTY ' ACKERMAN CATCHES EDITORIAL FEVER . Major blunder . Curtis Publishing 's problems financial , management , sales ? not editorial . Marty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people it serves , ' write editorials insult to editor Bill Emerson .... " May 21 : " ... Staffs jumpy . SEP editorial floor chaotic . Marty 's men all over place with ' bright ' ideas , no experience .... Marty talks to press about breezier layouts , subtle cartoons , more sophisticated articles .... " From Newsweek , May 20 : " Ackerman . has moved into an office alongside Emerson 's at the Curtis headquarters in New York City . ' The Post should be the class book , ' he says . ' We want quality rather than quantity . ' What happens if the class instead of mass formula does n't work ? Ackerman says he will keep the magazine going . ' As long as 1 am here , ' he promised skeptical advertising men in Chicago last week , ' there will not be a last issue of The Saturday Evening Post . ' " " There has never been a company with problems like this one , " said Bob Yung , laughing . Emerson and Yung and I were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . " You would n't believe the problems we 've been finding . " " We believe them , " Emerson said . " Everywhere you turn , more problems , " Yung said . " The book division ? millions of copies of books sitting in warehouses . You would n't believe it . " " We believe it , " Emerson repeated . " Then why is Marty spending so much of his time on Post editorial , " I asked , " when we 're one of the few Curtis departments that function ? " " He 's getting more and more impressed with the idea of Ben Franklin 's magazine , " Yung said . " When we first went down to Philadelphia to take over the company , everybody told us to get rid of the Post . They all said that was the first move to make . And all we said was that we 'd look it over , and then come to a decision . But now ? " " It hooks everybody , " I said . " The spell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never be a last issue of the Post , " Yung said . " When 1 saw that , I said to him , ' Marty , that 's quite a commitment . ' And he just smiled . And I said , ' Whatever became of Marty Ackerman , King of the Conglomerates ? ' And he just smiled . " It came time , finally , for Ackerman to produce his own editorial statement at the beginning of Post #12A . We had agreed that this would be the editorial page , and that , as a special ease , it could carry Ackerman 's portrait and byline and signature . We assigned one of our senior editors , Tom Congdon , to ghost-write the statement , and Congdon set to work with great ardor . In midafternoon , I looked in on him . The first few paragraphs had already been composed , in the manner of something destined for marble : " On a fair June day exactly half my lifetime ago I graduated from high school ? not just any high school but Benjamin Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer of the company that publishes Franklin 's magazine . That heritage alone compels dedication , demands that I pledge to you , its millions of mid-20th-century readers , that the fundamental resolve of this management is to perpetuate The Saturday Evening Post . . . . " When I left at seven , Congdon had shown the statement to Yung , and Yung had praised it and taken it to Ackerman , and Ackerman had praised it too , and now they had given Congdon a management statement to Curtis stock-holders , to be " edited . " From this point on , a strange power struggle began to develop . The very next day , at the regular Thursday morning meeting of the editorial staff , Bob Yung appeared with several of the layouts for Post #12A , notably the picture story by Clive Barnes and Pete Turner on Hair . Emerson and I had seen these layouts before , and so we showed no particular approbation , but many of the other edi. tors seemed to experience a sudden flowering of enthusiasm , not just because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dramatic use of pictures , but because they saw for the first time something more concrete than speeches and prophecies : a genuinely new look to their battered magazine . One of the young female editors burst out with the exclamation : " I love it ! " Bob Yung now assumed the role of triumphant impresario . He accepted the editors ' praises for Lubalin 's new look as his own just clue . And this was typical of the enigma of Bob Yung . He had come in with Ackerman , he hovered at Ackerman 's heels , he seemed to carry Ackerman 's seal of office , and this naturally gave him a proconsular power . From the little cubicle he had appropriated , he wandered in and out of editors ' offices , asking questions and inviting gossip ? but never making it quite clear what he actually did or what his responsibilities really were . ( Part of the mystery about him was that despite his fluent , unaccented , and slightly high-pitched English , he was unmistakably Oriental . Perhaps inevitably , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proposing secret nicknames for him . " Blooper boy " was Emerson 's first choice , in honor of Yung 's round and vaguely Sybaritic figure , but all the rest of the nicknames were purely racial ? Fu Manchu , Charlie Chan , Dr. No , Oddjob , and finally the one that lasted , The Yellow Peril , or The Peril for short . ) On this Thursday in May , in any case , Bob Yung acted as though he had become our editorial director , and the staff responded as deferentially as any new editorial director could wish . They asked respectful questions about Ackerman 's plans for the magazine , about the shortcomings of the printing plant , about the need for better promotion . Yung answered all their questions with a mixture of authority and benevolence , and then , when there seemed to be no more questions , he said he had an appointment and departed . He left behind him an editorial staff that now seemed in a state of euphoria about the prospects for salvation , and I thought it best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was likely to change , that the " A " issues might look nice but were not genuine magazines , if only for the reason that they were economically impossible to publish . At that , there began a general outcry against my pessimism , and a general insistence that the evolution heralded by the " A " issues somehow must and would be carried out . " We 're going to have to be with it and go , " Congdon said heatedly . On the next day . I received an unhappy memo from Congdon. indicating that the forces of change and progress were less unified than I had thought . Bob Yung , it turned out , was not always affable after all " I walked into the conference room a little while ago , " the memo said , " and Bob Yung was telling Jeanette Wagner that he had attended a meeting of advertising writers , and that all those guys thought Emerson was no good , a washout . I said nothing . Jeanette said lightly , ' Well , you ca n't be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , they were unanimous . They all felt the same way about him . ' " My first response was to take the memo and hand it to Emerson , and his first response was to vow that he would not work one more day in the same offices with Yung , and that Ackerman would have to choose between them . " I 'm sick of all these (  - -  - midgets ! " he shouted . " I 'm sick of their cigar butts all over the place and the cheese sandwiches sent up for lunch , and I 'm sick of finding them using my goddamn bathroom . And now this ? it 's just one load of s --  too manV . " I was sick of the situation too , not of the cigars and sandwiches , but of the constant confusion about who was supposed to be in charge of what . if Ackerman wanted Yung to run the magazine , then let him say so , and 1 would join in Emerson 's resignation . But Ackerman was away , unreachable , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy , Lavere Lund . After half an hour with Lund , he came into my office , shut the door , and said , " Things are never what they seem . " According to Lund , Bob Yung had never had any authority of any kind over the Post and did not represent Ackerman at all . An hour later , Ackerman himself made a brief reappearance at the office , and Emerson got the same verdict from him . Yung had only been working for Ackerman for two months , he was only an " idea man , " and his only function was " to stimulate people . " At the time , this revelation came as a relief . Yung had been officially stripped of whatever authority he claimed he held , and Emerson had been unequivocally told , " You 're in charge . " Only somewhat later , when I knew Ackerman better , did I realize that this had been an example of what he called " abrasive management . " In other words , he had apparently intended from the start that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight back . If we had failed to do so , we would have been unworthy of our jobs , but once we had reacted as our positions required , then Yung could be sacrificed , or moved on to some other project . Only much later , when the corporation had again begun to founder , did I realize that " abrasive management " is a workable theory only when a corporation has a surplus of managerial talent . I realized this because T realized that Ackerman had brought to the echoing void on the upper levels of Curtis no new management except himself . Bob Yung ended that phase of the power struggle with characteristic style . Late Friday , Emerson was serving as host at a small farewell party for two departing secretaries , and Yung inevitably made himself one of the guests . He wore a double-breasted white suit with a scarlet necktie and a matching scarlet handkerchief protruding from his breast pocket . Having probably been briefed and warned by Ackerman on that day 's unpleasantnesses , he made a point of approaching me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult week , " he said as we shook hands . " From now on , it will be better . " ' E ven though Ackerman was devoting much of his energy to playing editor of the Post , his greatest immediate problem was the reduction of the magazine 's circulation . It was easy to announce that the circulation would be cut in half , but a magazine subscription is a contract , and the reader who subscribes has a legal right to the magazines that have been promised him . Furthermore , the halving of Post circulation threatened every other part of the corporation . The paper plant would henceforth be asked for only half as much paper , and the giant printing presses would stand idle for hours every week . Ideally , however , Ackerman figured that there must be some way of fitting the reduction of the Post together with the expansion of some other magazine . Most publishers , after all , spend lots of money to gain new subscribers , and therefore some magazine should be willing to pay for the Post 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers , it would need more printing presses , bindery machines , circulation workers . Ideally , in other words , Ackerman could find some publisher who would not only enable him to , save money but pay him to save money . There were two obvious choices , Life . and Look , which had both outrun Ben Hibbs 's Post in the suicidal circulation wars of the 1950s ? coming to rest , exhausted , at a level of slightly more than 7 million readers . Look had ended the race slightly ahead of Life , at terrible expense , and had remained ahead ever since , standing now at 7.8 million to Life 's 7.6 million . ( It was an unfair competition , since Life appeared weekly and thus sold roughly twice as many copies as the biweekly Look , but advertising and circulation wars are not waged on a basis of fairness . ) So what could be more natural than for Ackerman , seeking a customer for his unwanted subscribers , to offer Lite a chance to achieve supremacy and to offer Look a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Life could not resist the temptation of a blitzkrieg , and so Ackerman reached toward his first major victory . A dollar a name seemed a minimal price , and that could net him up to $3.8 Haien , with millions of additional dollars erased from the Post 's subscription liabilities . And by getting rid of the rural readers , those listed as living in Nielsen C and D counties , the Post would automatically become more attractive to advertisers . Life , as it turned out , had no intention of buying any C and D circulation , or any name that was already on its own lists , or any subscription of less than a year . Nor , in fact , was it prepared to pay any cash for even our best circulation . What was finally announced , on May 17 , was a deal that benefited both corporations , but within reasonable limits . Lite acquired " a substantial number " of Post subscribers ( apparently one million ) , of whom at least 500,000 were " expected " to switch permanently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 million to Curtis as a prepayment for $3 million worth of printing and $2 million worth of distribution service . As for the future of Curtis , the announcements on this same day disclosed that all of its circulation subsidiaries had been turned over to the Perfect Film &; Chemical Corp . And on the next day , Ack erman publicly acknowledged that Curtis had suffered a " large loss " in the first quarter of 1968 and would lose a lot more during the rest of the year . " We may lose 01 to. ? O nce again there was a meeting . This time , Ackerman wanted to see the entire editorial staff , which sounded ominous , but he went to great lengths to sound reassuring . He seemed to want to explain everything to everybody . He explained the circulation reduction , and he explained the deal with Life . He explained the need for economies , and the need for everyone to come to work early , and the need for editors to think about profits and losses . At times , he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Yale , " he said ? and at times incoherent ? " We 've got to mirror editorial and business decisions together , " he said , " ? uh ? we 've got to marriage them . " On the future of the Post , however , he was full of enthusiasm . " Listen , I can absolutely guarantee you that the Post will make money in 1969 , " he said . " In fact , 1 can guarantee you that the Post will make money even if it does n't make mone.y . What I mean is , if I had been president of this company over the past couple of years , I never would have admitted that the Post lost money . Because ? see ? ? when the Post loses money , it makes the whole company look had . " Then Ackerman told the assembled staff , with an expression of the utmost sincerity , that he had made no efforts to find any new editors , and that he had no intention of making any such efforts . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys , " he said , not once but several times . En route to Grand Central at the end of that day , Congdon told Don McKinney and me that he had spoken with Ackerman both before and after the staff meeting . " And Ackerman said , think we may lose Otto , and maybe Emerson too . ' " " What is that supposed to mean ? " asked McKinney , the chief articles editor . " That they just get misplaced , like old shoes ? " " Did he say this as something to be regretted or something to he wished for ? " I added . " I do n't know , I do n't know , " Congdon said nervously . " I told him that you were a great asset to the magazine , but he just said , ' Well , I do n't think our minds really mesh . ' " " Is that the requirement , for Christ 's sake ? " I asked . " That you have a mind that meshes with his ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " And he said , 1 think Emerson just is n't the kind of editor who can bring off this new Post . ' " " Well , too goddamn bad for old Marty , " I said . We had arrived at Grand Central , and 1 veered off to continue to Penn Station , keeping cool , and thinking : I 'm keeping cool . And then , of course , great waves of paranoia began to sweep over me . If Ackerman felt this way , then Yung must have been acting as his agent after all , and Ackerman had simply denied his own agent when challenged . Or was Congdon playing agent provocateur ? Playing off everyone against everyone else , in the hope that he would emerge at the top ? Or was this all hallucination ? Well , damn . Ackerman , I finally decided , late that night . As long as Emerson and I were at the Post , it was our magazine and not his , and if we had to play the part of the old order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D uring this period of spring maneuvers , Acker- man and I began playing a ridiculous game of who's-got-the-office . Every two or three days , I would come to work and find one of Ackerman 's acolytes sitting at my desk , and every time it happened , I would throw the invader out . I believed strongly that my office , where I had to spend more waking hours than I spent at home , was my territory , a place where I lived . On Ackerman 's side of the ease , it was true that the corridor outside our offices was an inadequate waiting morn for all the people coming to see him , but I could n't believe that his visitors would keep invading my office unless they had been told that it was unused , and I could n't help feeling that these encounters kept occurring because of the hours I kept . I usually read manuscripts until one or two in the morning and arrived at the office at about 10:30 . At my desk , a stranger would look up in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would put my briefcase down in front of him , take off my coat , and scowl . The dialogue was generally much the same : " Oh , is this your office ? " the stranger would say . " Yes , it is , " I would say , as unpleasantly as possible . " They told me it was empty , " the stranger would say . " Well , it is n't . " " Do you mind if I make a few phone calls ? " " Yes , I do mind . " " Oh . Well . where can I wait for Mr. Ackerman ? " " Out in the hall . " Very few people chose to go through this experience twice , but Ackerman 's supply of visitors was limitless , and I had to stage the same scene two or three times a week . This odd contest lasted all summer , until one day when the man I had to evict turned out to be Ackerman 's younger brother , Lennie . It was a very unpleasant scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mysteriously as it had begun . W 1I , Otto , what do you think of that ? " Acker- man came barging into my office , with Yung tagging behind , and holding aloft the first preliminary copy of Post #12A . It was , finally , a magazine in which he had " participated . " It carried his name and his picture and the philosophical statement that Tom Congdon had written for him . It was a good issue because the original Post #12 had been good , dominated by Marshall Frady 's richly ornate portrait of Governor George Wallace and by the Gothic conclusion of Charles Portis 's novel , True Grit . And then , to the regular issue , we had added a profile of J. K. Galbraith by Jack Skow , the picture story on Hair , a humor column by Alan Brien , and a Saroyan memoir , which McKinney had artfully entitled Best IP ishes to a former mistress and Carl Sandburg and a dead Armenian and other people I lost track of . But all that , essentially , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics called stodgy and conventional . The important difference came in layout and design . for Lubalin had provided dramatic changes . The David Levine illustration of George Wallace . for instance , had changed from a black-and-white pen-and ? ink drawing into a red-white-and-blue cartoon that took up virtually all of the opening page . The hippies of Hair gamboled through eight pages of color , and even so relatively staid a figure as Professor Galbraith was illustrated with a full-page photograph of his professorial fist . There was also an important change in the treatment of text : Lubalin had switched to Times Roman type and set everything in a larger size , with more space between the lines , which made a page of solid text look attractively readable rather than dense and forbidding . To the Madison Avenue jaybirds who talk of " visual excitement , " this sample issue was a radical improvement over anything the Post had published in years . And yet much of the visual improvement had little to do with pictures . One reason was that Ackerman had decided to print the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , which would , of course , have added enormously to the printing costs of the regular issues . The second reason was that Ackerman had told the heads of the manufacturing division that he wanted Post #12A to be the most beautiful printing job Curtis had ever done , and that any of the usual ink smears and cracked letters would bring terrible retribution . The third reason was that Ackerman had listened to my warnings about the aesthetic influence of advertisements , and therefore all the little offerings of mail-order shoes and suppositories and courses in hypnotism had been thrown out . In their place , Post # 12A carried 36 full-page color ads ( as compared to 25 in the regular #12 ) . And with a total of 53 advertising pages . and 58 editorial pages , the new issue looked undeniably handsome and opulent , a Potemkin village among magazines . " Well , a lot of it is good , " I said , in answer to Ackerman 's question , " and some things I do n't particularly like . " " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great . It 's just great . This is the kind of magazine we want to put out . " " Great , " said Bob Yung . For the next month or two , we all had a great deal of work to do , and we all tried to cooperate . Post #13A was not very different from Post #13 ? though we added an extra article on Ravi Shankar to soothe Ackerman 's yearning for culture ? but Lubalin once again redesigned everything to make it look more dramatic , and that meant new titles and captions , and another revision of all the copy . And by now , Ackerman was beginning to have lots of ideas about what he wanted in future issues . At one point , in fact , he handed me five pages covered with sixty scribbled ideas for articles : How about future inventory ? I ) Charles Bluhdorn 2 ) Ranking how does the U.S. banking system work ? 3 ) Profile Mike Nichols 4 ) What it 's like to get old 5 ) What to do in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) what the poor do what the middle class do what the rich do 6 ) What 's left of the famous hotels Beverly Hills Hotel ? a week there ? Broadmoor ? in Colorado Springs Grossinger 's 7 ) Howard Raker of Tennessee ? Tennessee politics 8 ) Senator Harris of Oklahoma 9 ) Story on The New Yorker Magazine Some of Ackerman 's ideas ? the working of the banking system ? were unrealistic . Some ? Mike Nichols ? we had already undertaken . Some ? the great hotels ? seemed well worth assigning . It was among the ironies of Ackerman 's regime , as a matter of fact , that one of the articles he had urgently requested , an expert evaluation on how the United States could get out of Vietnam , ultimately turned out to he the lead article by A. J. Langguth in the last issue of the Post . Once the four " A " issues were finished , and the " evolutionary " Post #16 was properly organized and under way , I felt an overwhelming desire to get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so I took my wife on a weeklong drive to Montreal and Quebec . When I came back , I found that all the pressures and conflicts of the past two months had burst like some great blister . Emerson and McKinney had completed the work on Post #16 , and Emerson had written an editorial al tout the Negro ghetto , which so impressed Ackerman that he had it reprinted as a full-page ad in the New York Times . In fact , Emerson reported that Ackerman now seemed to think the whole editorial department had finally proved itself , and that he was consequently turning to other things . Specifically , Ackerman turned to his most immediate cause of financial loss , the payroll . The payroll cost him nearly a million dollars in cash every week , and consequently it was never far from his thoughts . In our first meeting at the Brussels restaurant , he had complained about the number of secretaries , and in his first gathering of the editorial staff , he had remarked that the company could hardly need all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , 1 learned that the axe had struck its first blow . Four hundred of what Ackerman had publicly called " a good . qualified group of people " had just been fired in Philadelphia , and fifty more in New York . None of the victims came from Post editorial ? after all , we had proved ourselves , had n't we ? ? and so we reacted as people usually do in such circumstances , with indifference and even approval . It seemed fine that we finally had a management that would deal with all that waste and inefficiency in Philadelphia . It seemed fine that the payroll could be cut without any of us losing a penny . It seemed fine that somebody else could be sacrificed so that we could continue on our way . i ' ? ost-cutting was essential , but it could never kAmake up for the Post 's decline in advertising income . As recently as 1960 , the magazine had earned more than $100 million a year since then , our corporate upheavals and the increasing doubts on Madison Avenue had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterattack by summoning our weary and dejected salesmen from all over the country to a meeting at Shepheard 's Discotheque in New York . " This magazine will be successful , " he cried into the microphone . " I 'm not just guessing or predicting that . I 'm telling you ! " And from the beginning , Ackerman felt sure that he could sell millions of dollars ' worth of advertising all by himself . He flew from city to city , promising renewal and revival . And then I learned from Emerson that Ackerman had promised some executives in charge of Ford advertising that the Post would put Henry Ford 's picture on the cover of its October 5 issue . I realized that it was too late to talk about ethics , and so I tried to argue in terms of commerce . " General Motors is n't going to like that , " I said . " That 's the first thing I said to Ackerman , " Emerson said . " So we decided to put the heads of all four auto companies on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford people what else might be on the cover . " - But we do have readers , too , and they 're not going to want to buy a magazine with four fat businessmen on the cover . " " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't help that now , " Emerson said . " By now , they 're already selling Ford the whole inside of a gatefold cover . " " Well , think about this as an alternative , " I said . " Why could n't we put the new cars on the cover instead ? That 's what the companies want to sell , and that 's what the readers are interested in . Then maybe we could put the businessmen on the inside of the gatefold . " This was obviously the right solution , so Emerson suggested that we present it to Ackerman . We did , and Ackerman vetoed it . " Look , this is what happened , " he said . " I was out there myself , selling ads for the auto issue ? that 's sometime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top ad guy for Ford said they 'd decided to take all their ads out of that issue . He said the future of the Post was just too uncertain . Well , I told him everything I could think of . but it just did n't have any effect . He kept saying the Post was too uncertain . And this was n't just a couple of pages , this was $400,000 worth of advertising . So I said , You know , I really ca n't understand why you 'd take all your advertising out of this issue when we 're going to have Mr. Ford 's picture on the cover . I mean , Mr. Ford might not like that . ' So he did a sort of double take ? boy , you should have seen that double take ? and he said , ' Well , maybe you 're right . Maybe we 'd better leave the ads in that issue . ' So you see ? I 've got to have Ford himself on that cover . " If we must , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an embarrassing failure on the newsstands , and an even more embarrassing success on Madison Avenue . To anyone connected with advertising , I thought , ai t p.caire of four auto magnates on the cover of an issue filled with auto ads would mean that the cover of the Post was now for sale . In this case , the price had been $400,000 . In future cases , it would be subject to negotiation . As these thoughts occurred to me , I also remembered two previous episodes . " This magazine has got to swing , like other magazines swing , " Ackerman had once said , and he had not meant simply that it should be fashionable but that it should he aware of the way society moved . Ile was speaking of a concept of business in which everything was negotiable , not just value for value but favor for favor . " You know why that story in Time was written that way ? " he asked , referring to a favorable story about his move into Curtis . " Because they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not see anything wrong with editors " bending to the profit , " as he put it . That was simply the way business was done , in publishing as in anything else , and anybody who thought differently was naive . From time to time , Ackerman would disappear for a day or two , and nobody seemed to know his whereabouts more specifically than " somewhere on the Coast " or " out of the country . " Then we would read in the Wall Street Journal that he had bought or sold something , as , on July 15 , we read that he had bought a film-processing company for $11 million in cash . And on the next day , he would dart into my office , firing questions : " What 's up ? What 's going on ? Anything happening ? " " Nothing much , " I said on this occasion . " What 's with you ? I hear you just bought another company . " " Yeah , " he said , grinning . " I have to buy companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fantastic situation . This guy just puts a couple of ads in the papers , and he grosses $16 million a year , without really doing much of anything , and $3 million of that is profit . And here we are busting our asses trying to put out this magazine , and we ca n't make any money on it . I tell you , it 's a commentary on our whole society ! " T he auto issue was still several weeks in the fu- ture . We were working on the September 7 issue , and Ackerman was n't satisfied with the lead . " My theory is , " he said , " that every issue has got to be better than the previous one . " " But listen , Marty , " I said , " that theory has got to come to a breaking point . " " I know , " he said . " There comes a time when a new issue simply ca n't be better than the last one . It 's got to be worse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 've got to make this one better because I 'm fighting for my life . " These were new words , and spoken in a new tone , quite different from the rash enthusiasm that we had heard in his various speeches . " He told me , " Emerson said later that day , " that he wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat about this company . " With the passing of every week , every million-dollar payroll , every money-losing issue of the Curtis magazines , Marty Ackerman was seeing with increasing clarity that he had acquired not just a company with some troubles but an insatiable monster . Only four years ago , after all . Curtis had found that it owned a buried mountain of copper and zinc in Ontario , which it had sold for $24 million , and the monster had already swallowed all of that . Now it stood ready to devour Marty Ackerman and his chauffeured Cadillac and his house in Roslyn and his little film company and the bank he had bought for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arrival , his investment of new capital , his talk of editorial " evolution , " would all help to bring back the advertisers , and that he could ride forth and sell the advertising himself , By July , however , he began to realize that the audience on Madison Avenue enjoyed and applauded his antics but had no intention of supporting the Post . Two months had been spent on the " A " issues , and now another two months had passed , and there still were n't many ads , and the accountants informed him that the cost of the " A " issues and the extra editorial pages since then had amounted to about a million dollars . " And then he had lunch with some old friend in the ad business , " Emerson said . " I do n't know who it was , but somebody he trusted . And this guy told Marty that nobody on Madison Avenue really gave much of a goddamn about him or his new Post or his press conferences or any of the rest of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happy with his book of press clippings that he could n't believe everybody did n't love him . So what he says now is : We 're going to wait just a couple more weeks to see whether Steverino Kelly can hack it . And if that does n't work , we 'll have to consider the disaster plan . ' " Ackerman 's disaster plan for the coming year , as Emerson defined it on this first occasion , consisted of cutting the Post to a skeleton staff , " just McKinney and Ewald and a handful of others putting out a semblance of a magazine . " The following week , Emerson heard a few more details . Ackerman 's computer had proposed specific figures . " Could you cut the payroll by 50 per cent and the materials by 33 per cent ? " Ackerman asked . Emerson said he could not , and I agreed . But what we said was not strictly true . We could indeed make cuts of this size , but only by making radical changes in the nature of the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Post 's editorial budget almost in half , it would have been very difficult to keep together enough of a staff to produce the kind of magazine that Ackerman said he wanted . " Even Potemkin villages need a certain amount of paint , " I said to Emerson . " Otherwise , the Empress will suddenly say , ' Potemkin , those are the worst ? looking villages I 've ever seen . In fact , they 're practically slums . ' " At the beginning of August , nothing short of war could stop Emerson from taking his family back to Georgia for the month . And so , when Ackerman next wanted to talk about the disaster plan , the only audience he could find was me . The disaster plan , I soon learned , was much more elaborate than anything I had heard from Emerson . It began with ? was rooted in ? a passionate sense of loss . " By now I 've put seven million dollars of my own money into this f -- - company , " Ackerman said , " and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what I said was not going to happen . " It was this sense of personal loss that filled him with such an unreasoning anger against the secretaries whom he passed in the corridor every morning , gossiping , like secretaries everywhere , on the telephone . And in Philadelphia , the bureaucracy had taken the previous month 's blow of the axe and then , hydra ? like , begun to heal itself . " They 've been hiring people hack , secretly , " Ackerman said . " We 've got to make this company more flexible , and that means cutting the fixed costs . But in all the work I 've done so far , I 've only managed to get rid of one hundred people out of the whole five thousand . " This , too , filled him with anger , and a desire to cut harder . " I think I 've got to get rid of the whole corporate superstructure , " he said . " There 's just no room for all those people . And all of those regional sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal , too , or else sell it . " As for the Post , it would simply have to find a new break-even level . Ackerman was already tired of soliciting ads . " I 'm not going to go on sucking around for advertisers , " he said . " Screw that . " Instead , he had decided to start making the readers pay for the magazine ? finally ? by subscriptions at $8 instead of the present $1 ( often discounted to $2 . " I believe in the philosophy of pay as you go , " Ackerman said . " The Post will have to cut down to a level where it can pay its own way . " There was a pause , and then he added dreamily , " You know what the ultimate cut is ? That 's when I go down to Philadelphia myself , and I stand in front of the plant , and whenever anybody comes out , I hand them a paycheck , and I say , ' That 's it . Goodbye . Do n't come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then 1 lock up the building , and I sell it as real estate . " On August 15 , the Wall Street Journal broke the news that the Curtis board was to meet to consider " several offers " for the Ladies ' Home Journal and American Home . The only offer that was publicly identified came from Downe Communications Inc. , proposing a swap of 100,000 shares of its own stock , a market value of about $5.4 million . The story pointedly recalled that Ackerman had " stated as recently as May 15 that ' we 're not selling any of our magazines , ' " and then added that Ackerman " said his decision to sell the magazines was based on a conviction that Curtis should concentrate on publishing magazines for ' class ' rather than ' mass ' audiences . " That same morning , Peter Wyden , executive editor of the Journal , came to work early . " It was n't even eight o'clock yet , maybe 7:55 , " he said later , " and as 1 rounded the corner of Lexington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Curtis building , in his blue shirtsleeves , but Martin S. Ackerman ? He came out to the curb , and he looked up at the sky , and then he went back inside again , and I could n't help thinking , ' He looks just like the owner of a supermarket going outside his store to look at the weather to see if the ladies are going to come and get today 's special in tomatoes . ' " A ckerman had always been high-strung , but now he seemed more nervous than ever . He spoke in short bursts , his head twitched from side to side . " I tell you , Otto , there 's no f -- - money , " he said . " There 's just no f -- - money . " The tone in his voice was unmistakable . Ackerman was exasperated , but underneath that exasperation lay fear . " I 've put five million of my own f -- - money into this f company , and it 's all gone , " he said . " I 've got maybe two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help remembering that Ackerman had told me quite recently that he had already put seven million , rather than five , into Curtis . On the other hand , a week after telling me that he had only two million more to invest , he told me that he had invested another five million . I began to realize that Ackerman 's sense of numbers was not that of an accountant , for whom two and two always make four , but more nearly that of an advanced mathematician , for whom numbers form a language , capable of expressing an emotion or a view of the world . Embittered and frightened , Ackerman turned once again to the hated payroll , and to the plan that would eviscerate the monster . Throughout the company , he said , he would ultimately cut the number of employees from more than five thousand to about eight hundred . " have you given any thought to the problem ? " he asked . " Sure . I 've given it a lot of thought , " I said . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 guess so , but I 've got to talk to Emerson first . " " Talk to Emerson , then , but let 's get going . " Cutting a staff is not really so painful as one might think . One starts by drawing up a list of the people who must be kept , and one persuades one ? self that the others would be better off somewhere else . We started off with the advantage of attrition ? a number of editors had left and never been replaced ? and then we agreed on ten more who had to go . Emerson took only two hours to work his way through the ordeal of telling each victim . At the end of the morning , we told Ackerman that we had cut our payroll by about $200,000 , slightly more than a third of the total , and he said , " Yeah ? We just cut the advertising sales staff by $700,000 . " " Remember the Ponzi racket ? " A side from the final destruction of the Post , the 11 , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his decision to cut the magazine 's circulation in half . In theory , it was a perfectly simple measure ? the subscription lists would he fed into a computer , and the computer would execute the required number of cancellations . It was also a perfectly understandable measure since the advertisers were increasingly unwilling to make up the deficits created by millions of rut-rate subscriptions , it was extravagantly uneconomical to continue them . No magazine . however , had ever before announced that a certain number of subscribers , who had already paid their money in advance , were no longer acceptable and would no longer receive the magazines they had paid for . Perhaps because no such announcement had ever been made before , Ackerman 's decision was greeted with a considerable amount of indignation . It was not just that the subscribers had a legal and moral right to their magazines but that they seemed to believe they had a personal relationship with the Post . They thought that when they subscribed , the editor rejoiced , and when they canceled , he grieved . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer tape . Many of the problems could have been solved if Curtis had been willing simply to send a refund to the unwanted subscribers , but that would have cost millions of dollars that we did n't have . While we knew that our readers had a legal right to their magazines or their money ? several litigious subscribers went to court and eventually won judicial endorsement of that right ? we were determined to do our best to give them neither . Not only could we not afford to continue our ruinous circulation policies but we convinced ourselves that we had every right to change those policies for the salvation of the corporation . The question was how to carry out the change . The only real solution was to find some other publisher who would take over Curtis 's obligations , and Ackerman thought he had won the battle when he found that Life wanted Post subscribers . The trouble was that Life wanted only about a million of them , and only a million of the best . To understand the dimensions of this problem , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As of the June 29 issue , the Post had a total of 6,551,963 subscribers ( plus a newsstand sale of 347,050 ) . A little more than 70 per cent of those 6.5 million subscribers ? about 4.5 million ? lived inthe magic A and B counties . Thus , even if we had planned to limit our new circulation of 3 million entirely to subscribers within A and B counties , we would still have to dispose of not only 2 million subscribers in the C and D counties but at least 1.5 million of the cherished A and B subscribers , These statistics of A and B circulation do not have any intrinsic significance , of course . I have used them simply because this was the standard by which Madison Avenue judged circulation and therefore the standard by which magazine managements judged their own readers . The assumption was that the A and B readers not only lived in the best market areas but were consequently above average in education and income . They were the readers every . body wanted ; C and D readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one . " So on about the first of August , " Ackerman explained at his first meeting with the editorial staff , " we 're going to send a form letter to one million A and B readers , saying , We ca n't send you the Post any more , and unless you notify us within ten days , you 're going to get Life from now on . ' " " What if they do n't want Life ? " somebody asked . Ackerman shrugged . " We 're counting on the fact that a lot of people do n't answer their mail , " he said . As for the C and D readers , who were unworthy of the Post and unwanted by Life , Ackerman laughed and said , " We have n't worked that letter out yet . We 'll give them some kind of magazines , but we do n't know which ones . If anybody has any ideas on what the letter should say , please speak up . " In redeploying our circulation , we declared not that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , canceling subscriptions not because we could n't afford to fill them but because we did n't choose to . " You 've been hearing some good things about The Saturday Evening Post , " Steve Kelly 's people proclaimed in full-page ads in the Times in mid-July . " Here 's the long and short of it . Post reduces circulation from 6.8 to 3 million . Eliminates subscribers not living in A and B markets .... The Post has gotten out of the box-car number business and into station-wagon statistics . " In actual fact , however , we were not simply eliminating C and D readers but selling to Life no less than one million of our very best subscribers from A and B counties . And we were not only selling them to Life but taking ads to denounce them as worthless country bumpkins . The first complaint I heard was from my sister-in-law , a graduate of Wellesley. and a resident of the expensive Long Island suburb of Manhasset . She was indignant both at being cut off and at the tone of the form letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Emerson , he answered that his mother in Atlanta had also been rejected . So had my mother in Cambridge , and Ben Hibbs , and Newsweek , and the William Morris Agency . So had Mrs. William Kerby , wife of the president of Dow-Jones , publisher of the Walt Street Journal ; and the Journal , after some inquiries , published a story under the headline : SORRY , MR . ROCKEFELLER , YOU DO N'T QUITE PASS THE INCOME STANDARD . The Journal had discovered that our victims included Winthrop Rockefeller , Governor of Arkansas . The computer also cut off a subscriber named Martin S. Ackerman . Whether Ackerman was right or wrong in thinking that most people did n't answer the mail , he had apparently decided that there was no reason for Curtis to do any better . The ladies in the subscription fulfillment department , which was not the most efficient department at the best of times , had been cut back for the sake of corporate economy . The departmental computers , which were no better than the clerks who tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from subscribers . As a result . many subscribers who sent back postcards to say they did n't want Life did n't get either Life or the Post . Many others who wrote to complain or ask questions got neither answers nor magazines . The mail simply piled up in Philadelphia . The press seemed unable to understand what was happening . Columnists and reporters all accepted Kelly 's ads at face value and made clumsy attempts to be humorous about the idea of the Post discarding lower-class subscribers . James Wechsler , editorial page editor of the New York Post , wrote a little scenario dramatizing the moment when Mrs. Myrtle Jones learns that her Post subscription has been canceled . Art Buchwald wrote a similar scenario involving a man named Feneker , of Hopscotch , Neb . " No one came right out and said they knew The Saturday Evening Post had canceled his subscription , but the atmosphere in the town changed . The bank refused him a loan for a new wing on his house . He had trouble cashing cheeks in the grocery store .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity . " If we 'd paid Buchwald , he could n't have done better for us , " Ackerman said . " Stories like that are practically ads . They tell everybody that the Post is a class magazine , and that not everybody can get it . That 's great . " In this dismissal of criticism , Ackerman was continuing the traditional Curtis attitude toward the subscribers . " Do you know why we publish the Ladies ' Home Journal ? " Cyrus H. K. Curtis had once said to a group of advertisers . " The editor thinks it is for the benefit of the American woman . That is an illusion , but a proper one for him to have . But I will tell you the publisher 's reason .... To give you people who manufacture things that American women want and buy a chance to tell them about your products . " In contrast to Curtis 's certitude , however , Ackerman was already beginning to realize that there were several different ways of regarding circulation , and that Curtis 's traditional way might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's ruin . " This whole mass-magazine business is exactly the same as the Ponzi game , " Ackerman said . " You remember the Ponzi racket ? Where Ponzi said , Send me a dollar and I 'll send you hack two dollars in a month . ' Remember ? Well , that 's what mass-magazine publishers do . They tell the subscriber , Send me two o dollars now , and I 'll send you five dollars ' worth of magazines in the next year . ' And it just ca n't be done . They 're heading for trouble , every one of them . Just like Ponzi . " The difficulty lay not just in eliminating old $1.95 subscriptions , however , but in selling new ones at a profitable rate of $8 a year . Ackerman called in his mail-order experts from the Perfect Film headquarters , he offered retainers to outside agencies that specialized in subscription selling , he assigned me and other Post editors to write sales spiels , and by autumn he himself was drafting ad copy to attract those desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rebuild circulation , and we had neither . We had only Ackerman 's fierce belief : " There 's got to be some way I can get the message across . You know , the people who 've been reading the Post since I 've been here , what with all the problems in the world , they 're better people than they were six months ago . " . . almost as big as Time Inc . ' I n mid-October , Ackerman moved his headquar-ters out of the Curtis building and into his new " town house , " a five-story stone building on Park Avenue at 38th Street . If it is true that one of the fundamental goals in life is the control of one 's own environment , then the town house doubtless represented to some degree the ideal that Ackerman envisioned for himself . I asked him , the first time saw it , how he had happened to select it , and he answered with another one of his Gatshyan revelations : " I used to come driving in from Manhasset every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was always sitting here empty . It had been empty for ten or fifteen years , 1 do n't know why . So about two years ago , long before I had anything to do with Curtis , I bought it , and I gave my wife the job of doing all the decorating , and so she 's spent the last year and a half getting it all fixed up . " Emerson liked to refer to the town house as " the pickle factory , " conjuring up images of Ackerman and his diminutive assistants laboring over vats of boiling brine , but it was actually an elegant building , reflecting , as it was intended to reflect , the $700,000 that Ackerman had invested in it . The front was narrow , perhaps twenty feet wide , with a stone balcony across the front of the second story . Inside , just beyond a reception foyer , there was a hall with marble floors and red carpeting , leading back to the dining room . There were sounds of banging from this dining room , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hall , a curving stairway , also carpeted in red , led upward past a gigantic portrait of Ackerman , very formal , in a striped necktie , holding a copy of the Wall Street Journal , and staring out into space . It looked like a posthumously commissioned portrait of someone who had died young . " I see you 've had your portrait painted , " I said , not without a certain sarcasm . " Yeah , my employees gave it to me , " Ackerman said . I tried to imagine the scene . What pressures must have been applied to the serfs of the Perfect Film &; Chemical Corporation to extort from them this tribute to their leader . " That 's what they call the cult of the personality , " I said . Ackerman , bounding up the stairs ahead of me , muttered something that I could n't hear . At the head of the stairs . a corridor led forward to the library , where callers were asked to wait . The library was a handsome room , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and windows looking out over Park Avenue . Ackerman 's own office at the other end of the corridor was a dark , funereal sort of place , suitable , one would think , for a retired French diplomat . The walls were entirely paneled in dark oak , and even the fireplace was of brown marble . The three windows overlooking the courtyard held heavy red draperies that cut off most of the light . Ackerman 's desk was of dark wood and leather , ornamented with golden figureheads and leaves and curlicues , in the manner of the Napoleonic era , and on the wall facing the desk hung another oil portrait , this one of Mrs. Ackerman . It was an impressive room in which to receive visitors , who sat in frail Empire chairs around the giant desk , but Ackerman himself seemed somewhat ill at ease in his new splendor . He had littered the place with piles of papers , and whenever the phone rang , he leaped to answer it , as though anxious for contact with the outside world . The Ackerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same man who had bustled in and out of offices on our editorial floor . Now , he received us only by appointment , negotiated through one of his two secretaries , and we appeared not as the managers of our own domain but as emissaries to his castle . And in the act of physical withdrawal from the Curtis building , he inevitably withdrew , to some extent , from his intense , physical involvement in the day-to-day problems of the Post . This was quite understandable , too , for in six months of hard labor his involvement had really accomplished relatively little . He had started with the editors , proclaiming a new , " evolutionary " Post , but the same old editors clung to their same old ways ; he had charged up and down Madison Avenue , selling advertising to anyone who would listen , but the figures on ad revenue kept sinking lower and lower : he had struggled to rebuild the circulation , but he could find no way of changing the traditional system . All in all , the company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his town house began to revert to what he had been before he ever came to Curtis , a financier , a maneuverer of stocks and corporations , an expert at mergers and acquisitions , a banker and millionaire . The Ackerman empire at this point was a curious collection of companies , still largely unintegrated and , to use a clumsy word , unrationalized . At the center , of course , stood the Perfect Film &; Chemical Corporation . Its basic business was processing film , but with the help of its various subsidiaries , it alsosold vitamins , pens , camera flashbulbs , and dress patterns . Then , with its apparently limitless supply of Perfect Film stocks and bonds ( the stocks that Ackerman had bought at $4 rose to a peak of $88.50 that June ) , it had bought a magazine circulation company , two film studios , and a number of publishing enterprises . As a publisher , the empire controlled Curtis , with its four remaining magazines ; Popular Library , a paperback publishing firm ; and Magazine Management , Inc. , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biggest of these three had not really been acquired yet , however . Perfect Film had invested virtually nothing in the Curtis shares that Ackerman repeatedly called " worthless " ? preferring instead to take over Curtis 's bank loans , at a profit to itself , and Curtis 's management . Obviously , the rationalization and reorganization of this conglomerate depended on what could he done with Curtis . But Ackerman did not want to limit himself to magazines , any more than he wanted to limit himself to film-processing . He wanted to move forward into books and movies , and for that , he needed a well-organized company from which to operate . And so we came to a new version of The Plan . " Some guys just worked this out for me , " Ackerman said , his voice alive with anticipation , " and I really think it 's going to work . Now here 's what we do . " He had his yellow pad with him , and he began drawing another one of his organizational charts . First a box at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked N &; P , then a third marked SEP Comp . " Basically , we 're going to turn Curtis into a holding company , and we 're going to divide its holdings into two separate companies . The first is the New York and Pennsylvania Company , which we 've already got anyway as a subsidiary in the paper-making business , so they 're going to get the paper mill and the printing plant , see ? Now the second company is going to he a completely new company , which we 're going to call The Saturday Evening Post Company , and that ought to show people that we 're in business to stay . And this will be the company that publishes the magazines . " Now the next step is that I found ten million dollars . " Ackerman continued , with an oddly twisted smile . " And if you want to know where I found it , I wo n't tell you , because it 's none of your business . " ( It turned out later that the staff cuts had left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So then we give three million to the printing plant , and we put seven million into the bank for the magazines . Now once we have this new company set up , free of all Curtis obligations , and with seven million in cash in the bank , I can go right down to Wall Street and sell it to Harvard and Yale and the other institutions . I can issue five million in convertible securities in The Saturday Evening Post Company , backed up by Perfect Film securities , and these institutional investors will buy them up in no time . So we add their five million to the seven million we 've already got , and we have twelve million dollars in a brand new company , still owned by Curtis , and all set to go . I think it 'll work . I really think it 'll work . " A ckerman 's description of The Plan had been mistaken , however , or else he changed his mind again . in a subsequent meeting with the advertising staff , he said that Curtis would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain the printing plant and paper mill in its own name . And the figures for The Saturday Evening Post Company were all different . Now , as he explained it anew , Curtis would hand over the magazines , which would be valued at $5 million , and it would also provide $5 million in cash . The institutional investors , whom Ackerman repeatedly referred to as " Harvard , Yale , and the Guaranty Trust , " would provide another $10 million , riot just for the operation of the magazines but for the acquisition of other publishing properties by The Saturday Evening Post Company . There would be 400,000 shares of common stock , half for Curtis and half for the investors . Once all this was accomplished , there could be no doubts about the Post 's future , " because we 'll have something that nobody else has , we 'll have fifteen million bucks in the bank . " One of the advertising salesmen dared to suggest that he was still encountering questions about whether Ackerman might not , despite the name of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell my wife , " Ackerman promptly replied . The public announcements soon followed . Ackerman chose , for some reason , to proclaim his plans in Boston , at a lunch given by the Boston Advertising Club . The reorganization would " assure " the future of the Post , he said , adding that it " will become a very profitable magazine . " The Times , for one , was not impressed ; it carried only a few paragraphs from a wire-service . To the staff , Ackerman sent a memo on November 1 , declaring : " The Saturday Evening Post Company has now been established . It is an entirely new company incorporating an old name ? a name which in itself reflects determination to continue this great magazine as a mainstay of our publishing operations .... " Ackerman was president . of course , because he had to he president of everything he touched , but beneath him The Saturday Evening Post Company had no corporate structure except for one Frightened accountant , who had been fired during the first purge at Curtis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finances of the SEP Company . The new company 's only other organ , finally , was a seven-man board of directors , drawn entirely from the Curtis board , but this group 's very existence was generally unknown until Ackerman called its members together in January to settle the fate of the Post . Whatever reality the new company acquired , then , had to evolve from its accumulation of identity papers . All our contracts with writers and agents had to be redrawn . Purchase forms had to be revised and reprinted . Our paychecks began arriving on different paper . headed with the newtitle : Saturday Evening Post Company . But for The Saturday Evening Post Company to achieve a real existence it needed some kind of stock-market listing that would certify its otherwise imaginary figures . " Yeah , I 've already got that figured out , " Ackerman said . " Here 's what we do . There 's a little company called Plume &; Atwood that we 're going to buy , see ? Now Plume &; Atwood has three things . It makes copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theaters up around Boston , and it 's got a listing on the American Stock Exchange . So we sell off the copper business for maybe ten million , which is probably more than we 'll need to buy control of the whole company , and we keep the movie theaters , because they might come in handy later on . And as soon as the Post Company is on its feet , we can merge it with Plume &; Atwood , and that 'll get us the market listing . " One day , I heard from Emerson , in the darkest On that Ackerman planned to buy the hook publishing firm of Simon &; Schuster . " I do n't believe it , " I said . " That 's what he says , though , " Emerson said . " They 're at least as big as we are , and much more prosperous , " I said . " That 's still what he says . And Curtis was a lot bigger than Perfect Film when he took it on . In this business , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Ackerman 's restless mind , he went on sniffing at possible acquisitions throughout the Fall , rarely keeping the prospects to himself . In October , he said he wanted to start a joint venture with some book publisher to develop Post articles into a series of Saturday Evening Post Books . 1 myself spent a considerable amount of time in developing this plan . In November , he talked of buying Ed Downe 's newspaper supplement , Family-Weekly , or . if he could n't get that , some other Sunday supplement . He also wanted to buy a group of movie theaters in New Orleans . That same month , he said he wanted to buy a Southern newspaper chain , which he said would cost " a couple of million " but was making a profit . " Maybe we ought to go into newspapers , " he said . " Who 've we got who knows about newspapers ? " And in December , he said , " What I 'd like to buy is Harcourt , Brace . I think they 're the Tiffany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no coherent plan behind these periodic confidences ? nothing more than Ackerman 's sheer enthusiasm at the sight of all the enterprises that were waiting to be bought . I asked him , nonetheless , what all his acquisitions would add up to , and so he treated me to yet another version of The Plan . This time , the first thing he set down on his yellow legal pad was not Curtis but PFO , which stood for Perfect Film . From there , a pencil line descended vertically and then swooped off to the right , ending in the letters P/ A , which stood for Plume &; Atwood . This he subdivided into $10 million worth of brass and copper works and $3 million worth of theaters , and then he added the figure of $10 million for the customary sale of securities to " Harvard and Yale . " " They love me , " he said happily , " the banks and those people , they think I 'm just great . " Below this , he wrote SEP , representing The Saturday Evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Harvard and Yale . His pencil then began drawing swirls around SEP , ending in an arrow pointed at P/ A , representing a merger in March of 1969 . Then more swirls around the two companies and an arrow that led back to PFO . " The whole thing will be a two hundred million dollar company , almost as big as Time Inc. , " Ackerman said , matter-of-factly . " Maybe one hundred million in publishing , fifty million in films , and fifty million in entertainment services , theaters and so on . " The whole pitch , " he went on , " is what this country will be doing ten years from now . Leisure is the growth field . Entertainment , movies , books . magazines , that 's what 's going to be important . That 's the way I see it . " n December 16 , I got home late and found that kfithe day 's mail included an invitation from the American Jewish Committee to attend a dinner at the Hotel Pierre for the presentation of the AJC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation contained a photograph and description of Ackerman . It said that in his hal f year at Curtis he had " made dramatic changes in the business and editorial approach of the firm that have won widespread recognition ... from the business world . " I looked on the back of the invitation and saw that the dinner was being run by an executive committee loaded with Ackerman 's associates and employees , a representative of Ackerman 's accounting firm , another from his bank . " Black tie , " the invitation said . " No solicitation of funds . " The price was $150 per person or $1,500 for a table of ten . R.S.V.P. Tp until the end , Ackerman acted as though the Post had a great future . He organized a series of dinners at the town house for the contributors to each new issue . He summoned interior decorators to repaint the editorial offices and to paper the corridors with a material that looked like wood paneling . But at the same time , he worried darkly about new figures from his accountants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indefinite future . " We ca n't keep on going this way , " be said . " If I could sec a solution , I could put in more money , but if it 's just more money down the drain , then I have to start thinking about my obligations to my backers . " " Did you realize it was going to be this complicated when you started out last April ? " I asked . " Well , I knew it was n't going to be easy . " " So what are you going to do next ? " " I 'm going to take my wife and children on a ten-day vacation to the Bahamas . " " Is it worth it ? " n the morning of January 6 , 1969 , Emerson kfistopped at my office on his way to the town house and asked whether I had any problems I wanted him to discuss with Ackerman , as he had just returned from his vacation . I offered a few of the standard problems ? overdue raises , a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine to place institutional advertising for the Post at almost no cost . I then settled down to plan sonic future writing assignments . " Have you heard today 's rumor ? " McKinney asked from the doorway . " No , what ? " " They 're supposed to be folding the Post ? today . " " Oh , they 're always folding the Post today , " I said irritably . " And Ackerman has summoned you and Emerson to the town house to get the news . " " Well , Emerson 's down there , but I 'm not . And Emerson did n't think it was anything but routine when he left here . " Emerson did not return until midafternoon , and then I followed him directly into his office , asking , still without any particular anxiety , " Do we have a proldern ? " Ackerman had summoned " the editors and publishers " ? a group now reduced to Emerson , Kelly , and two others . There were new figures from the accounting firm of Touche , Ross , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least $3.7 million in 1969 . " Those are n't new figures , " I said . " Ackerman knew them three weeks ago . " " Well , he says they 're new , and he 's acting as though they were new . " Emerson said . Ackerman had announced to the group that he could not stand such a loss . One million , perhaps , but not four million . Having stated the problem , Ackerman began to suggest solutions . One was to sell Holiday . Another was to fold the Post . " He actually said that ? " I asked , unbelieving . " He sure did , " Emerson said . " Just a few weeks ago , he said he 'd sooner sell his wife . " " Well . maybe he 's thinking about that too . " The final decision would be reached , Ackerman had told them , at a special board meeting on Fri. clay . It seemed strange , after a year of Ackerman 's autocratic leadership , to hear him invoke the board of directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had barely been mentioned since Ackerman 's accession . All that evening , according to Steve Kelly , the Times kept asking him for some statement on the newest rumor . " I kept fencing until about eleven o'clock , " Kelly said later , " and then they called back and said , ' You want to hear what your boss has to say ? ' And I said , ' Yeah . ' And they read it to me . " " And what did you say to that ? " I asked . " I do n't know what I said to that , " Kelly said . The headline on Tuesday morning appeared on , of all places , the society page : END OF SATURDAY EVENING POST TO BE WEIGHED BY ITS EXECUTIVES " Amid reports in publishing circles that The Saturday Evening Post may be discontinued , " the story began , under the familiar byline of Robert E. Bedingfield . " It 's all up in the air , " Bedingfield quoted the voluble Marty Ackerman as saying . " We do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't know whether we can make it . " Under four successive presidencies , no major Curtis official had ever announced anything but gains , improvements , and successes , and still the company had lost more than $60 million . If the president of the corporation now chose to say that the future was uncertain , he was announcing , by analogy , the death of the Post . Kelly was not the only one to react with despair . The entire staff read the story and interpreted it in exactly the same way . The only hope was to reach Ackerman and get him to issue a new statement like those he had been making all year ? the future of the magazine assured , a " very profitable " year ahead . or a restatement of that promise of the pre , vious spring : " As long as I am here , there will not be a last issue of The Saturday Evening Post . " But Ackerman could be reached only at the town house these days , and the secretaries there said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for him to disappear . The only explanation was that he was hiding either from the press or from us , or both . That afternoon , Kent MacDougall of the Wall Street Journal was also trying in vain to find Ackerman , and when I asked him what he had heard , he said , " I 'm sorry to say that I hear it 's all over . " On the next morning , Wednesday . a two-paragraph story in the Wall Street Journal gave us a good indication of where Ackerman had been the previous day . Plume &; Atwood , the story said , " has purchased all the issued and outstanding stock of Gold Star Sales Ltd. , a privately held Montreal sales-incentive company a variation of supermarket green stamps , for $10 million in cash . " The main story that concerned us , however , was the Journal 's evaluation of the Post 's fate , and it was forbidding . " The ailing Saturday Evening Post appears to be near death , " the story began . " Persons familiar with Ackerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Milton Gould , the only member of the seven-man Post hoard who has also been a Curtis director for more than two years , is reported to be among those strongly inclined to fold the magazine .... " " Our presentation was so popular that they 're asking us to restage it , " Steve Kelly said as he entered my office that morning . His words made no sense to me , but Kelly was by now so distraught that he sometimes seemed to be talking to himself . One could only listen politely and hope that one would gradually begin to understand . It soon became clear that Kelly had asked his depleted and demoralized advertising staff to create a " presentation , " showing that the Post was ahead of its comparative position the year before and would undoubtedly sell the one thousand advertising pages required for 1969 . " I stayed up half the night rehearsing it , " Kelly said bitterly , throwing the presentation book on my table . I gathered that Kelly had been preparing himself for a meeting scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had abruptly canceled it , leaving Kelly with nobody to whom to make his presentation . " I realize it 's all academic by now , " Kelly said to me , " but just look at this . " Since I was the only audience he could find , I would have to listen to the presentation . " Look at this , " Kelly repeated , opening the book . The charts had been hastily drawn with Magic Marker , but Kelly pressed relentlessly forward . Ad. vertisements on order on the previous day were 32.9 per cent greater than those on the same day in 1968 . A series of charts showed that advertising is a seasonal business , and the final chart in the series showed that current figures would project a total of 540 pages of advertising for the first six months of 1969 , more than half the 1,000 pages we needed to survive . We flipped on through the plastic pages of the loose-leaf notebook , in a folder of artificial leather with gold lettering , and at the end Kelly noted that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , puzzled . " Now I see , " he said finally . " All the pages have been put into the cover backward . " Shortly after Kelly left , I got another call from Kent MacDougall of the Wall Street Journal , who reported a bizarre announcement by Barney Russet , president of Grove Press , calling a press conference for the following day to " reveal a Grove Press offer for the purchase of The Saturday Evening Post . " By coincidence , the cover story in the current Post was about Rosset , and it was billed as " How to sell ' dirty books ' for fun and profit . " MacDougall wanted to know whether there was any connection , and I told him that there was n't . Then , finally , at about two o'clock , I got a call from Ackerman . " Hey . how 're things going ? " he asked . " Jesus , you 're the one who ought to tell how things are going , " I said . " Well , I do n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , you do n't know ? " I said . " Well , the board is divided into factions , see ? One faction wants to close the Post , and another faction wants to keep going for a while , maybe put in another two-three million . " " And which faction are you in ? " I asked . " I just do n't know , " Ackerman said . " I have n't made up my mind . The trouble is , 1 do n't think the next few months are going to cost just two million but maybe more like five million . " " Quite likely , " I said , thinking , You said your , had plenty of money . " Yeah , " Ackerman said . " Meanwhile , the publicity is killing us , " I said . ) " Yeah , nobody you talk to can ever keep his mouth shut , " Ackerman said . I laughed at the dis- 117 ingenuousness of that complaint . Ackerman wanted to know where Emerson was . I said he was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him if necessary . Ackerman asked that we both come to the town house at four . When Emerson and I arrived there at dusk , we found the front door of the building missing . A kind of plastic sheet flapped over the hole , and behind it the front hall was empty . A sign next to the missing door said : Use basement door . Behind the railing , we found an iron gate , and then we crept down an iron stairway , past some heavy grat-ings that looked like the entrance to a dungeon . " That 's where we 're going to keep ? Bob Yung , " Emerson remarked . At the side of the basement entrance , a doorbell was hanging loose at the end of a wire . The door itself opened easily , and a steel door behind it was also open , and so we wandered through the empty basement until we found a narrow circular stairway that snaked upward to an obscure door next to Ackerman 's office . He looked up from his desk and greeted our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Emerson asked . " Oh-h-h , " he groaned , quite cheerfully , " I do n't know whether my stomach can stand this business . Here , let me take your coats . Reporters on the phone last night , frightening the children . I finally had to disconnect the phone so I could get some sleep . " " It has n't been easy for anybody , " Emerson said . " I might as well say right off that we 're all waiting for some kind of word from you . " " I really do n't know what the word is , " Ackerman said . " I got these new figures from the accountants , and they make it look pretty had . " " Now , Kelly , as you know , has been putting together his own figures to show that ? " " Look , " Ackerman interrupted , " the basic fact is that Kelly ca n't produce the ads . " " Well , he 's got this book Iliat says he can , " Emerson said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , so I promised to bring his collection of figures over here and get you to look at it . " " Oh , I 'll talk to him , I 'm willing to be polite to the guy , " Ackerman said , taking Kelly ' s loose-leaf presentation hook and thumbing through it with . out interest . " But I do n't think it 's going to make much difference . See , Kelly 's figures are all based on these letters of intent . He got his salesmen to go out and get these letters of intent from the advertisers , but they ai n't worth s --  . " The telephone rang just then . and Ackerman snatched it up . " Yes , Milt , " he said into the phone . " Okay , Milt , Yeah .... Well , we 'll see .... Okay .... " " That was Could , " Ackerman said . " He 's the head of the faction in favor of killing the Post . He says the Bok family seems to be kicking up some trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . Well , okay , nobody has any objections if they can find the money to pay for it . " " What 's going to happen at this board meeting ? " Emerson asked . " You never know , " Ackerman said . " I have some votes , and Gould has some votes , and then there 's X --  , if he 's functioning . When he 's functioning he 's fairly intelligent , and you can talk to him persuade him . He 's a real swing vote . So we 'll jus have to see . " " But the main vote is yours , " I said . " You sa you have n't made up your mind , but what are yet going to say at that meeting ? " " What 1 think now is , if nothing changes between now and Friday , I 'm just going to be ahsolutcl3 neutral . " " I do n't see how you can he neutral when you 're running the whole company , " I said . " Well . I 11 tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem and say I do n't know the solution . Let ' : listen to somebody else try to come up with a sok tion for a change . I 'm ready to listen . " " You once said you 'd say the Post was making money even if it was n't making money , " I said , stil trying to draw him into the conflict . " Yeah , but you ca n't do that now , " Ackermar said . " The loss is just too big . I 've always said 1 could lose a million , or even two , but five million ? that 's too much , and you ca n't hide it . So the basic decision to be made is : Can the Post stand another year of struggle ? And the next question is : Is worth it ? I mean , is it worth it ? " " I think the answer to both questions is yes , " I said . Ackerman shrugged . My views were about as valuable to him as Steve Kelly 's charts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " The Post is a national institution . You know that yourself . Ben Franklin High School . " " Yeah , well ? " Ackerman sighed . " You know , 1 had a talk with Jock Whitney when he was losing millions of dollars on the Herald Tribune . And he said ? national institutions ? they 're not that differ-ent ? " A hell rang downstairs , and Ackerman started to his feet . He had asked Marvin Whatmore , the pres ? ident of Cowles Communications , Inc. , to come with his advisers to the town house , and for some mysterious reason he did not want the rulers of Look to meet the two chief editors of the Post . And so we departed down the same back stairway on which we had come , like a pair of Verdian conspirators , while behind us we heard it principe loudly welcoming the enemy delegation from across the waters . Thursday , the next day , was the day on which we gradually gave up our loosening grip on hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosset 's offer on behalf of Grove Press , and Rosset 's press conference confirmed our suspicion that his proposal was frivolous . " We would return the editorial direction of The Saturday Evening Post to the spirit of Ben Franklin , adapted to the demands of the modern world in ferment , " Basset declared . Ackerman dismissed Rosset 's gesture as a " gross publicity stunt . " And this was not the only such stunt . One editor got a call from a prosperous rock ' n ' roll production group that wanted to pay $250,000 for the chance to turn the Post into a pop music magazine . Emerson spent much of the day in efforts to find more serious buyers . Fritz Beebe , chairman of the Washington Post Co. , was sufficiently interested to have Ackerman arrange a conference that afternoon with the accountants from Touche , Ross . Who else , then , might want to buy a famous magazine ? Who also had enough financial power to commit several million dollars without the delays involved in consulting some committee ? Emerson tried calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockholder in both Time Inc. and M-G-M . We also called John Diebold , head of the management firm called The Diebold Group . One editor began drawing up lists of possibilities : IBM , Lord Thompson , Hugh Hefner , the Kennedys .... By this time , even the production machinery had begun to break down . It was difficult to keep lashing the editors to work on the February 22 issue , but we did continue shipping manuscripts and layouts to Philadelphia , only to learn that some of them were simply piling up at the printing plant , ignored . The cover , specifically , was being left unfinished in the engraving department while everyone waited for the results of the next day 's board meeting As soon as Emerson heard of the delays , he angrily ordered all work resumed . The Post was not dead yet , he declared , and as long as it still breathed , everybody had a duty to keep working on the next issue . As the day drew to an end , the reactions began coming in . Fritz Beebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Diebold did n't even need to look at the figures to come to the same conclusion . Bronfman said be had enough problems trying to cope with M-G-M . On the other hand , Gil Kaplan , publisher of The Institutional Investor , said he had offered Ackerman 515 million and been told he would need $35 million . Kaplan was puzzled at the rejection and remarked that Ackerman must have already made up his mind to close the Post . Throughout all this , Ackerman 's painters kept doggedly repainting the editorial offices , and by now they had covered Emerson 's walls with a sticky new layer of white . There were various placards on top of chairs and cabinets saying : WET PAINT . Emerson himself was sitting at his desk with a slice of ham , a pickle , and a glass of red wine . It was seven o'clock , and I was going home . " I 've just been on the phone with Hugh Hefner 's money nian , and he sounded pretty interested , " Emerson said . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judge Hofheinz . He 's interested too . " " Why are you eating supper so early ? " I asked . " Supper ! That 's my goddamn lunch , " Emerson said . " I tried like hell . " Television was first . On the CBS eleven o'clock news on January 9 , the broadcaster smiled as he made the announcement : " The Saturday Evening Post is dead . " There was no source , no equivocation , and no fear of denial or retribution . The Friday morning Times was equally definite . " The end will come today for The Saturday Evening Post , " the front-page story by Bedingfield began . " Directors of the once-dominant publication ... will declare it officially dead this morning and arrange for its burial in the subscription lists of Life and other magazines . Thus will end the 147-year publishing history of a magazine that has outlived the more rural , insular America it once served .. .. " The story went on to say that Ackerman had called a press conference in the afternoon , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merging the Post Company with the LIN Broadcasting Corporation of Nashville . LIN owned two TV stations , six radio stations , and interests in several record companies , art galleries , answering services , and mail-order firms . Its most notable possession was the Miss Teen-Age America Pageant . We knew , then , that there was no more work to be done . We were there only to wait until the official announcement came . Emerson arrived Late . almost at noon , and said that he had been on the telephone most of the night with various prospective buyers , and that he had called several hoard members to plead for more time . But none of these efforts seemed to matter any more . The war was over and we had lost . Don Allan , the foreign editor , who had been mandging editor of The Reporter when it was killed just a few months earlier , brought a bunch of orange roses and handed one to each of the girls on the staff . It was a theatrical gesture , but by now we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day of The Saturday Evening Post . " No sooner had I arrived at my office than I looked up to see a small , dark figure hovering in the doorway and taking pictures of me . I scowled at him , but he simply went on taking pictures . " I 'm Steve Schapiro of Life , " he said at last , as though that explained and excused everything . By this time , a number of reporters from the newspapers and newsmagazines were there too , and a young lady named Jill Krementz climbed and crawled around in a miniskirt , taking photographs from various positions on the walls , radiators , and floors . All of these people spent the day sitting around in our offices , watching us pretend to lead normal office lives , and waiting for something poignant to happen . Precisely because they were all flocking around , of course , nothing could possibly happen , and so they eventually went away and wrote that the end had come quietly . The board meeting lasted longer than we expected . It had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it continued until almost two , the huur at which Ackerman had scheduled a press conference at the Overseas Press Club . Six of us had hamburgers and beer around the corner from the office , then piled into a taxi and drove over to West 40th Street , just behind the public library . We arrived at the second floor auditorium in time to see Ackerman standing in the glare of the TV lights and blinking as he read his announcement . " This is one of the saddest days of my life , " he was saying , reading the words calmly in his slightly nasal . voice , " a sad one for me , for our employees . officers , and directors ; indeed , it is sad for the American public . However , no other decision was possible in view of the sizable predicted losses which continued publication would have generated . Quite simply . this is an example of a new management which could not reduce expenses nor generate sales and income fast enough to halt mounting losses .... Having refinanced The Saturday Evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured directors and stockholders of the company that regardless of my own personal feelings , if we could not return a profit we would have to shut down the Post . Apparently there is just not the need for our product in today 's scheme of living . " There were desultory questions . Ackerman guessed that the Post had lost about $5 million dur ? ing 1968 but that Curtis as a whole had broken even . He said he would do his best to find new jobs for all Post employees . And then we all milled around a large table where dozens of cups of black coffee were standing ready , and I kept thinking , simultaneously , two contradictory things : This is not real , it is not happening , and , on the other hand , So this is the way it all ends . I saw Don McKinney take up a cup of coffee and begin sipping it , smiling feebly in all directions , and then I saw Emerson dazedly answering reporters ' questions , and then I saw our slender production chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way a good Italian girl reacts . Tears streamed down her cheeks as she ran out of the auditorium and into the elevator . Back at the office , the television crews were soon established in full force . The glaring lights had been set up in our main corridor , and a crowd was milling around just outside the copy department . Emerson was making some kind of a statement , but the TV people were interviewing anybody they could find . I took Emerson by the arm and led him away from the pursuing interviewers and told him that he ought to gather his staff for a farewell meeting . " What should I tell them ? " he asked . " I do n't know . Tell them whatever comes to mind . Tell them they did a good job . " And so Emerson did gather them all together in his office , barring the press at the door . These were the last survivors , and a woebegone group they were . A dozen editors or so , a few people from the art department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time since I had known him , had very little to say , no jokes , no stories about his uncles in the South . He thanked everyone for the work done , and he apologized for any shortcomings of his own . He said it had been a great voyage , and a great attempt to save a magazine that had deserved better of its owners . And that was all . He asked whether I had anything to add , and I said I did n't . He asked Don McKinney , and he had nothing to say either , but Don Allan , professing to believe that Emerson had called on him , said he did have something to add . " God bless you all , " he said . At about five , the television crews took thei cameras and went away , and people began hringini out bottles of whiskey , and it took very little tim for the liquor to spread a kind of artificial any slightly bitter conviviality . The people began con gregating in Rita Waterman 's darkened productim room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doo of that production room , I noticed that Ackerman ' imitation-wood wallpaper had already started L. tear loose and hang down in tatters . ) Television har played a large part in killing the Post , of course , no malevolently but simply by coming into existence the new medium , more dramatic , more immediate and cheaper . The heirs of Cyrus Curtis and Georg ' Horace Lorimer had been strong when television was weak , and there had been a time when the could have bought control of a whole network , hu they had chosen instead to ignore the new competi tion . And so it took away Curtis 's audience am Curtis 's money , and then it came with lights am cameras to record the death of Curtis 's old maga zine , and nobody really seemed to mind the intru sion . Everyone wanted to take part in the show . As I was about to leave for home , with my las armful of office possessions , I heard Charley Bar sotti , our cartoon editor , shouting , " Otto ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there 's something we ought to say to each other , " Barsotti said , " but I do n't know what it is . " " If you think of it , let me know , " I said . When I passed Rita 's production room , on the way out , they were all sitting in the darkness , watch , ing themselves on television . O nce the Post was dead , we no longer had am li r reason to exist , We came to work the next Mom day to clean up the paperwork , and two of Acker. man 's adjutants promptly asked Emerson how soon all editors could begin leaving . The severance pay . they said , would be half a week 's pay for each year worked . Emerson protested vehemently , but Acker. man 's adjutants said that they had their orders , and Ackerman himself could not be reached . The editorial stall then formed a committee , rejected Ackerman 's terms , and announced to the press that the were prepared to sue for their rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town house for the last time . We found him talking on the telephone to a reporter . " Well , if I had n't come in and taken over last spring , there would n't have been any Saturday Evening Post . " Ackerman said into the telephone . " and there would n't have been any severance pay at all , because there would n't have been any payroll , they were that broke .... " I took off my coat and took a seat next to Ackerman 's desk . I noticed that on a table just to the right of his desk he had put on display the " human relations " plaque presented to him at the dinner the night before . " Well , this is company policy , " Ackerman said into the telephone , " and it was accepted by all the other departments , but the editors apparently think they 're better than anybody else .... " After a few more statements of the same kind , Ackerman hung up and turned to Emerson in a state of great indignation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he snapped , " and if they do , they 've come to the right guy , because I love to play Russian roulette. " " hi case you do n't yet have a copy of this , " Emerson said quietly , " here 's a copy of the employees ' statement to the press . " Ackerman snatched it and glared at it , his hands trembling . ( " ' Considering the devotion , hard work and loyalty of the staff to the magazine through many difficult years ... the attitude of the management strikes me as not only callous but immoral , ' MacLennan Farrell , the Post 's fiction editor , said . The staff has formed an employees ' committee and is seeking two weeks ' pay in lieu of notice .. payment of accrued vacation time , and two weeks ' severance pay for each year of employment .... The committee has retained legal counsel , Taylor , Ferencz , and Simon , and , said one committee spokesman , ' we intend to pursue vigorously all available remedies . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ackerman said , throwing the statement to one side . " It makes me want to throw up . It makes me want to puke ! " " You understand that Otto and I are not taking part in this suit , " Emerson said . " They 're your people , " Ackerman said . " It 's up to you to control them . " " No , it is n't , " Emerson said . " They 're quite capable of acting on their own , and they 're doing it because they feel they 're being treated unfairly . " " And then going to the press before I even hear about it , " Ackerman snarled . " It 's blackmail , that 's all it is ? blackmail ! " He shouted the last word arid banged his fist loudly on the top of his gilded desk . I had thought that Ackerman would feel guilty about his destruction of the Post , and that a sense of failure and loss would make him behave a bit less like a conquistador . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined toward generosity and apologia . I found exactly the opposite . Aided by all those traditional arguments of commerce ? the well-being of the corporation , the need to cut losses and make profits , the interests of the stockholders ? and probably aided even more by the flattery of his entourage , Ackerman had somehow convinced himself that his action had been not just necessary but quite acceptable , even admirable , forceful , brave , and quite beyond criticism . It undoubtedly never occurred to him that within three months he would have to give up the presidency of Curtis . " You talk as though you were some kind of a victim , Marty , " I finally said , " as though you were being persecuted by your employees . " Ackerman nodded in agreement , apparently happy to see that someone had finally understood his position . But you 're the villain of this story , " I said . " Huh ? " Ackerman gasped . He looked as though I had struck him . His eyes widened , and he seemed unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as The Boss , " I said . " The one who wears a big top hat and stands in the window looking out at the workers shouting back at him . You 're the man who killed The Satur. day Evening Post . " " Now listen , I tried like hell to save the Post , " Ackerman protested . " I worked like hell on it . You know that . " " Sure , I believe you , " I said . " But I 'm one of the few people who do . " " And now I gel a statement to the press , " Ackerman said again , bitterly . " That 's blackmail . " " Look , I know your mind is made up , and we 're not really getting anywhere with this argument , " I said . " But I 'd just like to tell you that what we 're urging on you is for your own good . Because if you have any future plans in the field of publishing and communications , and if you care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making things unnecessarily hard for yourself in the future . If you insist on pinching pennies now , you 're going to be sorry you did this five years from now . " There was an element of hypocrisy in my little sermon , of course , and Ackerman answered it in kind . " Well . if it were just a matter of my own self-interest , perhaps I could make some kind of a deal . " he said , " hut this involves money that is n't mine , and it 's a matter of principle . What do for them , I 'll help them get jobs . And anybody with any hardships , we 'll take care of them . " " That 's grand old-fashioned paternalism , " Emerson said . " You sound like a Southern textile mill owner . " " Well . how about this ? " Ackerman finally said . " Suppose I appoint you guys as a committee of two , and I give you 550,000 to settle . the hardship cases , and you can spread it around any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it . I do n't even want to know . I 'll tell the board that it 's for hardships . It 's not severance. flu I you handle it any way you want , " It is a little surprising , after one has given up all hope , to receive $50,000 , but the essence of good bargaining is to accept victory gracefully . " We 'll be happy to take that back to the employees ' committee and see what they say , " Emerson said . " And we 'll get right back to you as soon as they decide . " Suddenly , there was no more argument . It seemed a good offer ? averaging out to an extra week 's pay for each year of employment ? and we rightly assumed that the staff would accept it as a settlement . Ackerman helped Emerson into his coat , and we stood for a moment in embarrassment . " Marty , " I said , holding out my hand , " I 'm sorry it all ended this way . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it always does . " Then , once again , lie undid his trousers and began tucking in his shirt . It was a gesture of preparation , somehow , for all the battles that were to come .
