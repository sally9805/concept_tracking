The Myth of War Profiteering by George E. Berkley Although America 's munition makers are thought to be reaping a financial bonanza from the Vietnam War , the facts indicate otherwise . In 1965 , the top five defense contractors were General Dynamics , Lockheed , Douglas , General Electric and United Aircraft . By the beginning of 1969 , one of the big five , Douglas , had been squeezed out of existence ; a second one , Lockheed , was in trouble . Of the three remaining , two were under severe financial pressure . For many war contractors , Vietnam has been a headache ; for others it has been disaster . Look at the balance sheets . General Dynamics earned $4.48 a share in 1965 , the year the Vietnam build-up got underway . By 1968 , its per share earnings had dropped to $2.83 . Lockheed netted $4.89 a share in 1965 . By 1968 , its per share earnings , computed on the same basis as those of 1965 , came to only $1.64 . General Electric 's profits were running at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to $3.95 , a miniscule gain of 2 cents . United Aircraft scored the only earnings improvement during these war years . Its profits rose from $4.57 to $5.05 , an increase of about ten percent . Even these figures overstate the munition makers ' war " prosperity " for they fail to allow for inflation . If we assess their earnings records in terms of constant , 1965 dollars , we find that United Aircraft marked time during these years , General Electric 's earnings went down by nearly ten percent , General Dynamic 's decreased by almost one-half and Lockheed 's plummeted by more than two-thirds . On January 1 , 1969 , Forbes published a summary of how the top 50o American corporations had fared in earnings growth during the previous five years . How did the prime war contractors place in this comparative ranking ? General Dynamics , the biggest defense supplier , ended up almost at the bottom of the list , placing 481 . The other three held the following rankings on the earnings growth list : Lockheed 390 , General Electric 371 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war buildup , those companies furnishing the sinews of that war were faring a good deal less well financially than most of those firms denied such opportunities . Statistics such as these lead us to ask a further question : Were the blotched earnings record of the big war contractors representative of those war contractors generally ? Did small defense suppliers make out as poorly as their larger colleagues ? Generally speaking , they did . Grumman Aircraft for example , is number 11 on the list of defense suppliers , but since it is smaller than some of the others its government contracts make up over 8o percent of its gross revenues . The company earned $3.03 a share in 1965 , and $2.68 a share in 1968 . AVCO , another corporation that does nearly four-fifths of its business with the Defense Department , listed its earnings as $2.88 a share for the 12-month period ending November 1965 . For the same period ending November , 1968 , the figure was $2.54 . Both these companies experienced better than ten percent declines as measured in inflationary dollars . Measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . Some companies turning out war products fared much better . Raytheon 's earnings more than doubled , leaping from $1.03 in 1965 , to $2.07 in 1968 . McDonnell Aircraft , which took over the financially tottering Douglas in 1967 , managed to log an earnings record of $3.38 in 1968 compared to $2.62 per share three years earlier . Boeing succeeded about as well , as General Electric , its per share earnings inching up from $3.82 to $3.84 during the three-year period . However , these brighter spots are largely explained by special factors . Wall Street analysts attribute Raytheon 's increase to an earnings turnaround brought about by new management , reorganization and a multi-pronged drive into such nondefense activity as textbook publishing and home appliance manufacturing . McDonnell-Douglas ' sudden upsurge in profits in 1968 ? it had run deficits for 1966 and 1967 ? was attributed by a Standard and Poor investment letter to stepped-up deliveries of DC-8 and DC-9 commercial jets . The same investment letter claimed that Boeing 's ability to at least mark time during the war years was based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 707 and 727 . As one combs through investment letters , designed solely to help stock market speculators make decisions on their investments , one finds recurring evidence of the discrepancy between the amount of revenue that companies derive from war contracts and the amount of profit they obtain from such orders . Thus , in reporting on Boeing on March 13 , 1969 , Standard and Poor notes that " over half of billings and the bulk of profits now come from commercial jetliners . " ( Emphasis added . ) In appraising AVCO on September 15 , 1969 , Standard and Poor says ; at one place , that " in 1967-8 about 77 percent of earnings came from commercial operations with the balance from government billings . " Some paragraphs later , we find the sentence , " The Government Products Group accounts for the major portion of revenues . " Similarly , Value Line investment service , in appraising North American Rockwell on July z5 , 1969 , notes that the company 's commercial business was expected to reach 4o percent of its gross revenues in 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same investment letter , Value Line noted that Ling-Temco-Vought had reduced its aerospace business to less than zo percent of its gross revenue . In commenting on this , the service pointed out that the company 's aerospace division had generated after tax profits of less than o.3 percent last year . Common sense tells us that such figures are wrong . After all , who should benefit from a war if not those who furnish its weapons ? And have n't the defense contractors always been hungry for government business . Common sense told the Italians of the sixteenth century that if two unequal weights were dropped to the ground , the heavier would hit the ground first . But Galileo dropped two unequal weights from the top of the Tower of Pisa to prove that common sense was wrong . Early this year , the Logistics Management Institute released a study showing that the average profit margin for all US industry was 8.7 percent of sales , but that the average profit margin on defense work was only 4.2 percent of sales . Since the all-industry average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between defense and nondefense orders may be even greater than the better-than-two-to-one ratio that the figures suggest . The study was attacked in some quarters because it was based on data supplied by the defense contractors themselves . However , for reasons having to do with the stock market , which we will examine shortly , there is more of a tendency for defense manufacturers to overstate rather than understate their profits on war contracts . Furthermore , there are additional data to show that , if anything , defense work is even less remunerative than the LMI study indicates . Once again let us turn to Forbes . Every year it publishes separate listings , ranking the top 50o corporations in terms of revenues , assets , profits , etc . If we extract the rankings of the top ten war contractors in 1968 from the list of revenues , and similarly take their rankings from the list of profits , we obtain a graphic picture of the return on defense work : Now , in examining this list , let 's first exclude American Telephone and Telegraph and General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are among the top ten , their defense business comes to only one or two percent of their gross revenues . In every single instance , the ranking of the remaining eight companies ip terms of total profits earned is far , far below their rank in terms of total gross revenues . Moreover , all these companies have at least some nondefense business and , as already seen , such commercial business earns them much more , proportionally , than do their defense orders . Without their commercial business , the gap between their revenue position and their profit position would widen further . Why are profit margins so poor and why , anomaly of anomalies , do they seem to be even poorer in war time than in peace time ? To answer this we should first note that defense orders were not always the mixed blessing for armaments makers that they are today . During the 195os , many firms flourished on such business . It was the advent of Robert McNamara as Secretary of Defense that made the difference . McNamara changed the Defense Department 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old cost-plus arrangement had allowed the military suppliers to charge the Pentagon whatever the project cost with a guaranteed profit added on . Furthermore , crafty contractors often found ways of including in costs , work that would benefit them in other areas . The fixed fee arrangement did away with blank checks . Contractors now have to stay within the bounds of the predetermined price if they expect to make a profit . Modern munitions-making is a complex business , however , and frequently unforeseen problems lie in wait for even the shrewdest . Lockheed 's heavily publicized troubles with its C-4 Air Force Transport is one of many such instances . Another problem besetting the defense industry is that its outlets for civilian business have grown markedly during the past decade . The economic lethargy of the Eisenhower years is behind us ; the New Economics is established policy . The American economy picked up a startling momentum in the 196os . In addition , various technological breakthroughs have given many aerospace companies considerable nonwar-related business . When the war buildup began in 1965 , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influx of war orders piled on top of civilian billings , forced them into uneconomic practices . These included giving employees extensive overtime work , which means paying them 50 or ioo percent more for work which , because of increasing fatigue , becomes increasingly less satisfactory . Too many orders may also mean hiring less skilled employees , overutilizing plant and machinery and doing other things that can narrow profits and even turn them into losses . It was preCisely such factors which drove Douglas to the wall , transforming its $14.6 million of profits in 1965 into a $27.6 million loss in 1966 . A New York Times financial writer noted in late 1968 that Boeing was beginning to experience a similar situation : " There were signs . that Boeing 's tremendous commercial backlog added to " low return government workl was producing some of the strains that ruined the Douglas Aircraft Corporation ? too rapid a buildup of business , a squeeze on plant and manpower capacity and , in the case of Douglas . . . production problems and deficits . " Boeing in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $1.85 in the first half of 1965 . In constant dollars , this would constitute an earnings drop of over 5o percent . The firm was expected to do less well in the second half of ' 69 . As noted earlier , AVCO 's earnings declined from 1965 to 1968 . In February 1969 , a New York stock brokerage house , Goodbody and Company , issued an investment appraisal of the firm , assessing its prospects if peace should come . Although nearly 8o percent of AVCO 's business comes from the Defense Department , the brokerage house found that peace would actually enhance AVCO 's investment appeal . Its letter noted , for example , that " . . . profit margins on helicopter engine business . . . have been adversely affected by uneconomic production schedules created by the heavy demands of the Vietnam War . With a slowdown in hostilities , which would probably bring a more even flow of production , profit margins should improve . " A final factor must be considered in explaining the wilting profit margins of so many munitions makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-state capitalism that has characterized European economies since World War II , and which began to take hold in the United States during the 196os , has reversed the normal capitalist imbalance . Where at one time capitalism tended to suffer from too much supply in relation to demand , it now tends to enjoy the opposite . I say enjoy because this situation keeps up employment and wages , and encourages growth . However it makes inflation a persistent threat . Thus , war which was once an elixir to capitalism has become17 anathama instead . Lack of military spending has brought many blessings to Japanese capitalism in recent decades . Too much military spending in the United States is reducing 1969 business profits , adjusted for inflation , to a level below that of 1965 . And 1970 will probably be worse . The military suppliers are , if anything , more susceptible than other branches of American industry to these ravages of inflation . Not only , do they find their costs rising , but often they have a harder time passing such costs on to the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-throttle economy is not a boon but a bane , and for a defense contractor , working under a deluge of orders on a fixed fee basis , and requiring a high proportion of scarce skilled labor to meet them , it can prove a disaster . There is yet another problem that plagues munitions makers ? the impact of Wall Street . Stocks do not sell'on profits alone . The auction market , which is the American securities industry , takes into account a variety of factors in determining what price a company 's share will command . In 1969 , the stocks of military suppliers were selling , on an average , at about 8 or 9 times their earnings . The average stock on the New York Stock Exchange , meanwhile , was selling at about 16 times earnings . ( The average price-earnings ratio on the American Stock Exchange was higher still . ) Thus , firms with a high defense component in their production operations have not only tended to make less money but have also been less able to capitalize on such earnings as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company stock compared to those of other companies is not simply a result of the prospective end of the Vietnam war . The gap between what their earnings can command in the financial markets vis-a-vis what other companies can obtain has existed for years . A good price for its stock offers many desirable advantages for a business firm and its managers . First , it increases the managers ' personal wealth . Much has been said in recent years about the separation of ownership from management in American industry but this should not obscure the fact that managers usually own some stock in the firms they run . If Wall Street chose to give armament industries the same price-earnings multiple that it gives other technological companies , the men who run America 's araments would realize a windfall of personal profit . The managers of munitions industries have other reasons for wanting to see their stock priced at the levels of nondefense firms . The higher price increases management prestige and stockholder satisfaction . The latter factor can be quite important . There are many individuals and companies on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled stockholders who might be receptive to an aquisition offer . At the same time , a host of stock brokerage firms and investment counselors are constantly checking out reports , comparing company performances and suggesting ways in which the private investor can best put his money to work . Such elements put increasing pressure on those who run defense industries to appease their stockholders with better prices for their shares . Meanwhile , war contractors are on the lookout themselves for tempting acquisition possibilities . They too have been showing an increasing predilection for taking over other firms and this makes an attractive price for their stock almost mandatory . Most mergers are based on an exchange of securities between the merger and the merged , and the higher the evaluation that Wall Street places on the shares of the former , the better the terms he can offer to the latter . Thus , the heavy discount which defense contractors ' stock sells for these days is putting a severe crimp in their expansion plans , and making them vulnerable to raids by Wall Street predators . This helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understate the profitability of their war contracts . Lockheed , for example , sought to minimize its losses on the C-4 air . cargo plane for the Air Force . One may wonder why business firms want defense contracts at all . Some industries are avoiding them . In January , 1967 , Iron Age , the steel industry magazine , reported that steel makers were refusing to bid on defense work . Despite the fact that the Vietnam War was choking off steel orders in such areas as construction and auto production , the companies were showing little desire to compensate by going after defense contracts . Those industries specifically geared for defense contracting do remain in the armaments-making race and often bid zealously on such work . Despite the flood of defense orders which the Vietnam War has brought them , however , most munitions makers have succeeded in gradually increasing their commercial business . The industrial end of the military-industrial complex is seeking to extricate itself from the dubious and often dismal fortunes of war . Many such firms are finding expanded opportunities in the commercial aircraft sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of McDonnell-Douglas total sales . By the start of 1969 , its commercial orders had increased to 68 percent of the company 's backlog . Today , it is engaged in heavy competition with Lockheed for the coming wave of air bus production . It claims to have signed up 184 customers for its DC-io which will carry about 300 passengers and will gross the company about $14.5 million each . Lockheed claims to have 181 orders for its Tristar air bus , which will sell at the same price , and is counting on a total market of 1400 planes during the 197os . ( Its backlog of orders for theseplanes by the end of last year had a dollar value of z.5 billion , 15 percent more than its entire billing for all work in 1968 . ) Boeing , meanwhile , says it has orders for 183 of its still larger air buses , the 747 , which will be priced at $20 million each . Boeing 's commercial orders had already reached 86 percent of its backlog by the end of last year , as compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the proportion of such backlog orders will undoubtedly cross the 90 percent mark at the end of 1969 . The aerospace industry has assembled the greatest pool of technological manpower in the world , and our ever increasingly technological society is beckoning them into newer civilian fields . United Aircraft 's Sikorsky Division , long associated with helicoptors , has built the experimental turbo trains that now run between Boston and New York . The apparent success of these trains offers the division numerous opportunities to transfer its energies to peacetime uses . Lockheed , in addition to its commercial aircraft business , is moving heavily into underseas technology , computers and medical information retrieval systems . LTV Aerospace is developing and marketing new systems for controlling automobile traffic . The aerospace industry is tooling up for a peacetime world of the 197os that will in all probability earn it much more money than the war years of the late sixties . Some munitions makers are even stepping outside their accustomed areas of competence to strengthen their tie-in with more profitable civilian activity . AVCO has taken over finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community in California . Such endeavors will receive a great boost once the Vietnam War ends and the expected housing boom , long stifled by war-caused high interest rates , gets underway . Raytheon is counting on a post-war housing boom to provide opportunities to sell its new home heating system , as well as to increase orders for its home appliances division . The company 's newly aquired textbook division also stands to benefit considerably from a shift of the country 's resources to nonmilitary purposes . These promising developments will not take most of the munition makers out of munitions-making completely . Despite the low profitability of such work and the existence of more profitable opportunities in the civilian sector , any new contracts that arise for defense work will probably find at least some suppliers ready to bid . As they diversify into the civilian sector , however , they should become a less troublesome element in American society . Improbable though it may seem , many defense suppliers , motivated by sheer greed , may eventually join other industry leaders , Wall Street speculators and such business-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defense spending and a shift to the more lucrative pursuits of peace .
