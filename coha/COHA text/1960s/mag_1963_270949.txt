When the Union Jack was lowered over Jamaica and Trinidad-Tobago last year , the joy that greeted these two new nations was mixed with doubts . Both had a proper , if sometimes unpopular , British upbringing . They both had rapidly growing populations , 15% to 25% unemployment , and a heavy dependence on outside capital . Though their problems remain , Jamaica and Trinidad-Tobago seem to be finding their way with hardly a skip of a calypso beat . <P> Jamaica . Upon getting independence , the 1,600,000 Jamaicans made no headlong rush to erase their British past . Coins and currency still bear Queen Elizabeth 's likeness , and British-trained civil servants , both white and black , retain a firm grip on important ministries . Spry old Sir Alexander Bustamante , 79 , the craggy-faced patriarch of a Premier , preaches patience , order and unswerving friendship with the West . <P> Last year 23 new industries set up shop under Jamaica 's tax incentive program , and both Alcoa and Reynolds Metals Co. have launched multimillion-dollar expansions . Despite a mild recession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious five-year development plan . The government will spend $255 million on housing , schools , roads and land improvement . To increase farm output , Bustamante will slap heavy taxes on idle fields and buy up uncultivated lands to distribute to peasant families at a rate of 10,500 acres per year . <P> Bustamante 's cousin and chief critic , former Premier Norman Manley , 70 , complains that all this is not enough , that the government lacks the " dynamics of independence . " Busta only snorts : " What my cousin means by dynamics is nationalization of business . This government will never get involved in that . " <P> Trinidad-Tobago . In Trinidad-Tobago , two islands just off the coast of South America , Premier Eric Williams , 52 , talks more wildly than Bustamante . Williams is a fiery critic of colonialism , professes to admire British Guiana 's rabble-rousing Cheddi Jagan . <P> But while Williams gets all the political mileage he can out of anticolonialism , he has not led his infant country of 900,000 people into the leftist camp or driven away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinidad could expect no great influx of U.S. or British government aid . But the U.S. came through with a pledge of $30 million over a five-year period for development projects , and has promised to build a road from Port of Spain to the U.S. Chaguaramas Naval Base . So far , despite Trinidad 's own slight recession , industrialization is proceeding faster than in Jamaica . <P> On the main island of Trinidad , Williams ' Industrial Development Corp . recently celebrated the opening of the 100th factory attracted by tax incentives . And last July Texaco demonstrated its confidence in the new nation by moving its Latin American headquarters from Caracas to oil-rich Trinidad .
