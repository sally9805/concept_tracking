The parochial-school system , which for the past 80 years has been the wellspring of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. , is changing its patterns . In Cincinnati , Archbishop Karl J. Alter announced that because of high costs and overcrowded classrooms the parochial schools in his archdiocese would close their first grades next September : 10,000 children in an area that includes Cincinnati , Dayton and Springfield will enroll , instead , in public schools . <P> In suburban Milwaukee , the Rev. Oscar Winninghoff of St. Aloysius ' parish , said that his school would discontinue the first four grades in September 1965 . Having failed to persuade the local public-school board to build a new 24-room school to educate children of his parish in secular subjects , Father Winninghoff said : " I 'm going to quit talking . I 'm saying , ' Here are 600 kids - you solve the problem . And I 'm giving you a year and a half to solve it . ' " Some parochial-school classes have been closed in Green Bay , Wis. , Saginaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. ; in Williamsport , Pa. , the 50-year-old St. Mary 's High School shut down last year , leaving 208 pupils to be absorbed in public schools . <P> Go Out of Business ? Cincinnati 's Archbishop Alter says that three-fourths of all Catholic children in the arch diocese already attend kindergarten in public schools , and " adding one more year to their presence in the public schools will not interfere too seriously with their religious training . " And a new book , by a Catholic mother of five boys who have variously gone to public and Catholic schools , suggests that the church should go out of the school business altogether . Mary Perkins Ryan , author of Are Parochial Schools the Answer ? , argues that providing a general education for all young Catholics has proved an impossible task for the church , that in trying to carry it out the church has neglected to provide " anything like adequate religious formation for all those not in Catholic schools . " <P> <P> According to Mrs. Ryan , the 5,900,000 pupils in Catholic elementary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of all Catholics of school age . The best evidence on how they fare , comparatively , comes from the Rev. Joseph H. Fichter , S.J. , head of the sociology department at Loyola University . Testing social standards , social skills , family relations and school and community relations in typical parochial and public schools in South Bend , Ind. , he found that pupils were nearly identical : both " accept and demonstrate honesty , obedience , gratitude , self-control and kindliness in about the same proportions . " <P> <P> " Supreme Bean . " But by the logic of the Catholic school system , children trained in it should get notably better religious formation . Mrs. Ryan thinks they do not , partly because parochial schools are anachronistic . No longer , she argues , are the Roman Catholic Church and its schools in the " state of siege " that has existed since the Reformation . No longer must Catholics be equipped with weapons of defense against Protestant teachings . What is needed , she feels , is workable religious instruction to make all Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
