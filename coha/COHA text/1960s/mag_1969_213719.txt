From the remote hill country , the bal lots came in by relays of elephants to be counted in regional centers . In the guerrilla-plagued provinces of the north east , troops stood on full alert , and in Bangkok , the capital , some 3,000 uni versity students , describing themselves as " neutral observers , " watched the polls to make sure all was fair and square . <P> Thus , for the first time in eleven years of martial law and rule by a firm if benevolent military oligarchy , last week Thais voted in a general election . The balloting was to choose 219 deputies for the lower house of Thailand 's National Assembly . The election did not change the texture of the government of Premier Thanom Kittikachorn , a field marshal in the Royal Thai Army , nor did it appreciably crimp its powers . But in creating a legal opposition , it heralded a return to more representative and more responsive rule . <P> The regime had taken the first , cautious step toward political liberalization last June with the proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 240 days , but it also safeguarded the Thanom government by stipulating that no-confidence motions could only come from a majority of members of the upper and lower houses . Such a negative vote would be unlikely , to say the least , since the upper house is entirely appointed by the regime . Said Opposition Leader Seni Pramoj , an articulate and outspoken lawyer who was Premier in 1945-46 : " The constitution of 1968 almost achieves immortality for the Thai government . " <P> Coping with Questions . To compete in the lower house elections , Thanom and the regime 's strongman , Interior Minister Praphas Charusathien , who is also Deputy Premier and army commander , constructed their own political organization , the United Thai People 's Party . Seni 's Democrat Party , attractive to urban and educated Thais , formed the main opposition . Also opposing the government were a dozen smaller groups with little nationwide appeal . Despite long years of political apathy and a lack of distinctive platforms , the campaign was fairly spirited . In Bangkok , a Democrat Party stronghold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats , ignoring dire warnings by General Praphas , hammered home their main election theme-corruption in government . <P> The turnout on election day could have been better : of 15 million registered voters , less than half went to the polls . As expected , the government party won a plurality , seating 76 deputies . In addition , Thanom can count on the backing of many of the 71 independents elected , thus assuring him of a working majority in the lower house . Seni 's Democrats elected 57 representatives , including a sweep of all 21 seats in Bangkok and its sister city , Thonburi . The remaining 15 seats went to five of the smaller parties . Although some regime critics dismissed the election as little more than a public-relations exercise , the Thanom government now can claim a mandate of sorts for its actions . But at the same time , it will have to cope with an opposition that can be expected to ask stinging and probing questions . Says Seni : " The Thais are no longer taking things lying down-and I am happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
