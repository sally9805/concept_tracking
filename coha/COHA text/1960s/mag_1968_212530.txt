Much in the manner of Charles de Gaulle listening to Britain 's latest bid for Common Market membership , Congressman Wilbur Mills 's Ways and Means Committee last week heard again the Johnson Administration 's arguments for a 10% income tax surcharge . The answer , predictably , was no . <P> The exercise had a this-is-a-recording tone , but the White House sent in the first economics team anyway : Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler , Budget Director Charles Schultze , Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin and Chairman Gardner Ackley of the Council of Economic Advisers . For two days , the witnesses piled statistic on projection to prove essentially two points : that without the tax increase inflation will grow ever more serious , and that the added revenue is sought not to finance new spending programs but to hold the federal deficit to a manageable figure . <P> Record Quarter . Ackley said that during the last two months of 1967 the economy had spurted ahead all too quickly . The rise in wholesale industrial prices , which was less than 1% in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second half , while the rate of consumer-price increase rose from 2.3% to 3.8% . Figures released later showed the consumer price index up 3.1% for 1967 , the second highest annual increase in ten years . Unavoidable injections of extra dollars into the economy , such as higher federal pay scales and social security benefits , are virtually certain to boost consumer spending this year . Ackley predicted that the increase in the gross national product would set a new record in the current quarter , exceeding the $18.5 billion advance in the last quarter of 1965 . And as domestic inflation worsens , it becomes ever more difficult to reduce the U.S. deficit in international payments and to relieve pressure on the dollar abroad . <P> Schultze sought to show that the budget of $186.1 billion proposed for the fiscal year beginning July 1 ( see box ) was as tight as Lyndon Johnson claimed ; that the $10.4 billion increase over this year results from military needs and extra expenditures required by law . It was here that Democrat Mills , with the full support of Ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psychology . " Let 's get that pencil of yours a little sharper , " Mills told Schultze . " I 'm the attorney for the taxpayer in this case . " The attorney in this case is also the court of last resort for the tax bill . <P> <P> Mills did indicate sympathetic consideration for certain minor parts of the Administration 's revenue requests - an acceleration of corporate tax payments and retention of telephone and automobile levies that were scheduled to decrease April 1-but even with these , the projected budget deficit for fiscal 1969 could be about $18 billion instead of the $8 billion targeted by the White House . After indicating these possible concessions , Mills announced that his committee would turn to other business when it reconvenes next week . He gave no hint whether or when the tax surcharge would be reconsidered . However , if mobilizing of military reserves becomes large-scale , its extra cost and the austerity psychology evoked could well build up pressure on Mills and the House generally to reverse field .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
