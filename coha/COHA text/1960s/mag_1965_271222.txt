" ELECTRONIC technology seems to have abolished time and space . Computers calculate inventories , bank balances and rocket orbits instantaneously , thousands of miles away from their " clients . " Culture is transistorized and education telemetered . Tomorrow or the day after , according to Canada 's Marshall McLuhan , the most provocative scientific prophet around , people will be able to perform their jobs or shop via television from their homes ( if they and their wives can stand it , that is ) . Despite such present or potential miracles , the business of voting in America-the most important business in a democracy-is slow , cumbersome and primitive . Says CBS President Frank Stanton , who has made voting reform a personal crusade : " If we ran our factories , conducted our communications and nurtured our health at the same rate of scientific and technical advance as we conduct our political affairs , we would still be taking weeks to make a pair of shoes , delivering the mail by Pony Express , and treating pneumonia by bloodletting . " <P> <P> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most states have lengthy residence requirements before an otherwis eligible voter can cast his ballot in a national election-Mississippi being the worst , with two years . Many states also require unreasonably early registration ; in Texas , it is necessary to pay a poll tax by Feb. 1 , if one wants to be able to vote in November . Almost everywhere the voter is caught in a vortex of filling in forms and signing registration books . Many of these practices stem from a time when American communities were isolated ; in mobile America , the system is clearly outdated . An estimated 8,000,000 Americans were unable to vote in 1960 because of state residency requirements ; they could have made a crucial difference in that election , which John Kennedy won by a scant 113,000 votes . <P> Even after the citizen has managed to register , voting itself is at best a bother and at worst an ordeal . Polling places are almost always overcrowded , badly organized , requiring long waits . Way back in 1634 , Massachusetts switched from voice voting to paper ballots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so do a majority of the nation 's other 173,000 precincts , despite the fact that electronic progress has already bypassed even the familiar automatic voting machine . <P> A growing number of groups and individuals have become concerned with reforming all this , including a special Commission on Registration and Voting Participation , which filed a report to President Johnson . There is increasing pressure to cut residence requirements out , or at least cut them down . A pioneer in making registration easier is Idaho , which has county canvassers who go from house to house enrolling voters . Result : more than 80% of Idahoans cast ballots in presidential elections , against a scandalous national average of slightly over 60% . <P> Many feel that registration reform is not enough , and that the whole voting process should be overhauled with the help of electronics . Observes the chairman of Chicago 's Board of Elections : " Everyone with the least bit of ingenuity is inventing something to simplify voting . " In several places electronic voting systems have been tried , with remarkable results .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
