On a wet winter night , the neon signs of Crouch Temple glow with a lonely halo in the Los Angeles mist . Central Avenue , not far from the scene of the 1965 Watts riots , is quiet . But inside the temple , a converted theater , the night is alive . Some 2,000 people-black , white and brown-are turned toward the stage , crying " Hallelujah " and " God be praised ! " For more than an hour the tension has been building up . Testimonies , gospel songs , pledges , blessings , and more songs-a writhing , Presleyan , shirt-open gospel rock driven home by an organ , drums and piano combo . Women are swaying in the aisles , men clapping and shouting from their seats . <P> Suddenly , bouncing out of his chair , comes the star . Evangelist A. A. Allen is dressed in a conservative style tonight : the usual iridescent lavender suit has given way to a blue blazer and grey slacks . But the crowd knows him as " God 's Man of Faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming . " We need six strong men to help bring out this stretcher , " he shouts . Half a dozen eager volunteers spring into the wings to bring out an ambulance stretcher carrying a groaning black woman . " This woman was brought into the hospital this morning with third-degree burns over her body , " reads an attending nurse . " She was home , high on dope , when her clothes caught fire in the kitchen . " <P> Please , Jesus . " This is a sad story , " says Allen , in his raspy Ozark baritone . He bends over the victim . " Do you believe God can raise you up ? " Weakly , evincing great pain , she answers . " Yes , I do believe . " " Raise your hands to ward this woman and pray , " he commands the crowd . Four thousand arms shoot into the air . In the back , a little man caresses his Bible . " Please , sweet Jesus . Please , Jesus , " he repeats . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Heal ! " he cries . " Heal her wounds in the name of Jeee-uh-zuss ! " Already , the crowd is murmuring " Thank you , Jesus . " The woman sits up . " Oh , thank God , " she says . The nurse , at Allen 's request , trundles her off to check the wounds in the ladies ' room . She is back quickly . " There is new skin covering where the burns are , " she announces . " It 's a miracle . " <P> For Asa Alonso Allen , 58 , the star of A. A. Allen Revivals , Inc. , that was indeed enough of a miracle to set the tone for a seven-day revival meeting in Los Angeles last week , even though it was not up to his usual standard . His four-color , monthly Miracle Magazine ( circ. 350,000 ) reports even more spectacular cures . In the current issue , a teenager named Yodonna Holley from Globe , Ariz. , testifies that " I received fillings in my teeth " during a camp meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " suggests the story . ) A young man named Charles Embrey , of Hayward , Calif. , testifies that he prayed with Brother Allen and got new spinal disks . Only in the small print can a reader find the careful demurrer : " A. A. Allen Revivals , Inc. assumes no legal responsibility for the veracity of any such report . " Naturally , few of the cures ever undergo the scrutiny of physicians .
