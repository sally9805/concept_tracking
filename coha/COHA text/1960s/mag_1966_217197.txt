( See Cover ) One of the American heroes of the Viet Nam war is not a man but a machine-a snub-nosed , whale-tailed airplane that looks as if it would be lucky to get off the ground . Officially designated the C-130 Hercules , it is known as the " Herky Bird " to thousands of U.S. servicemen in Viet Nam , and it provides them with the sustenance of life . The cargo-carrying Herky Bird works when monsoon rains keep supply ships offshore . It flies ammunition and chow to artillery units isolated by the Viet Cong , now moves 65% of the military air cargo inside road-shy South Viet Nam . Wrote Marine Captain George A. Baker III to his cousin in Georgia : " The Hercules is somewhat our guardian angel . " <P> It is also somewhat of a triumph for the Lockheed Aircraft Corp. , which produces it , and its performance is precisely what the Pentagon has come to expect of the company . For an unprecedented four years in a row , the company has been the Defense Department 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense orders that Lockheed landed in the fiscal year ending last June 30 represented 7.1% of all contracts let by the Pentagon , nearly double the share of its nearest rival , General Dynamics . In the current year , Lockheed is certain to stay at the top of the list of suppliers , having already won two major prizes : a $1.3 billion Air Force contract to build the giant C-5A transport , the world 's largest plane , and a development award likely to grow to another $1 billion for the Army 's so-called Advanced Aerial Fire Support System , a combat plane combining a helicopter 's lift with half the speed of a jet airliner . Aerospace has long since supplanted munitions and ordnance makers as the Pentagon 's principal arsenal of war materiel . In that endeavor , no other company seems able to match Lockheed 's agility and scope . <P> Era of Innovation . Much of the credit for Lockheed 's success belongs to Chairman Courtlandt Sherrington Gross , 61 , who smoothly synchronizes the work of a huge team of expert and highly individualistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiz kids and crusty admirals alike describe Lockheed 's management as brilliant . Lockheed also wins more than its share of the big contracts because of its chairman 's gift for soft salesmanship . That gift was developed during the 29 years that Gross played second fiddle at Lockheed to his older brother , the late Robert E. Gross , a fast-driving , fast-spending , fast-thinking airplane maker who could have been played by Clark Gable . Bob Gross was a giant of his times , but times change fast in aerospace . And in the four years since Courtlandt Gross succeeded his brother as chairman , Lockheed sales have risen by 22% , to $1.75 billion in 1965 , and its profits have almost doubled , to an estimated $52 million .
