Though sometimes divided on other issues , the Supreme Court has been nearly united in its determination to root out racial injustice in the U.S. Last week the court reacted firmly against efforts to evade , either its own pronouncements or laws against discrimination . In the three most important racial cases of the current session , the court : <P> Unanimously required the Montgomery County , Ala. , board of education to assign teachers and other staff members to each of its schools this year in a ratio of at least one black to every five whites . In so ruling , the court supported a quota system for the first time - and may well have opened a Pandora 's box of litigation involving race quotas in such areas as industrial promotions , school admissions and housing rentals . The quota , which was originally ordered by District Judge Frank Johnson , had been pronounced too inflexible a standard by a federal appeals court . But Justice Hugo Black , expressing the opinion of the Supreme Court , declared that it was necessary to " expedite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely unified , unitary , nondiscriminatory school system becomes a reality instead of a hope . " <P> Ruled 7 to 1 that a literacy test required for voting in Gaston County , N.C. , discriminated against blacks because the county had denied them equal educational opportunities . The literacy test , which made ability to read and write segments of the Constitution a qualification for voting , was declared a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1965 . Even if the county today offers a better education to young Negroes , the court decided , this " does nothing for their parents . ' Impartial ' administration of the literacy test today would serve only to-perpetuate inequities . " - <P> Declared that the Lake Nixon Club , a whites-only , 232-acre amusement park near Little Rock , Ark. , had illegally excluded Negroes . By a 7-to-l vote , the court ruled in favor of two Little Rock Negroes-Rosalyn Kyles and Doris Daniel-who had been denied membership at Lake Nixon . The " club , " decided the court , was really a " public accommodation " involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act of 1964 to discriminate against the women . In a lone dissent , Justice Black argued that Lake Nixon was in an isolated spot unlikely to attract any out-of-state travelers . But the majority pointed out that the owners advertised in periodicals that were available at tourist centers . Even though Lake Nixon provided no spectator sports , the court declared , it was a place of public entertainment . Besides , it had leased 15 paddle boats from an Oklahoma firm , its jukebox was made in another state , and the ingredients of three out of four items served at the snack bar come from outside Arkansas .
