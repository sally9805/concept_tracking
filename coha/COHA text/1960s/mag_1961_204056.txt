Faust , Part I ( by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ) , though one of the world 's supreme classics , seldom reaches the New York stage ; Hamburg 's Deutsches Shauspielhaus production , done in German at the City Center , is the first in 32 years . <P> There is reason enough for this : Faust , in one way when done in German , in another in English , poses a language barrier not easily breached. * For non-Germans , again , even the playable but overlong first half creates theatrical problems not easily solved . No one word or phrase-dramatic poem , epic drama-adequately characterizes a work that , teeming with ideas and treading so much ground , can not but be something of a patchwork . <P> Faust contains not just great lyrical speech , but ditties and doggerel , not just shadowy metaphysics but bright worldly wisdom , not just a welter of incident but a web of dreams , not just a prologue about stagefolk but another between the Devil and God . There are archangels along with procuresses , chunky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kind of poem that gave Schubert Gretchen 's spinning song , the kind of dialectic that prefigures Shaw 's " Scene in Hell . " It is among all this that Goethe propels his chief characters , Faust and his tempter-companion Mephistopheles , and that Goethe contrives his only real story , of Faust and the young Gretchen , whose seduction leads to madness and death . The Faustian quest makes for a whole kaleidoscope of moods , a whole panorama of settings . To the English-speaking world , Faust is best known , outside opera , in Marlowe 's fitfully magnificent Dr. Faustus . But as Georg Brandes once noted , where Marlowe 's Faust , loving power , craves omnipotence on earth , Goethe 's , loving wisdom , seeks omniscience . Power inspires sharper drama than knowledge , particularly for those without the German to follow Faust 's speculations and soliloquizings . Goethe 's Mephistopheles , on the other hand , boasts some of the internationalism of Hell . Less fiend than cold-blooded mocker and cynic , he is full of wit and mischief , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one role that can often make action as expressive as words . <P> The 20-scene production , shunning traditional grandiosities , keeps largely to a simple platform stage , at times with no more props than a bench and a tree , and often vivid expressionist lighting . The production suffers , however , from a total lack of style , from seeming solidly , even a little clumpingly , echt Deutsch . It may not seem too German for those who know German ; for those who do not , Faust is more rewarding in Marlowe 's play , or Berlioz ' or Gounod 's or even Boito 's music . But , if not exactly something to see , as a great classic it may yet , perhaps , be something to have seen . <P> * At the City Center , English summaries via transistor radio are a broad but not specific help .
