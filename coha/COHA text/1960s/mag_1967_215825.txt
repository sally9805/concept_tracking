Arlen Specter , 37 , entered Philadelphia 's mayoralty campaign last spring with overwhelming advantages . He was already well known and popular as an able investigator and prosecutor . On the hustings he demonstrated the intelligence , presence and reformist approach that had elected him district attorney in 1965-the first Republican to win a major city wide office in 14 years . Democratic Mayor James Tate , 57 , bore the triple burden of a mediocre record , a ponderous personality and a divided party . But instead of pleading nolo contendere , Tate has doggedly chipped away at Specter 's seemingly unassailable early lead . <P> The challenger 's main thrust has been to accuse Tate 's administration of being " more interested in patronage and favoritism than in moving the city ahead , " of turning the City of Brotherly Love into " Shakedown , U.S.A. " When Specter demands that Tate name his campaign contributors-donors who , says Specter , stand to get official favors from Tate-the mayor demurs , . While Specter makes points with this strategy , Tate 's arsenal contains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major impact . <P> Turn to Fudge . Last summer , Tate imposed a state of limited emergency as a precaution against racial violence and fully backed Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo , who mobilized massive force at the least hint of trouble . Having dominated the front pages all summer , Tate is now able to declaim : " While other cities were being burned , sacked and pillaged , Philadelphia had law and order . " When Tate demands to know if Specter , as mayor , would keep the controversial Rizzo in office , it is the D.A . ' s turn to fudge . To take a stand on Rizzo would alienate either those who considered the commissioner 's tactics repressive or those who found them highly effective . <P> Nor has Specter 's claim of sole possession of reform credentials gone unchallenged . Specter switched parties in 1965 when Democratic leaders refused him the nomination for district attorney or state senator . To win he must attract other defectors , because Philadelphia Democrats enjoy a registration edge over Republicans of 560,000 to 370,000 . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he depicts himself as the true legatee of the progressive Democratic administrations of Joseph Clark and Richardson Dilworth . Specter 's problem here is that Tate does not present a convenient conservative contrast . <P> The mayor generally follows a liberal Democratic line , has organized labor on his side , and asserts that he , not the " fake liberal " Specter , is the " rightful heir of Clark and Dilworth . " Clark , now Pennsylvania 's senior Senator , has campaigned with Tate , and this week Vice President Hubert Humphrey is scheduled to appear on Tate 's behalf .
