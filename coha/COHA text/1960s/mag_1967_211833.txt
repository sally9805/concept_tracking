With its wet surroundings , Key West , Fla. , the southernmost city in the continental U.S. , is ideal for conch shell collecting and deep-sea fishing , but it has been hard up for fresh water . The city long had to rely on a 130-mi . Navy-owned pipeline to the mainland , a source vulnerable to hurricanes , drought and , recently , the Navy 's rising water appetite at its own local bases . <P> Last week , Key West became the first U.S. city to get its entire freshwater supply from the sea when the Florida Keys Aqueduct Commission dedicated the world 's largest single-unit desalting plant , a gleaming $3.3 million facility that can produce up to 2,620,000 gallons a day . The plant uses the so-called " flash " process , by which heated sea water is forced through a series of low-pressure chambers until it vaporizes into steam , which , in turn , condenses into pure water-much as steam condenses on the surface of a tea kettle . Fifteen years ago , desalination cost up to $5 per 1,000 gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Desalting facilities are in operation in places like Kuwait , Curaao and Israel . In the U.S. , with technical assistance from the Interior Department 's Office of Saline Water , Buckeye , Ariz. , and Port Mansfield , Texas , both turned to desalination after their water became too brackish . With the threat of water shortages and pollution mounting , other cities can be expected to follow suit , especially as nuclear power becomes available to make large-scale desalination projects more economical . <P> By 1973 , parts of Los Angeles will start getting converted sea water from a nuclear-powered 150 million-gallon-a-day plant . The U.S. and Mexico may put up a billion-gallon-a-day plant on the Gulf of California in the 1980s . By that time , the cost of desalting water could be cut to 100 per 1,000 gallons . Speaking over the noisy hum of Key West 's desalting plant last week , Vice President Hubert Humphrey ventured a bold prediction . With such breakthroughs , he said , desalination will eventually yield benefits " as great as those bestowed by the development of electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
