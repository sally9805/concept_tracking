The Vocal Girl ; <P> The thing to do when in public , today 's painters like to say , is keep mum and let one 's canvases speak for themselves . But unhappily , not all modern canvases are exactly self-explanatory , and when the painters do open up , the listener can be in for a dizzy experience . Among the most successful of the second generation of the so-called School of New York are the three women whose works are shown in color ( right ) . When they choose , they have a kind of eloquence . <P> Of the three , Helen Frankenthaler , 31 , daughter of a judge , product of Bennington College , wife of First Generation Abstract-Expressionist Robert Motherwell , is in some ways the most daring in her work . " I often start with a canvas on the floor , " she once said , " then work on it on the wall , changing back and forth , working at it from different sides . " She usually begins with no particular idea in mind : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or I simply start . " Gradually , the picture builds- " an amorphous inner-world perspective that lies flat on canvas and yet flies out " - and when it is done , it is given a name . <P> The Frankenthaler canvas is apt to be wall-size , and every square foot can evoke a new mood . At times , the viewer thinks he may be under water , at times in outer space ; often he has the uncomfortable sensation that he is looking at nature 's gizzards . What is it all about ? " I think , " says Helen Frankenthaler , " that painting is a matter of making some kind of beautiful order out of human feeling and experience . " <P> Blonde , intense Grace Hartigan , 38 , has gone through more technical phases than either of her colleagues . She had her School of Paris period , her pure abstract period , and her time with the Old Masters . Then in 1955 , " I began to look outside , to look around me , and I got involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As in City Life II , her colors are pounded into every available space , her strokes seem committed out of rage ; the effect is one of extraordinary power . <P> To one critic , Grace Hartigan 's painting seems to " venture frankly and deliberately into utter chaos . " Nowadays , she gets her inspiration from turning away from the world and looking within . As a result , she says , her paintings are more " objective . " " As soon as I left subject , I was able to go more deeply into content . Now I am trying to find my own internal world rather than the world that is across the street or down the stairs . " <P> Chicago-born Joan Mitchell , 34 , says that New York has become too " big , successful and public . " So in 1958 , Painter Mitchell went to live in Paris . There she wages constant battle against the obtrusive image . " I do n't want to see anything on the canvas , " says she . " For that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yet she is still " bothered by the accuracy of my painting , " for paint ing should be describable in no terms but painting . " It has to mean something . But I do n't know what that means . " .
