JACQUELINE by DELORES PHILLIPS with LEWIS H. LAPHAM Tirginians who know her say that all the new V clothes in Paris and all the old furniture in Washington could not tempt Mrs. John F. Kennedy from a chance to gallop after foxhounds . Although a number of other people grumble at her passion for a sport they think both indecorous and cruel , Mrs. Kennedy continues to hunt , riding at fences and hedgerows with the bravado of a grenadier . On occasion she has neglected ceremonious luncheons in favor of a day 's sport in the field . Throughout the long winter season she rides to hounds at least twice a week , which is often enough to provoke indignant remarks from congressional wives who fear that their company and conversation is less interesting than the sight of a small and rather nasty animal . The standard textbooks on American government recommend that the President 's wife remain above any hint of controversy , that she be a gracious hostess , elegantly dressed , whom schoolchildren should imagine as a fine lady , like the paintings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Kennedy astridea horse , however , have dispelled that particular illusion and have embroiled the Administration in yet another welter of gossip . The White House every week receives a swarm of letters from outraged citizens who , judging from the nature of their complaints , think of fox hunting either as an unnecessary cruelty to animals or a trifling indulgence of the very rich . " The noble science . " apparently , is foreign to the democratic bias of the American electorate . Certainly it is alien to a world of supermarkets , suburbs and howling alleys . It is a sport as inseparably identified with the civilization of the 18th century as is the " New Frontier " with the 20th century . The complaints no doubt arise from popular misconceptions , a failure to appreciate either the rigors or the proprieties of the hunt . Fox hunting is as much an art as it is a sport , demanding of those who follow the chase not only skill and courage but also a sense of decorum . Or , as a Virginia gentleman phrased it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , and a hell of a lot of guts . " Mrs. Kennedy , happily , qualifies in both respects , like the heroine in a sentimental romance . She was , as Hamlet said of himself , " to the manner born . " Her courage is beyond question , having been demonstrated by her willingness to resume the hunt after a fall . Her politeness is extolled by astounded gentlemen riders for whom she has dismounted and opened gates . The ground over which the First Lady chooses to hunt , 40 miles west of Washington in the Piedmont Valley near Middleburg , Va. , is the part of the country she thinks of as home . She has ridden horses there since she was a girl of 16 . She knows the people . She is used to the shape of the hills and the colors of the sky . She feels easy walking through the streets of the town dressed in a faded pair of pants and not caring about her hair . The surrounding countryside , first surveyed by George Washington and later familiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided by well-kept fences and famous now for foxes . The bigger game long since moved westward over the Blue Ridge Mountains , pursued by rude men carrying rifles , dreaming impolitely of empire . The large farms around Middleburg belong to families whose names are synonymous with money , names such as Phipps , Iselin and Mellon . The hills are not too high ; the streams are not too swift . Honeysuckle grows over the old stone walls , and robins sing in the sweet gum trees . The people who live on the land , long accustomed to the privileges of wealth and tradition , speak in slow , soft voices . Their talk is mostly of horses . They can afford to be careless about their clothes . The Kennedys rented Glen Ora , an estate two miles south of Middleburg , within a month of the President 's inauguration . They have since bought property and are building a country house on Rattlesnake Mountain , our miles to the west of the town . The established residents , at first apprehensive about the intrusion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's arrival . A few newspapermen invade the town on weekends . Secret Service agents , easily distinguished by their dark suits and impassive silences , stand solemnly in doorways . Otherwise the town is little changed , undamaged by tourists . Almost everybody in the neighborhood rides to hounds , which is the proper way to say they go fox hunting , and in Middleburg , Va. , it is important in all things to observe the proper etiquette . The fields and woodlands outside the town are partitioned into specific " territories " through which a particular " hunt " ? i.e .. an organized pack of hounds  --  is entitled to search for a fox . The boundaries between these demesnes are as complicated as the boundaries separating the Balkan states prior to World War I. Of the 95 established hunts in the United States , eight are within 30 miles of Middleburg . Among fox hunters the countryside is deemed a paradise , comparable to the old Stillman 's Gym in New York for followers of the prize ring . Mrs. Kennedy usually rides either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The exhilaration of the chase is impossible to explain to people who have not known it . Peter Beckford , the first and most scholarly of the British writers on the subject , proposed the dictum , " Take away the spirit of fox hunting , and it is no longer fox hunting ; it is stale , small beer compared with brisk champagne . " Another British sportsman , discussing the subject in the 19th century , remarked , " These moments of self-sublimation arc probably the core of the fox hunter 's dedication to the sport . All stops are pulled out . The mere physical blossoms into elation , and elation swells almost to the point of spiritual transfiguration . " Mrs. Kennedy , speaking less effusively but to the same point , once told a friend she enjoyed the chase because she could lose herself in it and so " feel clean and anonymous . " For that reason she hoped to interest her husband in the sport , even going so far as to order him a hunting outfit . The President , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back pasture at Glen Ora . He has not as yet ventured into the field . When it was thought the President might also ride to hounds , two Secret Service agents were given riding lessons . They showed as little inclination for the sport as Mr. Kennedy , however , and could never be persuaded to go at any gait faster than a steady walk . The rules and procedures governing the progress of fox hunting are as strict as the sequences of a minuet . These are substantially the same now as when the sport first came into fashion , both in England and Virginia , about 170 years ago . Mrs. Kennedy observes more or less the same formalities as did George Washington when he hunted his own pack of hounds through the same countryside . The several stages of a hunt are comparable to the acts in a play . The dramatis personae are as follows : THE MASTER OF FOXHOUNDS : the man or woman in charge . He directs the sport in the field and must be obeyed without question . R. S. Surtees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set forth in 1845 the qualifications of a successful master : " He should have the boldness of a lion , the cunning of a fox , the shrewdness of an exciseman , the calculation of a general , the decision of a judge , the purse of Squire Plutus , the regularity of a railway , the punctuality of a timepiece , the liberality of a sailor , the patience of lob , the tact of an M.P. , the wiliness of a diplomatist , the politeness of a Lord , the strength of an Hercules , the thirst of a Bacchus , the appetite of a Dando , the digestion of an ostrich , the coolness of a crocodile , the fire-enduring powers of a salamander and a temper as even as the lines in a copybook . " In brief , a paragon among mortal men . The master can wear either a pink coat  --  hunting pink is in fact bright scarlet  --  or a Melton coat of blue or black . He must have knowledge not only of horses and hounds but also of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable in status to a maitre d'h  --  tel in an expensive restaurant and , hopefully , as formidable an individual as the master . He cares for hounds in kennel and deploys them in the field , uttering unintelligible cries , all of which are variations on the traditional theme , " Yoicks . " He must be familiar with the land and is required to know where foxes can be found . He carries the hunting horn . THE WHIPPERS-IN : usually two in number , also hunt servants , comparable to ordinary waiters . They assist with hounds . ( Correct terminology forbids the use of the article , rhe , preceding the noun , hounds . Thus , to say ; " Reginald Smash-gate rode off after the hounds , " is improper and would be thought the sure sign of a novice . ) The huntsman and whippers-in , known collectively as the hunt staff , may wear pink coats and hunting caps . FOXHOUNDS : the agents on whom the hunt relies . They are bred for endurance and keen noses and always are referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half couple of hounds equals 39 hounds . Their names are traditional  --  e.g. , " Albion , " " Baneful , " " Marmaduke , " " Cali-ban , " " Chanticleer " and " Groveller . " HORSES : of any breeding or color , just so they can safely carry their riders over the inevitable obstacles . Horses that kick must wear red ribbons tied to their tails . THE FIELD : the ladies and gentlemen or children who follow the chase . They are expected to present themselves in formal costume . This consists of a Melton coat , a derby or top hat  --  preferably scarred  --  a white stock and buff-colored or white breeches of cord , twill or doeskin . On by-days -- hunts not listed on the monthly " fixture card " ? or on rainy days , it is acceptable to wear " ratcatcher , " the more informal costume that Mrs. Kennedy prefers and which consists of a tweed coat , an ordinary tie and jodhpurs . THE FOX : either red or gray , but otherwise subject to no formalities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wide circles . Despite the seeming unfairness of the odds , the advantage is with the fox , an extremely intelligent animal possessed of a justified contempt for the clumsier forces arrayed against him . Foxes on occasion have been seen to sit thoughtfully on stone walls , watching hounds and horses blunder across a distant field . The Piedmont Fox Hounds last year succeeded in killing but two foxes , both of them somewhat undernourished . Many more foxes are killed every season in Virginia by automobiles than by hounds . The introductory scene to the play of the chase is the " meet , " or gathering of the pack and the field at a predetermined crossroads or country estate . The scene is precisely as it is represented in the conventional prints that decorate the walls of so many taverns and antique shops . The riders , resplendent and proud , exchange pleasantries , ask after their friends and talk of the weather or the holes in the roads . Servants have their place The fox-hunting season extends from late October through early March , between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , therefore , is likely to be cold . Servants hand up coffee or sherry to the gentry on horseback . The oak and sycamore trees stand bleakly against the gray sky . Patches of snow stretch across the stubbled fields . The breath of horses and hounds hangs heavily on the damp air . The meet is customarily called for 10 or I I A.M. , or even later , if it is extremely cold . Mrs. Kennedy is never late  --  the first rule of etiquette  --  except on those mornings when she suspects the presence of newspaper photographers . She then waits to join the field as it " hacks " ? goes at a walk  --  through a nearby woods . If she is not in residence at Glen Ora , she is brought by helicopter from the White House lawn in time to change her clothes . Mrs. Kennedy 's riding clothes arc made by William Gordon , the only tailor in Middleburg . He keeps her patterns , cut out of brown wrapping paper , on a nail stuck into the wall above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted to electricity . Although the rest of Mrs. Kennedy 's clothes are slavishly copied by women across the country , in the matter of a riding outfit even the best dressed woman in the world must bow to the established regulations . The First Lady 's horse , a piebald named " Rufus , " is either brought , c ) Glen Ora or vanned to the " meet " by Mrs. Paul Fout , a friend and neighbor who stables Rufus . Mrs. Kennedy this season has chosen to ride with the Piedmont Fox Hounds more often than with the Orange County Hunt . Piedmont , first organized in 1840 , is among the oldest hunts in the country . Its field is less concerned with the social aspects of the hunt than is Orange County , which was established in 1903 by Edward H. Harriman and named after the county in New York . Those riders in both hunts who have known Mrs. Kennedy since she was a girl address her as " Jackie " and scrupulously avoid all talk of politics . They take elaborate care not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sr. , master of the Piedmont Fox Hounds , is a determined woman who brooks no nonsense and does not indulge in empty flattery . Praise from Mrs. Randolph is praise from Caesar . Offering a professional judgment of the First Lady 's horsemanship , she said Mrs. Kennedy was not a " thruster , " not one of those people who " ride jealous " ? i.e. , crowding the other riders at a jump . The consensus among the riders with whom Mrs. Kennedy follows the chase was best summarized by Mrs. Nelson . McClary , a " regular " with the Orange County Hunt who , under the name Jane McIlvaine , writes stories about horses for children . She said , " I think Mrs. Kennedy is good in the field . She 's always pleasant to be with , very polite , always waits her turn and goes awfully well . She rides with eclat . I 've always been impressed with the way she stays with hounds to the very end . " At the appointed hour the hunt " moves off " in whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sport . The search is more or less systematic . The huntsman proceeds to a covert  --  a sheltered place , usually in a copse or thicket  --  where he hopes to find a fox . The field follows at a discreet walk . Idle conversation , otherwise known as coffeehousing , is frowned upon by the master . Fox hunters regard their pleasure as a serious business and in this respect resemble golfers who stalk their balls around a course in grim silence . Mrs. Kennedy refrains from coffeehousing . She is always intent upon the work at hand . Once arrived at the covert , the huntsman " casts " hounds into the underbrush in hope that 4 they will come upon a fox 's scent , This maneuver is called " drawing the covert . " The master and field meanwhile hold back , about 100 yards distant , downwind from the covert . The hounds snuffling through the woods are said to be " working . " The patient expectation of the field at this point has been expressed by William Bromley Davenport in a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider or a passing farmer see a fox running into an open field , he is entitled to shout , " Tallyho ! " This traditional cry , however , has fallen from favor in recent years , and those enthusiasts who succumb to the temptation of raising it are considered overzealous . Ordinarily the huntsman prefers to trust to hounds . The rank smell of a fox is as easy for the pack to distinguish as the smell of a skunk . If hounds " get on a fox , " they come bounding out of the covert , heads down , running with a lopsided , angular gait and " giving tongue " ? i.e. , barking furiously . It is at this juncture that the hunt begins in earnest . The hounds , " speaking to the line , " set off behind the fox ; the huntsman and whippers-in set off behind the hounds ; the master behind them , and lastly , the field , galloping helter-skelter across the countryside . On those mornings when Mrs. Kennedy rides , yet another element enters into the chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow along the dirt roads , hopelessly confined to automobiles , only briefly glimpsing the hunt as it crosses over a ridge or through a meadow . These gentlemen , in their anxiety , have been known to disregard every rule of hunting protocol . They drive too near a jump , park too near a gate or , worst of all , " turn a fox " ? i.e. , blunder across its line and force it to run in an unlikely direction . The chase can lead anywhere  --  among brambles , over barbedwire , across polo fields , stone walls and streams , even into Middleburg . The Middleburg Hunt , another of the local hunts with which Mrs. Kennedy occasionally rides , last fall pursued a fox through the town . The Rev. Froggie deBordenave , rector of Emmanuel Episcopal Church , stopped traffic while hounds and horses clattered across the main street , otherwise known as U.S. 50 . The fox nevertheless eluded the chase and was believed to have gone to earth somewhere on the property of a citizen who supported the local S.P.C.A. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of the community . Most of the business in Middleburg is , in one way or another , dependent on horses and the people who ride them . A majority of the inhabitants earn their livings as saddlers , grooms , stable hands , horse traders , trainers and drivers of horse vans , trainers of hounds . Stone jockeys stand in rows on Washington Street . Stuffed foxes look down from the mantelpieces in the Red Fox Tavern . The emblem of a running fox is emblazoned above the entrance to the Middleburg National Bank and on the bank 's checks . A " run " after a fox  --  everybody proceeding with all possible haste  --  can last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half . Mrs. Kennedy was on such a run last November when her horse , " Bit of Irish " ? who was subsequently sold  --  refused to jump a post-and-rail fence on Paul Mellon 's " Roleeby Farm . " The First Lady was thrown over the horse 's head . Ignoring the entreaties of the Secret Service agents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and resumed the chase for another two hours . Archie Randolph Jr. , the owner of " Grafton , " a farm in the Piedmont territory , had been riding directly behind her . He helped Mrs. Kennedy to regain her seat , a practice known to horsemen as giving somebody " a leg up . " " I think I was more shattered than she was , " Mr. Randolph later said . " I was so excited that the only thing I was afraid of was that I was going to pitch her over the other side of the horse . " If and when hounds lose the scent of a fox , they become temporarily confused , wandering aimlessly in circles . The field at this point " checks " ? i.e. , waits until the scent is rediscovered or until the huntsman , deciding the fox is lost , casts hounds toward another covert . The coming of the Kennedys to Middleburg could diminish the number of coverts available . Rattlesnake Mountain , heretofore a favorite retreat for foxes , is situated close to the boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Piedmont Fox Hounds . Both hunts are wont to draw the woods on the mountainside in hopes of finding sport . This practice may soon be considered subversive . The climactic scene in the drama of a fox hunt , of course , is the death , a ceremony referred to as " getting the fox . " Only the hard-riding members of the field , Mrs. Kennedy frequently among them , arrive in time to see the hounds tear the fox to pieces . The huntsman awards the fox 's " mask " ( head ) and " bru. sh " ( tail ) to those riders the master of foxhounds deems worthy of the honor . The first time a young boy or girl is present at the end of a hunt , he or she is " blooded " ? i.e. , touched on the hand or face with a fox 's bloody paw . This also is regarded a high honor , and children will not wash their hands for weeks after they have been so marked . The hunt breakfast , contrary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt , sometime between one P.M. and dusk . The riders return tired and cold . Their conversation commonly turns on such questions as where did the fox go after crossing Goose Creek or why did the huntsman decide to draw the Black Forest covert instead of Pole Cat Hill . Mrs. Kennedy joins enthusiastically in the talk . Maybe she will take a glass of Dubonnet . Her eagerness in all things concerning the hunt has been likened by those who know her to the eagerness of a schoolgirl . Perhaps the finest tribute to her conduct in the hunting field , certainty the one that she herself would value above all others , was offered casually  --  the offhand manner is correct in Middleburg  --  by Mary K. Willis . Miss Willis , who owns 500 acres of land , is a small woman distinguished by her clear eyes and weather-beaten face . Of Mrs. Kennedy , she said , " A regular gal who goes out of her way to be just one of the fox hunters . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
