American medicine is the best in the world . <P> <P> MOST Americans take this statement as an article of faith-so long as they are in good health . Even when they have a bout of illness they feel , for the most part , that they are getting excellent care . But growing numbers of patients , the consumers of American medicine , are asking questions that range from mildly nagging to openly angry . <P> When the doctor was first called , why did he refuse to make a house call ? Did he take too long in making the right diagnosis ? Did he prescribe too many drugs before he knew what the real trouble was ? Did he pick the right surgeon to operate ? Were all those lab tests necessary ? Did the surgeon charge too much ? Why does a hospital room cost $60 a day , more than the fanciest resort hotel room ? Why does n't insurance cover more of those bills ? <P> <P> Ingenious and Amazing <P> These questions are asked each year by many of the 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For them , the doctors write a billion prescriptions for a total drug bill of some $3.5 billion . Each year , 27 million Americans go into a general hospital , where they spend an average of 8.2 days and get a bill of $530 , about half of which is covered by insurance . The total cost of U.S. medical care is now $53 billion a year-5.9% of the gross national product , or 7.5% of all personal income . These figures are far higher than those for other Western countries with at least equivalent quality of care . <P> Is the U.S. citizen getting a fair shake for his money ? For an estimated 25% of the population , the answer is yes . For another 50% , medical care can be described as passable , but it is certainly not as good as it could and should be . For 25% , care is either inexcusably bad , given in humiliating circumstances , or nonexistent . The breakdown is not simply by social stratum : the rich do not necessarily get the best care , nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service : " If even one American does n't have access to a reasonable level of care , there 's something wrong . And when millions do n't , there 's obviously something wrong . " <P> As befits a huge industry , U.S. medicine has an impressive plant , and many of its facilities are indeed outstanding . In research and medical technology , the U.S. amazes and leads the world . A newborn baby with a defective heart can probably get the best care at Manhattan 's Lenox Hill Hospital , which operates an elaborate unit exclusively for pediatric cardiology . For surgery on such a baby 's heart , U.S. surgeons are preeminent . So are the surgeons who operate on older patients ' arteries . For trouble in the brain 's arteries , researchers at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center have helped to develop a magnetic probe that will swim through the arterial labyrinth and tell the neurologist what he needs to know . At Harvard , surgeons practice knifeless surgery with a proton gun that destroys overactive tissue deep inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeons turn patients upside down to let gravity help them in repositioning a detached retina . <P> Unhappily , such examples of American medical ingenuity do not make American medicine the world 's best . They are available to only a few . The U.S. ranks 13th ( behind several West European
