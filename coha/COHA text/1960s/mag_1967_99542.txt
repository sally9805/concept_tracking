After a road trip that was worse than usual , calamitous rather than merely disastrous , the 10th-place New York Mets returned last week to Shea Stadium where two of their nutty fans displayed a banner suggesting the hiring of Israel 's General Moshe Dayan . A fine idea , except that the first opponent on the home stand was league-leading Cincinnati , and the closest any of the Reds had been to Egypt was Cairo , Ill. // The series started with a twi-night doubleheader , and Cincy easily won the first game behind the five-hit , shutout pitching of rookie Gary Nolan . // But in the second game the Mets produced their own special rookie pitcher , Tom Seaver , who beat the Reds 7-3 and showed a sample of his exceptional poise in the sixth inning . With runners on second and third and no outs , he forced Floyd Robinson to pop up and struck out Vada Pinson and Pete Rose . He tired in the ninth and lost his shutout , but the job was typical of what Seaver has been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Against the Cubs he pitched a four-hitter over 10 innings and scored the winning run himself . Against Atlanta he lost a 4-3 game but hit two doubles and a single , stole a base and had two RBIs . He beat the Dodgers with a five-hitter and stole another base . Through last weekend Tom had a 5-4 record , praiseworthy on a basement team , and if his performance was un-Metlike , it was hardly unexpected by another team to which he happens to belong  --  the sharpshooting , par-busting , raisin-packing Seaver family out of Fresno , Calif. and points east . // The patriarch is Tom 's father , Charles Seaver Sr. , a fine amateur golfer . He was a two-handicapper at age 15 , the same as he is today at the Sunnyside Country Club in Fresno . He was the Stanford University champion in 1932 , beating Lawson Little , and the same year was on the Walker Cup team captained by Francis Ouimet . The elder Seaver also played football and basketball at Stanford , came within a hole of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chance to meet Bobby Jones in his last match as an amateur , and , with Pro Mike Fetchick , won the Bing Crosby Pro-Am in 1964. // " He and Fetchick play together every year at the Crosby , " said a veteran golf writer . " He 's a great competitor , one of the few amateurs who can handle Pebble Beach , because he 's so powerful . When there 's wind and rain , Charles will be out there playing just as well as Fetchick. " // Tom 's mother is also a good golfer and a regular at Sunnyside . His Aunt Katie , friends remember , had no trouble lugging an old-fashioned 75-pound surfboard around the beaches of Hawaii . Another Katie , his oldest sister , was a good swimmer and volleyball player at Stanford and was famous around school for flattening a guy who got fresh with her one day at a campus pub . Brother Charles Jr. , now a Brooklyn social worker who brings a batch of underprivileged kids to each home game Tom pitches , swam one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education major at UCLA and spent two years in Nigeria with her husband , a Peace Corps official . It was no shock when Tom , the baby of the family , turned out to be a fine athlete . // He is also a soft-spoken gentleman of the Sandy Koufax school , autographing photographs , answering repetitious questions and accepting the wisecracks of his teammates , all without complaint . He is working toward a college degree in public relations and it shows . " Poised " is the adjective most often stuck on him . // " I do n't find myself jumping up and down , " he says . " I smile , but that 's as far as I let my emotions carry me. " // He recently joined a couple of his teammates in visiting the prisoners at Sing Sing , and on his first day off after coming home from the horrible road trip he went to a Bronx hospital and made a tape recording for the Bedside Network , a veterans ' organization . He may be doing such things because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , but more likely it is the same unostentatious idealism his brothers and sisters picked up somewhere in their Fresno upbringing . // Fresno is a pleasant place to grow up in . It lies in the middle of California 's agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley and consists mainly of farmers , Armenian merchants and budding baseball players ( major league pitchers Wade Blasingame , Dick Ellsworth , Jim Maloney and Dick Selma also come from there ) . For excitement at night you can stew some figs or maybe drive over to Taft and watch the oil rigs bob up and down in the moonlight . The sun shines brightly nearly every day , and boxes of raisins are shipped out regularly from the packing company where Tom 's father is vice president . // Almost every Sunday when Tom was a boy his parents would golf at Sunnyside while the young Seavers ducked each other in the club swimming pool . The three males in the family hunted quail at every opportunity in the nearby foothills . Tom is a right-handed pitcher , batter and writer , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Marines a sergeant insisted he switch over . // " Out he came with an eye patch , " said his father , " put it over his left eye and in two weeks he was an expert marksman with his right hand . Now he 's back to shooting left-handed. " // " Pop is the best hunter , " said Charles Jr . " At Christmas we were all home . We hunted quail and he left us in the dust . Tom 's a professional athlete but Dad was leaving him behind . He 'd go bouncing over the hills and then wait for us . He 's like a mountain goat . " // Tom was a good basketball and baseball player at Fresno High , yet not one scout so much as nodded to him . He was small , and his fast ball would not squash a grape . But Marine Corps mess halls accomplished what years of raisins and quails could not . He went in the corps for six months , worked at his father 's plant for six months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 " ) and 45 pounds heavier ( 190 ) . // After a good season at Fresno City College and a summer in Fairbanks pitching for the Alaska Goldpanners , Tom was given a baseball grant-in-aid by USC , one of the few big universities in the state that had been Seaverless . Trojan Coach Rod Dedeaux is a successful trucking executive who , as a sideline , develops major league talent and wins championships . // As a junior Seaver had a 10-2 record and struck out 100 batters in 106 innings . He roomed with Coach Dedeaux 's son , Justin , and left Justin strongly impressed with his pitching , his cooking of self-shot pheasant and his running , which the Mets have come to appreciate , too . // " His speed fools you , " says Justin . " He 's one of the best base runners I 've ever seen . He studies the pitchers , knows their moves , knows their little idiosyncrasies , and this gives him the jump . // " Dad used to have the team run wind sprints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrett . Mike might win one time by a stride at 75 yards . The next time they 'd dead-heat . Once in a while Tom might have an edge . " // The Dodgers picked Seaver in the free-agent draft of June 1965 but made no effort to sign him . He was available again in the January 1966 draft , so the Braves picked him and began negotiations . When he was signed for a bonus of about $50,000 , the USC baseball season already had started  --  which is too late to sign a college ballplayer , according to current baseball law  --  but the Braves assured him everything was O.K. as long as the Trojans ' league games had not started . // Dedeaux was not exactly overjoyed ( Ron Fairly of the Dodgers , Barry Lat-man of the Astros and Gary Sutherland of the Phils are some other players he lost while they had eligibility left ) , but Tom and his girl friend , Nancy , were happy , for now they could get married . His parents planned a gala party in Fresno for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first cork was to pop , Braves General Manager John McHale phoned and told Tom that the commissioner 's office had voided the contract . It turned out that the rule held whether the games were in league or out . The party went on anyway . // Tom would have rejoined the Trojans , but the NCAA declared him ineligible . Suddenly he was not only $50,000 poorer , he was a man without a country , neither pro nor amateur . In the flurry of phone calls that followed , from Fresno to Atlanta to the baseball commissioner 's office , Seaver occasionally found himself wondering whether he was talking to MacPhail ( Lee ) of the commissioner 's office or McHale ( John ) of the Braves . // Commissioner Eckert finally ruled that any club but the Braves that was willing to pick up the $50,000 bonus tab could put in a claim for Seaver . The Phillies , Indians and Mets stepped forward and , as Tom listened via long-distance telephone , New York 's name was picked out of a hat , perhaps John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived so long with bad luck  --  came up with a base-stealing , right-hand-throwing , left-hand-shooting pitching phenom , and how USC lost the national baseball championship . The Trojans , without Tom , went to the college World Series at Omaha in 1966 and lost to Ohio State 1-0 ( the Buckeye pitcher , Steve Arlin , subsequently signed with the Phillies for a $100,000 bonus ) . If Seaver had been pitching that day , muses Rod Dedeaux , " the game might still be in extra innings . "
