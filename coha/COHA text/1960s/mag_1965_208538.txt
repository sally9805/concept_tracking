" In Italy , " says Count Ferdinando Sarmi , " when the oldest son tells his father he wants to be a dress designer , it 's like a woman saying she intends to be a prostitute . " Sarmi 's own father responded by packing his son off to the university in Siena . The result was to make Sarmi , some 30 years later , the only Seventh Avenue designer who holds a doctor of law degree . <P> Women could n't care less . To them the important thing about Sarmi is that he turns out some of the world 's most elegant evening dresses . " Every woman with $600 to spend , " says one New York buyer , " wants to own a Sarmi . " <P> At the preview of his fall and winter collection last week , Sarmi produced 50 evening ensembles-every one of them made for a grand entrance . Typically , he committed himself to no single shape , cavalierly offering up silhouettes ranging from tentlike A-lines to baggy harem skirts . What interests Sarmi is fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth-of-gold studded with glass " jewels , " acres of feathery chiffon , columns of ostrich plumes , bands of chinchilla , and bodices of shimmering bugles and bangles . <P> Each year Sarmi makes two trips to Switzerland , France and Italy to select his fabrics . He has the lace re-embroidered with silver and gold , the chiffon treated to produce a raised velvet pattern , the dress wools interwoven with rows of iridescent paillettes . Often he designs his own : one year it was photographs of raindrops screened onto fine silk , another time it was magnified butterfly wings . <P> At 49 , Sarmi is a heavy-lidded , darkly handsome man who lives for his work . He came to the U.S. in 1951 , when Elizabeth Arden hired him as her salon designer . In 1959 , with his reputation well established , he went into business on his own . " I make clothes to enhance a woman 's beauty or to hide her faults , " says Sarmi . " I hate the ambiguity of women 's clothes today . What for is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a woman but an ersatz man in pants ? " Sarmi creations offer a woman frills but not fuss , flourishes but not flash , take her to the ball secure in the knowledge of her own absolute femininity . <P> Sarmi 's designs are almost copy-proof . Highlight of this season 's show , for instance , is a full-length empire coat made entirely of swansdown ( $4,500 ) . For the budget-minded lady or fashion pirate who wants to whip up an economy model , the directions would have to start : First you take 14 dozen swans . . .
