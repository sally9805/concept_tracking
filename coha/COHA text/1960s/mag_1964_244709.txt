In New York City , politicians were asking this question : Can a bright , young , energetic , ambitious Jew get elected to Congress from a heavily Jewish district if he has an Arab name ? <P> Some question ! But it was one that last week confronted Democratic Candidate William Haddad . At 35 , Haddad has been around . He was a merchant marine officer during World War II , an aide to Senator Estes Kefauver , a prize-winning investigative newspaper reporter , an assistant to Bobby Kennedy during the 1960 presidential campaign , and a top administrator in the Peace Corps . Further enhancing his political credentials among Democrats is the fact that he is married to Franklin Roosevelt 's granddaughter Kate . Her parents , California 's Democratic Congressman James Roosevelt and Betsey Gushing Roosevelt , were divorced when Kate was four ; Betsey later married New York Herald Tribune Publisher John Hay Whitney , who legally adopted Kate . <P> Such Talk Can Ruin . All this would seem to make Bill Haddad a likely Democratic reform candidate in the June 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type who is seeking a fifth term in Manhattan 's meandering 19th Congressional District . But , of all things , Haddad did not count on getting hurt by the district 's Jewish vote . <P> Last week he complained that Farbstein , who likes to remind his constituency that he is the only Jew on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is an ardent supporter of Israel , was spreading rumors all over the district that Haddad is an Arab . Not only that ; people were sending around anonymous notes about him ( " Can you trust an ARAB to fight for the interests of Jews and for Israel ? " ) . Even worse , said Haddad , Farbstein was going about telling folks that Haddad was born an Egyptian , that he got married in the Protestant Episcopal Church and thus was a meshumad ( an apostate from Judaism ) . In the 19th District , where 50% of the voters are Jews , such talk can ruin a politician . <P> All for Ethnics . Haddad , naturally , was outraged over the whispering campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that his mother is a Russian-born Jew who keeps a kosher home , and that his father had the misfortune of having been born in Cairo to Egyptian Jews . He protested to the Fair Campaign Practices Committee , issued statements , got Jimmy Roosevelt to make a public statement on his behalf , and met with Yiddish-language newspaper editors in an attempt to convince them that he is just as Jewish as Farbstein . <P> Though he knows that he is a goner without the Jewish vote , he decried the necessity of having to defend his Jewish credentials . Said he : " If I have to be Jewish to win this campaign , it 's not worth winning . I do n't want the voters to elect me to Congress because I am a Jew . I hope they wo n't reject me because I am married to a Protestant . <P> And I do n't want the Farbstein organization to brand me an Arab because my father was born an Egyptian Jew .
