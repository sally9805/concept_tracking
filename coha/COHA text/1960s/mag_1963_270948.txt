The light of morning showed only a few tangled pieces of metal , and an ugly , water-filled crater-6 ft. deep and 150 ft. wide . It was all that remained of Trans-Canada Airlines Flight 831 , a DC-8F jet with seven crew and 111 passengers aboard . At 6:30 p.m. , the big red-and-silver jetliner lifted off Montreal 's rainswept International Airport and banked left on course for Toronto 320 miles to the southwest . Four minutes later , townsfolk in Ste. Thrse de Blainville heard a thunderous explosion as the plane slammed into a muddy field . The kerosene-fed fire raged for hours , despite the heavy downpour . <P> There were no survivors , and no immediate clues to the crash . It was the second-worst commercial single-plane disaster in history , surpassed only by an Air France crash in Paris last year that killed 130.
