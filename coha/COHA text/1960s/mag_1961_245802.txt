Though it is twice the size of Texas West Africa 's arid , landlocked Mali Republic ( pop . 3,700,000 ) has little claim to fame beyond being the place where Timbuctoo is . Last week the news from Timbuctoo , now a crumbling mud village on the edge of the Sahara , was that the Russians would soon be there . <P> Back in the days when it was still the French Sudan , Mali eked out a tenuous living on French colonial subsidies . When the Sudanese were granted autonomy from France in 1958 , they sought to solve their economic problems by joining neighboring and more prosperous Senegal in the Mali Federation . But eight months ago , the Senegalese , fearful of Sudanese domination , seceded from the federation ; they also refused the Sudanese ( who stubbornly clung to the name Mali ) further access to Senegal 's great , modern port of Dakar . With no outlet to the sea and nothing to sell on world markets save peanuts , kapok and a little rice and dried fish , Mali 's Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West against East . <P> Right from the start , the pickings were pretty fair . The French went on buying Mali 's peanut crop at above-market prices , Britain furnished four DC-3s to get Air Mali into business , West Germany 's Krupp advanced $6,000,000 in credits to permit the Mali government to buy 300 trucks , and the U.S. anted up $2,500,000 , mostly in cement and gasoline . Entering enthusiastically into the competition , the Common Market nations jointly granted $2,700,000 for irrigation and medical supplies , and Red China signed a barter deal : Chinese machinery and building supplies for Mali 's agricultural products and handicrafts . <P> Fortnight ago , Moscow got into the act . After treating half a dozen Mali officials to a princely tour of Russia , the Soviets came up with the handsomest offer yet : $44 million in long-term credits . <P> Most of the Soviet aid will go for more or less worthy development projects , including preliminary work on a railway line and help in exploiting Mali 's largely unexplored deposits of iron , gold and phosphates . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project that is purely for show : a football stadium for Mali 's isolated capital of Bamako.
