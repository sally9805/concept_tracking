THE Army National Guard , which Defense Secretary McNamara is determined to reform , can rightfully claim that it is older than the nation . It grew out of the " citizen-soldiers " of the colonial militia and gradually evolved into state-organized units that have fought in every war from the Revolution to Korea . In World War II , 18 National Guard divisions went into combat . It took up to two years of training to get them ready-a traditional weakness of the Guard-but they went on to compile a record of gallantry on every front . <P> Political Pals . In war , the Guard is controlled by the Pentagon ; in peacetime , although the Federal Government pays for 97% of its budget , it is primarily a state-organized fighting force under control of the Governor , who is the commander in chief of the units in his state . He appoints his own adjutant general , often a political pal with a sketchy military background . <P> In turn , the adjutant general can hire hundreds of " technicians . " fulltime state employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . In addition , a skillful Governor can often add a new armory or two every few years for deserving towns ; federal funds meet 75% of the cost , and a local contractor usually gets the job . Georgia has built 65 armories during the past decade under a plan mapped out by Governor Vandiver when he was adjutant general . <P> The present National Guard is divided into 4.336 units dispersed throughout more than 2,600 U.S. communities . Technically , it has 27 divisions , but 21 are so poorly equipped and manned ( 50% to 65% of authorized strength ) that they have little military value . For the most part , the Guard is composed of a hard core of devoted World War II or Korean veterans , plus recruits ranging in age from 17 to 26 who escape the two-year draft by taking a six-month tour with the Army , then return home to spend from three to 5 years with their local units . Guardsmen " train " for two hours a week , go off to summer camp for 15 days every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many states , the Guard is primarily a small-town operation that serves as both social center and employer . Georgia estimates that a 100-man unit brings in $52,379 in federal pay and allowances every year . Says Major General George J. Hearn . Georgia 's adjutant general : " The Guard is a kind of livelihood for boys in the country and in small towns . " More than that , the Guard armory is often a town 's most impressive edifice , and a social mecca of food sales , high school graduations , civic meetings and basketball games . <P> Powerful Force . For such reasons - plus the fact that it is always ready and available to fight riots , blizzards or floods-the National Guard is a popular and powerful force . Frequent efforts to cut or reform the Guard have been met with outcries of rage from states , communities and guardsmen alike . Says an official of the National Guard Bureau in the Pentagon : " In many communities , the Guard is just like the fire department . Look around and you 'll see even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big guns in the Guard . If they are n't , they probably once were . And if you step on the Guard , you 're stepping on the home-town folks .
