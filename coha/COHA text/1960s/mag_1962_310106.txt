For years , women have built beehives , French twists and bouffant extravaganzas out of their hair , hung flashing objects from it , plunged metal and wire supports into it , and gone out-of-doors stiff-necked for fear it will all come apart . Last week , still dissatisfied with their own , clearly inadequate hair , U.S. women were turning to wigs . <P> In Manhattan , Macy 's set up a special wig department , which was jammed with more than 1,000 women a day clamoring for synthetic ( all-Dynel ) wigs , at $49.50 . Helena Rubinstein christened a posh new room the Wig-Wig . Max Miller , president of the Joseph Fleischer custom wig company , opened ten new consulting rooms to handle the flood of buyers . Max Factor in Hollywood had to set up folding chairs in the halls to handle capacity crowds . The Elizabeth Arden Salon in Chicago extended its usual three-week wait on wig orders to two months . <P> <P> Peasants ' Is Best . American women , who for almost 200 years had not worn wigs except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to make up for the loss of time . And no one was more astonished than Paris Couturier Givenchy , who started the whole thing in 1958 when he clapped wigs on his mannequins ' heads . He thought it was a gag . Three years later , American women , slow to see the joke , finally saw the potential : brunettes , with only one life to lead , could turn blonde overnight ; straight-haired women could have the curls they pinned for ; a Cleopatra by day could let down her own long hair at night , without having suffered the irreversible decision of a haircut ; two heads , or three , were clearly better than one . More expensive too . A wig of all-human hair ( the finest comes from the peasant women of southern Italy ) costs an average $250 , but there are compensations . <P> Unlike a human scalp , a wig 's base produces no natural oil . Thus a dry cleaner can do every six weeks what a hairdresser has to do once a week ; and best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , $250 is a fairly stiff price ( really fine custom wigs can cost as much as $1,500 ) and at first wig-wearers consisted mostly of actresses , among them Shirley Booth , Judy Holliday . Kim Novak and Zsa Zsa Gabor ( who lost nine of her twelve wigs in last year 's Bel Air fire ) . <P> Patent-Leather Style . Machine-made models appeared , but they looked fake and felt creepy . Then , a couple of months ago , a synthetic wig made of Dynel was introduced that looked like hair , felt like hair , kept its curl ( or coiffure ) for months without resetting , and was relatively cheap . Imitators and competitors came up with part-hair , part-nylon models ( like the Myerlon wigs , at $35 ; the acetate , at $10.95 ) , and even with cheap , phony party or swim-cap versions . <P> Accessories have now blossomed : wig blocks , costing an average $8.50 , provide a stand for the hair , and metal table clamps , averaging $7.50 , hold the wig block in place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wig cases . <P> For only $150 , a second head , though it ca n't go as cheaply as one , can travel in great patent-leather style .
