Europe ? Where 's That ? Since the defeat of Japan , the United States has fought two Asian wars . Today we have two divisions stationed in South Korea , 30,000 fighting men in Thailand , and are hip-deep in a war in Vietnam . When President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk refer to " our allies , " they are most often talking about the Philippines and South Korea . The white Australians and New Zealanders are encouraged to think of themselves as threatened by a spreading communist Yellow Peril , from which American power will protect them , provided they show the flag in Vietnam . Australasia is now in the American , not the British , sphere of influence . The US tends to be snooty toward its old European allies , Britain and France , principally because they could n't care less about Vietnam , except to wish that we would stop bombing the North and would get out of the place . Our reaction to that sort of churlishness is to warn that if the Europeans wo n't help us patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have in Europe may have to be pulled out . That hint falls a little flatter each time it is made and increasingly risks a European retort of " Why do n't you ? " The Europeans wo n't try to pry us out of Vietnam but they wo n't help us fight either , for they think that our Asia policy , and especially our attitude toward China , is foolish . They are inclined to reflect that if US policy toward China seriously represents our idea of realistic diplomacy , perhaps Europe would be better off without a US presence . The radical change that has taken place in the last five years is that Europeans have become less afraid of the Russians than they are of the US landing itself and them in a third global war . Russia may be at loggerheads with China , but the Russians are not at the moment shooting at anything , save possibly American planes over North Vietnam . Because the Soviet Union is not behaving in a warlike way but also because it continues to take an ardent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed , in polite European society . This month , the European political stage was dominated by a Russian and a Frenchman : not an American in sight . Mr. Kosygin had no difficulty in presenting himself in Paris at General de Gaulle 's side as a good European . On the other hand , the principal American contribution to Atlantic events was to have helped bring down the Erhard administration in West Germany . He had been summoned to Washington at the end of September to explain to Defense Secretary McNamara 's satisfaction West Germany 's failure to provide the cost of keeping US troops in Europe . Erhard had several excuses to offer , but as he refused to do as he was told , he was shipped back to Bonn without having got any understanding here of his budgetary and other problems . Now our officials fatalistically anticipate that US relations with Erhard 's coalition successors will be considerably cooler than they were with Erhard , a prospect that seems not to worry anyone with much influence in the only place that counts , which is the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bad policy if it were a policy ? if the decision had been made to stand aloof intentionally and thus encourage the Europeans to settle the continent 's affairs by themselves . But there is nothing deliberate about it . We have simply not put our minds to what Europe wants and what it is becoming , and the consequence is that Europe leaves us behind , because it has to . For example , an intelligent policy decision would have been for the US to say openly that a multilateral nuclear force is no longer feasible . But no , we can not even bring ourselves to bury the dead . On our Atlantic door we have hung an " engaged " sign : too busy in Asia to bother with Europe . So the Europeans try to do something without consulting their formidable American ally ? and are labeled Gaullist ingrates . The most significant thing that Kosygin said in Paris was to promise : " If NATO is dissolved , we shall dissolve the Warsaw pact . " Paris was a good place to make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Treaty Organization for all practical purposes . Kosygin knows too that the very notion of further dismantling the cumbersome and archaic machinery of NATO always drives the Pentagon and the State Department up the wall , but that the chances are scores to one against Washington 's producing any interesting or constructive counterproposals . Kosygin coolly went on to propose a European security conference , which he has done before ; now , however , he is pressing for it , emphasizing that " this question is now ripe . " Graciously he did not wholly bar the possibility of American participation , but said that , of course , this was " for the Europeans to decide . " The Russians want " peaceful coexistence " with the United States and " friendship " with France and other European countries ; these were Kosygin 's carefully selected phrases . The US wants peaceful coexistence with Russia , largely so we can give undivided attention to our Asian wars . The Russians , and the Poles , have a number of plans ready to lay before a European security conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Central Europe . The US Arms Control Agency probably could match them , but does the White House have time left over from Vietnam to concentrate on such matters ? The administration 's absorption in summit meetings with Marshal Ky may some day end in ourexclusion , by no means entirely voluntary , from a summit meeting held across the Atlantic and called " European , " but including Russia . One reason besides domestic problems that West Germany 's two major political parties agreed on a coalition which controls 447 of the West German parliament 's 496 seats was in order to achieve a bipartisan foreign policy that is no longer bound to the wishes of the Americans . Neither the Social Democrats nor the Christian Democrats acting alone dare tell the electorate that the " lost German territories " in Polish possession since World War II really are lost , or that communist East Germany is likely to be around a long time . The coalition is headed by a significant troika : ex-Nazi Chancellor Kurt-Georg Kiesinger , ex-communist All-German Affairs Minister Wehner , and anti-Nazi , anticommunist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left wing in this coalition , the Social Democrats may have created a political vacuum to be filled by neo-Nazis like the growing National Democratic Party . There is at least a chance , however , that the Germans are now headed for what President Johnson calls " peaceful engagement " with one another and with Russia and France . Soviet oil pipeline networks and Italian auto plants are gradually pulling Europe together , all the way to the Urals ; the fear of communist hegemony is fading and nowhere are there armies of despairing unemployed waiting to be manipulated by a new fuehrer or duce . Foul though the weather is in Asia , in Europe the reading is toward fair , but that is in spite of , not because of , Washington . Banks and South Africa South Africa has never enjoyed a high rating on the list of America 's protest priorities . From time to time , however , committees and individuals have attempted to demonstrate their repulsion to apartheid , and the object of attack has usually been US business . There is a brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like $80o million invested in South Africa , and there is yearly dealing of perhaps $700 million ( quite heavily in favor of the US ) . General Motors , Caltex , Mobil Oil , the Engelhard interests , Firestone , Crown-Zellerbach and others have a considerable stake in the stability of the white racist regime . The State Department makes occasional disapproving noises about South Africa policies ( and this year the US voted against South African practices in its Southwest Africa mandate ) , but for the most part the United States hopes for continued stability and " gradual improvement . " In back of US industrial investments are major American banks , and because they have a more direct relationship with ordinary customers on a day-to-day basis , they have been the favorite target of the protestors . Last year , there were demonstrators at the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York , and a campaign of deposit withdrawals was begun . It did not get very far , but in the past few months ? perhaps because of the Rhodesian crisis ? South Africa has appeared more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last month , the journal Christianity and Crisis called for a wide attack on the banks that support the South African government , and an ad-hoc committee singled out Chase-Manhattan and the First National City Bank for special opprobrium . Those two are the biggest partners in a consortium of banks which gives South Africa a $4o-million revolving credit account . It has been used only infrequently , but it puts South Africa 's mind at ease . After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960 , when foreign capital began to leave South Africa , the government and its development corporation had the large dollar credit to fall back on . ( There was other US aid for the South African economy . ) Besides the credit account , Chase and First National City have investment loans of some $23 million in South Africa , some of it going indirectly to arms manufacture , and First National City has four branches in the country . Last week , the first fruits of the anti-bank campaign were seen . A. Philip Randolph , the old civil rights leader who heads the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $22 million have been withdrawn from the two big banks . Who were the withdrawers remained a mystery . About $300,000 came from small depositors , but a union-management pension fund took out $5 million and a large corporation was reported to have withdrawn upwards of $15 million . The total withdrawals just about equal the two banks ' investments in South Africa . Next week , major Protestant denominations begin annual meetings around the country , and , with a push from the Christianity and Crisis people , they will discuss the possibility of large-scale withdrawals from the banks . The Methodists , who are particularly aroused over South Africa , meet in January . No one pretends that the churches can bring the banks , much less the South African government , to their knees , but the banks at least are conscious of their " image " and treat any protest , however small , with some anxiety . One girl who withdrew her small deposit from First National City got a personal letter from Vice President Ward B. Stevenson , arguing against her position and claiming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar foreign exchange position of the South African government . " Some of First National City 's best friends , he said , were black Africans ; " We do not endorse the practice of apartheid in any fashion . "
