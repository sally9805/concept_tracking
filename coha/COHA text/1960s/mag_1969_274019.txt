The most tragic , and in some ways most mysterious , form of mental illness in children is infantile autism . Autistic* children live in a lonely and unbreakable trance . As babies , they seldom look into their mothers ' eyes , they never reach out to be picked up and cuddled . By the age of about two , they have withdrawn completely from the world , ignoring the people around them in favor of the Teddy bears or dolls to which they become fanatically attached . The smallest departure in routine can send them into screaming paroxysms ; some must wear tiny football helmets to prevent them from smashing their heads against a wall . <P> Unlike children afflicted with brain damage , the victims of autism often display tantalizing flashes of intelligence . Some can memorize long , complicated stories with flawless accuracy ; many have perfect pitch . Psychiatrists differ widely in their views on the cause of autism , and real cures have been rare . In Washington last week , discussions at the annual meeting of the National Society for Autistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along some new paths . <P> No Blame . Parents of autistic children have never had much reason for hope . Until Dr. Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins University identified and defined the disease in 1943 , most doctors concluded that autistic children were mentally retarded , and could recommend nothing more than packing them off to a vegetable-like existence in a custodial institution . Kanner , taking more careful note of their mental abilities , concluded that the disease was a psychosis . He felt that the condition was innate , but noted that many parents of autistic children were highly intellectual and emotionally cold- " refrigerator parents , " as he called them . Other experts in autism , including Chicago Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim , accept the theory that parental rejection is the basic cause of the children 's problems . <P> The specialists who belong to the National Society-and the parents who founded the organization 3 years ago - strongly disagree . They point out that the symptoms of autism usually develop in a baby 's first weeks , seemingly well before strong parental influence is possible .

Some researchers hope that autism will turn out to be similar to cretinism and phenylketonuria ( or P.K.U. ) - products of some defective chemistry affecting the nervous system . Meanwhile , a growing number of experts would like to sidestep the question of parental blame and concentrate on teaching autistic children acceptable substitutes for their difficult and harmful behavior . Says Dr. Leon Eisenberg , chief of psychiatry at Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital : " Guilt is the most useless commodity available . "
