Although he is a hereditary ' member of the Republican Establishment , and a professional intellectual to boot , he has become one of Johnson 's most trusted aides . And he may be his generation 's leading candidate for the title of " statesman . " " I believe in Heraclitus , " he once said to me . And I believe that remark , delivered casually on an occasion of almost no consequence , provides a key to one of the most important , fascinating , and elusive figures in American public life ? the President 's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs . McGeorge Bundy . For Heraclitus , as all ex-schoolboys , or at least those from the age before the new math , will surely remember , was the famous pre-Socratic thinker who first stressed the idea of ceaseless change . - Man , like a light in the night , is kindled and put out " was one of his precepts .

" Fire , that homely example of animation incarnate , was for him the prime substance . In his view of the world , all things were in motion , on their way to becoming other things . He was the philosopher of process . Bundy , in the deepest sense , is an organizer of process . He organizes , to be more specific , the process of Presidential decision in foreign affairs . His daily job is to present to Harper 's Magazine , November 1 the President , in coherent and concise fashion , the oceans of information that flow in from the State Department , the Defense Department , and the intelligence community . At a slightly higher level , Bundy organizes meetings of special task forces and of the National Security Council to thrash out issues for presentation to the President . It was Bundy , for example , who set up the meetings that established American policy during the Cuban missiles crisis . Likewise , it was Bundy who put together , when the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens and experts to work up , under the direction of former Deputy Secretary of Defense , Roswell Gilpatric , a report on the problem of preventing further spread of nuclear weapons . " Executive energy , " he once wrote , speaking of academic institutions but using again the key word ( italicized here ) , " always depends for its effectiveness on a most intensive process of consultation and consensus . " From Option to Option But Bundy is , of course , much more than a mere coordinator . He sits in on the highest and innermost policy consultations ? the President 's weekly luncheons with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Defense Secretary Robert S , McNamara . At critical times he has headed Presidential missions to Vietnam and the Dominican Republic . He has under him a staff of regional specialists and experts in economics and defense matters who are in constant touch with developments abroad as they affect various Departments . To be sure , because so much of his work is embedded in the matrix of the Presidency and its relations with the Departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own actions and opinions , in the rare cases when they do emerge , seem once again to be in line with holding open a door that is being slammed , with righting a balance that has been tilted , with keeping the game going . They are directed not toward a particular aim so much as toward keeping alive a process . As one of Bundy 's former assistants once put it , " There are three kinds of people in the policy game . There are those with options who are looking for positions . There are those with positions who are looking for options . And there are those with options who are looking for options . Bundy is a creature from the third species . " Probably the best-known example of the ceaseless search for options is the Presidential mission to the Dominican Republic which Bundy led two weeks after the American landings last April . When he arrived , American soldiers and American diplomats were day-by-day lining this country up more and more with the For reasons of health , and because of a. commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be serving " Harper 's " as its regular Washington Correspondent . He will continue to write for the magazine , on an occasional basis . right-wing Junta under General Antonio Imbert Barreras against the left-wing Constitutionalists , under Colonel Francisco Caamafio The Bundy mission enforced upon the American military a genuine neutrality as between right and left . Bundy himself initiated negotiations with Caamalio , trying to construct a coalition backed by both the Junta and the Constitutionalists . That effort , after coming within an inch of success , collapsed . But three months later , almost exactly the same arrangement was worked out by other intermediaries . In his prime mission , Bundy had succeeded . He had kept the game going . The process was still moving . He played a similar role in the famous crisis at the tail end of last year on that tiresome subject , the Multilateral Force , or MLF . In the spring of the year , President Johnson had indicated that before the year was out he would initiate definite steps toward the establishment of a sea-based NATO nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Secretary of Defense , various American representatives abroad , and , above all , the Bonn Government believed that a firm commitment had been made . Then in October , Harold Wilson came to power in Britain with a policy at odds with the MLF . General de Gaulle broke a long-standing hands-off position to declare open opposition to MLF . After the American election . groups of American Senators returned from the Continent with deep misgivings about the projected nuclear force . Plainly , the President was in a box and he needed an exit . In an exhaustive policy review , just before Prime Minister Wilson visited Washington in early December , Bundy arranged for a way out . The review came up with a formula whereby the President stayed true to his obligation but Left the working of the MLF up to the British and the West Germans . So far , these two have not yet agreed . The President is still off the hook and no one ? not even the West Germans ? can give color to a claim that he has let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , but abortive , Bundy mission that attracted wide public attention was almost certainly moving along the same lines . On February 11 ( 1 WASHINGTON INSIGHT third of this year , Bundy began his one- and- only visit so far ? to South Vietnam . Two days later , Vietcong guerrillas attacked the American air base at Pleiku , killing nine United States airmen and wounding a hundred and forty . In retaliation the President initiated the bombing of North Vietnam . But the decision to bomb the North had already been taken by President Johnson on a contingency basis . It is a good guess that Bundy was visiting Vietnam to see for the President whether the implementation of the decision was actually necessary . Though the Pleiku attack forced his hand and the hand of the President , Foindy 's purpose had been , once again , to free the President , to keep the options open , to keep the process in motion . Brains for Openers When the stakes are so high and the issues so doubtful , very special qualities are required to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a starter , there is intelligence . It is by now well known that he got the best grades ever , or close to them , at Groton and Yale , that he was a Junior Fellow at Harvard , and Dean of the Faculty there at thirty-four . None of these grace marks , however , convey the force of his mind . It is perhaps more helpful to note that he took his A.B . in mathematics ; for the furor ntathentaticus is probably the only undergraduate enthusiasm that requires intellectual openers , the crossing of a brain-power threshold , a true capacity for abstraction . Even more impressive , to me anyhow , is the inexhaustible store of metaphor and allusion that Bundy pours forth spontaneously in explanation of the most difficult concepts . On the theme of how the Soviets might more effectively have lulled the West after World War II , for example , he once wrote : " It is hard to believe that a few trained seals could not have been sent to meetings of UNESCO , for instance , with orders to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well before the question had crystallized of whether President Johnson should have a structured staff with fixed assignments or a homogenized staff of interchangeable cronies , Bundy was at once describing and settling the issue with : " If the President likes toeat tapioca pudding , let him eat tapioca pudding . " " There are many who appear to think that the way to win the Cold War is to move it underground , " is a figure he used once to analyze and to rebuff the argument for all-out effort in civil defense that was so much in vogue in 1961 . To those in the military lobby who equated safety with all-out weapons production , he once pointed out that " The law of diminishing returns applies to strategic missiles as to all other commodities . " And to all the arguments of all the Dr. Strangeloves of all time he has returned what seems to me the definitive retort neat : " In great military matters , the confusions Tolstoi painted are a reality . " But if he knows the Russian novelists , Bundy does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-hour argument , " What ? We do not know yet if God exists and you want to eat ? " There is speed in everything Bundy does . His gestures , his gait , his speech all convey a sense of restless motion , verging on the impulsive . " I always have trouble explaining things to Mac , " a very old friend who is now a colleague in government said , " because he wants to get to the point before it can be fully exposed . " Perhaps nothing serves Bundy so well in his present job as the capacity to put in the quick fix . A good example occurred during President Kennedy 's European trip of June 1963 . In an impromptu talk delivered at the West Berlin City Hall , the President called on Berliners to " look to the advance of freedom . . . beyond the wall . " That phrase , evoking memories of John Foster Dulles and the liberation of Eastern Europe , seemed out of line with the plea for dealings with RusEk made by the President in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President spoke at the City Hall at I : 00 P.M. , and though the Presidential party then plunged into a ruund of luncheon festivities , Bundy was able to insert into the next Presidential address that day language that took the curse off the City Hall statement . Speaking two hours later at the Berlin Free University , the President said , " Justice requires us to do what we can ... to improve the lot and maintain the hopes of those on the other side . It is important that the people on the quiet streets in the East be kept in touch with Western society . " Aversion to Dogma , One reason Bundy is so swift is that his mental apparatus is unclogged by general ideas . On the contrary , like most people who concentrate on process , he is keenly sensitive to the contrasts between changing realities and fixed generalities , between practice and preaching . He is one of the authors of the speech delivered by President Kennedy at the 1962 Yale commencement that stressed the distinction between economic " myths " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1965 , he did not fail to point out that " today the country cheerfully and successfully practices the very doctrines of fiscal management which seemed outrageous to many in the mouth of our famous Harvard contemporary ? , " Though a deep-dyed Protestant , Bundy was almost alone in the Kennedy White House in arguing that the Catholics had a case for federal aid to parochial schools on the simple practical ground that these schools were an important part of the general educational system that needed to be improved ; he felt , in fact , that some of his Catholic colleagues on the Kennedy staff were " anticlerical . " As a Republican , and an administrator of the richest private educational institution in the world , Bundy was doubly allergic to federal control over education . But in a talk to college educators , entitled " Of Winds and Windmills , " he put the case for federal aid in a classic example of going beneath labels to practices . He pointed out that , on the whole , federal contributions served academic goals " better than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you know and as Don Quixote did not , " he said , " is a peaceful agency for making wind do work . The wind may blow from many directions but a well-designed windmill gets results in terms of grain ground . So it is with the well-designed university . " Connected with the distinction between myth and realities is a positive refusal to become entangled in dogma , an aversion to doctrine so strong that it amounts to ideological chastity . For Bundy to call an argu-112 ' tient " theological " is to him a reduetio ad absurdum . " If I can possibly help it , " one man who works frequently and successfully with Bundy says , " I never let him see how I would like a particular problem to come out . I just work on each part as it comes up . If he thought he knew what I wanted , my advice would be discounted . He would think that I was treating each separate matter not on the merits but in line with the goal I personally felt we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his sharpest criticism has been reserved for those who have gone overboard with their own ideas . William Buckley was an early target . In a review of God and Man , at Yale Bundy wrote : " I can imagine no more certain way of discrediting both religion and individualism than the acceptance of Mr. Buckley 's guidance . " In the Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard this year , he said of General MacArthur that " precisely because he overstated his case , and overasserted his power , there was a downgrading of what he believed in . " Similarly with Senator McCarthy : " By making charges so wild and loose that they failed in the end to command respect , by making a wild anticommunism an object of legitimate scorn , " Bundy said , " Senator McCarthy gravely impeded the continuing and accurate understanding of the reality of communism . " iron Knight of the Soft Line It is a mug 's game , in these circumstances , to try to label Bundy as a hawk or a dove or indeed to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only apt description I ever heard was marvelously complex : " The iron knight of the soft line . " In fact , as a manager of process , Bundy keeps his views in motion all the time . In the Cuban missiles crisis , for instance , he ended up in the camp of the hawks , favoring harsher methods than the blockade , but he began as the downiest of doves , favoring merely a diplomatic protest without any follow-up action to remove the missiles . This kind of adjustability is indeed the central motif of the Bundy career . It made it possible for him as a young man to help write the autobiography of a very old one WASHINGTON INSIGHT Henry L. Stimson 's On Active Service in Peace and War . It helps explain how a Yale man became the sparkplug of the postwar renaissance at Harvard . It enters into the circumstance that as a Republican he first found office under a Democratic President . It indicates how it was possible for him first to suggest that President Johnson pick Robert Kennedy as his running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy that he voluntarily withdraw his name from consideration . Now it has made it possible for him to be the only member of the original Kennedy White House staff to stay on with President Johnson at the White House for more than two years . A supreme mark of his unconcern with mere consistency is evident in two magazines dated July 3 of this year . One ( Saturday Review ) carried an article by Bundy which stressed " the three strands " that have been a " steady part of our policy . " The other ( The Harvard Alumni Bulletin ) reprinted a Phi Beta Kappa address by Bundy entitled " Four Strands of Reality . " Far , far more than woman 's name is frailty , in sum , Bundy 's name is flexibility . In a political atmosphere , where loyalty is a prime quality , expressed by advancing friends and baffling foes , Bundy 's flexibility is not always appreciated . Few people who have been elected to office in Washington trust him very far . " I know he did worlds for Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does worlds for Johnson . But he would have done the same for Joe Stalin too . " Still , if Bundy is not engrossed in the ordinary political loyalty , he has loyal-tea of another and not necessarily lower sort . He has institutional loyalties . Up from the Lowells Fur one thing , Bundy is a creature of the Establishment , in every sense of the word . Not only does he come from the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant gentry , nut only is he a direct descendant of the Lowells and other first families of the Colonies , but ? more important than either of these ? he stands in direct line of succession to what he once called " the large names in the American past ? the Roosevelts , Root , Stimson . " Bundy himself was Stimson 's partner in autobiography . His father , the late Harvey Hollister Bundy , was an aide to Stimson when he served Franklin Roosevelt as Secretary of War in World War II , and still earlier when Stimson was Secretary of State tinder Herbert Hoover . Stimson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his law partner , Elihu Root . And , Root , of course , was Secretary of War under T. R. himself . By American standards that is an apostolic laying on of hands , perhaps the closest thing we have to the great Villiers connection that led from Sir George Villiers through Marlborough , the Pitts , Fox , and Grey of Faliodon down to Winston Churchill , From these forebears , Bundy derives his style of life . He takes his ease at stately homes with old friends from good families . He belongs to the best , that is to say the most exclusive , clubs . He believes in what T. R. called the " strenuous life , " and shows it in a fierce game of tennis . A genteel prig he is not ? if only because of a fine taste for malice and a somewhat forced , giddy gaiety , most noticeable in uproarious tote-d-totes with Washington 's most elegant hostesses . Wittingly or not , he conveys to many a sense of self-satisfied superiority . One of the fairest and most widely respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News , once wrote of Bundy that " he may love his family , but he tends to look down his nose at mere mortals . " Tradition is an important reality to him . Unlike his older brother , Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy , who moved to Washington , married a local girl ( Mary Acheson , the daughter of the former Secretary of State ) , and became a Democrat , a bureaucrat , and a booster of a local private school , McGeorge Bundy stayed Republican , settled in Cambridge , and married a proper Bostonian ( Mary Lothrop ) . One of his four sons has already started the family parade through Groton ; in the Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard this year he made a point of telling his listeners " to hold to one another across the generations . " Like most of the statesmen of yore , he has about him a certain yravitas , expressed in an eye of steely glint , a jaw that juts aggressively in debate , and a taste for old-fashioned circumlocutions that ale /night ascribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting over %ening at The Club . Probably only Bundy among moderns could speak lof the need to arrange international cocoa ' coffee% and wheat agreements tt , i writing : " We must and do recog-oio that what happens to certain great commodities that make break- ; - i fast for the world is more significant ' for many a young economy than all the long-term loans that Washington can laboriously assemble . " " Power " or " Service ? " The Establishment impact on Bundy is by no means confined merely to belles lettres . It extends to matters of policy and of personnel . Far more than most people in government , Bundy is concerned that the men of rivilege understand , approve , and rry out American policies . Whener important roles are entrusted to 816 well-known figures as John Mc-Cloy or Arthur Dean or Eugene Black or General Lucius Clay , the odds are good that Bundy had a hand in the choice . His central approach to foreign affairs , moreover , is in perfect keeping with the basic precepts of Theodore Roosevelt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is inescapably part of the rest of the world . As he put it in the Phi Beta Kappa oration , " None of us gazing on the world as it really i5 has been able to escape from the fact that we are what is called a Great Power , a great power engaged . A great power whose inaction is as important in the affairs of the world as its action . " Bundy equally tends to stress what P. R. called " the big stick . " In the introduction to The Pattern of Reeponsibility , a book of former Secretary of State Acheson 's collected Papers edited by Bundy in 1952 , he wrote : " Very near the heart of all reign affairs is the relationship between policy and military power . " In the book he wrote with Stimson he was party to ? if not , as the style sug-1.08ts , sole author of ? a justification Or using atomic weapons against Japan that seems militant in its con-lident- certitude . " In war , as in a boxirig the book says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to moderate his blows whenever the oPponent shows signs of weaken-ing . . . . It was not the American responsibility to throw in the sponge for the Japanese . " But along with a certain harshness , Bundy has retained from his spiritual ancestors an outlook characteristic of the good families who , when they found themselves outreached in the race for wealth during the post-Civil War period , turned to government as a means of regaining power and prestige . What most of his contemporaries think of as being posts of power and privilege , bearing with them the chance to push other people around , come out in Bundy 's mouth as obligations , duties , and tests . " Service , " apart from figuring in the title of his Stimson book , is a word still often on Bundy 's lips . In an essay he wrote for the quarterly Foreign Affairs during a time of inner stress ? in early 1964 , while deciding to stay on with President Johnson ? he spoke of the " enforced familiarity of close experience with the Presidential task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " of the President as a " servant of peace . " He ended with the conclusion that " loyalty to President Kennedy and loyalty to President Johnson are not merely naturally compatible , but logically necessary . " Still later , in the Saturday Review article , he was to carry his love affair with the Presidency to empyrean heights by writing : " Whether the accents and actions of an Administration are those of Hyde Park , or of Independence , or of Abilene and the Army , or of Hyannis and Harvard ? or the complex and wonderful set of actions and accents which I have the honor to serve that word again today ? they flow in a single stream . " If that sounds like mere piety , it is also an expression of , and an introduction to , another Bundy loyalty . For there is far more to the public service these days , and especially to serving a President in the foreign field , than is dreamed of in the philosophy of the gentlemen of the old school . To do service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , morally and in pedigree , a cut above " malefactors of great wealth . " To get a good grasp on any modern problem , to discover the pattern from which there may be deduced the path of responsibility , requires penetrating analysis ? the special gift of that bizarre creature , the modern intelEver Think of Yourself As a Product ? THE student might be considered the product of an educational factory . A product of thousands of painstaking learning operations contributing to educational growth , to the making of the product , the student . The analogy goes far enough when it is understood that , like all products , the student must eventually be sold . He must sell himself to businessmen for the job wanted , to educators for graduate work and fellowship opportunities . . . . ? Advertisement for Eaton 's Hi-Line report covers lectual . Despite intense differences of background and outlook , Bundy as much as anybody else in Washington has sought out intellectuals , brought them into the government , and sustained them close to the center of power . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sweden , ever did so much for the philosopher . In a sense the Bundy staff is a think-tank ? a collection of intellectuals strategically located to apply the most rigorous criticism and the most advanced thinking to American foreign policy . Its membership is exceedingly diverse in matters of race , background , and professional expertise . The one kind of person Bundy has not put on his staff is a member or even a candidate member of the Establishment . The influence of the staff , even more than Bundy 's influence and for the same reasons , tends to be hidden . But to me anyhow , the thrust of the staff is well-represented by the known public actions of two men who have moved on to more visible jobs . There is Ralph Dungan , now Ambassador to Chile . Dungan has at all times been concerned to promote harmonious relations between the United States and the neutralist and underdeveloped countries of Asia , Africa , and Latin America . And there is Carl Kaysen , Bundy 's former deputy , now a professor of economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading proponent of arms control ; he was a key member , perhaps the key member , of the Harriman mission that negotiated the test-ban treaty with Russia in the summer of 1963 . If these samples say anything , they say that connections with the intellectuals are countervailing pressures to connections with the Establishment . And these pressures also find expression in Bundy 's public talk . Almost as much as he emphasizes the great power role of the United States , Bundy stresses the peaceful intent of this country . The Foreign Affairs article that reflected his decision to stay with President Johnson was entitled " The Presidency and the Peace . " " The American Presidency , " Bundy wrote , " has now become the world 's best hope for preventing the unexampled catastrophe of nuclear war . " Similarly , Bundy has consistently stressed the need for this country to achieve and maintain , not imperial relations with other countries , but rapport . As early as 1952 Bundy was using in a Foreign Affairs article a phrase that John Foster Dulles was to cite when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action against Suez . According to Bundy , the United States had to act " with a decent respect to the opinions of others , and with an understanding of the importance of independent friends . " By 1962 , in another Foreign Affairs article entitled " Friends and Allies , " he was writing that between them and us " the central problem is to establish reciprocity . " And this year , in his Saturday Review article , he was saying about outlanders things lyrical enough to make even Chester Bowles blush . " The dreams of others must have room to come true , " Bundy wrote , " and .. . American power must be responsive to that end . " That Bundy 's loyalties should run . to groups ( the Establishment and the Intellectuals ) that negate each other may seem logically contradictory . But psychologically it is in harmony . It only reinforces the proposition that Bundy is a process man . He stands exposed to a marvelously full range of opinion , and can move , or open the door for a President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Able to work within any frame of reference , he commands all the tools to keep the game going , is almost always in position to right a balance gone wrong . Truly to play that role is to be the ideal man of the Greeks ? the Man of the Golden Mean . And it is not i ? eay hard to find places where Bundy hail strayed from the mean . There is the familiar and not very serious charge that he is prone to harsh judgments of intellectual inferiors . A connected criticism is that he allows his ego to become deeply engaged in policy de , bates ? a criticism sustained , I believe , in his debate on Vietnam with pre . fessor Hans Morgenthau , indeed even in his willingness to debate publicly a person so little instructed on 80 complex an issue . It may also be said that Bundy generally goes for the policy that is expedient for Bun , dy and that he indulges himself in the luxury of appearing to be more committed to hard lines than he at . tually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that the masking of his true opinions is not merely a case of the " passion for anonymity " supposedly appropriate to Presidential advisers , but native instinct . One former colleague and admirer once said of him , " Mac is exceedingly complex . You do n't know what he thinks . I do n't know what he thinks . The President does n't know what he thinks . And I sometimes wonder whether he knows what he thinks . " Reading the Riddle But it is not on that note that I want to end either what I have to say about Bundy , or what happens to be my regular association with this magazine as its Washington Correspondent . The central fact , what I most want to say , is that Bundy is the leading candidate , perhaps the only candidate , for the statesman 's mantle to emerge in the generation that is coming to power ? the generation that reached maturity in the war and postwar period . His capacity to read the riddle of multiple confusions , to consider a wide variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and execute public Purposes , to impart quickened energies to men of the highest ability seems to me unmatched . To me , anyhow , he seems almost alone among contemPo raries a figure of true consequence , a fit subject for Milton 's words : A Pillar of State ; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and publick care ; And Princely counsel in his face .
