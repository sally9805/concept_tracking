THE SIEGE OF HARLEM by Warren Miller . 166 pages . McGraw-Hill. $3.95 . <P> Harlem has seceded and declared itself a nation . Barricades made of abandoned autos , Fifth Avenue buses and Con Edison signs ( " Dig We Must " ) have been erected on its borders . Frontier guards have been posted on the subway lines and the New York Central and New Haven railroads , and tolls are collected as the trains pass through Harlem . The " numbers " have been nationalized . Harlem 's Congressman Lance Huggins , the first Prime Minister , announces a policy of no-surrender : " We have surrendered absolutely to our fate which is freedom . We had this secret space in us and now we have located it geographically and made it public for all the world to see . " <P> Too topical to be funny ? In spite of the current Harlem rioting , Warren Miller , one of the best satirists ( Looking for the General ) writing in the U.S. , has brought the joke off . In this novel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks , whites , and the whole racial fuss ; yet beneath the hilarity is a clear warning : " Laugh at your peril . It could happen . " Writing such a seriocomic novel is a feat of literary acrobatics , but Miller does not lose his balance . <P> The story is narrated , Uncle Remus style , 75 years " later when Harlem is an old and established nation like Nigeria and Ghana . The narrator was a Harlem militiaman in the days of derring-do , but now he is full of " Well , honey 's " and " byembys . " The children at his knee are snotty little know-it-alls with African nationalist names : Jomo , Sekou , Mboya . But " Grandpa " fascinates them with stories of how Harlemites resisted all threats and blandishments , how they were impervious even to Radio Free Harlem , over which " Washington , D.C. , Rose " seductively urged them to return to the comforts , clean suits and warm apartments of the Privileged People . Harlem 's early heroes were the sit-in veterans like Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay-down , and stall-in with the best of them . When it came to a non-violent charge into some governor 's office , he led the way . He once out-pacified a Long Island high school principal , single-handed . " <P> Miller , a white man who lived in Harlem for five years , has mastered the vernacular , which in its own way is as eccentric as Uncle Remus ' . He has also distinguished the different Harlem personality types-his way of saying that Negroes are people , too . And he has managed to show that even the nation 's No. 1 problem is good for an occasional laugh .
