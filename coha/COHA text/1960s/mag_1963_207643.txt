War breaks out in September 1966 . " Red " forces attack the " violet " ( NATO ) alliance , only to be stymied at the Rhine . The reds try an end run through " white " country ( Switzerland ) to invade " blue " country France . <P> So went the script for the French army 's annual fall war games . The setting was lovely : the meadows and fir-covered hills of the Jura mountains , a few miles from the Swiss border . The assemblage was splendid : Charles de Gaulle in his brigadier general 's uniform ; Premier Georges Pompidou ; General Charles Ailleret , the modern-minded chief of staff of all French forces ; General Louis Le Puloch , the traditionalist chief of staff . <P> To block the flanking thrust , the army men staging the games plotted military academy textbook tactics-with nuclear trimmings . The invading reds began the show by firing nuclear artillery at the blue defenders , supposedly vaporizing the town of Pon-tarlier ( pop . 16,000 ) . Smoke machines puffed up mushroom clouds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of Mirage VIs to drop 60-kiloton bombs on a red town of equivalent size . Meanwhile , back at the battlefield , the blues sprayed 15 tactical nuclear weapons on the reds in an area ten miles long and ten miles wide . More puffs of smoke aux champignons . Fifteen minutes passed , and the blues advanced in tanks and on foot . France won . Among army strategists , felicitations all around . <P> <P> De Gaulle 's nuclear experts and modern warfare men , however , were appalled . They insist that France 's nuclear force will be only a deterrent , or else a last-gasp weapon ; if they fail to deter , and France is falling , then and only then are the bombers to be used to drag the attacker under with France . They can not be used on routine , tit-for-tat bombing missions as the war games suggested . As for the frantic , 15-weapon battlefield broadside , so lavish a use of atomic weapons in so small an area ( particularly on French soil ) amounted to nothing more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move into the area 15 minutes later ? What would be left to attack ? How could one protect tanks and infantry against fire and intense radioactivity ? <P> De Gaulle himself tried to calm the briefing rooms by admitting that France is still at the " stumbling stage of nuclear tactics . " Some mistakes had been shown up usefully , he comforted ; future maneuvers would not resemble this one at all .
