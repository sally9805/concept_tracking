txt // manifested ; but it is not possible to get rid of them . The belief that faulty character can so organize itself socially , as to get out of itself a conduct which is not proportionately faulty , is an utterly-baseless belief . You may alter the incidence of the mischief , but the amount of it must inevitably be borne somewhere . Very generally it is simply thrust out of one form into another ; as when , in Austria , improvident marriages being prevented , there come more numerous illegitimate children ; or as when , to mitigate the misery of foundlings , hospitals are provided for them , and there is an increase in the number of infants abandoned ; or as when , to insure the stability of houses , a Building Act prescribes a structure which , making small houses unremunerative , prevents due multiplication of them , and so causes overcrowding ; or as when a Lodging-House Act forbids this overcrowding , and vagrants have to sleep under the Adelplii-arches , or in the Parks , or even , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the evil does not , as in cases like these , reappear in another place or form , it is necessarily felt in the shape of a diffused privation . For suppose that by some official instrumentality you actually suppress an evil , instead of thrusting it from one spot into another ? suppose you thus successfully deal with a number of such evils by a number of such instrumentalities ; do you think these evils have disappeared absolutely ? To see that they have not , you have but to ask ? Whence comes the official apparatus ? What defrays the cost of working it ? Who supplies the necessaries of life to its members through all their gradations of rank ? There is no other source but the labour of peasants and artizans . When , as in France , the administrative agencies occupy some 600,000 men , who are taken from industrial pursuits , and , with their families , supported in more than average comfort , it becomes clear enough that heavy extra work is entailed on the producing classes . The already-tired labourer has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fields as well as to suckle her infant ; his children are still more scantily fed than they would otherwise be ; and beyond a decreased share of returns from increased labour , there is a diminished time and energy for such small enjoyments as the life , pitiable at the best , permits . How , then , can it be supposed that the evils // have been extinguished or escaped ? The repressive action has had its corresponding reaction ; and instead of intenser miseries here and there , or now and then , you have got a misery that is constant and universal . When it is thus seen that the evils are not removed , but at best only re-distributed , and that the question in any case is whether re-distribution , even if practicable , is desirable ; it will be seen that the " must-do-something " plea is quite insufficient . There is ample reason to believe that in proportion as scientific men carry into this most-involved class of phenomena , the methods they have successfully adopted with other classes , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other classes , are conclusions to be drawn and action to be taken without prolonged and critical investigation . Still there will recur the same plea under other forms . " Political conduct must be matter of compromise . " " We must adapt our measures to immediate exigencies , and can not be deterred by remote considerations . " " The data for forming scientific judgments are not to be had : most of them are unrecorded , and those which are recorded are difficult to find as well as doubtful when found . " " Life is too short , and the demands upon our energies too great , to permit any such elaborate study as seems required . We must , therefore , guide ourselves by common sense as best we may . " And then , behind the more scientifically-minded who give this answer , there are those who hold , tacitly or overtly , that guidance of the kind indicated is not possible , even after any amount of inquiry . They do not believe in any ascertainable order among social phenomena ? there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will discuss in the next chapter . CHAPTER II . IS THERE A SOCIAL SCIENCE ? ALMOST every autumn may be heard the remark that a hard winter is coming , for that the hips and haws are abundant : the implied belief being that God , intending to send much frost and snow , has provided a large store of food for the birds . Interpretations of this kind , tacit or avowed , prevail widely . Not many weeks since , one who had received the usual amount of culture said in my hearing , that the swarm of lady-birds which overspread the country some summers ago , had been providentially designed to save the crop of hops from the destroying aphides . Of course this theory of the divine government , here applied to occurrences bearing but indirectly , if at all , on human welfare , is applied with still greater confidence to occurrences that directly affect us , individually and socially . It is a theory carried out with logical consistency by the Methodist who , before going on a journey or removing to another house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye rests upon , finds an intimation of approval or disapproval from heaven . And in its political applications it yields such appropriate beliefs as that the welfare of England in comparison with Continental States , has been a reward for better observance of the Sunday , or that an invasion of cholera was consequent on the omission of Dei gratia from an issue of coins . The interpretation of historical events in general after this same method , accompanies such interpretations of ordinary passing events ; and , indeed , outlives them . Those to whom the natural genesis of simpler phenomena has been made manifest by increasing knowledge , still believe in the supernatural genesis of phenomena that are very much involved , 22 // and can not have their causes readily traced . The form of mind which , in an official despatch , prompts the statement that " it has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe to the British arms the most successful issue to the extensive combinations rendered necessary for the purpose of effecting the passage of the Chenaub , " ' is a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere sees interpositions of the Deity to bring about results that appear to the interpreter the most desirable . Thus , for example , Mr. Schomberg writes : " It seemed good to the All-beneficent Disposer of human events , to overrule every obstacle ; and through His instrument , William of Normandy , to expurgate the evils of the land ; and to resuscitate its dying powers . " 2 And elsewhere : ? " The time had now arrived when the Almighty Governor , after having severely punished the whole nation , was intending to raise its drooping head ? to give a more rapid impulse to its prosperity , and to cause it to stand forth more prominently as an EXEMPLAR STATE . For this end , Ile raised up an individual eminently fitted for the intended work " Henry VII . . ' And again : " As if to mark this epoch of history with greater distinctness , it was closed by the death of George III. , the GREAT and the Goon , who had been raised up as the grand instrument of its accomplishment. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained by a French writer who , like the English writer just quoted , professes to have looked behind the veil of things ; and who tells us what have been the intentions of God in chastising his chosen people , the French . For it is to be observed in passing that , just as the evangelicals among ourselves think we are divinely blessed because we have preserved the purity of the faith , so it is obvious to the author of La Main de l'Homme et le Doigt de Dieu , as to other Frenchmen , that France is hereafter still to be , as it has hitherto been , the leader of the world . This writer , in chapters entitled " Causes providentielles de nos malheurs , " " Les Prussiens et les fleaux de Dieu , " and " Justification de la Providence , " carries out his interpretations in ways we need not here follow , and then closes his " Epilogue " with these sentences // Conceptions of this kind are not limited to historians whose names have dropped out of remembrance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going on , play the part of a Greek chorus , telling the world of spec-tators what has been the divine purpose and what are the di-vine intentions ; but we have lately had a Professor of History setting forth conceptions essentially identical in nature . Here are his words " And now , gentlemen , was this vast campaign of Teutons against Romans fought without a general I If Trafalgar could not be won without the mind of a Nelson , or Waterloo without the mind of a Wellington , was there no one mind to lead those innumerable armies on whose success depended the future of the whole human race f Did no one marshal them in that impregnable convex front , from the Euxine to the North Seal No one guide them to the two great strategic centres of the Black Forest and Trieste I No one cause them , blind barbarians without maps or science , to follow those rules of war without which victory in a protracted struggle is impossible ; I // and by the pressure of the Huns behind , force on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first beyond the powers of mortal men I Believe it who will : but I cannot. 1 may be told that they gravitated into their places , as stones and mud do Be it so . They obeyed natural laws of course , as all things do on earth , when they obeyed the laws of war : those , too , are natural laws , explicable on simple mathematical principles . But while I believe that not a stone or a handful of mud gravitates into its place without the will of God ; that it was ordained , ages since , into what particular spot each grain of gold should be washed down from an Australian quartz reef , that a certain man might find it at a certain moment and crisis of his life ; ? if I be superstitious enough ( as , thank God , I am ) to hold that creed , shall I not believe that , though this great war had no general upon earth , it may have had a general in heaven I and that , in spite of all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts of God . " 6 It does not concern us here to seek a reconciliation of the incongruous ideas bracketed together in this paragraph ? to ask how the results of gravitation , which acts with such uniformity that under given conditions its effect is calculable with certainty , can at the same time be regarded as the results of will , which we class apart because , as known by our experience , it is comparatively irregular ; or to ask how , if the course of human affairs is divinely pre-determined just as material changes are , any distinction is to be drawn between that prevision of material changes which constitutes physical science and historical prevision : the reader may be left to evolve the obvious conclusion that either the current idea of physical causation has to be abandoned , or the current idea of will has to be abandoned . All which I need call attention to as indicating the general character of such interpretations , is the remarkable title of the chapter containing this passage ? " The Strategy of Providence . " In common with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks to those who use such names for its Cause as " The Master Builder , " or " The Great Artificer ; " and who seem to think that the Cause of the Universe is made more marvellous by comparing its operations to those of a skilled mechanic . But really the expression , " Strategy of Providence , " reveals a conception of this Cause which is in some respects more puzzling . Such a title as " The Great Artificer , " // while suggesting simply the process of shaping a pre-existing material , and leaving the question whence this material came untouched , may at any rate be said not to negative the assumption that the material is created by " The Great Artificer " who shapes it . The phrase , " Strategy of Providence , " however , necessarily implies difficulties to be overcome . The Divine Strategist must have a skilful antagonist to make strategy possible . So that we are inevitably introduced to the conception of a Cause of the Universe continually impeded by some independent cause which has to be out-generalled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief , the implication of which is that God is obliged to overcome opposition by subtle devices . The disguises which piety puts on are , indeed , not unfrequently suggestive of that which some would describe by a quite opposite name . To study the Universe as it is manifested to us ; to ascertain by patient observation the order of the manifestations ; to discover that the manifestations are connected with one another after a regular way in Time and Space ; and , after repeated failures , to give up as futile the attempt to understand the Power manifested ; is condemned as irreligious . And meanwhile the character of religious is claimed by those who figure to themselves a Creator moved by motives like their own ; who conceive themselves as discovering his designs ; and who even speak of him as though he laid plans to outwit the Devil ! This , however , by the way . The foregoing extracts and comments are intended to indicate the mental attitude of those for whom there can be no such thing as Sociology , properly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied alike by the " D.V. " of a missionary-meeting placard and by the phrases of Emperor William 's late despatches , where thanks to God come next to enumerations of the thousands slain , is one to which the idea of a Social Science is entirely alien , and indeed repugnant . An allied class , equally unprepared to interpret sociological phenomena scientifically , is the class which sees in the course of civilization little else than a record of remarkable persons and their doings . One who is conspicuous as the exIS // ponent of this view writes : ? " As I take it , universal history , the history of what man has accomplished in this world , is at bottom the history of the great men who have worked here . " And this , not perhaps distinctly formulated , but everywhere implied , is the belief in which nearly all are brought up . Let us glance at the genesis of it . Round their camp-fire assembled savages tell the events of the day 's chase ; and he among them who has done some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return from the warpath , the sagacity of the chief and the strength or courage of this or that warrior , are the all-absorbing themes . When the day , or the immediate past , affords no remarkable deed , the topic is the achievement of some noted leader lately dead , or some traditional founder of the tribe : accompanied , it may be , with a dance dramatically representing those victories which the chant recites . Such narratives , concerning , as they do , the prosperity and indeed the very existence of the tribe , are of the intensest interest ; and in them we have the common root of music , of the drama , of poetry , of biography , of history , and of literature in general . Savage life furnishes little else worthy of note ; and the chronicles of tribes contain scarcely anything more to be remembered . Early historic races show us the same thing . The Egyptian frescoes and the wall-sculptures of the Assyrians , represent the deeds of leading men ; and inscriptions such as that on the Moabite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by implication do these records , pictorial , hieroglyphic , or written , convey anything else . And similarly from the Greek epics , though we gather incidentally that there were towns , and war-vessels , and war-chariots , and sailors , and soldiers to be led and slain , yet the direct intention is to set forth the triumphs of Achilles , the prowess of Ajax , the wisdom of Ulysses , and the like . The lessons given to every civilized child tacitly imply , like the traditions ' of the uncivilized and semi-civilized , that throughout the past of the human race , the doings of conspicuous persons have been the only things worthy of remembrance . How Abraham girded up his loins and gat him to this place or that ; how Samuel conveyed divine injunctions which Saul disobeyed ; how David recounted his adventures as a shepherd , and was reproached for // his misdeeds as a king ? these , and personalities akin to these , are the facts about which the juvenile reader of the Bible is interested and respecting which he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into the narrative , being regarded neither by him nor by his teacher as of moment . So too , when , with hands behind him , he stands to say his lesson out of Pinnock , we see that the things set down for him to learn , are ? when and by whom England was invaded , what rulers opposed the invasions and how they were killed , what Alfred did and what Canute said , who fought at Agincourt and who conquered at Flodden , which king abdicated and which usurped , &c.; ; and if by some chance it comes out that there were serfs in those days , that barons were local rulers , some vassals of others , that subordination of them to a central power took place gradually , these are facts treated as relatively unimportant . Nay , the like happens when the boy passes into the hands of his classical master , at home or elsewhere . " Arms and the man " form the end of the story as they form its beginning . After the mythology , which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers from Agamemnon down to Ciesar : what knowledge is gained of Social organization , manners , ideas , morals , being little more than the biographical statements involve . And the value of the knowledge is so ranked that while it would be a disgrace to be wrong about the amours of Zeus , and while inability to name the commander at Marathon would be discreditable , it is excusable to know nothing of the social condition that preceded Lycurgus or of the origin and functions of the Areopagus . Thus the great-man-theory of History finds everywhere a ready-prepared conception ? is , indeed , but the definite expression of that which is latent in the thoughts of the savage , tacitly asserted in all early traditions , and taught to every child by multitudinous illustrations . The glad acceptance it meets with has sundry more special causes . There is , first , this universal love of personalities , which , active in the aboriginal man , dominates still ? a love seen in the urchin who asks you to tell him a story , meaning , thereby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police-reports , court-news , divorce-cases , accounts of accidents and lists of // births , marriages , and deaths ; a love displayed even by conversations in the streets , where fragments of dialogue , heard in passing , show that mostly between men , and always between women , the personal pronouns recur every instant . If you want roughly to estimate any one 's mental calibre , you can not do it better than by observing a ratio of generalities to personalities in his talk ? how far simple truths about individuals are replaced by truths abstracted from numerous experiences of men and things . And when you have thus measured many , you find but a scattered few likely to take anything more than a biographical view of human affairs . In the second place , this great-man-theory commends itself as promising instruction along with amusement . Being already fond of hearing about people 's sayings and doings , it is pleasant news that , to understand the course of civilization , you have only to read diligently the lives of distinguished men . What can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct not very remotely allied to that of the village gossip ? while you are receiving through print instead of orally , remarkable facts concerning notable persons , you are gaining that knowledge which will make clear to you why things have happened thus or thus in the world , and will prepare you for forming a right opinion on each question coming before you as a citizen . And then , in the third place , the interpretation of things thus given is so beautifully simple ? seems so easy to comprehend . Providing you are content with conceptions that are out of focus , as most people 's conceptions are , the solutions it yields appear quite satisfactory . Just as that tl ieory of the Solar System which supposes the planets to have been launched into their orbits by the hand of the Almighty , looks feasible so long as you do not insist on knowing exactly what is meant by the hand of the Almighty ; and just as the special creation of plants and animals seems a tenable hypothesis until you try and picture to yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into existence ; so the genesis of societies by the actions of great men , may be comfortably believed so long as , resting in general notions , you do not ask for particulars . But now , if , dissatisfied with vagueness , we demand that our ideas shall be brought into focus and exactly defined , we // discover the hypothesis to be utterly incoherent . If , not stopping at the explanation of social progress as due to the great man , we go back a step and ask whence comes the great man , we find that the theory breaks down completely . The question has two conceivable answers : his origin is supernatural , or it is natural . Is his origin supernatural ? Then he is a deputy-god , and we have Theocracy once removed ? or , rather , not removed at all ; for we must then agree with Mr. Schomberg , quoted above , that " the determination of Grsar to invade Britain " was divinely inspired , and that from him , down to " George III . the GREAT and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out successive designs . Is this an unacceptable solution ? Then the origin of the great man is natural ; and immediately this is recognized he must be classed with all other phenomena in the society that gave him birth , as a product of its antecedents . Along with the whole generation of which he forms a minute part ? along with its institutions , language , knowledge , manners , and its multitudinous arts and appliances , he is a resultant of an enormous aggregate of forces that have been co-operating for ages . True , if you please to ignore all that common observation , verified by physiology , teaches ? if you assume that two European parents may produce a Negro child , or that from woolly-haired prognathous Papuans may come a fair , straighthaired infant of Caucasian type ? you may assume that the advent of the great man can occur anywhere and under any conditions . If , disregarding those accumulated results of experience which current proverbs and the generalizations of psychologists alike express , you suppose that a Newton might be born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Andamanese , that a Howard or a Clarkson might have Fiji parents , then you may proceed with facility to explain social progress as caused by the actions of the great man . But if all biological science , enforcing all popular belief , convinces you that by no possibility will an Aristotle come from a father and mother with facial angles of fifty degrees , and that out of a tribe of cannibals , whose chorus in preparation for a feast of human flesh is a kind of rhythmical roaring , there is not the remotest chance of a Beethoven arising ; then you must admit that the genesis of the great man // depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears , and the social state into which that race has slowly grown . If it be a fact that the great man may modify his nation in its structure and actions , it is also a fact that there must have been those antecedent modifications constituting national progress before he could be evolved . Before he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that all those changes of which he is the proximate initiator have their chief causes in the generations he descended from . If there is to be anything like a real explanation of these changes , it must be sought in that aggregate of conditions out of which both he and they have arisen . Even were we to grant the absurd supposition that the genesis of the great man does not depend on the antecedents furnished by the society he is born in , there would still be the quite-sufficient facts that he is powerless in the absence of the material and mental accumulations which his society inherits from the past , and that he is powerless in the absence of the co-existing population , character , intelligence , and social arrangements . Given a Shakspeare , and what dramas could he have written without the multitudinous traditions of civilized life ? without the various experiences which , descending to him from the past , gave wealth to his thought , and without the language which a hundred generations had developed and enriched by use ? Suppose a Watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe ignorant of iron , or in a tribe that could get only as much iron as a fire blown by hand-bellows will smelt ; or suppose him born among ourselves before lathes existed ; what chance would there have been of the steam-engine ? Imagine a Laplace unaided by that slowlydeveloped system of Mathematics which we trace back to its beginnings among the Egyptians ; how far would he have got with the Dlecanigooc Celeste : ? Nay , the like questions may be put and have like answers , even if we limit ourselves to those classes of great men on whose doings hero-worshippers more particularly dwell ? the rulers and generals . Xenophon could not have achieved his celebrated feat had his Ten Thousand been feeble , or cowardly , or insubordinate . Caesar would never have made his conquests without disciplined troops , in32 TILE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY . heriting their prestige and tactics and organization from the Romans who lived before them . And , to take a recent instance , the strategical genius of Moltke would have triumphed in no great campaigns had there not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had not those soldiers been men of strong bodies , sturdy characters , obedient natures , and capable of carrying out orders intelligently . W ere any one to marvel over the potency of a grain of detonating powder , which explodes a cannon , propels the shell , and sinks a vessel hit  --  were he to enlarge on the transcendent virtues of this detonating powder , not mentioning the ignited charge , the shell , the cannon , and all that enormous aggregate of appliances by which these have severally been produced , detonating powder included ; we should not regard his interpretation as very rational . But it would fairly compare in rationality with this interpretation of social phenomena which , dwelling on the important changes the great man works , ignores that vast pre-existing supply of latent power he unlocks , and that immeasurable accumulation of antecedents to which both he and this power are due . Recognizing what truth there is in the great-man-theory , we may say that , if limited to early societies , the histories of which are little else than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses the fact in representing the capable leader as all-important ; though even here it leaves out of sight too much the number and the quality of his followers . But its immense error lies in the assumption that what was once true is true for ever ; and that a relation of ruler and ruled which was possible and good at one time is possible and good for all time . Just as fast as this predatory activity of early tribes diminishes , just as fast as larger aggregates are formed by conquest or otherwise , just as fast as war ceases to be the business of the whole male population , so fast do societies begin to develop , to show traces of structures and functions not before possible , to acquire increasing complexity along with increasing size , to give origin to new institutions , new activities , new ideas , sentiments , and habits ; all of which unobtrusively make their appearance without the thought of any king or legislator . And if you wish to understand these // phenomena of social evolution , you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographies of all the great rulers on record , down to Frederick the Greedy and Napoleon the Treacherous . In addition to that passive denial of a Social Science iniplied by these two allied doctrines , one or other of which is held by nine men out of ten , there comes from some an active denial of it ? either entire or partial . Reasons are given for the belief that no such thing is possible . The invalidity of these reasons can be shown only after the essential nature of Social Science , overlooked by those who give them , has been pointed out ; and to point this out here would be to forestal the argument . Some minor criticisms may , however , fitly precede the major criticism . Let us consider first the positions taken up by Mr. Fronde : " When natural causes are liable to be set aside and neutralized by what is called volition , the word Science is out of place . If it is free to a man to choose what he will do or not do , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , there is no free choice , and the praise or blame with which we regard one another are impertinent and out of place . " ' " It is in this marvellous power in men to do wrong . . . that the impossibility stands of forming scientific calculations of what men will do before the fact , or scientific explanations of what they have done after the fact . " 8 " Mr. Buckle would deliver himself from the eccentricities of this and that individual by a doctrine of averages . . . . Unfortunately the average of one generation need not be the average of the next : . . . no two generations are alike . " 9 " There in history the phenomena never repeat themselves . There we are dependent wholly on the record of things said to have happened once , but which never happen or can happen a second time . There no experiment is possible ; we can watch for no recurring fact to test the worth of our conjectures . " 10 Here Mr. Froude changes the venue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus necessity : declaring a Social Science to be incompatible with free will . The first extract implies , not simply that individual volition is incalculable  --  that " there is no adequate science of " man ( no Science of Psychology ) ; but it also asserts , by implication , that // there are no causal relations among his states of mind : the volition by which " natural causes are liable to be set aside , " being put in antithesis to natural , must be supernatural . Hence we are , in fact , carried back to that primitive form of interpretation contemplated at the outset . A further comment is , that because volitions of some kinds can not be foreseen , Mr. Froude argues as though no volitions can be foreseen : ignoring the fact that the simple volitions determining ordinary conduct , are so regular that prevision having a high degree of probability is easy . If , in crossing a street , a man sees a carriage coming upon him , you may safely assert that , in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way . If , being pressed to catch a train , he knows that by one route it is a mile to the station and by another two miles , you may conclude with considerable confidence that he will take the one-mile route ; and should he be aware that losing the train will lose him a fortune , it is pretty certain that , if he has but ten minutes to do the mile in , he will either run or call a cab . If he can buy next door a commodity of daily consumption better and cheaper than at the other end of the town , we may affirm that , if he does not buy next door , some special relation between him and the remoter shop-keeper furnishes a strong reason for taking a worse commodity at greater cost of money and trouble . And though , if he has an estate to dispose of , it is within the limits of possibility that he will sell it to A for ? 1,000 , though B has offered ? 2,000 for it ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken into account as qualifying the generalization that a man will sell to the highest bidder . Now , since the predominant activities of citizens are determined by motives of this degree of regularity , there must be resulting social phenomena that have corresponding degrees of regularity ? greater degrees , indeed , since in them the effects of exceptional motives become lost in the effects of the aggregate of ordinary motives . Another comment may be added . Mr. Froude exaggerates the antithesis he draws by using a conception of science which is too narrow : he speaks as though there were no science but exact science . Scientific previsions , both qualitative and quantitative , have various degrees of definiteness ; and because among // certain classes of phenomena the previsions are approximate only , it is not , therefore , to be said that there is no science of those phenomena : if there is some prevision , there is some science . Take , for example , Meteorology . The Derby has been run in a snow-storm , and you may occasionally want a fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being perfectly certain that the coming summer will be warmer than the past winter . Our south-westerly gales in the autumn may come early or may come late , may be violent or moderate , at one time or at intervals ; but that there will be an excess of wind from the south-west at that part of the year we may be sure . The like holds with the relations of rain and dry weather to the quantity of water in the air and the weight of the atmospheric column : though exactly-true predictions can not be made , approximately-true ones can . So that , even were there not among social phenomena more definite relations than these ( and the all-important ones are far more definite ) , there would still be a Social Science . Once more , Mr. Froude contends that the facts presented in history do not furnish subjectmatter for science , because they " never repeat themselves , " ? because " we can watch for no recurring fact to test the worth of our conjectures . " I will not meet this assertion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves ; but , admitting that Mr. Fronde here touches on one of the great difficulties of the Social Science ( that social phenomena are in so considerable a degree different in each case from what they were in preceding cases ) , I still find a sufficient reply . For in no concrete science is there absolute repetition ; and in some concrete sciences the repetition is no more specific than in Sociology . Even in the most exact of them , Astronomy , the combinations are never the same twice over ; the repetitions are but approximate . And on turning to Geology , we find that , though the processes of denudation , deposition , upheaval , subsidence , have been ever going on in conformity with laws more or less clearly generalized , the effects have been always new in their proportions and arrangements ; though not so completely new as to forbid comparisons , consequent deductions , and approximate previsions based on them . Were there no such replies as these to Mr. Froude 's rea36 THE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY . sons , there would still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which make it clear that his denial must be understood as but a qualified one . Against his professed theory may be set his actual practice , which , as it seems to me , tacitly asserts that explanations of some social phenomena in terms of cause and effect are possible , if not explanations of all social phenomena . Thus , respecting the Vagrancy Act of 1547 , which made a slave of a confirmed vagrant , Mr. Froude says : ? " In the condition of things which was now commencing . . . . neither this nor any other penal act against idleness could be practically enforced . " 11 That is to say , the operation of an agency brought into play was neutralized by the operation of natural causes coexisting . Again , respecting the enclosure of commons and amalgamation of farms , &c.,; Mr. Froude writes : ? " Under the late reign these tendencies had , with great difficulty , been held partially in check , but on the death of Henry they acquired new force and activity . " " Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain other forces , produced their natural effects when the antagonism ceased . Yet again , Mr. Froude explains that , " unhappily , two causes debased currency and an alteration of the farming system were operating to produce the rise of prices . " " And throughout Mr. Froude 's History of England there are , I need scarcely say , other cases in which he ascribes social changes to causes rooted in human nature . Moreover , in his lecture on The Science of History , there is a distinct enunciation of " one lesson of History ; " namely , that " the moral law is written on the tablets of eternity Justice and truth alone endure and live . Injustice and falsehood may be long-lived , but doomsday conies at last to them , in French revolutions and other terrible ways . " And elsewhere he says that . " the miseries and horrors which are now destroying the Chinese Empire are the direct and organic results of the moral profligacy of its inhabitants.114 Each of these statements tacitly asserts that certain social relations , and actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably detrimental ? an historic induction furnishing a basis for positive deduction . So that we must not interpret Mr. Froude too literally when he alleges the " impossibility of forming scientific calculations of what men will // do before the fact , or scientific explanations of what they have done after the fact . " Another writer who denies the possibility of a Social Science , or who , at any rate , admits it only as a science which has its relations of phenomena so traversed by providential influences that it does not come within the proper definition of a science , is Canon Kingsley . In his address on The Limits of Exact Science as applied to History , he says " You say that as the laws of matter are inevitable , so probably are the laws of human life ? Be it so : but in what sense are the laws of matter inevitable ? Potentially or actually ? Even in the seemingly most uniform and universal law , where do we find the inevitable or the irresistible ? Is there not in nature a perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing the most endless and unexpected variety of results ? Can not each law be interfered with at any moment by some other law , so that the first law , though- it may struggle for the mastery , shall be for an indefinite time utterly defeated ? The law of gravity is immutable enough : but do all stones veritably fall to the ground ? Certainly not , if I choose to catch one , and keep it in my hand . It remains there by laws ; and the law of gravity is there , too , making it feel heavy in my hand : but it has not fallen to the ground , and will not , till I let it . So much for the inevitable action of the laws of gravity , as of others . Potentially , it is immutable ; but actually , it can be conquered by other laws . " 15 This passage , severely criticized , if I remember rightly , when the address was originally published , it would be scarcely fair to quote were it not that Canon Kingsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Roman and the Teuton . The very unusual renderings of scientific ideas which it contains , need here be only enumerated . Mr. Kingsley differs profoundly from philosophers and men of science , in regarding a law as itself a power or force , and so in thinking of one law as " conquered by other laws ; " whereas the accepted conception of law is that of an established order , to which the manifestations of a power or force conform . He enunciates , too , a quite-exceptional view of gravitation . As conceived by astronomers and physicists , gravitation is a universal and overacting force , which portions of matter exercise on one another when at sensible distances ; and the law of this force is that it varies directly as the mass and inversely as the square of the distance . Mr. Kingsley 's view , is that the law of gravitation // is " defeated " if a stone is prevented from falling to the ground ? that the law " struggles " ( not the force ) , and that because it no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of gravity " ( not of gravity ) is suspended : the truth being that neither the force nor its law is in the slightest degree modified . Further , the theory of natural processes which Mr. Kingsley has arrived at , seems to be that when two or more forces ( or laws , if he prefers it ) come into play , there is a partial or complete suspension of one by another . Whereas the doctrine held by men of science is , that the forces are all iii full operation , and the effect is their resultant ; so that , for example , when a shot is fired horizontally from a cannon , the force impressed on it produces in a given time just the same amount of horizontal motion as though gravity were absent , while gravity produces in that same time a fall just equal to that which it would have produced had the shot been dropped from the mouth of the cannon . Of course , holding these peculiar views of causation as displayed among simple physical phenomena , Canon Kingsley is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as long as man has the mysterious power of breaking the laws of his own being , such a sequence not only can not be discovered , but it can not exist . " At the same time it is manifest that until he comes to some agreement with men of science respecting conceptions of forces , of their laws , and of the modes iii which phenomena produced by compositions of forces are interpretable in terms of compound laws , no discussion of the question at issue can be carried on with profit . Without waiting for such an agreement , however , which is probably somewhat remote , Canon Kingsley 's argument may be met by putting side by side with it some of his own conclusions set forth elsewhere . In an edition of Alton Locke published since the delivery of the address above quoted from , there is a new preface containing , among others , the following passages : " The progress towards institutions more and more popular may be slow , but it is sure . Whenever any class has conceived the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hopes , unless it employs , or provokes , violence impossible in England . The thing will be . " . . . " If any young gentlemen look forward . . . . // to a Conservative reaction of any other kind than this . . . . to even the least stoppage of what the world calls progress ? which I should define as the putting in practice the results of inductive science ; ? then do they , like King Picrochole in Rabelais , look for a kingdom which shall be restored to them at the coming of the Cocqcigrues. " 18 And . in a preface addressed to workingmen , contained in an earlier edition , he says : " If you are better off than you were in 1848 , you owe it principally to those laws of political economy ( as they are called ) , which I call the brute natural accidents of supply and demand , " &c.19; Which passages offer explanations of changes now gone by as having been wrought out by natural forces in conformity with natural laws , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action will work out . That is to say , by the help of generalized experiences there is an interpretation of past phenomena . and a prevision of future phenomena . There is an implicit recognition of that Social Science which is explicitly denied . A reply to these criticisms may be imagined . In looking for whatever reconciliation is possible between these positions which seem so incongruous , we must suppose the intended assertion to be , that only general interpretations and previsions can be made , not those which are special . Bearing in mind Mr. Froude 's occasional explanations of historical phenomena as naturally caused , we must conclude that he believes certain classes of sociological facts ( as the politico-economical ) to be scientifically explicable , while other classes are not : though , if this be his view , it is not clear how , if the results of men 's wills , separate or aggregated , are incalculable , politico-economical actions can be dealt with scientifically ; since , equally with other social actions , they are determined by aggregated wills . Similarly , Canon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enunciating also certain laws of progress ? nay , even warning his hearers against the belief that he denies the applicability of the inductive method to social phenomena , ? must be assumed to think that the applicability of the inductive method is here but partial . Citing the title of his address and some of its sentences , he may say they imply simply that there are limits to the explanation of social facts in precise ways ; though this position // does not seem really reconcilable with the doctrine that social laws are liable to be at any time overruled , providentially or otherwise . But , merely hinting these collateral criticisms , this reply is to be met by the demurrer that it is beside the question . If the sole thing meant is that sociological previsions can be approximate only ? if the thing denied is the possibility of reducing Sociology to the form of an exact science ; then the rejoinder is that the thing denied is a thing which no one has affirmed . Only a moiety of science is exact science ? only phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as qualitatively . Of the remaining orders there are some produced by factors so numerous and so hard to measure , that to develop our knowledge of their relations into the quantitative form will be extremely difficult , if not impossible . But these orders of phenomena are not therefore excluded from the conception of Science . In Geology , in Biology , in Psychology , most of the previsions are qualitative only ; and where they are quantitative their quantitativeness , never quite definite , is mostly very indefinite . Nevertheless we unhesitatingly class these previsions as scientific . It is thus with Sociology . The phenomena it presents , involved in a higher degree than all others , are less than all other , capable of precise treatment : such of them as can be generalized , can be generalized only within wide limits of variation as to time and amount ; and there remains much that can not be generalized . But so far as there can be generalization , and so far as there can be interpretation based on it , so far there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such or such public arrangements will be beneficial or detrimental , tacitly expresses belief in a Social Science ; for he asserts , by implication , that there is a natural sequence among social actions , and that as the sequence is natural results may be foreseen . Reduced to a more concrete form , the case may be put thus : ? Mr. Froude and Canon Kingsley both believe to a considerable extent in the efficiency of legislation ? probably to a greater extent than it is believed in by some of those who assert the existence of a Social Science . To believe in the efficiency of legislation is to believe that certain prospective penalties or rewards will act as deterrents or incentives ? will // modify individual conduct , and therefore modify social action . Though it may be impossible to say that a given law will produce a foreseen effect on a particular person , yet no doubt is felt that it will produce a foreseen effect on the mass of persons . Though Mr. Froude , when arguing against Mr. Buckle , says that he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual by a doctrine of averages , " but that " unfortunately , the average of one generation need not be the average of the next ; " yet Mr. Froude himself so far believes in the doctrine of averages as to hold that legislative interdicts , with threats of death or imprisonment behind them , will restrain the great majority of men iii ways which can be predicted . While he contends that the results of individual will are incalculable , yet , by approving certain laws and condemning others , he tacitly affirms that the results of the aggregate of wills are calculable . And if this be asserted of the aggregate of wills as affected by legislation , it must be asserted of the aggregate of wills as affected by social influences at large . If it be held that the desire to avoid punishment will so act on the average of men as to produce an average foreseen result ; then it must also be held that on the average of men , the desire to get the greatest return for labour , the desire to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain applause , and so forth , will each of them poduce a certain average result . And to hold this is to hold that there can be prevision of social phenomena , and therefore Social Science . In brief , then , the alternative positions are these . On the one hand , if there is no natural causation throughout the actions of incorporated humanity , government and legislation are absurd . Acts of Parliament may , as well as not , be made to depend on the drawing of lots or the tossing of a coin ; or , rather , there may as well be none at all : social sequences having no ascertainable order , no effect can be counted upon ? everything is chaotic . On the other hand , if there is natural causation , then the combination of forces by which every combination of effects is produced , produces that combination of effects in conformity with the laws of the forces . And if so , it behoves us to use all diligence in ascertaining what the forces are , what are their laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Such further elucidation as is possible will be gained by discussing the question to which we now address ourselves ? the Nature of the Social Science . Along with a definite idea of this , will come a perception that the denial of a Social Science has arisen from the confusing of two essentially-different classes of phenomena which societies present ? the one class , almost ignored by historians , constituting the subject-matter of Social Science , and the other class , almost exclusively occupying them , admitting of scientific co-ordination in a very small degree , if at all . CHAPTER III . NATURE OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE . OUT of bricks , well burnt , hard , and sharp-angled , lying in heaps by his side , the bricklayer builds , even without mortar , a wall of some height that has considerable stability . With bricks made of bad materials , irregularly burnt , warped , cracked , and many of them broken , he can not build a dry wall of the same height and stability . The dockyard-labourer , piling cannon-shot , is totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bricks stand . There are , indeed , certain definite shapes into which they may be piled ? that of a tetrahedron , or that of a pyramid having a square base , or that of an elongated wedge allied to the pyramid . In any of these forms they may be put together symmetrically and stably ; but not in forms with vertical sides or highly-inclined sides . Once more , if , instead of equal spherical shot , the masses to be piled are boulders , partially but irregularly rounded , and of various sizes , no definite stable form is possible . A loose heap , indefinite in its surface and angles , is all the labourer can make of them . Putting which several facts together , and asking what is the most general truth they imply , we see it to be this ? that the character of the aggregate is determined by the characters of the units . If we pass from units of these visible , tangible kinds , to the units contemplated by chemists and physicists as making up masses of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each combination of elements , each re-combination of the compounds , has a form of crystallization . Though its crystals differ in their sizes , and are liable to be modified by truncations of angles and apices , as well as by partial mergings into one another , yet the type of structure , as shown by 43 // cleavage , is constant : particular kinds of molecules severally have particular shapes into which they settle themselves as they aggregate . And though in some cases it happens that a substance , simple or compound , has two or even more forms of aggregation , yet the recognized interpretation is , that these different forms are the forms assumed by molecules made different in their structures by allotropic or isomeric changes . So constant is the relation between the nature of any molecules and their mode of crystallizing , that , given two kinds of molecules which are known , from their chemical actions , to be closely allied in their natures . and it is inferred with certainty that their crystals will be closely allied . In brief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics and chemistry , that throughout all phenomena presented by dead matter , the natures of the units necessitate certain traits in the aggregates . This truth is again exemplified by aggregates of living matter . In the substance of each species of plant or animal , there is a proclivity towards the structure which that plant or animal presents ? a proclivity conclusively proved in cases where the conditions to the maintenance of life are sufficiently simple , and where the tissue has not assumed a structure too finished to permit re-arrangement . The perpetually-cited case of the polype , each part of which , when it is cut into several , presently puts on the polype-shape , and gains structures and powers like those of the original whole , illustrates this truth among animals . Among plants it is well exemplified by the Begonias . Here a complete plant grows from a fragment of a leaf stuck in the ground ; and , in Begonia phylloinaniaca , complete plants grow even out of scales that fall from the leaves and the stem ? a fact showing , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , have for their type of aggregation the type of the organism they belong to ; and reminding us of the universal fact that the units composing every germ , animal or vegetal , have a proclivity towards the parental type of aggregation . Thus , given the natures of the units , and the nature of the aggregate they form is pre-determined . I say the nature , meaning , of course , the essential traits , and not including the incidental . By the characters of the units are necessitated // certain limits within which the characters of the aggregate must fall . The circumstances attending aggregation greatly modify the results ; but the truth here to be recognized is , that these circumstances , in some cases perhaps preventing aggregation altogether , in other cases impeding it , in other cases facilitating it more or less , can never give to the aggregate , characters that do not consist with the characters of the units . No favouring conditions will give the labourer power to pile cannon-shot into a vertical wall ; no favouring conditions will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular system , to crystallize , like sulphate of soda , on the oblique prismatic system ; no favouring conditions will enable the fragment of a polype to take on the structure of a mollusk . Among such social aggregates as inferior creatures fall into , more or less definitely , the same truth holds . Whether they live in a mere assemblage , or whether they live iii something like an organized union with division of labour among its members , as happens in many cases , is unquestionably determined by the properties of the units . Given the structures and consequent instincts of the individuals as we find them , and the community they form will inevitably present certain traits ; and no community having such traits can be formed out of individuals having other structures and instincts . Those who have been brought up in the belief that there is one law for the rest of the Universe and another law for mankind , will doubtless be astonished by the proposal to include aggregates of men in this generalization . And yet that the properties of the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently holds of societies as of other things . A general survey of tribes and nations , past and present , shows clearly enough that it is so : and a brief consideration of the conditions shows , with no less clearness , that it must be so . Ignoring for the moment the special traits of races and individuals , observe the traits common to members of the species at large ; and consider how these must affect their relations when associated . // They have all needs for food , and have corresponding desires . To all of them exertion is a physiological expense ; must bring a certain return of nutriment , if it is not to be detrimental ; and is accompanied by repugnance when pushed to excess , or even before reaching it . They are all of them liable to bodily injury , without accompanying pain , from various extreme physical actions ; and they are liable to emotional pains , of positive and negative kinds , from one another 's actions . As says Shylock , insisting on that human nature which Jews have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? hath not a Jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ? fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer , as a Christian is ? If you prick us , do we not bleed ? if you tickle us , do we not laugh if you poison us , do we not die ? and if you wrong ns , shall we not revenge ? If we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that . " Conspicuous , however , as is this possession of certain fundamental qualities by all individuals , there is no adequate recognition of the truth that from these individual qualities must result certain qualities in an assemblage of individuals ; that in proportion as the individuals forming one assemblage are like in their qualities to the individuals forming another assemblage , the two assemblages will have likenesses ; and that the assemblages will differ in their characters in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other . Yet when this , which is almost a truism , has been admitted , it can not be denied that in every community there is a group of phenomena growing naturally out of the phenomena presented by its members ? a set of properties in the aggregate determined by the sets of properties in the units ; and that the relations of the two sets form the subjectmatter of a science . It needs but to ask what would happen if men avoided one another , as various inferior creatures do , to see that the very possibility of a society depends on a certain emotional property in the individual . It needs but to ask what would happen if each man liked best the men who gave him most pain , to perceive that social relations , supposing them to be possible , would be utterly unlike the social relations resulting from the greater liking which men indiNATURE // vidually have for others who give them pleasure . It needs but to ask what would happen if , instead of ordinarily preferring the easiest ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most troublesome ways , to infer that then , a society , if one could exist , would be a widely-different society from any we know . And if , as these extreme cases show us , cardinal traits in societies are determined by cardinal traits in men , it can not be questioned that less-marked traits in societies are determined by less-marked traits in men ; and that there must everywhere be a consensus between the special structures and actions of the one and the special structures and actions of the other . Setting out , then , with this general principle , that the properties of the units determine the properties of the aggregate , we conclude that there must be a Social Science expressing the relations between the two , with as much definiteness as the natures of the phenomena permit . Beginning with types of men who form but small and incoherent social aggregates , such a science has to show in what ways the individual qualities , intellectual and emotional , negative further aggregation . It has to explain how slight modifications of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat larger aggregates possible . It has to trace out , in aggregates of some size , the genesis of the social relations , regulative and operative , into which the members fall . It has to exhibit the stronger and more prolonged social influences which , by further modifying the characters of the units , facilitate further aggregation with consequent further complexity of social structure . Among societies of all orders and sizes , from the smallest and rudest up to the largest and most civilized , it has to ascertain what traits there are in common , determined by the common traits of human beings ; what less-general traits , distinguishing certain groups of societies , result from traits distinguishing certain races of men ; and what peculiarities in each society are traceable to the peculiarities of its members . In every case it has for its subjectmatter the growth , development , structure , and functions of the social aggregate , as brought about by the mutual actions of individuals whose natures are partly like those of all men , partly like those of kindred races , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , to be explained with due reference to the conditions each society is exposed to ? the conditions furnished by its locality and by its relations to neighbouring societies . Noting this merely to prevent possible misapprehensions , the fact which here concerns us , is , not that the Social Science exhibits these or those special truths , but that , given men having certain properties , and an aggregate of such men must have certain derivative properties which form the subject-matter of a science . " But were we not told some pages back , that in societies , causes and effects are related in ways so involved that prevision is often impossible ? Were we not warned against rashly taking measures for achieving this or that desideratum , regardless of the proofs , so abundantly supplied by the past , that agencies set in action habitually work out results never foreseen ? And were not instances given of all-important changes that were due to influences from which no one would have anticipated them ? If so , how can there be a Social Science ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to prevent the consolidation of Germany , would be the very means of consolidating it ; if to M. Thiers , five-and-twenty years ago , it would have seemed a dream exceeding all ordinary dreams in absurdity , that he would be fired at from his own fortifications ; how in the name of wonder is it possible to formulate social phenomena in anything approaching scientific order ? " The difficulty thus put in as strong a form as I can find for it . is that which , clearly or vaguely , rises in the minds of most to whom Sociology is proposed as a subject to be studied after scientific methods , with the expectation of reaching results having scientific certainty . Before giving to the question its special answer , let me give it a general answer . The science of Mechanics has reached a development higher than has been reached by any but the purely-abstract sciences . Though we may not call it perfect , yet the great accuracy of the predictions which its ascertained principles enable astronomers to make , shows how near to perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery-officer prove that in their applications to terrestrial motions these principles yield // previsions of considerable exactness . But now , taking Mechanics as the type of a highly-developed science , let us note what it enables us to predict , and what it does not enable us to predict , respecting some concrete phenomenon . Say that there is a mine to be exploded . Ask what will happen to the fragments of matter sent into the air . Then observe how much we can infer from established dynamical laws . By that common observation which precedes the more exact observations of science , we are taught that all the fragments , having risen to heights more or less various , will fall ; that they will reach the ground at scattered places within a circumscribed area , and at somewhat different times . Science enables us to say more than this . From those same principles whence are inferable the path of a planet or a projectile , it deduces the truth that each fragment will describe a curve ; that all the curves , though individually different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by atmospheric resistance ) they will severally be portions of ellipses so eccentric as to be indistinguishable from parabolas ? such parts of them , at least , as are described after the rush of gases ceases further to accelerate the fragments . But while the principles of Mechanics help us to these certainties , we can not learn from them anything more definite respecting the courses that will be taken by particular fragments . Whether , of the mass overlying the powder to be exploded , the part on the left will be propelled upwards in one fragment or several ? whether this piece will be shot higher than that ? whether any , and if so , which , of the projected masses will be stopped in their courses by adjacent objects they strike ? ? are questions it can not answer . Not that there will be any want of conformity to law in these results ; but that the data on which predictions of them are to be based , can not be obtained . Observe , then , that respecting a concrete phenomenon of some complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are mainly general , or only partially special . Seeing that this is so , even where the causes and effects are not greatly involved , and where the science of them is well developed , much more may we expect it to be so among the most involved causes and effects , the science of which is but rudimentary . This contrast between the generalities that ad-06- // mit of prevision and the specialties that do not admit of prevision , will be still more clearly seen on passing from this preliminary illustration to an illustration iii which the analogy , is closer . What can we say about the future of this newly-born child ? Will it die of some disorder during infancy ? Will it survive awhile , and be carried off by scarlet fever or whooping-cough ? Will it have measles or small-pox , and succumb to one or the other ? None of these questions can be answered . Will it some day fall down-stairs , or be run over , or set fire to its clothes ; and be killed or maimed by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answers . None can tell whether in boyhood there may come epilepsy , or St. Vitus 's dance , or other formidable affection . Looking at the child now in the nurse 's arms , done can foresee with certainty that it will be stupid or intelligent , tractable or perverse . Equally beyond possibility of prediction are those events which , if it survives , will occur to it in maturity ? partly caused by its own nature , and partly by surrounding conditions . Whether there will come the success due to skill and perseverance ; whether the circumstances will be such as to give these scope or not ; whether accidents will thwart or favour efforts ; are wholly - unanswerable inquiries . That is to say , the facts we ordinarily class as biographical , do not admit of prevision . If from quite special facts we turn to fact ? somewhat less special which the life of this infant will present , we find , among those that are quasi-biographical , a certain degree of prevision possible . Though the unfolding of the faculties is variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual slowness , yet there is such order in the unfolding as enables us to say that the child will not be a mathematician or a dramatist at three years old , will not be a psychologist by the time he is ten , will not reach extended political conceptions while his voice is still unbroken . Moreover , of the emotional nature we may make certain predictions of a kindred order . Whether he will marry or not , no one can say ; but it is possible to say , if not with certainty still with much probability , that after a certain age an inclination to // marry will arise ; and though none can tell whether he will have children , yet that , if he has , some amount of the paternal feeling will be manifested , may be concluded as very likely . But now if , looking at the entire assemblage of facts that will be presented during the life of this infant as it becomes mature , decays and dies , we pass over the biographical and quasi-biographical , as admitting of either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of facts that may be asserted beforehand : some with a high degree of probability , and some with certainty ? some with great definiteness and some within moderate limits of variation . I refer to the facts of growth , development , structure , and function . Along with that love of personalities which exalts everything inconstant in human life into a matter of interest , there goes the habit of regarding whatever is constant in human life as a matter of no interest ; and so , when contemplating the future of the infant , there is a tacit ignoring of all the vital phenomena it will exhibit ? phenomena that are alike knowable and important to be known . The anatomy and physiology of Man , comprehending under these names not only the structures and functions of the adult , but the progressive establishment of these structures and functions during individual evolution , form the subject-matter of what every one recognizes as a science . Though there is imperfect exactness in the generalized coexistences and sequences making up this science ; though general truths respecting structures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though anomalies of function also occur to negative absolute prediction ; though there are considerable variations of the limits within which growth and structure may range , and considerable differences between the rates of functions and between the times at which functions are established ; yet no one doubts that the biological phenomena presented by the human body , may be organized into a knowledge having the definiteness which constitutes it scientific , in the understood sense of that word . If , now , any one , insisting on the incalculableness of a child 's future , biographically considered , asserted that the child , therefore , presented no subject-matter for science , ignor52 THE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY . ing altogether what we will for the moment call its anthropology ( though the meaning now given to the word scarcely permits this use of it ) , he would fall into a conspicuous error ? an error in this case made conspicuous because we are able daily to observe the difference between an account of the living body , and an account of its conduct and the events that occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Biography is to Anthropology , History is to Sociology ? History , I mean , as commonly conceived . The kind of relation which the sayings and doings that make up the ordinary account of a man 's life , bear to an account of his bodily and mental evolution , structural and functional , is like the kind of relation borne by that narrative of a nation 's actions and fortunes its historian gives us , to a description of its institutions , regulative and operative , and the ways in which their structures and functions have gradually established themselves . And if it is an error to say that there is no Science of Man , because the events of a man 's life can not be foreseen , it is equally an error to say that there is no Science of Society , because there can be no prevision of the occurrences which make up ordinary history . Of course , I do not say that the parallel between an individual organism and a social organism is so close , that the distinction to be clearly drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other . The structures and functions of the social organism are obviously far less specific , far more modifiable , far more dependent on conditions that are variable and never twice alike . All I mean is that , as in the one case so in the other , there lie underneath the phenomena of conduct , not forming subject-matter for science , certain vital phenomena , which do forrn subject-matter for science . Just as in the man there are structures and functions which make possible the doings his biographer tells of , so in the nation there are structures and functions which make possible the doings its historian tells of ; and in both cases it is with these structures and functions , in their origin , development , and decline , that science is concerned . To make better the parallel , and further to explain the // nature of the Social Science , we must say that the morphology and physiology of Society , instead of corresponding to the morphology and physiology of Man , correspond rather to morphology and physiology in general . Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into classes and sub-classes ? not , indeed , into classes and sub-classes having anything like the same definiteness or the same constancy , but nevertheless having likenesses and differences which justify the putting of them into major groups most-markedly contrasted , and , within these , arranging them in minor groups less-markedly contrasted . And just as Biology discovers certain general traits of development , structure , and function , holding throughout all organisms , others holding throughout certain great groups , others throughout certain sub-groups these contain ; so Sociology has to recognize truths of social development , structure , and function , that are some of them universal , some of them general , some of them special . For , recalling the conclusion previously reached , it is manifest that in so far as human beings , considered as social units , have properties in common , the social aggregates they form will have properties in common ; that likenesses of nature holding throughout certain of the human races , will originate likenesses of nature in the nations arising out of them ; and that such peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must result in distinctive characters possessed in common by the communities into which they organize themselves . So that whether we look at the matter in the abstract or in the concrete , we reach the same conclusion . We need but to glance , on the one hand , at the varieties of uncivilized men and the structures of their tribes , and , on the other hand , at the varieties of civilized men and the structures of their nations , to see inference verified by fact . And thus recognizing , both a priori and a posteriori , these relations between the phenomena of individual human nature and the phenomena of incorporated human nature , we can not fail to see that the phenomena of incorporated human nature form the subjectmatter of a science . And now to make more definite the conception of a Social Science thus shadowed forth in a general way , let me set down // a few truths of the kind indicated . Some that I propose to name are very familiar ; and others I add , not because of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposition . The aim is simply to convey a clear idea of the nature of sociological truths . Take , first , the general fact that along with social aggregation there always goes some kind of organization . In the very lowest stages , where the assemblages are very small and very incoherent , there is no established subordination ? no centre of control . Chieftainships of settled kinds come only along with larger and more coherent aggregates . The evolution of a governmental structure having some strength and permanence , is the condition under which alone any considerable growth of a society can take place . A differentiation of the originally-homogeneous mass of units into a co-ordinating part and a co-ordinated part , is the indispensable initial step . Along with evolution of societies in size there goes evolution of their co-ordinating centres ; which , having become permanent , presently become more or less complex . In small tribes , chieftainship , generally wanting in stability , is quite simple ; but as tribes become larger by growth , or by reduction of other tribes to subjection , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing agencies . Simple and familiar as are these facts , we are not , therefore , to overlook their significance . That men rise into the state of social aggregation only on condition that they lapse into relations of inequality in respect of power , and are made to cooperate as a whole only by the agency of a structure securing obedience , is none the less a fact in science because it is a trite fact . This is a primary common trait in social aggregates derived from a common trait in their units . It is a truth in Sociology , comparable to the biological truth that the first step in the production of any living organism , high or low , is a certain differentiation whereby a peripheral portion becomes distinguished from a central portion . And such exceptions to this biological truth as we find in those minute non-nucleated portions of protoplasm that are the very lowest living things , are paralleled by those exceptions to the soNATURE // ciological truth , seen in the small incoherent assemblages formed by the very lowest types of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , is , in small primitive societies , not only imperfectly established but vague . The chief does not at first become unlike his fellow-savages in his functions , otherwise than by exercising greater sway . He hunts , makes his weapons , works , and manages his private affairs , in just the same ways as the rest ; while in war he differs from other warriors only by his predominant influence , not by ceasing to be a private soldier . And along with this slight separation from the rest of the tribe in military functions and industrial functions , there is only a slight separation politically : judicial action is but very feebly represented by exercise of his personal authority in keeping order . At a higher stage , the power of the chief being well established , he no longer supports himself . Still he remains undistinguished industrially from other members of the dominant class , which has grown up while chieftainship has been getting settled ; for he simply gets productive work done by deputy , as they do . Nor is a further extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the industrial functions ; for he habitually remains a regulator of production , and in many cases a regulator of trade , presiding over acts of exchange . Of his several controlling activities , this last is , however , the one which he first ceases personally to carry on . Industry early shows a tendency towards selfcontrol , apart from the control which the chief exercises more and more as political and military head . The primary social differentiation which we have noted between the regulative part and the operative part , is presently followed by a distinction , which eventually becomes very marked , between the internal arrangements of the two parts : the operative part slowly developing within itself agencies by which processes of production , distribution , and exchange are co-ordinated , while co-ordination of the non-operative part continues on its original footing . Along with a development which renders conspicuous the separation of the operative and regulative structures , there goes a development within the regulative structures them56 THE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY . selves . The chief , at first uniting the characters of king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his functions more and more specialized as the evolution of the society in size and complexity advances . Though remaining supreme judge , he does most of his judging by deputy ; though remaining nominally head of his army , the actual leading of it falls more and more into the hands of subordinate officers ; though still retaining ecclesiastical supremacy , his priestly functions practically almost cease ; though in theory the maker and administrator of the law , the actual making and administration lapse more and more into other hands . So that , stating the facts broadly , out of the original co-ordinating agent having undivided functions , there eventually develop several co-ordinating agencies which divide these functions among them . Each of these agencies , too , follows the same law . Originally simple , it step by step subdivides into many parts , and becomes an organization , administrative , judicial , ecclesiastical , or military , having graduated classes within itself , and amore or less distinct form of government within itself . I will not complicate this statement by doing more than recognizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapse into the hands of one man ( which , however , in early stages of social evolution is an unstable modification ) . And I must explain that the above general statements are to be taken with the qualification that differences of detail are passed over to gain brevity and clearness . Add to which that it is beside the purpose of the argument to carry the description beyond these first stages . But duly bearing in mind that without here elaborating a Science of Sociology , nothing more than a rude outline of cardinal facts can be given , enough has been said to show that in the development of social structures , there may be recognized certain most-general facts , certain less-general facts , and certain facts successively more special ; just as there may be recognized general and special facts of evolution in individual organisms . To extend , as well as to make clearer , this conception of the Social Science , let me here set down a question which comes within its sphere . What is the relation in a society // between structure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth ? after what point does it retard growth ? at what point does it arrest growth ? There exists in the individual organism a duplex relation between growth and structure which it is difficult adequately to express . Excluding the cases of a few low organisms living under special conditions , we may properly say that great growth is not possible without high structure . The whole animal kingdom , throughout its invertebrate and vertebrate types , may be cited in evidence . On the other hand , among the superior organisms , and especially among those leading active lives , there is a marked tendency for completion of structure to go along with arrest of growth . While an animal of elevated type is growing rapidly , its organs continue imperfectly developed ? the bones remain partially cartilaginous , the muscles are soft , the brain lacks definiteness ; and the details of structure throughout all parts are finished only after growth has ceased . Why these relations are as we find them , it is not difficult to see . That a young animal may grow , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , and so forth ; to do which it must have tolerablycomplete viscera , vascular system , &c.; That it may eventually become able to get its own food , it has to develop gradually the needful appliances and aptitudes ; to which end it must begin with limbs , and senses , and nervous system , that have considerable degrees of efficiency . But along with every increment of growth achieved by the help of these partiallydeveloped structures , there has to go an alteration of the structures themselves . If they were rightly adjusted to the preceding smaller size , they are wrongly adjusted to the succeeding greater size . Hence they must be re-moulded ? unbuilt and re-built . Manifestly , therefore , in proportion as the previous building has been complete , there arises a great ob stacle in the shape of un-building and re-building . The bones show us how this difficulty is met . In the thigh-bone of a boy , for instance , there exists between the head and the cylindrical part of the bone , a place where the original cartilaginous state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartilage in which new osseous matter is deposited , the shaft of the bone is lengthened : the like going on in an // answering place at the other end of the shaft . Complete ossification at these two places occurs only when the bone has ceased to increase in length ; and , on considering what would have happened had the bone been ossified from end to end before its lengthening was complete , it will be seen how great an obstacle to growth is thus escaped . What holds here , holds throughout the organism : though structure up to a certain point is requisite for growth , structure beyond that point impedes growth . How necessary is this relation we shall equally perceive in a more complex case ? say , the growth of an entire limb . There is a certain size and proportion of parts , which a limb ordinarily has in relation to the rest of the body . Throw upon that limb extra function , and within moderate limits it will increase in strength and bulk . If the extra function begins early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual size ; but if the extra function begins after maturity , the deviation is less : in neither case , however , being great . If we consider how increase of the limb is effected , we shall see why this is so . More active function brings a greater local supply of blood ; and , for a time , new tissue is formed in excess of waste . But the local supply of blood is limited by the sizes of the arteries which bring it ; and though , up to a certain point , increase of flow is gained by temporary dilatation of them , yet beyond that point increase can be gained only by un-building and rebuilding the arteries . Such alterations of arteries slowly take place ? less slowly with the smaller peripheral ones , more slowly with the larger ones out of which these branch ; since these have to be altered all the way back to their points of divergence from the great central blood vessels . In like manner , the channels for carrying off waste products must be re-modelled , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the centres from which they come , must be adjusted to the greater demands upon them . Nay , more ; with a given visceral system , a large extra quantity of blood can not be permanently given to one part of the body , without decreasing the quantities given to other parts ; and , therefore , structural changes have to be made by which the drafting-off of blood to these other parts is diminished . Hence the great resistance to increase in the size of a limb // beyond a certain moderate limit . Such increase can not be effected without un-building and re-building not only the parts that directly minister to the limb , but , eventually , all the remoter parts . So that the bringing of structures into perfect fitness for certain requirements , immensely hinders the adaptation of them to other requirements ? re-adjustments become difficult in proportion as adjustments are made complete . How far does this law hold in the social organism ? To what extent does it happen here , too , that the multiplying and elaborating of institutions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impediments to the development of better institutions and to the future gaining of higher ends ? Socially , as well as individually , organization is indispensable to growth : beyond a certain point there can not be further growth without further organization . Yet there is not a little reason for suspecting that beyond this point organization is indirectly repressive ? increases the obstacles to those re-adjustments required for larger growth and more perfect structure . Doubtless the aggregate we call a society is much more plastic than an individual living aggregate to which it is here compared ? its type is far less fixed . Nevertheless , there is evidence that its type tends continually to become fixed , and that each addition to its structures is a step towards the fixation . A few instances will show how this is true alike of the material structures a society develops and of its institutions , political or other . Cases , insignificant , perhaps , but quite to the point , are furnished by our appliances for locomotion . Not to dwell on the minor ones within cities , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to better arrangements , let us pass to railways . Observe how the inconveniently-narrow gauge ( which , taken from that of stage-coach wheels , was itself inherited from an antecedent system of locomotion ) , has become an insuperable obstacle to a better gauge . Observe , also , how the type of carriage , which was derived from the body of a stage-coach ( some of the early first-class carriages bearing the words " trig juneta in uno " ) , having become established , it is immensely difficult now to introduce the more convenient type later established in America ; where // they profited by our experience , but were not hampered by our adopted plans . The enormous capital invested in our stock of carriages can not be sacrificed . Gradually to introduce carriages of the American type , by running them along with those of our own type , would be very difficult , because of our many partings and joinings of trains . And thus we are obliged to go on with a type that is inferior . Take , again , our system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago as a panacea for sundry sanitary evils , and spread as it has been by force of law through all our great towns , this system can not now be replaced by a better system without extreme difficulty . Though , by necessitating decomposition where oxygen can not get , and so generating chemical compounds that are unstable and poisonous , it has in many cases produced the very diseases it was to have prevented ; though , by delivering the morbid products from fever-patients , &c.,; into a branching tube which , communicating with all houses , effectually conveys to them infecting gases that are kept out only so long as stink-traps are in good order ; yet it has become almost out of the question now to adopt those methods by which the excreta of towns may be got rid of at once innocuously and usefully . Nay , worse ? one part of our sanitary administration having insisted on a sewage-system by which Oxford , Reading , Maidenhead , Windsor , &c.,; pollute the water London has to drink , another part of our sanitary administration makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it charges with causing disease ( not remarking , however , that law-enforced arrangements have produced the impurity ) . And now there must be a re-organization that will be immensely impeded by the existing premature organization , before we can have either pure air or pure water . Our mercantile arrangements , again , furnish abundant illustrations teaching the same lesson . In each trade there is an established course of business ; and however obvious may be some better course , the difficulties of altering the settled routine are , if not insurmountable , still very considerable . Take , for instance , the commerce of literature . In days when a letter cost a shilling and no book-post existed , there grew up an organization of wholesalers and retailers to convey books from publishers to readers : a profit being reached by each distributNATURE OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE . GI ing agent , primary and secondary . Now that a book may be ordered for a half-penny and sent for a few pence , the old system of distribution might be replaced by one that would diminish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the interests of distributors practically negative the change . An advertised proposal to supply a book direct by post at a reduced rate , offends the trade ; and by ignoring the book they check its sale more than its sale is other wise furthered . And so an old organization , once very serviceable , now stands in the way of a better organization . The commerce of literature furnishes another illustration . At a time when the reading public was small and books were dear , there grew up circulating libraries , enabling people to read books without buying them . At first few , local , and unorganized , these circulating libraries have greatly multiplied , and have become organized throughout the kingdom : the result being that the demand for library-circulation is in many cases the chief demand . This arrangement being one which makes few copies supply many readers , the price per copy must be high , to obtain an adequate return on the edition . And now reading people in general , having been brought up to the habit of getting books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books themselves  --  would still get most of them through libraries even were they considerably cheapened . We are , therefore , except with works of very popular authors , prevented by the existing system of book-distribution in England from adopting the American system ? a system which , not adjusting itself to few libraries but to many private purchasers , issues large editions at low prices . Instances of another class are supplied by our educational institutions . Richly endowed , strengthened by their prestige , and by the bias given to those they have brought up , our colleges , public schools , and other kindred schools early founded , useful as they once were , have long been enormous impediments to a higher education . By subsidizing the old , they have starved the new . Even now they are retarding a culture better in matter and manner ; both by occupying the field , and by partially incapacitating those who pass through them for seeing what a better culture is . Evidence of a kindred kind is offered by the educational organization developed for // dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denominationalism in teaching , might alone show to any one who looks for the wider meanings of facts , that a structure which has ramified throughout a society , acquired an army of salaried officials looking for personal welfare and promotion , backed by classes , ecclesiastical and political , whose ideas and interests they further , is a structure which , if not unalterable , is difficult to alter in proportion as it is highly developed . These few examples , which might be supported by others from the military organization , the ecclesiastical organization , the legal organization , will make comprehensible the analogy I have indicated ; while they make clearer the nature of the Social Science , by bringing into view one of its questions . That with social organisms , as with individual organisms , structure up to a certain point is needful for growth is obvious . That in the one case , as in the other , continued growth implies un-building and re-building of structure , which therefore becomes in so far an impediment , seems also obvious . Whether it is true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of structure involves arrest of growth , and fixes the society to the type it has then reached , is a question to be considered . Without saying anything more by way of answer , it is , I think , manifest enough that this is one belonging to an order of questions entirely overlooked by those who contemplate societies from the ordinary historical point of view ; and one pertaining to that Social Science which they say does not exist . Are there any who utter the cui bono criticism ? Probably not a few . I think I hear from some whose mental attitude is familiar to me , the doubt whether it is worth while to ask what happens among savage tribes ; in what way chiefs and medicine-men arise ; how the industrial functions become separated from the political ; what are the original relations of the regulative classes to one another ; how far the social structure is determined by the emotional natures of individuals , how far by their ideas , how far by their enviromucut . Busied as men of this stamp are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they seemingly mean legislation // that recognises proximate causes and effects while ignoring remote ones ) , they doubt whether conclusions of the kind Social Science proposes to draw , are good for much when drawn . Something may , however , be said in defence of this study which they thus estimate . Of course , it is not to be put on the same level with those historical studies so deeply interesting to them . The supreme value of knowledge respecting the genealogies of kings , and the fates of dynasties , and the quarrels of courts , is beyond question . Whether or not the plot for the murder of Amy Robsart was contrived by Leicester himself , with Queen Elizabeth as an accomplice ; and whether or not the account of the Gowrie Conspiracy , as given by King James , was true ; are obviously doubts to be decided before there can be formed any rational conclusions respecting the development of our political institutions . That Friedrich I. of Prussia quarrelled with his stepmother , suspected her of trying to poison him , fled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intrigued and bribed to obtain his kingship ; that half-an-hour after his death his son Friedrich Wilhelm gave his courtiers notice to quit , commenced forthwith to economize his revenues , made it his great object to recruit and drill his army , and presently began to hate and bully his son ? these , and facts like these about all royal families in all ages , are facts without which civilization would obviously be incomprehensible . Nor can one dispense with full knowledge of events like those of Napoleon 's wars ? his Italian conquests and exactions , and perfidious treatment of Venice ; his expedition to Egypt , successes and massacres there , failure at Acre , and eventual retreat ; his various campaigns in Germany , Spain , Russia , &c.,; including accounts of his strategy , tactics , victories , defeats , slaughters ; for how , in the absence of such information , is it possible to judge what institutions should be advocated , and what legislative changes should be opposed ? Still , after due attention has been paid to these indispensable matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to the natural history of societies . Some guidance for political conduct would possibly be reached by asking  - -  What is the normal course of social evolution , and how will // it be effected by this or that policy ? It may turn out that legislative action of no kind can be taken that is not either in agreement with , or at variance with , the processes of national growth and development as naturally going on ; and that its desirableness is to be judged by this ultimate standard rather than by proximate standards . Without claiming too much , we may at any rate expect that , if there does exist an order among those structural and functional changes which societies pass through , knowledge of that order can scarcely fail to affect our judgments as to what is progressive and what retrograde ? what is desirable , what is practicable , what is Utopian . To those who think such an inquiry worthy to be pursued , will be addressed the chapters that are to follow . There are sundry considerations important to be dwelt upon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the science have to be added clear ideas of the conditions to successful study of it . These will henceforth occupy us . CHAPTER IV . DIFFICULTIES OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE . FROM the intrinsic natures of its facts , from our own natures as observers of its facts , and from the peculiar relation in which we stand towards the facts to be observed , there arise impediments in the way of Sociology greater than those in the way of any other science . The phenomena to be generalized are not of a directly-perceptible kind ? can not be noted by telescope and clock , like those of Astronomy ; can not be measured by dynamometer and thermometer , like those of Physics ; can not be elucidated by scales and test-papers , like those of Chemistry ; are not to be got at by scalpel and microscope , like the less obvious biological phenomena ; nor are to be recognized by introspection , like the phenomena Psychology deals with . They have severally to be established by putting together many details , no one of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Time , in ways that make them difficult of access . Hence the reason why even cardinal truths in Sociology , such as the division of labour , remain long unrecognized . That in advanced societies men follow different occupations , was indeed a generalization easy to make ; but that this form of social arrangement had neither been specially created , nor enacted by a king , but had grown up without forethought of any one , was a conclusion which could be reached only after many transactions of many kinds between men had been noted , remembered , and accounted for , and only after comparisons had been made between these transactions and those taking place between men in simpler societies and in earlier times . And when it is remembered that the data for the inference that labour becomes specialized , are far more accessible than 65 // the data for most other sociological inferences , it will be seen how greatly the advance of Sociology is hindered by the nature of its subject-matter . The characters of men as observers , add to this first difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take with them into sociological inquiries , the nodes of observation and reasoning which they have been accustomed to in other inquiries ? those of them , at least , who make any inquiries worthy to be so called . Passing over the great majority of the educated , and limiting ourselves to the very few who consciously collect data , compare them , and deliberately draw conclusions ; we may see that even these have to struggle with the difficulty that the habits of thought generated by converse with relatively-simple phenomena , partially unfit them for converse with these highly-complex phenomena . Faculty of every kind tends always to adjust itself to its work . Special adjustment to one kind of work involves more or less nonadjustment to other kinds . And hence , intellects disciplined in dealing with less-involved classes of facts , can not successfully deal with this most-involved class of facts without partially unlearning the methods they have learnt . From the emotional nature , too , there arise great obstacles . Scarcely any one can contemplate social arrangements and actions with the unconcern felt when contemplating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and correct drawing of inferences , there needs the calmness that is ready to recognize or to infer one truth as readily as another . But it is next to impossible thus to deal with the truths of Sociology . In the search for them , each is moved by feelings , more or less strong , which make him eager to find this evidence , oblivious of that which is at variance with it , reluctant to draw any conclusion but that already drawn . And though perhaps one in ten among those who think , is conscious that his judgment is being warped by prejudice , yet even in him the warp is not adequately allowed for . Doubtless in nearly every field of inquiry emotion is a perturbing intruder : mostly there is some preconception , and some amour propre that resists disproof of it . But a peculiarity of Sociology is , that the emotions with which its facts and conclusions are regarded , have unusual strength . The personal // interests are directly affected ; or there is gratification or offence to sentiments that have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the existing form of society , are excited , agreeably or disagreeably . And here we are introduced to the third kind of difficulty ? that caused by the position occupied , in respect to the phenomena to be generalized . In no other case has the inquirer to investigate the properties of an aggregate in which he is himself included . His relation towards the facts he here studies , we may figure to ourselves by comparing it to the relation between a single cell forming part of a living body , and the facts which that living body presents as a whole . Speaking generally , the citizen 's life is made possible only by due performance of his function in the place he fills ; and he can not wholly free himself from the beliefs and sentiments generated by the vital connexions hence arising between himself and his society . Here , then , is a difficulty to which no other science presents anything analogous . To cut himself off in thought from all his relationships of race , and country , and citizenship ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superstitions , generated in him by the life of his own society and his own time ? to look on all the changes societies have undergone and are undergoing , without reference to nationality , or creed , or personal welfare ; is what the average man can not do at all , and what the exceptional man can do very imperfectly . The difficulties of the Social Science , thus indicated in vague outline , have now to be described and illustrated in detail . CHAPTER V. OBJECTIVE DIFFICULTIES . ALONG with much that has of late years been done towards changing primitive history into myth , and along with much that has been done toward changing once-unquestioned estimates of persons living in past ages , much has been said about the untrustworthiness of historical evidence . Hence there will be ready acceptance of the statement that one of the impediments to sociological generalization , is the uncertainty of our data . We find this uncertainty not alone in early stories , such as those about the Amazons , their practices , the particular battles with them , &c.; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be were the persons and events historic . We find it even in accounts of a well-known people like the New-Zealanders , who " by some . . . are said to be intelligent , cruel , and brave ; by others weak , kindly , and cowardly . " ' And on remembering that between these extremes we have to deal with an enormous accumulation of conflicting statements , we can not but feel that the task of selecting valid evidence is in this case amore arduous one than in any other case . Passing over remote illustrations , let us take an immediate one . Last year advertisements announced the " Two-headed Nightingale , " and the walls of London were placarded with a figure in which one pair of shoulders were shown to bear two heads looking the same way ( I do not refer to the later placards , which partially differed from the earlier ) . To some , this descriptive name and answering diagram seemed sufficiently exact ; for in my hearing a lady , who had been to see this compound being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation . If we suppose this lady to 68 // have repeated in a letter that which I heard her say , and if we ask what would appear the character of the evidence to one who , some fifty years hence , had before him the advertisement , the representation , and the letter , we shall see that the alleged fact would be thought by him incontestable . Only if , after weary search through all the papers and periodicals of the time , he happened to come upon a certain number of the Lancet , would he discover that this combination was not that of two heads on one body , but that of two individuals united back to back , with heads facing opposite ways , and severally complete in all respects , except where the parts were so fused as to form a double pelvis , containing certain pelvic viscera common to the two . Seeing , then , that about facts so simple and so easily verifiable , where no obvious motive for misrepresentations exists , we can not count on true representations , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , being so diffused and so complex , are so difficult to observe , and in respect to which the perceptions are so much perverted by interests , and prepossessions , and party-feelings $ In exemplifying this difficulty , I will limit myself to cases supplied by the life of our own time : leaving it to be inferred that if , in a comparatively calm and critical age , sociological evidence is vitiated by various influences , much more must there have been vitiation of such evidence in the past , when passions ran higher and credulity was greater . Those who have lately become conscious of certain facts are apt to suppose those facts have lately arisen . After a changed state of mind has made us observant of occurrences we were before indifferent to , there often results the belief that such occurrences are more common than they were . It happens so even with accidents and diseases . Having lamed himself , a man is surprised to find how many lame people there are ; and , becoming dyspeptic , he discovers that dyspepsia is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a kindred reason he is prone to think that servants do not behave nearly so well as they did during his boyhood : not remembering that in Shakespeare 's days the service obtainable was similarly reprobated in comparison with " the constant service of the antique world . " In like manner , now // that he has sons to establish in life , he fancies that the difficulty of getting places is much greater than it used to be . As witnesses to social phenomena , men thus impressed by facts which did not before impress them , became perverters of evidence . Things they have suddenly recognized , they mistake for things that have suddenly come into existence ; and so are led to regard as a growing evil or good , that which is very likely a diminishing evil or good . Take an example or two . In generations not long passed away , sobriety was the exception rather than the rule : a man who had never been drunk was a rarity . Condiments were used to create thirst ; glasses were so shaped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied ; and a man 's worth was in part measured by the number of bottles he could take in . After a reaction had already diminished the evil among the upper and middle ranks , there came an open recognition of the evil ; resulting in Temperance Societies , which did their share towards further diminishing it . Then came the Teetotal Societies , more thorough-going in their views and more energetic in their acts , which have been making the evil still less . Such has been the effect of these causes , that for a long time past among the upper classes , the drinking which was once creditable has been thought a disgrace ; while among the lower classes it has greatly decreased , and come to be generally reprobated . Those , however , who , carrying on the agitations against it , have had their eyes more and more widely opened to the vice , assert or imply in their speeches and petitions that the vice is not only great but growing . Having in the course of a generation much mitigated it by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make others believe , that it is too gigantic to be dealt with otherwise than by repressive enactments ? Maine-Laws and Permissive-Prohibitory Bills . And , if we are to be guided by a Select Committee which has just reported , fines and imprisonments for drunkenness must be made far more severe than now , and reformatories must be established in which inebriates shall be dealt with much as criminals are dealt with . Take , again , the case of education . Go back far enough , and you find nobles not only incapable of reading and writOBJECTIVE // ing , but treating these accomplishments with contempt . Go back not quite so far , and you find , along with a slight encouragement by authority of such learning as referred to Theology , a positive discouragement of all other learning ; ' joined with the belief that only for the clergy is learning of any kind proper . Go back a much smaller distance , and you find in the highest classes inability to spell tolerably , joined with more or less of the feeling that good spelling was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that named by Shakespeare as shown by those who counted it " a meanness to write fair . " Down even to quite modern times , wellto-do farmers and others of their rank were by no means all of them able to read and write . Education , spreading thus slowly during so many centuries , has ( luring the last century spread with comparative rapidity . Since Raikes commenced Sunday-schools in 1771 ; since Lancaster , the Quaker , in 1796 set up the first of the schools that afterwards went by his name ; since 1811 , when the Church had to cease its opposition and become a competitor in educating poor children ; the strides have been enormous . A degree of ignorance which had continued the rule during so many centuries , was made , in the course of half a century , the exception . And then in 1834 , after this unobtrusive but speedy diffusion of knowledge , there came along with a growing consciousness of the still-remaining deficiency , the system of State-subsidies ; which , beginning with ? 20,000 , grew , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet now , after this vast progress at an ever-increasing rate , there has come the outcry that the nation is perishing for lack of knowledge . Any one not knowing the past , and judging from the statements of those who have been urging on educational organizations , would suppose that strenuous efforts are imperative to save the people from some gulf of demoralization and crime into which ignorance is sweeping them . How testimonies respecting objective facts are thus perverted by the subjective states of the witnesses , and how we have to be ever on our guard against this cause of vitiation in sociological evidence , may indeed be inferred from the illusions that daily mislead men in their comparisons of past with present . Returning after many years to the place of his boy72 THE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY . hood , and finding how insignificant are the buildings he remembered as so imposing , every one discovers that in this case it was not that the past was so grand , but that his impressibility was so great and his power of criticism so small He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally ; and that the apparant decline in various things is really due to the widening of his experiences and the growth of a judgment no longer so easily satisfied . Hence the mass of witnesses may be under the impression that there is going on a change just the reverse of that which is really going on ; as we see , for example , in the notion current in every age , that the size and strength of the race have been decreasing , when , as proved by bones , by mummies , by armour , and by the experiences of travellers in contact with aboriginal races , they have been on the average increasing . Most testimony , then , on which we have to form ideas of sociological states , past and present , has to be discounted to meet this cause of error ; and the rate of discount has to be varied according to the epoch , and the subject , and the witness . Beyond this vitiation of sociological evidence by general subjective states of the witnesses , there are vitiations due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be noted are of the class which foregone conclusions produce . Extreme cases are furnished by fanatical agitators , such as members of the Anti-Tobacco Society ; in the account of whose late meeting we read that " statistics of heart-disease , of insanity , of paralysis , and the diminished bulk and stature of the population of both sexes proved , according to the Report , that these diseases were attributable to the use of tobacco . " But without making much of instances so glaring as this , we may find abundant proof that evidence is in most cases unconsciously distorted by the pet theories of those who give it . Early in the history of our sanitary legislation , a leading officer of health , wishing to show the need for those measures he advocated , drew a comparison between the rate of mortality in some salubrious village ( in Cumberland , I think it was ) and the rate of mortality in London ; and then , pointing out the marked difference , alleged that this difference was due to " preventible causes " ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would exclude . Ignoring the fact that the carbonic acid exhaled by nearly three millions of people and by their fires , caused in the one case a vitiation of the air which in the other case did not exist ? ignoring the fact that most city-occupations are of necessity indoor , and many of them sedentary , while the occupations of village life are outof - door and active ? ignoring the fact that in many of the Londoners the activities are cerebral in a degree beyond that to which the constitution of the race is adapted , while in the villagers the activities are bodily , in a degree appropriate to the constitution of the race ; he set down the whole difference in the death-rate to causes of the kind which laws and officials might get rid of . A still more marked example of this effect of a cherished hypothesis in vitiating evidence , was once unconsciously yielded to me by another enthusiast for sanitary regulation . Producing his papers , he pointed out the great contrast between the number of deaths per annum in the small town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths per annum in a low district of London ? Bermondsey , or Lambeth , or some region on the Surrey side . On this great contrast he triumphantly dilated , as proving how much could be done by good drainage , ventilation , &e.; On the one hand , he passed over the fact that his suburban place was , in large measure , inhabited by a picked population ? people of means , well fed and clothed , able to secure all appliances for comfort , leading regular lives , free from over-work and anxiety . On the other hand , he passed over the fact that this low region of London was , by virtue of its lowness , one out of which all citizens pecuniarily able to take care of themselves escaped if they could , and into which were thrust great numbers whose poverty excluded them from better regions ? the ill-fed , the drunken , the dissolute , and others on the highway to death . Though , in the first case , the healthiness of the locality obviously drew to it an excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second case , the unhealthiness of the locality made it one in which an excess of those not likely to live long were left to dwell , or hid themselves to die ; yet the whole difference was put down to direct effects of pure air and impure air respectively . // Statements proceeding from witnesses whose judgments are thus warped ? statements republished by careless subeditors , and readily accepted by the uncritical who believe all they see in print , diffuse erroneous prepossessions ; which , again , tend to justify themselves by drawing the attention to confirmatory facts and away from facts that are adverse . Throughout all past time vitiations of evidence by influences of this nature have been going on in degrees varying with each people and each age ; and hence arises an additional obstacle to the obtainment of fit data . Yet another , and perhaps stronger , distorting influence existing in the medium through which facts reach us , results from the self-seeking , pecuniary or other , of those who testify . We require constantly to bear in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions are based , and on which legislation proceeds . Everyone knows this to be so where the evidence concerns mercantile affairs . That railway-enterprise , at first prompted by pressing needs for communication , presently came to . be prompted by speculators , professional and financial ; and that the estimates of cost , of traffic , of profits , &c.,; set forth in prospectuses were grossly misleading ; many readers have been taught by bitter experience . That the gains secured by schemers who float companies have fostered an organized system which has made falsification of data a business , and which , in the case of bubble Insurance Companies , has been worked so methodically that it has become the function of a journal to expose the frauds continually repeated , are also familiar facts : reminding us how , in these directions , it is needful to look very sceptically on the allegations put before us . But there is not so distinct a consciousness that in other than business-enterprises , self-seeking is an active cause of misrepresentation . Like the getting-up of companies , the getting-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , a means of advancement . As in the United States politics has become a profession , into which a man enters to get an income , so here there has grown up , though happily to a smaller extent , a professional philanthropy , pursued with a view to position , or to // profit , or to both . Much as the young clergyman in want of a benefice , feeling deeply the spiritual destitution of a suburb that has grown beyond churches , busies himself in raising funds to build a church , and probably does not , during his canvass , understate the evils to be remedied ; so every here and there an educated man with plenty of leisure and small income , greatly impressed with some social evil to be remedied or benefit to be achieved , makes himself the nucleus to an institution , or the spur to a movement . And since his success depends mainly on the strength of the case he makes out , it is not to be expected that the evils to be dealt with will be faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts adverse to his plan . As I can personally testify , there are those who , having been active in getting up schemes for alleged beneficial public ends , consider themselves aggrieved when not afterwards appointed salaried officials . The recent exposure of the " Free Dormitory Association , " which , as stated at a meeting of the Charity-Organization Society , was but one of a class , shows what this process may end in . And the vitiation of evidence is an inevitable concomitant . One whom I have known during his thirty years ' experience of Leagues , Alliances , Unions , &c.,; for various purposes , writes : ? " Like religious bodies , they Associations form creeds , and every adherent is expected to cry up the shibboleth of his party ... . All facts are distorted to the aid of their own views , and such as can not be distorted are suppressed . " " In every association with which I have had any connection , this fraud has been practised . " The like holds in political agitations . Unfortunately , agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become agencies maintained and worked in a considerable degree , and sometimes chiefly , for the benefit of those who reap incomes from them . An amusing instance of this was furnished , not many years ago , to a Member of Parliament who took an active part in advocating a certain radical measure which had for some years been making way , and which then seemed not unlikely to be carried . Being a member of the Association that had pushed forward this measure , he happened to step into its offices just before a debate which was expected to end in a majority for the bill , // and he found the secretary and his subs in a state of consternation at the prospect of their success : feeling , as they obviously did , that their occupation was in danger . Clearly , then , where personal interests come into play , there must be , even in men intending to be truthful , a great readiness to see the facts which it is convenient to see , and such reluctance to see opposite facts as will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large discount has mostly to be made from the evidence furnished by institutions and societies in justification of the policies they pursue or advocate . And since much of the evidence respecting both past and present social phenomena comes to us through agencies calculated thus to pervert it , there is here a further impediment to clear vision of facts . That the reader may fully appreciate the difficulties which these distorting influences , when combined , put in the way of getting good materials for generalization , let him contemplate a case . All who are acquainted with such matters know that up to some ten years since , it was habitually asserted by lecturers when addressing students , and by writers in medical journals , that in our day , syphilis is a far less serious evil than it was in days gone by . Until quite recently this was a commonplace statement , called in question by no one in the profession . But just as , while a decrease of drunkenness has been going on , Temperance-fanatics have raised an increasing outcry for strenuous measures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been diminishing in frequency and severity , certain instrumentalities and agencies have created a belief that rigorous measures are required to check its progress . This incongruity would by itself be a sufficient proof of the extent to which , on the one side or the other , evidence must have been vitiated . What , then , shall we say of the incongruity on finding that the first of these statements has recently been repeated by many of the highest medical authorities , as one verified by their experience ? Here are some of their testimonies . The Chairman of the late Government Commission for inquiring into the treatment and prevention of syphilis , Mr. // Skey , Consulting Surgeon to St. Bartholomew 's Hospital , gave evidence before a House of Lords ' Committee . Referring to an article expressing the views of the Association for promoting the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts , he said it was " largely overcharged , " and " coloured too highly . " " The disease is by no means so common or universal , I may say , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had an opportunity since I had the summons to appear here to-day of communicating with several leading members in the profession at the College of Surgeons , and we are all of the same opinion , that the evil is not so large by any means as it is represented by the association . " Mr. John Simon , F.R.S. , for thirty-five years a hospital surgeon , and now Medical Officer to the Privy Council , writes in his official capacity " I have not the least disposition to deny that venereal affections constitute a real and great evil for the community ; though I suspect that very exaggerated opinions are current as to their diffusion and malignity . " By the late Prof. Syme it was asserted that " It is now fully ascertained that the poison of the present day ( true syphilis ) does not give rise to the dreadful consequences which have been mentioned , when treated without mercury . . . . None of the serious effects that used to be so much dreaded ever appear , and even the trivial ones just noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude either that the virulence of the poison is worn out , or that the effects formerly attributed to it depended on treatment . " 3 The British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review , which stands far higher than any other medical journal , and is friendly to the Acts as applied to military and naval stations , writes thus : " The majority of those who have undergone the disease , thus far including secondary manifestations live as long as they could otherwise have expected to live , and die of diseases with which syphilis has no more to do than the man in the moon . " ? . . . " Surely 455 persons sufferirtg from true syphilis in one form or another , in a poor population of a million and a half less than 1 in 3000 . . . can not be held to be a proportion so large as to call for exceptional action on the part of any Government . " 6 Mr. Holmes Coote , F.R.C.S. , Surgeon and Lecturer on Surgery at St. Bartholomew 's Hospital , says ? // " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married women of the working class undergo are more trying to the health , and detrimental to the looks , than any of the irregularities of the harlot 's career . " Again , it is stated by Mr. Byrne , Surgeon to the Dublin Lock Hospital , that " there is not nearly so much syphilis as there used to be ; " and , after describing some of the serious results that were once common , he adds : ? " You will not see such a case for years ? a fact that no medical man can have failed to remark . " Mr. W. Burns Thompson , F.R.C.S. , for ten years head of the Edinburgh Dispensary , testifies as follows : " I have had good opportunities of knowing the prevailing diseases , and I can only say that the representations given by the advocates of these Acts are to me perfectly unintelligible ; they seem to me to be gross exaggerations . " Mr. Surgeon-Major Wyatt , of the Coldstream Guards , when examined by the Lords ' Committee , stated that he quite concurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The class of syphilitic diseases which we see are of a very mild character ; and , in fact , none of the ravages which used formerly to be committed on the appearance and aspect of the men are now to be seen . . . . It is an undoubted fact that in this country and in France the character of the disease is much diminished in intensity. ? Question 708 : I understand you to say , that in your opinion the venereal disease has generally , independent of the Act , become more mitigated , and of a milder type ? Answer : Yes ; that is the experience of all surgeons , both civil and military . " Dr. Druitt , President of the Association of the Medical Officers of Health for London , affirmed at one of its meet-ings " that , speaking from thirty-nine years ' experience , he was in a position to say that cases of syphilis in London were rare among the middle and better classes , and soon got over . " Even Mr. Acton , a specialist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due , admitted before the Lords ' Committee that " the disease is milder than it was formerly . " And then , most important of all , is the testimony of Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson , who is recognized as the highest authority on inherited syphilis , and to whose discoveries , indeed , // the identifications of syphilitic taint are mainly due . Though thus under a natural bias rather to over-estimate than underestimate the amount of inherited syphilis , Mr. Hutchinson , while editor of the British Medical Journal , wrote : " Although there is an impression to the contrary , yet recent discoveries and more accurate investigations , so far from extending the domain of syphilis as a cause of chronic disease , have decidedly tended to limit it . . . . although we have admitted as positively syphilitic certain maladies of a definite kind not formerly recognized , we have excluded a far larger number which were once under suspicion We can identify now the subject of severe hereditary taint by his teeth and physiognomy ; but those who believe most firmly in the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed by one in five thousand of our population.6 Like testimony is given by continental surgeons , among whom it was long ago said by Ambrose Pare , that the disease " is evidently becoming milder every day ; " and by Auzias Turenne , that " it is on the wane all over Europe . " Astruc and Diday concur in this statement . And the latest authority on syphilis , Lancereaux , whose work is so highly valued that it has been translated by the Sydenham Society , asserts that : " In these cases , which are far from being rare , syphilis is but an abortive disease ; slight and benignant , it does not leave behind any troublesome trace of its passage . It is impossible to lay too much stress upon this point . At the present day especially , when syphilis still inspires exaggerated fears , it should be known that this disease becomes dissipated completely in a great number of cases after the cessation of the cutaneous eruptions , and perhaps sometimes even with the primary lesion . " It will , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by their generally high position , or their lengthened experience , or their special experience , are so well qualified to judge , are selected testimonies ; and against them will be set the testimonies of Sir James Paget , Sir W. Jenner , and Mr. Prescott Hewett , who regard the evil as a very grave one . Possibly there will be quoted in reply an authoritative Statedocument , which , referring to the views of the three gentlemen just named as having " the emphatic concurrence of numerous practitioners , " says that they " are hardly answered by a few isolated opinions that the evil has been exaggerated " ? a // somewhat inadequate description of the above-quoted testimonies , considering not only the general weight of the names , but also the weight of sundry of them as those of specialists . To gather accurately the consensus of medical opinion would be impracticable without polling the whole body of physicians and surgeons ; but we have a means of judging which view most truly meets with " the emphatic concurrence of numerous practitioners " : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Out of fifty-eight physicians and surgeons residing in Nottingham and its suburbs , fifty-four have put their signatures to a public statement that syphilis is " very much diminished in frequency , and so much milder in form that we can scarcely recognize it as the disease described by our forefathers . " And among these are the medical men occupying nearly all the official medical positions in the town ? Senior Physician to the General Hospital , Honorary Surgeon ditto , Surgeons to the Jail , to the General Dispensary , to the Free Hospital , to the Union Hospital , to the Lock Hospital ( four in number ) , Medical Officers to the Board of Health , to the Union , to the County Asylum , &c.,; &c.; Even while I write there comes to me kindred evidence in the shape of a letter published in the British Medical Journal for 20th July , 1872 , by Dr. Carter , Honorary Physician to the Liverpool Southern Hospital , who states that , after several debates at the Liverpool Medical Institution , " a form of petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and . . . . in a few days one hundred and eight signatures of medical men were obtained . " Meanwhile , he adds , " earnest efforts were being made by a number of gentlemen to procure medical signatures to the petition in favour of the Acts known as the London Memorial , ' ? efforts which resulted in twenty-nine signatures only . " Yet notwithstanding this testimony , great in quantity and much of it of the highest quality , it has been possible so to present the evidence as to produce in the public mind , and in the Legislature , the impression that peremptory measures for dealing with a spreading pest are indispensable . As lately writes a Member of Parliament , ? " We were assured , on what appeared unexceptionable testimony , that a terrible constitutional disease was undermining the health and vigour of the // nation , and especially destroying innocent women and children . " And then note the startling circumstance that while so erroneous a conception of the facts may be spread abroad , there may , by the consequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unquestionable kind , established by the ever-accumulating experiences of successive generations . Until quite recently , our forms of judicial procedure embodied the principle that some overt injury must be committed before legal instrumentalities can be brought into play ; and conformity to this principle was in past times gradually brought about by efforts to avoid the terrific evils that otherwise arose . As a Professor of Jurisprudence reminds us , " the object of the whole complicated system of checks and guards provided by English law , and secured by a long train of constitutional conflicts , has been to prevent an innocent man being even momentarily treated as a thief , a murderer , or other criminal , on the mere alleged or real suspicion of a policeman . " Yet now , in the state of groundless fright that has been got up , " the concern hitherto exhibited by the Legislature for the personal liberty of the meanest citizen has been needlessly and recklessly lost sight of . " 8 It is an a priori inference from human nature that irresponsible power is sure , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The histories of all nations , through all times , teem with proofs that irresponsible power has been grossly abused . The growth of representative governments is the growth of arrangements made to prevent the gross abuse of irresponsible power . Each of our political struggles , ending in a further development of free institutions , has been made to put an end to some particular gross abuse of irresponsible power . Yet the facts thrust upon us by our daily experiences of men , verifying the experiences of the whole human race throughout the past , are now tacitly denied ; and it is tacitly asserted that irresponsible power will not be grossly abused . And all because of a manufactured panic about a decreasing disease , which kills not one-fifteenth of the number killed by scarlet fever , and which takes ten years to destroy as many as diarrhoea destroys in one year . See , then , what we have to guard against in collecting sociological data ? even data concerning the present , and , still // more , data concerning the past . For testimonies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , religious , judicial , physical , moral , &c.,; and respecting the actions of particular causes on those social states , have been liable to perversions not simply as great , but greater ; since while the regard for truth was less , there was more readiness to accept unproved statements . Even where deliberate measures are taken to obtain valid evidence on any political or social question raised , by summoning witnesses of all classes and interests , there is difficulty in getting at the truth ; because the circumstances of the inquiry tend of themselves to bring into sight some kinds of evidence , and to keep out of sight other kinds . In illustration may be quoted the following statement of Lord Lincoln on making his motion concerning the enclosures of commons : " This I know , that in nineteen cases out of twenty , committees sitting in this House on private bills neglected the rights of the poor . I do not say that they wilfully neglected those rights ? far from it ; but this I affirm , that they were neglected in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of the poor man , because by reason of his very poverty he is unable to come up to London to fee counsel , to procure witnesses , and to urge his claims before a committee of this House . " ? Hansard , 1 May , 1845 .9 Many influences of a different order , but similarly tending to exclude particular classes of facts pertinent to an inquiry , come into play . Given a question at issue , and it will very probably happen that witnesses on the one side may , by evidence of a certain nature , endanger a system on which they depend for the whole or for part of their livelihood ; and by evidence of an opposite nature may preserve it . By one kind of testimony they may offend their superiors and risk their promotion : doing the reverse by another kind . Moreover , witnesses not thus directly interested are liable to be indirectly swayed by the thought that to name certain facts they know will bring on them the ill-will of important persons in their locality ? a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly tend to bring out evidence , say in support of some established organization , there may very // possibly , and , indeed , very probably , be no organized adverse interest with abundant resources which busies itself to bring out a contrary class of facts ? no occupation in danger , no promotion to be had , no applause to be gained , no odium to be escaped . The reverse may happen : there may be positive sacrifices serious in amount to be made before such contrary class of facts can be brought to light . And thus it may result that , perfectly open and fair as the inquiry seems , the circumstances will insure a one-sided representation . A familiar optical illusion well illustrates the nature of these illusions which often deceive sociological inquirers . When standing by a lake-side in the moonlight , you see stretching over the rippled surface towards the moon , a bar of light which , as shown by its nearer part , consists of flashes from the sides of separate wavelets . You walk , and the bar of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the educated classes , many who suppose that this bar of light has an objective existence , and who believe that it really moves as the observer moves ? occasionally , indeed , as I can testify , expressing surprise at the fact . But , apart from the observer there exists no such bar of light ; nor when the observer moves is there any movement of this line of glittering wavelets . All over the dark part of the surface the undulations are just as bright with moonlight as those he sees ; but the light reflected from them does not reach his eyes . Thus , though there seems to be a lighting of some wavelets and not of the rest , and though , as the observer moves , other wavelets seem to become lighted that were not lighted before , yet both these are utterly false seemings . The simple fact is , that his position in relation to certain wavelets brings into view their reflections of the moon 's light , while it keeps out of view the like reflections from all other wavelets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Habitually the relations of observers to the facts are such as make visible the special , and exceptional , and sensational , and leave invisible the common-place and uninteresting , which form the great body of the facts . And this , which is a general cause of deceptive appearances , is variously aided by those more special causes above indicated ; which conspire to make the media through which the facts are seen , // transparent in respect of some and opaque in respect of others . Again , very serious perversions of evidence result from the unconscious confounding of observation with inference . Everywhere , a fertile source of error is the putting down as something perceived what is really a conclusion drawn from something perceived ; and this is a more than usually fertile source of error in Sociology . Here is an instance . A few years ago Dr. Stark published the results of comparisons he had made between the rates of mortality among the married and among the celibate : showing , as it seemed , the greater healthfulness of married life . Some criticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has been since referred to as having conclusively proved the alleged relation . More recently I have seen quoted from the Medical Press and Circular , the following summary of results supposed to tell the same tale " M. Bertillon has made a communication on this subject ( The Influence of Marriage ' ) to the Brussels Academy of Medicine , which has been published in the Revue Scientifique . From 25 to 30 years of age the mortality per 1000 in France amounts to 6.2 in married men , 10.2 in bachelors , and 21.8 in widows . In Brussels the mortality of married women is 9 per 1000 , girls the same , and widows as high as 16.9 . In Belgium from 7 per 1000 among married men , the number rises to 8.5 in bachelors , and 24.6 in widows . The proportion is the same in Holland . From 8.2 in married men , it rises to 11.7 in bachelors , and 16.9 in widowers , or 12.8 among married women , 8.5 in spinsters , and 13.8 in widows . The result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age the mortality per 1000 is 4 in married men , 10.4 in bachelors , and 22 in widows . This beneficial influence of marriage is manifested at all ages , being always more strongly marked in men than in women . " I will not dwell on the fallacy of the above conclusions as referring to the relative mortality of widows ? a fallacy sufficiently obvious to any one who thinks awhile . I will confine myself to the less-conspicuous fallacy in the comparison between the mortalities of married and celibate , fallen into by M. Bertillon as well as by Dr. Stark . Clearly as their figures seem to furnish proof of some direct causal relation between // marriage and longevity , they really furnish no proof whatever . There may be such a relation ; but the evidence assigned forms no warrant for inferring it . We have but to consider the circumstances which in many cases determine marriage , and those which in other cases prevent marriage , to see that the connexion which the figures apparently imply is not the real connexion . Where attachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage ? The possession of adequate means . Though some improvidently marry without means , yet it is undeniable that in many instances marriage is delayed by the man , or forbidden by the parents , or not assented to by the woman , until there is reasonable evidence of ability to meet the responsibilities . Now of men whose marriages depend on getting the needful incomes , which are the most likely to get the needful incomes ? The best , physically and mentally ? the strong , the intellectually capable , the morally well-balanced . Often bodily vigour achieves a success , and therefore a revenue , which bodily weakness , unable to bear the stress of competition , can not achieve . Often superior intelligence brings promotion and increase of salary , while stupidity lags behind in ill-paid posts . Often caution , self-control , and a far-seeing sacrifice of present to future , secure remunerative offices that are never given to the impulsive or the reckless . But what are the effects of bodily vigour , of intelligence , of prudence , on longevity ; when compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient self-control ? Obviously , the first further the maintenance of life , and the second tend towards premature death . That is , the qualities which , on the average of cases , give a man an advantage in gaining the means of marrying , are the qualities which make him likely to be a long-liver ; and conversely . There is even a more direct relation of the same general nature . In all creatures of high type , it is only when individual growth and development are nearly complete , that the production of new individuals becomes possible ; and the power of producing and bringing up new individuals , is measured by the amount of vital power in excess of that needful for self-maintenance . The reproductive instincts , and all their accompanying emotions , become dominant when the de86 THE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY . mands for individual evolution are diminishing , and there is arising a surplus of energy which makes possible the rearing of offspring as well as the preservation of self ; and , speaking generally , these instincts and emotions are strong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a large surplus of vital energy implies a good organization ? an organization likely to last long . So that , in fact , the superiority of physique which is accompanied by strength of the instincts and emotions causing marriage , is a superiority of physique also conducive to longevity . One further influence tells in the same direction . Marriage is not altogether determined by the desires of men ; it is determined in part by the preferences of women . Other things equal , women are attracted towards men of power ? physical , emotional , intellectual ; and obviously their freedom of choice leads them in many cases to refuse inferior samples of men : especially the malformed , the diseased , and those who are ill-developed , physically and mentally . So that , in so far as marriage is determined by female selection , the average result on men is that while the best easily get wives , a certain proportion of the worst are left without wives . This influence , therefore , joins in bringing into the ranks of married men those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those least likely to be long-lived . In three ways , then , does that superiority of organization which conduces to long life , also conduce to marriage . It is normally accompanied by a predominance of the instincts and emotions prompting marriage ; there goes along with it that power which can secure the means of making marriage practicable ; and it increases the probability of success in courtship . The figures given afford no proof that marriage and longevity are cause and consequence ; but they simply verify the inference which might be drawn a priori , that marriage and longevity are concomitant results of the same cause . This striking instance of the way in which inference may be mistaken for fact , will serve as a warning against another of the dangers that await us in dealing with sociological data . Statistics having shown that married men live longer than single men , it seems an irresistible implication that // married life is healthier than single life . And yet we see that the implication is not at all irresistible : though such a connexion may exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge , then , how difficult it must be , among social phenomena that have more entangled dependencies , to distinguish between the seeming relations and the real relations . Once more , we are liable to be led away by superficial , trivial facts , from the deep-seated and really-important facts they indicate . Always the details of social life , the interesting events , the curious things which serve for gossip , will , if we allow them , hide from us the vital connexions and the vital actions underneath . Every social phenomenon results from an immense aggregate of general and special causes ; and we may either take the phenomenon itself as intrinsically momentous , or may take it along with other phenomena , as indicating some inconspicuous truth of real significance . Let us contrast the two courses . Some months ago a correspondent of the Times , writing from Calcutta , said : " The Calcutta University examinations of any year would supply curious material for reflection on the value of our educational systems . The prose test in the entrance examination this year includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have picked up . The spelling is bad , but that I have not cared to give : " Question : ?

' The fact here drawn attention to as significant , is , that these Hindu youths , during their matriculation examination , be88 THE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY . trayed so much ignorance of the meaning of words and expressions contained in an English work they had read . And the intended implication appears to be that they were proved unfit to begin their college careers . If , now , instead of accepting that which is presented to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike us is the amazing folly of an examiner who proposes to test the fitness of youths for commencing their higher education , by seeing how much they know of the technical terms , cant-phrases , slang , and even extinct slang , talked by the people of another nation . Instead of the unfitness of the boys , which is pointed out to us , we may see rather the unfitness of those concerned in educating them . If , again , not dwelling on the particular fact underlying the one offered to our notice , we consider it along with others of the same class , our attention is arrested by the general fact that examiners , and especially those appointed under recent systems of administration , habitually put questions of which a large proportion are utterly inappropriate . As I learn from his son , one of our judges not long since found himself unable to answer an examination-paper that had been laid before law-students . A well-known Greek scholar , editor of a Greek play , who was appointed examiner , found that the examination-paper set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his inaugural address at St. Andrews , describing a paper set by an examiner in English history , said , " I could myself have answered two questions out of a dozen . " And I learn from Mr. G. H. Lewes that he could not give replies to the questions on English literature which the Civil Service examiners had put to his son . Joining which testimonies with kindred ones coming from students and professors on all sides , we find the really-noteworthy thing to be that examiners , instead of setting questions fit for students , set questions which make manifest their own extensive learning . Especially if they are young , and have reputations to make or to justify , they seize the occasion for displaying their erudition , regardless of the interests of those they examine . If we look through this more significant and general fact for the still deeper fact it grows out of , there arises before us the question ? Who examines the examiners ? How happens it that men competent in their special knowledge , but so inOBJECTIVE // competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? This prevailing faultiness of the examiners shows conclusively that the administration is faulty at its centre . Somewhere or other , the power of ultimate decision is exercised by those who are unfit to exercise it . If the examiners of the examiners were set to fill up an examination-paper which had for its subject the right conduct of examinations , and the proper qualifications for examiners , there would come out very unsatisfactory answers . Having seen through the small details and the wider facts down to these deeper facts , we may , on contemplating them , perceive that these , too , are not the deepest or most significant . It becomes clear that those having supreme authority suppose , as men in general do , that the sole essential thing for a teacher or examiner is complete knowledge of that which he has to teach , or respecting which he has to examine . Whereas a co-essential thing is a knowledge of Psychology ; and especially that part of Psychology which deals with the evolution of the faculties . Unless , either by special study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained an approximatelytrue conception of how minds perceive , and reflect , and generalize , and by what processes their ideas grow from concrete to abstract , and from simple to complex , no one is competent to give lessons that will effectually teach , or to ask questions which will effectually measure the efficiency of teaching . Further , it becomes manifest that , in common with the public , those in authority assume that the goodness of education is to be tested by the quantity of knowledge acquired . Whereas it is to be much more truly tested by the capacity for using knowledge ? by the extent to which the knowledge gained has been turned into faculty , so as to be available both for the purposes of life and for the purposes of independent investigation . Though there is a growing consciousness that a mass of unorganized information is , after all , of little value , and that there is more value in less information well-organized , yet the significant truth is that this consciousness has not got itself officially embodied ; and that our educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in pursuance of a crude and out-worn belief . As here , then , so in other cases meeting us in the present // and all through the past , we have to contend with the difficulty that the greater part of the evidence supplied to us as of chief interest and importance , is of value only for what it indicates . We have to resist the temptation to dwell on those trivialities which make up nine-tenths of our records and histories ; and which are worthy of attention solely because of the things they indirectly imply or the things tacitly asserted along with them . Beyond those vitiations of evidence due to random observations , to the subjective states of the observers , to their enthusiasms , or preposessions , or self-interests ? beyond those arising from the general tendency to set down as a fact observed what is really an inference from an observation , and also those arising from the general tendency to admit the dissection by which small surface results are traced to large interior causes ; there come those vitiations of evidence consequent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moral , religious , commercial , &c.,; may be the phenomena we have to consider , a society presents them in so diffused and multitudinous a way , and under such various relations to us , that the conceptions we can frame are at best extremely inadequate . Consider how impossible it is truly to conceive so relatively-simple a thing as the territory which a society covers . Even by the aid of maps , geographical and geological , slowly elaborated by multitudes of surveyors ? even by the aid of descriptions of towns , counties , mountainous and rural districts ? even by the aid of such personal examinations as we have made here and there in journeys during life ; we can reach nothing approaching to a true idea of the actual surface ? arable , grass-covered , wooded ; flat , undulating , rocky ; drained by rills , brooks , and slow rivers ; sprinkled with cottages , farms , villas , cities . Imagination simply rambles hither and thither , and fails utterly to frame an adequate thought of the whole . How then shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of an intellectual state , of a commercial activity , pervading this territory ; unaided by maps , and aided only by the careless statements of careless observers a Respecting most of the phenomena , as displayed by a nation // at large , only dim apprehensions are possible ; and how untrustworthy they are , is shown by every parliamentary debate , by every day 's newspapers , and by every evening 's conversations ; which severally disclose quite conflicting estimates . See how various are the statements made respecting any nation in its character and actions by each traveller visiting it . There is a story , apt if not true , of a Frenchman who , having been three weeks here , proposed to write a book on England ; who , after three months , found that he was not quite ready ; and who , after three years , concluded that he knew nothing about it . And every one who looks back and compares his early impressions respecting states of things in his own society with the impressions he now has , will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how probable it is that even his revised beliefs are but partially true . On remembering how wrong he was in his pre-conceptions of the people and the life in some unvisited part of the kingdom ? on remembering how different from those he had imagined , were the characters he actually found in certain alien classes and along with certain alien creeds ; he will see how greatly this wide diffusion of social facts impedes true appreciation of them . Moreover , there are illusions consequent on what we may call moral perspective , which we do not habitually correct in thought , as we correct in perception the illusions of physical perspective . A small object close to , occupies a larger visual area than a mountain afar off ; but here our well-organized experiences enable us instantly to rectify a false inference suggested by the subtended angles . No such prompt rectification for the perspective is made in sociological observations . A small event next door , producing a larger impression than a great event in another country , is over-estimated . Conclusions prematurely drawn from social experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear proofs that elsewhere wider social experiences point to opposite conclusions . A further great difficulty to which we are thus introduced is , that the comparisons by which alone we can finally establish relations of cause and effect among social phenomena , can rarely be made between cases in all respects fit for comparison . // Every society differs specifically , if not generically , from every other . Hence it is a peculiarity of the Social Science that parallels drawn between different societies , do not afford grounds for decided conclusions ? will not , for instance , show us with certainty , what is an essential phenomenon in a given society and what is a non-essential one . Biology deals with numerous individuals of a species , and with many species of a genus , and by comparing them can see what traits are specifically constant and what generically constant ; and the like holds more or less with the other concrete sciences . But comparisons between societies , among which we may almost say that each individual is a species by itself , yield much less definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the accidental characters . So that even supposing we have perfectly-valid data for our sociological generalizations , there still lies before us the difficulty that these data are , in many cases , so multitudinous and diffused that we can not adequately consolidate them into true conceptions ; the additional difficulty that the moral perspective under which they are presented , can scarcely ever be so allowed for as to secure true ideas of proportions ; and the further difficulty that comparisons of our vague and incorrect conceptions concerning one society with our kindred conceptions concerning another society , have always to be taken with the qualification that the comparisons are only partially justifiable , because the compared things are only partially alike in their other traits . An objective difficulty , even greater still , which the Social Science presents , arises from the distribution of its facts in Time . Those who look on a society as either supernaturally created or created by Acts of Parliament , and who consequently consider successive stages of its existence as having no necessary dependence on one another , will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consciousness of the slow genesis of social phenomena . But those who have risen to the belief that societies are evolved in structure and function , as in growth , will be made to hesitate on contemplating the long unfolding through which early causes work out late results . // Even true appreciation of the successive facts which an individual life presents , is generally hindered by inability to grasp the gradual processes by which ultimate effects are produced ; as we may see in the foolish mother who , yielding to her perverse child , gains the immediate benefit of peace , and can not foresee the evil of chronic dissension which her policy will hereafter bring about . And in the life of a nation , which , if of high type , lasts at least a hundred individual lives , correct estimation of results is still more hindered by this immense duration of the actions through which antecedents bring their consequents . In judging of political good and evil , the average legislator thinks much after the manner of the mother dealing with the spoiled child : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered sufficient justification . Quite recently an inquiry has been made into the results of an administration which had been in action some five years only , with the tacit assumption that supposing the results were proved good , the administration would be justified . And yet to those who look into the records of the past not to revel in narratives of battles or to gloat over court-scandals , but to find how institutions and laws have arisen and how they have worked , there is no truth more obvious than that generation after generation must pass before the outcome of an action that has been set up can be seen . Take the example furnished us by our Poor Laws , When villeinage had passed away and serfs were no longer maintained by their owners ? when , in the absence of any one to control and take care of serfs , there arose an increasing class of mendicants and " sturdy rogues , preferring robbery to labour " ? when , in Richard the Second 's time , authority over such was given to justices and sheriffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , labourers , and beggars , to their respective localities ? when , to meet the case of beggars , " impotent to serve , " the people of the districts in which they were found , were made in some measure responsible for them ( so re-introducing in a more general form the feudal arrangement of attachment to the soil , and reciprocal claim on the soil ) ; it was not suspected that the foundations were laid for a system which would , in after times , bring about a demoralization threatening general ruin . When , in subsequent centuries , to meet // the evils of again-increasing vagrancy which punishment failed to repress , these measures , re-enacted with modifications , ended in making the people of each parish chargeable with the maintenance of their poor , while it re-established the severest penalties on vagabondage , even to death without benefit of clergy , no one ever anticipated that while the penal elements of this legislation would by and by become so modified as to have little practical effect in checking idleness , the accompanying arrangements would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither legislators nor others foresaw that in 230 years the poor's-rate , having grown to seven millions , would become a public spoil of which we read that " The ignorant believed it an inexhaustible fund which belonged to them . To obtain their share the brutal bullied the administrators , the profligate exhibited their bastards which must be fed , the idle folded their arms and waited till they got it ; ignorant boys and girls married upon it ; poachers , thieves , and prostitutes , extorted it by intimidation ; country justices lavished it for popularity , and guardians for convenience . . . . Better men sank down among the worse : the rate-paying cottager , after a vain struggle , went to the pay-table to seek relief ; the modest girl might starve while her bolder neighbour received Is. 6d. per week for every illegitimate child . " As sequences of the law of Elizabeth , no one imagined that , in rural districts , farmers , becoming chief administrators , would pay part of their men 's wages out of the rates ( so taxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields ) ; and that this abnormal relation of master and man would entail bad cultivation . No one imagined that , to escape poor's-rates , landlords would ' avoid building cottages , and would even clear cottages away : so causing over-crowding , with consequent evils , bodily and mental . No one imagined that workhouses , so called , would become places for idling in ; and places where married couples would display their " elective affinities " time after time.10 Yet these , and detrimental results which it would take pages to enumerate , culminating in that general result most detrimental of all ? helping the worthless to multiply at the expense of the worthy ? finally came out of measures taken out ages ago merely to mitigate certain immediate evils . // Is it not obvious , then , that only in the course of those long periods required to mould national characters and habits and sentiments , will the truly-important results of a public policy show themselves ? Let us consider the question a little further . In a society living , growing , changing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less the direction of movement determined by the aggregate of forces . Never simple and direct , but , by the co-operation of so many causes , made irregular , involved , and always rhythmical , the course of social change can not be judged of in its general direction by inspecting any small portion of it . Each action will inevitably be followed , after a while , by some direct or indirect reaction , and this again by a re-action ; and until the successive effects have shown themselves , no one can say how the total motion will be modified . You must compare positions at great distances from one another in time , before you can tell rightly whither things are tending . Even so simple a thing as a curve of single curvature can not have its nature perceived unless there is a considerable length of it . See here these five points close together . The curve passing through them may be a circle , an ellipse , a parabola , an hyperbola . Let the points be further apart , and it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve ? it is obviously not a circle . Let them , or some of them , be more remote still , and it may be seen that if not an infinite curve it must be a highly eccentric ellipse . And when the points are at relatively great distances , the mathematician can say with certainty what conic section alone will pass through them all . Surely , then , in such complex and slowly-evolving movements as those of a nation 's life , all the smaller and greater rhythms of which fall within certain general directions , it is impossible that such general directions can be traced by looking at stages that are close together ? it is impossible that the effect wrought on any general direction by some additional force , can be truly computed from observations extending over but a few years , or but a few generations . For , in the case of these most-involved of all movements , there is the difficulty , paralleled in no other movements ( being only approached in those of individual evolution ) , that each // new factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement , modifies it also in a remote way , by changing the amounts and directions of all other factors . A fresh influence brought into play on a society , not only affects its members directly in their acts , but also indirectly in their characters . Continuing to work on their characters generation after generation , and altering by inheritance the feelings which they bring into social life at large , this influence alters the intensities and bearings of all other influences throughout the society . By slowly initiating modifications of nature , it brings into play forces of many kinds , incalculable in their strengths and tendencies , that act without regard to the original influence , and may cause quite opposite effects . Fully to exhibit this objective difficulty , and to show more clearly still how important it is to take as data for sociological conclusions , not the brief sequences , but the sequences that extend over centuries or are traceable throughout civilization , let us draw a lesson from a trait which all regulative agencies in all nations have displayed . The original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clear on finding that where cannibalism is still rampant , and where the largest consumers of human flesh are the chiefs , these chiefs , undergoing apotheosis when they die , are believed thereafter to feed on the souls of the departed ? the souls being regarded as duplicates equally material with the bodies they belong to . And should any doubt remain , it must be dissipated by the accounts we have of the ancient Mexicans , whose priests , when war had not lately furnished a victim , complained to the king that the god was hungry ; and who , when a victim was sacrificed , offered his heart to the idol ( bathing its lips with his blood , and even putting portions of the heart into his mouth ) and then cooked and ate the rest of the body themselves . Here the fact to which attention is drawn , and which various civilizations show us , is that the sacrificing of prisoners or others , once a general usage among cannibal ancestry , continues as an ecclesiastical usage long after having died out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely allied with this fact , have like general implications . Cutting implements of stone remain in // use for sacrificial purposes when implements of bronze , and even of iron , are used for all other purposes : the Hebrews are commanded in Deuteronomy to build altars of stone without using iron tools ; the high priest of Jupiter at Rome was shaved with a bronze knife . Further , the primitive method of obtaining fire by the friction of pieces of wood , survives in religious ceremonies ages after its abandonment in the household ; and even now , among the Hindus , the flame for the altar is kindled by the " fire drill . " These are striking instances of the pertinacity with which the oldest part of the regulative organization maintains its original traits in the teeth of influences that modify things around it . The like holds in respect of the language , spoken and written , which it employs . Among the Egyptians the most ancient form of hieroglyphics was retained for sacred records , when more developed forms were adopted for other purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews , and the continued use of Latin for the Roman Catholic service , show us how strong this tendency is , apart from the particular creed . Among ourselves , too , a less dominant ecclesiasticism exhibits a kindred trait . The English of the Bible is of an older style than the English of the date at which the translation was made ; and in the church service various words retain obsolete meanings , and others are pronounced in obsolete ways . Even the typography , with its illuminated letters of the rubric , shows traces of the same tendency ; while Puseyites and ritualists , aiming to reinforce ecclesiasticism , betray a decided leaning towards archaic print , as well as archaic ornaments . In the a ? sthetic direction , indeed , their movement has brought back the most primitive type of sculpture for monumental purposes ; as may be seen in Canterbury Cathedral , where , in two new monuments to ecclesiastics , one being Archbishop Sumner , the robed figures recline on their backs , with hands joined , after the manner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude , which is a distinctive trait of barbaric art , as shown by every child 's drawing of a man and every idol carved by a savage . A conscious as well as an unconscious adhesion to the old in usage and doctrine is shown . Not only among Roman // Catholics but among many Protestants , to ascertain what the Fathers said , is to ascertain what should be believed . In the pending controversy about the Athanasian Creed , we see how much authority attaches to an antique document . The antagonism between Convocation and the lay members of the Church ? the one as a body wishing to retain the cursing clauses and the other to exclude them ? further shows that official Protestantism adheres to antiquity much more than non-official Protestantism : a contrast equally displayed not long since between the opinions of the lay part and the clerical part of the Protestant Irish Church . Throughout political organizations the like tendency , though less dominant , is very strong . The gradual establishment of law by the consolidation of custom , is the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , regarded under its most general aspect as the agency which maintains a permanent order , it is in the very nature of a State-organization to be relatively rigid . The way in which primitive principles and practices , no longer fully in force among individuals ruled , survive in the actions of ruling agents , is curiously illustrated by the long retention between nobles of a right of feud after it had been disallowed between citizens . Chief vassals , too , retained this power to secure justice for themselves after smaller vassals lost it : not only was a right of war with one another recognized , but also a right of defence against the king . And we see that even now , in the dealings between Governments , armed force to remedy injuries is still employed , as it originally was between all individuals . As bearing in the same direction , it is significant that the right of trial by battle , which was a regulated form of the aboriginal system under which men administered justice in their own cases , survived among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even on behalf of religious communities judicial duels were fought . Here the thing it concerns us to note is that the system of fighting in person and fighting by deputy , when no longer otherwise lawful , was retained , actually or formally , in various parts of the regulative organization . Up to the reign of George III. , trial by battle could be claimed as an alternative of trial by jury . Duels continued till quite recently between members of // the ruling classes , and especially between officers ; and even now in Continental armies duelling is not only recognized as proper , but is , in some cases , imperative . And then , showing most strikingly how these oldest usages survive longest , in connexion with the oldest part of the governing organization , we have had in the coronation ceremony , up to modern times , a champion in armour uttering by herald a challenge to all corners on behalf of the monarch . If , from the agencies by which law is enforced , we pass to legal forms , language , documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is retained for lawdeeds though paper has replaced it for other purposes . The form of writing is an old form . Latin and Norman-French terms are still in use for legal purposes , though not otherwise in use ; and even old English words , such as " seize , " retain in Law , meanings which they have lost in current speech . In the execution of documents , too , the same truth is illustrated ; for the seal , which was originally the signature , continues , though the written signature now practically replaces it ? nay , we retain a symbol of the symbol , as may be seen in every share transfer , where there is a paper-wafer to represent the seal . Even still more antique usages survive in legal transactions ; as in the form extant in Scotland of handing over a portion of rock when an estate is sold , which evidently answers to the ceremony among the ancient nations of sending earth and water as a sign of yielding territory . From the working of State-departments , too , many kindred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national safety , the flint-lock for muskets was but tardily replaced by the percussion-lock ; and the rifle had been commonly in use for sporting purposes generations before it came into more than sparing use for military purposes . Book-keeping by double entry had long been permanently established in the mercantile world before it superseded book-keeping by single entry in Government offices : its adoption dating back only to 1834 , when a still more antique system of keeping accounts by notches cut on sticks , was put an end to by the conflagration that resulted from the burning of the Exchequer-tallies. // The like holds with apparel , in general and in detail . Cocked hats are yet to be seen on the heads of officers . An extinct form of dress still holds its ground as the Court-dress ; and the sword once habitually worn by gentlemen has become the dress-sword worn only on State-occasions . Everywhere officialism has its established uniforms , which may be traced back to old fashions that have disappeared from ordinary life . Some of these antique articles of costume we see surmounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang round the necks of the clergy ; and others which linger on the legs of bishops . Thus , from the use of a flint-knife by the Jews for the religious ceremony of circumcision , down to the pronunciation of the terminal syllable of the preterite in our Church-service , down to the oyez shouted in a law-court to secure attention , down to the retention of epaulets for officers , and down to the Norman-French words in which the royal assent is given , this persistence is everywhere traceable . And when we find this persistence displayed through all ages in all departments of the regulative organization , ? when we see it to be the natural accompaniment of the function of that organization , which is essentially restraining ? when we estimate the future action of the organization in any case , by observing the general sweep of its curve throughout long periods of the past ; we shall see how misleading may be the conclusions drawn from recent facts taken by themselves . Where the regulative organization is anywhere made to undertake additional functions , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the desired kind ; but we shall suspect that after the phase of early activity has passed by , the plasticity of the new structure will rapidly diminish , the characteristic tendency towards rigidity will show itself , and in place of expansive effect there will come a restrictive effect . The reader will now understand more clearly the meaning of the assertion that true conceptions of sociological changes are to be reached only by contemplating their slow genesis through centuries , and that basing inferences on results shown in short periods , is as illusory as would be judging of the Earth 's curvature by observing whether we are walking up or down hill . After recognizing which truth he will perceive // how great is another of the obstacles in the way of the Social Science . " But does not all this prove too much ? If it is so difficult to get sociological evidence that is not vitiated by the subjective states of the witnesses , by their prejudices , enthusiasms , interests , &c.?if; where there is impartial examination , the conditions to the inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is so general a proneness to assert as facts observed what were really inferences from observations , and so great a tendency also to be blinded by exterior trivialities to interior essentials ? if even where accurate data are accessible , their multitudinousness and diffusion in Space make it impracticable clearly to grasp them as wholes , while their unfolding in Time is so slow that antecedents and consequents can not be mentally represented in their true relations ; is it not manifestly impossible that a Social Science can be framed ? " It must be admitted that the array of objective difficulties thus brought together is formidable ; and were it the aim of the Social Science to draw quite special and definite conclusions , which must depend for their truth upon exact data accurately co-ordinated , it would obviously have to be abandoned . But there are certain classes of general facts which remain after all errors in detail , however produced , have been allowed for . Whatever conflicts there may be among accounts of events that occurred during feudal ages , comparison of them brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By their implications , chronicles and laws indicate the traits of this system ; and on putting side by side narratives and documents written , not to tell us about the Feudal System but for quite other purposes , we get tolerably clear ideas of these traits in their essentials ? ideas made clearer still on collating the evidence furnished by different contemporary societies . Similarly throughout . By making due use not so much of that which past and present witnesses intend to tell us , as of that which they tell us by implication , it is possible to collect data for inductions respecting social structures and functions in their origin and development : the obstacles which arise in the disentangling of such data in the case of // any particular society , being mostly surmountable by the help of the comparative method . Nevertheless , the difficulties above enumerated must be ever present to us . Throughout , we have to depend on testimony ; and in every case we have to beware of the many modes in which evidence may be vitiated ? have to estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and have to take care that our conclusions do not depend on any particular class of facts gathered from any particular place or time . CHAPTER VI . SUBJECTIVE **25;29;TOOLONG . IF you watch the management of a child by a mother of small capacity , you may be struck by the inability she betrays to imagine the child 's thoughts and feelings . Full of energy which he must expend in some way , and eager to see everything , her little boy is every moment provoking her by his restlessness . The occasion is perhaps a railway journey . Now he strives to look out of the window ; and now , when forbidden to do that , climbs on the seats , or meddles with the small luggage . " Sit still , " " Get down , I tell you , " " Why ca n't you be quiet ? " are the commands and expostulations she utters from minute to minute ? partly , no doubt , to prevent the discomfort of fellow-passengers . But , as you will see at times when no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish activities mainly out of regard for what she thinks propriety , and does it without any adequate recognition of the penalties she inflicts . Though she herself lived through this phase of extreme curiosity ? this early time when almost every object passed has the charm of novelty , and when the overflowing energies generate a painful irritation if pent up ; yet now she can not believe how keen is the desire for seeing which she balks , and how difficult is the maintenance of that quietude on which she insists . Conceiving her child 's consciousness in terms of her own consciousness , and feeling how easy it is to sit still and not look out of the window , she ascribes his behaviour to mere perversity . I recall this and kindred cases to the reader 's mind , for the purpose of exemplifying a necessity and a difficulty . The necessity is that in dealing with other beings and interpreting their actions , we must represent their thoughts and feelings in 103 // terms of our own . The difficulty is that in so representing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frequently very wrong . The conception which any one frames of another 's mind , is inevitably more or less after the pattern of his own mind ? is automorphic ; and in proportion as the mind of which he has to frame a conception differs from his own , his automorphic interpretation is likely to be wide of the truth . That measuring other person 's actions by the standards our own thoughts and feelings furnish , often causes misconstruction , is a remark familiar even to the vulgar . But while among members of the same society , having natures nearly akin , it is seen that automorphic explanations are often erroneous , it is not seen with due clearness how much more erroneous such explanations commonly are , when the actions are those of men of another race , to whom the kinship in nature is comparatively remote . We do , indeed , perceive this , if the interpretations are not our own ; and if both the interpreters and the interpreted are mentally alien to us . When , as in early English literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the heroes of antiquity spoken of as princesses , knights , and squires , it becomes clear that the ideas concerning ancient civilization must have been utterly wrong . When we find Virgil named in religious stories of the middle ages as one among the prophets who visited the cradle of Christ ? when an illustrated psalter gives scenes from the life of Christ in which there repeatedly figures a castle with a portcullis ? when even the crucifixion is described by Langland in the language of chivalry , so that the man who pierced Christ 's side with a spear is considered as a knight who disgraced his knighthood ' ? when we read of the Crusaders calling themselves " vassals of Christ ; " we need no further proof that by carrying their own sentiments and ideas to the interpretation of social arrangements and transactions among the Jews , our ancestors were led into absurd misconceptions . But we do not recognize the fact that in virtue of the same tendency , we are ever framing conceptions which , if not so grotesquely untrue , are yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine mental states remote from our own so correctly that we can understand how they issue in // individual actions , and consequently in social actions , an instance will make manifest . The feeling of vague wonder with which he received his first lessons in the Greek mythology , will most likely be dimly remembered by every reader . If not in words , still inarticulately , there passed through him the thought that faith in such stories was unaccountable . When , afterwards , he read in books of travels details of the amazing superstitions of savages , there was joined with a sense of the absurdity of these superstitions , much astonishment at their acceptance by any human beings , however ignorant or stupid . Such beliefs as that the people of a neighbouring tribe had descended from ducks , that rain fell when certain deities began to spit on the Earth , that the island lived upon had been pulled up from the bottom of the ocean by one of their gods , whose hook got fast when he was fishing ? these , and countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insanity . He interpreted them automorphically ? carrying with him not simply his own faculties developed to a stage of complexity considerably beyond that reached by the faculties of the savage , but also the modes of thinking in which he was brought up , and the stock of information he had acquired . Probably it has never since occurred to him to do otherwise . Even if he now attempts to see things from the savage 's point of view , he most likely fails entirely ; and if he succeeds at all , it is but partially . Yet only by seeing things as the savage sees them can his ideas be understood , his behaviour accounted for , and the resulting social phenomena explained . These apparently-strange superstitions are quite natural ? quite rational , in a certain sense , in their respective times and places . The laws of intellectual action are the same for civilized and uncivilized . The difference between civilized and uncivilized is in complexity of faculty and in amount of knowledge accumulated and generalized . Given , reflective powers developed only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboriginal man ? given , his small stock of ideas , collected in a narrow area of space , and not added to by records extending through time ? given , his impulsive nature incapable of patient inquiry ; and these seemingly-monstrous stories of his become in reality the most feasible explanations he can find of // surrounding things . Yet even after concluding that this must be so , it is not easy to think from the savage 's standpoint , clearly enough to follow the effects of his ideas on his acts , through all the relations of life , social and other . A parallel difficulty stands in the way of rightly conceiving character remote from our own , so as to see how it issues in conduct . We may best recognize our inability in this respect , by observing the converse inability of other races to understand our characters , and the acts they prompt . " Wonderful are the works of Allah ! Behold ! That Frank is trudging about when he can , if he pleases , sit still ! " 2 In like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the same place to stretch my legs , they Somali formed councils of war on my motives , considering I must have some secret designs upon their country , or I would not do it , as no man in his senses could be guilty of working his legs unnecessarily . " 3 But while , by instances like these , we are shown that our characters are in a large measure incomprehensible by races remote in nature from us , the correlative fact that we can not rightly conceive their sentiments and motives is one perpetually overlooked in our sociological interpretations . Feeling , for instance , how natural it is to take an easier course in place of a more laborious course , and to adopt new methods that are proved to be better methods , we are puzzled on finding the Chinese stick to their dim paper-lamps , though they admire our bright argand-lamps , which they do not use if given to them ; or on finding that the Hindus prefer their rough primitive tools , after seeing how our improved tools do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet more remote in civilization , we still oftener discover ourselves wrong when we suppose that under given conditions they will act as we should act . Here , then , is a subjective difficulty of a serious kind . To understand any fact in social evolution , we have to see it as resulting from the joint actions of individuals having certain natures . We can not so understand it without understanding their natures ; and this , even by care and effort , we are able to do but very imperfectly . Our interpretations must // be automorphic ; and yet automorphism perpetually misleads us . One would hardly suppose , a priori , that untruthfulness would habitually co-exist with credulity . Rather our inference might be that , because of the tendency above enlarged upon , people most given to making false statements must be people most inclined to suspect statements made by others . Yet , somewhat anomalously , as it seems , habitual veracity generally goes with inclination to doubt evidence ; and extreme untrustworthiness of assertion often has for its concomitant , readiness to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare savage with civilized , or compare the successive stages of civilization with one another , you find untruthfulness and credulity decreasing together ; until you reach the modern man of science , who is at once exact in his statements and critical respecting evidence . The converse relation to that seen in the man of science , is even now startlingly presented in the East , where greediness in swallowing fictions goes along with superfluous telling of falsehoods . An Egyptian prides himself in a clever lie , uttered perhaps without motive ; and a dyer will even ascribe the failure in fixing one of his colours to the not having been successful in a deception . Yet so great is the readiness to believe improbabilities , that Mr. St. John , in his Two Years ' Residence in a Levantine Family , narrates how , when the " Arabian Nights ' Entertainments " was being read aloud , and when he hinted that the stories must not be accepted as true , there arose a strong protest against such scepticism : the question being asked , ? " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ " ' I point out this union of seemingly-inconsistent traits , not because of the direct bearing it has on the argument , but because of its indirect bearing . For I have here to dwell on the misleading effects of certain mental states which similarly appears unlikely to co-exist , and which yet do habitually coexist . I refer to the belief which , even while I write , I find repeated in the leading journal , that " the deeper a student of history goes , the more does he find man the same in all time ; " and to the opposite belief embodied in current politics , that // human nature may be readily altered . These two beliefs , which ought to cancel one another but do not , originate two classes of errors in sociological speculation ; and nothing like correct conclusions in Sociology can be drawn until they have been rejected and replaced by a belief which reconciles them ? the belief that human nature is indefinitely modifiable , but that no modification of it can be brought about rapidly . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads . While it was held that the stars are fixed and that the hills are everlasting , there was a certain congruity in the notion that man continues unchanged from age to age ; but now when we know that all stars are in motion , and that there are no such things as everlasting hills ? now when we find all things throughout the Universe to be in a ceaseless flux , it is time for this crude conception of human nature to disappear out of our social conceptions ; or rather ? it is time for its disappearance to be followed by that of the many narrow notions respecting the past and the future of society , which have grown out of it , and which linger notwithstanding the loss of their root . For , avowedly by some and tacitly by others , it continues to be thought that the human heart is as " desperately wicked " as it ever was , and that the state of society hereafter will be very much like the state of society now . If , when the evidence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission that aboriginal man , of troglodyte or kindred habits , differed somewhat from man as he was during feudal times , and that the customs and sentiments and beliefs he had in feudal times , imply a character appreciably unlike that which he has now ? if , joined with this , there is a recognition of the truth that along with these changes in man there have gone still more conspicuous changes in society ; there is , nevertheless , an ignoring of the implication that hereafter man and society will continue to change , until they have diverged as widely from their existing types as their existing types have diverged from those of the earliest recorded ages . It is true that among the more cultured the probability , or even the certainty , that such transformations will go on , may be granted ; but the granting is but nominal ? the admission does not become a factor in the conclusions drawn . The first discussion on a political or social topic , reveals the tacit // assumption that , in times to come , society will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , the question of domestic service is raised , it mostly happens that its bearings are considered wholly in reference to those social arrangements which exist around us : only a few proceed on the supposition that these arrangements are probably but transitory . It is so throughout . Be the subject industrial organization , or class-relations , or rule by fashion , the thought which practically moulds the conclusions , if not the thought theoretically professed , is , that whatever changes they may undergo , our institutions will not cease to be recognizably the same . Even those who have , as they think , deliberately freed themselves from this perverting tendency ? even M. Comte and his disciples , believing in an entire transformation of society , nevertheless betray an incomplete emancipation ; for the ideal society expected by them , is one under regulation by a hierarchy essentially akin to hierarchies such as mankind have known . So that everywhere sociological thinking is more or less impeded by the difficulty of bearing in mind that the social states towards which our race is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our present social state was conceivable by a Norse pirate and his followers . Note , now , the opposite difficulty , which appears to be surmountable by scarcely any of our parties , political or philanthropic , ? the difficulty of understanding that human nature , though indefinitely modifiable , can be modified but very slowly ; and that all laws and institutions and appliances which count on getting from it , within a short time , much better results than present ones , will inevitably fail . If we glance over the programmes of societies , and sects , and schools of all kinds , from Rousseau 's disciples in the French Convention up to the members of the United Kingdom Alliance , from the adherents of the Ultramontane propaganda up to the enthusiastic advocates of an education . exclusively secular , we find in them one common trait . They are all pervaded by the conviction , now definitely expressed and now taken as a self-evident truth , that there needs but this kind of instruction or that kind of discipline , this mode of repression or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better state . Here we read that " it is necessary completely // to re-fashion the people whom one wishes to make free " : the implication being that a re-fashioning is practicable . There it is taken as undeniable that when you have taught children what they ought to do to be good citizens , they will become good citizens . Elsewhere it is held to be a truth beyond question , that if by law temptations to drink are removed from men , they will not only cease to drink , but thereafter cease to commit crimes . And yet the delusiveness of all such hopes is obvious enough to any one not blinded by a hypothesis , or carried away by an enthusiasm . The fact , often pointed out to temperance-fanatics , that some of the soberest nations in Europe yield a proportion of crime higher than our own , might suffice to show them that England would not be suddenly moralized if they carried their proposed restrictions into effect . The superstition that good behaviour is to be forthwith produced by lessons learnt out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , but for preconceptions , be utterly dissipated by observing to what a slight extent knowledge affects conduct ? by observing that the dishonesty implied in the adulterations of tradesmen and manufacturers , in fraudulent bankruptcies , in bubblecompanies , in " cooking " of railway accounts and financial prospectuses , differs only in form , and not in amount , from the dishonesty of the uneducated ? by observing how amazingly little the teachings given to medical students affect their lives , and how even the most experienced medical men have their prudence scarcely at all increased by their information . Similarly , the Utopian ideas which come out afresh along with every new political scheme , from the " paper-constitutions " of the Abbe Sieyes down to the lately-published programme of M. Louis Blanc , and from agitations for voteby-ballot up to those which have a Republic for their aim , might , but for this tacit belief we are contemplating , be extinguished by the facts perpetually and startlingly thrust on our attention . Again and again for three generations has France been showing to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social structure by any rearrangement wrought out through a revolution . However great the transformation may for a time seem , the original thing re-appears in disguise . Out of the nominally-free // government set up a new despotism arises , differing from the old by having a new shibboleth and new men to utter it ; but identical with the old in the determination to put down opposition and in the means used to this end . Liberty , when obtained , is forthwith surrendered to an avowed autocrat ; or , as we have seen within this year , is allowed to lapse into the hands of one who claims the reality of autocracy without its title . Nay , the change is , in fact , even less ; for the regulative organization which ramifies throughout French society , continues unaltered by these changes at the governmental centre . The bureaucratic system persists equally under Imperialist , Constitutional , and Republican arrangements . As the Duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier pointed out , " Empires fall , Ministries pass away , but Bureaux remain . " The aggregate of forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the nation together , but in the ideas and sentiments of its units , is so powerful , that the excision of a part , even though it be the government , is quickly followed by the substitution of a like part . It needs but to recall the truth exemplified some chapters back , that the properties of the aggregate are determined by the properties of its units , to see at once that so long as the characters of citizens remain substantially unchanged , there can be no substantial change in the political organization which has slowly been evolved by them . This double difficulty of thought , with the double set of delusions fallen into by those who do not surmount it , is , indeed , naturally associated with the once-universal , and stillgeneral , belief that societies arise by manufacture , instead of arising , as they do , by evolution . Recognize the truth that incorporated masses of men grow , and acquire their structural characters through modification upon modification , and there are excluded these antithetical errors that humanity remains the same and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these errors comes admission of the inference , that the changes which have brought social arrangements to a form so different from past forms , will in future carry them on to forms as different from those now existing . Once become habituated to the thought of a continuous unfolding of the whole and of each part , and these misleading // ideas disappear . Take a word and observe how , while changing , it gives origin in course of time to a family of words , each changing member of which similarly has progeny ; take a custom , as that of giving eggs at Easter , which has now developed in Paris into the fashion of making expensive presents of every imaginable kind inclosed in imitation-eggs , becoming at length large enough to contain a brougham , and which entails so great a tax that people go abroad to evade it ; take a law , once quite simple and made to meet a special case , and see how it eventually , by successive additions and changes , grows up into a complex group of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conqueror came our whole legal system regulating land-tenure ; ? take a social appliance , as the Press , and see how from the news-letter , originally private and written , and then assuming the shape of a printed Hy-leaf to a written private letter , there has slowly evolved this vast assemblage of journals and periodicals , daily , weekly , general , and local , that have , individually and as an aggregate , grown in size while growing in heterogeneity ; do this , and do the like with all other established institutions , agencies , products , and there will come naturally the conviction that now , too , there are various germs of things which will in the future develop in ways no one imagines , and take shares in profound transformations of society and of its members : transformations that are hopeless as immediate results , but certain as ultimate results . Try to fit a hand with five fingers into a glove with four . Your difficulty aptly parallels the difficulty of putting a complex conception into a mind not having a proportionately-complex faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up a thought become many and varied , there must be brought into play many and varied parts of the intellectual structure , before the thought can be comprehended : and if some of these parts are wanting , only fragments of the thought can be taken in . Consider an instance . What is meant by the ratio of A to B , may be explained to a boy by drawing a short line A and a long line B , telling him that A is said to bear a small ratio to B ; and then , after lengthening the line A , telling him that A is now said to bear // a larger ratio to B. But suppose I have to explain what is meant by saying that the ratio of A to B , equals the ratio of C to D. Instead of two different quantities and one relation , there are now four different quantities and three relations . To understand the proposition , the boy has to think of A and B and their difference , and , without losing his intellectual grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D and their difference , and , without losing his intellectual grasp of these , he has to think of the two differences as each having a like relation to its pair of quantities . Thus the number of terms and relations to be kept before the mind , is such as to imply the co-operation of many more agents of thought ; any of which being absent , the proposition can not be understood : the boy must be older before he will understand it , and , if uncultured , will probably never understand it at all . Let us pass on to a conception of still greater complexity ? say that the ratio of A to B varies as the ratio of C to D. Far more numerous things have now to be represented in consciousness with approximate simultaneity . A and B have to be thought of as not constant in their lengths , but as one or both of them changing in their lengths ; so that their difference is indefinitely variable . Similarly with C and D. And then the variability of the ratio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthen and shorten , the thing to be understood is , that whatever difference any change brings about between A and B , the relation it bears to one or other of them , is always like that which the difference simultaneously arising between C and D bears to one or other of them . The greater multiplicity of ideas required for mentally framing this proposition , evidently puts it further beyond the reach of faculties not developed by appropriate culture , or not capable of being so developed . And as the type of proposition becomes still more involved , as it does when two such groups of dependent variables are compared and conclusions drawn , it begins to require a grasp that is easy only to the disciplined mathematician . One who does not possess that complexity of faculty which , as we here see , is requisite for grasping a complex conception , may , in cases like these , become conscious of his incapacity ; not from perceiving what he lacks , but from perceiving that another person achieves results which he can not achieve . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictions comes in to prove to one of inferior faculty that his faculty is inferior , he is usually unaware of the inferiority . To imagine a higher mode of consciousness , is in some degree to have it ; so that until he has it in some degree , he can not really conceive of its existence . An illustration or two will make this clear . Take a child on your knee , and , turning over with him some engravings of landscapes , note what he observes . " I see a man in a boat , " says he , pointing . " Look at the cows coming down the hill . " " And there is a little boy playing with a dog . " These and other such remarks , mostly about the living objects in each scene , are all you get from him . Never by any chance does he utter a word respecting the scene as a whole . There is an absolute unconsciousness of anything to be pleased with in the combination of wood and water and mountain . And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see that he has not the remotest idea that such a consciousness exists in others but is wanting in himself . Note now a case in which a kindred defect is betrayed by an adult . You have , perhaps , in the course of your life , had some musical culture ; and can recall the stages through which you have passed . In early days a symphony was a mystery ; and you were somewhat puzzled to find others applauding it . An unfolding of musical faculty , that went on slowly through succeeding years , brought some appreciation ; and now these complex musical combinations which once gave you little or no pleasure , give you more pleasure than any others . Remembering all this , you suspect that your indifference to certain still more involved musical combinations may arise from incapacity in you , and not from faults in them . See , on the other hand , what happens with one who has undergone no such series of changes ? say , an old naval officer , whose life at sea kept him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally confess , or rather boast , how much he enjoys the bagpipes . While the last cadences of a sonata which a young lady has just played , are still in your ears , he goes up to her and asks whether she can play " Polly , put the kettle on , " or " Johnny comes marching home . " And then , when concerts are talked about at // table , he seizes the occasion for expressing his dislike of classical music , and scarcely conceals his contempt for those who go to hear it . On contemplating his mental state , you see that along with absence of the ability to grasp complex musical combinations , there goes no consciousness of the absence ? there is no suspicion that such complex combinations exist , and that other persons have faculties for appreciating them . And now for the application of this general truth to our subject . The conceptions with which sociological science is concerned , are complex beyond all others . In the absence of faculty having a corresponding complexity , they can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the absence of an adequately-complex faculty is not accompanied by any consciousness of incapacity . Rather do we find that deficiency in the required kind of mental grasp , is accompanied by extreme confidence of judgment on sociological questions , and a ridicule of those who , after long discipline , begin to perceive what there is to be understood , and how difficult is the right understanding of it . A simple illustration of this will prepare the way for more-involved illustrations . A few months ago the Times gave us an account of the last achievement in automatic printing ? the " Walter-Press , " by which its own immense edition is thrown off in a few hours every morning . Suppose a reader of the description , adequately familiar with mechanical details , follows what he reads step by step with full comprehension : perhaps making his ideas more definite by going to see the apparatus at work and questioning the attendants . Now he goes away thinking he understands all about it . Possibly , under its aspect as a feat in mechanical engineering , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect , as implying in Mr. Walter and those who co-operated with him certain traits , moral and intellectual , he does so . But under its sociological aspect he probably has no notion of its meaning ; and does not even suspect that it has a sociological aspect . Yet if he begins to look into the genesis of the thing , he will find that he is but on the threshold of the full explanation . On asking not what is its proximate but what is its remote origin , he finds , in the first place , that this automatic printing-machine is lineally descended from other automatic printing-machines , which // have undergone successive developments ? each pre-supposing others that went before : without cylinder printing-machines long previously used and improved , there would have been no " Walter-Press . " He inquires a step further , and discovers that this last improvement became possible only by the help of papier-mc the stereotyping , which , first employed for making flat plates , afforded the possibility of making cylindrical plates . And tracing this hack , he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another process before that . Again , he learns that this highest form of automatic printing , like the many less-developed forms preceding it , depended for its practicability on the introduction of rollers for distributing ink , instead of the hand-implements used by " printer's-devils " fifty years ago ; which rollers , again , could never have been made fit for their present purposes , without the discovery of that curious elastic compound out of which they are cast . And then , on tracing the more remote antecedents , he finds an incestry of hand printing-presses , which , through generations , had been successively improved . Now , perhaps , he thinks he understands the apparatus , considered as a sociological fact . Far from it . Its multitudinous parts , which will work together only when highly finished and exactly adjusted , came from machineshops ; where there are varieties of complicated , highly-finished engines for turning cylinders , cutting out wheels , planing bars , and so forth ; and on the pre-existence of these the existence of this printing-machine depended . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds they have severally been , in the slow course of mechanical progress , brought to their present perfection by the help of preceding complex automatic tools of various kinds , that co-operated to make their component parts ? each larger , or more accurate , lathe or planing-machine having been made possible by preexisting lathes and planing-machines , inferior in size or exactness . And so if he traces back the whole contents of the machine-shop , with its many different instruments , he comes in course of time to the blacksmith 's hammer and anvil ; and even , eventually , to still ruder appliances . The explanation is now completed , he thinks . Not at all . No such process as that which the " Walter-Press " shows us , was possible // until there had been invented , and slowly perfected , a papermachine capable of making miles of paper without break . Thus there is the genesis of the paper-machine involved , and that of the multitudinous appliances and devices which preceded it , and are at present implied by it . Have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we have just glanced at one group of the antecedents . All this development of mechanical appliances ? this growth of the iron-manufacture , this extensive use of machinery made from iron , this production of so many machines for making machines ? has had for one of its causes the abundance of the raw materials , coal and iron ; has had for another of its causes the insular position which has favoured peace and the increase of industrial activity . There have been moral causes at work too . Without that readiness to sacrifice present ease to future benefit , which is implied by enterprise , there would never have arisen the machine in question , ? nay , there would never have arisen the multitudinous improved instruments and processes that have made it possible . And beyond the moral traits which enterprise pre-supposes , there are those pre-supposed by efficient co-operation . Without mechanical engineers who fulfilled their contracts tolerably well , by executing work accurately , neither this machine itself nor the machines that made it , could have been produced ; and without artizans having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try to get such products out of an inferior race , and you will find defective character an insuperable obstacle . So , too , will you find defective intelligence an insuperable obstacle . The skilled artizan is not an accidental product , either morally or intellectually . The intelligence needed for making a new thing is not everywhere to be found ; nor is there everywhere to be found the accuracy of perception and nicety of execution without which no complex machine can be so made that it will act . Exactness of finish in machines has developed pari passe with exactness of perception in artizans . Inspect some mechanical appliance made a century ago , and you may see that , even had all other requisite conditions been fulfilled , want of the requisite skill in workmen would have been a fatal obstacle to the production of an engine requiring so many delicate adjustments . So that there are implied in // this mechanical achievement , not only our slowly-generated industrial state , with its innumerable products and processes , but also the slowly-moulded moral and intellectual natures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , we have left out a whole division of all-important social phenomena ? those which we group as the progress of knowledge . Along with the many other developments that have been necessary antecedents to this machine , there has been the development of Science . The growing and improving arts of all kinds , have been helped up , step after step , by those generalized experiences , becoming ever wider , more complete , more exact , which make up what we call Mathematics , Physics , Chemistry , &c.; Without a considerably-developed Geometry , there could never have been the machines for making machines ; still less this machine that has proceeded from them . Without a developed Physics , there would have been no steam-engine to move these various automatic appliances , primary and secondary ; nor would the many implied metallurgic processes have been brought to the needful perfection . And in the absence of a developed Chemistry , many other requirements , direct and indirect , could not have been adequately fulfilled . So that , in fact , this organization of knowledge which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present stage before such a machine could come into existence ; supposing all other pre-requisites to be satisfied . Surely we have now got to the end of the history . Not quite : there yet remains an essential factor . No one goes on year after year spending thousands of pounds and much time , and persevering through disappointment and anxiety , without a strong motive : the " Walter-Press " was not a mere tour de force . Why , then , was it produced ? To meet an immense demand with great promptness ? to print , with one machine , 16,000 copies per hour . Whence arises this demand ? From an extensive reading public , brought in the course of generations to have a keen morning-appetite for news of all kinds ? merchants who need to know the latest prices at home and the latest telegrams from abroad ; politicians who must learn the result of last night 's division , be informed of the new diplomatic move , and read the speeches at a meeting ; sporting men who look for the odds and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the births , marriages , and deaths . And on asking the origin of these many desires to be satisfied , they prove to be concomitants of our social state in general ? its trading , political , philanthropic , and other activities ; for in societies where these are not dominant , the demand for news of various kinds rises to no such intensity . See , then , how enormously involved is the genesis of this machine , as a sociological phenomenon . A whole encyclopaedia of mechanical inventions ? some dating from the earliest times ? go to the explanation of it . Thousands of years of discipline , by which the impulsive improvident nature of the savage has been evolved into a comparatively selfcontrolling nature , capable of sacrificing present ease to future good , are pre-supposed . There is pre-supposed the equallylong discipline by which the inventive faculty , almost wholly absent in the savage , has been evolved ; and by which accuracy , not even conceived by the savage , has been cultivated . And there is further pre-supposed the slow political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these other changes , that has brought us to a state in which such a machine finds a function to fulfil . The complexity of a sociological fact , and the difficulty of adequately grasping it , will now perhaps be more apparent . For as in this case there has been a genesis , so has there been in every other case , be it of institution , arrangement , custom , belief , &c.; ; but while in this case the genesis is comparatively easy to trace , because of the comparatively-concrete character of process and product , it is in other cases difficult to trace , because the factors are mostly not of sensible kinds . And yet only when the genesis has been traced ? only when the antecedents of all orders have been observed in their co-operation , generation after generation , through past social states ? is there reached that interpretation of a fact which makes it a part of sociological science , properly understood . If , for instance , the true meaning of such phenomena as those presented by tradecombinations is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote Old-English periods when analogous causes produced analogous results . As Brentano points out " The workmen formed their Trade-Unions against the aggressions of the then rising manufacturing lords , as in earlier times the old
