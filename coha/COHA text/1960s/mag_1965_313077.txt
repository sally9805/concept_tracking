Some of the demonstrators may face an even more horrendous fate-Army duty in Viet Nam . The Pentagon last week issued a draft call for 45,224 men in December , the largest monthly quota since the Korean War . They may be needed . Last July , when President Johnson ordered an increase in the size of the armed forces , he predicted that monthly inductions would rise to only 35,000 men . However , instead of a planned buildup of 125,000 U.S. troops in Viet Nam , the U.S. force there has already grown to 145,000 , and it will pass the 200,000 mark by year 's end . At the same time , Defense Secretary Robert McNamara 's " selected force " of 150,000 National Guardsmen and Army reservists ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) got orders to speed up its training so that it could be deployed within eight weeks after mobilization . Reservists will not be called to active duty , according to present plans , save in a major crisis such as an open declaration of war by Peking or Hanoi .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
