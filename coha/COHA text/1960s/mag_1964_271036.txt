Whatever weapons the Air Force finally gets for big wars of the future-manned supersonic bombers , or more potent missiles , or a mix of both-there is little argument about what is needed for the small , brushfire battles of the present . Army , Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps all agree that they need fighter planes and transports husky enough to handle modern armament , yet agile enough to take off and land on back-country roads or small jungle clearings . <P> The problems that must be solved are already encouraging fanciful flights of aerodynamicists ' imaginations . The suggested solutions are many and bizarre . Some of the more interesting : <P> &gt; TILT WING : Rolled out last week by Ling-Tempco-Vought , Inc. of Dallas , the XC-142A transport has four turbo-prop engines and a wing that can be tilted for takeoff so that its four 15.6-ft. propellers point upward . When they all are pulling together , the props should generate enough direct lift to raise the plane vertically . When safely above obstacles , the pilot will gradually tilt the wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be flown , but its designers admit that it is no speedster . It will cruise at less than 300 m.p.h. , and its operating radius with full load is only about 230 miles . These limits are the penalties it pays for its vertical lifting power . <P> &gt; TILT ENGINES : Other aircraft designers prefer to keep their wings fixed and to swivel only the engine or the engine exhaust . The Curtis-Wright X-19 has four tillable engines on the tips of two stubby wings . The Bell X-22A has four tiltable propellers in circular ducts . Neither plane has yet completed successful tests , but two years ago the British were already flying the Hawker Siddeley P-1127 , which has a single jet engine with 13,500 lbs . of thrust . During takeoff , the engine 's exhaust gases are diverted downward , exerting enough thrust to lift the airplane off the ground . At cruise altitude , the exhaust is switched to the rear and the plane flies in normal jet-plane style . The P-1127 has done everything claimed for it , but its payload is small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value as a fighter . Hawker Siddeley is building a bigger model with a more powerful vectored thrust engine that it expects to be supersonic and also able to take off from British lanes . <P> &gt; LIFT ENGINES : In yet another approach to the problem , France 's Dassault Mirage III-V will pack eight small Rolls-Royce jet engines thrusting downward . When well in the air , a larger jet will take over and push the plane forward at supersonic speed . Its designers admit that the vertical engines will be dead cargo most of the time , but they think vertical engines will have less effect on performance than dual-purpose engines that are too powerful for efficient horizontal flight . A German V/STOL , the Blkow , Heinkel and Messerschmitt VJ-101C , varies the French formula slightly by having two main engines that are tiltable and supplementing their thrust with two vertical-lift engines . The VJ-101C has made many vertical takeoffs with successful transition to horizontal flight .
