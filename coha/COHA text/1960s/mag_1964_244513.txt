When 500 far-out medical investigators gathered in Chicago last week for the annual meeting of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs , they spent much of their time discussing something that is far too big ever to be implanted as an internal organ : the artificial kidney . And the biggest news about it was a plan to make it still bigger , so that a machine that is now about the size of a home washing machine will take on the dimensions of a laundry . It will also , its developers hope , wash out the metabolic poisons from the blood of as many as 15 kidney-disease victims at once . <P> 12-Hour Treatments . Nowhere has the artificial kidney received more attention than in Seattle , where Dr. Belding H. Scribner pioneered in adapting the machine to treat patients whose own kidneys have almost completely shut down . These patients excrete such a small volume of urine that it can not carry a full load of the body 's waste chemicals . Without the repeated treatment , they could not live more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as four years , and they are back at work or running their households . <P> Permanently implanted in these patients ' forearms are two plastic tubes , one leading into an artery , the other into a vein . Once or twice a week the patients go to the hospital , where the tubes are hooked up to the artificial kidney . Their blood flows through one of its chambers , and body poisons pass through a cellophane sheet into the second chamber 's purifying bath ( " dialysate " ) . The average treatment lasts twelve hours . <P> The trouble is that the life-saving program is hideously expensive . It is not so much the first cost as the upkeep . To treat eleven patients , the Seattle Artificial Kidney Center at Swedish Hospital has a staff of two fulltime physicians and one halftime , plus five nurses and five technicians . <P> Diluted 35 Times . One way to cut costs by about 15% from the present $10,000 a year per patient , Engineer Lars Grimsrud told the artificial-organ enthusiasts , is to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 100-gallon tanks for each patient . In the central tank of the " monster , " as the Seattle machine is called , the fluid is highly concentrated , and the machine dilutes it with as much as 35 times its own volume of water to get the right mixture for each patient . Patients still have personalized equipment at their bedsides : pumps to deliver the right amount of fluid from the monster , and the sandwich-like filter . <P> At University Hospital , doctors have already used " the monster " for as many as three patients at once .
