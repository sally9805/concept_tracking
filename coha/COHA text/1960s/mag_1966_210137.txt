Not in many years had the much-assaulted pharmaceutical industry heard such an unbridled attack as came last week from the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . About 500 drug-company delegates gathered at Boca Raton , Fla. , for the annual convention of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association could have used some of their own tranquilizers after the FDA 's new boss , Dr. James Goddard , got up to speak . He accused the industry 's executives of slovenliness , deception and dishonesty-and warned them that they had better straighten up or else face much stricter controls . <P> Matter of Tone . After just ten weeks on the job , Goddard-the first physician in 40 years to chair the FDA-said that he had seen flagrant examples of sloppy research , improper labeling , and misleading advertising . In the area of new drugs still under investigation , he was astounded by " low-quality work " and " conscious withholding of unfavorable animal or clinical data . " He had also been " shocked at the clear attempts to slip something by us . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited examples of attempts that might make any physician cringe . One manufacturer of a new drug wanted to label it " effective in a few " cases of cancer . Goddard said that of 127 patients treated in trials , only five had had temporary reductions in the size of tumors ; to him this was not at all effective . In another instance , the maker of a long-acting sulfa , which had been clinically proved to be effective only in treating the genitourinary tract , wanted to imply on the label that the drug could be prescribed to treat acne . <P> Goddard went from labeling to advertising . In the past year , he said , the FDA found fault in ads run by nearly one-third of the members of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association . " Some advertising cases have been quite abusive of regulations . They have trumpeted results of favorable research and have not mentioned unfavorable research ; they have puffed up what was insignificant clinical evidence ; they have substituted emotional appeals for scientific ones . " To Goddard , it was all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug categorically ' relaxes both physical and emotional tension ' all by itself . But a drug can help to relax these conditions or can often relax these conditions . " <P> Watch Each Other . Then Goddard made an implicit threat : " Every time the pharmaceutical manufacturers see a violation of law made by one of their number-and then look away-the pressure builds up even more for tougher , tighter , more sweeping regulatory action and legislative control over the drug industry . " <P> When they got over the shock , the drugmakers reacted cautiously . Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association President C. Joseph Stetler regretted that Goddard 's reprimand would be interpreted as a blanket indictment , yet conceded that " nobody in that room wanted to be with firms that were responsible for submitting the data mentioned in the speech . " On the other hand , a high official of the Health , Education and Welfare Department , which supervises FDA , found the speech " a good first draft-but a bit intemperate.
