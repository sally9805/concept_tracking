I think UCLA has high hopes and just is n't talking much , " said the University of Pennsylvania 's Joe Burk as he loaded his crew onto a bus for the International Rowing Association regatta in Syracuse , N.Y . last week . " I have a daughter in college at Santa Barbara who knows several of the UCLA oarsmen , and she thinks they 're quite confident of sneaking up on us. " // The tone was typical of Burk , undeniably the most modest and respected college rowing coach in the U.S. For regardless of what Joe 's daughter may have thought about the Bruins ' chances in the I.R.A. , every other expert at Lake Onondaga was pretty sure that Burk 's own Quakers would sweep the regatta and grab a victory that had eluded them for 67 years . // Penn 's varsity had not won the I.R.A . since 1900 and , until last year 's freshman victory , no Quaker crew of any kind had won a race in the championships since 1924 . But in the year 1967 the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varsity were all favored to win , the varsity doubly so since the only crew that seemed capable of defeating it was busy elsewhere . Harvard 's rowing machine , coached by Harry Parker , himself a onetime student of Burk 's , was getting ready to win its 27th consecutive intercollegiate race against Yale at New London . // At Onondaga , some 15,000 sweat-shirted , shorted and print-dressed spectators were on hand as Penn got an exceptionally strong start in the two-mile , 11-boat freshman race . Syracuse , Princeton and Rutgers took futile turns in the lead until the young Quakers decided to make their move after a mile and an eighth . Already stroking at 36 , they went up to 39 ? , passed Washington and , half a mile from the finish , took the lead . They were rowing a ragged but powerful 43 when they crossed the finish line three-quarters of a length ahead of Rutgers . It was a strong race to be rowed by freshmen. // An approaching thunderstorm beyond the finish line was coloring the sky gray and violet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioed down to the start . Officials ordered the varsity boats to launch and the jayvees to begin their race anyway . Syracuse again took an early lead , with Wisconsin second . Shortly after the half-mile mark , Penn powered to the front at 35 . Syracuse briefly regained the lead before Pennsylvania began pulling away by a third of a length , a full length , two lengths . Penn was ahead by two and a half and nearing the two-mile mark of the three-mile race when the thunderstorm finally hit them . // Amid cries from ship-to-shore radio that some  --  or few , or none  --  of the boats could be seen , the Penn shell , in an unprotected outside lane , was skewed off its course , losing all forward progress . Wisconsin , Navy and Cornell , all in inside lanes , came on strong . With a magnificent effort , the Quakers , who were nearly swamped , managed to right themselves and flailed back . But Navy , after much confusion about lanes engendered by the Middies having steered in toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes 28.2 seconds , costing second-place Penn its chance to sweep the regatta. // At the starting line the Brown varsity had also come to grief during the brief storm , and along with 13 other crews rowed to shore in order to bail out and mop up . Because Washington and Northeastern had cannily returned to the boathouse , the big race was delayed an hour . // The varsity race , when it did start , was all Penn : Penn starting fast , Penn coming on to take second after three-quarters of a mile and first after a mile , Penn half a length over Wisconsin and Navy , Penn by a full length over Wisconsin and Navy after two and one-eighth miles , Penn by a length and a deck , by two lengths , by almost two and a half at the finish , while stroking 36 . At the end Pennsylvania had not only won its first I.R.A . varsity championship in 67 years but the Ten Eyck trophy for the best all-round performance in the entire regatta with 19 out of a possible 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvanian from West Conshohocken , is always ready with a joke . With a great show of effort he did a one-hand press of the huge , grotesquely ornate Varsity Challenge Cup for the benefit of photographers . " It 's goddam heavy when you 've just finished rowing a race , " he moaned . But Stroke John Ferriss , one of two sophomores in the Penn boat , remained dead serious even in victory . " I did n't think we had it won until we crossed the finish line , " he said . " We 've beaten too many other crews from that far back . " // A succession of junior varsity men came up to Burk . " Sir , we 're sorry , " they said . " We know we cost you the sweep .... " // " It was n't your fault , " Joe Burk answered . " I just felt bad for you . " To a bystander he said , " That 's the kind of boys they are . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
