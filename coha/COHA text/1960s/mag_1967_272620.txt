In recent years , summer music has moved steadily indoors for air-conditioned comfort . But this season more and more Americans are defying chiggers and heat for the trill , the toot and the oompah-pah of old-fashioned outdoor summer band concerts . <P> Not much has changed . True , the fashion is Bermuda shorts instead of bloomers and Tijuana Taxi instead of Yes , We Have No Bananas . But otherwise the concerts are like snapshots out of an old family album , with folding chairs and blankets on the grass ; piccolos and glockenspiels , vanilla uniforms with sundae braid and dangling whistles ; waltzes and marches and " special symphonic versions " of Lady of Spain and Ethelbert Nevin 's Rosary . <P> Some summer bandsmen are professionals , but others are amateurs who trade briefcases and lunch buckets for trumpets and sousaphones . The trend is noticeable in several parts of the country , but is especially strong in New England , where Chatham , Mass. , draws audiences from Boston and beyond . Winsted , Conn. , Rotarians raised $6,000 to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 50-member band a new shell . Boston 's new Prudential Center plaza has gingham-covered tables , straw boaters on the light globes and its own Gazebo Band . <P> <P> Clinkers Can Be Fun . Today 's band concert echoes with some new sounds . <P> A public-address system has replaced the megaphone , and jet planes overhead often add a discordant note . But the grace notes of yesterday still abound . <P> Conductors lead audiences as well as their bands , local trumpeters still get the spotlight for tremulous solos , people still sing along on Let Me Call You Sweetheart , and somebody is bound to give the bandleader a chance to say : <P> " I have little Sally Knight up here-Sally would like her parents to come up and get her . " <P> By the time a typical concert ends with The Star Spangled Banner or Stars and Stripes Forever , the clues to its popularity are easy to see . For one , it is free . For another , even clinkers are fun to people who are there as participants , friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item of civic pride . " It 's a true gathering of the real family life of America , " says one mother , who might be quoting The Music Man line : " Got ta figger out a way t'keep the young ones moral after school ! " The old find charm in the band-concert tradition and the young often find delight . " It 's old enough to be new , " says a middle-aged man , and a teen-ager adds : " You ca n't say just because something was started a long time ago that 60 or 70 years later it 's old-fashioned . " <P> One concert backer cited the universal appeal of " pleasant music , outdoors in the " ummertime , " but another summed it up more tartly . " We 're sick of the 20th century , " said he , " we hear it on the radio and TV all the time . <P> Here there are no commercials , and nobody 's worried about acidosis. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
