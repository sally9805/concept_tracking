The Meaning of the Selma March : GREAT DAY AT TRICKEM FORK What did it prove , that famous Selma march seven weeks ago ? When the march was over and the marchers safely gone from Alabama , what happened tothefearful Negroeswho remained ? Now that the headlines have faded , it is time to consider the surprising significance of Selma . THERE were three dozen or more of these Negroes  --  men , mostly old men , and women and children  --  and they were standing under and around these two oak trees that were planted about 30 feet apart in front of the Rolen School , which is just west of the Mount Gillard Baptist Church on the north side of U.S. 80 at Trickem Fork , Ala . Trickem Fork is a dusty little Negro community about 22 miles from Brown 's Chapel in Selma , and about 32 miles from the state capitol in Montgomery . It is in the heart of what they call the Black Belt , and it was 4:20 in the afternoon , with the sun descending in the clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buds just starting on those two oak trees that were planted there 34 years ago and have trunks now that are as big around as a man 's waist . " They ought a be comin ' pretty soon now , " somebody said , looking west and into the sun where the two-lane highway curves to the right . " They ought a be here any time . " It was a big thing . It was bigger than they knew . They knew that Martin Luther King was going to lead all these whites and Negroes together from Selma right past Trickem Fork to Montgomery , but they did not know that it was a big thing in newspapers all over the world . They did not know that it was on television not only all over the United States but in Europe too , and that , the day before , some people had walked seven miles on the island of Guam , and 1,000 had marched in New Rochelle , N.Y. , and 2,000 in Portsmouth , Va. , and 1,200 had climbed Mount Royal in Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to lead whites and Negroes ( continued on page 89 ) right past the two oak trees in front of the Rolen School at Trickem Fork . " I remember the day , " Jesse Favor said . " when we planted those trees . I was ten years old then , and those trees were n't no bigger ' round than my wrist . The school was in good shape at that particular time . " The school is in bad shape now . It sits up on red bricks , and there are five wide unpainted wooden steps leading up to the two front doors . Half of the second step has rotted away and has never been replaced , and there are holes in the walls where the asphalt shingles have been broken and have fallen to the ground . Inside there are three classrooms . for the first through the sixth grades . and three teachers , and there are broken blackboards and holes in the floor with Alabama license plates nailed over them . There are potbellied stoves in the rooms , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind comes through the walls and up through the door , and the latrine is out in back . " In my day . " Jesse Favor says , " there was a sign out here that declared this was a school , and they had four teachers . and the principal 's name was Professor Wiley Thomas . One momin ' in January of ' Thirty-one he sent seven of us to get two trees , and we Prit back about a quarter mile . It was ' rest then , and it became farmland . nd now it 's pasture . I remember we Atered them trees two-three days , and . en we had a good rain , and we did n't : wave to water them no more . " Jesse Favor would know . Once Jesse Favor rigged up a gallon water jug over a watermelon . He rigged it so it would drip slowly onto the roots of the melon. and each day he 'd refill the jug , and the melon grew to 80 pounds . Jesse Favor knows a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he learned to read when he was six by following a story about a one-eyed ape that appeared every day in the newspaper . He could n't go to school regularly because he had to help out in the fields . " In the fifth grade , " he says . " I stayed out of school five years and went back and in five months finished two grades . Then I stayed out two years and finished through the ninth grade . " After Jesse Favor grew up , though , he spent about 5400 on books , and he learned to do electrical work , and he studied veterinary medicine by mail . Then he got what he calls " the tools , " and people used to come to him when they wanted their cows vaccinated and their horses shot .

" If you 're in Los Angeles or Dallas , you can go to a bus station and buy a ticket for or Trickem . It 'll say Trickem on that ticket , and that bus is gon na stop and let you off right by those trees . " " I lerc they conic now ! " somebody standing under one of the oak trees said . " Here they conic now , " T here had been about 3.200 outside Brown 's Chapel in Selma the morning before , and there must have been about 200 inside , milling around in the aisles , and under the balcony that runs around the two sides and back , and up on the stage where there is a white cross with lightbulbs in it over the altar .

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . got there the bare floorboards were strewn with paper coffee cups and sandwich papers , and smoke from a garbage fire was corning through a window . " Hey , you stop that ! " somebody hollered al the four Negro kids feeding the garbage lire in the backyard . " You put that out ! " Outside on the steps was a lectern covered with a white cloth . The smoke from the garbage lire was coming between the church and the parsonage , and cinders were falling on the crowd when Martin Luther King spoke . " You will be the people that will light a new chapter in the history hooks of our nation . . . . This is one of the greatest demonstrations for human rights in history . . . We have waited for freedom . We are tired of waiting . Now is the time . . . Walk together . children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead us to the promised land . And Alabama will be a new Alabama , and America will he a new America . " As soon as they had left Brown 's Chapel and turned right on Alabama Avenue , they had encountered hostile whites . The women were the worst . The white men watched from the sidelines and . for the most part , smirked and said nothing , but the first two women , in their early 50 's , plump . dressed for Sunday and their gray hair professionally set , were standing opposite the Selma Arms Company . " I ai n't seen a nigger I know yet . " the one in the brown-and-white-checked coat said to the one in the gray coat . " If I see any I know . " the one in gray said , " I 'll run out and kick ' em . " " Look ! " the one in the brown-andwhite-checked coat said , liking the idea that had just come to her and shouting it , not at her friend , but at the marchers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white niggers ! White niggers ! " SELMA MARCH " You should hear this . " said a thin , middle-aged man in a gray suit , a transistor radio to his right ear , ' ' They 're playin ' BYe . Bye , Blackbird ! " " White niggers ! White niggers ! " the woman in the brown-and-white-checked coat was shouting . " We shall overcome , " the marchers were singing , their eyes straight ahead . " We shall overcome , someday . " Then they were across the Edmund Pettus Bridge where , two weeks before , the state troopers had tear-gassed them and clubbed them . and at the first crossroad a white woman in her early 30 's was standing with a boy of about six and a girl of about four . She was wearing a car coat and corduroy slacks , and when she began to shout , the boy and the girt turned and looked up at their mother . " You all got your birth-control pills ? " their mother shouted . " You all got your birth-control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . What Sister Patrice , from San Mateo .

" To see them . they had to look into the sun , so that the marchers came to Item almost like silhouettes . Thcre were only : itto of then ' now , bccause a cowl order cut down their number when the highway narrowed to two lanes , hut , walking three abreast and with the vehicles , they stretched hack around the curve of the road . First there were the two Alabama Highway Patrol cars , the Confederate flags painted on the front bumpers , the speedometers holding between 2 and 2.5 miles an hour , and then the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open truck with the TV and newsreel cameramen and the photographers , and then the marchers . Then there were the ambulances , two more Army Jeeps , the communications van , the latrine truck and then the press cars , and overhead were the helicopters and the light planes . " Lorcly ! " Mrs. Mary Jane Jackson said . " I did n't ever thought I 'd seen anythin ' like this ! " Mrs. Mary Jane Jackson is a Negro . She is 73. and her husband is two years older , and they have lived here all their lives . Mrs. Mary Jane Jackson says she got into the second grade in school but she never did get out . She and her husband farmed eight acres , until they both got what she calls " the arthrite , " and they reared 10 children , and now seven of them live in Detroit where , she says , some do housework . and some are in steel work , and some work at the auto place .

" Now , look at this ! " the Rev , Andr  --  w Young was shouting , turning in the front line of the march , and calling it back and pointing .

Andrew Young had known that the second day was going to to be a tough day . with the first flush of enthusiasm gone , and the muscles tightening in the legs , and the blisters forming on the feet , and that is why he had used the Mount Gillard Church to keep them going . He had known it was going to be a tough day when he had looked out of the pink-and-white communications van in the ' middle of the campsite at 7:10 A.M. and had seen them standing in the chow line . It was a long chow line , snaking out and around and back , and it was below freezing . and there was frost on the nd , and they were all cold . They not washed . and few of them had t after most of the kerosene space ters had burned out in the two big ts . There was one young . Bark-ed white woman with a dark-blue et over her shoulders and wearing ue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to warm her feet . m ashes and oatmeal . She said she was from Portland . Oreg. , and a writer . and the ashes were warm from a refuse fill of the night before and , as the i ..... came by and tossed the paper plates with the remains of the breakfast on them into the ashes , there was still some warmth in the oatmeal too . They came from everywhere . Charles Campbell . a Negro high-school teacher , came from Hawaii where , he said , there is proof that the races can live together . An inflamed tendon in his right heel was giving him pain , and he was embarrassed that the lei he was wearing was made of plastic . Charles B. Rangel , a Negro lawyer , came from New York where , he said , he had never heard from a white woman , or from anyone else , the cry : " Niggers ! Niggers ! Kill the God-dam niggers !

" you need constant stimulation . After we got away from the populous areas , where we got the jeering , things kind of flattened out . You 'd think : ' If soniehoily 'd just throw a rock at us . If a guy everybody liked had a heart attack . ' You ca n't kill dragons if there are n't any . " Doctor Lyon is 37 years old and has an actor 's good looks , and he is married and has two children . He is studying now at Bloy House Theological School of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles . but both he and his wife are from the South , and he said that they both felt that at least one of them should have a stake in this march . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Most of us are n't used to having people shout at us : '  --  you ! Go home ! ' Most of these ministers have n't heard a cross word in ten or liteen years , and it 's been scary at night . I mean , you look out and see the campfires burning , and the troops standing around them . The troops do n't exactly reassure you , either . At night we were trying to get one of our medical vehicles into the campsite , and this National Guard Jeep was partially blocking the entry . We asked them if they 'd please hack up a little , but they did n't look at us or say a thing . and they did n't move the Jeep . Later another one of them walked by one of our ears and , with his bayonet . he put a scratch from one end to the other . " The college students here . " he said . " they 're above average in intelligence . and they really care , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , or an athlete or a wealthy one . These kids here are mostly the semioutcasts . " I 'd say that I 've talked with about fifteen people , " he said . " and seven or eight knew I was talking professionally . On the first day , there was this older man from San Francisco who was disoriented  --  not sure why he was here  --  and I convinced him that he 'd fulfilled his obligations , and he went back . " Then there was a college kid who would have done all right , except that he 'd gone two or three nights without sleep , and he had n't eaten regularly . He was agitated physically , with his lips moving , and a priest spotted him and brought him to me . " On the first night , just as dusk came , a priest came up . and he 'd seen a lot of combat in Europe . With the darkness coming on he 'd started to panic , so I told him he was showing good judgment in confessing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selma , and I went looking for transportation . When I got back they were babying him , and he was sitting there crying , with a nurse holding his hand . afraid now to go back to Selma . The most extreme , " he said , " was this university chaplain . The students had taken up a collection , and they wanted representation , and he 'd had to come . Somebody had spotted him early . and we 'd noticed at speeches he 'd stand up in front with his arms folded across his chest and a kind of defiant I lok on his face . Then , at about two-thirty in the morning I saw him standing around one of the fires with a group of young Negroes . He had a can of vegetable soup in his hand , and he was using the label for a religious text and delivering a sermon about southern okra . " I got him out of there , and I wanted to get him to sleep . but he could n't find his bedroll . So I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could watch him , and a few minutes later I looked for him , and there was my bedroll , with him inside of it , moving across the ground like a caterpillar . We got him into a car then , and we took him into St. Jude in Montgomery . On the way he was ranting. and it turned out he hated Negroes , Catholics , Episcopalians. almost everybody . At St. Jude they had him on the surgical table to give him a shot to quiet him , and there were four of them holding him when he got his arms loose , and he sat right up . There was a nun in white standing at the foot of the table , and he looked right at her and said : ' , Sister ! ' There was a Negro doctor there who said he 'd take care of him and see that eventually he 'd get back to his university . " All right ! " The Rev. Andrew Young was saying now . " Let 's get movin ' again . Let 's move out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two oak trees at Trickem Fork , three abreast . The federalized Ala- bama National Guardsmen , the Confederate flag sewn over their left breast pockets , leapfrogged the column and covered the crossroads and the culverts and the bridges that the Regular Army demolition men had already searched . At the end of the line , as the open , slat-sided truck with the four latrines on it started to pull back onto the highway , the white marshal named Frank Soracco , from Oakland , Calif. , came running back . " Now listen to me ! " he hollered to three Negroes on the truck . " I do n't want you ridin ' anybody in those toilets ! " " What 's that ? " one Negro said . " You heard me , " Soracco said . " Some people have been ridin ' in those toilets instead of walkin ' . If there 's anybody in those toilets , you stay there until they gel out , and it you 're a half mile hack , you let ' em run . " A half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the Rolen School , a Negro named Frank Haralson came walking across the fields on the left . He is 62 years old , and he has lived around Trickem Fork all his life , and he walks with a cane because , after he fell off a construction job over in Tyler five years ago , they never did get his left ankle set back quite right . From the porch of the four-room cabin where he lives with his wife and the two youngest of his seven children , he had seen the marchers coming away off to the right , and now he was waiting for them under a stand of pine . " If I educated , " Frank Haralson said , " I do n't know  --  oh , Lardy ! ? what I woulda been . My Daddy he put two of his girls through school , and he put me to plowin ' . Then one year he had bad luck . He 'd paid all his debts , and he had nine bale left , and a bale bring fifty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school . Then a fella burned him out , the whole nine bale . and it just an old grudge . " But I never did get on welfare. - Frank Haralson said . " I always did have a little piece of a job . The lowest I ever work was a dollar and a half a day for carpentry work , but then I work me up to two dollar . But if I educated , 1 just do n't know . Maybe I coulda been a blueprint man . " I tell ya , " Frank Haralson said . " Around here the average man just make out . The big fish eat the little fish . I 'm sixty-two now , and they still call me ' Boy . ' There 's a man here , and he 's ninety , and they call him ' Old Man ' . Around here you just go from boy to old man .

I workin ' there in Montgomery in a chair factory at the time . I had transportation , and I picked up many people on the streets . The people practical give up , but they hold out . " So Frank Haralson stood under one of those pine trees and waited for the first row of marchers to reach him . When they did , he walked right out with that cane and stuck out his right hand , and a man in the middle of the front row took it . " Did you ever see Dr. Martin Luther King ? " another man in the front row said to Frank Haralson . " No , sir , " Frank Haralson said . " Well , you 're shaking hands with him now , " the man said . " Oh , Lordy ! " Frank Haralson said . Then Frank Haralson , with his cane , got into the line next to Martin Luther King , and he walked the two and a half miles to the next campsite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Sherrill Smith , a Roman Catholic priest from San Antonio , Tex. , was marching , his aquiline , almost handsome face burned red by the sun , his black raincoat over his right shoulder . his breviary in his hands , his lips moving with the words : " May He not suffer your foot to slip : may He slumber not who guards you . " At seven o'clock that morning the Rev. Sherrill Smith had been standing outside the men 's tent , watching the others in the chow line . The collar of his raincoat was up . and he had his hands deep in the pockets . " How did you sleep . Father ? " a reporter said to him . " Not at all , " he said . smiling . " I was near the tent hap , and it was too cold , so I got up , and I walked around and I stood by the fire . " " Are you the outdoor type ? " " Hardly . " he said , smiling . " Once , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wisconsin , and we caught no fish , and we slept out on the stony ground and got no sleep . I said : ' That 's the last time , brother . ' I was thirty then , and now I 'm forty-three . Unfortunately I 'm also rather fastidious , so I 'd be wrong if I said this is easy . " " I want N'ott to think about something , Father , " the reporter said . " We know why the Negroes are here , and we know why some of the extreme white types are here , but I doubt that you 're an extremist . When I see you again , I 'd like you to tell me exactly why you 're here . " " I know what you mean , " he said , " and I 'll give it thought . " They next saw each other during a 15-minute rest break . The Rev. Sherrill Smith was sitting on his raincoat on a grassy bank on the side of the highway . " I 've been thinking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is here because of what he is himself , and it is n't always easy to explain ourselves .

After the war he was in charge of a group of women in the mail-order department of a chain store . " I was twenty , eight , " he said , " and I was sitting up all night reading theol. ogy and smoking cigarettes , I was engaged Io he married , and it was a difficult decision . It was one Or the other , and I broke my engagement . " From my youth . I was a typical Northerner . I brushed shoulders with Negroes daily , but I never really saw them .

" All I know , " he said , looking right at the reporter . " is that I just had to put my feet on this highway . and I just had to walk . " The marshals were blowing their whistles now , and he got back in line . One of the Negro marshals was holding up an olive-green alpaca-lined jacket . " Whose is this ? " he was shouting . " Whose is this ? " " Leave it there , " the marshal named Soracco said . " But it belongs to somebody , " the other said . " If they 're stupid enough to leave it there , " the marshal named Soracco said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just leave it there . " " It 's mine , " a Negro girl said . " ' Thank you . " T he next day there was a light drizzle sifting down . the earth smell coming up out of the ground when they started out again at eight o'clock . Those who did not have raincoats fashioned coverings out of clear plastic , and where they went through the Big Swamp , U.S. 80 is elevated and the National Guardsmen. in their olive-green ponchos , stood facing away from the marchers and toward the swamp and the tangle of old oaks hung with Spanish moss and the scrub growth and the dwarf palmettos . At 9:55 the rain started , and at 10:25 the big rain hit . It hit with drops as big as quarters , pouring down on them with a great clap of sound . and coming back off the blacktop and crushed-gravel highway in a spray as high as their knees . When it hit , a short sigh went up from the marchers . and then their faces changed . Their faces seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lengthen , and then their mouths opened and the cry came out : " Free-dom ! Free-dom ! Free-dom ! " On the cars of the state troopers and the Army Jeeps and the trucks the headlights were on , and the rain fell on the bedrolls and sleeping bags and blankets and on a maroon flannel blazer with brass buttons , all wedged between the backs of the latrines and the slatted side of the open truck . None of these things ever dried , and the clothes never dried , and the next day , when the sun came out between showers . there were the odors . There was the odor of wet clothing and of unwashed bodieSand ( II Vent ' , I 01 : knees , and there was the sweet smell of the lotion they Tubbed onto im ? , , horned and CVell He:tiled laces They still ? . , I over a brown dog , killed4 by a ear , and I over many a demi yellowhammer . which is the stale bird it Alabama .

They carried flags and banners . Their clothes were clean . The new white faces were unburned by the sun . and the new Negro faces were open with laughter . On the last day there were more than 25,000 marchers and , as they walked through Montgomery sia abreast , they were calling to the Negro women on the old wooden porches along Oak Street . " Come on ! " one old Negro marcher was calling , waving to the women . " Come on ! We 're not afraid ! " At the barricades in front of the state capitol they tilled the plaza of Dexter Avenue . up which . 104 years before , had moved the inaugural parade of Jefferson Davis . president of the Confederacy .

Now he was under it . sniffing up through a hole in the floor , and barking . " They take their sandwich and carry their water . " " What kind of sandwich ? " " Peanut butter mostly , " she said , and then . raising her voice , " Shut up your mouth , dog ! " " Do they always have sandwiches for lunch ? " " No , sir . Sometimes it be a week they do n't have anything . " On top of the blankets on one of the beds there was a book . The title was Neighbors on the Rill , and the name Belva Ann was printed in it in pencil , and the reporter read the first paragraph : " Far out in the country , away up on a hill , there lived a boy named Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big white farmhouse on the hilltop . " " Miss Williams . " the reporter asked , " did you ever go to school ? " hi ? " Yr , . ser . I like it very much . Then in ? inarilma look sick , and they could n't keep me in i he school . " " When you were young , what did you want to he ? " " I wanted to be a teacher . My teacher was Miss Mary Frances Owens , and she was just nice to the children and try to teach them everythin ' , and that 's what I wanted to he . " " What do you hope your children will be ? " " I hope they decide to be teachers or nurses or secretaries , or whatever they like to be . I just do my best to keep ' em in the school . " ? " Have you heard about the Freedom March that went by Trickem Fork last week ? " " Yes , sir . I hear about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to march here ? " " No , sir . " Ella Mae Williams said . " 1 do n't know why they march . " J esse Favor was sitting in Mary Cosby 's general store , a mile north of U.S. 80 where it passes the Trickem Fork oak trees . In Mary Cosby 's general store they sell Cabin Home Corn Meal and Goody 's Headache Powders and Scotch Snuff and Tampa Nugget. cigars and at this time of the year they used to sit around there and talk mostly about the Trickem Eagles . The Trickem Eagles are the New York Yankees of the Lowndes County Baseball League . and Jesse Favor was the Eagles 's first manager . " I 'm a guy like this . " Jesse Favor was saying now , the half dozen others sitting , and standing around , and listening to him . " I always have tried to fight for what I thought . Up to now I 've just been talkin ' , but now I got somebody behind me . " " That 's right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jesse Favor was saying . " It come to me that day in February when the Reverend Bevel came out here from Se/ma . " The Rev. James Bevel is a short , wiry , hard-faced Negro , a Baptist minister out of Dickson . Tenn . He is the Alabama project director of Dr. Martin Luther King 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference . " He come out here right to this store , " Jesse Favor said , " and he said , ' Take me around . ' There were eight people here in this store , " Jesse Favor said . " and most of them just left . That made me mad . " " I remember , " one of the others said . " If just a few of us get registered , " Jesse Favor said , " it wo n't mean much . That 's why we got to get as many of the people as we can to go down . " " ' Muni right , " someone said . Trickem Fork is in Lowndes Counl y , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layneville , 17 forks In I hi . southeasi In Lowndes County the Negroes outnumber I lft , whites almost four to one , hill until the week before the Freedom March not one Negro voter had been registered in Lowndes Count y in 155 years . " We went down there , " one of them Said , - more than thirty of us , to register on the first Monday in March , and they told us one of the registrars was sick , and they did n't know where the other was . We went back on the third Monday , but they would n't let us in the registrar 's office . You know where they had it set up to register us ? " " Where ? " one of the reporters said . in the old jailhouse , They had the two tables set up in this room with the gallows on the left . While you 're fillin ' out the paper , one white man is sayin ' , ' I guess many a guy dropped through there . ' Then another is spyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " And the literacy test was n't easy , " Bill Cosby said . Bill Cosby is 35 now , and he does well . He owns 8 acres , half in cotton , and runs the general store with his wife . He finished the 10th grade and had three years of vocational training . Starting in 1948 , he put in three years , nine months and 27 days in the Army , 33 months and 13 days of that time in Korea and on Okinawa . " And still ca n't vote , " Frank Haralson said . " They gave me hard questions , " Bill Cosby said . " The first was : ' What part does the Vice President play in the Senate and the House ? ' The second was : ' What legal and legislative steps would the State of Alabama and the State of Mississippi have to take to combine into one state ? ' " " In eight hours . " Jesse Favor said , " they registered sixteen . They got to do better than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the march stopped here the people said that for the first time they knew what it 's about , and they 're gon na participate . I know they mean it . because they had their own children in the march . " " They tell us , " Frank Haralson said , " that we better not have the mass meetin ' Sunday night . " " 1 heard that , " Jesse Favor said , " but they always pick some weak mind to tell it to . " " I 'll be there , " Frank Haralson said . " Even if nobody else be there , I 'll be there . " T here were more than 170 of them , men , women and sonic children , there at seven P.M. The day before , Jesse Favor had spent four hours bringing electric cable through the siding of the Mount Gillard Baptist Church , so that the outside of the church would not be shrouded in darkness while they sat inside . " You know how much longer this church is gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coordinating Committee said , standing on the front step . " About two weeks . " " You really think so ? " " A lot of people are gon na get killed . I say , ' Get your soul ready . ' " Inside they filled the worn and scarred oak pews . In the humid air their faces glistened . Up on the plat form , with the altar behind him , sat Jes.se Favor , as recording secretary of l hr Lowndes County Christian Association for Human Rights . " Keep your eyes on the skies . Oh , Lord ! Oh , Lord ! " they were singing . " Keep your eyes on the skies . " " Now I hope , " the first speaker was saying , " that tomorrow morning at eight o'clock we 'll have the same number at the Lowndes County jail-house that we have here tonight . " " I 'd like to say something , " someone else said . " We must have some means of communication for safety , because you never know at what hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should have two-way radios , walkie-talkies , like the people on the other side have . I say this because we 've had quite a few accidents along here on lonely roads where cars have been forced off the road . and people have been beaten to death and then put hack in the car , and the car run off the road like it 's an accident . " " Now you each have an application for voter registration , " the main speaker was saying , holding up the piece of paper . " There 's nothing to be afraid of . It 's just as if you apply for a job . It 's just a questionnaire . What is a questionnaire ? Nothing but a series of questions . You take an oath . What is an oath ? A sworn statement , and you do n't have anything to be dishonest about . Your residence address . What does that mean ? It means where you live . Length of residence . What does this mean ? Not how long your cabin or house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . " " I do believe , " the next speaker was saying , " that somebody out there is spyin ' tonight . I do n't care . whoever you are . The Uncle Toms are the people we got to understand . They are scared , and we got to feel sorry for them . " " As you may be aware , " said a gray-haired man . standing up off to the right , " 1 ca n't see . I went down to register , and I can read and write Braille , but the registrar ca n't read Braille . So I was asked one question . That 's all . Then I got the paper in the mail , and it said I failed . " " All right , then . You should write to the Justice Department and tell them what happened. - " Yes , sir . " " Now , be there tomorrow , all that can , and do n't be ashamed and do n't be afraid . You got nothin ' to be ashamed of , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to mass meetings . because it just ai n't safe . You 're here tonight , so I know you 're not afraid . " Hayneville is a quiet farming town . its streets tree-shaded , its older homes white-painted , its newer ones red-brick ranch types with white trim . The old . two-story , peaked-roofed , red-brick jail sits on a mound at the edge of town . " Now I wanta tell you . " said one of the registrars , in a dark-blue suit and white shirt and dark tie , standing on the front porch of the jail and looking down at the more than 50 Negro faces sweating in the sun and looking up at him , " that 1 welcome you here , because you have a right to be here . " " Yes ! " they said , all in one voice . It was 99:50 in the morning , and some of them had been there since 7 : : 40 . They had conic with then children packed Into their cars , and some ht stuck , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make your application for registration , " the registrar was saying . The other one , in a brown fedora and green zipper jacket . was standing up on the porch with him , along with the deputy sheriff , and nodding . " That 's the law , and we live by the law here . If there arc any outsiders here . from Selma or anywhere , they 're not gon na help you a bit . You do n't need ' em , because were here to respect your rights . Now , there are only two of us here , and were gon na process you as fast as we can . How long it takes depends on you . We had one here last time took an hour and forty minutes . That 's not our fault . " " And if any of you have a record , " the registrar in the five-gallon hat said , " if you 've been in the pen . forget it . You 're wastin ' your time and our time . That 's the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army . " a Negro said . " Ca n't you get more people to make the registrations ? I mean , you only got two . . . . " " Look , " the registrar in the blue suit said . " We do n't get paid much for this job , and I have to leave my own business , and I 'd much rather be there . I 'm here because you 're here . . . . " " But some of these people been here since seven-thirty . They got work to do too . When does this start ? " " It starts ? " the registrar said , " when you 're finished askin ' questions . " They registered them four at a time at two tables in the bare , damp . 15-by15-foot room with the three barred endows and the steps leading up to the sllows on the left . One of them was Mrs. Fannie Robertson , who is white-haired and wears glasses and was born .71 Lowndes County 76 years ago . " Now , that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to the paragraph on the paper . " Be sure you read it before you sign it . " " Yes , sir . " Mrs. Fannie Robertson has seven children and 19 grandchildren and two great grandchildren . She read slowly . following the words with the index finger of her left hand , her head nodding with each word . " It were hard . " - she said later , standing outside with the others , " but when they say everybody can vote in the county , I thought I better try it too . I pays my taxes and everythin ' . " " Right , " somebody else said . Just west of where the road from Hayneville joins U.S. 80 at Lowndesboro , the country ' is gently rolling and . where the marchers had come , one hill looks like another . Already it was difficult to find again the spot , at the right of the highway leading toward Montgomery , where Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was shot and killed the night of the last day of the march , The wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , had weathered and become indistinct , and the grass was growing in them again . The four-strand barbed-wire fence , straddled by the car , had been put back op again , but where the wheel tracks ended someone had placed in the grass , under the bottom strand of barbed wire , a bouquet of now faded pink flowers .
