Bristling at his reputation as a steel-industry maverick , Joseph L. Block recently protested that " we just do what everybody else does , but we try to do it better . " When Block , 65 , steps down this week as chairman of Inland Steel Co. , most people will admit that he has done pretty well . The nation 's seventh biggest steelmaker , Inland has consistently outperformed its larger rivals in such key areas as return on invested capital , and proved itself equal to withstanding economic recessions . <P> As the only major steel producer based in Chicago , Inland has long capitalized on the lucrative Midwest steel market . With all its production concentrated at its huge Indiana Harbor complex in nearby East Chicago , the company sells 70% of its output within a 200-mile radius . In recent years , however , other major steelmakers have rapidly expanded their Chicago-area operations-and Inland has lately been feeling the pinch . <P> Striking Addition . Suffering with the rest of the industry , Inland last week reported that earnings through the year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among other things depressing profits is the cost of Inland 's ambitious modernization , including its first basic-oxygen furnace shop and a new computer-controlled hot-strip mill . His eyes turned toward the future , Joe Block has logged $250 million in capital expenditures over the past two years , huge outlays for a company with an annual sales level of about $1 billion . <P> The grandson of an Inland founder and son of a longtime chairman , Block worked at every end of the business from mill hand up . Elected president in 1953 ( he became chairman in 1959 ) , he strengthened Inland 's tradition as a civic-minded company by playing a prominent part in the fight for Illinois ' fair-employment law , pushing a redevelopment program for East Chicago and , in 1957 , putting up Inland 's 19-story glass-and-steel headquarters , one of the most striking additions to Chicago 's Loop since the Depression . <P> Block made his major reputation as a maverick through his refusal to join the rest of the industry in raising steel prices during the abrasive 1962 confrontation with the Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumbles of other steelmen by denying he was cozying up to the Administration , insisting simply that " it was the wrong time to raise prices . " Since then , he has repeatedly complained that Washington has made steel its " favorite whipping boy , " last year pointedly took the industry lead in raising steel prices . <P> Dominant Role . Inland is far from being a family company , but the Block clan , which owns less than 5% of the stock , has long played a dominant role in its fortunes . Chosen last week to succeed Joe Block was his cousin , Vice Chairman Philip D. Block Jr. , 61 , whose father was Inland 's first president . Having worked so long in Joe 's shadow , Phil is regarded as a chip off the old Block who will pretty much continue his predecessor 's policies .
