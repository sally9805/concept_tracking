PAPA HEMINGWAY by A. E. Hotchner , 304 pages , Random House . $5.95 . <P> <P> In an acerbic legal dustup , Ernest Hemingway 's widow Mary tried in vain to enjoin publication of this book , contended that A. E. Hotchner had appropriated literary material that rightfully belonged to her as Hemingway 's beneficiary , and accused Hotchner of " shameless penetration into my private life and the usurpation of it for money " ( TIME , Feb. 11 ) . Hotchner certainly will make money from this book : serialization rights were sold to the Saturday Evening Post for about $50,000 , it is a Book-of-the-Month Club selection , and , with 60,000 copies in print , it is clearly destined for the bestseller lists . <P> It deserves to be there , for Hotchner , who has had only so-so success in adapting some of Hemingway 's works for movies and TV , has now produced a rousing good book . This is no definitive biography , and Hotchner 's prose is often second-rate Hemingway , but he still has succeeded in giving an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unsynchronized Passion . Hemingway himself was , of course , his own greatest creation-the archetype of all Hemingway heroes . A big , burly man with heavy shoulders and hugely muscled arms , he was 48 and still radiating an aura of fun and well-being when he and Hotchner first met in Cuba in 1948 . For the next 13 years they were inseparable friends . Although he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 for The Old Man and the Sea and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954 , they were not Hemingway 's most creative years . Yet he was busy and active . He and Hotch went fishing off Cuba , journeyed to Paris and Spain , toured the bullfight circuit and ran with the bulls in Pamplona , hunted together in Ketchum , Idaho . All the time , Hotch was taking copious notes on his unique , complicated and often buffoonish friend . <P> He noted that Hemingway never wore underwear and seldom bathed in water ; he preferred sponge baths with rubbing alcohol . Hotch listened patiently when Papa told tales about his sex life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that he had once shacked up with Mata Hari ( obviously untrue , since 41-year-old Mata Hari was executed in 1917 , a year before Ernest , then 18 , got to Europe as an ambulance driver on the Italian front ) . On one occasion , Papa boasted drunkenly that he had sired a child by an African bride whom he had acquired on a safari ( possibly true ) . What does ring completely true is Hemingway 's comment in 1948 about Marlene Dietrich : " The thing about the Kraut and me is that we have been in love since 1934 . . . but we 've never been to bed . Victims of unsynchronized passion . " <P> Papa had a bad temper , says Hotch . When he drank , he sometimes grew quarrelsome and querulous with his fourth wife , " Miss Mary , " whom he adored and once described as " my pocket Rubens . " He slyly made sport of pestering strangers by extravagantly praising something they wore . He was also a hypochondriac , forever lugging around samples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer ( his own diagnosis ) , and grew his beard to cover the white scaling on his face .
