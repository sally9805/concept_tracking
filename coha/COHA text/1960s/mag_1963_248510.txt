In Santo Domingo , Cellist Pablo Casals , 86-whose Ministry of State is music-resumed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic , conducting Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony at a festival concert before an overflow crowd in the Palacio de Bellas Artes . Under the Trujillo dictatorship , said Casals , such a visit would have been impossible , but " I am proud to come to this country that has obtained its liberty . " Leading a tumultuous final ovation were Dominican President Juan Bosch , 53 , and Puerto Rican Governor Luis Muoz Marn , 65 , who arranged the appearance as a " spiritual gift " to the Dominican people . <P> Backstage at the Valley Forge Music Fair , Pennsylvania Governor William W. Scranton , 45 , had to take off his hat to Actress Mamie Van Doren , 30 . The State G.O.P. gleaned $100,000 from a $100-a-plate Straw Hat Spectacular . And Mamie , an after-dinner treat in Silk Stockings , turned out to be the best dish of all , adding her own gossamer footnote to history . " My dressing room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't talk much . I thought he was a little flushed when he came in . Then I told him I was a Republican , and he gave me a big smile . " <P> Ill lay : Herbert Hoover , 88 , condition serious , " due to anemia secondary to bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract , " at home in his Waldorf-Astoria apartment ; G.

Brown , 67 , Ohio 's senior Congressman , suffering " a severe back strain , " abed at Bethesda Naval Hospital ; Queen Ingrid of Denmark , 53 , with mild stomach ulcers , abandoning all engagements in favor of rest and diet , at her summer residence , Fredensborg Castle . <P> Headed for stardom , she wheeled around Hollywood in a Thunderbird , collected a sizable list of screen credits ( Francis of Assisi , Where the Boys Are , Lisa ) , and made $50,000 playing a jet-paced stewardess in her most recent movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 24 , fame and flight pay were not enough . Each year since 1958 , she has spent four weeks at a Roman Catholic retreat . Last week , making the break complete , Dolores slipped away from the movie colony to enter Regina Laudis Monastery in Bethlehem , Conn. , as a postulant . Said the nun-to-be : " I am not leaving anyone or anything behind . I am taking with me a full and grateful heart . " <P> " He looks like his grandfather , and he plays with some of that same determination . " Thus his high school coach predicts college stardom for Charles Cobb , 17 , a protean redhead and grandson of baseball 's alltime great , Ty Cobb , who died in 1961 . But if there is another " Georgia Peach " ripening , baseball scouts are too late to pick him . Bidding for grid fame instead , young Cobb , a halfback , has signed for a football grant-in-aid at Georgia Tech . Would Grandpa approve ? Sure enough , says Charlie , recalling a long-ago story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanderbilt U. : " He put on the pads and made a touchdown the first time he got the ball . "
