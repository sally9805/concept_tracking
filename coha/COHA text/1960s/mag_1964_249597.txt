Pamela Mason , the all-but-divorced wife of Actor James Mason , is an English-born , middle-aged chatterbox whose very conversation is constructed like a Hollywood gossip column . Mostly , she has confined her monologues to parties and daily appearances on radio and TV , but neither medium was just the right setting for a woman with Pamela 's natural dagger-turn of phrase . Last week she announced that she was about to be put in her proper place at last . Soon , she said , she will begin writing a Hollywood column just like Hedda and Lolly .

" I do opinion . Movie-star gossip is n't interesting unless you 're having an affair with Richard Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she is . Her two-word review of Irving Shulman 's biography of Jean Harlow was : " Shocking puce . " Her general code is : " You should be vicious only if you have something to be vicious about . " And-regardless of whether it is called gossip or opinion-she sees no reason not to be vicious about actors if she wants to be . " I do n't think actors have any right to private lives , " she says . " If they want to have privacy , they should n't be actors . I do n't like cowards who stick their necks out and then scream and run . You ca n't have it both ways . " <P> As for Hedda and Louella , she says : " I challenge them , because they 're passe . Louella has a gushing attitude toward the whole industry and neither she nor Hedda writes her own column . Hedda 's not a writer . I am . I 've written books and novels . " She has , at that .
