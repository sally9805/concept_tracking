A year ago , a committee of impartial experts reported to Surgeon General Luther L. Terry that " cigarette smoking is a health hazard " and warrants " appropriate remedial action . " Last week a dozen voluntary health organizations that have joined with three agencies of the Federal Government in a National Interagency Council on Smoking and Health met in Washington to assess what " remedial action " has been taken . <P> On the legislative level , the few proposals aimed at curbing cigarette consumption have been buried in committee . Last week Washington 's Senator Warren Magnuson proposed that all cigarette packages be marked with a danger label . Whether such a law can get past Democratic legislators from Southern tobacco states remains to be seen . <P> At the administrative level , the Fed eral Trade Commission was ready to require the same sort of labeling that Magnuson is now asking for . But the FTC was urged by Congress to postpone any ruling until next spring . President Johnson , who quit smoking after his 1955 heart attack , made no mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised an all-out attack on every major ill known to man . <P> For Squares . On the propaganda and persuasion level , though , the mills were grinding . Dr. Terry noted that 350,000 copies of his report were distributed during the year .

Cigarette stocks fell ; cigarette sales dropped by 10% . But slowly , smoking has edged back toward its previous level . Total sales for 1964 are expected to be about 3% below the 1963 mark . And cigarette stocks rose in the wake of last week 's Interagency press conference . But for Dr. Terry , even those rising statistics included reasons for optimism . " If we take into consideration the 3,000,000 increase in population , " he said , " the drop in total cigarette consumption is substantial . " <P> Surveys in both 1955 and 1962 showed that 59% of American men smoked cigarettes , said Dr. Terry . In the fall of 1964 , a similar survey showed only 52% smoking .
