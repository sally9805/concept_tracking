txt /30 Analysis of the Rorschach tion with either sex . In the case of the three women each had difficulty or confusion in accepting her role as a woman . Apparently , from the 150 few cases in this study , failure to achieve marriage is related to some disturbance in accepting one 's sex role . Of the twenty subjects who are married , six have no children , five have one child , eight have two chidren , and one has three children . Nothing in the Rorschach records could be found to indicate that those who had two or three children were better adjusted sexually than those who had one or no child . Subject 29 , who has borne three children , is described as emotionally immature , and although the identification is feminine it is the feminity of a young girl , not an adult woman . Similarly , those with two children are variously characterized as immature , sexually repressed , having strong fear of sex , exhibitionistic , inadequate sexually . Apparently the ability to have children should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of feeling and libidinal involvement . If one may generalize from this small sample , one must conclude that most people are far from experiencing the full enjoyment of sex . Some approach sex timidly , unsure of themselves and of their role in sexual relations . Some engage in sex reluctantly , with loathing and fear , some , because of their inhibition toward sexual experience , their distaste for it , and their lack of self-assurance , are driven to find sexual release in distorted ways such as in exhibitionistic display or in various perverse practices . If this is true , and there is reason to believe it is true , what are the implications ? Does it imply that such individuals are undersexed and lacking in normal potency ? This conclusion can not be drawn . But it does imply that the experiences of infancy , childhood , and adolescence have suppressed , cramped , and distorted sexual expression . Most of these individuals have been forced by experience to repress their sexual impulses and to find forms of sex-role identification that prevent them from enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be in part a lack of sex education , but more importantly it represents attitudes that have been formed through interpersonal relationships , primarily in the family . In general , this is not the picture that we have of people , and one could not draw these conclusions from the interviews in this study . It is not the custom or practice for people to discuss their sexual feelThe // their outward expression was particularly true for aggression . The Rorschach sometimes indicated strong aggressive or hostile tendencies which were not revealed in the interview . It is well known that those individuals with the strongest reaction formations of politeness and courtesy may have underlying aggressive tendencies . Likewise , a person may seem outwardly to be at ease in his social relations , but may experience discomfort in his relations with others and lack genuine warmth and depth of feeling . However , those with vivid , lively , outgoing personalities tended to show good social adjustment on the Rorschach , while those with restrained , reserved personalities showed poor social adjustment on the Rorschach . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mental functioning as diagnosed from the Rorschach and as observed in real life . Estimates of affect from the Rorschach showed some correspondence with the interviewer 's estimates of energy level , vivacity , and similar " dynamic " qualities of personality . There was low but recognizable agreement between control as diagnosed on the Rorschach and control or emotional restraint as diagnosed in the personality . Similarly , there was a definite correlation ( r = +.4o ) between drive and energy level as diagnosed from the Rorschach and as observed in real life . The Rorschach has long been known to be useful in estimating level and quality of mental functioning , intelligence , judgment , organizational ability , and imagination , and although the relationship was not as high in the present study as has been reported elsewhere , ' there was definite agreement with intelligence estimates of the interviewer , and there was also a correlation of +.34 with I.Q.

This is mainly due to the fact that the interview reports did not summarize specifically the observer 's impressions of self-confidence or feelings of inferiority , and trying to make estimates from snatches of self-reference phrases that a subject might have used and which were included in the report were entirely too un ' P.

One can not say that a relation between Rorschach and observer estimates of attitudes toward the self does not exist , but only that evidence was insufficient to assert it . One usually thinks of the Rorschach as providing evidence concerning anxiety ? Here again the observer 's reports concerning anxiety leave much to be desired . Anxiety in most persons does not take the form of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics by a variety of defense mechanisms . It is indeed difficult to estimate a person 's anxiety by a single interview with him . Rorschach estimates of anxiety may not correspond with the superficial impressions left on an interviewer . The same can be said about depression . But here one wonders that the relationship is not closer . Depression was diagnosed in fourteen subjects from the Rorschach and was noted by the interviewer in nine subjects , but there were only four subjects who had depressed tendencies from both sources of evidence . If one might hazard a broad generalization he could say that there is definite agreement between the Rorschach and direct observation in those aspects of personality which make a definite impression on an observer ? the liveliness , animation , intelligence , spontaneity . But in the tendencies about which the subject may be sensitive and which he has repressed , disguised , or brought under control ? psychosexual adjustment , sex-role identity , aggression , anxiety , relations with people ? the relationship may be low . This is not to deny the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance the value of a Rorschach diagnosis because it may point to trends which find expression only when stress brings them into play . They may nevertheless still be very important ingredients in the underlying personality structure . It is possible that a finer differentiation of the Rorschach diagnoses according to whether the interpretation comes from formal analysis or content might indicate that those two kinds of interpretation may have their own distinct contributions . The Picture-Story Test also furnishes evidence as to the latent , underlying impulses and wish life of a person which may or may not correspond to his observable behavior and personality . The Picture2 Abraham Elizur , " Content Analysis of the Rorschach with Regard to Anxiety and Hostility , " Journal of Projective Techniques , XIII ( 1949 ) , 247-84. // Story Test , in addition , can portray only those wishes and impulses that a subject can put into words to characterize another person ( projection ) . Because of this projective factor the picture-story method may reveal traits and impulse tendencies which a person might deny as pertaining to himself but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In general , content in the Picture-Story Test reveals considerable information about the sex wish-life , sex-role identity , self-attitudes , and Oedipal relationships . In some respects this material is closer to the surface in the Picture-Story Test than in the Rorschach reports . On the Picture-Story Test a person may reveal his attitudes and feelings toward the opposite sex , the same sex , or marriage , even though he may not express these feelings in his real-life adjustment . One can tell whether the subject identifies with the male or female figures in a picture , but this does not necessarily tell one whether there is masculine or feminine identification in real life . A man may clearly identify with female characters in the pictures and betray this interest in his dress , gestures , or mannerisms ? but give the world the impression that he is a rugged masculine type of individual by his activities , occupation , and interests . The Picture-Story Test also reveals feelings of inferiority or selfconfidence as well as Oedipal material . Content from the Picture-Story Test yields little concerning social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning , but these may be diagnosed from the formal aspects of the stories . However , even if such diagnosis shows that these factors are present in the impulse and wish life of a person , one can not be sure how they will be expressed in personality . As has been observed before , the relation may be inverse : if a person can express himself openly and freely he may have little need to fantasy and his stories may be meager and restricted , but if his behavior is inhibited , then his impulses may find free expression in overelaborated fantasy . The same comments also apply to anxiety and depression . Depression was a theme in the stories of twenty-three subjects . Ira some of these depression came out clearly in the interview reports , but in others there was no mention of depression , although it might have been noted if one were alert to its manifestations . This is also true of anxiety and the comment about anxiety with reference to the Rorschach applies equally to the Picture-Story Test . // Though there was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test , in many instances this agreement was very low or altogether absent . The Rorschach provides evidence as to basic psychosexual attitudes and feelings whereas the Picture-Story Test tells how these attitudes and feelings work themselves out with reference to social adjustments and marriage . The Picture-Story Test provides content that must be guessed at from the Rorschach . On the other hand , whereas the Rorschach presents a very discouraging over-all picture of psychosexual adjustment , this would not have been guessed from the Picture-Story Test . In general , where sex role is prominently revealed in the PictureStory Test there is good agreement with the Rorschach . On the whole , the Picture-Story Test agrees rather faithfully with the Rorschach diagnosis of attitudes toward the self , and fills in some of the content or meaning of the Rorschach estimate . When the Picture-Story Test is interpreted from its formal factors , agreement with the Rorschach is most apparent . Rorschach indicators of good social adjustment , for example , are correlated for the most part with richness of fantasy , elaborateness of plot , and absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to affect there is some indication that those who show repression and dissociation of feeling on the Rorschach also show paucity of feeling on the Picture-Story Test . Some slight relationship was also noted between elaborateness , freedom , and spontaneity of a set of stories , and the quality of mental functioning as diagnosed from the Rorschach . But for other factors little or no relationship was noted between the Rorschach and the Picture-Story Test . Very little correspondence was found between short , stereotyped , stimulus-bound stories on the PictureStory Test and control as diagnosed from the Rorschach . Likewise , whether a story was long and animated or short and restrained seemed to have little relationship to drive and energy level as diagnosed on the Rorschach . More surprising and difficult to explain is the complete lack of relationship between ratings on anxiety or on depression in the two tests . Still more difficult to understand is the discrepancy among ratings on aggression . According to the Rorschach these subjects possess a great deal of underlying aggression and hostility although it may be bottled up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1953 stories on the Picture-Story Test were noteworthy for absence of aggression , which was noticeably different from the amount of aggression in the stories of these same individuals in adolescence . Apparently , control and repressive tendencies influence the expression of aggression on the Picture-Story Test to a considerably greater extent than on the Rorschach . One may summarize by saying that both the Rorschach and the Picture-Story Test provide evidence as to the underlying impulse and wish life of a person . In some ways the Rorschach , because of its unstructured nature , furnishes evidence that may be a little more basic but is often difficult to translate into terms that have meaning in actual personality . The Picture-Story Test , on the other hand , presents the wishes and impulses that the subject can put into words . If wishes and impulses are unacceptable they may not find expression even in fantasy . This may mean that often they are not as basic as the trends revealed on the Rorschach but they have the advantage of showing how the trend is thought of with regard to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in personality . 9 . Prediction of Mental Health One of the questions which it was hoped that this follow-up study of Adolescent Fantasy would answer is whether it is possible to predict general adjustment or mental health from the data which were gathered in 1940 . Unfortunately , the Rorschach was not given in 1940 , but there are available from the earlier period the results of the Picture-Story Test , the subjects ' autobiographies , interviews with the mother or guardian , statements from teachers and other school officials , and general observations by the workers in the study . In 1940 rankings were made of adjustment by Symonds , by Wexler and Silverman combined ( Wexler ranking the boys and Silverman the girls ) , by Mrs. Muriel I. Chamoulaud ; and then a composite was made from the three sets of rankings . In 1953 rankings were made by both Jensen and Symonds separately on general adjustment from the material in the interviews , adjustment as judged from the Picture-Story Test , and adjustment as judged from the Rorschach . In addition , Mrs. Dudek ranked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known how much contamination there is in the rankings of Symonds and Jensen . The Symonds rankings were made several months apart ; even so it is difficult to make an unbiased estimate from one set of data when one is familiar with the other data on the same subject . Composite rankings were also prepared by combining the rankings on adjustment as gathered from the interviews , the Picture-Story Test , and the Rorschach reports . Rank difference intercorrelations , computed from the 14 variables , are presented in Table 16 . From this table of intercorrelations one learns that the correlation between the composite of the 1940 rankings for adjustment and the composite of the 1953 rankings for adjustment // is .54 . This is the figure that comes closest to answering the general question posed at the beginning of this chapter . Whether this is a high or low relationship depends very much on one 's point of view . It is far from a perfect relationship and also far from a chance relationship . It compares very closely with the level of relationship which is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available today , and as a measure of prediction is quite creditable . This means that predictions made of mental health from evidence available during adolescence have considerable significance some thirteen years later . figure The correlations of the Rorschach made by Mrs. Dudek are considerably lower than the other correlations in the study , and one is forced to conclude that Mrs. Dudek based her judgment on factors which differed from the other two workers who studied those data . The correlation between the rankings of Jensen and Symonds on the Rorschach was .84 , and on the Picture-Story Test .75 . But the /78 Prediction of Mental Health correlation between their rankings on general adjustment from the interviews was only .34 . This will be the subject for later comment . The correlations between general adjustment from the interviews and adjustment from the Picture-Story Test were in the middle range , those between the rankings of Symonds being .46 and Jensen .45 . But the correlations between general adjustment from interviews and from the Rorschach tended to be lower , those for Symonds being .41 and for Jensen .15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Rorschach were considerably higher-.66 for Symonds and .68 for Jensen . Apparently there is considerable correlation between the results on the two projective techniques . The low correlation of .34 between the rankings of Symonds and Jensen on general adjustment from the interviews deserves a further look , because if it is not possible for two individuals using the same data to agree any better on what is meant by adjustment than this figure indicates , then the possibility of prediction is open to grave question . With regard to the rankings on general adjustment , Jensen has made the following statement . My initial rankings were made without consideration of the test materials . They were influenced perhaps too much by the degree to which the subject was living the kind of life expected of an adult and seemed to be meeting adult responsibilities successfully . For this reason some of the still unmarried subjects are ranked lower than they would have been otherwise . Also an element of " success " entered my ranking ? those who seemed to have managed their lives well , have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , have been able to acquire a house and car and have become responsible citizens of the community were ranked higher than those who have not taken on as many adult responsibilities or have not been as successful in meeting the demands of such responsibility . All of these are rather superficial criteria of " adjustment " perhaps , and any ranking would have to be considerably changed if it were based on my knowledge of the whole case including the test materials . Symonds based his rankings on three criteria : ( i ) success in terms of well-rounded living , ( 2 ) happiness , and ( 3 ) ego strength in terms of freedom from neuroticism . Each of these requires extended definition , of course , and I did not have the necessary data to make entirely accurate rankings on criteria of this sort . It soon became evident that ratings on the three criteria did not agree , as far as the evidence perPrediction of Mental Health /79 mitted me to judge . Probably the evidence was clearest with regard to the external and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married and there were children in the family , his education , the level of his occupation and roughly his success in it , the kind of community and house he lived in , and whether or not he owned a car . But when it comes to the matter of happiness , the data do not permit such easy judgments . One does not wear his unhappiness on his sleeve , and many of the subjects tried and were successful in giving Dr. Jensen an impression that all was going well with them when , if the truth were known , there was much unhappiness that was not revealed . As it was , a large number of the subjects showed evidences of depression in one way or another . It was obvious that Ralph ( 2 ) , who had not yet finished his education and was unmarried , Jerome ( 7 ) , who complained about dissatisfaction over his job , Roger ( 8 ) , who felt that he was capable of more than the world gave him credit for , Dorothy ( 30 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , and both Natalie ( 21 ) and Nancy ( 3 I ) , who complained that life was dull and drab , can all be classed as unhappy . But what about both Barbara ( 20 ) and Celia ( 28 ) , neither of whom is married , although they are vaguely concerned about it , but have vigorous , outgoing personalities and are successful in their work ? are they unhappy ? Or John ( 39 ) , who is obviously very disturbed sexually and is unmarried , but prides himself on his feminine conquests and is apparently successful in his work ? is he unhappy ? Or Mabel ( 22 ) , who lives in a better-than-average home and is able to have a full-time maid to do all of the housework and look after the children , but who admitted tensions between herself and her husband . Is she happy ? And is Seymour ( 36 ) , a postman with little ambition whose wife makes all the major decisions , unhappy ? Should Pansy ( 29 ) , who married out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very inferior neighborhood with obvious poor relations with her neighbors , but who has three children , be termed unhappy ? Isabel ( i8 ) , unmarried , lives quietly at home with her parents , has worked ten years in a bank , likes to sew , enjoys music , is a devout Catholic and has very little to do with men . Is she unhappy ? These are difficult if not impossible questions to answer . In fact , I doubt that these individuals themselves could give an unqualified answer if the question 18o Prediction of Mental Health were put to them . There may be vague currents of unrest and dissatisfaction , but on the other hand each of them enjoys many aspects of life that give considerable satisfaction and which they would not willingly change . With all of the complexity of human living , it is impossible to state unqualifiedly for oneself that one is or is not happy , to say nothing of assigning such a designation to another person . The question of ego strength and freedom from neurotic tendencies is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , who was diagnosed on the basis of the Rorschach as paranoid schizophrenic and who impressed the observers as very queer , none of the subjects of the study can be classified as being neurotic or psychotic in the sense that they have pronounced symptoms . Two subjects have undergone psychotherapy , indicating that their problems have been serious enough to prompt them to seek professional assistance . Catherine ( 12 ) consulted a psychiatrist because she had become very nervous and found it difficult to sleep . She was also concerned because she was frigid . Psychotherapy has removed these difficulties and Catherine is quite satisfied over the outcome . Albert ( 40 ) was undergoing psychoanalytic therapy at the time of the study . He sought help because of his difficulty in holding a job , but he also stated that it has helped him in his relations with girls . None of the subjects can be said to have anxiety neurosis , phobia , hysteria , hypochondriasis , neurasthenia , obsessive-compulsive neurosis , or character disorder . None has a serious psychosomatic disorder . Except for Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But isolated signs or symptoms of all of these can be found among the subjects . Ten subjects reported that they are tense , nervous , worriers . Ralph ( z ) has a nervous stomach which gives him gastritis when under stress , particularly the stress of examinations . Roy ( 6 ) had high blood pressure while in the Navy and it is likely to recur now when he is under stress . Sam ( 9 ) , although in many respects making a good adjustment , reports that he is basically a rather nervous person , had " battle fatigue " while overseas in the Army , and now tends to worry about his mother , who is a very nervous person . Laura ( 13 ) is reported as tense and nervous , and Viola ( 14 ) tends to lose weight under stress . Stella ( 19 ) , a frequent worrier , becomes nervous and depressed under stress . Dorothy ( 30 ) speaks of butterflies in her stomach . Seymour ( 36 ) has a nervous stomach and suffers attacks of indigestion under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 40 ) refers to his nervous tension and smoked nervously during the interviews . Nine of the subjects reported that they were subject to more or less severe depression . Two of the subjects , Stella ( i9 ) and Nancy ( 31 ) , reported cyclic tendencies ? alternating periods of hyperexcitability and good feeling with more or less severe depression . Margaret ( 24 ) , an otherwise healthy person , reported fear of high places and going up and down stairs , and Seymour ( 36 ) a fear of snakes . While most of the men cautiously admitted that they would take a social drink now and then , none would admit that he drank heavily at the present time , except Albert ( 40 ) . However , Karl ( I i ) boasted about his drinking prowess and his ability to hold his liquor ; and Edwin ( 33 ) , Jimmy ( 37 ) , and Albert ( 4o ) each stated that he drank heavily during the war while he was in the service . From these scattered bits of evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Apparently at the present time all are able to function in a fairly satisfactory manner . But what any individual might do in a state of emergency or under severe stress is hard to say . All of the above symptoms were taken into account in making the rankings , but just how much ' weight they should have in connection with estimates of success and happiness as measures of mental health is debatable . The relatively low correlation of .34 between the rankings of Jensen and Symonds points up the difficulty of estimating the mental health or adjustment of an adult . It was believed that some of the factors which might be responsible for the low correlation could be isolated if close inspection was made of those subjects for whom there was the greatest discrepancy in the rankings . Wallace ( i ) : Jensen ranking z 3 , Symonds 2 , discrepancy 21 . Jensen had difficulties in the two interview and test sessions with this subject . He found Wallace hostile , critical of psychology , and resentful , although he became more friendly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an " authoritarian personality . " Symonds , on the other hand , from the record judged Wallace to be fairly successful , having a good job and living in a new modern house with his wife and child . His aggressiveness could be counted an asset , even though it may betoken an underlying inferiority . Viola ( 14 ) : Jensen ranking zs , Symonds 9 , discrepancy i6 . This // subject also gave Jensen a difficult time in that she took more time in her interviews and tests than any other subject except one . She tended to be very exact and compulsively accurate , and spent much time hunting for the right word . Jensen found that she lived in a world of fantasy ; he did not believe that she had her feet firmly on the ground . He called her a poetic type . Symonds , on the other hand , noted that she was well mated , had two children , and was pregnant at the time of the study . Her high energy level tended to give her a dynamic quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Symonds 26 , discrepancy i6 . Jensen found Edwin to be very relaxed and not bothered by much of anything , which gave the impression of a high degree of stability . He is married and has one child . Symonds noted that Edwin was very ineffective and easygoing , had a mediocre job as inside salesman , and possessed pronounced feelings of inferiority . Roger ( 8 ) : Jensen ranking 2 , Symonds i6 , discrepancy 14 . Jensen found Roger a soft-spoken , pleasant man , not openly assertive , with whom he felt comfortable . Symonds noted from the record that he was anxious and depressed . Although trained as a civil engineer , he holds an inferior job and has strong feelings of inadequacy . His wife teaches to help augment the family 's earnings . Olive ( 27 ) : Jensen ranking 9 , Symonds 23 , discrepancy 14 . Jensen found Olive robust and friendly , but she was very inhibited and for this reason difficult to interview . Symonds noted especially her repressed , depressed personality , her limited intellect , and pretensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking i i , Symonds 24 , discrepancy 13 . Jensen found Seymour good-natured , easygoing and happily mated . Symonds noted that he lacked ambition and was ineffectual vocationally . He tended to have gastritis under stress . Celia ( 28 ) : Jensen ranking zz , Symonds i i , discrepancy i1 . Jensen observed that Celia was not married , was afraid of men , and held prudish sex standards . She was afraid of hurting other people 's feelings . Symonds noted that she was attractive , refined , successful in her work , and competitive with men . Catherine ( 12 ) : Jensen ranking 15 , Symonds 5 , discrepancy io . Jensen found Catherine subjective , self-centered , vague , with excessive fantasy . She was somewhat anxious about her pregnancy . Symonds // noted that although she had earlier not been able to show hostility toward her mother , as a result of psychotherapy she was able to verbalize this and the treatment had also helped her to overcome a condition of sexual frigidity. figure As one reviews the discrepancies it becomes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on personal likes and dislikes and on personal preferences and tastes in what is acceptable in people . Jensen , for instance , undervalues persons with push and nervous energy , who illustrate the " authoritarian personality " ; and he tends to overvalue persons who are relaxed and easygoing . Apparently , in spite of what Jensen stated , he gave less attention to position and worldly success . Jensen tended to give poorer rankings to women who had not made good sexual adjustments . Symonds , on the other hand , tended to overevaluate men who were assertive , and gave poorer rankings to men lacking ambition , who were vocationally less successful , and who Symonds , Interviews Svmonds , Picture-Story Test Symonds , Rorschach 1953 1953 1953 1953 1953 // showed signs of feelings of inferiority . Symonds also tended to give better rankings than Jensen to women with neurotic tendencies which showed up in sexual repression . This comparison and analysis indicated clearly that evaluations of mental health are a function of the evaluator 's own predilections and may be indicative of basic trends within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjectivity of these 1953 rankings of adjustment by Jensen and Symonds , that the correlation between the composite of their two rankings and the 1940 composite ranking was .54 . There is an element of contamination in this correlation , inasmuch as rankings by Symonds appear in both factors , although thirteen years apart . But the correlation of Jensen 's rankings with the 1940 composite is .44 . One must conclude that taking an average of two or more evaluations tends to strike out the personal idiosyncrasies in the rankings of any one individual , with the result that the composite picture is not only more accurate , but also yields higher predictions of adjustment . The lack of perfect correlation between the three measures was to be expected , and naturally part of the discrepancy can be attributed to the unreliability of the judgments . But a closer inspection of the discrepancies may throw further light on the different things that the judgments measure . First , let us look at some of the larger discrepancies between rankings on adjustment from interviews and from the Picture-Story Test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they show marked characteristics in common . Dorothy ( 30 ) : interview ranking 22.5 , PST ranking 4 , discrepancy 18.5 . Barbara ( 20 ) : interview ranking 16.5 , PST ranking 4 , discrepancy 12.5 . Celia ( 28 ) : interview ranking 16.5 , PST ranking 4 , discrepancy 12.5 . All three are sexually maladjusted in real life . Barbara and Celia are unmarried and are repressed sexually . Dorothy , although married , complains of the impotence of her husband , although there is reason to believe that she may be inhibited in her own sexual responsiveness . The Picture-Story Test of all three shows a good deal in common . Each told stories of longing for love , romance , and marriage , which are interpreted as indicating normal , healthy longings . There is sibling rivalry in each . Celia 's stories show a good deal of ambition and striving , while those of Barbara depict a strong-willed woman who is stronger than a man . Dorothy 's stories , although showing a yearning for romance , are more subtle // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sweetness . John ( 39 ) : interview ranking 9.5 , PST ranking 25 , discrepancy 15.5 ? Although he is obviously sexually maladjusted , his adjustment ranking is good because of his success in his work . But his stories lay bare his sexual inadequacies , with strong hostilities toward women . Jensen said that they had a psychopathic flavor with indications of latent homosexuality . Mabel ( 22 ) : interview ranking 1 , PST ranking 14 , discrepancy 13 . She was given a good ranking from the interviews because she had a good home , was married , and had three children , although there were indications that there was tension with her husband . The stories , however , depicted a cruel father , rejecting mother , and sibling rivalry , and were meager , showing much repression . From this brief comparison of large discrepancies between the rankings on adjustment from the record and from the Picture-Story Test , one can conclude that there is a tendency to overestimate adjustments from the Picture-Story Test when normal , healthy longings are depicted , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is also a tendency to - underestimate the adjustment when the stories show much aggressiveness , hostility , and violence , which may be finding release in fantasy and are not characteristics of the person in real life . On the other hand , there is perhaps a tendency to overestimate some of the superficial indications of successful living in real life , which may hide some of the conflicts , tensions , and anxieties underneath . The same individuals appeared at the top of the list showing discrepancies between the rankings for adjustment as based on general interview observation and the Rorschach reports . Dorothy ( 30 ) : interview ranking 22.5 , Rorschach 7 , discrepancy 15.5 . Barbara ( 20 ) : interview ranking 16.5 , Rorschach 2 , discrepancy 14.5 . Celia ( 28 ) : interview ranking 16.5 , Rorschach 3 , discrepancy 13.5 . Isabel ( 18 ) : interview ranking 24 , Rorschach 7 , discrepancy 17 . The Rorschach ranking of each of these was well up toward better adjustment . Dorothy was described in the Rorschach reports as ambitious , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sexually frigid ; Barbara was noted as having high vitality and buoyancy , with good social and personal adjustment ; and Celia was spoken of as intelligent , interesting , and imaginative , but with a vague concept of herself as a woman . Isabel , t 86 Prediction of Mental Health on the other hand , was described from the Rorschach as a restrained , controlled , and proper person , somewhat passive and dependent . All four of these are unmarried women who have obvious sexual inhibitions , which gave them low rankings on general adjustment . But Mabel ( 22 ) - interview ranking 1 , Rorschach 21 , discrepancy 2o ? who shows external signs of successful living , although with some marital tensions , is spoken of from the Rorschach as immature , anxious , with an aggressive drive and concern with prestige . Stella ( to ) ? interview ranking 4.5 , Rorschach 17.5 , discrepancy 13 ? said to be happy in marriage although she gets nervous under stress , is described by the Rorschach as oppositional , immature , unpredictable , and suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 ? interview ranking 12 , Rorschach 25 , discrepancy 13 ? although her interview ranking is not particularly good since she is described as drab and listless , finding life dull , is described in the Rorschach as having poor contact with reality , as oppositional and demanding , with a mild schizophrenic process . There is a tendency to overestimate adjustment on the Rorschach when the Rorschach record is a good one , having many W , M , FC , and F+ responses , even though there may be signs of sexual or aggressive inadequacy . On the other hand , the Rorschach may underestimate adjustment when there are indications of pathology as , for instance , a possible schizophrenic process or when there are FM signs of immaturity . But , as stated before , there may be a tendency to overestimate superficially good marital or aggressive adjustments in work as indications of good emotional adjustment , and to underestimate nervous signs or difficulties in social adjustment as possible indications of poor emotional adjustment . This method of studying the discrepancies in the rankings can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rorschach because the correlation between them is so high ? .79 . Most of the discrepancies are small , and an inspection of the two highest does not suggest any significant trends . In the case of Isabel ( 18 ) , the PictureStory-Test ranking is 13.5 points lower ( less creditable ) than for the Rorschach ; whereas for Catherine ( 12 ) the ranking is 1 i points higher on the Picture-Story Test . In both instances the discrepancy apparently is due to nothing more than differences in judgment and interpretation of the records . In summary , a coefficient of correlation of .54 was found between the Prediction of Mental Health 187 4 1 estimates of adjustment made when the subjects of the study were adolescent and those made on twenty-seven of the subjects thirteen years later . This is a highly creditable measure of prediction . But the correlation of only .34 between the rankings of Jensen and Symonds from the 1953 data indicates the difficulty in making valid judgments about mental hygiene . There are difficulties in assessing the significance of surface indications of success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurotic signs to mental health . There is evidence that evaluations of mental health are influenced by the likes , dislikes , and personal preferences of the judges . One gets somewhat different estimates of adjustment from the projective techniques than from the direct estimates of personality . Direct observation puts emphasis on external evidences of success in work and love life , whereas projective techniques provide evidence on underyling trends , impulses , conflicts , and anxieties . 10 . The Significance of Fantasy Since the Picture-Story Test was used in both the original study of Adolescent Fantasy and in this follow-up study on twenty-eight of the same subjects thirteen years later , it is possible to come to some conclusions concerning the role of fantasy in personality . The first thing that our inquiry revealed was the remarkable similarity in fantasy over the thirteen-year interval between the two studies . In instance after instance it was found that subjects told stories with identical themes to the same pictures . Instances were also found where practically identical stories were told to different pictures by the same subject over the thirteen-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of stories of a subject told thirteen years apart even when they were interspersed with the stories of other subjects . This matching was based both on the formal characteristics of the stories and the thematic content . Fantasy , then , is a somewhat stable aspect of personality . Although evidence has been presented by many investigators to show that fantasy can be influenced by temporary states of hunger , fear , or ambition , and by stimuli impinging on a person from without , these are somewhat superficial aspects of fantasy . Beneath these temporary fluctuations lies a substratum of modes of fantasy expression and thematic content that persist year after year . However tenuous and shadowy fantasy may appear to be superficially , it is something that is a sturdy , substantial , firmly established part of the personality . And one might assume on theoretical grounds that something which is so indubitably a part of personality is no mere epiphenomenon , but plays an important role in the development and in the expression of personality . But in spite of these tendencies toward the stability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted both in the group as a whole and in individuals . The most striking change was a general increase in depression and a decrease in the happy endings to the stories , signifying that adolescent exuberance has given way to discouragement . This is a reaction to the fact that realities of romance and success have been disappointing and have failed to measure up to the shadowy hopes and expectations of adolescence . On the other hand , many of the distinctive characteristics of adolescent fantasy have been lost . There are fewer themes of violent aggression , punishment for it , and reform . Adult experiences have taken the mystery and magic out of sex . There is less need to fantasy escape since most of these adults to a greater or less degree have established emancipation from parental authority . The trends which were noted in Adolescent Fantasy as one moves from earlier to later adolescence are continued and reinforced in early adulthood . A study was made of the factors that are related to these changes . As the evidence was summarized it seemed possible to assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . If environment does not change fantasies will not change ; and the greater the change in environment the greater the change in fantasy . The fantasies of youths or maidens who remain at home , do not go on to college , find work of a routine nature , and do not marry are likely to continue without change into adult life . But if a boy or girl goes to college , has military experience , finds work that requires resourcefulness , marries and establishes a family , there is likelihood that his fantasies will change and lose their adolescent flavor . Eight general principles ( see Chapter Twelve ) , describe the conditions which seem to govern change or lack of change in fantasy . Fantasy was found to have an impact upon later personality in five areas : dependency , erotic impulses , aggression , self-striving , and anxiety with its defenses . It has been shown that adolescent fantasy is lived out in reality in an almost compulsive fashion . Adolescent yearnings for independence find fruition as the young person leaves the home for college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erotic fantasies find expression in marrying and establishing a family . Aggressive impulses find expression in work or in rebellion against the parents or in other ways . Fantasies of self-confidence frequently result in successful , competent adults , whereas fantasies of incompetence are // often reflected in individuals whose doubts about themselves lead to lack of ambition and failure to move ahead vocationally . But sometimes these fantasies never move out of the realm of fantasy . In some cases the struggle for independence is still a struggle in later years and possibly has been channeled into daydreams of independence not yet realized . Perhaps the erotic fantasies have become intensified as hopes for marriage recede . Fantasies of success may become unrealistic wishful thinking as success in reality becomes unattainable . Fantasy may have many vicissitudes . If direct , open expression of the fantasy in realistic living is denied either by circumstances or more generally by interfering , contradictory impulses within the individual , the impulse may find expression in devious other ways . Various mechanisms of displacement , projection , and the like may permit an oblique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then defenses appear in fantasy and defense mechanisms translate these repressed impulses into behavior in disguised form . The evidence points strongly to the conclusion that fantasy attitudes expressed in adolescence play a major role in determining decisions to be made in later life . If erotic impulses are strong and are not contradicted , almost inevitably the result is marriage . But if there is at the same time fear of sex , then at times of decision the individual makes a choice that may lead away from marriage . Aggressive fantasy may lead to an aggressive personality if there are no interfering factors , but in general aggression has been so thoroughly punished and suppressed in our culture that at best it can only find sublimated or displaced expression . Frequently , attitudes that in adolescent fantasy are directed toward parents may in later years be directed toward a spouse or toward one 's children . There is a tendency for anxiety expressed in adolescent fantasy still to be present in adult years . Mechanisms of defense against anxiety expressed in fantasy in adolescence may help to determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends that become sharpened in adult years may have been presaged in adolescent fantasy . In regard to the correspondence between overt adolescent and adult personality , it was found that later personality reflected with great fidelity the personality characteristics of the adolescent years . This was true with regard to physical characteristics , general personality The Significance of Fantasy lyl characteristics , and nervous signs . The mode of response in the interview situation tended to be the same at the two periods . There was a repetition of interests , hobbies , and attitudes . But when it comes to social relationships , it was not possible to predict adult adjustments in personal relationships from adolescent attitudes . Adolescence is a time when interpersonal relationships arouse so much anxiety that frequently the trends are repressed . In particular with young adolescent boys , there is an absence of interest in the opposite sex that by no means predicts the interests and relationships in later years . Boys and girls frequently can not express in words their resentment and hostility toward parents and siblings which they are able in later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are present between adolescent and adult attitudes toward other persons , but these correspondences are irregular , and are not ioo percent perfect . Finally , one would judge that the correspondence between verbally expressed ambitions and intentions with regard to education and vocation is little better than what results from chance . Apparently what a person does has considerable predictive significance , but what he says has little predictive meaning . In spite of the apparent fragile and intangible nature of fantasy the evidence from this study and from psychodynamic theory leads to the conclusion that fantasy is an expression of the basic stuff from which personality is made . The author has referred to fantasy as the " unfinished business " of personality . That is , when one constructs a story with a picture as its stimulus , he weaves the story about his own active impulses and tensions which represent unsolved problems or which indicate the presence of unresolved conflicts . According to theory , if a person finds a satisfactory solution to a problem situation , the impulses and tensions that have been aroused are dissipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning is called upon and lie reacts to it successfully . But if the solution has not been found in previous trials , then old impulses , tensions , and conflicts are aroused again . This has been called the Zeigarnik effect because of the experimental demonstration by Lewin and Zeigarnik that incompleted tasks are remembered better than completed tasks.l ' Kurt Lewin and Bluma Zeigarnik , " Untersuchungen zur Handlungs and Atlektpsychologie , III ; Das Behaltenerledigter and unerledigter Handlungen , " I'sycl. ' ologische Forscbung , IX ( 1927 ) , 1-85. 11 . Growing out of Adolescence into Adulthood As the data in these studies are reviewed , the concept of adolescence as a seperate period in life with distinctive characteristics recedes , and in its place one is impressed with the idiosyncratic nature of the individual personality . It has become customary today to think of the adolescent boy or girl as being a creature with strange and incomprehensible characteristics , difficult to understand and hard to manage . The instability of the adolescent has been often noted . The following quotation from Anna Freud represents fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessively egoistic , regarding themselves as the centre of the universe and the sole object of interest , and yet at no time in later life are they capable of so much self-sacrifice and devotion . They form the most passionate love-relations , only to break them off as abruptly as they began them . On the one hand they throw themselves enthusiastically into the life f the community and , on the other , they have an overpowering longing for solitude . They oscillate between blind submission to some self-chosen leader and defiant rebellion against any and every authority . They are selfish and materially-minded and at the same time full of lofty idealism . They are ascetic but will suddenly plunge into instinctual indulgence of the most primitive character . At times their behavior to other people is rough and inconsiderate , yet they themselves are extremely touchy . Their moods veer between light-hearted optimism and blackest pessimism . Sometimes they will work with indefatigable enthusiasm , and at other times they are sluggish and apathetic . ' This apparently is a composite picture . We found no individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these characteristics , but all these characteristics were found in different individuals . Wallace ( I ) ' Anna Freud , The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense ( London , Hogarth Press , " The International Psychoanalytical Library , " No. 30 , 1937 ) , pp. 149-50. // was cocky , self-assertive , and self-confident ; Olive ( 27 ) was depressed and restrained . Barbara ( 20 ) was self-confident as an adolescent , but Ralph ( z ) was unsure of himself . Julia ( z 5 ) was mature and outgoing sexually , but Celia ( 28 ) tended to be prudish . Isabel ( i8 ) tended to be somewhat secretive , but Jimmy ( 37 ) talked about himself with great gusto . To be sure , Nancy ( 31 ) alternated between periods of hyperexcitability and depression , but it is recognized that she has a special " cyclic " disposition , and there are others who seem to be highly stable . It is unfair and misleading , therefore , to speak of " the adolescent personality . " Characterizing an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variations in the personalities of adolescents and the factors that are responsible for these differences . It is much more helpful to think of personality as a form of adjustment that has been acquired from responding to the vicissitudes of living . So the personality of the adolescent is an outgrowth of experiences of infancy and childhood , and it is not so much a matter of growing out of adolescence as it is reacting to life 's experiences with the personality equipment and reaction tendencies with which the earlier years have equipped one . It is possible , of course , that the conditions of the 1940 study did not make it possible to observe the chameleon-like changes that Anna Freud describes . One would have to live with an adolescent day in and day out to be able to observe the shifts in mood that she describes . But in the 1940 study each individual was seen five or six times over as many weeks , and any marked shifts in mood should have been observed in these several contacts . Jack ( 4 ) was one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the subjects impressed the workers by the consistency of their personalities . One of the outstanding findings of this study is the remarkable persistence of personality trends over the thirteen-year period . Growing out of adolescence does not mean giving up certain personality trends and taking on others , but rather meeting life 's experiences with the same personality equipment one has been provided from earlier years . Wallace ( 1 ) is as aggressive and cocksure as a man as he was when an adolescent . Karl ( 11 ) is just as peculiar as a man and in the same way that he was as an adolescent . Laura ( 13 ) is just as overly polite as a woman as she was as a girl . Barbara ( zo ) , who was described as quicktempered as an adolescent , described herself in the same terms in 1953. // that he would like to be more independent , but he is hopelessly dependent on his parental home , where he still lives . Viola 's ( 14 ) experiences have been related in detail in Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always lived at home . Stella 's ( 19 ) nervousness has been described in Chapter Five . " She said she might as well have lived at home , she was at her mother 's home so frequently . " Barbara ( 20 ) and Celia ( 28 ) , both unmarried , live with their parents . Dorothy ( 30 ) , as has been stated above , although married , still lives in her mother 's home . Jimmy ( 37 ) , in spite of three years of strenuous military service in the infantry , never broke his close dependence on his mother and returned home to live for three years after the war . It is obvious from this that emancipation from family ties has been only partially accomplished by a substantial number of the subjects of the study . Until the follow-up study was made , the full extent of feelings in adolescence was not realized . But adolescence is a time when feelings expand and run strong and deep , and adolescents rarely display their feelings openly . As I pass the adolescents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am impressed by their reticence , reserve , and withdrawal . When a group of adolescents are together there may be a release of feelings expressed in orgies , riots , or " panty raids . " But adolescent fantasy touches upon the strength of underlying feeling . We have learned how strong are the adolescent aggressive feelings expressed in hostility and death wishes toward parents and siblings , also how strong are the feelings for closeness , belonging , and romance . But these feelings are frightening , and the adolescent must do something to mitigate their strength by telling deadpan stories with endings that erase all the violence that preceded , or in real life by holding himself stiffly in control . In later adult years there is also repression . The stories told by young adults have lost the adolescent flavor of adventure , excitement , and mystery . The aggressive themes present in the adolescent stories have virtually disappeared in stories told by adults . Adult fantasy is more matter-of-fact and stimulus-bound . At the same time , however , there is greater freedom to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed some of the retience and reserve of the adolescent period . The young adults in this study were able to meet the interviewer , on the whole , easily and forthrightly , even if this openGrowing // ness was to some extent false and forced and a cover to other emotions and attitudes underneath . We are shown clearly how becoming an adult is a disillusioning experience . In adolescence , fantasy lacks the checks of reality testing . The future is wide open and holds untold possibilities . It is easy to fantasy climbing to a high position in the firm in which one works , of marrying the boss 's daughter , of finding jewels hidden behind the portrait in the livingroom , of robbing a bank . Success is attained ? perhaps with difficulty and only by overcoming hardships ? yet it is attained , in the fantasies of adolescents . But life itself scatters these rewards only in the newspaper headlines . All the young adults in this study were struggling to find themselves vocationally , and if some reached a degree of success it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leisure had not been achieved . Mabel ( 22 ) , with two television sets and a full-time maid , is the exception . Marriage has not provided all that adolescent romantic fantasies have conjured . Edith ( 17 ) , who had fantasies of a theatrical career , found that the theater lost its glamour when she tried it out . Nancy ( 31 ) expressed the man 's point of view : " Tom was listless and dejected . It seemed to him that life had been very cruel indeed . He sat in his room by the window not caring to do much . He had tried so hard and he had failed so bitterly that it seemed to him that he just did n't care what happened . " And Natalie ( 21 ) expressed the woman 's point of view : " This girl is walking home from work . She is tired and discouraged with life in this dirty little town , very drab , and it 's the same old thing every day . You just go to work and come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same thing over again . " On the other hand , the things feared in adolescence are less fearsome after they have been experienced . Life 's experiences provide a kind of reality testing , as illustrated by both Laura ( 13 ) and Roy ( 6 ) , who , as adolescents , told stories marked with mystery , strangeness , and spookiness which was not present in their 1953 stories . This has been interpreted as meaning that the experiences of marriage have taken some of the mystery and fearsomeness out of sex . Likewise , Seymour ( 36 ) told stories in adolescence in which the subject became the victim of circumstances and was aggressed against . " He was struck over the head with a police club . . . he made enough to go home and his mother was very glad t : ) see him , and he said he 'd never run away // again . " Although the same fantasies are present in 1953 , they are less pronounced , and the realities of life have made him less apprehensive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's experiences have helped a person to accept himself more realistically . Edith ( 17 ) told stories with an unusual masculine identification when adolescent , as though she were unable to have the world accept her as a girl , rapidly becoming a woman . It was easier for her at that time to perceive things from the point of view of her father ? a man . As an adult thirteen years later , she is able to relate stories expressed from a woman 's point of view . Adolescent feelings may be so frightening that they are difficult to acknowledge . Edith has had some very maturing experiences ? she has given up her theatrical ambition , has married , has had two children , one of whom died . But there is still enough unrealistic wishing , anxiety , and depression present in the adult stories to indicate that many if not most of the subjects have drawn a curtain enabling them to avoid facing directly the unpleasant aspects of themselves and their circumstances . The increase in depression from adolescence to early adulthood , mentioned many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings of the study . This is a natural result of the disillusionment of adolescent fantasy and expectation . It probably also points to the mystery of what has become of adolescent hostility and aggression . If young adults have lost the aggressive content of their fantasies , some of it may have been directed into work , but some of it , otherwise unexpended , may have been turned inward to appear in the form of regret , discouragement , and surrender . It is a typical human attitude to wish to avoid assuming responsibility for what happens to one and to ascribe it to fate , circumstances , and the machinations of others . The schoolboy does not think of the marks on his report card as something that he earned , but something his teacher has given to him . So it is customary to think of life as being like a grand lottery with prizes being awarded to each as though from the chance turn of a wheel . But connections between early fantasy and later developments in experience and in personality make it seem that events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of it , a person makes turns and decisions according to imperceptible , slight factors which indicate that the direction chosen will harmonize with his inner wishes and fantasies . A man becomes Growing out of Adolescence into Adulthood 20 ? attracted to a woman by her hair , skin , coloring , size , and shape , if one believes the current love songs , but the chances are that he is also attracted by her assertiveness or passivity , by her willingness to take responsibility , to be submissive , to listen , to answer , and a thousand other subtle personality nuances that mean she is like some other important person in his life , and hence continues to fill an old need , or is unlike someone whom he has resisted in the past . Similar considerations determine choice of vocation , employer , school or college , hobby , and indeed , every direction of a person 's activity . Growing out of adolescence therefore means the unconscious exercise of choice that helps a person to find individuals and experiences which permit him to elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unpleasant experiences . One has to select his experiences from those presented to him by circumstances , but life offers a wide selection from which to choose . Two other points should be added here . One is that expressing wild and aggressive fantasies in adolescence by no means precludes good later adjustment . Having aggressive fantasies , death wishes , and Oedipal fantasies is entirely normal ; it does not mean that the adolescent expressing such fantasies is delinquent or mentally disturbed . In fact , those fantasies may be a prelude to excellent adult adjustment in that the adolescent telling them possesses normal vigor and energy which may be put to effective use later on as an adult in work , if a man , or as a mother , if a woman . Illustrations have been given earlier where the hostile , aggressive fantasies of an adolescent have been turned into altruistic , moral characteristics of the adult through the mechanism of reparation . All depends on the channels into which the aggressive fantasies are directed . With the right kind of encouragement and support from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these aggressive fantasies presage highly satisfactory adjustment in adulthood . Finally , a person may make good adjustments in one area and at the same time poor adjustments in another . Mabel ( 22 ) has achieved her ambition of comfortable living , but apparently there is tension in the marriage relationship . Jerome ( 7 ) claims that he could not have a better wife , but vocationally he is quite unhappy . Celia ( z8 ) believes that she is as competent in her work as any man , but she has not been able to get married . Viola ( 14 ) is intelligent and dramatically talented and // she has two fine children with another on the way , but she is in continual conflict with her mother . Wallace ( I ) is apparently successful in his work , but is opinionated and prejudiced . It is , indeed , difficult to find an individual that has made an all good or all bad adjustment . It is this variation that gives each person his own unique personality . Becoming an adult requires making an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocation , and marriage . The autobiographies told in adolescence have been reviewed , and they do not show that our subjects as adolescent boys and girls had given much thought to those important future adjustments and decisions . As one reviews the statements of ambitions of these subjects when they were adolescents , he is impressed by the almost complete lack of planning . As adolescents they lived very much in the present . They were concerned with their homes and school , their friends , sports , hobbies , vacations , clothes , and other activities and interests of immediate concern ; when it came to the future , they became vague and dreamy . As a rule the junior high school subjects assumed that they would go on to high school . Beyond that , their thoughts became unclear . One boy spoke of going to college with a good medical school , yet he actually attended only three years of college in a business program . Two of the junior high school girls stated that they did not want to go to college , while one felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two planned to go into nurses ' training , two had in mind going to business school , one had aspirations to attend dramatic school . But one who did not care to attend college did in fact go and has a B.A. in business . One who wanted to go into nurses ' training went to business school ; and neither of the two who wanted to go to business college achieved this ambition . Apparently the statements of educational ambition were stereotypes ? answers that one had to have ready to satisfy nosy interrogators . It was not much better for the high school subjects . To be sure , they had given more definite thought to future education , but their plans often miscarried . Three of the high school boys ? Jimmy ( 37 ) , John ( 39 ) , and Albert ( 40 ) spoke of going to college , and they were able to achieve their ambitions . One can not attribute lack of educational plans to the educational system because both junior and senior high school had excellent counseling programs , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their education . Apparently , choice with // regard to education is made when one is within months of having to make a decision . Economic considerations outweigh the vague aspirations of adolescence . It is unusual that subjects such as Pansy ( 29 ) and Natalie ( 2I ) knew that they wanted to become nurses , and that the three boys mentioned above knew they wanted to go to college and achieved this ambition by overcoming obstacles . Of the eight who received college degrees , two ? Viola ( 14 ) and Jimmy ( 37 ) ? went to college directly after high school because it was what they most wanted . Viola stood second highest in her high school class . Three ? Roger ( 8 ) , Sam ( 9 ) , and Albert ( 4o ) ? entered college after they had finished their war service , apparently stimulated to further their education by their army experiences . Two ? Ralph ( z ) and John ( 39 ) ? went to college part time at first in order to advance themselves in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during junior high school that she would not go to college , but it was her father 's wish that she go , and she entered at the same time that her younger sister started going . She actually enjoyed it more than high school . The average I.Q. of the eight going to college was 118 , while the average I.Q. of those not going to college was t io , so intelligence was a factor that helped to decide who would go to college . There is some curiosity as to why Edith ( 17 ) , with an I.Q. of 142 , and Celia ( 28 ) , with an I.Q. of 138 , did not go to college . In the case of Edith , her father lost his grocery store in a fire at about the time of her graduation from high school , and the financial loss was a blow to the family . Edith 's mother decided that she should not go to college . Celia graduated fourth in her class , and has since regretted not having gone to college , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitions as she had taken the commercial course . Neither of her parents had gone beyond elementary school , so that higher education was not a tradition in her family . As for vocation , the story is very similar to that of education . Although almost every subject had some vocational goal as an adolescent , it seemed not much more than a matter of chance whether that goal was realized , and one gains the impression that the vocations mentioned in adolescence were either childhood fancies or stereotypes that an adolescent must have ready these days to give to his inquisitors . All of the high school girls were taking the commercial course , and it was natural for them to go into work of a clerical nature . // but they did not make out , " " went with another fellow in the service , but he lost interest in her , " " had a few boy friends in high school . " Two married two years after graduation from high school , one three years , three four years , three five years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school . The girls in this study were forced to wait in many instances for their future husbands to finish their terms of military service and/or to finish college . Julia ( 25 ) , who was engaged while in high school to the man whom she eventually married , waited until six years after graduating from high school while her husband served three years in the Navy and then finished his college career . One gathers the impression that young people today are more impatient than the subjects of this study . Nothing was said in the records to indicate that there was any kind of formal preparation for marriage . Courses were not given in either junior or senior high school in homemaking , and nothing was done to orient the subjects of the study towards an understanding of the psychological factors in marriage or in raising a family . Little was said about receiving sex instruction . Marriage counseling was not mentioned . Apparently the community was willing to assume that all the intricacies of marriage and establishing a home come quite naturally and do not require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slayson ? that " One of the major errors of our culture is the assumption that everyone who can bear children can ipso facto also rear them ... . If parenthood is to be considered a skill and not entirely a series of instinctive responses as it is in other animals , then obviously training for it is essential " 2 ? has not only not been accepted but not even considered by the community in which this study was conducted . The general impression gained from reviewing the experiences of these twenty-eight individuals as they progressed from adolescence to young adulthood is that their maturing was on the whole a blind , trial-and-error process . Little or nothing has been done to help them to anticipate and plan the next steps . Every problem had to be met and dealt with whatever resources the individual had available when he came face-to-face with it . Formal education gave almost no help in preparing a person to meet the problems of education , vocation , and marriage that he must inevitably face . A century ago , when a trade ' S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , International Universities Press , 1958 ) , pp. 308 , 297 ? // was learned through apprenticeship and when the arts and skills of homemaking were learned in the parental home , such skills were passed along from one generation to another without difficulty . Now , with the complexity of modern living and the lessening cohesion of family life , these older institutions can no longer be depended upon to provide necessary instruction . There is need today to plan for the induction of adolescents into the skills of adult living through formal education . // the pattern of defense adopted in later years . Psychosomatic or psychotic trends that appear in adult years may be foreshadowed in adolescent fantasy . It is hypothesized that change in fantasy is a function of change in environment ; if the situation does not change , in general , the fantasies do not change . Changes in fantasy have been related to changes in experience and these are summarized in eight principles . 1 . If a tendency is expressed in reality there is less need to fantasy it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less need to romanticize , glorify , or symbolize it in fantasy . 3 . If a tendency is expressed in reality the opposite active trend may appear in fantasy , or the opposite passive trend may disappear from fantasy . 4 . Life 's experiences sometimes remove a person from a punishing , forbidding figure , which permits him to break through repression , and as a result of these experiences he can better verbalize hostility or love in fantasy . 5 . Fantasies are frequently in keeping with life 's experiences , posing problems that have not been wholly and successfully worked through . 6 . Some individuals with increasing age face new problems or old problems with increasing intensity , and these problems may find expression in fantasy . 7 . Fantasies reflect the rise or fall of the level of anxiety and guilt according to the success with which a person has found adequate defenses against these affects . 8 . Fantasies sometimes shift as there is need for a shift in the defenses against anxiety and guilt . There is a high degree of consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) physical characteristics ; ( b ) general personality characteristics , including aggressiveness , in response to the interview situation and to the tests ; ( c ) nervous signs ; ( d ) hobbies ; and ( e ) attitudes . With regard to interpersonal relationships , it is not possible to predict adult attitudes from adolescent attitudes . No firm predictive relationship was found between verbally expressed educational or vocational plans or intentions in adolescence and actual educational or vocational experiences in later years . // ' With regard to the Rorschach , several conclusions were reached . A comparison of the Rorschach signs with normative data indicate that these subjects do not differ significantly from people in general . However , a lower FC and a higher CF indicate that the subjects in this study are somewhat less emotionally inhibited than the adults in other normative studies . This conclusion does not agree with the detailed Rorschach interpretations , conclusions from which are given below . From the Rorschach , twenty of the subjects were diagnosed as normal although this group shows some neurotic symptoms including depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immature , excitable , ineffective , rigid , oppositional , or detached . Six are schizoid and one is classified as paranoid schizophrenic . Every one of the twentyseven subjects for whom the Rorschach is available showed some sign of sexual disturbance or failure to achieve maximum or even optimum sexual functioning , as indicated by such descriptive terms as immature , inadequate , unresponsive , and unable to accept his or her sexual role . Two of the men and four of the women in the study were said to have little identity as a person , with feelings of inadequacy and inferiority . Feminine identification was recognized in eight of the men in the study and masculine identification in three of the women ; three other women were unsure of their sexual identity . The subjects of the study are not what would be called aggressive individuals and most of them show a high degree of emotional control , but there is a strong undercurrent of aggression in most of the subjects . The Rorschach indicates a general inability to maintain a warm , comfortable rapport with others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling and sensitivity , and no real empathy for an understanding of others . Subjects in the study have difficulty in managing their feelings , either repressing them on the one hand , or expressing them in violent and uncontrolled bursts of passion or rage on the other . Credit is given from the Rorschach for commendable mental functioning , with good judgment , organizational ability , and reality contact . A large number of subjects in the study are suffering from feelings of personal inadequacy and possess low self-esteem . Repression and projection are common defenses against anxiety . Eleven subjects are characterized as assertive , over-reactive , and even explosive ; while ten are credited as having low drive and energy . Depression is mentioned as present in the Rorschachs of fourteen of the subjects . // in a man-woman sexual situation . She is not able to stand much pressure , and feels paranoid and persecuted if pressure is applied . Viola ( 14 ) , too , had much to say about resisting her mother with regard to marriage . She has been quite willing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband for short periods , but she always returned to him . They have two children , and she spoke of her " togetherness " with her husband . But the Rorschach tells of fear of sexual contact , and the unconscious fear of the phallus as a dangerous and destructive weapon . Edith ( 1 ' ) talked about her husband with high praise and admiration . She described him as a quiet fellow , not at all aggressive . But the Rorschach indicates little evidence of sensuality . According to the Rorschach she is afraid of men and sex , and is sexually unresponsive ( frigid ) , but is probably a compliant , dutiful wife . Stella ( 19 ) seems to be very happy in her marriage . She claims that she likes housework . She thinks married life is much better than single life largely because she has such a good husband . But the Rorschach indicates that she is unable to deal with her sexuality with any deep or strong feelings . Her deeper identification tends to be masculine ? or she is afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels superior to her husband but also feels quite happy in her marriage . She claims her husband is a jealous man and one who can not tolerate anything that is feminine or sissy . There was evidence of much difference between them about raising the children . At the end of the interview she commented , " I hope I have n't given you the impression that our marriage is not happy . " The Rorschach indicates that she feels inadequate as a woman , that she feels damaged and hurt as a female and suffers from a castration complex , and consequently has a great need to be looked at and admired . Dorothy . ( 30 ) complained that her husband is impotent , never becomes aroused sexually , and never makes sexual advances . He is kind to her and they get along perfectly in every other way . But the Rorschach pictures her as sexually frigid and unresponsive . She is preoccupied with sex and finds it difficult to accept her role as woman and wife , although she adopts a pseudo-housewifely role . Sexual intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good illustration of the frequent tendency to project one 's sexual difficulties and to place the blame and responsibility on one 's partner . // Nancy ( 31 ) refers to her husband as disgustingly realistic , especially about money . She complained about feeling restricted since her marriage and stated if she could do it over again she would wait longer before marrying so that she could have more time to run around and have fun . The Rorschach also indicates dissatisfaction with her marriage , but attributes this to feelings of insecurity and failure as a woman and as a sexual partner . Edwin 's ( 33 ) wife is a cripple . He states that he does not have many interests in common with her , but they rarely argue about anything . They have one child and would like another . The Rorschach indicates a deep feminine identification on his part , and feelings of inadequacy as a man make him timid with women . He equates sex with annihilation , inasmuch as his feminine identification places him in the role of victim , not the aggressor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has married twice . His first marriage was not based on any real attachment , and actually he lived with his first wife only about a week because of the war . He says he would n't be a bachelor for anything now . He lets his wife make most of the decisions , and she has her way with most things . He claims that he has a very good sex life . But the Rorschach interpretation mentions lack of sexual identity . He is uncertain of his masculinity and hence overcompensates by overidealizing the masculine role , but he has very little capacity to invest libido in his relationships . Jimmy ( 37 ) was so effusive in his interview that it was difficult to pin him down on any topic . He has evidently had a variety of experiences with women , but is now married and says the marriage has been happy from the start , with no difficulty in sexual adjustment . The Rorschach , however , pictures him as inadequate as a man and ambivalent toward women . He has difficulty in combining tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties were never adequately resolved , and he alternates between passive feminine identification and aggressive masculine assertion . It is difficult for him to find normal libidinal pleasure , and the sexual act becomes overspiritualized and overidealized . The Rorschach indicates his tendency to deny disappointment and frustration in sexual contacts . This brief comparison of the picture obtained from the interview and the Rorschach is sufficient to indicate how the interview fails to show the deeper underlying sexual attitudes . There is a tendency in // the interview to disguise real sexual attitudes by projection and denial . Psychosexual adjustment is not openly displayed in the stories from the Picture-Story Test . When one reviews the whole series of stories he finds plenty of direct reference to heterosexual relationships . Rare are the direct references to sex behavior as such , although this may be found in subjects 37 and 39 . More common are the social adjustments and attitudes that are sexual in nature , as indicated by romance and marriage . There is undoubtedly much reference to sex that is symbolic , as was mentioned in Adolescent Fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in themes of kidnaping , of being followed , hiding and being caught , passing an examination , automobile driving , collisions and crashes , robbery , particularly of jewels , and getting a job . Sexual attitudes are shown by aggressive activity or by timid and retiring passivity . Attitudes and relationships toward parents or parent figures frequently carry information as to sexual attitudes . Much general repression implies sexual repression , and general fear implies sexual fear . On a superficial level , references to sex or to heterosexual relationships in the stories usually agree with and frequently amplify attitudes and behavior that were expressed in the interviews . Frequently the stories contain rather fantastic wishes that apparently play only a minor role in the individual 's present and overt personality . Isabel ( 18 ) incorporates the same romantic interests of love and marriage in one of her stories ( A-1o ) that she expresses in her interview , but the interest is faraway and remote . Barbara ( 20 ) , unmarried and with strong masculine identification , places much more of her sexual longings into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marriage ( A-1 , B-3 ) , fear of marriage ( B-3 ) , a broken engagement ( A-9 ) , and rejection of marriage ( A-3 ) . These are the same themes that she expresses in the interviews , but she expresses them with greater conviction and abandon in her stories . There is also confusion over sex role ( B-3 ) , with an emphasis on the weakness of men and the strength of women ( B-1o ) . The stories also present the conflict between marriage and a career ( A-5 ) , desire to be on one 's own ( A-9 ) , work as an escape ( B-9 ) , and the loneliness of being single ( A-3 ) . Celia ( 28 ) , also unmarried , tells a story ( A-1o ) with themes of marriage , children , and security . But in story A-2 a girl 's parents will not approve of a man because he does not have a good job . This is a patent projec136 Analysis of the Rorschach tion in her stories . Apparently Celia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men revealed in the Rorschach . John ( 39 ) reveals his attitude toward women much more forcefully in his stories than in his interviews . The stories show strong hostility toward women , picturing them as fickle and untrustworthy , and he has a very poor view of marriage . In one story ( B-7 ) a man can not satisfy a woman sexually and she leaves him , but in other stories a man abandons a woman ( A-5 , B-ro ) . In story B-9 sex and violence are confused with each other . On the basis of the Picture-Story Test Dr. Jensen tentatively diagnosed latent homosexuality . " There is a blatant rejection of heterosexuality . There is reason to suspect fears of sexual inadequacy . He seems to be a castrated male . Women are threatening to him and hence he fears them . " The Rorschach mentions feminine identification , but stresses the aggressive elements in his personality and the sadomasochistic elements which cause an alternation between passivity and aggressive self-assertion . The sexual implications in the fantasy productions of a few other cases will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies in her stories that deal with relations between the sexes . There is guilt over sexual transgression ( B-io ) and a need for punishment . But there is mutual dependency of husband and wife , and the wife can change , reform , or rescue a man . There is denial of conflict in marriage ( A-6 ) and the picture of an ideally happy family which is also mentioned in the interview . Neither the Picture-Story Test nor the interview indicate the sexual fear that is shown in the Rorschach . Apparently her moral attitude toward sex , present in conscious fantasy , is a defense against fear of sexual contact and the male organ . Olive ( 27 ) fantasies a woman who feels neglected when taken for granted , and wants to be important to a man ( B-io ) . In another story a husband is unfaithful ( B-5 ) , while in another it is the woman who wants to go out and have a good time , but the husband is timid and stays at home to do some of the housework ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is nothing in the interview to suggest this . She stated that her husband was her first and only boy friend . They have interests in common . She is very much against petting outside of marriage . Although the Rorschach report mentions a repression of basic sexual energy , it emphasizes that sexual // expression turns toward display and exhibitionism with little capacity to be sexually feminine , soft , or yielding . Discrepancy between the Rorschach and other evidence in the case of Olive has been discussed at the beginning of this chapter . The main emphasis in the stories of Dorothy ( 30 ) is passivity . There is desire for marriage ( A-1o ) , men are watching her ( B- o ) , the girl waits for a boy but the boy is shy and embarrassed ( A-3 ) . Dorothy pictures her husband in the interview as impotent , whereas the Rorschach report sees her as frigid and unresponsive . The Picture-Story Test in this case indicates her underlying wish life , the interview projects the difficulty onto the husband , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive trend , the Picture-Story Test the wish life , while both of these are hidden by the defenses present in the interview . Nancy ( 31 ) emphasizes in her stories how important it is to have support from a husband ( A-3 , A-9 ) , and that a boy and girl should always be together ( A-1o ) , but there are themes of marital difficulties ( A-6 ) and unfaithfulness ( A-5 ) , and of lovers separated ( B-3 ) . There is also an indication of sex guilt . This is quite contradictory to the interview , which indicates that if anything her marriage is too strongly cemented to suit her . She craves more freedom . She also states that whereas her husband is suspicious of people she is very trusting of others . Here is an unresolved discrepancy , but one suspects that there are unconscious fantasies of a promiscuous nature that are revealed in the fantasy productions . The fantasies of Jimmy ( 37 ) are difficult to interpret , partly because his stories are long and involved . Sex is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In two stories a younger person ( a man in A-7 , a girl in B-8 ) marries an older person . There is conflict between sex and certain more spiritual aspects of relationships between the sexes . A woman is horrified at the grossness of men in sexual relations ( A-8 ) . Jimmy 's stories indicate clearly the unresolved Oedipus situation . In his interviews Jimmy , as has been recounted , discusses at length his struggle to achieve independence from his mother , intimates that he has had many sexual experiences , but that he is now happily married . The Rorschach pictures his ambivalence toward women , but also his inadequacy as a man . It is difficult to summarize the contribution of these three kinds of // evidence with regard to sex . Undoubtedly the Rorschach contains evidence as to basic sexual attitudes and feelings . The Picture-Story Test reveals the attitudes that can be expressed verbally in fantasy . These frequently pertain to the wish life , and may or may not agree with the underlying tendencies shown by the Rorschach . The interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the individual himself is willing to admit to consciousness , and frequently , if not usually , they represent defenses against deeper , unacceptable feelings and attitudes . It is common for a person to deny difficulties , to claim that sexual adjustment is satisfactory , or to project his difficulties onto his partner . SUMMARY : IDENTITY figure identity 3 Analysis of the Rorschach 139 Identity Although sex-role identification has been discussed in part in the section dealing with psychosexual adjustment , it will be given fuller treatment in this section dealing with identity . Identification is considered either in general terms as meaning personal identity or as sexrole identification . By personal identity is meant having a clear concept of self as a person , not being very dependent on others , possessing independence in thought and action . In the case of one subject it was said that " he has little feeling of himself as a person ? he does not know who he is or what he wants , " and for another that " he does not know where the world ends and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a masculine or femine role should be clear . The Rorschach indicated that two of the men and four of the women in the study have little identity as persons . These individuals also have feelings of inadequacy and inferiority and usually are weak , dependent , demanding individuals . With regard to sex-role identification in general , if a man had made a masculine identification this was not commented on in the Rorschach report . Masculine identification among the men was mentioned only when it served as a defense against weakness or feminine tendencies , as was clearly the case for John ( 39 ) and less clearly for Sam ( 9 ) . Feminine identification was mentioned for five of the women , but for two of these , Natalie ( 2 i ) and Dorothy ( 30 ) , this is called pseudofemininity , and for these two individuals this , too , served as a defense against underlying doubts about rejection of the feminine position . Feminine identification was recognized in the case of eight of the men under such headings as feminine identification , feminine-passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For five of the men ( including some already mentioned ) there was confused sex-role identification , as an alternation between the masculine and feminine and concern for adequacy as a man . In cases of the women , masculine identification was mentioned for three , penis envy for two , while three were said to be unsure of and confused about their sexual identity . The matter of maturity of sexual identity was mentioned for eight women . As is the case with most of the other areas in which tabulations of 14o Analysis of the Rorschach the Rorschach interpretations have been made , there are overlappings and inconsistencies . For instance , Barbara ( 20 ) is said to have both feminine and masculine identification as well as inability to accept herself as a mature woman . Here as in other cases subtle distinctions are made in the Rorschach report . In the case of Barbara the identification is said to be mainly feminine , although she is not sure of her femininity . But there is also a secret penis envy and wish to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a feminine one . She feels she has little to give as a woman . The report concludes , " She is capable of much richer and more rewarding emotional life if she could accept her feminity and sexuality more . " Although not specifically stated there seems to be an assumption that sex-role identification is in some way related to the adequacy of psychosexual adjustment . When the masculine role for men and the feminine role for women is adopted , without question heterosexual relationships tend to be normal , adequate , and satisfactory . But if the reverse identification is the case , a man lacks some of the assertion and aggressiveness for adequate sexual functioning and the woman lacks the gentle , yielding , compliant , submissive response necessary for her role in heterosexual relationships . But these same attributes also characterize to some degree nonsexual relationships . The man who lacks unconflicted masculine identification tends to be somewhat unassertive and lacking in aggression in his social and work relationships , or vice versa ? the woman with masculine identification tends to be aggressive and bossy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the lines in order to get any hint as to sex identification from the interview reports . Among the men feminine traits may be expressed by the following . Ralph ( 2 ) " wore a fresh starched white shirt , a necktie , and a very clean white woolen sweater . He wore a heavy jeweled ring on the fourth finger of his left hand . " Jerome 's ( 7 ) " hair is extremely well brushed and combed . He gave the interviewer the impression that he is conscious of his theatrically handsome appearance . " John ( 39 ) , who tries to impress the world as a " he-man , " does not drink or smoke . He once ran off five hundred copies of the Alcoholics Anonymous code on a ditto machine and passed them out to everyone he knew who drank . Albert ( 40 ) does n't like selling because he feels that he is not aggressive enough to be a good salesman . // On the other hand , of the women with masculine identification Barbara ( 20 ) was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat up all the neighborhood boys . One of the male subjects in the study still carries a scar over his eye that he received from Barbara as a boy . Even today she wants men to know she is as good as they are . Celia ( 28 ) " often resents the fact that she has been doing a man 's job but does not get equal recognition with the men in the company where she works . She believes that she is better qualified than some men who are promoted beyond her station in the firm . " These illustrations were selected to show the correspondence between the Rorschach and the impression on the interviewer . In most of the interview reports such correspondence is not nearly as obvious , and one must conclude that in general sex-role identification as interpreted from the Rorschach does not have an obvious correspondence with the overt personality . The Picture-Story Test , on the other hand , counts sex-role identification as one of its principal features . Every story is told from the point of view of either a male or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero in the story is chosen from one of the minor characters in the picture or someone not present in the picture at all , the sex-role identification is especially prominent . Feminine identification was specially noted in the stories of Roger ( 8 ) . That he identified the figure in A-z as a woman was quite unusual . Dr. Jensen comments , " In outward appearance Roger is probably the most masculine subject in the study . The girls in story A-8 with whom he obviously identifies are both sexually seduced . " These are two girls that were ? that worked at a dime-a-dance dance hall . Probably they have a poor reputation . The dark-haired one possibly has been in the dance hall for a number of years while the blonde has just been introduced to the dance hall routine with in the last few months ? the last three or four months . The brunette has hardened to the task of dancing and going out at nights with just anyone who seems to ask , with the ? who has a large bankroll . The blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked into going out with a twosome that the brunette has selected , found or been introduced to . They 'll go out with the twosome , dance , have a few drinks . They 'll probably end up in one of the girl 's apartments . They 'll make a night out of it and the men will leave the next morning . The blonde being possibly a slight tinge of conscience but as she gets hardened to it after a while there wo n't be any conscience left . ( Roger , subject 8 , Picture-Story A-8 , 1953 ) // There is a possibility that Roger 's anxiety over his ability is related to his concept of himself as a man . Of Roger the Rorschach report says : " His generally aggressive and slightly superior attitude may give the impression of masculinity and self-assurance , but his concept of himself as a man is far from sure and adequate . " However , the Rorschach makes this more a matter of immaturity than of feminine identification . Women in the stories of Barbara ( 20 ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification . Pansy ( 29 ) expresses some doubt as to sexual identity by being unsure whether the figures in pictures A-2 and B-9 are men or women . According to the Rorschach the identification is basically feminine , although somewhat immature . In some of the stories , concern about sex-role identification among the women may be expressed by doubts about one 's attractiveness . This was particularly noticeable in the stories told by adolescents . Dorothy ( 30 ) fantasies in story B-io that a man is interested in the main female character , which may be merely a wish-fulfilling fantasy , but also possibly a fantasy on reassurance that she is sexually attractive . The Rorschach refers to her pseudofemininity and the fact that she is not sure of her femininity . Edwin ( 33 ) shows a tendency toward feminine identification in his stories . The girl in story B-5 is concerned about her hairdo . Edwin is definitely credited with feminine identification by the Rorschach . John ( 39 ) , who adopts a very masculine persona in life , shows sexrole confusion in his stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if it should be a female or a male . " On card A-io he comments , " I was going to say two girls going down to a swami , but I will set this up as a girl and a guy . " On A-2 he makes the male figure an artist , a somewhat feminine pursuit , " but he could n't get to be an artist , he was just painting walls and ceilings , just trying to make ends meet . " Being an artist is quite different from John 's real job in life as foreman in an automobile plant . According to the Rorschach he has a definite homosexual orientation . In the cases in which sex role stands out in a particularly striking way in the Picture-Story Test there is good agreement with the Rorschach. figure Admitting that aggression is present in everyone , the question remains ? how is it expressed ? The above tabulation is an attempt to summarize the Rorschach interpretations with regard to aggression . Again this attempt to summarize does injustice to the evidence which shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . Three of the men and six of the women are characterized as aggressive ; in three of the men and four of the women aggression is repressed . // The interview of Pansy ( 29 ) depicts a very masochistic , longsuffering woman , and the Picture-Story Test shows strong repression of aggressive tendencies , although father and mother figures are depicted as punitive and critical . But the Rorschach report refers to a " pervasive hostility " and an " attitude of rationalized dislike for and disgust with the world . " One may summarize and generalize this survey of nine individuals depicted by the Rorschach as aggressive by saying that this aggression is by no means reflected in the interviews or Picture-Story Test . Whatever underlying aggressive tendencies there may be are well repressed or are disguised , appearing either in ambitious striving or projected onto parent figures . It is generally true that sweetness , gentleness , and passivity seen in persons may be reaction formations against underlying hostility and aggressive impulses . To take a quick look at the subjects who are described by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is described as overcontrolled ? tense and inhibited in speech and manner ; a man with high blood pressure . The Picture-Story Test reveals fear of a parent 's anger . Sam ( q ) describes himself as very even-tempered , almost too calm , rarely losing his temper but on occasions really " blowing his top . " However , the Picture-Story Test contains more violent aggression than is found in any other adult subject . There are stories indicating the effort to hold his aggressive tendencies under restraint , but with difficulty , and there are conflicts between passive and aggressive impulses . The Rorschach report tells that in certain aggressive situations he becomes blocked and almost completely incapacitated from functioning . Edwin ( 33 ) is characterized as easygoing , calm , the most relaxed person in the study ? " It takes a big strain to make him blow his top . " Aggression is practically absent from the Picture-Story Test , being present in only one story , which expressed a death wish toward a sibling . Among the women with repressed aggression on the Rorschach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interview telling of her mother 's dominating tendencies and how she claimed her independence and rebelled by her marriage and by rejecting religion . She describes her husband 's aunt as a " shrew . " In the Picture-Story Test she reaffirms the attitudes that she expresses in life . There is attribution ( projected ) of hostility toward a mother figure and a death // wish toward a father figure . There is a denial of aggressive intentions in the main figures in a story and the attitude of being the victim of aggression . The Rorschach states that Viola 's main problem centers about the repression of aggressive feelings and that " the repression of aggressive and libidinal energy is a serious weakness in the personality and robs her of self-assertion and self-reliance . " Isabel ( 18 ) reports that she does not like to have to boss other people , and impressed the interviewer as being a quiet , retiring person lacking in vivacity . In fantasy mothers are disapproving and fathers are angry , but the main subject exhibits no aggression . Barbara ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . She has the male identification mentioned in earlier chapters , and claims that she likes a good fight or a good argument once in a while , regardless of what it is about . It is a means of letting off steam . She often gets into fights with fellows just to stir things up . In the Picture-Story Test a woman is described as strong-willed with a temper ( B-io ) , and the man in the story is weaker than the woman . Mother figures ( B-5 ) are castrating , and there are death wishes toward father figures ( A-I , A-1o ) . The Rorschach is interpreted in this case as showing curtailment of aggressive energy , resulting in accumulation of hostility and a feeling of rejection toward people . Finally , Nancy ( 3 I ) says that on occasion she is very short-tempered , but these periods last only a short time . The interviewer noticed that she showed " controlled patience " with her little girl who annoyed them during the interview . There is nothing in the Picture-Story Test that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is cut off from her own anger , but expects other people to be unpleasant and critical . No attempt will be made here to review the other cases in which the Rorschach report mentions specialized forms of the expression of aggressive tendencies . Three of these four cases of repressed aggression on the Rorschach also show restricted , overcontrolled personalities . Barbara is the exception , but the chances are that she is not quite as pugilistic in everyday affairs as she gave the interviewer to believe . He found Barbara to be lively and vivacious , a dynamic person but not overly assertive . One may summarize that on the whole the subjects in this study are not what would be called aggressive individuals , and most of them show 15o Analysis of the Rorschach behavior . Five were suspicious and distrustful , two were oppositional and stubborn . Four tended to be conventional and two were conscious of social status . Three expressed a feeling of being pressured or coerced , while two met the problem of social relations by acting cute . The overall impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have difficulty in their social relationships . While outwardly they may be pleasant and at ease , inwardly they feel considerable discomfort in their social relationships , and lack genuine warmth and feeling . There is distance between them and other people , to which they try to adjust by a variety of social stratagems which make them superficially appear to have good rapport with others . An attempt was made to relate the interpretations of the Rorschach concerning interpersonal relationships with the interviews , but this was difficult to do . Individuals in the interviews seldom came out to discuss their relations with others in an evaluative way . The general impression of the interviewer may touch only the superficial attitudes and fail to penetrate to the underlying feelings . Nonetheless , the impression made on the interviewer may have some significance . Indications of social adjustment from the interviews are provided for the seven individuals whom the Rorschach described as having poor social adjustment . Roy ( 6 ) impressed the interviewer as " on the spot " during the testing and the interview . " He attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was harder to draw out than most of the subjects , and seemed to be rather uncomfortable . Isabel ( i8 ) was tense , nervous , inhibited , and quite selfconscious at times . She gave the impression that her feelings could easily be hurt . Stella ( iv ) , on the other hand , was friendly and spoke easily . Iiut Dr. Jensen described her as nervous and depressed under stress , moody and seldom elated . Olive ( 27 ) has been mentioned several times because of her inability to relate . Dr. Jensen found her repressed , friendly but in a very restrained way , a bit self-conscious and not at all vivacious . She was tense and nervous at first during the interview . Pansy ( 29 ) had a tired , run-down look , and lacked animation . She has always enjoyed being around sick people . She does not care for her neighbors , who are gossipy . Dorothy ( 3o ) was tense , inhibited , and nervous at the beginning of the interviews , although she loosened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy ( 3 ) // tended to depart from this general picture of tenseness , reserve , and feeling ill-at-ease with a stranger . Nancy was friendly and casual , but she became inhibited and stilted in telling the stories . She stated that she can be miserable to live with when she becomes down in the dumps and becomes grumpy . These , of course , are superficial impressions , and the picture is by no means uniform , but the general impression is that these seven individuals are not comfortable in a social relationship . Let us look at two individuals whom the Rorschach described as warm and accepting . Viola ( 14 ) was tense , talkative , fluent , and went into everything in the interview with the same elaborateness that she showed on the Rorschach . She spoke of " togetherness " with her husband . Barbara ( 20 ) , friendly , lively , and outgoing , also is a person of high energy level . Apparently she relates to others without much trouble . In the interview she emphasized her short temper and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she overstressed this side of her personality and did not stress her warm , outgoing relationships . But Barbara is not married . Probably one must not confuse spontaneity in social relationships with good heterosexual adjustment . These two subjects , who showed good social adjustment on the Rorschach , have vivid , lively , outgoing personalities in real life , as contrasted with the restrained , reserved personalities of those whom the Rorschach picked out as having poor social relationships . It is difficult to estimate social adjustment from the fantasy material . Every set of stories depicts people relating to one another , and it is not possible to differentiate one story set as indicating more or less ease in social relations . The clearest differentiating factor is to be found in the formal aspects of the stories . Ratings were made on interpersonal adjustment on the Rorschach and correlated with Dr. Jensen 's ratings on ( I ) being pleasant and friendly in the interview , and ( 2 ) adjusting to others of his or her own age group . These correlations were .00 and +.27 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from poorer socially adjusted subjects could not be isolated . At first glance it appeared that the poorly adjusted subjects showed greater depression , passivity , and dependence than the better adjusted subjects , and the poorly adjusted subjects rather regularly included stories with angry , rejecting , punitive father figures . But these same factors were 1 52 Analysis of the Rorschach also present in the stories of the better adjusted , so no conclusions can be drawn from content in the Picture-Story Test that would relate to . social adjustment as shown by the Rorschach . It was thought that social adjustment rated by the Rorschach might be related to psychosexual adjustment shown from the Rorschach , but no clear-cut relationship could be found . Of the seven individuals who were said to have " good sexual adjustment superficially , " only four were said to have " reasonably good social adjustment . " Of the seven unmarried subjects , six were said to have reasonably good social adjustment superficially from the Rorschach , but five of these show basically poor rapport in their social relations . No definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both as shown by the Rorschach . Four of the six persons who showed friction in social adjustment were also classed as aggressive , and one showed oppositional tendencies . But of the seven who were said to have poor social adjustment three had aggressive personalities , while three showed repressed aggressive or oppositional tendencies . Apparently poor social adjustment may mean poorly directed aggression or the repression of aggression with consequent loss of social contact . figure Comments about affect and emotion on the Rorschach reports range all the way from extremely positive emotional excitability and overintensity to dissociation of affect and repression of feeling . Ten individuals were said to have intense and violent feelings , and eleven showed an explosive type of affect.with extreme irritability , passion , or rage . At the other extreme there were eleven who showed more or less repression of feeling , and fourteen who were described as having shallow affect . Only a relatively few were credited with positive feelings under good control , three with warm feelings , eight with a feminine type of gentle , tender feelings , and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling indication from the record is the difficulty people find in managing their feelings ? they either repress them , or else express them in violent and uncontrolled bursts of passion or rage . The careful reader should not be disturbed by overlappings in the tabulation . One would have to see the Rorschach reports themselves to appreciate the finesse of interpretations . Not infrequently repression of affect is coupled with episodes of explosiveness . Of Isabel ( 18 ) it is said : " On a superficial level she is able to express her positive feelings easily , but she lacks genuine feeling for and sensitivity to people . Her affect is generally superficial but pleasant . " Of Mabel ( 22 ) it is said : " The emotional range appears to be narrow . Outside of anger , there is little capacity for strong emotion ? though her affect is by no means shallow . " Again , as with the social adjustments , it is very difficult to check these interpretations against either the interview or the fantasy stories . But an inspection of Dr. Jensen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rorschach view shows a remarkable correspondence with the Rorschach in regard to the expression of affect , as can be seen from a sample of individuals at either extreme in the Rorschach interpretations . Of those with intense or violent feelings as diagnosed in the Rorschach , Wallace ( c ) , who gave Dr. Jensen a somewhat rough time , was hostile , resentful , and cocksure at the beginning of his interview . He seemed irritated and at times on the verge of losing his temper . In the second interview , however , he became very friendly , mixing a drink and offering to cooperate in the study in any way he could . Roger ( 8 ) was pleasant , cordial , aggressive in a quiet way , and he , too , took Dr. Jensen into his kitchen when he mixed highballs . Viola 's ( 14 ) talk consisted mainly of describing her feelings and subjective states . Celia ( 28 ) had quite lively facial expressions , and laughed and giggled a good deal at various points of the interview . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke dynamically , bursting out into very loud laughter , pounding the table with his fist . He was an assertive , dynamic , vivacious , emphatic person , and a fluent talker . Of those who were diagnosed as having weak , shallow affect , dissociation of affect , and repression of feeling in the Rorschach , Ralph ( 2 ) has been drunk only once in his life , and then had a terrific hangover the next day . He claims he will never drink that much again . He becomes depressed and has gastritis when under stress . Laura ( 13 ) seemed submissive , almost too " nice . " She gave the impression of being a colorless , almost spineless , person . She was not at all assertive and was a person of rather low energy level . Margaret ( 24 ) spoke in a low , quiet voice , and gave the impression of being a stable , solid sort of person , not very " sensitive . " She took longer to tell stories than any other subject in the study . Pansy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her drowsy , listless manner . She looked overworked , tired , run-down and without much energy , and lacked animation . Edwin ( 33 ) spoke in a slow , quiet voice . He was described as easygoing , not at all dynamic , having a sleepy personality . One can see that the estimates of affectivity from the Rorschach correspond closely with estimates of energy level , vivacity , and dynamic quality as these factors impressed the interviewer . In inspecting the fantasy material with respect to affect it has not been possible to differentiate subjects , at least not from story content . Stories of both those who were diagnosed as showing much and little // affect on the Rorschach showed a variety of feelings in the stories . See page 174. figure On the whole the Rorschach report gives individuals credit for having good minds and using them effectively . Fourteen subjects are said to have from good to excellent intelligence and good to excellent thinking , reasoning , and use of logic . Nine subjects were credited with good judgment . Other comments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keenness of perception . In six of the cases it was said that reality contact was good , and five were able to see the world as others do . // Few comments attributed low intelligence to these subjects . Eight were said to have poor judgment . Only scattered comments were made concerning absence of originality , imagination , and insight . Six of the reports mentioned confused and disorganized thinking . In others it was noted that there was intellectual blocking or that intelligence was not well used or was inefficient . Eight of the subjects were thought to have poor contact with reality , while six seemed to have little practical sense . By and large , credit was given for commendable mental functioning , and in only a minority of the cases was it commented that judgment was poor , that inefficient use was being made of intelligence , that there was intellectual disorganization and confusion with poor reality contact . This more optimistic report of mental functioning is to be contrasted with the very negative conclusions about affect , psychosexual and social adjustment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to estimate intelligence or reality contact from the interviews . However , aberrations in thinking were noted in some of the interview reports . Roy ( 6 ) gave short and somewhat stilted responses to questions that were put to him . The mental peculiarities of Karl ( 11 ) have been commented on many times . Although extremely precise about dates , he evaded direct questions by wandering off to another subject unrelated to the question that was asked . But there was nothing in the interview reports of subjects 2 , 19 , 22 , or 33 to indicate confused or disorganized thinking . Subjects 9 , 27 , z8 , 37 , and 40 have I.Q. 's of 121 , 86 , 138 , 112 , and 134 , respectively . The Rorschach report on Olive ( 27 ) is in error in many respects ( pp. 286-87 ) , particularly in crediting her with good thinking and reasoning . But Sam ( q ) , Celia ( 28 ) , and Albert ( 40 ) , whose thinking and reasoning are excellent according to the Rorschach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a particularly verbose individual and impresses one as being bright , but his mental test scores do not put him in a high intelligence bracket . In some instances subjects quite obviously impressed the interviewer with their intelligence even though he did not make a precise note of his impression . He comments about Celia : " Her Rorschach seemed quite inadequate for a person of her intelligence . " Of Albert he notes : " He appears to be well above average in intelligence , judging from his vocabulary and general knowledge . " Analysis of the Rorschach 1S7 The correlation between the intelligence-level ratings in the Rorschach and I.Q. was +.34 . Thematic analysis of the Picture-Story Test yields nothing that relates to mental functioning . However , the formal analysis of the stories sheds some light on mental functioning . figure Analysis of the Rorschach But on the positive side there is Sam ( 9 ) . His stories contain far more aggression than usual . Hostility , bitterness , and depressive tendencies are repressed or denied . There are fairly strong achievement themes of a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy is directed into his " persona " ? his social front , the appearance he permits to outsiders . Dr. Jensen was impressed by his poise during the interview , but his persona was threatened when he had to perform in a task ( the Picture-Story Test ) in which he had no practice or readymade ways of responding . Barbara ( 20 ) is another who shows some strength in the Picture-Story Test . Story B-10 tells of a woman who " lays down the law and brings things to a head , " insisting that her husband go to church with her . Story A-9 tells of a cleaning maid with push and gumption " to really go out and get her own place ? and I think she does . " As has been told , Barbara is bewildered about love and marriage , but in spite of her inability to relate successfully in a heterosexual fashion she has self-respect and certain strength and independence . The Picture-Story Test , it would seem , agrees rather faithfully with the picture presented by the Rorschach , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of the personality trends which must be guessed from the Rorschach. figure Anxiety and Defenses against Anxiety Fourteen individuals were mentioned in the Rorschach reports as experiencing anxiety with more or less intensity . In six of these subjects the anxiety was spoken of as intense , acute , pervasive . Four individuals were made anxious by social situations which they would tend to shun . In eight cases there was fear of experiencing strong emotion , and in two of these cases the emotion was specified as anger . Four subjects gave evidence of guilt , largely for hostile impulses which were not overtly expressed . Ten mechanisms of defense against anxiety were mentioned two or more times . One gathers the impression that more defense mechanisms could have been included in the reports , but Mrs. Dudek made no special effort to be exhaustive in this matter . Leading the list were repression and projection . Detachment and ego-defensive reactions ( chipon-the-shoulder attitude , combative , quarrelsome ) were mentioned twice . Other defense reactions were denial , intellectualization , overactivity , sour-grapes attitude , intellectual blocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find direct allusions to anxiety in the interview reports . Anxiety in human affairs does not stand out separately as anxiety but becomes imbedded in the personality and pervades all reactions in various ways , either by the defenses that have been adopted , or somatically , or by character formations . In almost every one of the interview reports on the fourteen subjects whom the Rorschach reported to be anxious , it was possible to find some evidence of anxiety , but when the other thirteen interview reports were reviewed it was possible to find the same signs of anxiety . It was not possible to find evidence of any correlation between anxiety reported in the Rorschach and in the interviews . Ralph ( z ) has a nervous stomach ; Roy ( 6 ) has high blood pressure ; Dorothy ( 30 ) describes herself as nervous with " butterflies in the stomach " when interviewed . But Seymour ( 36 ) , nonanxious by the Rorschach , also has a nervous stomach . Viola ( 14 ) is tense and high-strung ; Stella ( 19 ) worries about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome ( 7 ) , not anxious according to the Rorschach , worries over doctors ' bills ; Sam ( q ) worries over his mother 's nervous breakdowns ; Catherine ( 12 ) is anxious about her unborn child . // However , as one reviews the data there are a number of subjects not mentioned as anxious on the Rorschach who showed no sign of nervousness or tension in the interview . Natalie ( 21 ) was described as stable , realistic ; Olive ( 27 ) said that she had no fears or anxieties ; Seymour ( 36 ) , in spite of his nervous stomach , was on the whole good-natured and easygoing , while Edwin ( 33 ) was perhaps too easygoing for his own good . One may conclude that there is a barely discernible tendency for those diagnosed as anxious on the Rorschach to show signs of tension , strain , worry , or nervousness in real life , whereas the several not diagnosed as anxious on the Rorschach impressed the interviewer as stable , but there were too many exceptions for the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings for anxiety on the Rorschach and from Dr. Jensen 's ratings from the interview was +.18 . Likewise , no relation is discernible between anxiety as diagnosed from the Rorschach and anxiety evident in the Picture-Story Test . A comparison of the number of stories in which anxiety was expressed in the Picture-Story Test was made between those labeled anxious and nonanxious from the Rorschach , as shown in the accompanying tabulation. figure If anything , more anxiety in the stories was found for those designated nonanxious on the Rorschach , but the trend was not marked . The correlation between the Picture-Story anxiety and Dr. Jensen 's ratings for anxiety was +. o4. // figure Rorschach evaluations of drive are about equally divided between statements of high drive level and low drive level . Eleven subjects were characterized as assertive and active , seven as overreactive , and three as explosive . On the other hand , ten were credited with low drive and energy . Here , as with some of the other aspects of personality diagnosed from the Rorschach , there were contradictions and discrepancies . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facade , which could be the reverse of deeper trends in the personality . For instance , Catherine ( 12 ) " is overreactive but there is little evidence of spontaneous , outgoing affect . She is highly exhibitionistic with an overemphasis on physical appearance . She has little libidinal energy and is easily disturbed and coerced into submission where a fight is called for . " Edith ( 17 ) is said to have little drive or ambition to get ahead . At the same time she is said to be reactive and responsive , but merely as a result of a superego feeling of the need to be friendly and pleasant . She is likely to be competitive in a cute , little-girlish way . It was not possible to find a significantly high correspondence be166 Analysis of the Rorschach of control was made in the interview reports . Evidently this type of loss of control shown on the Rorschach is unrevealed in the interview situation . Ratings of control from the Rorschach correlated as +.34 with Dr. Jensen 's ratings of inhibition in behavior from the interview , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tendency to show self-control under frustration . From the contents of the Picture-Story Test it was not possible to estimate the degree or kind of control , but the formal aspects of the stories were quite revealing ( see page 48 ) . figure Depression Depression was mentioned in the Rorschach analysis of fourteen of the subjects . Eleven were characterized as having low-grade or slight depression . In subject 17 it was called acute , and in subject 29 fairly deep . Depression was mentioned in the interview reports of nine of the subjects ( 2 , 8 , I I , 13 , 17 , 19 , 20 , 27 , 31 ) . Possibly it was present in some of the others without being specifically named as such ? Albert ( 40 ) , for instance , was described as listless . It is significant that of these nine subjects five were not mentioned as having depressed tendencies on the Rorschach . On the other hand , ten of the fourteen subjects who were depressed according to the Rorschach interpretations were not so mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 8 , 17 , 27 , 31 ) who had depressed tendencies according to both sources of evidence . The tetrachoric r for this relationship is ? .18 , which is negligible . The Picture-Story Test has been mentioned already as indicating considerable depression in the adult subjects in this study , with marked increase over the depression indicated in the adolescent stories . Actually , depression was a theme in the stories of twenty-three of the twentyseven subjects for whom the Rorschach was available , leaving only four // subjects ( 1 , 11 , 33 , 39 ) in which depression was not observable . It was also not reported for three of these subjects in the Rorschach interpretations . On the other hand , the three subjects for whom depression was noted on the Rorschach had either no stories or only one containing a theme of depression . The correlation between the frequency with which depression appeared in the stories and the evaluation of depression from the Rorschach was ? .13 . One must conclude that there is no relationship between evidences of depression from the Rorschach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Picture-Story Test . Oedipal Relationships Mrs. Dudek hazarded guesses about the Oedipal forces which may have helped to determine some of the personality characteristics , particularly the sex role , of fifteen of the subjects . No effort has been made to tabulate these interpretations or to draw general conclusions from them , nor has any effort been made to relate these interpretations to the interview material . The Picture-Story Test , of course , provides much evidence as to attitudes- toward parent figures , but this is not of a nature permitting comparisons with these speculations from the Rorschach . Just a few illustrations are given to serve as samples of the kinds of Oedipal interpretations that were made from the Rorschach data . Ralph ( 2 ) has been described as an ineffectual person , still unmarried and attempting to graduate from an engineering school . An only child , he claims that he feels closer to his mother than to the stepfather he has had since he was i i or 12 . His mother impressed Dr. Jensen as being very protective . The Rorschach gives him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With regard to Oedipal relationships the Rorschach report mentions inability to identify with a weak father . The mother tried to play both masculine and feminine roles , neither one consistently . Roy ( 6 ) , also an only child , drives himself in his work in his father 's auto-repair shop and has high blood pressure . Roy is happily married and has two children . Overcontrolled , he seemed tense and inhibited in the interview . The Rorschach report finds that he has little identity as a person , with high regard for masculinity which he must demont68 Analysis of the Rorschach strate by self-assertion . As to Oedipal relationships , the Rorschach report says that he has had very little warm and positive contact with his parents . His relationship to his father is probably warmer than to his mother , but he fears aggression from his father . Roger ( 8 ) is another man with feelings of inferiority and confused sex-role identity , alternating between the masculine and feminine position . He has a stepmother with whom he has had some friction and by whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets along well with his father . The Rorschach report estimates the Oedipal situation as follows : " He finds it difficult to accept and feel accepted by a cold and powerful father who gave him no sense of humanity or importance ( made him feel small and rejected ) . His feelings toward women ( the mother ) appear to be much more friendly . " This , of course , is in direct conflict with his own statement . But his feelings of inferiority are real and there is no basis for explaining them from his own statement . One must give the Rorschach interpretation some credence as it provides a possible explanation for his lack of personal security . Catherine ( 12 ) has been mentioned many times because of her antagonism to her mother . In adolescence this appeared only in fantasy , but as an adult she can express her hostility openly . She also speaks unflatteringly about her father . The Rorschach refers to the immaturity of her psychosexual adjustment . With regard to the Oedipal situation , the Rorschach report says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rejection and disapproval by him . Mother may have made her feel unacceptable and unattractive . " Here the emphasis is on the relation with the father , whereas in the interview Catherine concentrates her feelings on her mother . Here , as elsewhere , the interview may soft-pedal the relationship which actually has been most influential . Nancy ( 3 I ) complains that marriage is confining , dull , and uninteresting . The Rorschach mentions that she is not sure of her femininity and finds it difficult to accept her role as wife . She falters between masculine and feminine attitudes . With regard to the Oedipal situation , the Rorschach report suggests an unresolved incestuous relationship with her father , whom she seemed to idealize . Her father disappointed her by not giving enough acceptance and acknowledgment . Her conscious feelings are more positive toward the mother , but basically it Analysis of the Rorschach i69 was her father 's love that she wanted . If this is true it may help to explain her present dissatisfaction with marriage . Seymour ( 36 ) is another person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his adequacy as a man , who needs to test his masculinity by a show of self-assertion . In the Navy he was tattooed on the arm . Actually , in real life a letter carrier , he avoids any pretense of being ambitious ( " Why strain yourself ? " ) and lets his wife make most of the decisions . The Rorschach says of the Oedipal relationship that Seymour never resolved the Oedipal tie with his mother . The relationship to her was close and sensually stimulating , but he made little contact with her as a real person . His father was more of a human being , but of whom he was secretly contemptuous . Jimmy ( 37 ) has been mentioned many times because of the strong dependence on his mother . He describes his mother as a dominating and strong character , but his father he speaks of with great respect as a fine and understanding man . Jimmy , too , is said by the Rorschach report to have confused sex-role identification . Of the Oedipal relationship , the Rorschach report says that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has strong fear of his father and of his disapproval of sex ( the angry . Oedipal taboo ) . There is a strong sense of dependence on his parents and of need to free himself of it . He has never resolved the incestuous tie to his mother . These speculations from the Rorschach reports on Oedipal relationships are parallel to the life history material in many instances , but sometimes run contrary to it . There are some indications that these Oedipal speculations may contain a germ of truth that helps to explain personality trends better than direct evidence from the interviews . As is well known , a person may not wish to reveal to the interviewer some of the deeper feelings and relationships to members of his family , or , as is probably more often the case , the individual is not aware himself of the depth and direction of his feelings . 8 . Summary of Comparisons between the Rorschach Reports , Interview Material , and Fantasies This chapter attempts to summarize comparisons between the Rorschach reports , the interview material , and the Picture-Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of each of these three kinds of data , although it should be noted that evidence as to the relationships between them leaves much to be desired . In general the Rorschach provides information about impulses and underlying tendencies , but such tendencies may have only a low relationship to the overt personality observed by the interviewer . Most persons have ways ( mechanisms ) for hiding or disguising their impulses and the expression of their underlying tendencies , especially in superficial contacts with a stranger . There is a natural tendency to put one 's best foot forward and to hide , disguise , or omit expression of impulses about which there is shame or guilt . This is particularly true with psychosexual adjustment , sex-role identity , aggression , and interpersonal relationships . The Rorschach may give a picture of sexual feeling and sex-role identification in so far as this is a matter of feeling or impulse , as well as of sex-related personality characteristics ( masculinity-feminity ) . But the Rorschach apparently can not diagnose overt sexual behavior with assurance of accuracy . Nor is sex-role identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overt personality . Not infrequently a man with feminine wishes may disguise these by an exaggerated overt masculinity . This lack of correspondence between the underlying tendencies and // ings or experiences with a stranger , certainly not in one or two contacts , and the general tendency is to give the impression of normality and satisfaction with regard to sex . Of the seven subjects who are not married , Ralph ( 2 ) is all in favor of marriage but does not believe one should rush into anything so important . He has had serious intentions toward three or four girls and is now going steady . From the Rorschach one learns that Ralph has a mild homosexual orientation with paranoid fears and is ambivalent toward women . Karl ( r i ) was candid in saying , " I do n't mind telling you I hope to remain a bachelor , I have no love life ; if you do n't have no love life , you do n't get married " ; but he added , " I am not shy of girls , or stuff like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a latent unconscious homosexual orientation and has much timidity with women . Isabel ( i 8 ) claims she is in no hurry to be married , although she would " love to marry . " She hates to be seen with a short man . She wants a man who is very good , from a nice family , who is religious , has a good job , is good to his mother , and is a good sport . From the Rorschach we learn that she has masochistic tendencies , and feels helpless and inadequate , but has strong penis envy . Barbara ( 20 ) , who told of strong competitive attitudes toward men , talked much about marriage , but stated that she had not found the right man yet . She insisted that she has no objections to necking or petting and that she was not a cold person sexually . But from the Rorschach we learn of her fears of heterosexual relationships , phallic worship , penis envy , and a wish to have been a man . She avoids men because she fears she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her aggressive impulses . Celia ( 28 ) is not too anxious to get married , but has not yet met the right man . She would rather have an independent single life than make the wrong choice and spend the rest of her life regretting it . She believes she is normal in her emotions and reactions , but she has very strict standards about premarital sex behavior . The Rorschach indicates much sex role confusion , sexual unresponsiveness and frigidity , and sadomasochistic attitudes toward men . John ( 39 ) has a poor opinion of marriage . He is looking for a goddess with both brains and beauty and has not found this combination . He claims that he has had much to do with models and actresses with plenty of opportunities to get married , but he ca n't see settling down to married life . The Rorschach indicates a strong feminine // identification and an alternation between passivity and aggressive selfassertion . Albert ( 40 ) is candid in saying that until recently he has been afraid of marriage . If a girl who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Since the interview was concluded , Albert has married . ) The Rorschach indicates a confused sexual identification with underlying homosexual conflicts and feelings of inadequacy as a man . There is castration anxiety and fear of sexual contacts with women . Space does not permit detailed discussion of the other cases of those who have married . Wallace ( i ) states that he enjoys married life and gets along well with his wife . He says that has was never wholly in love with any other woman , but claims that they may have thought so and that he let them think so only so that he could get things from them , implying sexual conquests on his part . The Rorschach indicates a fear of women as sexual objects , and he reacts to them as objects to be overpowered because he is unable to handle them with a sense of adequacy . Roy ( 6 ) speaks of a " harmonious marriage , " but the Rorschach indicates sexual repression and difficulties of control in sexual intercourse . Jerome ( 7 ) claims that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along very well together , that she is a devoted wife and mother . But the Rorschach tells of his being immature in psychosexual development , lacking in sensuality and eroticism and showing some of the effeminate traits of the feminine-passive character . Catherine ( i z ) was very frank in the interview about her sexual reactions . When first married she claimed she was frigid and sex was a real chore , but as a result of psychotherapy she now finds intercourse pleasant ? " she practically needs two husbands . " The Rorschach , however , is not so sanguine , finding that she is still unable to accept herself as an adult woman and has a tendency to oversexualize nonsexual situations . The Rorschach also points to much narcissism and need for body display . Laura ( 13 ) talked at length about her mother 's disfavor of her marriage . She and her husband are living with his mother . They practice birth control ( against the teachings of the Church ) until they are better established financially and can afford a child . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hypersensitive to sexual demands , and becomes restless , nervous , or frightened , and tightens up
