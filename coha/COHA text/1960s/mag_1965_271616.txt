NOT FOR PUBLICATION AND OTHER STORIES by Nadine Gordimer. 248 pages . Viking . $4.95 . South Africa is a land where blacks live in a limbo constructed by whites . In earlier novels and stories , Nadine Gordimer has coldly exposed the tensions of life along that hypocritical boundary . Her home country remains the setting for most of these 16 new stories , but the setting has become incidental ; the characters are caught in emotional suspensions that have no geographical limits . Gradwell , in The Pet , hates the bulldog kept by his white employers : " Symbol of all the white man 's savage glee in turning the black man from his door . " But the dog is something of a misfit himself : he refuses to bark at strangers , ignores the bitch brought around for mating purposes . He is indeed a great , slobbering , sheepish failure " always conscious of wrongdoing . " Hate turns to sympathy , as Gradwell recognizes his kinship with this other outsider : " He broke off a piece of bread and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Here ! ' " Miss Gordimer 's detachment competes with her lapidarian skill . Her stories glow , but with the gem fire that gives no warmth and sheds only reflected light . <P> <P> THE FLY by Richard Chopping . 291 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $4.95 . On the jacket of this book squats a huge hairy fly-no doubt attracted by the offal inside . There is Mrs. Macklin , a black widow in sweaty corsets , who works days as caretaker of a dreary British office and prowls the night looking for someone to take care of her ; Mr. Gender , an amorous Prufrock with boils ; Miss Jeacock , a withered office virgin who lures a young clerk to the ladies ' room and ecstatically dies of a surfeit . The clerk flees the jakes in horror but is blackmailed by Mrs. Macklin , who wants him for herself . But he can not face the supreme sacrifice she demands and winds up in a catatonic state in her broom closet . By profession , Author Chopping is a commercial artist-he designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eye is microscopically keen . Unhappily , it is riveted on the Excremental Vision . <P>
