The scene is the all-purpose living-dining-room of the THOMAS DESMOND McGARRYS in a house on the south shore of Long Island , about 100 miles out from New York City . It is their year-round residence , and this is the lived-in room . The furniture is for comfort and while in excellent taste does not reveal the hand of an interior decorator ; in fact it is more masculine-country style than otherwise . At Down Right is a door which opens on to the unseen kitchen , and near that door is a dinner table with chairs . At Left is a door which leads to an unseen bedroom . Upstage , the length of the room is a picture window at centre , to the right of which is a french window which offers entrance on a porchterrace , and to the left a non-practical french window . The time is June , 1951 . At rise we discover at Left THOMAS DESMOND McGARRY , M.D. , seated in a wheel chair at an angle . In front of him is a bridge table on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee he looks up every now and then and out toward Right , obviously watching some offstage goings on . McGARRY finishes his coffee , rings a small silver bell , and begins the business of filling and lighting his pipe . He is dressed in faded khaki pants , dark blue polo shirt , well-cared-for fringed loafers . Hanging from the back of the chair is a sturdy blackthorn with a black leather thong . He is a well-built man in his middle forties , somewhat overweight . A handsome elderly coloured woman answers the bell . She is CLAIBORNE CASEY , cook-housekeeper , wearing a light blue dress and white apron and white shoes . CLAIBORNE Can I get you some Floating Island ? p. 3 MCGARRY ( severely but friendly ) I told you , Claiborne . No desserts till the Fourth of July . ( He pats his belly . ) CLAIBORNE What you ought a do , you ought a let me stop putting butter on your butter dish . They was three there when I served you . I do n't see any now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . CLAIBORNE And sockrin . For lunch why do n't you use sockrin in your coffee instead of sugar ? ( She starts taking up the luncheon tray . ) MCGARRY It took me a long time to put on all this weight , so let me take it off gradually . ( Pointing with the bit of his pipe ) They all unloaded next door ? CLAIBORNE Well , I was n't watching too carefully  --   --  MCGARRY No , I 'll bet you were n't . CLAIBORNE  --  But I think they got the one car unloaded , the one the mother and daughter come in . The station wagon they 're still unloading . There 's a lot more stuff in there , of course . They got about fourteen pieces more of luggage , all the very finest valises and hatboxes , show-boxes , golf bags . Two shotgun cases . Who wants shotguns this time of the year ? They got that little boat on the roof of the station wagon , that ai n't unloaded yet . The lady , I would n't call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're doing all the work , but the wife she just stands there on the terrace looking out at the ocean . p. 4 MCGARRY I noticed that . CLAIBORNE I noticed it , too . I know who they got coming to work for them  --  Rose Franklin used to be with Mrs. Barnard last summer . You know Rose Franklin . MCGARRY Sure . CLAIBORNE Well , all I got to say , Mrs. Stranger-Next-Door , if she thinks Rose Franklin 's gon na wait on her hand and foot , she got another think coming . MCGARRY The new neighbour 's an actress , she probably has a lady 's maid . CLAIBORNE She better , if she thinks Rose Franklin 's gon na wait on her hand and foot . That 's why Rose Franklin would n't go back to Mrs. Barnard this summer . " I do n't have to go around picking up after anybody or nobody , " Rose said . But I do n't see no lady 's maid . Only the three of them : the mister and missus and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MCGARRY ( bored , takes a Newsweek out of chair pocket ) Mm-hmm . ( He starts to read , CLAIBORNE starts to leave with the luncheon things . ) CLAIBORNE Well , the mister ai n't losing any time getting acquainted . MCGARRY Hmm ? p. 5 CLAIBORNE You 're getting a visitor , the mister . Shall I let him in ? Through the windows up Right a tall , rather handsome man can be seen approaching the practical french window . He knocks and McGARRY calls . MCGARRY Come in . ARCHIE ( entering ) Good afternoon . Is this Doctor McGarry ? MCGARRY Yes , come right in . ARCHIE My name is Douglas . I 'm your new neighbour , brand new , as a matter of fact . MCGARRY ( politely extending his hand ) Welcome to Midhampton . ARCHIE Thanks a lot . I hate to bother you , but I 've had a dreadfully serious accident . May be fatal . Are you taking new patients , Doctor McGarry ? MCGARRY Well , not exactly . What 's the trouble ? DOUGLAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes . ARCHIE We just drove down from New York and the confounded lighter in my car would n't work . Tried to light a cigarette while on the move . Whole book of matches blew up in my hand . MCGARRY A damned nuisance , and painful . p. 6 ARCHIE Well , I do n't like to baby myself , but I 'm a bit worried about infection . I infect at the drop of a microbe , you know , and we actors  --  I 'm an actor  --  we 're all such hypochondriacs . Do you think I 'll lose my hand ? Will you have to cut it off here and now ? MCGARRY Oh , I think we can save the hand . Have a seat . DOUGLAS sits down and McGARRY takes another look at the hand . MCGARRY The best protection you have is right here , the skin , the blister . I 'm glad you did n't open it up . A lot of people make that mistake . I 'll put a little something on it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be using the hand ? ARCHIE Well , yes . A lot of unloading and unpacking . MCGARRY I do n't like to put a dressing on , but in that case I will . ( He rings the silver bell and CLAIBORNE enters . ) MCGARRY Claiborne , in the bottom row of the medicine chest you 'll find a small tube without a label , about two and a half inches long . The tube looks like soft tin . Bring it to me please , and the box of large Band-aids and a cotton finger . CLAIBORNE The burn stuff ? MCGARRY Right . ( She exits . ) Cigarette , Mr. Douglas ? ( Pushes a silver box towards DOUGLAS , who takes one , and McGARRY holds a lighter for him. ) p. 7 MCGARRY Lighters have their uses , all right . ARCHIE I must have fifty , truly , fifty cigarette lighters , but did I have one today ? Oh , no . Oh , dear me , no . Is n't that always the way ? MCGARRY Mm-hmm . How did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now was n't that clever of me ? MCGARRY Yes , it was . My name is on the little sign in the drive-way , but no M.D. , or D.R. How did you know ? ARCHIE The licence plate on your car , Doctor . I 've been over here long enough to 've noticed that . 2 M D 366 . MCGARRY 2 M D 388 , but that 's very good . But how come our car 's in the driveway ? My wife  --  no , she did n't take it today , that 's right . A friend stopped for her . Well , here we are . ( He starts attending the burn as CLAIBORNE stands by . He works quickly and efficiently , talking the while . ) I 'll give you a prescription for a tube of this stuff . It 's very expensive , but you can use it sparingly . In fact , you should use it sparingly , and it 's not a bad thing to have around . There we are . ARCHIE Very neat . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sort of conversation piece , and I 'll make up some wild tale to go with the dressing . p. 8 MCGARRY Would you like a cup of coffee , a drink ? ARCHIE Do you know what I would like ? If you have it ? I 'd like a Coke . I have n't wet my whistle since we left New York , over three hours ago . It does n't seem quite fair to my wife and my stepdaughter , but they did n't burn their finger , did they ? MCGARRY Claiborne , could we have two Cokes , please ? ( She exits . ) I understand you 've taken the Worthington place till September . ARCHIE Yes , in fact till October , although I do n't expect I 'll be here much in October . MCGARRY Rehearsing ? ARCHIE Yes , but how did you know ? MCGARRY Only a guess . ARCHIE There 's been nothing in the papers about it , not that it 's a deep-dyed secret , but I do expect to go into rehearsal about the fifteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a totally unknown young Frenchman . Are you interested in the theatre ? MCGARRY I used to be . I saw you in Young Mrs. Blackwell , 1934 . One of the last plays I saw . ARCHIE Oh , you did ? That was a good play . I was all wrong about it , you know . I thought it was a sure hit for New York . ( The Cokes are served and CLAIBORNE leaves . ) Cheers ! p. 9 MCGARRY Cheers . ARCHIE We ran well over a year in London , and here we did less than fifty performances . Was it the Depression , do you s'pose ? MCGARRY It may have been . No , I think it was just too English . Sometimes , you know , we 'll take fifteen English plays , one right after the other , all so bloody English that I do n't believe half the audience understands them , but then the sixteenth will come along , and we just wo n't have it , no part of it . ARCHIE Perhaps you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our God damn faces . Not to mention our accents . Did you ever act , or write for the theatre ? MCGARRY No . Just went . ARCHIE Interesting thing about doctors , all over the world . It 's very seldom doctors do n't like the theatre . But you said a moment ago , Young Mrs. Blackwell was one of the last plays you saw . Do n't you ever go up to New York ? MCGARRY Never . I 've been in this vehicle since 1934 . No , since 1935 . I did n't have one of these in ' 34 . I was in the hospital for almost a year . Then I bought this place . I was in an aeroplane accident in ' 34 and my legs were pretty badly bunged up . ARCHIE Say , that was hard luck . That must have been very soon after you became a doctor . p. 10 MCGARRY Two years after . ARCHIE And you live here the year ' round . I must say I think I 'd rather like that , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came here because I wanted to be on the ocean , just to look out on it . I did n't want to see my friends , and I wanted to forget all about being a doctor . ARCHIE Then you gave up your practice ? MCGARRY During the war this was two rooms . I took office patients , more or less to ease the pressure on the local man . One of the two local men joined the Navy and the other was working himself to death , so I hung out my shingle temporarily , but I gave it up in ' 47 . Very dull work , office work , when you started out to be a surgeon . ARCHIE But do n't you get bored ? MCGARRY No , not very . I listen to the ball games on the radio . I wrote three-quarters of a book a few years ago , till I found that somebody else had written a much better book on the same subject . I 'm class secretary , so I have a voluminous correspondence . Very conscientious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlimited , and I give them extensive reports on the duck situation . Two years ago I took up painting and I 'm having a one-genius show at the library fairly soon . I 'm a member of the Village Historical Society , in fact I 'm secretary of that too . You 'd be surprised how much history took place around here . I was I was an aeroplane spotter during the war . Got a little confusing with my duck-watching , but no serious damage done . And I have quite a social life . We usually have people here for Sunday lunch all year round and Saturday night we have a poker game and Tuesday night a bridge game . I do n't say it 's a useful life , but the days pass quickly , one into another . And finally , a man can always get drunk . A man can get drunk , and the little chores pile up , and you have to work extra hard for two or three days while you make up for lost time . Of course it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't know what I was meant to do , or to be . At least I 'm less sure than I used to be . p. 11 ARCHIE I should say you have a very full life . MCGARRY Full of what , Mr. Douglas ? ARCHIE Well , I do ' know . I take it you always wanted to be a doctor , and I s'pose I always wanted to be an actor and I still am one . But it 's all I know how to be . It might be interesting to have some accident that would put a quick , final stop to my acting career . Suppose , for instance , those matches instead of putting a baby blister on my thumb , what if I 'd blinded myself , or burnt my face beyond repair  --  some accident that would take me off the stage for ever . I wonder what I 'd do to occupy my time . You , you seem to have adjusted yourself to your new way of life . Just from these few minutes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've made yourself a sort of schedule to keep yourself occupied . MCGARRY Mr. Douglas , are you trying to comfort me ? ARCHIE Well , maybe I am . I beg your pardon . I do n't mean to be patronizing . But when I came in here I did n't get an impression of an unhappy invalid in an invalid 's chair . Then you told me these things about yourself and  --  well , I think you 've done your-self proud . You must have had one hell of a bad time in the beginning , and what I 'm really trying to say is that if something put an end to my career , I do n't think I 'd be able to adjust as well as you have . p. 12 MCGARRY Thank you . ARCHIE ( suddenly nervous ) I  --  uh  --  I must go now , thank you very much , Doctor . What about your fee ? Will you send me a bill , or shall I pay you now or what ? MCGARRY Well , I 've more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee since I took the M.D. off my sign . Tell you what you do . The fire company will be around asking for contributions next month , and when they do , you donate an extra five dollars to them . I 'm a member of the fire company too . As DOUGLAS rises to leave MARY McGARRY enters from the kitchen . MCGARRY Oh , I 'd like you to meet my wife . Mary , this is Mr. Douglas , our new neighbour . ARCHIE How do you do . MARY How do you do . I see you 've arrived . What can we do to help you get settled ? ARCHIE Well , thanks a lot , Mrs. McGarry . The doctor 's already been helping . Wounded myself with some exploding matches . MARY Oh . Hard luck Would n't you and Mrs. Douglas and your daughter like to take pot luck with us tonight , about seven-fifteen ? I happen to know that your cook wo n't arrive till tomorrow . I saw her in the village and she asked me to tell Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure we 'd be delighted . MARY Fine . And tell Mrs. Douglas I 'll drop in a little later this afternoon to see if there 's anything I can do . Lists , you know . The names of the market people , drug store , so forth . I 'll make up a list and bring it over later . For instance , you ought to apply for a post office box first thing tomorrow  --  but I 'll take it all up with Mrs. Douglas . ( She waves a fairly good-sized stack of mail as she speaks , then places it on McGARRY 'S bridge table . ) ARCHIE You 're both very kind . MARY And meanwhile we 'll definitely expect all three of you at seven-fifteen ? ARCHIE You 're sure it 's no trouble ? It is , of course . MARY It 's not only pot luck , it 's pot roast , but Claiborne does it very well . ARCHIE Goo ' - bye . He exits . MARY sits down and lights a cigarette . She is a woman in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf and tennis . A smartly tweedy dressed woman and obviously a social cut or two above her husband . MARY He seemed pleasant enough . Have you seen her ? MCGARRY ( thumbing through the mail ) I did n't get a very good look at her . p. 14 MARY And they have a young daughter . MCGARRY Stepdaughter . MARY ( keenly ) Did n't you like him ? MCGARRY He 's all right , I guess . Those bastards always make me talk too much . MARY What bastards ? MCGARRY The English . God knows they talk enough themselves , but I always feel that I was the one that did the talking , and too much of it . I told him the story of my life while I was putting a Band-aid on his thumb . MARY And he did n't tell you his ? MCGARRY No , by God , he certainly did not . He was far from frank . On the top shelf there , see if you can reach it , there 's a British Who 's Who , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Left and stands on a chair . MCGARRY The last book on the right . MARY ( extracting it ) Here we are . Who 's Who. 1942 . Not Who 's Who in America . I do n't think I 've ever looked at this before . MCGARRY It belonged to your father . That time he gave me an encyclopedia and a big batch of reference books ? p. 15 MARY When you were writing your own book . MCGARRY ( nodding and thumbing through the book ) Douglas , Douglas , Douglas . Here we are . Douglas , Archie . Actor , born 29 April 1902 . MARY Hmm . Does n't look that . MCGARRY He 's kept slender running away from women . MARY He does n't seem that type to me , but I 've never seen him before . MCGARRY Not even in the movies ? MARY Now how often do I go to the movies ? MCGARRY I imagine there are quite a few women that only go to the movies to see Archie Douglas . ( Quoting ) First appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war ? Served in Navy 1918-19 . He must have been just a kid . Of course they do take them in younger than we do . Films . Zum zum zum zum zum zum . Plays . Zum zum zum zum . Young Mrs. Blackwell . That 's the one I saw him in . It was a flop . At least over here . He was pretty good in it , but it was a lousy play . Clubs . Garrick , that 's a theatrical club in London , and The Players , New York . Yes , I remember a story about his being blackballed at the Racquet Club . MARY Now how did you know that ? p. 16 MCGARRY Your brother told me . I gather he was put up for the Racquet and he went around to meet the committee and he was wearing some tie that looked like a Racquet Club tie , and they gave him the heave-ho . MARY I do n't believe it . MCGARRY It 's your brother 's story , not mine . Recreations :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : tennis , photography , shooting . Shooting ? MARY Are n't you skipping a lot . What about her ? MCGARRY Married Anna Root , 1931 . Address : care of Music Corporation of America . That 's a theatrical agency . MARY Musical Corporation . Is he a musician too ? MCGARRY Not that I know of . Now let 's have a look at her . Root . R , R , R , R , Root . Root , Anna . Actress . Born , Vienna , does n't say when . Daughter of Herman and Anna Reuther . Married Ernst Schmidt . Marriage dissolved . It does n't say when for any of these things . Child dancer in Vienna , Paris , Berlin , London . Plays : Zum zum zum zum . None I ever heard of . Films . Zum zum zum . Does n't give any address for her . But she 's good . She has a big European reputation . MARY What about recreations ? p. 17 MCGARRY ( pretending to read ) Recreations : Nocturnal . Also matines Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say she was very discreet , at least when it comes to giving out the facts about herself . Did you notice some-thing I noticed ? MARY I notice she did n't mention having a daughter . MCGARRY That 's right . And also she did n't mention Douglas . He mentions her , but she does n't mention him . MARY Well , I guess if he mentions her they must be married , all right . MCGARRY Yes , we wo n't have to ride them out of town on a rail . MARY Probably what that means , her not mentioning Douglas , she probably was married three or four times and just did n't like to boast . MCGARRY Just as long as they 're married . Ca n't have any of that stuff going on around here . MARY You may joke about it , but you 'd be the first to object . MCGARRY I probably would . MARY Any fascinating mail ? p. 18 MCGARRY Why , I always have fascinating mail . You know that . ( He picks up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to him , stands behind him and rubs his shoulders , a gesture of tenderness as much as a relaxing massage . ) MARY How are you feeling ? MCGARRY How am I feeling ? Why , the same as usual . I always feel the same . You know that . MARY ( smiling ) I know nothing of the kind . I do n't know any-one that changes as much as you do , from day to day , from hour to hour . When I left here you were in very good spirits . But when I come back two hours later MCGARRY I have n't noticed any change in myself . Will you stop being Daddy 's Little Helper , the Ladies Home Journal wife ? MARY ( strolling to the windows ) If those people bother you , we wo n't have to see them . We can have them over tonight , and I can make the neighbourly gestures , but we wo n't ever have to see them again all summer . I can handle them . MCGARRY I wish you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm perfectly capable of handling my own affairs . As a matter of fact , I 'm getting fat and stale and , as a matter of fact , bored . With myself . I ca n't jump around and play tennis or drive the car , but I have plenty of strength to do other things that do n't involve my using my legs . I 'm no cripple . ( He laughs . ) Well , of course that 's exactly what I am , but that 's all I am , I 'm only a cripple . I 've got to find some new thing to do , with my hands , or with my brains , it does n't matter which , just so it 's something . p. 19 MARY What did you and Mr. Douglas talk about ? MCGARRY That had nothing to do with what I 'm saying now . MARY Did n't it ? MCGARRY No . So get over this analytical thing . Do n't start seeing changes in me that have n't happened , and do n't start attributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARY Did he have a bad burn ? MCGARRY Pretty bad , for that kind of a burn . Second degree anyway . I would n't say he was the bravest little soldier in the world . He was trying to make light of it , you know . Pretending to joke about it . But the very fact that he put on such an act  --   --  I 've seen people stabbed in Harlem that took it better than he did . MARY Well , he 's an actor . I suppose they have to make a big thing of everything . MCGARRY Exactly . MARY He 's the first patient you 've had since  --   --  MCGARRY Since you . Last summer when I set your finger . And do n't think I do n't see your line of thinking . MARY I 'm sure I  --   --  MCGARRY Oh , come on , Mary . I can read your mind . You come back from the village and you think I 'm upset about something , which I 'm not . But you think I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he upset me. p. 20 MARY Have it your own way . During these speeches she has had her back turned , is looking out of the window . A change of attitude indicates that she has finished with the subject and is interested in something else . MARY She 's going for a walk . MCGARRY Who is ? MARY Mrs.  --  Next Door . Douglas . Uh-uh . ( Jumps back behind a drape . ) She just looked up . I wonder if she saw me . MCGARRY What if she did ? You have a perfect right to  --   --  MARY I would n't want her to think I was staring at her . MCGARRY You can look out of your own window . Remember , we were here first . MARY She kicked off her shoes and now she 's striding up the beach . Striding , that 's the only word for it . She 's going to have stiff legs tomorrow , walking in that sand barefoot . MCGARRY How are her legs ? Has she got ballet dancer legs ? MARY Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not bad . MCGARRY She started out as a dancer , I think . MARY She was a child dancer . It said so in that book . She has a dog . p. 21 MCGARRY Oh , Lord . What kind of a dog ? MARY Chesapeake . MCGARRY Oh , God . Big , and noisy . MARY But they 're friendly . MCGARRY They 're too damn friendly . I think I 'll get a water pistol and fill it full of ammonia . MARY You ca n't do that . MCGARRY Oh , ca n't I just ? You tell Claiborne , not a scrap of food for that damn dog . Or maybe some nice chop bones . That 'll fix him . And the first night he howls , believe me , Mr. and Mrs. Douglas get a nice sharp letter in the morning . MARY My word . She 's standing in front of the Holdens ' house and just staring . Lucky for her they 're not home . They 'd stare right back at her , stare for stare . MCGARRY Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl doing ? MARY Well , they seem to have all the luggage out of the two cars , all piled up on the terrace . They have a little outboard motor-boat on the roof of the station wagon . MCGARRY Uh-huh . MARY He and the girl seem to be talking about it . They 're probably discussing whether to take it off the roof . Do n't take it off , you fools . Leave it there , then you wo n't have to lift it on again when you take it over to the bay . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Was n't I smart . That 's exactly what they decided . He said something to the girl , then she pointed toward the bay , and he nodded , and now they 're leaving the car and going up to the terrace . Now he 's putting his arm around her . Around her waist . And she 's putting her arm around his waist , and they 're walking in step . She 's his step daughter , is n't she ? p. 22 MCGARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good figure . ( She pauses . ) MCGARRY What ? MARY I ca n't make up my mind . MCGARRY About what ? MARY It may be entirely innocent , but ( turning to McGARRY ) it 's suddenly very exciting to me . ( Vaguely ) He did n't make a pass , only put his arm around her , and she hers around him . That 's all they did . Tom . She bends down and kisses him and despite the awkwardness of his position , he takes her in his arms as the curtain slowly descends. p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO The same as Scene One . Evening . ( Curtain lowered to indicate passage of intervening time . ) Seated at the dinner table , at Right , are TOM McGARRY ( in his wheel chair ) , ZITA SCHMIDT ( the twenty-year-old daughter of ANNA ) , ARCHIE DOUGLAS , MARY McGARRY , and ANNA ROOT DOUGLAS , in that order clockwise .

If the managers only knew it , I 'd be happy to play in New York without salary , provided the managers agreed to pay me in lemon meringue pie , and cheese cake . Do you know Lindy 's , Mrs. McGarry ? MARY I do n't think I do . What are they ? ARCHIE They are a restaurant . A Mr. Lindy . MCGARRY Leo Lindy . I know about him . It 's a hangout for song writers and theatrical people . MARY Oh , like Sardi 's . ARCHIE Like  --  and so unlike . At Lindy 's every gentleman must somehow contrive to eat while smoking a very large cigar . Apparently it 's against the rules for the male patrons to eat without a Corona-Corona in his kisser . That 's Lindyese for face . Every gentleman is required to have a heater in his kisser . Heater is Lindyese for cigar , and kisser is Lindyese for face . ( He speaks quickly , with a certain amount of nervousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing most of the talking through dinner and , by their manner , his wife and stepdaughter have been contributing little conversationally . As a social occasion , the dinner has not been a success . ) Well , the reason I know so much about Lindy 's is I discovered it on my first trip to this country and on my first visit to Lindy 's I ate some of his famous cheese cake . Since that lucky day I have eaten  --  conservative estimate  --  fourteen tons of the stuff , and I hope to live to eat fourteen tons more . As to lemon meringue . I 've almost never had a bad piece of that . p. 24 MCGARRY You 've been lucky . ARCHIE I know I have . My favourite , I think , up to now , is at a little delicatessen in Sixth Avenue . Up to now . My new favourite , far and away the best I ever ate , was this , tonight . And I know why . It 's because the crust is better . I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaky . MARY There 's half the pie still left . You can take it home with you when you leave . ARCHIE May I ? I 'll take you up on that , you know , and I 'll probably eat it all before I go to bed . But I ca n't go on making a spectacle of myself at table . And I 'm holding everybody up . ( They all rise , except McGARRY , who spins his chair around toward Left . ) You , Doctor , you have an iron will . You never touch desserts , you say ? With these lemon meringues right within reach ? MCGARRY I have n't had a dessert of any kind since the day before yesterday . ARCHIE Oh , some sort of diet . MCGARRY Some sort . ARCHIE Then it must have been torture to sit there and watch me put away two enormous wedges of that pie . MCGARRY Torture 's a strong word for it . By the way , how 's your thumb coming along ? p. 25 ARCHIE Oh , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put you to sleep if the pain 's too severe . DOUGLAS gives him a quick look to see if sarcasm is intended ; he can not decide . ARCHIE I do n't think I 'll need it , Doctor . ZITA ( to MARY ) Could n't I help with the dishes , Mrs. McGarry ? MARY Oh , no thanks , Zita . Claiborne does n't really like to be helped , and besides in a little while you 'll hear the Queen Mary , that 's our electric dishwasher . MCGARRY ( to DOUGLAS ) Cigar , Douglas ? ARCHIE You having one ? MCGARRY No . Pipe and cigarettes are all I smoke , but I 've got some pretty good heaters . Not Corona-Corona , but cigar smokers seem to like them . ARCHIE Are we all staying together ? In here ?

ANNA So long as the tobacco is burning a pipe I do not mind . Some pipe tobaccos can be rather fragrant . But a cigar is vile , vile in its odour , vile in appearance . I do not care for cigars . MCGARRY Yes , I knew a female doctor that smoked cigars . It gave her the appearance of masculinity , not that she needed it . ANNA I was speaking of a male homosexual , but of course my theory holds true in both cases . ARCHIE Nevertheless I 'm going to have my cigar , no matter how it affects my reputation . Do you want me to give you a push , Doctor ? MCGARRY I can manage , thanks . ( He wheels himself through the french window , followed by DOUGLAS . They sit on the terrace in full view of the women , but their conversation is unheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you prefer to be called Miss Root , or Mrs. Douglas ? ANNA On such occasions , Mrs. Douglas . ( Implying on occasions such as this . ) Professionally I am always known as Miss Root . It really makes no difference . Whatever comes to your mind . But in the theatre or the films , always Miss Root . p. 27 MARY I see . I was just thinking : there is n't any couple known as Mr. and Mrs. , is there ? ANNA I should think not . What a risk ! To create a reputation as Mr. and Mrs. , and then the husband goes off with some little chippie and the wife must still be known as Mrs. So-and-So . I should think not . MCGARRY ( calling out ) Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew . MARY What did you say , dear ? MCGARRY Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew , a famous acting couple . ANNA I never heard of them . MARY We never heard of them , and you 're not supposed to be eavesdropping . MCGARRY So sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a liqueur ? We have quite a selection as you see . ( There is a portable bar at Left . ) Brandy , Cointreau , crme de menthe , Benedictine . ANNA This much Cointreau , please . ( She holds up her fingers . ) MARY Zita ? ZITA Well  --  Benedictine , but let me help . p. 28 MARY ( to ZITA , then going to doorway ) Would you tell Claiborne we 're ready for the coffee ? Mr. Douglas ? Coffee ? ARCHIE Please . No sugar . MARY Tom . Are you having coffee ? MCGARRY Small . Black . And do n't forget us when the booze is being passed around . ( Inaudible question to DOUGLAS . ) ARCHIE Brandy for both . I 'll get it . He comes in off the terrace and waits for the pouring of the brandy , takes it out , comes in again for the coffee and exits with same . During these actions ANNA takes a small gold cigarette case from her bag and lights a cigarette , and coolly inspects the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touches the British Who 's Who , which has been left lying on an end table . She pushes it around and looks at the spine , reading the title . She glares at MARY , unnoticed by MARY or any-one else . MARY is covering ANNA 'S by-play by being busy with the drinks . At length MARY sits down , having poured herself a brandy . The only talk necessary during this phase is the necessary here-you-are and thank-you , so that dialogue does not take away from ANNA 'S discovery of the Who 's Who. p. 29 ANNA ( rising ) May I ? ( Implying use the bathroom . ) MARY Through the bedroom . ANNA exits up Left . MARY devotes herself to ZITA . MARY Are you planning a theatrical career , Zita ? ZITA I 'm afraid not . Papa  --  he 's not really my father , you know . My stepfather . MARY I knew that . ZITA My actual father is dead . I never saw him . MARY Then you never missed him . ZITA Oh , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious about him and his family , my family . My uncles and aunts . I must have cousins still alive in Austria and Germany . I 've never seen any of them or heard from them . Mama was divorced and went to England and my real father stayed in Vienna . Then when Hitler came to power we could never go back . Mama was very outspoken against Hitler and it would have been worth her life  --  mine , too  --  if she 'd taken me to Vienna . Then we heard my father was dead . MARY Killed fighting Hitler ? ZITA ( uncomfortably ) I do n't exactly know for sure . Mama does n't like to speak about him . Now that I 've grown up I realize what I did n't realize as a child  --  that the divorce was very bitter , acrimonious . I used to think Mama did n't talk about my real father out of courtesy to Archie . But as I grew up , little things here and there . I understand that my real father , Mr. Schmidt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I could go over there and find out about myself , my family . But my papers  --  jeepers ! What a mess they 're in . I do n't dare leave the country . Born in Vienna , brought up in England till I was fourteen , and Mama married to an Englishman , and the Englishman is changing to American citizenship . I do n't even dare go to Bermuda . The girls at school wanted me to go to Bermuda this spring , but Papa 's lawyer strongly advised against it . p. 30 MARY What are you ? ZITA Technically , English , a British subject , because I was legally adopted by Papa . But I want to be an American . I 've been living here and going to school here for six years . All my friends are here , except for one or two girls I still write to in England , but mostly they write to thank me for CARE packages . I have n't seen them during those all-important adolescent years , and the friendships are childhood friendships . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you go ? ZITA Sarah Lawrence . Before that , the Brearley . MARY And not going on the stage ? You have the looks . ZITA You should hear Mama on that subject . They practically made me do dramatics at the Brearley , naturally , with Mama and Papa , but Mama went to see me just once and said : Powers Model ! That 's all she said . Powers Model ! In other words , nothing inside . And , I guess she 's right . I certainly have n't got the ambition to work as hard as she did to get where she is . Ballet , singing , piano , elocution lessons . Apparently her mother was just the opposite . She always wanted Mama to be an actress and trained her for it all her life . She did n't have any real childhood . Of course that 's the way they do over there . In the Russian ballet , you know , they used to take children when they were six years old and that 's all they ever learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ZITA I ask myself that question every day . At the Brearley I wanted to be Emily Dickinson . MARY In my day it was Edna St. Vincent Millay . ZITA Did you go to the Brearley too ? MARY No , I 'm afraid I went to Spence , but my literary friends adored Edna St. Vincent Millay . ZITA Oh , she was good . I like some of her things . MARY I did at the time , but I was never very intellectual . I 'm just perfectly suited to my present job . ZITA Oh , you have a job ? MARY Oh , yes . I run the children 's department at the Village library . Monday , Wednesday , and Friday . I order the books , and I read them too . And I must say I enjoy them . That 's as far as my brain developed . ZITA Children 's books are much better than they used to be . MARY Yes , that probably explains why some of them are rather deep for me . But then after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I wrote some short stories . I sent a few of them to The New Yorker and one of them did n't come back with a rejection slip . I actually got a little note . They said it was too special , but " please try us soon again " . I showed the note to my English teacher and she told me not to let it go to my head . p. 32 MARY That was n't very nice of her . ZITA Oh , she was joking . She said she 'd sent stuff to The New Yorker for over ten years before she got anything but a rejection slip . She has sold some things there , and the Kenyon Review . MARY Did you keep on with your writing ? ZITA My writing ! How important that sounds ! No , I have n't really done any writing lately . I got terribly interested in skiing and consequently I almost flunked out of college , and it 's not easy to flunk out of Sarah Lawrence . You have to put your mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outboard racing . I have a boat , I brought it down here . I understand they do a lot of it on the bay . MARY From morning to night , it seems to me . Bizzt . Bizzt . Bizzt-bizzt-bizzt . ZITA I have a friend that raced in the Albany to New York race . Finished , too , and that 's quite an achievement . MARY Is he a skier , too ? ZITA Yes . The same one . MARY Where is he ? ZITA At Williams . His home is in Rye . MARY Well , that 's not too far away . There 's a nice crowd of girls your age here . When your friend comes down I 'll have them in to meet you . Do you sail ? p. 33 ZITA A little , but the sailboat crowd call outboards stinkpots . Horrible name . MARY ( smiling ) They still do ? I know we used to . ZITA I have a feeling I 'm not going to be very popular here . MARY Do n't worry about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woods , and sail has the right of way . You must take me for a ride some time . ZITA I 'd love to . MARY And some day when you 're feeling like a quiet sail you come along and crew for me . I have a small boat that I go out in about three times a summer . ANNA ( she returns ) The water-colours in the bedroom , they are the doctor 's , not yours ? MARY Yes , he did them . Did you like them ? ANNA Two of them very interesting . The head , it 's your cook , of course ? MARY Yes , but that is n't one of his water-colours . ANNA I realize that . MARY As a matter of fact it was his first picture . ANNA It 's very strong , very interesting . Then to look at the water-colours , so different . I knew the oil was a man 's , that 's why I asked you to make sure , because the water-colours could have been painted by a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She goes to bathroom . ) ANNA Doctors begin with a great advantage because they have studied anatomy . MARY It is an advantage , yes . At least when you 're painting people . ANNA Oh , a tremendous advantage , Mrs. McGarry . Have you ever painted ? MARY Never . ANNA Then you have no idea . To know the bones , bone structure . Oh , I found that out when I was painting . MARY You painted too ? ANNA Not well . I was dissatisfied and gave it up when I saw how long it would take to learn properly . For example , anatomy . MARY I imagine you 're very thorough . From what Zita said . ANNA What did Zita say , may I ask ? MARY Well , just how thoroughly you studied for the theatre . ANNA I was very thoroughly trained , yes . But training is not all . For the theatre one needs  --  basic . In here . Unfortunately Zita did n't have it . Did she tell you I said that ? MARY Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in herself , and when she asked me , I told her so . I thought it would be cruel to have her go on , training for years and years . It would have been very cruel . p. 35 MARY Unless , of course , she got pleasure out of the training . ANNA The training is drudgery , believe me , Mrs. McGarry . MARY Well , you know more about that than I do . Of course there 's this to consider : for example , Zita might have had fun uh  --  dabbling in the theatre . You did n't have any fun dabbling in painting , but Zita might have a different attitude . My husband 's attitude toward painting . He was never more than the rankest amateur . ANNA But as I said before , he knew anatomy . MARY Well , I do n't see how his knowledge of anatomy helped him with the water-colours , the one of the boat on the sand , for instance . The still life of the bottle and the apple and pear on the chequered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat than he does , but I could never have painted that picture . ANNA But you 're not interested in painting . MARY Exactly . And my husband is . ANNA Oh , I see what you 're driving at . The defence of the amateur . MARY That may be it . I may have been defending the amateur without being conscious of it . ANNA Actually what fascinated me about your husband 's painting was what it told me about him . When he paints a human being , your Negro cook , for instance , he is on sure ground and the picture is strong and masculine . The still lifes and one of the seascapes , they might have been painted by an altogether different person . Not even a person of the same sex . p. 36 MARY Well , I have no reason to doubt his masculinity . ANNA Naturally . MARY Well , it is n't always taken for granted , you know . He did have that accident . ANNA Tell me about it , if it is n't too painful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't even know him when it happened . I knew him two minutes later . I fished him out of the water . He was flying an aeroplane over Long Island Sound and something happened to the motor and he crashed . I was sailing in a race and when I saw him crash I went to where he was and got him out of the plane . ANNA He owes his life to you . MARY Literally , yes . Although I just happened to be the first there . There were a dozen other people in the race , any one of whom would have rescued him . In fact , some others did . What I did was keep him afloat till another boat arrived . He was unconscious , and the condition his legs were in , he would n't have been able to swim even if he had n't lost consciousness . Both legs and one arm were broken  --  multiple fractures  --  and most of his ribs . The motor was pushed back on him . ANNA How did you get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It was shallow water . I might have left him in the plane but it caught fire . p. 37 ANNA You were very brave . MARY Yes , I got a medal for it . I got a medal and a husband . ANNA When was this ? MARY The accident was in 1934 . We were married the next year , 1935 . ANNA And he was an invalid . I think that was even braver than rescuing him from the plane . MARY No , that took no bravery . I was in love with him . ANNA And obviously still are , Mrs. McGarry . MARY I hope it 's obvious , but whether it is or not it 's true . ANNA And you have no children ? MARY No children . During this conversation ZITA returns from the bathroom and wanders casually out to the terrace , returns , takes brandy bottle to terrace and remains talking with the men . ANNA I would not be capable of rescuing a stranger from a burning aeroplane . MARY You do n't know till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have married an invalid . MARY You do n't know that , either . Women have fallen in love with Tom since we 've been married . p. 38 ANNA Oh , please do n't misunderstand me . Dr. McGarry is charming , utterly attractive . It 's just how one is made up , do n't you know . I can readily imagine Zita doing these things . Zita is very much like you in certain ways , do n't you agree ? MARY I 'm complimented . She 's a lovely girl . ANNA I mean it as a compliment , but also to illustrate the differences between myself and my daughter . To begin with , of course , I would not be in a boat on the Long Island Sound . Zita spends half her life in boats , the other half on skis . Do you ski , Mrs. McGarry ? MARY Before I was married . My family had a house up the Hudson and I suppose I skied before most girls did , American girls . ANNA I skied when I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Austria . It was a means of getting to school . I hated it . I loved skating . MARY Well , of course that 's more like dancing , the ballet . ANNA Precisely . I have skated at Radio City but then they spoil it by taking my picture and asking for autographs . This is all right for the Powers models , but I went there to relax . MARY That sort of thing must happen to you all the time , but I suppose you must expect it . p. 39 ANNA Expect it , perhaps . Welcome it , no . God knows , we have had enough of it ! MARY Well , the penalty of fame , I suppose . ANNA Mrs. McGarry , we know what I am talking about . Not fame . I am talking about the other kind , the kind you will not find in here . ( She flips open the cover and a few leaves of the British Who 's Who . ) MARY Oh , the divorces and things like that . ANNA The scandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can take it . We are to be next-door neighbours for  --  one , two , three , at least three months . I want you to feel free to speak of the McKenzie girl . Naturally I hope we find other things to talk about , hundreds of other things , but please do not feel that we must all pretend that the McKenzie affair never happened . When I was a girl in Austria I had an uncle who did away with himself , committed suicide . We never spoke of Uncle Karl , but it would have been better if we had . So much secretiveness , you know ? If some-one outside our family accidentally said the word suicide he would be embarrassed and we would be embarrassed . We pretended Uncle Karl never lived , and we pretended nobody ever committed suicide . It was constantly a strain on ourselves and on our friends . So  --  please do n't pretend that the McKenzie thing did n't happen . p. 40 MARY Truly , Mrs. Douglas , I have n't the faintest idea what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you have out the British Who 's Who ? To look us up , surely . MARY Yes , that 's true . ANNA I see over there a pile of newspapers . I recognize them . They are all the New York papers , the morning papers , the evening papers . MARY Yes , my husband reads them every day , all of them . ANNA Then you know about the McKenzie affair , so why pretend not to know ? MARY Oh , now I see . Well , whatever the McKenzie affair is , I do n't know about it because I read practically nothing in the papers . I skim over the first page and I look inside to see if any of my friends have died , or their children are getting married , and that 's about all . If the newspapers depended on me they 'd go out of business . But now you 've aroused my curiosity . Is it all right for me to ask what was the McKenzie affair ? ANNA Two years ago in London a young Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farewell letters to one person . My husband . MARY ( nods ) I remember seeing something about it . But of course not knowing any of the people involved , and not being interested in theatrical people , it did n't leave much of an impression . Besides , anyone can leave letters , ca n't they ? p. 41 ANNA Anyone can leave letters . MARY And actors , prominent actors , young girls are always falling in love with them . That 's always been true . ANNA You do n't remember this case very well , or you 're being utterly polite . MARY I honestly do n't remember it well at all . A prominent English actor  --  I did n't even remember your husband 's name . And a girl drowning herself . ANNA Believe me , it gives me no great pleasure to talk about it , but your friends here in Midhampton , I 'm sure many of them will remember it , so better you should hear it from me . MARY Yes , I suppose so . ANNA The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a small part in a play with my husband , what is called a walk-on , which means what it sounds . She played a nurse . She walked on , and walked off . But she was determined . She was thorough . Every day for a year before she got the part she would literally haunt the Ivy . That is a restaurant in London , one of the favourite places for actors and actresses . She would literally haunt the place till she wangled an introduction to Archie . Strange to say , I met her too . She hated me , but I am used to that . Then strange to say she was given this tiny part , this walk-on , and she and Archie were thrown together , during rehearsals , during the run of the play . That was not enough . She telephoned us night and day . p. 42 MARY I should think you could have put a stop to that . ANNA She had no pride . She would ring me up and tell me I was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've heard of those . It happens to doctors ' wives . ANNA But surely not to you , Mrs. McGarry . MARY ( overlooking the gaffe ) No , not to me . Other doctors ' wives . But I do n't mean to interrupt . ANNA Not at all , but to continue . I said nothing to Archie about the telephone calls . The girl would have been discharged . But that was my big mistake . She should have been stopped early . MARY Maybe she would n't have stopped . Maybe having her discharged would have made matters worse . ANNA How could matters have been made worse ? She threw herself into the Thames . MARY ( nods , remembering more of the case ) Now I begin to remember more . Your husband  --  something about  --   --  ANNA Yes . She wrote him a note , asking him to meet her at a certain place on the Embankment , not far from our house in Chelsea . He foolishly went there and was recognized by the police . She was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned . And planned so because she hated me. p. 43 MARY Do n't you think she wanted to incriminate your husband , because he would n't have anything to do with her ? ANNA It was to destroy me . To make me think there had been an affair , a romance . MARY I do n't quite see that , Mrs. Douglas . How do you mean ? ANNA She could not incriminate him , Mrs. McGarry . He was nowhere near her when she threw herself in the Thames , but she planned it to have him dragged into the scandal . MARY Yes , I see that much . ANNA Hoping I would think there had been an affair , the rest of my life thinking there had been an affair . MARY Well , of course you knew the girl . I would have said merely that she was the victim of unrequited love , and wanted to incriminate your husband . ANNA No , it was not so simple . It was aimed at me . MARY I see . ( Although she does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very  --   --  ANNA All mixed up . Utterly . MARY Mm-humm . ANNA ( Studying MARY ) And then underneath it all , underneath all that I have told you . Do you see the deepest motive ? p. 44 MARY No . ANNA There was a deeper motive . Some time I will tell you . But at least now you know , if your friends ask what kind of person I am , this new neighbour , you will know why they are asking . My husband and I were the people you read about in the scandal sheets . MARY Oh , well , one consolation . With things the way they are in the world today , people 's memories are very short . ANNA In our world they are very long . DOUGLAS comes in off the terrace , trying with a quick look to guess at the turn the conversation has taken . ARCHIE ( to ANNA ) What do you think , old girl ? We 've all had a tiring day , at least we three , and I imagine Dr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCGARRY ( wheeling in from terrace ) No , I 'll be up for at least two hours . MARY The Yankees are playing the Red Sox tonight . Sometimes you 'll see the light on here till midnight . I 'll be in bed , but if you feel like coming over for a nightcap , Dr. McGarry 'll still be up . ARCHIE I thought everyone was for the Giants or the Dodgers . Zita , which is it you 're for ? p. 45 ZITA Oh , this year the Giants , although they do n't seem to be doing very well . They 've lost four straight . MCGARRY Do n't give up on any team that has Stanky . You can have Durocher , but Stanky 's my man . ANNA ( to MARY ) Do you understand this talk , Mrs. McGarry ? MARY Yes , I 'm afraid I do . If you 've lived with it for sixteen years . ARCHIE ( to ANNA ) Yes , and now that I 'm being naturalized , I think I 'll take it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the slightest attention to cricket . ARCHIE True , you did n't . Well , are we off ? ANNA Good night , and thank you so much , Mrs. McGarry . Doctor McGarry . ZITA Good night , and thank you ever so much . ARCHIE Mrs. McGarry . Doctor . MARY If there 's anything you need tonight MCGARRY Yes , I wo n't be going to bed before eleven-fifteen . I 'll listen to the ball game and the eleven o'clock news . And I 'll speak to the telephone company . ( To DOUGLAS ) You can probably have a connection by Friday at the latest . Meanwhile use ours any time . p. 46 ARCHIE Thank you again , for everything . Good night . We go out this way ? ( Meaning the french window and over the dune . ) MCGARRY Oh , sure . It 's much more convenient . They leave . MARY Would you like a drink ? MCGARRY No thanks . Reducing . MARY Well , I 'm not reducing , and I can stand a drink I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you warn me about their scandal ? MCGARRY Oh , the Scotch girl and Douglas ? I do n't know . Why did n't I ? Did you make a faux pas ? MARY No , but she would n't believe I did n't know anything about it . She told me the whole story . Or a whole story . A whole story out of whole cloth , it seemed to me . What was the story ? MCGARRY Oh , he was sleeping with some Scotch girl and she knocked herself off . Drowned herself . She left a lot of letters and it got into the papers . Things have been tough for him ever since . MARY I would n't be surprised if things had been tough for him before that . p. 47 MCGARRY Well , he may have asked for it . The young girl is nice . MARY She 's sweet . She seems to have a crush on a boy at Williams . We can have a small beach party for her when more of the school crowd start arriving . MCGARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own age , the better for all concerned . MARY What 's behind that remark ? Just a few minutes with Mrs. Douglas and I see double meanings in everything . MCGARRY Just that Zita thinks Douglas is God , and you saw them making passes at each other this afternoon . He snaps on the radio . He looks at his wrist watch as the radio warms up . A radio voice : " This is WINS , New York . " McGARRY fills his pipe and is lighting it , she is sipping her drink , studying him . McGARRY : " Right on the nose . " A radio voice : " Hi there , everybody , this is Mel Allen . " McGARRY : " Right on the nose . " MARY goes to him and kisses his nose as the curtain descends , with McGARRY smoking his pipe , beginning to get intent on the ball game , and MARY seats herself on a hassock and stares straight ahead , which in this case is in the direction of the DOUGLAS house. @x Evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DOUGLAS house . Porch furniture . The situation is now reversed : upstage is the windowed wall of the house but exterior , as distinguished from the previous scenes , which were interior and , from the audience point of view , facing out on the ocean . Now the audience is , as it were , looking inward from the ocean . At rise ARCHIE , in black tie , is helping himself to a drink from a portable bar . Before seating himself he waves his hand , facing offstage toward Right . ARCHIE Hello , there . A woman 's voice , MARY McGARRY 'S , calls from offstage , but her words can not be understood . He holds his hand to his ear . ARCHIE Ca n't hear you . MARY Never mind . See you in a little while . ARCHIE Come over any time . Do n't wait till eight o'clock . MARY We may do that . ARCHIE Righto . He sits in a camp chair and stretches his legs as ANNA enters from the house , sneaks a look toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is carrying paper cocktail napkins and as she speaks is busying herself with little preparations for her coming guests . She is beautifully dressed in a summer evening something . p. 49 ANNA You fool . I do n't want them to come over now . I have too many things to do . ARCHIE Well , she might help you . She 's good at that sort of thing . ANNA I see I can expect no help from you . ARCHIE What the devil do you want me to do ? I 'll be only too happy to spread the caviare or put the toothpicks in the sausages . Just tell me what to do and I 'll do it . ANNA Spread out those chairs . I do n't want everybody sitting in one little circle . He rearranges chairs . ARCHIE There we are . Two little circles ! How many people are coming ? ( Resumes his seat . ) ANNA I am not certain . Those two next door . ARCHIE Naturally . ANNA Yes , quite . Naturally . We could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGarry . ARCHIE You make it sound as though they 'd been spending all their waking hours in this house . He 's only been here once , and it seems to me that every time she 's been here she 's been very useful , very helpful . ANNA Nevertheless we would not dream of having people in without them , would we ? p. 50 ARCHIE I do n't see why not . ANNA All he does all day long is sit in that dreadful chair and stare over here . At night too . He knows when we turn out our lights  --  he knows when we get up in the morning . He knows when I am in my bath . ARCHIE How can he ? The bathroom 's on the other side of the house . ANNA They will not fit in with these people tonight . ARCHIE Then why did you ask them ? They have their friends , just as we have ours . ANNA Because they would sit there and stare at us and our guests . ARCHIE I do n't believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are determined to come to their defence without knowing any of the facts . If I tell you I can feel them staring at me you will refuse to understand that . ARCHIE No , but I 'll refuse to believe it . ANNA And so I 'd rather have them here , in this house , than to feel that they are spying on me . Well , perhaps they will go home early when they see how much out of place they are . ARCHIE ( humorously ) But if they go home early  --  according to you  --  they 'll just sit and stare at us . You surely do n't want that . p. 51 ANNA I fail to see anything comical . Remember , please , this party has a purpose . Henry Countryman has not signed anyone for that play . Alfred and Lynn turned it down . Freddie and Florence turned it down . Rex and Lilli turned it down , but all for good reasons . ARCHIE Yes , because it 's a bad play , more than likely . ANNA It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the author . ARCHIE Antonio Bellini . ANNA Bellini . You watch . I read his last play . ARCHIE Ponte Vecchio . ANNA ( sarcastically ) Thank you so much . Ponte Vecchio . Utterly beautiful . ARCHIE Utterly beautiful , but unproduced . ANNA Unproduced ? It was produced in Hartford , Connecticut . Harvard , Massachusetts . It was produced all over the map  --   --  ARCHIE But not in New York . ANNA It was not written for New York . It was not that kind of play . ARCHIE Look , old girl , you do n't really know what kind of play this new one is . ANNA ( after a pause ) For the tenth time , I have talked to people who have read it . I believe what they tell me . It is a great play , a great play . But even if it was a lousy play  --  I want Henry Countryman to put us in it . I will rely on Henry Countryman 's judgement , thank you . p. 52 ARCHIE So will I. ANNA Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Henry Countryman flop than a Joe Doakes success . ARCHIE No you would n't . ANNA There you are wrong . There is where you fail to see what this is all about . If we are together as a team in a Henry Countryman play , we are  --  established as a team . Henry Countryman means something . The first-string critics , publicity , other managers pleading with us , begging us to read manuscripts . Just because Henry Countryman has put us in a play . ARCHIE Oh , Lordy , I 'm not underestimating Henry Countryman . After all , I did work for him twenty years ago . But I still favour the direct approach . ANNA Oh , sure . Of course . You want to go to him and say , Henry old boy , I hear you have a play by this feller Bellini . Anna and I 'd like awfully to do it . Where did the English get such a reputation for diplomacy ? ARCHIE I sometimes wonder . ANNA I continually wonder . ARCHIE But if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Henry and his wife here , not a whole houseful of people . ANNA That would be fine . That would be utterly clever . We invite Henry and his wife to dinner , to drive all the way from East Hampton , or what-you-call-it , to have dinner with you and me ? In the first place , they would not come . p. 53 ARCHIE I do n't see why not . ANNA But I see why not . Henry would be suspicious . He would know we had a reason for asking him . He would know the reason , too . He would say to himself : Anna Root or Archie Douglas knows I have the Bellini play , and one of them wants to be in it . ARCHIE Very bright of him . Go on . ANNA And he would not come . But I know Henry and his wife . They adore parties . So I invited people they know , people they see on Long Island , and by so doing I see to it that Henry and his wife hear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped . It sounds like just a party . A good party , let us hope , but only a party . Then when they get here and they see us together , you and me , Henry thinks : Why not Anna and Archie for the Bellini play ? Nobody tells him the idea . He thinks the idea is his own . ARCHIE I dare say you 're right . But what if he does n't get the idea ? ANNA Then we do n't get the Bellini play . It 's the chance we take . A case of champagne , two pounds of caviare , an extra waitress  --  all wasted . We have spent five hundred dollars foolishly . ARCHIE Five hundred dollars ? ANNA More than five hundred dollars . How much do you think this dress cost ? p. 54 ARCHIE Well , at least you can wear it again . ANNA Not to any party where the Countrymans will be . ARCHIE Oh , what the hell , Anna . Henry knows I have n't been able to get a job . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully aware of that . But if Henry gets the idea that we would make a good team , like Alfred and Lynn , or Rex and Lilli People will say he 's a genius . ARCHIE And he 'll agree , old Henry . ANNA They will say : No one else would take a chance on Archie , but Henry Countryman did . He stares at her , deeply hurt . ANNA Well , it 's true , is n't it ? ARCHIE It 's true . And what do you get out of this ? ANNA Couples always work . Good acting couples always have good parts offered to them . ARCHIE You 've never lacked for good parts . ANNA We live together , we might as well act together . ZITA enters from the house , very pretty in evening dress . ZITA Sorry I 'm late . Can I help ? p. 55 ANNA There 's nothing for you to do now . ZITA Hello , Archie . ARCHIE Hello , Zita . I did n't realize you were coming to the party . ZITA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party with some of Next Door 's friends . What 's their name again ? ARCHIE McGarry . ANNA I did n't mean them . I meant your hostess . What 's her name ? ZITA Mrs. Eltringham . ANNA Am I expected to remember names like  --  what is it again ? ZITA Eltringham . They 're the nicest people here , with the exception of the McGarrys . ANNA In my humble opinion they 're nicer . They do n't live next door . ZITA Mother , what have you got against Dr. and Mrs. McGarry ? You 're always making little cracks . ANNA I do n't like feeling I am living in a goldfish bowl , their goldfish bowl . ZITA Oh , you 've said that before . They have a lot more important things to do than watch us . ANNA Then , these more important things , I wish they would do them . p. 56 ZITA Oh  --  pish tush . ANNA ( slapping ZITA 'S face ) I will have more respect . ZITA exits , not crying , not even coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . ANNA Is that the worst they ever see ? A mother punishing her disrespectful daughter ? ARCHIE I do n't know , Anna . It depends on how good their eyes are . ( Rising ) Do you want a drink ? ANNA I am perfectly calm . ARCHIE is pouring himself a drink when the first of their guests arrives . He is a well-dressed forty-fiftyish man , HAROLD KANE , an American artist , monetarily successful and within limits socially acceptable . He has his hand way out , goes straight to ANNA , takes her hand and kisses it . HAROLD Dear Anna . Was there anyone you wanted me to bring ? I tried to get you on the telephone , but Central simply refused to divulge your number . Hello , Archie . Tell me the truth , Anna . If I was supposed to bring someone I can be anywhere on the Island in ten minutes . ARCHIE Was that your car I heard ? HAROLD My spanking new Jaguar . p. 57 ANNA A new one ? You have a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAROLD That one 's a total wreck . A young friend of mine borrowed it and was taken in drink . ARCHIE Was he killed ? HAROLD Thrown clear . Not a scratch on him , the lucky little beast . ARCHIE Why do you buy these fast cars ? You do n't drive fast . HAROLD Oh , why do I do a lot of things ? I wish I knew . Or maybe I 'm better off not knowing . Anna , that 's new . ( Referring to the dress . ) ANNA Spanking new . Do you like it ? HAROLD It 's a mess , darling . ( To ARCHIE ) I 'll bet you would n't dare say that about it . ANNA Archie has n't said anything about it . HAROLD It 's sheer heaven , darling , and you know it . Come to think of it , it is quite sheer . Am I getting witty at this age ? ARCHIE You 're always witty . HAROLD I am , are n't I ? I wish I were British , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I envy the British , that and some of their uniforms . Years ago I always wanted to wear a mess jacket , but then Fred Waring 's orchestra started wearing them . Then I wanted to wear trews , but the college boys took them up , so I guess I 'm just as well off . Ai n't I ? p. 58 ARCHIE What will you have to drink ? HAROLD A Martooni , please . ARCHIE I beg your pardon ? HAROLD ( to ANNA ) He probably still calls them Marts . ARCHIE I 'll fool you . I call it Gin and French . HAROLD Well I do n't want a Gin and French . I want a Martooni , freezing cold , and without further delay , please . ( To ANNA ) All this array of beverages , you must be expecting a lot of people or a group of strangers . Why a group of strangers ? Because you do n't know what they 'll want to drink . So which is it ? ANNA A mixed group , not large , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . I may want to go home right this minute . ANNA ( looking at a small card ) Well , there 's you , and you were supposed to bring Pat Ardsley . I left word with your servant . HAROLD I know you did , but Pat and I are not speaking . She owes me over seven hundred dollars . ARCHIE Pat Ardsley ? She has more money than a maharaja . HAROLD I know that or I would n't tell on her . But she still owes me over seven hundred dollars . She lost to me at Canasta and then refused to pay . She said if I 'd lost it I would n't have paid her , which is a dirty lie . p. 59 ARCHIE Is it ? HAROLD It is , because I never conceivably would have lost to her . At anything . I would n't play her if I thought there was a chance of my losing . I practically live off women like her when I 'm not working . ARCHIE I can understand that . HAROLD Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anna ? ANNA Mabel and Henry Countryman . HAROLD Theatrical folk ? What for ? Do n't you see enough of them in the wintertime ? Or  --  ahh  --  you 're plotting something . Have they got a play you want to do ? ANNA That 's it . You guessed correctly . HAROLD Well , Henry ought to be in a good humour if that 's really why you asked him . He just made the National after all these years . ANNA What is the National ? ARCHIE It 's a golf club . HAROLD Oh , you know that , do you ? Well , do n't count on Henry to put you up if that 's why you 're having him . ARCHIE I 'm not a golfer . HAROLD Neither is Henry , really . And Mabel They 're seeing a lot of each other these days , Henry and Mabel . They 're very politically minded , vote and everything . I do n't know who they 're for , but I could find out if it 'd be any help to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in a play , or because Archie wants to join the National ? p. 60 ANNA Do you want to hear the rest of the list ? HAROLD Continue . ANNA Robertson and Alicia Thomas . HAROLD Oh , no ! Not with the Countrymans . ANNA Why not , please ? HAROLD Well , do n't you think it 's mixing them up a little too obviously ? Theatrical Countrymans , and the Old Guard Robertson Thomases . How did you ever get to know them ? ANNA I 've known them for years , so has Archie . HAROLD But not in this country . ANNA We 've visited them many times , in Hobe Sound and Westbury . HAROLD Oh , all right , do n't lay it on . You know them , and they 're coming . But I wish you 'd consult me when you 're planning these little do 's . I happen to know that in his quiet gentlemanly way it was Robertson Thomas that 's been keeping Henry Countryman out of the National . ANNA Hmm . But does Henry Countryman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't imagine he does . ANNA Then we have nothing to worry about . ARCHIE Nobody ever died of blackball poisoning . p. 61 HAROLD Now how would you know that , Archie ? ARCHIE I was blackballed myself , from a New York club . HAROLD So you were . Yes , I 'd forgotten . ARCHIE Oh , yes , I 'll bet you had . I 'll bet you even know who blackballed me . HAROLD I do . Who else , Anna ? Are there more ? ANNA The people next door . HAROLD Oh , come , come ! Those ? In that shack ? Who are they ? The garage-keeper or some such ? The others I can put up with , but deliver me from these village characters , or worse yet , some hearty Wall Street commuter from Cos Cob Conn . ARCHIE They 're very nice . HAROLD I did n't hear Anna say they were . ANNA They 're nothing like your description . He is a doctor , an invalid , and she 's  --  his wife . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my veins , and do n't you let Docky put a tourniquet on me . ARCHIE Have no fear . I 'll let you bleed to death . HAROLD ( as PAT ARDSLEY appears from Left ) Oh , hello , Hateful . I 'm not speaking to you . Here 's the person that wo n't pay her gambling debts . How 'd you get here ? I was supposed to call for you but I refused . p. 62 PAT ( a striking if somewhat used woman in her forties ) Hello , Anna dear . Dear Archie . ANNA He 's telling the truth . He was supposed to call for you . PAT I came with the Thomases . They 're here , coming around the other way . As the THOMASES appear : he is a rather distinguished man , sixty-five or so ; she is somewhat younger , chic , but no chicken . They appear from Right . ROBBIE THOMAS Good evening , Anna , Archie . ALICIA ( ARCHIE kissing her cheek ) Hello , dears . Now who was right ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She absolutely refused to come the same way we did . PAT I got here first . Is n't that the answer ? ROBBIE THOMAS Hello , Harold . ALICIA Oh , here 's Harold . Hello , Harold . HAROLD ( kisses ALICIA 'S cheek ) I was wondering if anyone was going to speak to me . PAT I often wonder why they do . HAROLD ( to ALICIA ) You know about this one , do n't you ? Does n't pay her gambling debts . p. 63 ROBBIE THOMAS ( not terribly amused ) Oh , now Now . PAT He 's going around saying the most awful things about me Any time anybody plays you for over a hundred dollars they 're only playing for fun . If you lost they 'd never get their money , so why pay you ? Would you pay him , Robbie ? ROBBIE THOMAS ( embarrassed ) Oh oh , leave me out of this . ARCHIE , throughout , is quietly asking for drink orders , gets them , goes to bar and is helped by HAROLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PAT . Here the COUNTRYMANS arrive from Right . He is a well-fed man in his late fifties . She is thin , dark , less pretty than the other women but as beautifully dressed . In this company she is on equal terms with ANNA , not with PAT and ALICIA . HENRY almost speaks first to the THOMASES but remembers in time to speak to his hostess and host . HENRY ( kisses ANNA 'S cheek ) Dear girl . ANNA Dear Henry . HENRY Old boy . ARCHIE Henry . ANNA Everybody knows everybody else . Good . p. 64 HAROLD So far , but there are more coming . ( He serves drinks to the THOMASES . ) PAT Hello , Henry . Hello , Mabel . MABEL Good evening , Pat . HENRY Pat , nice to see you . ANNA ( to ALICIA ) Did you have any trouble finding the place ? ALICIA Oh , heavens no . I 've been coming here all my life . I used to sail on the bay , in races . When I was a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful place for it . ANNA No , but Zita does . She adores it . They are interrupted by the arrival of MARY McGARRY , carrying TOM 'S chair , now folded . ANNA Oh , I should have sent Archie to get that . ALICIA ( warmly ) Mary , how nice ! MARY Hello , ' Licia . Hello , Robbie . ( She shakes hands with the THOMASES . ) Hello , Pat . ( She shakes hands with PAT . ) ANNA I do n't believe you know Mrs. Countryman ? Mr. Countryman ? Mrs. McGarry . And this is Harold Kane . You seem to know everyone else . p. 65 MARY Oh , yes . Old friends . ANNA And what about Dr. McGarry ? MARY He 's coming up the side steps . He 'll make it all right . It just takes him a little longer than most . The wheel chair would sink down in the sand , so I brought it . She starts to unfold it , with some help from ROBBIE , and during this operation TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow but he stands long enough to say good evening to ANNA , then sits in the chair . ALICIA Tom , how nice to see you after all these years . ROBBIE THOMAS Hello , Tom . Good to see you . MCGARRY ' Licia . Robbie . Hello , Pat . PAT Hello , Tom . ANNA Mabel , this is Dr. McGarry , Mrs. Countryman . And Mr. Countryman , Dr. McGarry . And Mr. Kane . ANNA and the COUNTRYMANS and HAROLD are subtly impressed by the McGARRYS ' friendliness with the THOMASES and PAT . MARY ( to ANNA ) This is awfully nice . We have n't seen the Thomases for two years , it must be . ALICIA And whose fault is that ? Every summer we try , you  --  p. 66 MCGARRY It 's my fault , but it really is a nuisance , getting this vehicle in and out of cars . Not to mention getting me in and out of cars . ALICIA ( goodnaturedly ) Well , we could come to you , if you 'd invite us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail together . I started to tell you ? ANNA Oh , yes . Just before Mrs. McGarry arrived . Mrs. Thomas was telling me . ARCHIE ( to MARY ) What can I get you to drink ? MARY Oh  --  a Martini ? ARCHIE Right . Tom ? ( He does not speak to MARY by her first name . ) MCGARRY Scotch whisky please . Tall , plain water . Two groups begin to form : in one are TOM , HENRY COUNTRYMAN , PAT ARDSLEY , and ARCHIE . In the other are MARY , MABEL COUNTRYMAN , HAROLD , ROBBIE , ALICIA , and ANNA . MCGARRY Are you down for the week-end , Mr. Countryman ? HENRY No , we have a little place near Water Mill . MCGARRY Oh , did you buy ? p. 67 HENRY Yes , we bought the Stanley Rockwell place . Do you know it ? MCGARRY Yes . It 's a beautiful place . Were you badly damaged in the ' 44 hurricane ? HENRY We did n't own the place then , but I understand it stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes . Yes indeed . Very much so . I had to sit it out , right in that house next door . Right in one of these chairs . It was quite an experience for my wife and me . HENRY It must have been . MCGARRY In fact I thought about writing a play about it and sending it to you . HENRY I wish you had . Maybe you still can . MCGARRY No , I found out that I was n't cut out to be a writer . HENRY You do n't know till you 've tried . MCGARRY I 've tried . ARCHIE It 's an interesting situation , I must say , Tom . You had to stay in your chair , and Mary stayed with you ? MCGARRY Yes , and could have gone inland . But she stayed . As a matter of fact , we sat through the ' 38 one too . ARCHIE I say , how often do you get them here ? p. 68 MCGARRY Well , there was the ' 38 one . That was worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . A few miles down the beach . ARCHIE Thirty-eight , then ' 44 . Six years . Did you have one last year ? MCGARRY No . Not here . ARCHIE Will there be one this year ? MCGARRY I 'll let you know in September . ARCHIE Please do , in advance , if possible . PAT Yes , let us all know , there 's a dear friendly soul . I could close up my house , Mr. and Mrs. Countryman could close theirs , the Douglases theirs . MCGARRY And Mary and I could just sit here while the wind blows us into the bay . PAT But you 're used to it . I was down for the ' 38 one and I never want to witness another , thank you . ARCHIE I should think they 'd be very exciting . Dramatic . I 've never been in a really bad one , on land . That was a rather good blow in when was it , Henry ? When we crossed in the Mauretania ? HENRY The winter of ' 30- ' 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people with broken arms and legs . Do you remember how the piano skittered across the grand salon and smashed to bits ? p. 69 HENRY I do indeed . I 'd bet over a thousand dollars in the ship 's pool , and I lost , needless to say . ARCHIE Yes , I remember that . You 'd bid over a thousand dollars , but I ca n't honestly say I felt awfully sorry for you . Two hits in New York and one in London , that year . HENRY But that was ' 30- ' 31 . MCGARRY But you 've had your share of hits since then . What are your plans for next season , Mr. Countryman ? HENRY Nothing definitely set . I have one play by an unknown , or practically unknown , but so many things can happen between now and the fall . MCGARRY That was a good year in ' 30- ' 31 , as Archie says . I saw both of them . The Wondrous Heart , and Our World Is Young . What was the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young ? Nancy  --  Nancy  --  Nancy Peary , was n't that it ? HENRY Nancy Peary is right . Quit the theatre to marry an army officer in India . I saw her in London two years ago . Did you know her ? MCGARRY No , just fell in love with her for about two weeks . HENRY But you are interested in the theatre . MCGARRY I used to go a lot , and I still read plays when they 're published , and I keep up with theatrical news . The only stars I ever met are Anna and Archie . I knew a few chorus girls , but we wo n't speak about that . p. 70 PAT Speak about it , go on , Tom . You know you 'd love to . MCGARRY I 'll tell you about two of them . One of them stood me up at the clock at the Biltmore and me trying to show off in front of some friends of mine . And the other wanted to drive to Connecticut and get married the first night I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAT And what about in between ? MCGARRY They 're the ones we do n't talk about . No , till Archie and Anna moved here I never really knew any important theatrical people . And I guess I 'll never see them unless they go on television . HENRY ( politely ) What about you , Archie ? What are your plans ? ARCHIE Well , I 've read one or two things but I have n't come across anything I really liked . Maybe it 's time I jolly well did something and stopped being so choosy or they 'll be forgetting me , but do n't you think I 'm right in waiting ? HENRY That 's always my advice . If the part is n't for you , do n't take it . A chap we both know took a play a couple of years ago just as a stop-gap , a fill-in , and it was a flop . But  --  while he was in the flop someone else got a part that our friend was ideally suited to . p. 71 ARCHIE Hilary ? HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't tell you the play , but the manager wanted Hilary Todd , but Hilary was working , so he missed out . Oh , wait for the right part , by all means . ( To TOM ) You still read plays , you say , Doctor ? MCGARRY Most of those that are published in book form . HENRY Do you ever read books on how to write plays ? MCGARRY No , I ca n't say I do . HENRY How about books of criticism ? MCGARRY No , not them either . I 'm satisfied with my own opinions . I read the plays , and I read what the critics say about them the next day , but not criticism in book form . HENRY Good . MCGARRY Good ? Why ? HENRY Well , I have a play that I 'd like to have an opinion on . And I 'd like it to be a fresh opinion , non-professional . I do n't want an actor 's opinion , or another playwright 's , or another manager 's . If I sent this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? You 'd be doing me an enormous favour . MCGARRY Hell , you 'd be doing me the favour . p. 72 HENRY No , not if you 'd sit down and talk to me about it after you finished reading it . MCGARRY ( humorously ) You can be sure I 'll sit down . HENRY ( embarrassed ) Well  --  you know . MCGARRY Sure . Why I 'd be delighted . HENRY ( calling to MABEL in the other group ) Dear ? I 've found the man to read the play . MABEL Yes , dear ? HENRY Dr. McGarry 's kindly consented to read the play . Attention  --  particularly lighting attention  --  is now focused on the other group . MABEL Wonderful ! But are you sure you did n't bludgeon him into it ? MARY Not Tom . He loves to read plays . Is this a play that Mr. Countryman 's written , or someone else ? MABEL ( controlling her hauteur ) Not one that he 's written . ( To ANNA ) I 'd hate to read a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Back to Mary ) No , Mrs. McGarry , this is a play that was written by  --  a foreigner , a European . Henry 's terribly keen about it , but at the same time has certain misgivings about it I hate to be so vague , I wish I could tell you the name of the author , and the characters and plot and all about it , but Anna understands this kind of vagueness. p. 73 ANNA Utterly . MABEL I am free to say this much : I think it 's a fine play , but I agree with Henry : we 've been wanting a fresh , outside opinion on it , from somebody that 's outside the theatre , you know ? Henry 's had his eye out for someone like that , oh , for months . How lucky for him that he met your husband . I wonder why  --  that is ( confused )  --   --  MARY Why he picked my husband ? I 'll bet I know why . Tom used to be very fond of the theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time , uh , revealing himself as a  --  someone who loved the theatre . MABEL But as an amateur . I know Henry does n't want it read by a professional . Anna understands that . HAROLD So do I. It 's simply this : The theatre 's full of people that do n't trust each other  --  and rightly so . I know thousands , literally thousands of the creatures , and I would n't trust a single one of them . That goes for you , dear Anna , and you , Mabel , and Henry , and Archie , and all of you . Completely untrust-worthy  --  ROBBIE THOMAS Now Now . ANNA But he 's right , Robbie , and Mabel is right , and Henry . It has nothing to do with our morals  --  p. 74 HAROLD It has , too . ANNA Not the kind of morals you are thinking of , Harold . ROBBIE THOMAS Principles . Ethics ? That right ? ANNA Yes . It 's just that there is so much competition in the theatre that our , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALICIA I think that 's very well put . It fits in with everything you and Archie have told us about theatrical people . ROBBIE THOMAS Yuss . Yuss . That 's true . But still I think Harold was a bit rough on them . MARY Well  --  will I be allowed to read the play ? MABEL Frankly , I doubt it , Mrs. McGARRY . If I know Henry 's methods , he 'll extract a promise from your husband not to show it to anyone . In fact especially you , because Henry will want only your husband 's opinion , uninfluenced by anyone else 's . ALICIA Well , if that 's the case , Mabel , do n't ever show a play to Robbie . I 'd find a way to read it . And Mary will too , no matter what Henry says , or Tom . MARY No , there you 're wrong , ' Licia . To be absolutely frank about it , I do n't want to read the play . I do n't read much but children 's books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page to where somebody says something . You know : Mary : ( gesture ) then you have to go from where it says Mary , to where what she says begins . The dialogue . Then : Tom : ( gesture ) and what Tom says . Then Mary , then Tom . Something like watching a tennis match , only worse on the eyes . p. 75 MABEL ( superiorly , with a smile ) Hmm . ANNA One gets used to it . MABEL Are you reading one now , Anna ? ANNA I 've read one or two things but I have n't come across anything I really liked for next season . If we found the right play Archie and I might do one together . ALICIA How exciting , Anna ! You 've never done one together . ROBBIE THOMAS That would be great . You two . ANNA Do you think so , Robbie ? I 'm so glad you like the idea . ( To MARY ) Archie and I never have acted in the same play But ( a general statement ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old standbys , not for our first co-starring , and we have n't seen any-thing we like . It would have to be modern and new , new like us as a team . Everything new . ( She starts to act . ) Oh , what fun it could be ! Archie Douglas and Anna Root in the new play by John Jones  --   --  HAROLD Not James Jones , surely . ANNA ( ignoring him )  --  lovely new costumes , new sets . ALICIA It would be lovely , Anna . Lovely . p. 76 ROBBIE THOMAS No question . No question . ALICIA So gay . Would n't you love to see it , Mary ? MARY ( seriously , well consideredly ) I think it 'd be wonderful . ANNA But first !  --  find the play . ROSE ( the cook ) Dinner is served , ma'am . ANNA Thank you , Rose . Shall we go in ? ARCHIE gets behind TOM 'S chair and starts to push , and the others , except HAROLD , follow in various kinds of silences : MABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good mood , MARY for the first time seeing that ANNA needs to do this play , PAT disinterested . HAROLD lingers until he and ANNA alone remain on the terrace . HAROLD You are as subtle as a ton of brick . ANNA Then help me , you bastard . Be funny . This is no joke to Archie and me . HAROLD ( seriously ) I know , darling . CURTAIN p. 77 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO The DOUGLAS terrace . A very few hours later . The ladies and gentlemen are seated in a crescent-shaped group , as though looking out on the ocean . They are seated as follows , from Stage Right to Stage Left : TOM McGARRY , MARY McGARRY , PAT ARDSLEY , ROBBIE THOMAS , MABEL COUNTRYMAN , ARCHIE DOUGLAS , HAROLD KANE , HENRY COUNTRYMAN , ALICIA THOMAS , ANNA ROOT . ALICIA Oh , come on , Robbie . Tell it . ROBBIE THOMAS ( leaning rather far back , with cigar ) But why me ? Countryman , Henry , you saw money spent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not our fellows . Not Americans . ROBBIE THOMAS That 's true . You are still an American . Well , sir . ALICIA ( to all the others ) This is real money . Not maharaja money . ROBBIE THOMAS ( pontificating , looking way out ) Well , sir . There was the time in Pum Beach . Liciar and I were in San Jean de Luz  --   --  ALICIA Juan les Pins . ROBBIE THOMAS ( really going over her interruption ) Staying at friends of ours . This cablegram . Man I did n't really know , I really did n't know him very well . " It is So and So 's Buthday , " he said . " You and Alicia are absolutely indispensable . " So by the Lord Harry he arranged for Aliciar and me to take ship from Naples . Naples , was n't it , Alicia ? p. 78 ALICIA Naples . ROBBIE THOMAS New York . And a train from New York to Pum Beach . ALICIA But that was n't the  --   --  ROBBIE THOMAS Oh . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in Philadelphia . PAT Not my coming-out party . ALICIA No , not yours , dear . This was some years later . ROBBIE THOMAS When they took the Bellevue . Oh , that . They gave us a car from Locust Valley . Oh , I remember that one all right . Yes , yes , Alicia . We were living quite a ways from Locust Valley , but they sent us our instructions , we were to be at Locust Valley at such-and-such a time and board the car . I must say nothing bored me more than the ideer of driving over to Locust Valley and boarding a car , so I said to Alicia , remember ? Have the damned thing stopped somewhere along the way and we 'll get on there . But not Locust Valley . The aeroplane party for the circumcision in Cleveland , but I do n't like to fly . I refuse to fly . ALICIA ( the understanding wife ) Yes . Well , Anna , dear . We must be off . ANNA Please do n't . ROBBIE THOMAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon have another brandy . p. 79 ALICIA We enjoyed every second . Robbie and I have n't had such a good time  --   --  ROBBIE THOMAS I do n't see any reason to leave now , just when the party 's going so well . Archie , are n't you a golfer ? Tom ? Oh , I beg your pardon . But you and I ought to play ( Implying age and handicap . ) MCGARRY Not till they invent some motor for this . PAT ( rising ) Thank you , Anna . I 've had a really lovely time . I really have . HAROLD ( rising ) Pat 's going home with me . We made it up . HENRY I think we ought to be going , too . MABEL I know we simply must . Are you all going to the Powells ' tomorrow ? ANNA We 're not . MARY No . PAT I am , but only for a minute . ALICIA I thought we might go there . ROBBIE THOMAS Is that Dirty Powell , old Dirty ? Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . This is Walter Powell , we went there the Sunday before last . p. 80 ROBBIE THOMAS ( rising and struggling to keep his feet ) If that 's the fellow , I for one am never going again . Good night , Countryman . Good night , Melba . Anna , give me a kiss , you attractive thing . Archie , old boy . Mary , you do n't give out kisses . Good night , Tom . Good night , Kane . Is there anyone I did n't say good night to ? MABEL Good night , Mr. Thomas . ROBBIE THOMAS Good night , Melba . MABEL ( audibly ) Mabel . ROBBIE THOMAS I begya poddon . Did I call you Mabel ? Melba , dear girl . Countryman . Can we give anyone a lift ? HENRY If you change your mind about the Powells ' we may see you there . ROBBIE THOMAS Quite . ALICIA takes him by the arm and they and HAROLD and PAT and the COUNTRYMANS depart , leaving the McGARRYS with ANNA and ARCHIE . MCGARRY That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay a while . Let me get you something . MCGARRY Have you got a radio ? I do n't want  --   --  ARCHIE Oh , for the baseball ? No , we have n't . New York are playing Cincinnati , or Cincinnati are playing Chicago , which is it ? p. 81 MCGARRY I 'm a little tight . If you 'll give me a hand ? Mary , all set ? MARY I think I 'll stay a minute and have a cigarette with Anna . MCGARRY You will ? Okay . In that case , Archie , I could use a little help down the stairs . Mary can bring my coach later . ARCHIE I 'll bring the coach , too . Ladies ? In a little while . The men exit . ANNA ( after they have departed ) Nothing has happened right this night . The plans of this night I had so fixed , arranged . Countryman owns a play , written by an Italian young man . I believe this play to be excellent , great . I know the play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great young men who are fixed right away . I know this play . The other young men , going so far back to Coward , Odets . This is all new . I looked at this play . Mary McGarry , I spent five hundred dollars in bribery to read a copy of the play , Bellini 's play . Countryman owns the play and I paid five hundred dollars to bribe to see a copy of it , but Countryman asks , he asks your husband to read it . Mary , this play is life and death to us , Archie and I. Archie and me . Cognac , Mary ? MARY I 'll get it . ( She does so , two glasses. ) p. 82 ANNA The girl in London killed herself because of Archie . Consequently no one like Countryman will give Archie a job . Yes ! But they wo n't give me as good a job ! Every job I am offered is less and less . I should not like to tell you to whom I was asked to take second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Miss Root , this girl is a draw , a moving-picture reputation . " And do n't forget , this was not in my house . They do n't come to my house any more . I go to their offices . " Miss Root , this girl is a draw , a motion-picture reputation . " Out like this . Acting is all I am , my life . My body , my mind . I know every play , where to turn , what the author means , plays I could not act in . What could I do in Journey 's End ? But I know two parts in it . Me Hamlet ? But I know Hamlet . All-most-every line of Hamlet . Me Juliet ? But I know Juliet , in three languages . I know singing . Have you got a gramo-phone ? No ? Then you do not have my records . I was in Sixth Avenue three months ago and paid five dollars for a record I sang . Dancing ? Well  --  no . No . But I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside this little house , find a gold cigarette case with my name , A n n a , in diamonds . A prince gave it to me . He 's dead , too . Robbie told us about how he saw money spent . Oh-ho ! A private car ? I had a private train one time , and then did not take it . For one year , just for the fun of it , but for one year I did not touch money , not my fingers on money , one penny of money . Crazy stuff . One time my friend  --  not the gentleman who gave me the cigarette case . Another friend . I said : I am an actress , I want to remain famous . Very well , said he . So in London he paid a man to tell the press that I was looking at plays in New York , and in New York a press man said I was looking at plays in London . A season is very short , but no one knows  --  hardly any-one  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was in  --  a Mediterranean country . Then I fell in love with Archie , and then Archie fell in love with a little Scottish girl . In love with her ! If she had been in love with him , but no . He was in love with her . I guess Henry knows it , Henry Countryman . And Mabel , I dare-say she knows it . If they know it , Archie and I will never do that play . Henry and Mabel will know I was slipping that long ago . Yes , slipping . If Archie could fall in love with the little Scottish girl , then I was slipping . And nobody fell in love with me . Nobody fell in love with me. p. 83 MARY ( after a pause ) You 're still one of the most famous actresses in the world , Anna . Even I know that . ANNA ( patting MARY 'S head ) Sure . And Bernhardt . Bernhardt , with one leg , and dead . She 's famous , but what is she doing next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's who doing next season ? Yep , yep . Mary , New York are ahead , five to two in the top of the eighth . Or maybe it 's the bottom of the eighth . In any event , New York are ahead . And Brooklyn were rained out this after-noon . MARY I knew that . ARCHIE Ca n't seem to tell you anything , eh ? Well , old girl , I think it went over very well , do n't you ? Mary , did n't you think it was a good party ? ANNA Hardly the question to ask one of our guests . ARCHIE ( pouring a drink ) But Tom thought it was a good party . MARY He had a very good time . ARCHIE He had . He had . But not you ? Was it not a good party ? Were there little nuances that escaped me ? Some little bitternesses created ? Now I 'll tell you what was good about it . First off , it was a nice surprise all round that the McGarrys were old friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think in parties it 's always a good starter when you invite people , say separate people , and they turn out to know one another independently of the host and hostess . It makes for a warmth , an unexpected warmth . Then of course let me see now : well , Harold and Pat . An antagonism there , but not a genuine one . An old bag like Pat  --  I beg your pardon , Mary , but  --   --  p. 84 MARY I know Pat . ARCHIE And Harold . Let 's face it . Harold 's not going round bothering women in the dead of night , let 's put it that way . Suffice ? ANNA Suffice , if it means what I think it does . ARCHIE It does . So a little tiff between Pat and Harold , that is n't going to spoil anyone 's dinner , and notice they did go home together . ANNA That rather spoils my dinner , an attractive woman like Pat . MARY Yes , I 'm inclined to agree with you . ARCHIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the McGarrys  --  oh , yes , and the Countrymans . I think Henry and Mabel had a good time , do n't you ? MARY I do n't honestly know . I know Robbie Thomas did , though . ARCHIE Robbie did get rather tiddly , did n't he ? MARY He was feeling no pain . He 's nice , though . And it 's only when he feels relaxed , among friends , that he ever shows that side of him . But you know that as well as I do . ANNA Yessss . Robbie had a good time . MARY If it 's the eighth inning I 'd better go home . Tom 'll want his glass of milk pretty soon . Anna , thank you , thank you ever so much . And good night , Archie . Good night . She exits , and ARCHIE seats himself , legs outstretched , drink in hand and hand almost on the floor . p. 85 ARCHIE Well ? ANNA Need you ask ? ARCHIE I was n't sure . We do n't get the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're quite sure of that . Was anything said ? ANNA No , at least if you mean did Henry say to me , Anna , you and Archie do not get the play . No , that was not said . ARCHIE Are you feeling a chill ? Shall I get you something ? ANNA No , thank you . ARCHIE So  --  we do n't get the play . It is n't the last chance , you know . ANNA ( languidly ) No ? ARCHIE No , it is n't . There may be some little fellow tap-tap-tapping away this very second , over at the Martha 's Vineyard , you know , writing the ideal play for us . ANNA The Martha 's Vineyard . What 's that ? ARCHIE Kit and Guthrie . ANNA Oh , yes . Some little man tapping away , for us ? ARCHIE You 're right . It 's a slim chance . How much money 've we got ? ANNA In this country ? You mean my money and your money together ? p. 86 ARCHIE Yes . ANNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . ARCHIE Well , that 's not so bad . I can  --   --  ANNA Excuse me . I left out Zita . Four thousand dollars for Zita , minimum . That 's without Christmas , and other expenses not in her allowance . ARCHIE Six thousand dollars , more than likely . ANNA More than likely . ARCHIE I never knew we were that well off  --  till we no longer had it . ANNA I 'll take care of Zita . I have a ring that will see her through . ARCHIE I know you have . A ring , a couple of rings , a necklace , two or three bracelets . But I wo n't permit it . ANNA ( sardonic laugh ) Then without your permission , kind sir . ARCHIE I think I 'll motor up to New York tomorrow and see about a job on television . ANNA Do you ? ARCHIE Are you doubting my word ? ANNA Are they waiting for you ? Tomorrow is Sunday , those executive accounts  --   --  p. 87 ARCHIE Account executives . ANNA  --  are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay ? The St. Regis ? ARCHIE I thought I might . ANNA Lunch at 21 ? Sign the chit , thirty-five dollars . Telephone me here you are terribly tied up Monday night , ca n't get back . El Morocco , sign the chit , one hundred dollars . Car with chauffeur Monday night , forty dollars . A few neckties and things , fifty dollars . A present for me , one hundred dollars ? Stay here , Archie . We wasted five hundred dollars tonight . ARCHIE This party cost five hundred dollars ? ANNA With my dress , more than that . I told you it would . ( She laughs bitterly . ) ARCHIE What 's rocking you with laughter ? ANNA When I bought this dress I was extravagant because I could n't wear it again in front of Mabel Countryman . Mabel did n't even ask us to dinner next week  --  but she did ask Robbie and Alicia . ARCHIE ( very bitterly ) What shall I do ? Give up smoking ? I offered to go up to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? I do n't know what you shall do . Stand outside the Colony restaurant and be rude to the autograph morons . Take out the American citizen papers and have two dinner jackets from London . Make jokes about Ronnie Colman selling beer . p. 88 ARCHIE I have nothing against Ronnie . ANNA Wait till he reads that interview , he 'll have something against you . ARCHIE I wo n't be pushed around by those bubble-gum morons at the Colony restaurant . And as to the dinner jackets , they 're deductible from the income tax . ANNA Yes , but what income ? ARCHIE ( after a pause ) My dear girl , you 're not coming out with it , are you ? You 're not coming out with the fundamental complaint , are you ? ANNA No . I ca n't even act any more . Harold Kane told me that . ARCHIE ( continuing ) You wo n't permit yourself to complain against the Scottish girl . Is it because you think you 're behaving as a lady ought to behave ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a lady . ANNA I said I ca n't even act any more . ARCHIE And  --  you never could . ANNA ( very deliberately ) On-stage , or off-stage ? Which performance do you object to , Archie ? On-stage , or off-stage ? ( She looks at him contemptuously , rises , walks as though to the portable bar , but passes behind his chair and enters the house , leaving him alone and somewhat amazed. ) p. 89 ARCHIE ( helping himself to a drink ) Oh , well . As he pours the drink ZITA appears from Left , carrying her shoes , which she puts on one of the porch tables . She goes to ARCHIE and places a hand on each shoulder . ZITA Do n't start hitting it up again , please , Archie . ARCHIE ( smiling , glass in mid-air ) The jeunesse dore , for God 's sake . ZITA Please . ARCHIE ( Cockney ) Go ' ome and tell your mother she wants ya . ZITA ( indicating ANNA with a head-shake ) This is the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist watch ) Why are you home so early ? Most daddies ask why you 're home so late , but I want to know why you 're home so early . ZITA It 's not early . ARCHIE It 's early for you and your crowd , a Saturday-night dance . Do you want something ? ( He is not tight , but is shaken by the scene with ANNA . ) ZITA Ginger ale . I 'll get it . p. 90 ARCHIE Sit down . Here . ( He wipes beach chair with his handkerchief . ) Expensive hankie , not yet paid for by yours truly . Why are you home so early ? ZITA It was a lousy party , really . ARCHIE At your age the only reason a party can be lousy is you had a spat with your boy friend  --  or he was n't there . ZITA He was n't there . ARCHIE Is that a remark full of meaning , Zita ? Am I still your one and only true boy friend ? ZITA Yes . ARCHIE Well  --  the sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you eavesdropping for that part of it ? ZITA No , or I guess not . ARCHIE I ca n't afford you . You cost too much . ZITA I do n't know what you mean , but it does n't make sense to me . I do n't cost you anything . The few kisses we have . They do n't cost you anything . Once in a while a kiss . A hand-hold , but never a genuine embrace , our hearts entwined . ARCHIE Are you tight ? ZITA I sound like it . No , I 'm just so damn tired . I 've been up since six o'clock this morning , do n't forget that . I played ten sets of tennis and I swam three  --  no , four times . I 'm sleepy more than anything else , that 's why the brain is n't working too well , but I love you and this 'd be the perfect time for us to be able to go in and turn out the lights and  --  the works . What were you and Mum fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my inability to make any . How much did you hear ? ZITA Just the very end , where you told her she was n't an actress . I must say she put you in your place . ARCHIE Where is my place ? ZITA Oh , stop dramatizing . You got in a scandal and you ca n't get a job on account of it . If Mum 's annoyed she has every reason to be . I 'm sorry . I would n't talk this way if I were n't tired , but I am tired . And what good does it do me to come home tired , no father , and a mother that hates me ? A famous actor , handsome , but just a few kisses . I can tell you one more thing . I 'm sicker of my life than you are of yours . ARCHIE I did n't say anything about being sick of my life . ZITA But you are , or you ought to be . But you 're forty-eight years old , or near it . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my place . ARCHIE By whom ? ZITA By whom indeed . If you want to know the truth , I came home in a taxi . ARCHIE Because you thought you were snubbed ? ZITA This very attractive boy , or at least I thought he was very attractive  --  yes , he was attractive . He sat across from me at dinner , and I knew he was the one I liked best at the party , and liked me best too . Then we went to the dance and we danced together till somebody cut in . Up to then he 'd been very nice . Reasonable , you know , but when he cut back again , this time he was a sex-boat . I said to him , " Wait a minute , Big Wheel . This is still me , the same girl you were dancing with a minute ago . " " I want to talk to you , " he said , so I went out on the porch with him . " No , " he said . " The car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car with him . And then it started . I 've been in cars with boys before , but this boy was n't tight or anything , and he 'd been sweet and reasonable , before we were cut in on . Then I guess somebody said something to him and he got a different perspective . They must have said something about me , to make him change in two minutes . No  --  they did n't only say something about me . They said something about you and me , and Mum . I guess it reflects what they 're all saying about us , Archie . You and me , and Mum . p. 92 ARCHIE Saying what , Zita ? ZITA Do I have to draw a diagram ? They know you 're not my father . They know what happened in London . You remember the boy I used to go skiing with , from Rye ? His mother finally put a stop to us when she found out who he was going around with . But this boy tonight , I thought he was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a taxi , and I do n't think I 'll ever go to any of those dances again . I 'm sure I wo n't . God , just a few kisses , you and I. Just a few kisses , Archie . ( She rises and starts to go in , still walking slowly speaks ) I start the evening with a slap in the face , and I end it with a kick in the teeth . I never hurt anybody ! She goes off , inside the house , at Right , and ARCHIE sits in his chair with head in hands , momentarily looking at the floor . He raises his head slowly as ANNA , in neglige covered by quilted bathrobe , enters from Left and sits in a beach chair not too near but not far away from his . Her face is expressionless as the curtain slowly descends , and they are both staring straight ahead. @x Same as Act One . About two weeks later , afternoon . TOM is in his wheel chair , listening to the radio . RADIO VOICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's really coming down . Oh , if you thought what we had before was a rainstorm , this makes it look like a light sprinkle . It 's really coming down  --  MCGARRY ( sourly ) It always does . I never saw it go up . RADIO Now the ground crew are going out again to try and cover the field with tarpaulins . Let 's see how long it takes them this time . The last time was just a little over three minutes . But it 's really no use , friends . That field is soaked already , and I do n't think there 'll be any more baseball here today . Here in our broad-casting booth we can hardly see beyond third base , it 's raining so hard . MCGARRY It 's really coming down , eh ? RADIO Well , that 's gon na be all for today . I just got a signal from Plate Umpire Charley Berry . The game is called , baseball fans . And of course you all know , it is n't a legal game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inning . In case some of you baseball fans just tuned in , for you late-comers , this game was held up for forty-eight minutes in the second inning , then they tried to play some more baseball but the game was held up again in the top half of the third inning and again in the bottom half . And now in the bottom half of this game between the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians  --  no score , by the way  --  they 've decided to call it no contest . It 's really been raining here at the Yankee Stadium , as you New York fans know . It 's not an official game . Called in the second half of the third inning . This is the only afternoon game in the major leagues , by the way , so  --   --  p. 94 MCGARRY ( snaps off the radio ) So Dr. Thomas Desmond McGarry will settle down with a good book . CLAIBORNE ( entering from kitchen ) Game called on account of rain , Doctor . MCGARRY Thanks , Claiborne . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLAIBORNE Well , I got those eight Saturday Evening Posts with that continued story down in my room . I can get you that . You know , the ones you asked me to save . I 'm finished with it . The spy story ? MCGARRY All right , fine . CLAIBORNE Some iced tea ? MCGARRY Mm  --  later , thanks . CLAIBORNE When the gentleman comes from Water Mill ? MCGARRY Oh , Mr. Countryman . I do n't know when he 'll be here . He did n't set any definite time . CLAIBORNE exits and TOM dials a number on the telephone  --  three digits . MCGARRY Speak to Mrs. McGarry , please . Is n't this the Library ? Is n't this three-oh-seven ? Sorry . ( Dials again . ) Uh-oh , you 're the party I just spoke to , are n't you ? Sorry . ( Dials once . ) Operator , I 've been dialling three-oh-seven , but I 'm not getting the Library . Will you try it for me , please ? Hello , is this three-oh-seven ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recognizes her voice and she his . ) I 've been dialling three-oh-seven and getting three-oh-eight or some-thing . Listen , did Countryman set any definite time ? My recollection is that he did n't Good Good Oh , the God damn baseball game was rained out and I have nothing to do till he gets here . No , do n't come home . It 's going to rain here any minute and that 'll mean a lot of business for the Library . I 'll see you later . ( He hangs up , looks out of the window , toward Right and says aloud ) Oh , God . ( He sits , trying to look unconcerned until pretending to be surprised by ANNA 'S voice. ) p. 95 ANNA Are you busy ? May I come in ? MCGARRY Oh , hello , Mrs. Douglas . Come in . I have n't seen you since your lovely party . I 've seen you , but ANNA May I sit down ? MCGARRY Why of course . Have a cigarette . ANNA ( holding up case ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to smoke . The fact of the matter is , I 'm not feeling well . MCGARRY ( in a feeble attempt to be light ) Then you ought to see a doctor . ANNA You are very bitter , are n't you , Doctor ? MCGARRY No , I do n't think so . ANNA How is your painting ? MCGARRY I finished one picture since I saw you , two weeks ago . ANNA You work fast ? MCGARRY I did this one in two days . If I do n't finish them right away I never do . ANNA Impatient . You give up . MCGARRY I lose interest . I 'm not going to do any more till after my big exhibition . ANNA We received the invitation , thank you very much . p. 96 MCGARRY I was against the idea of sending out invitations , but if any-body pays good money for any of the pictures , the proceeds go to charity , and I 'm in favour of charity . Or I suppose I am . ANNA I think you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what am I going to do ? MCGARRY ( professionally stalling ) That 's a large question . ANNA When we first came here  --  I shall be quite frank  --  at first I somehow resented your sitting here in your house and being able to watch everything that happened in our household . You could watch our comings and goings from the moment we arrived here . That is a monstrous thing , I told myself , for a man to sit like God , or the devil , watching every move I make . I resented you very much , Dr. McGarry . MCGARRY I should think you would , if that 's the way you felt . ANNA It 's a strange thing for an actress to say , hating to be stared at . MCGARRY Not at all . Cornell , Garbo , Fontanne  --  they all insist on privacy when they 're not on stage , do n't they ? ANNA I lowered the blinds on your side of the house , I used that side of our house as little as possible . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I wo n't deny that I did watch you , but I did n't make a deliberate effort to spy on you . I sit where I always sit , I did n't move my chair to a better vantage point . In the mornings I sit out on the terrace to get the sun , then I have lunch , and in the afternoon I listen to my radio . As a matter of fact on good days , when the sun 's out and I have the radio out on the terrace , I 'm facing the other direction , to get the afternoon sun . So I could n't watch you unless I had eyes in the back of my head . Still , I understand what you mean . The houses are quite close together . ANNA But this feeling changed . Recently I began to hope you were watching me . Like God ( He nods , professionally , but says nothing . ) In fact , in the morning I would look across , the first thing in the morning , to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last thing , I would look to see if you had gone to bed . MCGARRY I 'm not a psychiatrist , but what do you suppose made you change ? The knowledge that I was harmless , or something deeper ? ANNA I think you know what made me change . MCGARRY I might have a theory , but what 's yours ? ANNA I think I began to change when Archie went away , two days after my party . When he did n't come back and did n't come back I suddenly realized I had no one to turn to . I quarrelled with Zita and made her hate me . You know I 've been alone in that house for twelve days and nights . p. 98 MCGARRY I did n't realize that . I noticed Archie was n't around , but I did n't know Zita had gone . ANNA They went away together . MCGARRY Are they together now ? Do n't answer that if you do n't want to . ANNA I ca n't answer it . At least , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my very eyes . You see how little I observed . ANNA That tells me something . MCGARRY What 's that ? ANNA It tells me that Mary has n't noticed either . MCGARRY She has n't said anything . But she 's been very busy , getting my pictures framed , and her regular work at the Library . The days pass quickly here , Mrs. Douglas . The seasons , and the years . The summer people arrive and go away , and we 're alone , then it 's baseball season again and pretty soon the summer people are back  --  you 'd be amazed . I 'm telling you this because I did n't realize it was two weeks since your party . And you 've been alone ten days , was it ? ANNA Twelve days , and twelve nights . MCGARRY ( gently ) Your pride kept you from coming over here ? You could have talked to Mary . p. 99 ANNA I am talking to Mary now . You are both one to me . I would not have told Mary without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that you ca n't tell Mary . MCGARRY ( deeply moved ) Thank you . ANNA You perhaps wonder why I came over now ? I 'll tell you . I could not stand it any longer , so I rang up Archie at his hotel . I know he has been staying at the St. Regis , so this afternoon I telephoned him there . They said he checked out today and left no forwarding address . What am I going to do ? MCGARRY What about Zita ? Would she be at the St. Regis too ? ANNA She might , she might not . They know us there . She could be in a suite with him and they would not suspect anything wrong . MCGARRY I do n't think Archie would do that . ANNA You like Archie , do n't you ? MCGARRY Yes , I do . ANNA Men do . They really like him . MCGARRY ( slightly annoyed ) Do n't women ? ANNA Never for very long . MCGARRY You do . You love him . p. 100 ANNA ( wearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks in the New York phone book and dials O and speaks ) Plaza 3-4500 . ANNA No ! No ! What are you going to do ? MCGARRY ( holding up his hand ) Just a minute Is Miss Zita Schmidt registered , or Miss Zita Douglas ? I see . Thank you . ( He hangs up . ) They know her , all right . No , she has n't been there for quite some time . Mr. Archie Douglas has been there but checked out today . ANNA Why did you do that ? MCGARRY I wanted to make sure about Zita . Did you ask for her when you phoned ? ANNA No . MCGARRY Why not ? ANNA I was ashamed . MCGARRY You did n't want to know . If she was there , you did n't want to know it . ANNA But I do n't know anything now . She could be staying some other place but still be with Archie . MCGARRY That 's true . I think the important thing is to find her . I can see why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd it be if I called a few places where she 's likely to be , and I 'll just say it 's Tom McGarry calling . Nobody will know who Tom McGarry is. p. 101 CLAIBORNE ( entering with magazines ) Good afternoon , Mrs. Douglas . ANNA Good afternoon , Claiborne . CLAIBORNE I could only find seven instalments . The fourth one , I ca n't imagine what happened to it unless it 's in your room . MCGARRY Never mind now , Claiborne . CLAIBORNE Anyway I think the gentleman 's coming . A car 's coming up the driveway . MCGARRY Thanks . ( She leaves . ) The gentleman is Henry Countryman coming to ask about that play . ANNA ( nervously ) Then I must leave . MCGARRY Not before he gets here . HENRY appears from Right . HENRY Why hello , Anna . ANNA Henry darling . HENRY Doctor McGarry . MCGARRY How are you , Mr. Countryman . ( They shake hands . ) ANNA I must be going . HENRY I saw Archie one day last week , just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me. 21 ? I thought it was the Colony . HENRY No , I 'm quite sure it was 21 . ANNA I may have got mixed up . HENRY I was only in town overnight . I 'm sure it was 21 . ANNA Such serious discussion over such unimportant matters . When you are finished with Dr. McGarry come over to me for a drink if you feel like it , Henry . HENRY I may take you up on that . ( She leaves . ) That 's a great woman , Doctor . I could tell you things about her that would amaze you . MCGARRY I 'll bet you could . HENRY Sometimes I wish I 'd studied medicine . I think I 'd have been pretty good , you know . Possibly not as a surgeon , but in the mental field , for instance . For instance , people seem to like to tell me things . I 'm the repository for more confidences than you can imagine . People in the theatre , you know , they 're not very self-reliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more troubles than other people , but they exaggerate them , and they 're always looking for someone to confide in , and let me tell you , a good many of them come to Old Papa Countryman . MCGARRY I should think they would . p. 103 HENRY And not only the ones that are in my plays . Others as well . For instance , Anna there . In the strictest confidence , of course ? MCGARRY Of course . HENRY Well , she 's been having a bit of trouble lately . MCGARRY Oh ? HENRY Mabel and I had asked Anna and Archie to come over and dine with us one night last week , and they accepted . But then at the very last minute  --  or practically  --  the afternoon of the day they were coming  --  she telephoned me and begged off . MCGARRY Mm-hmm ? HENRY She was worried , not about herself , but about Archie . She told me  --  this is all in confidence , of course ? MCGARRY Oh , yes . HENRY She told me that Archie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can get into the blackest depression of anyone I know . So Anna suggested a trip to New York . Told him to go to town and buy a few neckties , take a pretty girl to lunch , get a bit tight . MCGARRY I see . Change of atmosphere . HENRY Exactly . She knows how to handle him . When I told her a moment ago that I 'd seen Archie , that was my way of telling her  --  well , that I approved of her suggestion . If I had n't approved of it I would n't have said anything about it . Do you see what I mean ? p. 104 MCGARRY In a way . Not quite . But I think I do . HENRY If I had n't said anything about seeing Archie , that would have meant a tacit disapproval . MCGARRY Oh , now I understand . HENRY You see , they not only confide in me . They also want my approval . I 'm not a hell of a lot older than most of these people , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , is Archie back ? MCGARRY I do n't know . I have n't seen him , but of course that does n't mean anything . I do n't get around as much as most people , and I 've been reading the play . HENRY Ah , now we come to it . Good . I much prefer to have you mention it first and not me . What is your reaction  --  now that is n't as abrupt as it may seem . My full question is : What is your reaction percentage-wise as a hit , as a prestige play , and so on . First , what chance would you say it had of being a hit ? MCGARRY Percentage-wise ? HENRY Yes . MCGARRY Oh  --  eighty per cent . HENRY Eighty per cent is very close to what I estimated . What about prestige ? MCGARRY Percentage-wise ? p. 105 HENRY Yes . MCGARRY Up in the nineties . Maybe as high as ninety-five per cent . HENRY Really , now that 's good to hear . I said ninety-five , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mabel , my wife , she thinks ninety-five too , but she 's an admirer of Bellini 's . Thinks he 's the coming playwright , first one she 's been enthusiastic about since Christopher Fry . She puts Bellini alongside Williams right now , and she thinks this play puts him very close to Fry . Now what about your personal enjoyment of the play , just reading it , how would you grade it ? MCGARRY Frankly , about seventy-five per cent . Some of it 's obscure and I had to go back and read over a couple of places . HENRY ( chuckling ) That 's all right . I did too . I do n't mind that a bit . I do n't even think that hurts at the box office . Not nowadays . Look at Tom Eliot and The Cocktail Party . We went to see that twice here and once in London , and I still have a few points I 'd like cleared up , but that does no harm . I 'm sure I 'm no stupider than a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people did like it . I 'm very glad you said seventy-five per cent , because it makes your opinion even more valuable . It means I 'm not getting the opinion of a terrific highbrow . I know you 're a man of superior intelligence , Doctor , but frankly I was just a touch worried that you might be too highbrow . p. 106 MCGARRY Not me . I 'm average , just average . HENRY No . No . But you 're not a pundit . And I think you under-stand my problems with this play . You know I 'll give it a good production . I never let down on that . Do n't forget I 've lost a couple of fortunes in the theatre as well as made them . MCGARRY Oh , I think everybody knows a Henry Countryman production , what that means . HENRY Thank you . I 'm just as proud of some of my failures as I am some of my successes . Well , not to go on blowing my own horn I believe you said eighty per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MCGARRY Eighty per cent . HENRY When you arrived at that figure you had in mind a top production , naturally . No expense spared , and so on . But did you particularly have in mind any actors or actresses ? MCGARRY ( a longish pause ) Well , that 's hard to say . Naturally I began to visualize various people in the more important parts . HENRY ( excitedly ) Naturally , naturally . Now will you tell me the first two who come to your mind ? Thinking back on the man and the woman in this play , which actor and which actress do you see in those parts ? I want you to be absolutely frank . p. 107 MCGARRY ( deliberately ) Anna Root for the woman , Archie Douglas for the man . HENRY ( jumping to his feet ) Wonderful ! Wonderful ! By God , Doctor , you said exactly what I was hoping you 'd say ! Those two , together for the first time . I tell you , man , oh  --  let me shake your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea how this pleases me . ( He sits down . ) Let me tell you about this play . I had first refusal on it  --  that means , I saw it first . You know . First refusal . Well , I read it through twice in one day , but I was n't through the second reading before I realized what my big problem was going to be . Casting those two parts . Well of course there were some obvious ones  --  Alfred and Lynn , Rex and Lilli , and so on . Established couples . And it had to be a couple . I was convinced of that . But the established ones , either they were n't available , or they did n't quite fill the bill . And time was getting short . I had to give this Bellini an answer . He 's an impatient little pansy . So I put him off . Doubled his advance and even raised his royalty , just so I could hold on to this play . I did n't want anyone else to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go if I did n't come up with the right man and woman , and then out of the blue , so to speak , Anna had that dinner party a few weeks ago  --  the night I met you  --  and I could hardly eat that good dinner . I knew Anna and Archie were just right for the play , but I was n't sure how Bellini would react . So I telephoned him in Rome , and the little son of a bitch is away somewhere in Africa . I could n't find out where in Africa , and Africa 's a hell of a big place . But I got my spies working , some of those curious little people in Rome that have sponged off me for years , and I finally got one to tell me where Bellini was . He was n't in Africa at all . He just gave out that story . He was in Portugal , Estoril , Portugal , with some of his little playmates . Well , I called him there and he 'd just started back to Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow or the next day , or the day after , and do you know some-thing , I 'm going to be there to meet him ! I 'm going to fly to Rome and say , " Look here , young man . I have the right people for your play , " and I wo n't leave till he says yes . p. 108 MCGARRY You anticipate trouble ? HENRY I always anticipate trouble with playwrights . He has the right to approve or disapprove the principal actors in this play . MCGARRY Does he know American actors  --  and English ? HENRY This fellow knows every actor , every actress alive . He 's been in this country . Speaks perfect English . He knows his rights , too , and he has a very tough agent . I do n't want to deal with the agent . I want to handle this personally . And you made up my mind for me . MCGARRY I did ? HENRY Well  --  at least you gave me the impetus . When I spoke to his friends in Portugal I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had my office start making the arrangements . But you did give me the final impetus . I got the idea for casting Anna and Archie that night and Mabel , my wife , she saw exactly what I meant . But your opinion had a great deal to do with it , at least it was what they call the final convincer . MCGARRY Well , I 'm very pleased . HENRY I ca n't tell you how pleased I am . I have a notion to call Mabel . She was very much interested in what you were going to say . MCGARRY Here 's the phone . p. 109 HENRY ( after a quick hesitation ) No . I ca n't allow a word of this to get out , not till after I 've seen Bellini . And I must ask for your solemn word of honour that you wo n't say a word to anybody . Not even Mrs. McGarry . MCGARRY I 'm bound to tell Mrs. McGarry , but she 's a doctor 's wife . She keeps secrets . HENRY Well , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to Anna and Archie . If they knew they were being considered and then I was n't able to convince Bellini  --  this would break their hearts . It would really wreck them . MCGARRY I can promise for Mary and me . We wo n't say a word to anyone . HENRY Please do n't . For their sake as much as mine . You know what they said the other night , they were looking for a play to do together . Little did they know . MCGARRY Little did they know . HENRY Another favour , Doctor . They knew I was going to give you the play . MCGARRY Yes . HENRY Do n't let them pump you . If they try to ask you any questions about the play , you tell them  --  tell them , very casually , tell them you thought it was an amusing play . But not for Broad-way . That always a good out . Amusing , but not for Broadway . If they want any details just say you 're sworn to secrecy . That 'll hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll certainly tell them that you had them in mind all the time . p. 110 MCGARRY ( laughing ) Do you think I can act that well ? HENRY Of course you can . You medicoes are acting all the time . If you 're anything like my doctor , he gives a performance every time I go to his office . Performance worth six-sixty , though . Not what I pay him . ( He rises , and TOM hands him the script , which has been lying on table . They shake hands . ) I 'm going to bring you a present from Rome . You like leather , do n't you ? MCGARRY I do n't want a present . This was a pleasure . HENRY I know just what I want to get you . I know an Italian leather man . I think he 's the best in the world , myself . I 'll call you as soon as I get back . Maybe I 'll call you from Rome , if you 're interested . MCGARRY Of course I am . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't successful I may not be back . I may strangle a certain Italian playwright . MCGARRY Good luck , the best . HENRY Thank you . Thank you for everything . He exits and TOM waits a moment , rings the silver bell , and calls out : " Claiborne . " CLAIBORNE enters . p. 111 CLAIBORNE Ready for your iced tea ? MCGARRY Not for the time being . Claiborne , go out in the kitchen and watch to see when Mr. Countryman 's car gets out of sight . ( She goes out , but her voice is heard . ) CLAIBORNE Almost all the way down the driveway . Now he 's turning . He 's turning towards Southampton . Now he 's on the road . Now he 's going , getting moving , now he 's really moving , really moving . MCGARRY Okay , thanks . ( He dials three digits on the phone . ) Mrs. McGarry , please Mary ? I just wanted to tell you . This is Top Secret You know who I mean by Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Right Well , I just wanted to tell you . He wants Anna and Archie for that job . You get what I 'm driving at ? Good . See you . ( He puts hand on phone cradle and dials three digits . ) This is Dr. McGarry . Can you come over ? I have some news . Good . ( Smiling . ) Yes , I can see you . ( Hangs up . ) Just bring some ice , Claiborne . Never mind the iced tea . Just a bucket of ice and a pitcher of water . He lights his pipe and CLAIBORNE brings the ice bucket and water , puts them on portable bar and exits . ANNA enters from terrace . p. 112 MCGARRY Would you like a drink , or is it too early ? ANNA I do n't think I want a drink . Shall I fix you one ? MCGARRY Yes , if you do n't mind . Scotch whisky , plain water , in a tall glass . ( She goes to bar . ) You told Mary you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , back to him ) Yes . MCGARRY Do you remember the scene where the donkey cart breaks down , in the village ? ANNA Donkey cart in the village ? MCGARRY The wheel of the cart is supposed to break . ANNA No . Is this the new Bellini , or an old one ? Is this the play that Henry is going to do ? MCGARRY Yes . ANNA ( shaking her head ) There is no such scene in the play . MCGARRY I know there is n't . I just wanted to be sure you 'd read it . ANNA ( handing him the drink ) Oh . I read the play . Of that you may be quite certain . Five hundred dollars , bribe money . ( She smiles wearily . ) You do n't trust me. p. 113 MCGARRY Well , I wanted to be absolutely sure . You do n't always tell the truth , do you ? ANNA ( standing near him ) Who does ? What have you to tell me ? MCGARRY I do n't always tell the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honour . I am now about to break my word of honour . In the simplest possible language , Henry Countryman  --  ANNA Oh , no ! Oh , no ! MCGARRY Yes . Wants you and Archie for the play . ANNA Oh , God ! She raises her eyes , but her hands fall to her sides limply . He looks away from her and takes a sip of his drink , not intruding on her emotion . MCGARRY I gave him my word of honour I would n't say anything to read the play . I suppose that makes a little difference . Countryman is flying to Rome to talk to Bellini , to get Bellini 's approval of you and Archie . ANNA When ? MCGARRY Why , tomorrow , I think . Maybe tonight . He 'll be in Rome day after tomorrow . ANNA ( pleading , possibly to God ) Where is Archie ? MCGARRY I have some friends in the state police  --  but that would n't do any good . I could call The Players club . p. 114 ANNA He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MCGARRY Is n't it worth a call ? ANNA No . MCGARRY I could call 21 . ANNA He checked out of his hotel . He 's left New York , of that I 'm sure . MCGARRY I think what I 'll do  --  you help me make a list of all the places he 's likely to be , and I 'll call every one of them and leave my name . He may not want to call back if you leave your name , but when he sees my name it 'll arouse his curiosity . ANNA All right . 21 , El Morocco , Voisin , the Colony , Sardi 's , Chambord , Passy , Pavillon , the Links Club  --  Robbie Thomas is a member there . MCGARRY ( with pencil and paper ) Not quite so fast , please . After the Colony ? ANNA Voisin . MCGARRY I have that . Voisin , Colony , and the other ones I have are 21 and El Morocco . ANNA Oh , what 's the use ? MCGARRY Well , there 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is momentarily surprised to see ANNA , but she is not embarrassed . p. 115 ZITA Hello , Mother . Good afternoon , Dr. McGarry . Is Mrs. McGarry at home ? ANNA Hello , Zita . MCGARRY She 's at the Library . ANNA Is Archie with you ? ZITA He 's in that house . ANNA Is he all right ? ZITA He is sober , is that what you mean ? That 's what it sounded like . Yes , he 's sober . He does n't get tight . ANNA I 'll see you later , Doctor . Thank you very much . ZITA ( as ANNA is leaving ) I hope you 're not going to make a fuss . ANNA ( with a heavy attempt at lightness ) What about , Zita ? ( She exits , terrace door . ) ZITA Do you expect Mrs. McGarry back soon ? MCGARRY I do n't know . She has no set time . But if you 'd like to wait  --   --  ZITA ( over the three last words ) Would you mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace if you 're busy . MCGARRY You 're not disturbing me . Would you like a drink ? I 'm having a touch of Scotch . p. 116 ZITA I do n't like the taste of liquor . I simply do n't like the taste . It is n't any moral scruple . ( She looks up at him quickly . ) MCGARRY ( inquiring about her look ) What ? ZITA I imagine you 're thinking I have no moral scruples . MCGARRY I was n't thinking anything of the kind . ZITA You know I 've been away . MCGARRY I noticed you have n't been around . ZITA Has Mother been in and out of here ? MCGARRY This afternoon ? She was here earlier , yes . ZITA I meant the last week or so . MCGARRY No . But I think that 's the kind of question to ask your mother , not me . If you want to know what she 's been doing , ask her . She is quite self-possessed , and more mature than she has appeared to be heretofore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect Mrs. McGarry , in  --  an hour , say ? MCGARRY Well , if she comes home before she goes to get the mail and papers , yes . But if she stays at the Library , or in the village , no . Would you like to talk to her on the phone ? There 's a phone in the bedroom . You can close the door . The number is three-oh-seven. p. 117 ZITA Thanks . She goes to bedroom at Left , closing the door behind her . TOM takes a sip of his drink and ARCHIE comes in from Right , the terrace door . ARCHIE Hul-lo , Tom . ( They shake hands . ) It is good to see you again . MCGARRY Good to see you , Archie . We 've missed you . ARCHIE Yes . Mm . That 's awfully good news about Henry Countryman 's play , is n't it ? ( He looks around , puzzled . ) MCGARRY Very good . Congratulations . ARCHIE Thanks . Thanks very much . Was n't Zita here a moment ago ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHIE Oh , yes . Well , what have you been doing with your-self ? MCGARRY What have I been doing with myself ? Same old things . Reading . Listening to the radio . Going on and off the wagon . Playing my usual poker , and bridge . Did some painting since the last time I saw you . ARCHIE Oh , yes . Good ? Did you like what you did ? The painting ? MCGARRY It was all right . ARCHIE Like to have a look at it , if I may . ZITA re-enters. p. 118 ARCHIE Hello , Zita . ZITA Hello , Archie . ( To TOM ) She left . MCGARRY Then she 's probably on her way home . Let 's have a drink on the terrace . I 've been in this house all day and I 'd like to get one breath of fresh air before the rain starts . ARCHIE Good idea . Shall I give you a push ? MCGARRY Okay . ARCHIE gives the wheel chair a push and when TOM is safely on the terrace ARCHIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHIE I 've got to talk to you . Do n't have any conversation with Anna till I 've had a chance to talk to you . This is terribly important , do you hear ? ZITA All right . ARCHIE goes out to terrace , ZITA sits in the living-room , silent until MARY comes in from the kitchen , slightly taken aback to find ZITA there , but glad to see her . MARY Why , Zita . What a pleasant surprise . They embrace . ZITA I do n't know how pleasant , but I guess it 's a surprise all right . MARY We missed you . Did you have a nice trip ? p. 119 ZITA You know where I was , do n't you ? MARY No , I do n't . But nobody does . Nobody . ZITA You 're trying to tell me that Mother does n't know . MARY Yes , I 'm telling you exactly that . She does not know where you 've been . ZITA She will in a little while . MARY I see . A silent pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 've been , but you 've all guessed . MARY There 's been some guessing . What did you expect ? ZITA Well  --  the guessing can stop . I 've been with Archie . You knew that , did n't you ? MARY I suppose I did . But I repeat : nobody really knows . If you and Archie want to cook up a story , and it 's a good enough story , your mother will have to believe it . And she wants to believe it now . ZITA But we do n't want to cook up a story . I 'm going away with Archie , and we came back to tell Mother . We 're going away to-night . I came to get a few things . MARY But you ca n't ! Not now , Zita . ZITA But I can , and I am , and I will . Now , tonight . p. 120 MARY Child ! Listen to me ! Have you seen your mother ? ZITA We said cordial how-do-you-do 's , here . MARY You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Archie for that new play . ZITA Well , he 'll have to do it without Archie . We 're not going to spend another night in that house . We love each other , and we 're going to get a whole new start . MARY A new start ? Do you know that the minute you leave here with Archie  --  that 's the end for both of you ? Anyway , Archie . ZITA In the theatre , maybe . But he 's through with the theatre anyway . He hates it , he 's through with it and the people in it . MARY You 're out of your mind  --  ZITA Thank you . MARY I do n't mean that , but what can Archie do ? ZITA Lots of things . He 's an able-bodied man . MARY What things ? ZITA Any number of things . Wall Street . Or work in a store , if necessary . MARY Do you know how old he is ? ZITA I know how old he is . He can get a job in a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I can work . I can get a job in a publishing house . A friend  --  p. 121 MARY Publishing houses are not taking on new people . They are laying off people . I know that to be a fact . ZITA Stop talking about it , please , Mrs. McGarry . This is all decided . It was n't just decided  --  this afternoon . I came to say good-bye to you because you were very kind to me this summer . I came here first to give Archie a chance to speak to Mother . MARY And he 's already spoken to your mother ? ZITA Of course he has . MARY looks out at TOM and ARCHIE chatting , and ARCHIE 'S manner is not that of a man who has just told his wife he is running away with her daughter . MARY Has he told you all about it ? What she said ? ZITA He has n't had a chance to . MARY I 'll give him a chance to , now . She goes out on terrace , ARCHIE rises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their greeting being audible , then ARCHIE enters the living-room . He looks at ZITA , hesitating before speaking . ARCHIE Thank God I have this chance to talk to you . ZITA Thank Mary . What about ? What 's up , darling ? p. 122 ARCHIE ( sitting beside her on the sofa ) You see , darling  --   --  ZITA It 's something about that play . I know that much . ARCHIE Yes . Apparently Henry Countryman wants Anna and me to do that Italian play . ZITA ( not believing her own words ) But you 're not going to . He hesitates , looking straight ahead . ARCHIE I have n't told her I would n't . ZITA That means  --  you did n't tell her we were going away . ARCHIE No . I did n't tell her . ZITA ( beginning to understand , but with sympathy for him ) You have n't quite made up your mind , darling . ARCHIE That 's not quite it . I have n't had time to think it all through , but I feel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her . She does n't know for certain that we 've been together , and she wants to believe we have n't . ZITA That 's what Mrs. McGarry said . ARCHIE I could do the play  --  think of the money  --  it 's bound to be a hit . I feel it in my bones . And once the thing 's a success I could tell Anna that I was in love with you . p. 123 ZITA ( helping him along ) The success is all she cares about . ARCHIE I believe that . I do , I believe that . ZITA And when would that be ? When do we tell her ? ARCHIE Well , if we commenced rehearsals in say , October . I imagine Henry 'd want about five weeks ' rehearsals , taking us into November . Play a week in New Haven and two or three , most likely three weeks in Boston . It 's quite possible we could open in New York very early in December . You and I could have our Christmas together . ZITA What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her good notices . This is really quite a break for us , as a matter of fact . I could be saving money all the while Do n't you agree , it 's better to start out with a little something in the bank ? ZITA It 's more comfortable . ( Rising ) Did you take my bag out of the car ? ARCHIE No , I did n't . But I will . ZITA No , you stay here with McGarrys . I have to cook up some explanation . ARCHIE Tell her you 've been off with some boy , that 'll be realistic . How about the boy with the motor-boats ? p. 124 ZITA I 'll think of something . ARCHIE tries to kiss her , and at first she draws away , then does kiss him , and goes out the Left door . He watches her leave , then goes out to the terrace , but at that moment the rain begins to come down , and there is a scurrying by TOM and MARY to come inside , followed by ARCHIE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised by rainfall . MARY You 're all right , Tom ? Shirt dry ? MCGARRY Damn rain . I 've been sitting in the house all day . I 'll be losing my healthy bronzed look . The bronzed Viking from County Clare . ARCHIE ( taking off his jacket ) Mind , Mary ? MARY Not at all . ARCHIE Say , how about those chairs and things ? MARY Oh , we leave them out all summer , rain or shine , day or night . Here comes Anna with a raincoat over her head . They look to Right and in a moment ANNA appears , laughing . She goes directly to ARCHIE and kisses his cheek lovingly , then puts down her macintosh . She speaks to MARY . ANNA My child has just made a naughty confession , but she 's twenty years old , and if it 's the boy I think it is  --  he 's nice . Uninteresting , but nice . Archie , did you know it all along ? p. 125 ARCHIE My lips are sealed . ANNA Mine are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affair . MARY I 'm not surprised at anything these days . MCGARRY That 's a profound remark . At this moment there is a report offstage , slightly muffled . ANNA Oh , thunder . MCGARRY No . ( He says it casually , but positively , knowingly . ) ARCHIE ( rather keenly ) No , that did n't sound like thunder . That was n't thunder ! He gets up and runs from the room , out of the terrace door Right , and they sit transfixed with the growing knowledge of what the sound was . They sit for a slow count of four and then there is a second report , exactly similar to the first . Then ROSE , the DOUGLASES ' coloured cook , appears at the terrace door . ROSE ( gently )                                                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
