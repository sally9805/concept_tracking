A tiny handful of bureaucrats who hold the new levers of power in their continent , they are often brilliant political leaders .. . but also spoiled , overprivileged , sometimes corrupt , and usually failures in running the economy of their countries . Al . n African official , speaking a few months ago at an open-air meeting deep in the bush , described the class to which he belongs : We who call ourselves an elite may have professional qualifications , but we do not have the spirit and drive our country needs , .. We must rid ourselves of the city intellectual 's mentality that looks at the peasant with contempt . Our first battle is with ourselves . If we do not change ourselves , we shall fail , and we shall have to lower our eyes when our children insult us . . The country was Senegal , but the self-criticism would apply to the new elite classes almost anywhere in independent Africa . The Senegalese official was directing his warning to Africa 's historic generation , the men who came to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of realizing the promise of independence . By now it is possible to see a distinctive pattern , an African style of ruling , in the way they govern . Their performance is , on the surface , oddly paradoxical . As political leaders the Africans have succeeded brilliantly . They have provided peace and stability to states that are tribalmosaics with no sense of national unity . Only yesterday , departing colonial administrators were predicting , rather hopefully it seemed : " When we leave , the tribes will be at each other 's throats . " But today the tribes are not at each other 's throats ; the inevitable struggles for power have been settled with an extraordinary absence of bloodshed and violence . The ex-Belgian Congo is of course an exception , for which the Belgians and other foreigners bear a heavy share of responsibility . Even in the Congo , as compared to Iraq or Algeria , there has been more noise than killing . Senegal is more typical of African politics . In December 1962 , armed men faced each other in the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Mamadou Dia . The crisis was resolved , however , without the loss of a single life ; the losers , Dia and his supporters , were jailed , not executed . In Lome , capital of Togo , President Sylvanus Olympio was assassinated in January 1963 by unemployed ex-soldiers . That morning I ? and everyone else ? walked the streets of Lome in safety , for the soldiers , once their tragic deed was done , did not go on to slaughter Olympio 's supporters or loot the city . In the fall of 1962 , after a year in Dakar , my wife and I spent several months traveling in the interior of ex-French West Africa to see what efforts the governments were making for rural development . We drove our Land-Rover through the remote bush of eight countries from Senegal to Nigeria . Since we left Africa last spring , we have become wearily familiar with questions like : " Were n't you afraid ? Were you in danger ? " 44 AFRICA 'S NEW ELITES We are tempted to answer : " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Africa , the automobile is a far greater menace to life than tribalism or politics . If any Africans frightened us , they were not spear throwers but truck drivers . The Passport to Power in the economic field , however , the new rulers ' performance has been far from brilliant . Despite grandiose development plans , the new governments have with few exceptions wasted their resources on prestige projects and conspicuous consumption by the ruling class . While the rural economy stagnates , vast sums are poured into such showpieces as the Abidjan palace of President Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast , with its Italian marble brought in by air . The notorious corruption of Nigeria has been documented by recent investigations . A " radical " regime like Ghana 's is embarrassed when the wife of a cabinet minister buys a gold bed . " This is not socialism , " declared the husband , Krobo Edusei , in the understatement of the decade , and the remark is repeated by those who remember the slogans of social justice on which the African rulers came to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believe , in their inner hearts , that economic progress is the rule of life , rather than ? as it has been at most times in most places ? the exception . Politics and education rate high on the African rulers ' list of priorities ; economic development ranks low . In another age governments such as these , combining stable minority-rule with a stagnant economy , could exist indefinitely . But in today 's Africa the upward thrust of education ? tossing up growing numbers of men whose aspirations can not be satisfied ? threatens the rulers with a time of testing far more severe than the struggle for independence . The men who guide Africa 's destinies are marked , indelibly , by a unique experience : the transition from white European to black African rule . They are , of course , a tiny elite . The African masses have no voice , and as yet show little desire for a voice , in political decisions . With rare exceptions the African elites are neither economic producers , as in a bourgeois capitalist state , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America . They are , rather , a " bureaucratic bourgeoisie " ? a class whose power and rewards depend almost exclusively on holding government jobs . The passport into this elite class is a diploma from a school set up by the European rulers . Many of the leaders come from poor or peasant backgrounds . For instance , Sawn Tour ? , now President of Guinea , was born of peasant parents in the north of his country . After attending a French primary school , he got his secondary education by correspondence . He worked as a clerk in the French administration before entering politics . When the typical African cabinet minister was educated , he was being trained ? since this was the usual function of his school ? to be a minor implement of European rule . Like Tout* Azikiwe of Nigeria was a clerk . Dia of Senegal , Maga of Dahomey , Keita of Mali , Nkrumah of Ghana were all teachers . With educated Africans filling low-level jobs , the empire could be run more cheaply ; fewer high-priced Europeans were needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming value of Europe and the virtual nonexistence of his own continent . In the French colonies he learned history through a text that begins : " Nos ancetres les gaulois . . . . " He went on to work , usually in a government office , in a society that was divided with a feudal rigidity . Europeans commanded , Africans served . Ability was of little importance , on either side . No effort was spared to drive home this distinction , to create , through pomp and privilege , a gap too broad to be bridged . The price , to many Africans , of European education was a profound alienation from their own people . " I find myself more at home with French friends than with my own elder brother who has never been to school , " Sekou Toure once said . Only a decade ago it seemed to young Africans that this society might last forever . " We lived withdrawn into ourselves , " an African official told me of those days . " We were passive , we avoided responsibility ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were collaborating with our conquerors . " When the Europeans went home after independence , they left behind a generation profoundly influenced by their presence ? " the vieux ne-gre roughly , an Uncle Tom who sleeps in all of us , " as President Leopold Senghor of Senegal put it recently . On independence day the new rulers naturally seized the familiar symbols of power , the pomp and circumstance by which the Europeans had David Hapgood , a newspaperman by trade , went with his wife and her two children to Africa for two years on a grant from the Institute of Current World Affairs . Formerly on the " New York Times , " he is writing a book on Africa . emphasized their distance from the African masses . African leaders moved into the palaces of the Europeans . Then . in capital after capital , they built their own palaces . " These men can no longer open a car door for themselves , " a chauffeur complained to me as we watched officials in the Ivory Coast descend from their slick black Mercedes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; why should his successor ? If it was beneath the European 's dignity to work with his hands , then why should his successor demean himself by manual labor ? The stereotype of the European-in-Africa lingers on . Time and again we were asked : " Where is your chauffeur ? " or : " Where is your servant ? " A profound desire to match the ex-rulers who despised them , to have what they had , to cancel out somehow Europe 's vast superiority in power and wealth , seems to underlie the outwardly irrational behavior of the African elite in power . It explains the television stations sprouting in poverty-stricken nations where desperate human needs are being neglected . When you see in one capital after another newly installed traffic lights on streets that can safely be crossed with your eyes closed , you begin to wonder why . The answer , I suspect , is not that the African officials were fools enough to think the traffic lights necessary , but simply that their presence makes Niamey or Ouagadougou took more like London or Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of Europe for its substance , that they imitate European consumption but not European productivity ? a course likely to lead to bankruptcy . When the chairman of Ghana Airways was questioned recently about the airline 's huge losses , he replied : " We in Ghana Airways are charged with the duty of carrying the national flag to all parts of Africa and projecting the African personality . " The loser in this jet-propulsion of the " African personality " is , of course , the Ghanaian peasant 30,000 feet below the glittering airliner . African governments make little effort to justify in economic terms their most striking form of status-seeking : the lavish amounts of scarce foreign exchange spent on setting up embassies abroad . In a large number of international capitals , housing costs are being driven out of sight by a proliferation of African embassies which can be justified by none of the normal criteria : no trade relations , no citizens to look after , no necessary diplomatic business to transact . Aid can be obtained without an embassy . Upper Volta , landlocked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-man embassy halfway around the world in Tokyo , with only the vaguest of " cultural interests " as the official explanation . Senegal maintains two embassies in Rome , with a total of twenty employees ; one is to the Vatican , although Senegal is 80 per cent Moslem . Mali , which used to trade insults with Senegal over which of the two was on the proper road to socialism , has an embassy in , of all places , North Korea . Ghana and Nigeria compete in the size of their embassies and the lavishness of their entertainment . As we entered the Nigerian embassy in Dakar , Senegal , for a reception , an African student whispered : " Fancy parties in fancy houses ? that 's Africa today . " ' Obviously the African embassy , in the eyes of the elite , is a visual symbol of admission to the family of nations , of Africa 's equality with Europe . But it is an edifice built on sand . For the same embassy also symbolizes a more somber truth ? the dangerous and unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foreign exchange that went into building and maintaining the embassy did not go into building a factory for agricultural tools , or for importing fertilizer or seed . ( Similarly , the official 's Mercedes means that an agricultural agent in the bush did not get the Land-Rover that might have enabled him to do a better job . ) The whole trend , in fact , is in the wrong direction . Many African nations , though their economies are agricultural , are importing increasing amounts of food . For some , like Senegal and Guinea , American surplus rice has become a necessary crutch . As the trade deficit worsens , foreign aid becomes essential and rulers are forced to play the Cold War game to avoid bankruptcy . Some nations which receive aid from all quarters ? Mali is the best example ? seem on their way to becoming what might be called multilateral client states . " Black Like You " The gap between the elite , living by European standards , and the African masses is more glaringly obvious than the distance between ruler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the African people are peasants who produce crops worth $40 to $80 a year . This is the real " proletariat " of Africa . By comparison with the peasant , a lowly government clerk and notable exception is Tanganyika , which announced at independence that it would open only three embassies . an auto mechanic earning perhaps $60 a month are members of a privileged minority . At the upper end of the scale is the cabinet member who is paid $600 a month , plus a government-financed car and chauffeur , villa , and servants , Even the minister 's servants , earning $30 a month , consider themselves fortunate not to be working the land . This gap between elite and non-elite is cultural as well as economic . The unemployed primary-school graduate is at least a candidate for the elite ; he has far more standing than the working peasant . When one observes the indifference with which many African " socialists " view the common spectacle of old women carrying crushing burdens on their heads while young men loaf or frisk about , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk of African socialism , it was not a revolution aimed at greater equality among human beings . It was , rather , a sort of coup d'etat , a palace revolt in which the elite took over the positions denied them by the Europeans . " I am black like you , " a Senegalese governor kept telling his people while we were touring together last year . But although he is black , the governor is little more " like them " than his French predecessor . Born in another part of the country , educated in French schools , he lives in an air-conditioned home and can speak to his people only through an interpreter . As we bounced through the bush , the governor turned the conversation to Europe . Talking with ease and authority on French literature , he seemed to care little about his own country 's culture . For the foreigner who goes to Africa expecting to find the elite busily engaged in building a new nation , the first meetings with African officials are likely to be disappointing . One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Rural Economy , whom I will call M. N. He held a French law degree , spoke French perfectly , and was clearly in the higher reaches of the elite . His salary was $4,000 a year ? more than the average peasant earns in a lifetime ? plus government-supplied housing and other privileges . Like almost all African officials , M. N. was graciously hospitable to a foreigner , whether in his office or in his home . When he said " drop in anytime " he meant it . He was patient with my questions , though he skirted any subject that suggested any conflict among the Senegalese , but it soon became obvious that talk about peasant problems bored him . He wanted to show me his new slide projector or talk about cars . M. N. , I sensed , was profoundly conservative , and withgood reason : he had suddenly made it to the top of the heap , and he was mainly interested in enjoying his new position . " Paid for by The People " When the elite took over power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . How could they , when the state was an alien ruler ? Today the most vigorous of African leaders seem powerless to hold down the corruption that disfigures their governments . ( Many regimes do not even try to hold down corruption . Most of my examples are deliberately chosen from the governments that are at least making an effort . ) Despite Toure 's prestige , his regime in Guinea has been rocked by scandals . Last December he got no response when he hinted to a party congress that the most corrupt of the party leaders be purged . Unpunished corruption and indolence at the summit set a discouraging example to those who work in the lower levels of the government . And the money that disappears from the treasury is not reinvested in the nation 's economy ( as a crooked American politician might , for example , invest in a business ) . If it is not spent , it is more likely to follow the well-worn route to a secret Swiss bank account . This was said to be the case of Valdiodio N'Diaye. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last December . N'Diaye presented himself in Senegalese politics as more " socialist " than his colleagues . In addition to the Swiss bank account , he had a lavish mansion in his hometown , on which someone once painted : " Paid for by The People . " N'Diaye was jailed , not for corruption , but for choosing the losing side in the 1962 political crisis . At about the same time , another high Senegalese official was accused by a colleague of looting the treasury of $150,000 , but he was on the winning side in the crisis and the charges were never made public . If an African official does try to resist the temptations of power , he is beset on another flank by his relatives . The African tradition of family solidarity requires the successful man to support any relative , even a distant cousin , who asks him for help , When you call on an African official in the capital , you usually see a dozen or more of his kin loitering around the compound , eating up his salary as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others feel little or no obligation to look for jobs . " Save ? " a Senegalese official replied when I asked what he did with his pay . " Save ? I spend my pay before I get it ? otherwise it all goes to my relatives . " So the official will try to place his relatives in the bureaucracy arid , to keep his head above water , he may seize one of the easy opportunities for corruption ; loyalty to the living family unit means more than loyalty to the abstraction called the state . Rarely does an official defy tradition by turning down a relative . More likely he will flee . I heard frequently of Africans seeking foreign assignments simply to escape their family obligations . Harmful as it is in many ways , this solidarity does keep alive people who might otherwise starve to death , and it serves the useful purpose ' of redistributing some of the excessive income of the elite . Today 's corruption and prestige spending are viewed by the optimists , both African and foreign , as temporary aberrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " President Senghor replied when I asked him about corruption in Senegal . Others point out that the monumental corruption of nineteenth-century American government did not prevent the nation 's rapid development . But the United States was developed by private entrepreneurs . In Africa , where the equivalent of the venturesome American capitalist does not exist , economic progress depends on the state . The optimists argue , further , that the African elites will settle down to productive effort once the palaces are built , that they build them because they are " ignorant of economics , " and that the next generation of leaders will be better because they will have more education . The argument based on economic ignorance , which I have heard frequently from Africans , seems on analysis rather insulting . It implies that President Hubert Maga of Dahomey , for example , does not realize that the 83 million he is spending on a palace could have been used to increase corn production . Another optimistic line of reasoning seems to derive from the Western belief in the inevitability of progress , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The example of Latin America , after more than a century of independence , serves as melancholy evidence that the habits of the elite do not necessarily improve , and that a Western education does not make the elite less grasping or more productive . A Comparison with Louisiana Pessimists draw their evidence from the Emperor Jones overtones of the African elite . When a new scandal or blunder reaches the rumor circuit , the remaining Old Africa Hands around the hotel bar shake their heads and say with ill-concealed satisfaction that Africa is going to the dogs . And Senator Ellender reaches the conclusion , after a brief tour , that Africans are incapable of governing themselves . Incapable by what standard ? No African government is one fraction as baldly brutal and grasping as that of Trujillo ? praised by Ellender ? or half-a-dozen other recent Latin American tyrants . Indeed , considering their handicaps , some compare favorably with the governing , within recent memory , of Ellender 's home state of Louisiana . Most African regimes are one-party states , but they are by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of Guinea and Ghana , you realize that it is nonsense to call these nations " totalitarian . " The opposition is suppressed , but not with the barbarism of a Hitler or a Stalin . In the short turbulent history of Guinea , both France and the Soviet Union have interfered in the little nation 's internal politics ; but there has been no mass slaughter of " traitors " or reprisals against the French and Russians in Guinea . Despite official hostility , and despite floats in parades depicting Europeans beating Africans , some two thousand French citizens have lived peacefully in Guinea since 1958 ; American missionaries in Mamou , a solidly Moslem area , told us they have not been molested since the French left . The cult of personality around Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana is distasteful , but it is mild compared to the Stalin cult . Nor is it typically African : Sekou Toure and Julius Nyerere of Tanganyika particularly discourage personal adulation . Despite the misdeeds of government in black Africa , you do not find the sort of complacency in exploitation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ideals of social justice proclaimed by African leaders are in practice grotesquely distorted , but they continue to impel some governments toward reform . Julius Nyerere , alone among African presidents , posed for his official photograph wielding a pick , to show the elite that manual work is not demeaning . In Senegal , a government-sponsored movement called " rural animation " is trying to give a voice to the peasantry . Tour6 has attempted , through the Parti Democratique de Guinee , to create a mechanism of popular control over the elite , He has not succeeded yet . What the Guinean elite actually does is in sharp contrast to Toure 's expressed views . In N'Zerekore , a provincial capital far in the interior , we were taken on a tour by the local commandant . With the usual African hospitality , the commandant told us in fluent French that he would show us " the accomplishments of our revolution . " What he showed us was : his own mansion and office , the two largest buildings in town ; a fancy villa for the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other villas for guests ; a park for " tourists , " who arc rare indeed , with gravel paths bearing such names as " Boulevard du People " ; a hotel under construction , though N'Zar ? lcore. already has a hotel ? . this , also , is " for tourists " ; thirty-six units of housing for the military who guard the border against an unlikely foe . It did not seem to bother the commandant , nor anyone else I spoke to , that none of these accomplishments of the Guinean " revolution " were of any use to the people of N'arekure . And the case of N'Zerekore is repeated in many forms throughout Guinea . It is easy , but far too hasty , to conclude that Toure 's frequent speeches telling the people to watch over their rulers ' behavior either are meaningless or are falling on deaf ears . The Guinean experiment is after all still in its infancy ; Toure himself is only forty-one and his nation only five years old . The Uprooted Young Men The ideals enshrined in official mythology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of criticism within the elite itself . The euphoria of independence is passing , to be replaced by widespread comments on the sourness of freedom without progress . Paulin Joachim , editor of the African magazine Bingo , recently wrote ( in an editorial entitled " Those Who Work Against Africa " ) of a " rapacious bourgeoisie . . . cut off from the people , which it often exploits more cruelly than did the white colonialists . " And all over Africa I found people who were beginning to turn their attention away from the outside world to their own problems . Some of them were keenly aware of the corrupting effects of politically motivated foreign aid . In Madagascar , where the national airline is a favored form of conspicuous consumption , an opposition leader , Dr. Bertrand Ravelonanusy , said to me : " I 'm the first to say to all of you ? Americans , French , Germans , Russians ? keep your money . We do n't need it . All we 'll do with it is build another airport . " Yet such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they can find places for the elite in the establishment . Will they , then , last indefinitely , degenerating perhaps into hereditary oligarchies ? They might , were it not for the explosive effect of education . The African governments , prisoners of the notion that their countries ' modernization can be measured by its literacy rate , are building schools at a breakneck pace . The youth who are coming out of these schools , boys with primary-school certificates and additional large numbers who drop out of secondary school without graduating , are potentially the most dynamic and destructive class in Africa today . I often came across these young men . Once when we stopped in a distant bush town , two youths asked us for a ride to Dakar . They were in their late teens , and , judging by their poor French , they had at best finished primary school in the bush . They were , they said , going back to jobs in Dakar . Most Africans chat easily , but these two avoided personal questions and were silent most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and shouted to us , as they do to strangers whose passage briefly breaks the monotony of their lives . One of the youths said , with a harshness extraordinary in an African : " Look at those people ? they 're savages ? they do n't know anything . " When we arrived in Dakar , they were unable to direct me to the place where they said they worked , and it soon became obvious to me that they had never been in the city . Perhaps they had a relative there . Their chances of success in Dakar were remote . But they had had to flee the bush , because their few years of school had set them apart from the people they called " savages . " The schools themselves have not changed much since colonial times . Despite superficial reforms in some countries , they continue to reflect the deep cultural division in African society . The lesson taught by both school and society is , in essence , this : Peasants are illiterate and backward as icell as poor . Members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city is modern and has high status ; the country is primitive and has low status . If you have been to school , you belong in the elite simply because you are literate . Go to the city ? do n't stay in the bush . So the young men flock to the capital , where they will find shelter with an uncle or cousin from their village . They are poorly prepared for the change . They know a European language and some arithmetic . They know something about the ex-colonial power , more perhaps than they know of their own country . Seldom do they have a trade . Since manual trades are of low status , they have avoided the few trade schools in favor of a " classical " education . Their aspirations are wildly unrealistic . " I 'll be a cabinet minister ? ' children will say . They know that the generation before them reached prestige and power with the same education ; they see them riding around in their Mercedes . They do not know , or perhaps can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be repeated . So they join the horde of unemployed who are part of the social landscape of every African capital . Above all , these young men will not go back to the country and work as farmers or artisans ; this would be an admission of complete defeat . The efforts of African governments to find a place for the unemployed youth often have been opposed by the young men themselves . In Dahomey , unemployed young men were settled not long ago on farms set up by the state . A promising idea but . I found , when I looked into it , that the project had run aground on the attitudes of the young men . After six months ' work on the farm , they had collected their pay and gone off for two weeks ' vacation . Though they had earned more money than most of them had ever seen , two-thirds of the boys refused to return to the farm after their vacation . " Laziness " is probably the immediate foreign reaction . " It 's all right for peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me ; he glared with open hatred at the Dahomeyan official with me , the man who wanted to reduce the boys to peasant status . For in going back to the farm they would have been stranded on the " primitive " peasant shore of their society . Tinderboxes of Revolution The young men preferred to go back to their marginal existence in the city , where there is always the chance that someday someone will land them clerks ' jobs in the government . But every year the odds grow longer against them . Governments running heavy deficits can not afford to add to their swollen bureaucracies ; most remaining Europeans hold technical jobs for which half-educated youths can not qualify . Since the economy is stagnant , no new jobs are opening up in private employment . With narrowed horizons , with diminished hopes , bitterness grows ; the capital becomes a tinderbox of revolution . In conversations with the young unemployed , I found much bitter personal disappointment . One of these youths was Mamadou Ka , an unemployed auto mechanic who stopped by our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peasant family , about twenty-five years old and always shabbily dressed . He spoke and read French ; he had dropped out of secondary school because of illness , and then was too old to go on . He lived in Dakar with an uncle and tried to accept society as it was ; his only wish was to find a place in it . Like Mamadou , the young unemployed I met believed that the political parties were not interested in their problems . The parties , to them , were run by and for the successful members of the elite . They were bitter , but they did not seem ready to storm the palace , though in August the unemployed of Brazzaville helped drive Fulbert Youlou , President of the ex-French Congo , out of office . In this young continent ? one-half of Africa 's population is under twenty years old ? the problem of the uprooted young men is staggering . Of all the problems faced by Africa 's new leaders , none seems so dangerous as this . If Africa 's new elites can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , then history will doubtless forgive them their Swiss bank accounts . But if they fail ? in the words of the Senegalese official then their children will insult them .
