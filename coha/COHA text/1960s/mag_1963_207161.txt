When the noted international art dealer Georges Wildenstein was 14 years old , his father . Nathan , gave him two small works of art that were to become more precious to him than all the masterpieces that he later bought and sold . The gifts were illuminated miniatures that had originally been pages in a late 15th century manuscript , and they were the start of what is today the world 's biggest and best private collection . Last week 70 items from that collection were on public display at the Cloisters , the way-uptown adjunct of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum of Art . Some are less than 3 in. in height ; none are more than 24 in . All glitter with the gemlike colors that they had when their usually anonymous creators made them . <P> <P> Just why he decided to collect miniatures rather than any other type of art , Wildenstein , now 70 , can not really explain . " I just like-no , I love them , " he says . His collection lines the walls of his residences in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much affection as if it were the only one he possessed . Smiling genially behind his glasses , Wildenstein will suddenly get up from his chair , grab a visitor by the arm and begin steering him around the room . " Look at this , " he will say , pointing to an illumination by the 16th century Italian artist Giorgio-Giulio Clovio . " It 's a beauty . When one looks at a beautiful painting , il faut jouir , one should be enraptured . ' ' <P> Every Week to the Louvre . In the world of art , Georges Wildenstein-or " Monsieur Georges , " as he is known to his galleries in Paris , Manhattan , London and Buenos Aires-is an awesome figure who probably knows more about the peregrinations of Europe 's masterpieces than any man alive . But it is not just his huge file of photographs or his unparalleled collection of auction catalogues , or even his incredible memory , that accounts for his ability to spot a fake or dismiss a work of mediocrity within the blink of an eyelid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussians swarmed through it in 1870 and started the secondhand store in Paris from which the great art empire grew , put his son through a highly personal and rigorous training . When Georges was seven , his father would hold up an object and demand : " is it beautiful or is it ugly ? " Georges spent his youth in Europe 's museums and galleries , " looking , looking , looking . And I still go to the Louvre at least once a week when I 'm in Paris , to keep up with the great masters . "
