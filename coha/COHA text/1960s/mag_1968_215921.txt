Almost since the days when Druidic warriors daubed themselves with woad , the notion has persisted that British painting is a barbarous and insular affair . By and large , the thesis is correct - but there is an important century of exception . Between 1760 and 1860 , when Britain swept to the forefront among nations , its painters were as engaged and influential as its soldiers and diplomats were at Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna . <P> It was an eventful century to be exceptional in . The hundred years witnessed the French Revolution , the comet streak of Napoleon , the expanding British Empire abroad , the Industrial Revolution at home . In art , the era was marked by the emergence of Romanticism , that peculiar cult of the divine in nature , the grotesque , the bizarre , the irrational and the emotional . <P> Sense &; Sensibility . In painting , the Romantic era in France produced the art of David , Ingres and Delacroix , but Anglo-Saxon Britain far more nearly mirrored the chaotic spirit of the age through the diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner . How strikingly they and other British artists staked out the realm of the new sensibility in the Romantic era can be seen in a display of 236 oils , watercolors and drawings , assembled from collections in America and Europe , now at the Detroit Institute of Arts ( see color pages ) . " British Masterpieces , " which will be shown at the Philadelphia Museum of Art , pays little more than lip service to the aristocratic portrait and the studied landscape , the established prides and prejudices of English art . Instead , the era 's sense and sentiment is often best il lustrated by the casual sketch , the minor masterwork by the relative unknown . <P> Thomas Gainsborough , for example , is represented most tellingly by a flamboyant " fancy picture " ( a fantasy ) of a sleeping country girl . John Constable 's Study for " A Boat Passing a Lock " illustrates through its snapshot organization and cavalier brushwork his influence on Delacroix , Millet and Corot . Hardly less impressive are five canvases by the provincial Joseph Wright of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iron Forge to the protosurrealism of The Old Man and Death . <P> Miserable &; Mad . Indeed , the slightly schizoid Romantic preoccupation with nature and the supernatural , physical reality and psychological mystery , rooted itself easily in English soil . Swiss-born John Henry Fuseli ( 1741-1825 ) emigrated to England at 22 and took up painting with the encouragement of Sir Joshua Reynolds . His ghoulish portrayals of Shakespearean heroes and fantastic chimeras , such as The Nightmare , predated Goya 's grotesques by more than a decade and were immensely popular on the Continent . In their desire to get back to nature , the English Romantics also abandoned the ruins of Italy in favor of the English countryside and Alpine vistas . Crusty J.M.W. Turner seems to have been the first artist to visit Switzerland for the sake of sketching its mountains , but his Cottage Destroyed by an Avalanche is a vision of nature 's destructive forces rather than the record of any event .
