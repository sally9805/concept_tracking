One thing that 's wrong with British Papers A royal commission has placed on the desks of British publishers a 239-page report with a chilling punch line : journalism 's printing craft unions are bleeding the British press to death . <P> This stark conclusion was reached by five commission members appointed by Prime Minister Macmillan to examine a rising mortality rate in the British press . During almost two years of investigation , the commission , headed by Sir Hartley Shawcross , onetime Attorney General in the postwar Labor government , heard witnesses from both labor and management - although not all of the commission 's summonses were obeyed . " We are regretfully forced to conclude , " said the report , in noting that the paper workers ' and lithographers ' unions declined to cooperate with the inquiry , " that the real reason why each of them refused was fear of what might be revealed . " <P> But from those who did appear the commission gathered evidence of appalling inefficiency and waste-much of it directly traceable to union featherbedding practices . A management consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one out of every three men involved in the production and distribution of newspapers , the firm reported , could be discharged without any impairment of efficiency . Other findings : <P> &gt; Presses running consistently under capacity because of exorbitant union labor demands . The commission cited the experience of the Daily Telegraph , which was able to boost its press speed by 2,000 copies an hour ( from 25,000 ) only after meeting union demands that it hire 17 more printers . <P> &gt; Excessive-and largely unnecessary-labor costs . On four big dailies alone-the Express , Mirror , Mail and Times-this amounted to $6,720,000 a year . Only a tiny fraction of this went to administrative and editorial staffers . <P> &gt;Archaic labor techniques , frozen in place by union prerogative . The report took wry note of a four-year labor-management negotiation in which newspaper bundle tiers agreed to the installation of new bundle-tying machines-so long as their use cost not a single man his job . <P> &gt; The highest wage scale in British industry-some $14 a week above the industry-at-large rate . <P> Although holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management 's door . By yielding to incessant labor demands , said the report , the press only perpetuates the very extravagance and waste that spell financial disaster . Said the report darkly : if Fleet Street 's willingness to go along with union featherbedding " were to form the pattern for all industries , it would be disastrous to the economy of the nation . " The commission urged publishers to stiffen their resistance to labor , even suggested a way : the same united-front defense that prevails in many U.S. cities , where , by management agreement , all papers stop publishing when one is struck .
