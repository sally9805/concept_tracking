We had been sitting in the coffeehouse in Warsaw on what had begun as a dark Friday afternoon . It was now an even darker Friday night , and was threatening to become a gray Saturday morning . I had not wanted to be there . I had not filed anything to the Times in a week , and I should have been out somewhere finding hard news , not wasting my time drinking vodka that did not want to drink . In a correspondent 's life , the moments of gathering hard news turn uut usually to be the times most quickly forgotten , and the moments like this in retrospect turn out to be the most important part of his own private journal . But while he is on the spot and thinking of his editors he is always restless and impatient . Our table included Allen Ginsberg , the poet , in Poland on a Ginsberg Traveling Fellowship ( arrive slightly disheveled and unannounced , try to locate a few people who have read your poetry , stay with them , give a few lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disheveled ) and a Polish friend , a not-so-young poet , a little drunk and bitter , who was giving Ginsberg a very hardtime . Up to that moment Ginsberg had received a remarkably enthusiastic response from the Poles , but this had ended abruptly with my friend , who was then discussing the fine art of selling out in a Communist country . As he talked , other writers would stroll in and out of the room , and the Pole would point to some of them and note exactly how much they had sold of themselves ; in his way he was making it plain that he thought Ginsberg was soft . " You , " he said to Ginsberg , have not sold out yet . But if you lived in a country like this , maybe you would sell out too . Courage in the totalitarian society is the ability to wait . " The way he said it , he meant , You , Ginsberg , lvould sell out . Ginsberg began to say something , but the Pole angrily drowned him out . " Courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers in the country who had behaved particularly well , and had sold very little of himself ) , " is a matter of someone who is really and truly afraid and yet carries on , as in war , someone who knows fear and yet gets up and keeps going each day ; in a country like this it is someone who keeps writing but is always afraid . There are thousands of things you ca n't write about . The worst part of it is that these contradictions find their way into you , and become a part of you . You find yourself thinking like a censor , you become as twisted inside as a great serpent , and you never even know it 's happened to you . " Ginsberg said something about his own boyhood fear of having his father discover poems about homosexuality , but again the Pole waved him aside . " You talk about being beat . But you 're never beaten . Here we 're beaten every day , " he said . It went on like that for another hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ginsberg was something special , for Ginsberg was being published ? better , being published in the West . As he talked the vodka continued to disappear . ( In the restaurants , say the Poles , the vodka is good and cheap , and the food is poor and expensive . The state , indeed , frequently worrier about the problem of alcoholism and recently mounted a campaign against drinking and driving . " Alcohol is your enemy , " said the posters , and underneath someone scrawled , " No Pole is afraid of an enemy . " ) The meeting with Ginsberg broke up about 2:00 A.M. I have forgotten now what I did the next day , what story I wrote , what statistic I first quoted and then doubted . What is important is what I did not do : I did not write a story about Ginsberg and the poet , even though now I see it as one of the two or three most moving evenings of the year I spent in Poland . I failed to write it , not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a betrayal of the poet . It would surely have caused him very severe political problems . Yet it was an experience bound to affect the reporter profoundly in that most complicated of roles , being a Western correspondent in a European Communist country . This is not the Soviet Union , where there are a large number of Western correspondents reading Izvestia and Pravda , checking with the diplomats , and making the front pages with their stories on the smallest changes in one of the world 's superpowers , but their lives largely separated from those of most Russians . In Poland you would belong to that less than handful of reporters living in the East European countries , trying to write finally as if you had a window open to the daily life in the total state . These countries were once the center of the storm , and as the Curtain was coming down their hotels were filled with correspondents , pushingand crowding each other , playing what is known in the trade as journalistic boomerang ( you take a rumor , throw it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other people that it comes back to you fresh and vital , passed on by people you have n't even spoken to ) . The storm is now in Saigon , where several hundred correspondents cover the story of whether that country will or wo n't go Communist . Their editors are in a sense right ; for there is little news from Eastern Europe ? some change , some restlessness , but little hint of revolution . These are small countries : you can take all the political developments in the Polish Communist party in one year , and perhaps it will be one story . Yet for me it was an extraordinary time . My colleague David Binder , who shared the lower half of the tier , the Balkans , with me , agreed emphatically . When the Times wanted to transfer him to Bonn , a bigger story and bigger bureau , he went reluctantly , leaving what he had come to call " my people . " We shared , I think , the same feeling for being a reporter there , of watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving business of the daily struggle of these people with the state . Cast in the most unnatural circumstances , they go on in the struggle relentlessly , living lives with an infinite degree of moral complexity , daily courage , daily honor , daily dishonor . The reporter thinks of Warsaw , which is probably . technically , an ugly city built up from the ashes , not in a physical sense , but in a human one . The very existence of the city itself was for me an act of passion . The reporter goes through a comparable moral dilemma ; he lives in these countries ( some papers keep their East European man in Vienna , but the Times , bless it , insists on your living on the spot ; it is , I think , an important distinction ) , knows the problems of the big people and little people , knows ton many people who ca n't write , knows which plays are n't being produced , knows how long his friends have waited for apartments , and what they have to do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large in Eastern Europe he has little hard news . The closest thing to news in Poland is the church-state struggle , a cold war within a cold war , and if he is lucky , it will heat up when he is there . For the wire services it is the most basic of stories . Every Sunday night all the Polish assistants go off with their tape recorders following the Cardinal , making sure he makes no news ; The correspondent is there for very different reasons , seeking the same things he seeks in his own country , which in Poland constitutes a mild form of espionage . And so another cold war is born : the government trying to pressure , charm , coax , coerce , threaten the correspondent into what are known as more positive stories and a more positive outlook , and the correspondent , hanging on for dear life , measuring his powder , trying to decide how much he can get away with , how much of his powder each story will cost him without getting him thrown out . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upsets the chessboard , and there is more work for the auditing and travel departments , more families to move , more furniture to get lost ) . So the reporter writes and the foreign ministry , which in a Communist country is more or less the velvet glove on the steel hand , calls him in and tries to explain the mistake gently ; we are friends , and then the next time a little more imploring , please be nice ; and then less gentle . You must understand our situation in People 's Poland , what we have rebuilt in twenty years , please be a good boy , we are getting very angry with you ; then colder all the time , listing the errors . " This is not Vietnam , Mr. Halberstam . " I think I must have been called in six times , from writing that there were no oranges and Americans tipped their Polish maids by giving them orange skins to make cake with , to saying that when the state executed the chief of a giant meat-stealing ring , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision had been cleared as high as Gomulka . The most serious miscalculation on any story I made in Poland was on anti-Semitism . I would have written it even if I had known in advance what the price would be . It almost brought me immediate expulsion in April of 1965 , and it almost cost me my marriage , for it came at a time when my fianc ? e Elzbieta , a Polish movie actress , and I were trying to get married . Polish anti-Semitism is an old and ugly story . There are the historical reasons , a poor country with a rich landed aristocracy and a poor peasantry and the Jews in the middle ? Jews with beards eating different meats , praying to different Gods , wearing different clothes , speaking different languages . There are the new reasons ? the Jews were odd men out before the war , became prominent in the Communist party , and after the war . when it took over power , became odd men in , too powerful in a detested Party for their own good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Jews dead in Poland in World War II , murdered by Poland 's sworn enemy , and there are perhaps 20,000 left , and they are slowly dissolving into the society , or , because their children can no longer stand the stupid remarks , leaving the country . But there it is , it exists , insane , stupid , verbal anti-Semitism , dumb jokes , a subcurrent of the present culture ; and the Party , unpopular enough , now taking on the coloration of the society in order to appear more respectable ? we must give jobs to people with Polish names . ( American Jews of course are exempted from all this : they are Americans , not Jews . ) So it was , I felt , an obligatory story for a reporter ; what we do n't learn from the past is after all as important as what we do . I made the story a simple one , saying that there was a verbal anti-Semitism , that one wing of the Party was exploiting it , and that Jews continued to migrate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of saving bits and pieces . ( And it was , as the Israeli Embassy later told me , right on the mark . ) The result was extraordinary : I was attacked more violently in the Polish press than any nonofficial American in years . Being attacked in a Communist press is a serious matter . It usually means that something is about to be done to someone ; in the old days , it meant that someone was about to go out of style , if not sight . In my own case I think they were debating whether to expel me and , in the meantime , rubbed it in a little extra , so that I would either capitulate and become cooperative , or that I would be so effectively isolated from the society that it would n't matter . There were at least fifteen attacks , perhaps more . They were bitter , personal , insulting , even venal . The government was particularly upset because the story was widely reprinted in Israel , where they know whether or not the shoe fits . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us wait the required thirty days after an earlier waiver . Then when the thirty days were up , they still refused us the right to marry . " We must now check whether or not Miss Tchizevska was married in another country , " the official noted , " it may take some time . " They trotted out tame Jewish writers to make attacks . Usually in Poland anything which angers the government gladdens the population . But here it was slightly different . No one really denied it was true , but they all protested : did I know that none of the Jews who perished during the war spoke Polish ? Did I know how many Jews had been in the secret police ? And on . Finally I remember one handsome young Polish student , upper-middleclass , explaining why my story was wrong , then apologizing for my terrible treatment . The attack by Mr. Toeplitz , he said , that was a particularly bad one . " Of course , " he said , " you must remember one thing . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " is not a Polish name . " From that story on I was something of a cripple . I was not allowed any more serious mistakes . But since they finally permitted Filzbieta and me to marry ( since she was so well known , to expel me while we were trying to marry would look like an attempt to stop the marriage and bring on a scandal ) I was now in an even more difficult position . I had more reason not to want to he expelled . We had a comfortable life in a small one-room apartment , good friends , the best of both worlds . That put me in a weaker position with the government . A reporter is stronger if he does n't give a damn about being expelled , and now of course I gave more of a damn than ever . And now I was doubly sensitive about not selling out the constituency for my own visa : the impossible situation had become more impossible . . A few months later , after a spell of particularly negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foreign ministry . We were friends , he said , would I please save myself now before it was too late . Because I had been hitting them fairly hard in recent weeks and could stand to balance it a bit , I consciously looked around for something nice . By chance the next day there happened to be a local story saying that within the week there would be a major change in the style of running gas stations ; there would be increased incentive , and a percentage of the take to the manager . Service at Polish gas stations has always been a special kind of torture ; I thought , here is your positive story . So the next week , having the name and an introduction to a gas-station manager , I went out to write about gas stations . The manager was delighted to see me : an American and a newspaperman . I began to ask the obvious questions about how much better the service would be , and what percentage he would get if his service were better . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more he talked , the more puzzled I became . We were not talking about the same gas stations . Clearly the service was not going to get better at all , not one bit . In fact , if he worked diligently 72 hours a week and paid one assistant a minimal salary , he would make about what he had made in the past , a piddling slim . You mean , I said , it dawning on me finally , that you 're simply going to be able to cheat a little more ? He nodded and smiled : he thought that was why I was there in the first place , that I had come for a lesson in how to steal . At this point he gave me a marvelously detailed lesson in how he stole and worked it out with the state drivers , a system which has its counterpart in almost every form of Polish daily life . Let us say the state driver comes in and orders ten gallons ; the manager would give the driver five and a receipt for ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . The driver would pay the manager for , say , seven , thereby making a profit of three himself . The manager , however , would have extra money for the five gallons he sold , plus the extra gas to sell to someone else . He showed me how he kept his elaborate calculations on a vinyl glass so he could know at any moment how much he really had in case the inspectors came , and how much money he must show in the register . This way , though living dangerously ( there was an extraordinary turnover in gas-station managers ) he could increase his wage something like 1,000 per cent . And the inspectors ? I asked . Do n't worry about the inspectors , he said . They all come in pairs and they always look alike . You can spot them . From time to time there are average citizens who come and I am careful because they have the misfortune to look like the inspectors . But there are never inspectors who look like the average citizens . I left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more story which would get me in trouble . The reporter learns to live like a Pole , perhaps even think like a Pole : the business of getting up on a gray and dark day thinking dark thoughts about life and how difficult it is , and then going on and making the best he can of it , to savor what pleasures there are , to ignore as best he can the
