 | How to Chop Like a Champ The underhand chop : fastest way to cut a felled log Adept southpaw , Geer shows his racing form ( hand positions would be reversed by righthanders ) . He has hacked footsteps on braced log , crayoned target-line X. Unseen notch has already been cut at rear . In photo 2 , note hand whipping down handle , bent knees . He breathes out explosively at instant of impact ( 3 ) . Chipfreeing stroke , from other face of notch , shears off full-width chip . Alternate strokes continue until ( in last , unnumbered photo ) final stroke bites through . HOW fast can a wood chopper chop ? If he happens to be Dave Geer , he can sever a two-by-six in one stroke , fell a fair-size tree with two strokes , and slice through a 12-inch log in 16 seconds . Five-time winner of wood-chopping 's top award , the North American World Championship , and holder of more than 50 other chopping trophies , he ranks as one of the all-time greats with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man of average build , he looks to he in his early 20s , and might tip the scales at about 160 . Actually , he 's 36 , father of four , head of Norwich . Connecticut 's , $250,000 Geer Construction Co. , and weighs in at 190 . I watched him slash through a 16-inch hard-oak log in 45 seconds , twice as fast as I 'd ever seen it done before . I asked him how he does it . The trick , he explained , is in realizing that accuracy comes first , power second . If you can land your blade precisely where you want it and at the angle you want it , stroke after stroke , you can easily outchop a far stronger man whose aim wanders . The explanation is logical : Drive your blade exactly into the cut of the previous stroke or perfectly in line to extend it , and you get maximum ' cut depth and length out of each stroke . Miss the cut or hit out of line . and you literally start over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of an expert chopper by the surface of the severed log end ? handsaw-smooth if he 's in the top ranks . Bad aim leaves a telltale hand-hewn look . Once you 've mastered precision , put everything you 've got into the power of your wallop , but never sacrifice accuracy . Geer says good marks-@#  | men generally make good wood choppers , and to prove it he has almost as many prizes for rifle shooting as for chopping . Chopping style and axe patterns , he feels , are strictly an individual matter . You 'll chop best with an axe you enjoy handling and with the kind of swing that comes easily to you . But Geer 's general technique and choice of axes provide about as good a guide as you can use . The underhand chop is the method required in most competition . Geer , a former contract logger , says it 's the best way to chop , whether on a championship log or a felled tree in your back yard . You stand on top of the log , feet well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then from the other to sever the log when the notches meet . ( In contests. the logs are made uniform either by being sawed square or by being latheturned to size ? 14-inch alder in U.S. Championships , 15-inch black eucalyptus in Australia. ) @# @#  | On hardwood Geer uses a 5-pound long-handled axe with about a 5%-inch cutting edge . On softwood he uses a 6-to-8-pound short-handled axe with a 7-inch cutting edge . These " racing axes " are specially made by Emerson &; Stevens Manufacturing Co. , of Oakland , Mc. , by a process that welds an extra-hard cutting edge to a head of softer steel . The handles , tailored to order , come from the 90-year-old Tatem Manufactur ing Co. , of Eastford , Conn . For everyday back-yard chopping , his choice is a " Connecticut-pattern " axe with a 28-inch handle ? a good bet for the average chopper . The long-handled axe stroke starts with the axe overhead , left hand gripping the handle end , right hand about three inches under the axe head , if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the handle to accelerate axe-head velocity as the stroke progresses . When the blade @#  | lands at the end of the stroke , hands are crowded together at the handle end . Do it right and you 'll sink a well-sharpened axe at least two inches into hard oak . The short-handled stroke also starts overhead , but omits the sliding hand action , maintaining the hands-together grip from start to finish . In either stroke , the expert breathes in as he raises his axe , and exhales almost explosively ( you can hear the snort ) as he brings it down , giving him full flexibility amidships . This breathing rhythm is a point worth copying by the back-yard chopper . Another contest measure that will improve your axe work : Mark out the cut with crayon or chalk before you start . It 's easier to hit a line if there 's a line to hit . Two cutting angles figure in Geer 's chopping . The cutting stroke enters the wood at about 45 degrees . The chipping stroke , swung into the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wedging action shears the intervening wood along the grain , breaking it free in chips as heavy as four pounds . Sharpening an axe is an art about which every champion has a few secrets of his own . Basically , Geer starts by roughing his cutting edge to shape with a file , rocking it slightly to form a convex-sided bevel ? never a fragile flat or hollow-sided one . Ile then smooths the roughed-out edge with a power grinder . Finally , he dresses it razor-keen with a fine hand whetstone . He leaves no visible scratches to provide chip-prone weak points in the hard steel . At all chopping events he carries a pocket whetstone for an important reason : Slide it along each side of the cutting edge and if you hear a faint click there 's a depression in the thin section , often too small to see . Work it out in a minute or two with the whetstone and your axe is as good as new for the next heat . Neglect it and it not only impedes the cut but grows larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to learn to use an axe , still more to be a contest  | winner , and plenty more to hit the championships . Geer , for example , cho better than 500 practice logs a year . Bt it 's a popular sport in all timber country In Australia , where it got its official start 75 years ago , it has reached baseha proportions . Major chopping events a held in a 65,000-seat stadium where 1 year 's championships packed in a million and a quarter people in eight day A champion comes through . If you feel like trying some competition in country fair wood-chop , do n't let people talk you out of it just because you do n't look like a lumberjack . You may surprise them , as Geer did some years ago in New Hampshire , when he was pitted against a six-foot , four-inch local champ who carried 275 pounds of solid muscle . This awesome adversary vaulted to the stage in a single panther leap and smashed through a 10-inch alder log in 44 seconds while the crowd went wild . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guffaws and the bellowed comment that the contest was for men not boys . But he sheared through In , matching log in 22 seconds , just half the giant 's time , and the fans brought do ; the house . With plenty of practice you may win the first contest you enter , as Geer did at 21 . If you do , you 'll probably never quit . He does n't plan to . But if you do n't win , you ca n't really lose . Your practice logs will keep you in firewood and the chips make fine kindling .
