The L-Shaped Room . The plot is frayed from use and old age , the characters are mostly Characters , and the sound track turns on a spigot marked Brahms to cue every tender moment . But L-Shaped Room shrugs off these shortcomings to become a beautiful and refreshing film . Part of the credit goes to Director Bryan Forbes ( Whistle Down the Wind ) , whose screenplay honestly makes the unwed-motherhood story a low-key masterpiece of candor and sensitivity . A larger share goes to Leslie Caron ; she plays not a girl who " got into trouble " but a young woman of remarkable dignity who , after a loveless weekend affair , chooses the less convenient road . Faced with the insinuating soft sell of an abortionist , she decides to have her baby and go it alone . <P> But there is respite to her loneliness : in the grubby lodging house where she creeps to wait out her time , she meets a penniless young writer ( Tom Bell ) and falls in love . Leslie lives in a dingy cubbyhole under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger room by a flimsy partition ; beyond this wall lives a Negro musician ( Brock Peters ) . For a while Leslie manages to keep the fact of her pregnancy from her lover . But the musician , eaten with jealousy , tells him that he has heard her being sick in the mornings . Secrets are hard to keep in an L-shaped room when , on the other side of the partition , someone is lying awake , listening . <P> The L-Shaped Room marks Leslie Caron 's successful transition from gamin to grownup . Her love scenes with hawk-faced Tom Bell are vivid ; her way of mumbling silently to herself in moments of despair evokes such heartbreak that viewers will want to hug her and say , there , there , everything will be all right . There is a taste of Honey and an aftertaste of Anger about The L-Shaped Room that give it an honorable place among British slice-of-life films .
