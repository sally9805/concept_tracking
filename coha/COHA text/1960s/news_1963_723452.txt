" The court evidently found Jerry Re something of an anachronism and this may possibly have played a part in assessing the degree of his culpability . Judge Bonsai at one point said to him : " It does seem to me that you as a specialist have violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Stock Exchange but I have in mind also that you came up through a hard school and I 'm fully aware many things ds fully aware many things then with impunity are now considered criminal acts . " Guterma Got 5 Years Peter H. Morrison , Assistant ; United States Attorney , who tried the case , and Ira H. Pearce , investigator of the Securities and Exchange Commission who spent several years doing research on the Res , pointed out the comparative severity of other sentences in recent stock fraud cases .

Vandersee eight years and $5,000 in New Jersey , 1959 . Re Shunned Flight Yesterday , for the first time , the Res spoke out in court . Jerry Re asserted that " an avalanche , a disaster " would have hit the financial community if he had followed the wishes of Lowell M. Birrell , fugitive financier now in Brazil , who was named as a codefendant . Re asserted that he and his son " went through the whole ' rigmarole " of an S.E.C. inquiry in 1957 " and nothing wrong was found . " Gerard Re stated : could undoubtedly have made my way to Brazil if I 'd been so inclined but I was n't . I never conspired with Birrell or anyone else . " Each of the Res spoke in strained , loud tones , seeking to impress the court with their innocence . Judge Bonsai , in contrast , replied softly , giving a capsule comment on each defendant in turn before imposing sentence . " It is true that the leader in the conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re . ' he is beyond reach of this court and I have in mind that on the other hand , Mr. Re , you are guilty in your own right for what youdid . " To Gerard Re , 40 , Judge Bonsai said : " I 've had difficulty with you . True , ' your father was brought up in a hard school but you were not . True , there may be some ? extenuating circumstances in your own conscience but not under the law . " The court told Grande , 68 , " I see no indication that you took any part in the securities business . I see a substantial difference in your position . " The case against Grande , a onetime horse trainer , was that he permitted his name to be used on a dummy account for unloading nearly 500,000 shares of Swan-Finch stock , Batkin , the judge observed , presented the most difficult problem of all . " I 've received a great many letters from your neighbors and friends attesting to your activity in the community ( of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Your business career is perfectly appalling to me . In some ways your offense is graver than any of the others because you where just looking for a fast buck . " Finally , Judge Bonsai turned to Jacob Yaffee , 61 , an accountant by profession who turned broker . " Your great mistake , as far as I can see , was in getting into the brokerage business in the first place , " the court noted . " You were all right as an accountant but no good as a broker . Your poor health is a strong motivation in the sentence you will receive . " The trial grew out of complaints received by the S.E.C. about five years ago . They concerned the peculiar behavior of a number of securities listed on the American Stock Exchange and the way the names of the Res , father and son , kept turning up in a significant manner . Both the Res were suspend-ed from trading activities in May , 1960 , and expelled from ' the Exchange , a year later . They were indicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
