" I 'm only a little Hebe who was brought up in the gutters of Brooklyn , " Millionaire Joseph Herman Hirshhorn , 66 , likes to say in moments of wry self-depreciation . But every inch that the 5-ft. 4-in. dynamo lacks in physical stature , he has more than made up for in wealth : his fortune , based on Canadian uranium , has grown to upwards of $100 million . Nor is there any gainsaying his voracious appetite for art . " I buy art almost every day , " he says . " If I ca n't decide which of an artist 's work , I buy them all . " <P> In 35 years of serving himself gargantuan portions , Hirshhorn has gathered some 5,600 works of art . They overflow his 24-room , 24-acre estate atop Round Hill in Greenwich , Conn. , are crammed into the closets of his New York apartment , and accumulate in warehouses . His sculptures alone total 1,600 , including 17 Rodins , 53 Henry Moores ( the largest collection anywhere ) . <P> Up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally rich-and heavily weighted toward Americans . Thomas Eakins , for instance , is represented in a quantity surpassed only by the Philadelphia Museum of Art . He has kept up with recent op and pop trends , owns 30 early and late works by Larry Rivers . His bet for future fame : Willem de Kooning , of whose works he owns 42 . " If ever I have a museum , " he once vowed , " I 'm going to have a De Kooning room . " <P> With such a wealth of art , a favorite guessing game on three continents has been : Who will get the collection ? London 's Tate Gallery offered to build a museum in Regent 's Park to house it . Israel was willing to match all offers ; so was Zurich , Switzerland . At home , Los Angeles wanted the collection for its new museum ; Governor Nelson Rockefeller wanted it for New York State ; the Baltimore museum offered to build a separate wing . Hirshhorn himself at various times was rumored to be alternately considering turning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete new town in Canada , to be called Hirshhorn , and donating his whole collection to his namesake city . <P> Belonging to the People . In the end , even the White House became interested . A year ago , Lyndon Johnson invited Hirshhorn to lunch , suggested that he consider giving it to Washington . In August , Lady Bird and Lynda Bird made a two-hour visit to Hirshhorn 's Greenwich home and outdoor sculpture garden , returned with ecstatic reports . Finally , it was the call of country that won out . Said Hirshhorn : " This collection does n't belong to one man ; it belongs to the people . " The news was too good to be kept quiet for long . Last week word of his decision leaked to the press ; this week the President will make it official . <P> Plans for a building to house Hirshhorn 's art must await congressional action , but there is little chance that Congress will turn down such a princely gesture . Most likely spot will be an area adjacent to the National Gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of an outdoor sculpture garden that would extend across the three-block width of the Mall , be available to millions of tourists .
