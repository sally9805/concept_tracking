txt Congress has finally found a vehicle for debating Vietnam , and President Johnson , who has appeared reluctant to encourage such a debate , is partly responsible . The Vietnam issue will be aired in public hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under the chairmanship of Sen. J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , who opposed the resumption of North Vietnam bombing . Last week , the committee brought Secretary of State Dean Rusk before it and publicly questioned him sharply for four hours on the authority under which President Johnson is operating . Many senators who are restive over developments in Vietnam but who have been unwilling to challenge them directly are glad to approach the matter obliquely over an issue which Mr. Johnson has himself raised . Resolution recalled When a group of 16 Democratic senators signed a letter of Sen. Birch Bayh ( D ) of Indiana to the President , urging him to take further consultation before resuming bombing in North Vietnam , Mr. Johnson answered tartly , and with a brevity bordering on brusqueness . He repeated what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has all the authority he requires , based on a near-unanimous resolution of support , passed by Congress Aug. 7 , 1964 . Some senators who support Mr. Johnson 's foreign policy are irritated by what they regard as a high-handed use of this resolution as a " blank check " for conditions that have greatly changed since 1964 . An American destroyer was fired upon in the Gulf of Tonkin on Aug. 2 , 1964 , and Mr. Johnson asked Congress to support him in taking counteractions . Congress responded instantly , giving him full authority " to take all necessary steps " in Vietnam . Chairman Fulbright , who sponsored the resolution , now says it was a mistake . Mr. Johnson 's short reply to the Bayh letter pricked the pride of a number of senators who feel it is time to seek a larger hand in what is transpiring . Long war seen Many see the Vietnam struggle turning into a long war . Sen. John Stennis ( D ) of Mississippi , a strong advocate of action and ranking member of the Armed Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , call-up of reserves , commitment of as many as 600,000 American troops , and possible use of nuclear weapons . Sen. George D. Aiken of Vermont , senior Republican in the Senate , told the Senate the nation is kidding itself about the war , and that it may require " universal conscription , " increased taxation , wage and price controls , and perhaps ration cards . He was one of the five senators who signed the Mansfield report on the near futility of the war . Sen. Jacob K. Javits ( R ) of New York takes the same position . Congress has a supplemental request for nearly $13 billion for defense , together with a $415 million supplemental foreign-aid request . The latter will be the vehicle on which the Senate committee will conduct hea rings . The congressional mood is undergoing a change , it appears . Mansfield report It began with the report of ? Majority Leader Mike Mansfield ( D ) of Montana that the Vietnam struggle is an open-ended conflict . Without saying so the report indicated an indefinite struggle , with incalculable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gird itself , the President 's rebuff of the Bayh group , his decision to resume bombing , the international debate before the United Nations , the interrogation of Secretary Rusk , and a two-hour discussion on the Senate floor , Jan. 31 . Now come public hearings of invited witnesses with full national publicity . . Uneasiness in the Senate seems to crystallize around Mr. Johnson 's use of the " blank-check " resolution . Some feel that the nation deserves more information on American political objectives . Mr. Johnson has tried to damp down congressional debates . it is felt , doubtless due to a fear that any show of division might give comfort to the enemy . Following a meeting here last week of state Republican leaders , a change of attitude within the party was reported . " It is the hard , practical Republican view that the Democrats must be given plenty of leeway to sink into a political quagmire , " according to the Baltimore Sun .                  @ @ @
