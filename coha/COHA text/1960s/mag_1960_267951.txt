The Virgin Spring ( Svensk Filmindustri : Janus ) , the latest work of Ingmar Bergman ( TIME , March 14 ) , is a violently beautiful miracle play , an apocalyptic parable in which good and evil , Christian and pagan powers collaborate in a divine rebirth , the continuous nativity of love . <P> Derived from a ghastly-lovely medieval ballad ( Tres dotter i Vnge ) , the film tells the story of two sisters , one dark ( Gunnel Lindblom ) and one fair ( Birgitta Pettersson ) , one serving Wotan and the other Christ , one sunk in nature and the other lost in light . The dark sister hates the fair sister , and one morning , when the two girls ride together through the forest to bring candles to the village church , the dark sister secretly opens the fair sister 's bread and slips a toad inside . Then , in the depths of the forest , she turns back and lets her sister go on alone . <P> Soon the fair sister meets three hungry goatherds . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps out . " The herdsmen three , " the ballad continues , " took her to wife/ And then from her they took her life. / Her body in the mire they lay/ And with her garments went away . " That night the murderers take shelter at a farmhouse , unaware that the farm belongs to the father ( Max von Sydow ) of their victim . When they offer to sell him the girl 's garments , he slaughters them like the animals they are . Then he rushes through the forest to his daughter 's corpse . <P> " God ! " the father cries aloud , wrenching his face to heaven , " you saw it ! The death of the innocent child and my revenge . You allowed it ! I do n't understand you . " In despair and atonement he vows to build a church of stone with his own hands on the spot where his daughter died . " I know no other way to be reconciled with my own hands . I know no other way to live . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the daughter 's head . The father-and the Wotan-worshiping sister-fall on their knees to receive the miraculous water of life . <P> This holy and horrible Gothic tale can not of course be understood as a story of real men and women in real situations . <P> Like the ballad that inspired it . The Virgin Spring is a myth , and as a myth it is treated in this film . Bergman 's style , usually subtle and allusive , is startlingly simple . The script , written under Bergman 's supervision by Novelist Ulla Isaksson , who also did the screenplay for Brink of Life , is as clear and grave as a Mass . The actors , as always finely disciplined by Bergman , behave as formally as acolytes . The photography is as beautiful as it generally is in Bergman 's pictures , but if anything more plain-there are very few cute shots to catch the eye . In the European version of the film the scenes of rape and murder are direct , unmitigated , appalling . In the U.S. version the scenes are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result they tease the imagination instead of smiting the heart . The damage to the film is serious , considerably diminishing the moral impact of Bergman 's principal point : the way to God lies through the valley of the shadow of death , and in that valley all men tremble .
