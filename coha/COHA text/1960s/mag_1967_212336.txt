Ever since he came to power in 1965 , Rumania 's Communist Party Secretary-General Nicolae Ceausescu , 49 , has been losing patience with his older , more doctrinaire and often incompetent party colleagues . Steadily , Ceausescu ( TIME cover , March 18 , 1966 ) strengthened his position in the government and gathered younger and more liberal men around him . Last week , at a national party conference in Bucharest , he finally threw off the mantle of Rumania 's " collective leadership " and took over the presidency himself . He also did away with " parallel " party and government jobs at the local level , reshuffled the Rumanian hierarchy and put some of the Old Guard out to pasture . Among the losers was Ceausescu 's only challenger for power in the past , ex-Police Chief Alexandru Draghici , who was dropped as a Party Secretary and became one of several deputy premiers . <P> Ceausescu no doubt wanted the presidency partly because it would give him more stature when traveling abroad . It would also make it easier for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Moscow 's orbit and toward closer ties with the West , and last week publicly criticized Russia for hampering trade relations in retaliation for Rumania 's independent stance .
