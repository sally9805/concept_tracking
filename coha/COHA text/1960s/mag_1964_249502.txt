Children poured into the playground and found two jet planes , a tank and three trolleys , an 1870 locomotive , a Coast Guard tug , an amphibious craft , a fire engine , a Marine obstacle course and a soapbox racing track .

But the most inspired idea cost nothing : to ask the armed forces to donate some obsolete tanks , planes , and ships . They happily complied .

A big draw at the Penn Valley playground in Kansas City , Mo. , is a magnificent woodpile composed of a series of tree trunks embedded in concrete under sand to form an intricate jungle gym .

The town of Warner Robins , Georgia , for instance , has constructed a new 13-unit obstacle course of slides and balance beams , installed a couple of whirl merry-go-rounds.
