 | WHAT IS a NERVOUS BREAK DOWN An ATTRACTIVE young couple moved to our suburban town from another state . They had two small children , and were expecting a third . The husband commuted to the city , leaving early and not returning home until the evening . The mother 's day was filled with endless errands , house hold chores and the care of two frisky youngsters . Gradually the stresses of her life began to take their toll . Her moods swung from to brittle gaiety , and back again . One minute she would sit staring dully out the window , the next slit . would be frantically cleaning the garage or attic . One morning as she prepared for a shopping trip she suddenly dreaded going downtown , into streets and stores . Her heart pounded . The dread rapidly spiraled into panic . On the verge of hysteria , she phoned her husband and begged him to hurry home . He found her locked in a bedroom , weeping ... . Not long ago , a brilliant young advertising man 1 know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious wife was delighted . Ile , . %i  | however , felt just the opposite . Underneath , he did n't want the increased responsibility . But how could he admit it ? Everyone would think him weak . He grew moody and depressed . He had trouble sleeping . One spring day his gaze traveled out the open window of his 9th-floor office . Slowly he froze with horror . The space , the languid air outside , seemed to beckon him . He stared in terrible fascination at the open window , struggling with an almost overpowering impulse to jump . A jangling phone came to his rescue . He stumbled from the office and took a taxi 40 miles home . He called his doctor and went to bed ... . Doctors used psychiatric terms to describe these different illnesses . But the term that seemed to satisfy relatives and friends was more general . They called both cases " nervous breakdown . " Most of us would say the same . Just what is a nervous breakdown ? Since nerve tissue never mechanically snaps , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity ? Several doctors I talked with dismissed it as a " vague catchall . " Other authorities defend it . The main reason for the term 's usefulness , doctors are coming to understand , is that all nervous breakdowns have certain elements in common . The core of the nervous breakdown is anxiety , a condition of heightened tension accompanied by an overpowering feeling of apprehension without apparent reason . We all have anxieties . Their causes are usually forgotten . But the duplication of a once-frightening circumstance may call these nameless fears from the depths of our unconscious mind to fill us with baffling dread and terror . I once knew a newspaperman who broke down on the death of his mother . Psychotherapy uncovered a long-buried terror that he 'd felt as a child whenever his parents had left him alone in the house . When his mother died and " left him behind " once more , it had all swept hack with crushing force . Another common element in all breakdowns is the failure of defense mechanisms . Early in life most of us learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most common defense mechanism is rationalization . A man rationalizes his heavy drinking by telling himself that he 's just being sociable , for example . Another technique is " displacement . " Here the upsetting emotions we feel toward one person are concealed by working them off on another . For instance , a salesman hates his boss but ca n't admit it , so he picks fights with his wife . Other methods of warding off anxiety include denial , a blind refusal to admit that problems exist ; and repression , an unconscious but purposeful " forgetting . " Sometimes defense mechanisms perform more or less effectively for a lifetime . But frequently , when tensions and fears pile up overwhelmingly , the defense mechanisms fail and the underlying anxiety bursts through . It is then that the person  | " breaks down " into helplessness . In our stressful society , this is happening with disturbing frequency . All breakdowns have a common denominator : the man ca n't go to work ( or the housewife ca n't keep house ) . But they are rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . " If anything is typical , " one doctor told me , " it is that a nervous breakdown is the end result of a gradual decline taking place over weeks , or even months . It is a progressive inability to cope with anxiety . And the warning symptoms ? the distress signals ? are clearly visible , all along the way . " All breakdowns are caused by stress ? often physical and social as well as mental . There is a limit to human tolerance of stress , and every man has his breaking point . If mild physical strain ( such as lack of sleep ) is added to a severe neurosis ? or if very heavy physical and social strain ( such as overwork and family trouble ) is added to a minor mental stress ? an individual may break down . How he breaks will in large part be determined by his underlying psychological weaknesses . How CAN we tell when we are heading for trouble ? The first sign is generally a prolonged feeling of being vaguely unwell , " below par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying physical ailments : tenseness , restlessness , persistent fatigue , insomnia . We may develop more crippling symptoms : severe headaches , palpitation of the heart , dizziness , gastrointestinal disorders , muscular pains . These symptoms serve a purpose , according to Dr. Francis J. Braceland of the Hartford ( Conn . ) Institute of Living . They give us an excuse to avoid stressful situations ? a noisy party , a difficult conference , an appointment with someone with whom we are on falsely amiable terms . A warning symptom more readily apparent to others than to ourselves is a marked change in personality ? either an intensification of a character trait or an abrupt reversal in behavior . A shy person may become more shy ; an outgoing person may become exuberant and rattle on endlessly about unrealistic schemes . On the other hand , a person who has been neat and orderly all his life may grow careless and slovenly . The important fact is the change itself . If the emotional disturbance develops unchecked , the next step may well be the breaking point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , authorities agree , particularly if the disturbance is recognized and resolved in its early stages . Says Dr. Alan A. McLean , staff psychiatrist for International Business Machines Corp. , " In most instances , changes in behavior occur quite early in the development of an emotional illness . The altered behavior pattern usually affects the individual on the job . The alert foreman or manager may be able to detect it . If the patient obtains immediate treatment , he can usually straighten out his problems without ; r , 771E RI AI ) ER5 1 ) IGIiST  | prolonged time off from work . " Once a breakdown occurs , recovery depends on the complexity and depth of the disturbance , the patient 's desire to get well and the adequacy of treatment . In the case of the advertising man who was promoted to vice president , a few ( lays of rest and self-appraisal and a long talk with his family doctor opened his eyes to the necessity of asking for his old job back ? and he was cured . A dozen interviews with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , enabled the housewife to meet her problems more maturely . Most breakdowns can be " cured . " But it is better not to have one in the first place . So if we recognize in ourselves symptoms that are making us , or others , unhappy , we should seek immediate help . A good place to start is the family doctor or clergyman . In the early stages of emotional trouble , a candid talk with a sympathetic listener may he all we need . As individuals , we might try to handle better the stresses of life . Says Dr. John Donnelly of the Institute of Living , " Every problem of frustration which is faced realistically and dealt with in an organized way adds to the strength of the personality . Every failure from which a lesson has been learned provid both an experience and an ass which increases our capacity to meet new problems . " When stress is unavoidable , N can give ourselves a break by keeping it simple . If we 're starting o on a new and unfamiliar job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we find that were getting wound up over a worrisor problem . the best thing to do is take time out ? sec a movie , go aw for the week-end -- and come back to the problem with a relaxed min In work and in play , we must t to recognize our limitations . A writer once told me , " The most imps tans day of my life was the day stopped trying to set the world fire , and accepted myself ? the go and the bad , the strength and t weaknesses ? for what I was . 1 ' been a happier man , a more understanding father and a more useful citizen ever since . " These seem like little things , as they are . But they help us accept truth that may have been hard learn as children -- -that there is not ing , really , to be afraid of . As learn this , we grow in faith , we grow in strength and , most important , grow in our capacity to love .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
