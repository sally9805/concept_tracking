PART TWO " I have n't asked you the most important ques  --  tion of all , " I said to Princess Grace . " How did you meet Prince Rainier ? I 've been told that the time was 1955 , when you visited Cannes for the annual film festival , but I 'd like to hear your version . " She said , " Pierre Galante , one of the edi  --  tors of Pans Match  --  he 's married to Olivia de Havilland  --  asked me if I would go to Monaco so he could make a picture story of my visit for his magazine . He was anxious for me to meet Prince Rainier . He promised to make the arrangements . I said I 'd be happy to if I had the time . " " Is it true , " I asked , " that if you 'd had more time you would have chosen another dress instead of the one you wore ? Somebodytold me you were unhappy afterward because your dress had a strong floral design which seemed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is the word for it , I 've heard also that you had to rush your hairdo so frantically that when you took off for Monaco from Cannes in a car , you still had a towel wrapped around your head . " " It was hectic , " she admitted . " I had had a press conference that morning in Cannes with hordes of newspapermen and I spent the morn  --  ing talking and posing for pictures ; then , at the end of that session , somebody said , ' We have to go to Monaco at once ! ' ? It 's impossible , ' I said . ' I ca n't . ' For one thing , my entry in the film festival was being shown that evening ; so the whole thing seemed madly out of the question . Also I was a little put out that no one had told me sooner that this was the day to go to Monaco . But some  --  how I did it . There was no time to have lunch ; I just got dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse , our car had an ac  --  cident on the way , but we made it in time . " It did n't sound quite like a springboard for romance , but I waited for her to go on . " I met the prince , " she said . " And we wan  --  dered around the palace and the palace gar  --  dens . Then there was another dash back to Cannes , where the American representativesto the film festival were holding a reception that evening , and I was to be in the receiving line I had to shake hands with fifteen hundred people . After the reception I myself gave a dinner party l'or ten people , and after that my film was screened . To wind things up , Para  --  mount gave a party for me which ended at four o'clock in the morning . All in all , it was a pretty wild day ; but as hectic as it was , it was the most important day in my life , for one of the people I met that day was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interesting to get somebody else 's version of that meeting . I had been told that Father Tucker . the palace chaplain and pastor of the Church of St. Charles in Monte Carlo , was popularly re  --  garded as a white-haired , rubicund cupid in canonicals who helped bring about the en  --  gagement of Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly , so I spent an unhurried afternoon in Father Tucker 's study while he told me the story of his part in the betrothal . " I had never met Grace Kelly at the time she dropped in at the palace when she happened to be in Cannes for the 19.55 Film Festival , " he said . " As she has probably told you , her visit with the prince and to the palace was arranged by the Paris news-photographic magazine , Match . " ( Continued on Page 93 ) He chuckled as he said , " At that time everybody was marrying the prince to somebody , The press kept making lovely nominations for the next Monegasque princess . For sonic reason the notion had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matchmaker . One paper even came out with a headline which asked , IS FATHER TUCKER PLANNING TO MARRY THE PRINCE Or MONACO TO THE POPE 'S Ntece ? I was surprised at that , and I was n't the only one surprised . I was questioned about that from on high in Rome . I replied that I did n't even know the Pope had a niece . " As for Grace 's first meeting with Prince Rainier at the palace , " he went on , " he called me here at my rectory on the phone the evening they met and he said , ' I 've met somebody . I think she is the one. ? " I 'm afraid that involves us in a clich ? , " I told him . Father Tucker looked at me inquiringly . " Love at first sight , " 1 said . He nodded . " I do n't see how you can work your way out of that , " he said . " Al  --  though , as far as I knew , at that point it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prince . Anyway , I asked him , ' Who is she ? ' and he said , ' Take it easy , father , It 's Grace Kelly. ? " Why ' take it easy ' ? " I asked . " That was meant to offset any objec  --  tion on my part because she was a movie star , but he did n't need to tell me that . I said to him , ' My lord prince , I 've never met her , but 1 know of her and of her Philadelphia family , and she 's just the kind of girl I 've been wanting you to marry ! ' He replied , maybe a little tensely , ' You 'll have to help me . Come up and see me . ' I did , and we talked things over . Be  --  tween their first meeting and their next one , which took place on Christmas night , 1955 , the prince had no communi  --  cation with Grace Kelly . However , I did some writing . " He placed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church-roof line and said , " I expressed my regrets that I was n't there when shecalled and I thanked her for letting the prince see at first hand what an American Catholic girl could be like . After a short delay I got an answer . It said that she hoped to see me the next time she came to Monte Carlo . That was very flattering , but what was more impor  --  tant , it left the door open for the renewal of the friendship between those two . With that door open even a bit , 1 felt that something could be accomplished . 1 got in touch with the Kelly family indirectly and 1 arranged a trip for the prince to visit the United States with me in November . " I had an official reason for returning to the United States , " Father Tucker went on . " I was going back to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of professing my religious vows . The celebration was to take place at St. Anthony 's in Wilming  --  ton , a church I had founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of order  --  since 1 was the prince 's chap  --  lain  --  for him to accompany me as my friend as well as my temporal lord . We arrived in the United States well ahead of my anniversary . On Christmas Eve the prince assisted me at Mass at my church , and then we went to Philadelphia to visit the Kelly family , a visit which had been arranged in advance . " I knew that the prince was already set in his choice , but it was only after I came to know Grace Kelly that I discovered that she had also experienced the same coup de foudre he had  --  that 's what the French call a bolt of lightning . But she felt that the whole thing was impossible , just as her family doubted its possibility . " " Why did everyone think it so impos  --  sible ? " L asked . " Partly because very few people in America really knew the prince , " Father Tucker told me . " There were sonic who mistakenly thought him an impecunious person of title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich girl . It did n't happen in the case of Prince Rainier . The head people at Metro  --  Goldwyn-Mayer , the studio to whom Grace Kelly was under contract , had the same idea . My answer to them was . ' If you boys need a little money , I think the prince can lend you all you want . ' " " You mean he 's very wealthy in his own right ? " 1 asked . " Very , " Father Tucker assured me , " through private inheritance from his own family , aside from any income he de  --  rives as the sovereign of Monaco , which is highly satisfactory and is tax-free . Any  --  how , when Grace and Prince Rainier met again , l can only compare the attitudes to that of two diffident high-school kids . " " Both shy ? " I asked . " Very , " he told me . " So much so that I had to push him a little  --  because he was n't one hundred per cent familiar with American ways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurdle he had to overcome was the question of going to a New Year 's dance . The prince was timid because he did n't know how to go about it . This will seem silly to you , since in America all a boy has to do is ask a girl to go to a dance with him , and she says ' yes ' or ' no . ' If , however , you are a reign  --  ing European prince , you 've never done it that way , because it means you run the risk of a possible refusal  --  and that is not the way such things are managed in royal circles . So I went to Grace and said , ' Look here , little girl , if he asks you , you ca n't refuse ; for after all , he 's a prince sovereign . So what do you say ? Shall he ask you or sha n't he ? ' She said , ' If he asks me. go . ' I reported back to the prince , ' It 's fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , ' I told him , ' you 'll have to ask her just the same . ' " ' Is that the way it 's done ? ' he in  --  quired . ' In this country , yes , ' I told him . But because of the way things developed during the days immediately following Christmas , they did n't go to that New Year 's dance . That week the prince was a guest in the Kelly home , and they saw much of each other . As for me , I did a disappearing act until he came to me and told me they had decided to be married and would I please talk to Mr. Kelly about it . " Mr. Kelly said , ' Father , all we know about this boy is your word that he will be a satisfactory son-in-law . ' I said , ' I would n't recommend any boy to any girl if I did n't know him inside and out . I have been with this boy for seven years , and I know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is perfect , but he is a Fine boy . ' I knew his wonderful qualities and his deep religious convictions  --  although , of course , he was human and a youth like any other youth . The trouble was that his life had been complicated by the feet that being a prince , anything he did was mag  --  nified by the press a hundred times . " Father Tucker did the church-roof trick with his fingers again and said , " Later , when journalists like Art Buch  --  wald asked me , ' Have you been a match  --  maker ? ' I told him , ' Of course , every priest is . ' I meant that all of us give what can be called marriage counsel at the drop of a hint . Another writer asked me , ' What do you know about love , father ? ' I said , ' I 've never played football , but I know how to referee the game . Even a priest can learn a lot from the side lines . ' But to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. Kelly and to Grace herself , intimately . " I looked at him expectantly , but he shook his head , " I wo n't go into what we discussed , " he said . " It was strictly con  --  fidential , but as any father and mother would , they wanted to go into the matter very thoroughly . I remember John Kelly 's saying to me , ' Father , let 's get this le .. ? n ? ? ? ? 1111 . ? ST straight ; we are not running after roy  --  alty , and my saying to him , ' No , John , royalty 's running after you . ' I explained to him just what type of royalty it was who was asking admission to the Kelly family , because frankly John Kelly is SO thoroughly American , with a capital A , that f was n't sure he knew the difference between a prince of Monaco and a prince of Morocco . " Father Tucker added , " For example , the Kellys wanted to know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What did the prince 's family think ? " I asked . " They were anxious to see him settle down with a fine girl and become a family man . When she heard I was going to America with the prince , Prince Rainier 's mother , Princess Charlotte , gave me her blessing and said , ' Good luck to you . ' She added that all she wanted was to see her son find a girl who would really love him and whom he 'd really love . The prince 's father , Prince Pierre , wished with all his heart for his son to marry into a respectable family and keep the Gri  --  maldi line from dying out . " " Why were you sent to Monaco to be the prince 's chaplain ? " I asked him . " I 've heard that there was a feeling in Rome that religious matters were a little slack in Monaco and you were selected to tighten them up . " " The parish had fallen off a bit in faith  --  fulness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that I was sent here to gel it going along a godly path again . I guess it is also fair to say that I went about it in an American way . 1 palled around with ev  --  erybody . " " They tell me that you wore a short coat instead of a king one , " I said , " and that you started a boys ' band . " He grinned and said , " There were people here who were pretty badly puz  --  zled . There were even those who thought I was a Protestant minister . When people back home in the United States asked me how I got this assignment , I told them , ' It was very simple . Seeing that there had been a war between the French and the Italians in 1940-45 , the Holy Father thought that the best way to settle things was to send an Irishman here ; for although my father and mother were born in America , my grandparents came from Ireland . Not only that , I was given a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that way we could be a neutral balance of power . ' " I was here five months before I met the prince , " he said . " But I went about my business , just as I had done in the parish I 'd organized in Wilmington , Del  --  aware , and after a while the prince asked me if I 'd be his personal chaplain . " " Do you hold Mass in the palace chapel every Sunday ? " I asked . " It involves that , " he said . " But 1 also found that the prince was a lonely young man who invited me to lunch or go driv  --  ing with him . " For a moment he looked unhappy . " 1 did n't like that driving , " he said . " He 's a very fast driver , and he made me terribly nervous . Once he asked me , ' Am I going too fast , father ? ' and I said , ' My lord prince , i can hardly die in better company . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a St. Chris  --  topher medal in his car , but I pointed out that there was no reason to think that St. Christopher worked when he went more than sixty miles an hour , and we were do  --  ing nearly a hundred . " Father Tucker explained , " That was just his way of teasing me , for he really went out of his way to be nice to me and take me to such places as the cinema , al  --  though he never took me to the casino . There is a tradition in Monaco so strong it 's almost a law that no member of the jassuary 30 , 1960 royal household ever ventures inside the casino , but that 's no hardship to the prince . He 's not a gambling addict , " Before beginning his next sentence , he assembled his thoughts and put them in order . He said , " You know that the casino is in my parish , which creates an ethical problem as to whether gambling is morally reprehensible . As I tell the prince , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about drink . Gambling is not a sin in itself ; it is only when it is abused that it becomes a sin . That is especially so when the abuse is so keen that it becomes a ruling passion . " Before l came here I heard stories about suicides committed by people who had lost their fortunes in the casino . It may have happened , but I 'm inclined to think it a legend . In the ten years that I 've been here there 's been nothing like that . " He chuckled once more and added , " To tell you the truth , the big church built back in Wilmington was built on bingo . " What he said next I found most inter  --  esting . " What the rest of the world does n't understand is that so far as the in  --  come of the principality is concerned , gambling is insignificant . The popular notion is that Monaco depends on its take from the casino for its living . The truth is that the income from the casino represents only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tourism contributes some fifty-five per cent of the state income . Lo  --  cal industries supply between twenty-five and thirty per cent of the total in  --  come . Taxes on tobacco , liquor , regis  --  tration fees and the sale of stamps make up the rest . " The prince once said to me , ' Father , they tell me I 'm an absolute sovereign . Exactly what does that mean ? ' I said , ' My lord prince , for one thing , an abso  --  lute sovereign has the power of life anddeath over his subjects . ' The prince looked at mc , smiled wryly and said , ' Then why do n't I use it ? ' " " Did he have anybody in mind ? " I asked Father Tucker . " He may have had . " Father Tucker re  --  plied . " There arc people here who can make anybody mad . What irritates me is that the Monegasques have everything beautiful and picturesque that nature can give them . What with no military service and no income taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they should be happy . But it 's the same old story . They want more . As the Lord said , ' A man 's enemies are they of his own household . ' " The Monegasques are like a large family , " he went on . " I doubt very much if there has ever been a family in which there were not petty jealousies , hurt feel  --  ings and a belief that ' I could run this family better than anybody else if I were allowed to , ' There are about 2300 Mone  --  gasque citizens . Roughly , 900 of them are men with the right to vote , and most of those 900 arc trying to keep the vote from the women , while I think that the prince would like to give the franchise to all Monegasques , regardless of sex , " Among those nine hundred Mone  --  gasques with the vote , " Father Tucker continued , " there are some who are prin  --  cipally interested in getting what they can for themselves out of the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is , after all , a government ; and all govern  --  ments , big or small , are made up of two factions which are usually feuding  --  the ins and the outs . " He saw my next question coming and answered it before I could put it to him . " Although hack home I took part in poli  --  tics a little , I keep clear of such feuds . I come of old Democratic stock , but the time came when I leaned toward the Re  --  publican notion that George Washingtonwas right about two terms ' being enough . That got me into trouble , for when the pa  --  pers said that I had switched my political allegiance , the Irish of Wilmington 's Tenth Ward let it be known that they would rather I had become a Methodist . And after the election that year an irate female called me at two o'clock in the morning to tell me , ' You 've been at St. Anthony 's longer than F.D.R. has been in the White House . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no political ideas at all . I could n't , even if 1 wanted to ; but naturally my sympathy is all with the prince . He 's been very patient and forgiving with habitual complainers. would n't have encouraged him to go as far that way as he has , but that 's not my business either . " " How do you address Prince Rainier except ' my lord prince ' ? " I asked . " I call him ' your highness , " ' he said , " or if I 'm addressing him in French , it is permissible to call him ' monsigneur . ' " He remembered something which amused him . " The prince calls me ' father ' or ' canon , ' because he made me a canon of the cathedral here , which brings me to a little anecdote I 've always enjoyed . He told a group of cloistered nuns back in Wilmington , Delaware , ' As a Catholic prince I had the right to make Father Tucker a canon , but I assure you he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of the world , or keeping up with Current expressions , when the dear sisters wrote to their other convents to report that conversation they said , ' The prince said of Father Tucker , " I made him a canon , but he is a canon 1 will never shoot . " ' " FatherTucker grinned broadly . " The prince and I had great fun over that , " he said . " Being an absolute monarch does con  --  fer certain privileges upon the prince , does n't it ? " I said . " If a visitor makes himself disagreeable in the principality , is n't it the prince 's privilege to ask him to leave ? " " He does have that privilege , " Father Tucker admitted . " He can also call upon the French Government to back him up in excluding unwelcome persons from the department which surrounds Monaco . If you put someone out of the principal  --  ity because he has been a nuisance , he could move right across the street and continue his nonsense , for half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . That is what happened when the prince outlawed the Communists here . They retreated across the street , but the French police respected the prince 's wish not to let them stay even that near . " Next he said something I had already figured out for myself . " I have been with Prince Rainier and Princess Grace when they 've been received by nobility . Every  --  one agrees that this American girl not only seems a princess and looks like a princess , she is a princess . Through some miracle she has been given by grace what some princesses are not given by nature . " Father Tucker changed the subject and said , " One of the remarkable things about Princess Grace was the way she rose to the situation created by the fact that she did n't speak fluent French . She knew more French than most American girls , 94 for she had studied with the French Sis  --  ters of the Assumption in Philadelphia . She has proper grammar and syntax , and her pronunciation is perfect , but her vo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her memory , which was beautifully trained as part of her acting career , serves her in good stead when it comes to increasing her French vocabulary . One day she made a speech over the radio here in behalf of the refugees who had emerged from behind the Iron Curtain . After listening to her I said to the prince , ' My lord prince , did you hear our princess ' French over the radio ? ' and he said , ' Yes , what of it ? ' l saw that he was ready to battle in her defense , so all I said was , ' I think she 's doing pretty well . ' " He snapped back , ' She speaks French much better than you do . ' That was too much for me , because I 've been working at it for fifty years , so I said to him , ' My lord prince , I 've always heard that love is blind , but I 'm beginning to think it is deaf too. ? " What did he have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good fellow , " Father Tucker told me . " He just smiled and said , ' A lot you know about it. ? I was a little shy about bringing it up , but I braced myself and said it anyhow . " There 's another rumor I hear almost every week , " I said . " It 's that the princess is pregnant again . " " Yes , I hear that all the time , " he agreed . " But , after all , whose business is it ? However , I 'm asked that same question often . My answer is always , ' 1 do n't see any reason why she should n't be . It 's normal in the course of mar  --  riage . ' " " I 've heard that the Princess Caroline can twist her father around her little finger , " I said . Father Tucker 's eyes twinkled . " She 's irresistible , " he said . " She looks like a French doll . However , her brother Albert looks like a football player . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Philadelphia his grandfather  --  who , as you know , was a great oarsman  --  is already talking of making an oarsman of the boy and about the prizes he 'll win sculling on the Thames . " To prepare myself to call upon Prin  --  cess Grace of Monaco , I had first called upon Monsieur Delavenne , head of the Monegasque police . He is also the se  --  curity officer responsible for safeguarding the persons of the Monacan sovereign and his family . He is alert , blond and youthful . His headquarters is a building so attractive , so modern , so spotlessly clean and , at the same time , so comforta  --  ble that small misdemeanors are some  --  times committed by people who hope to spend a night in one of its cells and eat the excellent food the jail supplies . So attrac  --  tive is the board and lodging in the prin  --  cipality 's jail that anyone who gets a long sentence is sent to France to serve it . " Otherwise , " M. Delavenne told me , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was chiefly interested in discuss  --  ing the security procedures used to guard the Monegasque royal family . " With us security starts at home , " M. Delavenne said . " It begins with the sixty-five cora  --  binieri stationed at the palace . When any of the royal family leaves the palace a carcrbiniere notifies the office of the Mone  --  gasque Stirete Publique , which is another way of saying that l am notified . ft is then up to us to be on guard . If the princess goes to the beach or her hairdresser or to the Red Cross or to the hospital or shop  --  ping , we see to it that somebody is unob  --  trusively around in plain clothes as a pro  --  tective shield . " M. Delavenne added , " I have here a report from the plain-clothes man who accompanied the princess and her chil ? dren to the beach club yesterday for a swim . He was invisible  --  at least , he was supposed to be  --  but he saw and noted everyone who came near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess go out of an evening to a gala , we have agents who dress the way the rest of those present dress . If the other men wear dinner jack  --  ets , our agents wear them too . " M. Dela  --  venne confided in me , " One of the secrets of being unnoticed is for an agent to be polite . If he bothers no one , no one pays any attention to him . " If his royal charges go on a trip to Switzerland or France or some other country , M. Delavenne goes on ahead . If their trip , for example , is to be to Rome , he gets in touch with the Roman police and the Vatican police and works with them . he also works through the various offices of Interpol  --  an international po  --  lice force . M. Delavenne thought of something else . " The chauffeurs employed at the palace are carefully checked before they go on the payroll , and they are almost the equivalent of agents of the Siirete . One of our cardinal rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely , do n't take your eyes off him. ? He knocked on wood and said , " We 've had no incidents yet . " I had also chatted with the jolly , fresh-checked young Englishwoman who is em  --  ployed as nanny for the two Grimaldi children , Prince Albert and Princess Caroline . Her name is Maureen King , and she hails from Rugby , but she has been nicknamed " Killer " by Prince Rainier  --  because of the havoc she wreaks upon the food placed before her . Later on during a cocktail hour at the palace to which I was invited , I heard the prince say , " When the princess was in Lausanne , Switzerland , having her appendectomy , her private secretary and Killer King ran up a food bill bigger than the entire hos  --  pital bill . " The secretary protested that this was a wild exaggeration , but the prince was so amused at the notion that he refused to recant . Good humor bubbles up inside of Killer King inexhaustibly . " If she talks for twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spends nineteen of those minutes laughing for no reason other than the joy of living . Princess Caroline catches the infection from her and laughs all the time too . " Among other things I discovered was that four times as many tourists climb to the top of " The Rock " ? a high , rocky promontory upon which is the town of Monaco , the small nation 's capital  --  to look at the palace as enter the Monte Carlo Casino , About 250 people a day enter the casino . Almost 800 enter the Monacan Oceanographic Museum . Even more take a long look at the palace be  --  fore leaving the principality . I had been shown through the Monte Carlo Casino by an assistant manager . My principal memory of the place was a garland of plump , naked nymphs floating on one of its ceilings . Upon closer exam  --  ination it was apparent that each cush  --  iony dryad held a cigar in a soft rounded hand . It was explained to me that this was the artist 's way of telling onlookers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The assistant manager of the casino also told me , " You would have to break the whole casino now to do what used to be called ' breaking the bank at Monte Carlo . ' There is no longer a 50,000-franc limit as the maximum one table can lose , as there once was , and the practice of pulling a dark cloth , symbolizing mourn  --  ing , over a roulette wheel when the 50 , ? 000-franc limit on that wheel was reached , is gone . " In its day , that mourning dra  --  pery was an effective publicity gimmick invented by M. Camile Blanc , who was then director of the casino . His favorite joke was , " No matter whether it 's rouge or noir , Blanc always wins . " If f had been a loser under Blanc 's regime , his little joke would have left me very cold . I had also learned that the automobiles from the palace garage carry license plates on which the numbers end in " 77 . " An  --  other random item of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline sometimes watches the soccer games in the stadium far below , from the terrace of the palace gardens , calling out enthusiastically in // her small , piping treble , " Allen , Monaco ! " Additionally , 1 made a point of ques  --  tioning more than one female Mone  --  gasque citizen as to what kind of job Princess Grace was doing . 1 was told that before her arrival in Monaco , some of the local citizens had predicted that she would n't measure up to the responsibili  --  ties of official hostess in a place where protocol is important . There had been a feeling on the part of some Monegasque grandes domes that their prince might have done better to marry a girl sprung from European aristocracy rather than " a film queen , and an American one at that . " One of these Monegasque ladies told me , " Quite frankly , some of us here were waiting for her to stumble , but we have watched her like hawks , and she has not made a single false step . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dedicated one . " That word struck a gong in my mind . I had heard it before in Hollywood . People there had once told me , " Grace Kelly is dedicated to the idea of becoming a bet  --  ter actress . " It was plain that Grace Pa  --  tricia Kelly of Philadelphia , New York .1 and Beverly Hills has changed her dedica  --  tions . She is giving the same concentra  --  tion , care and thought to being president of the Monegasque Red Cross , to serving as the guiding spirit of the principality 's Girl Guides and to modernizing and re  --  building the Monacan hospital that she once gave to the art of acting . " Somehow Princess Grace is aware of all the minute pitfalls she could have fallen into , " one observer said to me . " She even seems aware of the tiny , invis  --  ible differences in the outlook of the vari  --  ous people she must deal with  --  and in the existence of personality clashes . She has managed to keep her outlook neu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes or rubbed anybody the wrong way . The majority of Monegasques are now delighted to have her presiding over the royal household . The prince 's face , which was at times bored and melancholy be  --  fore , is now radiant . " The wife of a prominent American ex  --  patriate in Monaco summed it up this way , " The princess has changed the prince 's purpose in life , and through him she is making her imprint upon Monaco . You ca n't look at the faces of the prince and princess today without realizing that they 're happy . You find yourself telling yourself , This one is going to last . Princess Grace 's poise and graciousness are ef  --  fortless . If I tried to be as poised and as gracious , I would fall apart and , I 'm afraid , act silly at the same time . I 've never seen the prince show a hint of jeal  --  ousy , although he must know very well that people want to see her as much as they want to sec him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . You can almost see his mind click off the thought , She 's mine , and I chose her . " An American businessman , retired and living in Monaco , contributed another nugget of information .
