In an age where computing machines sometimes seem in order to tote up basketball 's astronomical scores , California 's Coach Pete Newell , 44 , is a refreshing eccentric : he stresses defense . The Golden Bears , 1959 N.C.A.A. champions , often score fewer baskets in a night than some other teams rack up in a half . The trick of it is that their opponents score even fewer . In the Los Angeles Classic tournament over the holidays , they held West Virginia 's All-America Jerry West to one field goal as they won , 65 to 45 . The team 's top star is cloud-capped ( 6 ft. 10 in. , 210 Ibs . ) Darrall Imhoff , who averages only 11.8 points per game . Says Imhoff : " Sure , I like making buckets , but I really swell up when I block a shot . If you bat the ball down a guy 's throat on his favorite shot , he 's going to choke up a little . And he just might not try that shot again . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 games , suffered at the hands of Southern California ( 65-57 ) . But by a freak of scheduling , it had a chance to avenge the loss only two days later . In the second game , California scored only three more points than it had in the first game . But exhorted by Newell , its defense held the same Southern California team to 45 points , resulted in a 60-45 victory . <P> Hands Out . In practice , California 's Newell has each player shuffling along the floor with his knees flexed , one hand up , one hand down , for 20 minutes at a time . Says Newell : " The hand should be in the shooter 's face to disconcert him ; the other arm should be extended almost parallel to the floor to deflect passes . We condition arm muscles so that the arms can be held up over protracted lengths of time . In boxing , it is fatal to drop your hands ; the same is true in basketball . " Newell runs practice games at both fast and slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon , make the other team play the game we can play better than they can . We make them play at a speed they 're not used to . " <P> The Moppet . Newell arrived in the coaching profession in a roundabout fashion . Son of a Knights of Columbus official , he is the youngest of eight children ( " I was 13 before I knew that there was anything but a neck to a chicken " ) . When his family moved to Los Angeles from Vancouver , he was pushed into the movies by his mother , became a moppet movie star , acted with Theda Bara and Pauline White . Newell played in the silents for three years to the delight of neighborhood wise guys , recalls : " I probably had more fights than any other kid in my end of the city . " At Loyola University of Los Angeles , Newell was a three-letter man , after graduation spent an indifferent season as an outfielder in the Dodger farm system before turning to high school coaching . <P> After wartime service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Francisco basketball team . He led the Dons to a National Invitation Tournament championship in 1949 , quit in 1950 to go to Michigan State . In four years , Newell built the Spartans , long a door mat in Midwestern basketball , into a steady contender , was finally lured back to California in 1954.
