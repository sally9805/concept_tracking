A Story by JAMES THURBER The Danger in the House D R. MORTON PRELL and I are on the faculty of a Connecticut university , live not far apart in the college town , and see a great deal of each other . My name is George Merry , which has , in relation to ? this present report , a small and special significance , as we shall see . Morton teaches psychology and is older than I am in years , but often younger , it seems to me , in debate . The other night , in my library after dinner , we took up again what has become this winter 's postprandial discussion . Dr. Prell has said , testily , and , I think , unfairly , that I have given up discussion for oration . However that may be , our evening explorations of unconscious symbolism , both universal and unique , have not been , at least when I am allowed to talk , unrewarding . My own field is English literature , and Dr. Prell regards me as an amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a curious envy . The other night we began , over a second brandy , with my recital of a dream I had when I was six , in 1921 . Dr. Prell dismissed this memory as a piece of putative dialectical paramnesia , if I understood him correctly , and I 'm pretty sure I did n't . He frequently uses de ! - e.nsive obfuscation on me when 1 have himbacked into a polemical corner . Our wives were in the living-room , where , in my house or his , they sometimes seek to find the latent meaning of some of our behavior , such as his habit of lighting his spectacles instead of his cigar , and my occasional search for a belt or necktie which am either wearing at the time or holding in my hand . The ladies arc , to be candid about it , nonintellectuals given to distressing , and often headlong , oversimplifications . On the night of our most recent discussion , I told Dr. Prell a remarkable narrative dream of mine that had a truly 0 . Henryesque ending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a low , raftered ceiling . In it , besides myself , were two silent , motionless figures  --  a man in uniform whose right arm was missing , and a woman in a long white dress who held in her right hand something that glittered , an extraordinarily complicated piece of mechanism . At this point Dr. Prell interrupted by asking if the mechanism may not have been her hand instead of in it , after which he quoted front T. S. Eliot : When lovely woman stoops to folly and Paces about her room again , alone , She smoothes her hair with automatic hand , And puts a record on the gramophone . He wanted to know if any lovely woman had ever threatened to shoot me . My colleague is , alas , a Longfellow lover whose knowledge of modern poetry , outside of " The Waste Land , " is scanty at best . I ignored his irrelevant quotation and went on with my story . " I had a sense of great uneasiness in this dream , a feeling that there was a danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , you will say that the man , because of his uniform and missing right arm , represented some colleague of mine whom I fear and envy because he can do better work than I can with one arm tied behind him . " " Do n't tell me what 1 will say , " Dr. Prell said sharply . " Get on with it . " ' ' Suddenly the scene shifted , " I went on . " I was in a bedroom , apparently on the second floor of the house . Through the open door I could see two other doors across the hall . The man went into one of these rooms and I heard him lock and bolt his door . Then the woman went into the other room and I heard her lock and bolt her door . Oh , Prell , you 're about to light your spectacles again . Ynur cigar is in the ashtray . " " Thank you , " said Dr. Prell coldly , and he managed to put the spectacles and the cigar where they belonged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THE HOUSE relentlessly . " It came to me , then , that neither the man nor the woman could be the danger in the house , or they would not have locked and bolted themselves in their rooms . There must be , I realized , an unidentified menace . I decided to lock and bolt the door of my own room against this nameless threat , but , as you may have guessed , there was no lock , or key , or bolt . Furthermore . the door swung clear of the jamb by a good two inches . I looked about , a little wildly , and saw on a table what appeared to be the very mechanism the woman had held in her hand . I could not figure out all of its parts , but one of them was a blue pencil , a steely blue pencil , and another seemed to he a bottle-capper . " " The woman was , of course , a surrogate for your wife , or some other woman in a position of authority in your life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-founded suspicion that you drink too much , far too much , " Dr. Prell said . " On another table , " I went on coolly , " I saw a kit of tools , which I thought were carpenter 's tools . I picked up three of these , and discovered that what I held was a cold chisel , an acetylene torch , and a drill . In other words ? " " A set of burglar 's tools , " said Dr. Pre11 . I lit a cigarette and took a long inhale . " Precisely , " I said . " I then took off my shoes and started to walk softly toward the woman 's room , The sense of menace was gone . You see ? " " You were the danger in the house , " said Dr. Pre11 . " Were you going to kill this woman , or what ? " It was my wife 's voice , tinged with a familiar suspicion . " You have been eavesdropping , " I said . " So have I , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How did it come out ? " The ladies sat down on a davenport , each with a glass of brandy-and-Benedictine . " I woke up , " I said . " I always do in such a case . Even with tools , I can never get at the women in my dreams . " " Goes back to childish fumblings , juvenile A new collection of fames Thurber 's stories and sketches , " Credos and Curios , " to be published this fall , with an introduction by Helen Thurber , will include this piece  --  one of the last by the creator of " Walter Mitty " and " The Male Animal . " frustration , present insecurity , " said Dr. Prell , pedantically , as if I were a couch patient . " To be sure , it is not always easy to separate the urge to ravish from the wish to destroy . They are , in fact , often conjoined , as we all know . In this case , we have the chisel and the drill on the one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately overhasic , " he added , patronizingly . " I do n't think the woman was me , " Alice said . " I would n't bolt my door against you , darling , would I ? " " Some women bolt and run , others run and bolt , " I said , and Dr. Prell made a gesture of irritation , " Obfuscatory , " he murmured absently . I POURED myself some more brandy and said , " After you have gone , Alice will jump all over me for telling you about the woman in white , so I might as well explain another phenomenon of this particular dream . The lady had , then , two locks , one in the middle of her forehead and the other just above her heart . The first represented , of course , intellectual companionship , and the other a somewhat warmer consolation . I ? " " George invents things just to try to get me down , " Alice said . " He never has the key to anything , and we 're either locked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car started , or something . " " The key to a woman is not easy to find , " said Dr. Prell , a bit stuffily , I thought . He had walked , so to speak , right into a literary trap I had set for him . " Ali , what a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for certain keys in this our life , " I said . " All I get at breakfast nowadays is Meredith , " Alice said , with a small sigh . " Ail I actually wanted to do , " I said quickly , " was to tell the lady , ' Never shake thy gaudy locks at me . ' " None of them , I could tell from their blank expressions , got this rather neat paraphrase , and that annoyed me . " Speaking of dreams , " Harriet began , " the other night I called on the President of the United States at the White House , but it was n't Kennedy . It was an American Indian . His desk was piled high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " Elementary , " Dr. Prell began . " You see ? " " You are afraid the President has lost his sense of Know-how , " I put in . " My God , is he going to turn to Harriet for help ? " Dr. Prell exclaimed . " If so , we are even more lost than I had feared . " " I have n't remembered any dreams for years , " Alice said . " One of the last I remember was eight years ago , not long after Ave were married . " " Not the one about the blonde , " I protested . Alice gave a little shiver of disdain . " I can see her as plainly now as I did then , " she said . " A horrible woman . You , " she said to me , " were wearing a mask , and I do n't blame you , for nobody would want to be recognized with such a frump . " She turned to Dr. Prell . " It was in the lobby of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in a chair when the two of them came in and got on the elevator . My charming husband glanced at his wristwatch and said to me , ' We wo n't be a minute . ' Then the elevator door closed and up they went . " " Alice has reproached me for eight years because of that incident , " I said . " I have never worn a wristwatch , and I do n't prefer blondes . " " After all , Alice , the dream was yours , " Dr. Prell said . " It is true , of course , that the unconscious mind is extraordinarily perceptive , even intuitive , but it does make mistakes . It can be unfair as a result of jealousy , or some other common female frailty . " " I think she wanted to unmask my ideology at the time , " I said . " I would n't tell her how I was going to vote that year . " " You ca n't get out of it that easily , " my wife said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion was an etcher and wanted to show me her etchings , " I said , a little too casually . " They were the usual run-of-the-mill stuff , a few flowers , as I recall it , red roses and the like , and one or two rather bad jobs she had done on the ch  --  teaux of the Loire . " " I do n't believe a word of it , " Alice said . She had , I could tell , been drinking more brandyand-Benedictine than was good for me . I thought we should all have highballs now , instead of more brandy , and I set about making them . " In the early 1950s , before McCarthage delenda was , I had some terrible nightmares , " I said . " In them the menace in Washington and the menace in the home were all mixed up . Alice was always giving parties in my dreams , and I was always showing up with six , or sex , blondes , who were pure , or impure , creations of her suspicious mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always such characters on hand as Benedict Arnold , Major Andre , Aaron Burr , and Simon Girty . She did n't know it , and I hale never told her before , but the caterer 's men were all government agents . " I passed the highballs around . " Alice has a dossier in my dreams as long as your arm , " I said . " I would n't ask anybody to a party of mine named Simon Girty because I 've never heard of anybody named Simon Girty , " Alice said . " He 's just making this all up . He 's trying to make me forget about that awful woman at the elevator . " She turned to Harriet . " You never saw such a getup in your whole life , " she said . " Everything was hiked up in front and pulled down behind . " " We had been wrassling in the taxi , not to put too fine a point on it , " I con fessed . D R. PRELL had fairly gulped ins drink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " he said , " there has been a certain woman who recurs in my dreams . For reasons I shall not bother to detail , I had figured her as a surrogate for Harriet . Then one night , Harriet walked in on us . " " Caught you cold , eh ? " I asked . " I do n't like evenings like this , " Harriet said . " Who was she , if she was n't me ? " " You do n't have to answer that question , " I said hastily . " Shall I put the ' Sweetheart of Sigma Chi ' on the victrola ? If the moonlight beams on the girl of your dreams , perhaps we can all figure out who she is . " " She was chewing gum , " Alice said suddenly , and we all looked at her . " The blonde at the elevator , " I explained . " Juicy Fruit , " Alice added , and held out her empty glass . " He probably still sees her . " " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws at me in her dreams , I would become a monk , " I said with some finality . " When did you first begin seeing that woman that you say you thought was me ? " Harriet asked her husband . Dr. Prell tried to look owlish , but did n't quite bring it off . Comedy is scarcely his field , " After all , I have been behaving properly in Alice 's dreams for eight years now Have n't I ? " I demanded . " Only because I ca n't remember my dreams , that 's why , " Alice said . " What does a long white dress mean in a dream , Morton ? " " Virginity , " said Dr. Prell . " Virginity , my foot , " said Alice . " 1 think she was a female obstetrician . Disbarred , " she added . " Then what do you make of the acetylene torch ? " Dr. Prell asked her . " Fundamental , " I said before she could answer . " Tigress , tigress burning bright in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand him when he gets cute , " Alice said , putting me in the third person , always a sign of chill and trouble . " I do n't know why the 46 THE DANGER IN THE HOUSE hell he does n't teach palmistry . At night , maybe , on the third floor of an old school building somewhere . " " Without a fire escape ? " I demanded . " I could n't care less whether it has or has n't , " she said , and I made a round of drinks that none of us needed . " Men are always making things harder than they really arc , " Alice said . " They explain dreams exactly the same way they explain where they have n't been when any woman knows they have . You ca n't tell me that blonde hussy had anything whatever to do with infancy exhibitions . Any woman would know , any wife , that it could mainly be what is in George 's mind when he 's grown up . " " Now we go into clairvoyance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I exchanged knowing glances . " What did you do with this woman that you always say you thought was me ? " Harriet demanded . " What did you do with Big Chief How How ? " Dr. Prell demanded in his turn , his voice pitched a little high . " I hate obscuringism , " Alice said , obscurely . " I know what you mean , " said Harriet , who did n't . " Dreams , " said Dr. Prelt , standing up , " should not be made the subject of too much levity . Come , Harriet , we must be going . " " Sit clown a minute . " I said . " It is n't late , and I want to tell you something I just remembered about one of those subversive parties Alice was always giving in my dreams . " " You did n't just remember it , " Alice said . " You just made it up . " " In one of these party dreams  --  it was a party on our lawn  --  I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Booth , " I said , " hut I knew I had to get away , so that I could hide certain books here in this library . " Morton Prell perked up . " Interesting , " he said . " What books ? " " Wait till 1 tell you , " I said , " When I got in here , Long John Silver was standing right over there , holding a copy of ' Traitor Island . ' " " Long John Silver is always in his nightmares , " Alice put in , " because he read about him when he was eight years old . " " Very interesting , " said Dr. Prell . " Silver 's crutch is , of course , a symbol of your need for help . " " Nonsense , " I said . " It is a symbol of kis need for help . " " Quibble quabble , " said Harriet . " If some-thing is n't hard , men will make it hard . Everything dual is always oneness in idioms , " she added fuzzily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keen ear , and she has a light hand with a cake and a nose fur news . " " That would have to be a nostril for news , " her husband said . " 1 took the book away from Silver , " I said , returning to my story , " and hid it behind a stack of others . Then I noticed , to my horror , that the titles of a lot of other familiar books had changed . I saw ' Un-American Tragedy ' by Dreiser , ' Alias in Wonderland , ' and ' Look Homeward , Agent , ' for instance . " " He 's worked on that one for days . I can tell , " Alice said . " It does seem contrived , " said Dr. Prell , " but the unconscious mind is most inventive , most inventive . " " I want to get back to my library dream , " I cut in impatiently . " I heard the caterer 's men COMing , and I hastily hid a book with the title ' Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the books beginning with L and stuck it under another letter . You can guess what one , ca n't you , Morton ? " I asked . " Oh ? " said Morton . " Not at all , " I said . " Lincoln , as we know , became , in our age of political suspicion , unfairly associated with subversive organizations . As the caterer 's men came into the library , I whispered to Silver , ' Now he belongs to the H 's . ' " " Remarkable , " said Dr. Prell . He stood up again and said , " Now we must go , Harriet . " " Not until I explain to you illiterates why Long John Silver gets into my nightmare , " 1 said . " His deadliest enemy in ' Treasure Island ' happens to be a man named George Merry . Near the end of the book Silver shoots George Merry and kills him . That scared me when I was eight years old and it still scares me , apparently . " " Unfamiliarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prell said stiffly as he reached the door . A FTER we had said goodnight , Alice fled upstairs without a word . I went back to the library and finished my drink slowly . Then I went up and tried the door of Alice 's bedroom . It was neither locked nor bolted . " You are the danger in the house , " I told her . " I just wanted to explain the long white dress . You always wear a long white nightgown . In short , white is the color of my true love 's dress . " " Shut up , " she said . When Alice says shut up at that hour of the night , she means it . I shut up . Harper 's Magazine , September 1962
