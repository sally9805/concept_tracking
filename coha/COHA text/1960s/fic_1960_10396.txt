he finished reading this description , the image which passed in strong light through Matthew 's mind was not that of the sunny , dustsweptpost , but that of Laura . " How will you like it , my darling ? " he wondered , looking out through the rear opening of the canvas over him . His belly went hollow at the thought of so much reinforcement  --  the unpromising aspect of Fort Delivery  --  for the masterly campaign of Mrs. Greenleaf . And then he felt his face turn hot , and his mind , too , as he said in his thought , " They wo n't stop us . She will come because I will be there . " He felt beloved , and therefore strong , and thus equal to creating anywhere in any condition the life Laura would ask of him . A week after Matthew 's arrival at Fort Delivery the wagon was to leave with mail for the railroad . He sent with it a letter to Laura , enclosing the official description of the post which he had copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including these : The officer who wrote the report on this place was accurate and thorough , but seeing it makes a difference . It is the difference between a map and the country it depicts . Things standing up on the ground and throwing shadows are different from flat outlines . But the physical aspect of things is fairly well caught , and you can trust his words . The human aspects are another matter , for of course these change , and he did n't set out to describe them anyway . I do n't know if I can . Anyway , I was received by the acting commanding officer , First Lieutenant Theodore Mainwaring . He has been in command for months , expecting the new C.O. , a Major Prescott , every week . Evidently orders have been mixed up . It is a pity , for the quality of command at present leaves much to be desired . The state of the garrison is deplorable  --  lazy , insolent , complaining , and generally below par in health . In a place like this , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be expended to render life worthwhileand rewarding . Mainwaring showed me around the day after I arrived  --  we got in after dark  --  and at every example of bad discipline and poor order he was too eager to explain and apologize before I had made any remarks at all . He looks at me out of the corner of his eye to see what I think . Well , I am the lowest rankingp101officer here , and my thinking remains private . But if the new C.O. do n't come along soon , we must have trouble of some sort or another . When matters decline , if they are not reversed , a crisis must come . Mainwaring is personally agreeable enough , and so is his wife , whom he calls Kitty . He is a big , rather soft , loose-skinned fellow , eight or ten years my senior ( class of ' 70 ) . Nice-looking and always grinning . You ca n't help liking him when he puts himself out for you . She is small , thin , pretty with pale eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . Very social . Loves to entertain , and gasps over the idea of entertaining here . She calls it Fort Deliver-Me . ' Is madly in love with Teddy , as she calls him , and when she says anything to anybody else , she keeps watching him as if it is meant for him . They have no children , but keep a big greyhound , named Garibaldi , a fine animal whom she adores . She is kind and helpful , and swears she will make my quarters attractive , though I 'd be glad to fix them up myself . I 'll describe them below . The other officer here is the surgeon , Captain Gray , and his wife . They live in quarters #2 . ( The Mainwarings of course occupy #1 , the commanding officer 's quarters . ) The Grays are elderly , very nice , both English-born , and keep rather to themselves , though of course in so small a place , we all see each other constantly . He has said to me that as soon as he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to have a talk with me . I shall welcome this , though it may create certain difficulties , for already I feel that I am caught between two conditions . One , my proper loyalty and demeanor as a subordinate , and two , my professional conscience as an officer who must refuse to let near-disgraceful conditions continue to exist , if they can be improved . For now , I 'll content myself with remarking that the men simply have not got enough to do , and are deteriorating of it . Not enough to do , and this in a place where the most active reconnaissance and patrol action should be maintained at all times ! Well , do n't get me started . My quarters are at the end of the line . They offered me #3 , also vacant at my arrival , but I decided to move now into #4 , as I would only have to shift from 3 to 4 when the new C.O. does arrive . Adobe , flat roof , thick walls , one room , but with a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I am still cleaning it out , and having some men paint the walls inside with whitewash , and put glass in the rear window , and fix the front door so it 'll actually shut and stay shut . We are sprinkling down the earth floor every day and tamping it to harden it , so the dust wo n't continually blow up off it . I have an iron cot from the company barracks , and a table , and a canvas chair , and an oil lamp , and a mirror , and a basin , and a locker , andp102my own few things I brought along , dearest and best of which is the little French enamel box you gave me with you-know-what inside . I hold it in my hand when I am sitting and thinking , and when I go to sleep at night . At night when the moon comes in the brilliance is unbelievable , it makes a shining white page on my floor . I look at it and think that the same light shines upon where you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this too ? My room : all I can think of is what it will be like after you come here to do the right things to it . It really can be made very nice . Mrs. Mainwaring says she is going to make me some curtains , but I do n't want them , and do n't know how to tell her so . I will think of a way . One thing may help the general situation . Now that I am here , Mainwaring says he may devote all his time to the office , and make me troop commander . I 'd have much to do . I would start with the horses , who have a generally neglected and dejected air about them . Meanwhile , I 'd come to know the men , and they me . I expect the horses will like me better . You will worry until I tell you how I take my meals . The Grays and the Mainwarings both invited me to share theirs , and so I do , by turns , and will make up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . It is kind of them . They are all most kind , and seem glad to see me ; but this is only because I am an event , as a newcomer in so remote and outlandish a spot . He closed with endearments which gave him deep happiness which lasted , after a spell of hot , quick sadness which did not . Matthew amused himself by thinking that Captain A. Cedric Gray , Surgeon , U.S. Army , seemed to carry his character around with him as an exhibit of which he was indignantly jealous and proud . It would have astonished Captain Gray to hear of this impression . He was entirely unself-conscious . If he impressed Matthew , and other Americans in this way , it was because he was in their eyes so different from themselves . The difference which to him was native and unremarkablelay in the fact that he was an Englishman by birth and tradition , though since his nineteenth year he had lived in the United States and considered himself as good an American as the next man.  |p103But  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisply logical to an unusual degree , and his outspokenness was sometimes unflattering , which often disconcerted the libertarians among whom he had come to live . He was of medium stature , his hair was grizzled and short , his mustache and beard were trimmed close , and his light-blue eyes under a habitual scowl held a challengingvitality of gaze . If he seemed generally critical in his views , this did not mean that he liked nothing . In fact , he so much wanted the best in life for creatures who worked to deserve it , or who could not help themselves , like children and common soldiers and domestic animals , that anything short of it made him cross on their behalf . One evening after supper , which they had shared with Matthew , the Grays asked him to linger for a special treat  --  a sip of Scotch liqueur . They were comfortable in the sitting room , where over the ragged easy chairs Mrs. Gray had thrown large paisley shawls . By lamplight , which drew moths in the hot evening , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  those things which were nearest , and those farthest away . " I expect you know what you think , by now , " said the surgeon to Matthew , " about all this . " He gestured to indicate the whole fort . " I do , sir . If I may speak unofficially , I do n't think we can wait much longer for the new commanding officer to clean things up . " " Nor do I. But short of insubordination , what could be done ? " " I do n't know , sir . " " Oddly enough , I was a line officer in the war , and I commanded a battalion in action . I could manage here well enough . But my orders do n't authorize me to take command here . " " You were a battalion commander ? " Mrs. Gray smiled at the diversity of her remarkable husband . " He is a patchwork quilt , " she said . " You never saw so many shapes and colors . All of them bonny . " " Aggh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look out . She 's turning over in her mind a long story . " " It is natural , " she replied , " so far away , in a place as strange as this , to think back to other days and places .  --  Let me show you , " she said , putting aside her sewing basket . She went to a cabinet and brought out a portfolio and opened it , showing Matthew a thick sheaf of water-color drawings  --  landscapes , soldiers in groups , formal rows of brick houses in a city street , aspects of ships.  | " He did them , " she added . " Everywhere he goes , he makes a record of what he sees . Everywhere but here . " " I 've had no time , " said the doctor . " I have time for everything , and so I do nothing . It takes a busy man to do anything extra , like drawing . " " They are very pleasing pictures , " said Matthew , who had never looked at pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now interested him more as expressions of Doctor Gray 's personality than as works of art . " I would like to look at them more carefully sometime . " " You shall . " The portfolio was put away . They all knew he would never see them again . " Sir , " said Matthew , " Mr. Mainwaring said he might give me command of the troop . Has he said anything to you about it ? " " No . But I wish he would . I can see that even with all your inexperience you would do better than he . " Mrs. Gray made an inward sigh at this frankness . " Well , Maud , I mean it , and so shall say it . " Matthew felt obliged not to pursue the matter since it contained the materials of shock . He said respectfully and with interest , " Doctor , are you English ? " " I was . I was born near Lechlade , Gloucestershire , where my father was estate manager for the Earl of Faringdon . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country of his birth . " First in life I knew deep forest and water meadow . Through them ran a little stream where I played . When I heard that it became the Thames , that ran to the sea , I was taken by the news . It was not unusual for a boy of my time and station to think of the sea as a career . And so did I. When I was twelve , my father turned me over to a shipmaster he knew . I was articled as a cabin boy . " " Cedric , " said his wife , " Mr. Hazard does n't want to hear all this . " " Do n't you ? " asked the doctor flatly of Matthew . " I do , of course I do , " said Matthew , leaning forward with his hands clasped between his knees . " There , " said the doctor to his wife . " I shall proceed , for it is my experience that in out-of-the-way places it is our past lives by which we make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove me down to Folkestone through Fairford and Winchester in a two-wheeled cart and said good-by to me with the fiercest lookp105I had ever seen on his face . I know now that his loving ferocity was an attempt to make his lad a man right there and then . " " To a surprising degree , " said Mrs. Gray , " it worked . " " I had a handful of sovereigns tied in a handkerchief which Lord Faringdon had given me . Two years later on my first return home I still had them . " " He kept them , actually , " said Mrs. Gray , " until he arrived in New York in 1844 on a sailing packet . " " That is so . There I stepped ashore , changed my money , and remained to become an American . " " He used to say he came ashore once too often . " His time aboard ship in all those years had been given to his duties and to reading . He loved best of all to read medical books , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency among crew or passengers . On later voyages in greater ships he made friends with the surgeon if there was one aboard ; and he knew he wanted to become a doctor in his turn . For his first year in America he worked in the New York office of an importing house . He saved much of his wages , and when he could , he went to Philadelphia to begin his training for medicine . Here too he had a job , but his energy seemed boundless . His sense of responsibility , acquired at sea , and his own lively intelligence assured him of steady employment . Between his job and his studies he worked fourteen hours a day and prospered on it . He even found time to haunt the libraries and museums of Philadelphia . He particularly enjoyed the Peale Museum with its combination of exhibits in natural history and the fine arts . He became an amateur of drawing , and formed the habit of a lifetime in making sketches . In 1849 , when he was twenty-four years old , he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to marry . The girls he knew in America were all very well , but he wanted a wife who would know him not only as he was , but as a child of his old country . After a few days spent at home in permitting his parents , and old Lord Faringdon , to be proud of him in their uncommunicativefashion , he borrowed the two-wheeled cart and rode over to Cirencester for divine services in the ancient church there . The curate , an elderly man long since resigned to the remarkable persistenceof life in his vicar , had a daughter eighteen years old.  | " Her name was Maud Cantwell . I met her in the churchyard after vespers . " " He blustered a bit , " she said . It pleased Cedric Gray that even his most blustery opinions seemed acceptable to her , as they had not seemed to be to girls in Philadelphia , who were inclined to wrangle with him in a maidenly way . " I took his manner for granted , " said Maud Gray . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but saying  --  what is right and what ought to be done , and done promptly , whether at home or anywhere else in the world . " He asked her after several visits to her in Cirencester whether she might ever think of living in America . " Do you remember what you answered ? " he asked . " I do . I thought it over , and then I said that it would not matter where I lived , if my place in life should take me away from home , for I had faith in God , and I believed people everywhere tried to do the best they could , and I thought I could do my share of duty in America as anywhere else . " Would she consider becoming the wife of a man of medicine , which might at first be a difficult life ? She considered the healing art to be a noble vocation , and would be honored to assist it in any way in her small power , if she should be called upon to do so . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him when he received his degree , which would take three more years . She believed that she would be able to give him her answer if they would write to one another in the interim and know one another through a frank exchange of their inmost thoughts and hopes . It was such a reply as must have been approved by the Queen in her exemplary family life . The curate approved the tentative engagement , and Cedric Gray returned to Philadelphia considering himself as good as married . " In 1852 , " he said , " she came alone by sailing packet to Boston . " He looked proudly at her now as he had then . " It took courage to cross the Atlantic alone in those ships . I had offered to go home to fetch her , but she told me that the expense was considerable , and we would need all our resources to weather the first years of marriage and the uncertainties of a new medical practice . " He looked at her again and said as if admonishing history itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world who knows how to be a darling withoutsacrificing everyone else to the idea . " They were married in Boston 's Trinity Church , with witnesses provided by the rector . " I did love Boston , " she said . They expected to spend a week there . Through their new friend at Trinity Church they met a few people , and finally an old surgeon who might do with a young assistant . After various restrained interviews by the old doctor , Doctor Gray found himself as the assistant in a flourishing practice . Boston did not take eagerly to strangers , but Doctor Gray had the advantage of impeccable local sponsorship , and if a man must be a stranger in Boston , the best kind for him to be was an Englishman , and one so grainy in temperament and clear of mind as Doctor Gray . " We were happy there , " murmured Mrs. Gray . In Boston were born their two children , a boy and a girl . There Doctor Gray found enough ferment of opinion and individuality in conversation to interest him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure contrasts in atmosphere too sharply different from life in England  --  such contrasts as she might have encounteredfarther west . Boston was the real center of the American conscience , and admitted it , especially in respect to the issue of slavery . Abolitionist sentiment , debate and action were constant and lively in Boston during the ' 50 's , and Doctor Gray strongly expressed his views against slavery and any individual or institution which condonedit for any reason whatever . When the War came in 1861 , he arranged for his practice to be divided between several other doctors in Boston , and offered himself to the first volunteer mustering of Lincoln 's army as a medical officer . He was accepted immediately . Maud Gray and the children remained in Boston throughout the War . Doctor Gray passed much of his time in war in a state of controlledrage . In the first place , it seemed to him abominable that the matter of slavery had to be fought over ; any civilized man must admit offhand that slavery should be abolished by law and the law never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took too long to be decided . He resented every casualty which the War , and the philosophicaland economic argument of its occasion , continued to cost month by month through the years . In the third place , he was nearlyp108consumed by the anger which rose up in him at the incompetence of so much of the War 's administration on both sides . In his third year as a front-line surgeon he was attached to a unit commanded by an elderly major who , with every advantage on his side , yet withdrew his battalion in the face of far weaker but more gallant enemy forces . " Stupendous imbecility ! " roared Doctor Gray , and though he obeyed orders to retreat , he made his opinion plain far and wide . Word of the action came to the ears of the general officer commandingin the vicinity . An investigation was ordered , and Doctor Gray volunteered to testify . The general himself presided , and heard Doctor Gray denounce the miserable old major in terms of " **25;2042;TOOLONG , " " cowardly disregard for the mission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would you have done under the circumstances , doctor ? " asked the general . " I would have pulled out the center and sent it around the left flank , and closed the front-line gap by extension  --  " and proceeded with a fully developed plan of aggressive action which revealed , if he did say so , a full grasp of tactical and strategic principles . When he was done he was ordered to report in private to the general , who offered him a command as a line officer . " If good surgeons are desperately needed , doctor , " said the general , " good commanders are even more in short supply . " " I told him , " said Doctor Gray , " that I could not abandon my medical duty on the grounds that casualties would continue to mount up , needing my help . " The general disposed of this by saying , " Is it not better to prevent than cure ? " Doctor Gray reddened and agreed . " Done ! " said the general  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take command of his old battalion with the temporary rank of major . So , having thought like a soldier , Major Gray became one , and finished the War in the line . " So far as we knew , " said Mrs. Gray to Matthew , " he was the only medical officer in the Civil War who also achieved the status of line officer . " The four years of the War were the greatest experience of Major Gray 's life.  |p109When  the War ended he returned to Boston , intending to pick up again the threads and patterns of his civilian life . The attempt was a failure . He loved the Army too well to forget it . Maud Gray had no separate opinion of what the family should do . When he said to her that he would above all else like to be back in uniform as an army surgeon  --  for he still loved his medical work  --  she saw that he could have the substance of both his worlds if he returned to the Army . She encouraged him to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular commission in the medical corps . He arrived there just in time to see General Quait , who was preparing to leave for the Dakotas and the Sioux campaign . General Quait wrote a strong recommendation for him . Six months later Cedric Gray was again an officer , though with reduced rank . Gathering up his family he left Boston forever . His first station in his restored militarystatus was with Quait in Dakota . Among the things he loved about the United States was the extraordinaryvariety of experience which lay open to the men of his time and place there . He did not feel unique in his history  --  almost everyone he knew on the frontier had a remarkable diversity in his background . If he had stayed in England he might never in his life have moved beyond London  --  perhaps Cheltenham and even Cirencester might have been his farthest horizon . His portfolios of sketches were a record of the changes , and contrasts , and degrees of learning which his hardy life brought to him , to which he was equal in his energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her feelings , was equal to them too . Coming to the Indian West where hitherto their values had little relevance , they , and others like them , gave with their being the civilization which had made them . They saw their children grow with satisfaction . Their son entered Harvard College . Their daughter married early , into the Army . CaptainGray and his wife proceeded on orders to Fort Delivery in 188  --  , unencumbered by anything , veterans of every possible discomfort in other army posts , and indifferent , he brusquely , she calmly , to whatever inconvenience and danger might await them . " We have not , I suppose , " said Mrs. Gray , " actually seen worse , but after years in the Army , it is all a same of a sameness . " They had made Matthew an occupant of their memories , and though there were many deep privacies which he could not know , and though the Grays themselves could not say forth all that theyp110were and meant to each other , the three of them in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other . Mrs. Gray was still small and delicate in appearance . Her hair was white . Her cheeks showed their fresh English color . She still spoke slowly and softly , but now in her years firmly . Her voice was appealing . There were marks of life in her face , and at moments she looked tired and drained , but then if she smiled , she seemed to lose years . Her husband loved to look at her . To him she was the most beautiful creature in the world . He sometimes wondered how she had endured all the storms that had come her way for living with him . Upon marrying she had resolved that her husband must always be right , in whatever situation . He did not realize , as they matured together , how often he decided what was right on the basis of what she would think . If he had his power , she had hers . " Are you familiar , Mr. Hazard , with all our regulations ? " asked the doctor in a brisk change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'd only urge you to know best those dealing with safety . " " Oh : yes : those . " " Most important  --  never to go off post alone unless under orders . The women , of course , never , never without armed escort and then only for necessary travel in large parties . " " Yes , sir . " " All seems quiet . You would never believe such rules advisable . But then most of all is the time to be true to them . " " Yes , sir . " " The men get impatient . Who can blame them ? They like to try their superiors . They like to risk a dare . Boys . Watching you with their tongues sticking out of the corners of their mouths , to see how far they can  --  " He shrugged and laughed . " They 're not a bad lot , unless you think all humankind a bad lot , which I do not , being made , like the rest , of bone , gristle , fatty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the breath of God in all of it . If you know where you are , and who you are , you 'll do , even here . " He paused , looked down , and then again straight at Matthew . " That 's the difficulty with Mr. Mainwaring . He may know where he is , but he does n't know who he is . " " Cedric . " " Aagggh . I 've done it again . "  |p111Matthew  stood up and said good evening . " We 've been glad to have you . Some day you must get back at us by telling all about yourself . " " You had something to tell , sir . I have nothing . Yet . " When he was gone , Doctor Gray turned to his wife and said , " I love him for that yet , ' do n't you ? " A few days later Matthew , on returning from the stables where he and Joe Dummy worked some young horses , found Mrs. Mainwaring in his quarters hanging new calico curtains at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed . " Oh ! " she cried , blushing wildly pink , which made her blue eyes darker and her curly hair , moist with exertion , even more in disarray , " I meant to be finished and gone before you returned ! " His thoughts darkened . He did not want any woman but Laura to touch into his manner of living . He put his wide-brimmed hat and his sweated gloves on the packing-box table and lifted his hands to help her down from the stool on which she stood . " But I am not finished ! " she said . " I will finish it . Thank you . " " Oh . I have intruded . I have made you cross . But I was only trying to  --  " " No , no , Mrs. Mainwaring , thank you , it is ever so kind . They 're very pretty curtains . They will keep me much cooler in here . But you must n't go to any more trouble . " He took her hand and steadied her to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , again , once again , a gesture she had made to reach someone had somehow gone wrong ; why , she could not say . How different it was to have been . ... Busy work in secret , to surprise a nice , handsome young stranger who would add so much to the limited interest of life at the post ; careful watching to see when he would be out so the surprise could be installed and ready for his return ; his return , his delight , his instant visit to thank her , to admire her handicraft , to be touched by her ardent kindness , to realize what a splendid wife she made to a post commander ; his admiration for her husband coming alight as ap112natural consequence of what he owed her for her generosity ; a wonderfulnew friendship , and  --  and  --  other details of imagined pleasure . But what was the fact ?  --  only a glum , dark young man , hot from work , and disarranged to find an unexpected female in his Spartan quarters , doing something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh why ? She could not see that having inventeda little drama which was to be played out according to her will only , for her gratification alone , it might not necessarily be gratifyingto anyone else , and so must fail her rapturous fancy . She felt a chill of pride come over her . She lifted what of herself would lift  --  eyebrows , cheeks , shoulders , manner , and said , in her style of commanding officer 's wife , " So hope you will be more comfortable , Mr. Hazard . Do come to see us when you can .  --  Thank you  --  " the door . Holding a gather of her long skirts , she stepped her way in the sandy glare rapidly to her house at the head of the north line , a little distance away . Matthew watched after her , shaking his head at his clumsiness , and feeling her unspoken unhappiness , and taking blame  --  too much blame  --  for it upon himself . That evening , when supper tasks were done , and the swift dark had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so could Matthew in his room , the ebb and flow of discord in Quarters 1 . Matthew did not know that he was the occasion for it . All that reached him was the alternation of stridencies with deeper-voiced grumbles . The two voices rose and fell , telling vaguely of misery and unpleasantness , want and denial . Matthew groaned at the vulgarity of it , and covered his ear with a pillow ; but the night was not yet cool enough to permit that soft weight , and he uncovered , thinking crossly that when he should marry people would see what marriage could be like . " I would not have told you , would I ? " asked Kitty Mainwaring in the darkness of the bedroom where she lay with her husband , and whose open windows carried the tone if not the words of their continuingquarrel down the north line , " would I ?  --  if there had been anything to conceal ? Would I be that much of a fool ? " " I do n't like your bringing up that possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then why do you heave and growl so , just because I made him a set of cheap little calico curtains from leftover material ?

If you were anything of a commanding officer , you would n't even have to think about how to be one , much less use your wife to keep you full of  --  " She desisted on a quick intake of breath . She had not meant to say this . She had even refused to think of the subject . She had no desire to kill anything in her husband 's poor pride . Further , to scorn him as an officer was to throw away something of her own worth as his wife . She felt in the dark how she had wounded him . She bit her lips . Her heart surged toward him . He was so defenseless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . No man was perfect . Her heart felt a little stab of humility and pleasure : he had even been jealous because she made curtains for the handsome and lofty young lieutenant who had arrived at the fort . Poor Teddy , she said to herself , and , having hurt him as only she could hurt him , she was now faintly swollen with loving and protective feelings for him . " Teddy , darling . . . " she whispered . He refused to reply . Lying in the darkness , large , soft and mortally young in his vulnerable heart , he let tears of sorrow for his lot gather and sting along the edges of his eyelids . She was right . Her grasp of the truth was always horribly right . But why did she have to beat him with it ? Other women became , or behaved like , what a man wanted them to be . Why not Kitty ? But he knew why . It was because he could not make her conform to his will . How often he had vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show them , the others , the Grays , the soldiers , the War Department : show who was master around here , and who , however it might look for the moment , really had the long-term answer for  --  for everything . The abiding concern of the Mainwarings was what others thought of them , and in every degree of dissembled anxiety , they searched for the reflections of themselves in their associates and superiors in the Army , who might have dismissed them as snobs except for the fact that they were both more or less miserable much of the time , making each other so , and even extending to others around them their bridling uneasiness ; and for the further fact that with all their weakness and vanity , they possessed appealing traits which made claims upon friendship . It was these traits which had drawn them to one another in their younger days , when what later came to seem like trying characteristicsp114then seemed in the health and freshness of youth to be droll little vagaries which could be laughed or kissed away . Kitty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , and determined to establish out of unpromising beginnings her own excellence . As a woman , years later , she bore the watered-down and matured reflections of those qualities , and now they seemed like anxiety , envy , willfulness and doubt . Ted as a youth had been easygoing , cheerful , clumsy as a puppy and as playful ; and as a man in middle life , he had become the victim of those traits until he seemed lazy , overeager to please , soft and troubled by the mystery of his failure to " go farther . " What had happened to them ? Teddy Mainwaring met Kitty Dodge in New York during a weekendin 1869 . She was a working girl with whom he had an encounter one winter evening on a Fifth Avenue horsecar . The step at the rear of the car was icy . She slipped and fell in mounting it . He was waiting to enter the car behind her . He helped her up . She clung to him , shaken , and thanked him , and then bridling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car under her own power . By the light of the oil lamp in the front of the cabin he watched her find a seat . She wore a little green velvet cap shaped like a canister . A voluminous cloak of black broadcloth trimmed with bars of green velvet swept from her shoulders down over the wide spread of her hoops . It was tied beneath her pointed little chin with a large bow of ribbed black silk . Ted Mainwaring had to smile because it made her look like a kitten . He was pleased with himself for noticing this , for he knew that ordinarily his imagination was not active . On the bench where she sat there was room for him beside her , and he took it . She stared straight ahead to discourage familiarities from a West Point cadet in uniform , for she knew " all about " those young men of the Academy . But he would talk to her , he was merry and at ease , and she lost her suspicion of him . She permitted him to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken by her small mishap , but he could not tell whether this was or was not a true statement . She lived with her widowed mother whom she supported by work as a sempstress in a downtown dress factory . Her specialty was " finishing . " What was this ? he asked  | " Oh , sewing braid , and cord , and bugles , galloons and fancy buttons , on the frocks which the other girls put together . " The work was hard and ill-paid , and she hated it , but what could she do ? She was clever with her fingers and it was all she could find . " After Papa died , and Mama was so ill , and we realized we were so poor , somebody had to do something , and I was that somebody , and so . . . " she spread her hands in comic gallantry which touched him , as it was meant to do . Many of the other girls in the shop  --  she delicately made plain  --  were of a type no lady could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentlewoman in unlucky circumstances . Her eyes blazed with determination to free herself of that life somehow , but the terms were going to be her own , and proper , and " nice . " Ted asked if he could call again at her lodging house in West Twenty-third Street , and she replied that she would be pleased to have him meet her mother , who was a semi-invalid . It was not entirelya romantic opening , but it sufficed . He saw her whenever he could come to New York . He became her habit , and she his desire . He achieved it one night in his boardinghouse a few blocks from hers . The extent of her joy frightened him , but not so greatly as that of the horror which came in a storm afterward . Her self-hatred was surpassed only by her hatred of him ; and the only way he could restore calm and perceive any future at all was to promise that they would be married . Immediately upon being graduated with his class , he found himself a married man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bride . He was a kind young man , mild in all his humors , and Kitty won dominion over him by her high-keyed prettiness and vivacity . If she fell into low spirits fairly regularly , he knew what lay at the root of these , and he would hold her little sharp chin in his big thumb and fingers , and shake it playfully , and tell her she was not to go on all her life brooding about that mistake of theirs in the boardinghouse before they were married . What was done was done , and they were man and wife , and what difference did it make ? But she knew  --  oh , she knew , and even if nobody else knew , that was enough : and sometimes she thought people looked at her as if they knew , too . He would say , in various ways , " You know something ? I 'm not sorry it happened . I 'm glad . How do you like that ? "  | " Teddy ! " " Yes , because you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't taken advantage of you "  --  this was her officially established version of the episode  --  " and then where would I be ? " She loved him for this . If he ambled through life in a loose , houndlikeway , gentle and undemonstrative , taking things as they came , she was alive with inner pulsations of ambition which he could feel when he held her , and he was choked with love which he could not readily express when he felt the contrast between his big , heavy , slow self and her little , thin , troubled and determined person . Mrs. Dodge lived with them wherever they went  --  Fortress Monroe , Fort Porter , Fort Leavenworth  --  until she died in 1879 . More often than not Lieutenant Mainwaring was assigned to quartermaster duties , though his branch was cavalry . This was a source of pity and annoyance to Kitty . She was glad her husband was mostly safe from hazardous duty , for then she need not worry about his safety , or about ( a buried thought ) what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on duty . But she was also cross and sorry that he was not given more dashing duties , with troops , such as all the really stylish officers seemed to have . Correspondingly , their wives seemed more stylish and dashing than she did . " There is , " she would sometimes blurt out in one of her tirades , " there really is a difference between being a storekeeper 's wife and the wife of a fighting man ! " Ted would sigh and admit it , and beg her , if she must quarrel , at least to keep her voice down so the whole post  --  Monroe , Porter , Leavenworth  --  would not know that the Mainwarings were going at each other again . At such times he just held on , remembering that after each time she let herself go , she seemed for days or weeks to be her sweetest self , and his life was again easier under her ingenious and efficient attentions . Everyone else was fond of Kitty in her " good times , " too . At such times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in the problems and needs of enlisted men 's wives , and their children , and when there was anything of a party going on in the officers ' circles , she was always to be counted on to perform small miracles of festivity . She cooked special dishes and made remarkable desserts . She had an eye and a hand for decorating tables , making place cards with her little water-color box , and arranging bouquets , and remodelingparty gowns until they looked like new . When busy with suchp117projects in such periods , she looked years younger , her eyes shone , her cheeks were hot and pink , her sharp little voice lost its edge and took on warmth and charm , and everyone would be moved to say that Kitty Mainwaring , all in all , was really a dear little thing , so capable , so useful to have around . And then , and then  --  at some fancied slight , or some vagrant recollection of what she had meant her life to be instead of what it had come to be , or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change in a flash , and their little world was turned into a prison for both of them , where they were shackled to each other and barred from happier atmospheres . Her mood would cast him down until he sank into sensations of failure . What did others think of him ? He would peer anxiously to know . Was the C.O. planning to ask for his transfer elsewhere ? The thought was enough to keep him awake at night , next to Kitty , who seemed often to sleep with angry dreams . But if the C.O. would casually happen to greet Ted with a smile or offer him a cigar or tell him a racy story , Ted would be raised by such mild acts of comradeshipto a thudding happiness and restored faith in himself ; and for the C.O. , or anyone else who showed him civility even a trifle above the ordinary , he would carry vague but powerful feelings of loyalty , even  --  hazily he would muse  --  even to the point of dying in combat for him , if such a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him anywhere , but nobody thought of him first if there was a matter of responsibility or sharp judgment to be handled . In his lumbering , pleasant figure lived an eternal boy . It was this whom others addressed when they used his nickname , " Teddy . " When the Mainwarings acquired a dog , everyone was glad . Teddy had a creature to command , Kitty a pet to love , somewhat inordinately . When they were ordered to Fort Delivery they took the dog with them , for they knew he would pine away and die if they should leave him behind , or  --  better yet in terms of sentiment  --  they knew he would set out to find them , wherever they were , as dogs had been known to do when separated from masters they adored . They always made a splendid first impression wherever they went , for they knew how to present themselves at their best until habitude and familiarity slowly wore away the exhilaration of the new , and its concealment of their troubling self-doubts . " Teddy "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanp118capacity of error . After their gusts of despisings and accusings they would humble themselves for their bad tempers , and come together again in a sort of mutual protective association , each finding in the other 's weakness a consoling image of his own . " Teddy . . . " she said , coming close to him , and sounding more than half asleep , " I made you cry , and I am sorry . I am a horrible woman . Scold me . " Her tones were seductive . She settled herself in the swells and hollows of his body . He sighed with creature comfort , and took comfortof heart from that of his flesh . His sigh was enough for her . She slept ; and so at last did Fort Delivery . But the next morning forgiveness did not emanate from the commanding officer to all those around him . He sent for Lieutenant Hazard . " Now at last he 's going to give me the troop ! " said Matthew to himself . But when he stood in the headquarters office he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment while he continued to lean over some papers on his roll-top desk which stood in a corner and thus gave the back of its user to the room . Presently , with an unconvincing start as of a man emerging from deep concentration , he turned to see Matthew , and then swung about in his highbackedswivel chair . " Well , Hazard , " he said . " Good morning . I wo n't keep you . I just wanted to let you know that on thinking it over , I believe it best for me to retain permanent command of the troop . I will also keep the first platoon , but will delegate Sergeant Fry to act as platoon commander . I have assigned the second platoon to you , as of today . Good luck with it , and do n't hesitate to bring your problems to me . " He smiled widely , which made his eyes water slightly . He seemed to plead for forgiveness after giving an order which must displease Matthew . The commanding officer , making the gestures of command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so convinced nobody else . " Yes , sir , " said Matthew . Mainwaring gazed at him . What was there about Hazard which led happily married females to put themselves out making curtainsp119for him ? Whatever it was , Mainwaring did not like it , he feared it , and deviously he must express his feeling . " Thanks , my lad , " said Mainwaring , nodding genially in dismissal . He had proved how strong he was in his weakness . The orders designating Matthew were read aloud by himself as acting adjutant at the evening parade on the same day , and in the following days he entered upon his duties with the second platoon . He had twenty-seven men . They ranged in age from nineteen to the mid-forties . Several were English-speaking foreigners from the British Isles or colonies . One was a German immigrant , two were Swedish , one was a Frenchman who had fought in the Franco-Prussian War . The remainder were native Americans . Joe Dummy was attached to the second platoon as scout . Matthew drilled his platoon separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained why to the men , and if they did not believe him , they obeyed him with some hidden flicker of smartness and pride as he put them through their evolutions across the bare , dust-drifted parade ground . He carried with him something of the flourish of the military academy . He was one used to walking beneath plumes . His figure was agent of an inner smartness of spirit ; and that spirit was proud not only of itself but also of the purpose to which it had been called . At drill Matthew was impersonal , sharp , demanding ; he saw every man at every second , or so the troopers believed . His eye was like an eagle 's . His voice was direct . It rang out in his commands and in his corrections . Walking , his shoulders were so straight and his back so arched that if his men gave even a poor imitation of him , they began to look soldierly . If he made them sweat , they sweated no harder than he . Each man had but to drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would walk in step close behind a man in ranks , and bark the cadence into his ear , and at a new command execute it in close step with him , giving advice between counts : " Hup-two-hup-four , hup-keep-hup-straight , hup-two-piece-up , hupdon't-hup-slouch , hup-two-hup-four , ve-ry-good-four , front-rankhold-down , hup-two-hup-four . " At the end of each drill period he would seat the men and discuss the day 's exercises with them , giving a critique as to a class of officers . The military culture he brought to them was that of the parade . It might not in itself be useful against enemy Indians , but it made an atmosphere of command and obedience in which could grow the harder lessons which the troopers might be called upon to apply.  |p120Re|peatedly  he obtained permission from Lieutenant Mainwaring to drill his platoon separately . The first platoon , under Sergeant Fry , performed its own drill at the opposite end of the parade ground . During drill period , Mainwaring came to look on , approve all , and return to his meager duties in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school of the horse . He was a good rider , though not a spectacular one . He began with instructions on care of the horse , and the platoon spent hours groomingtheir animals , rehearsing treatments for various sicknesses and injuries , and feeling their way to identify with them . He made them repeat almost endlessly the acts of bridling , saddling , mounting , dismounting , unsaddling , unbridling , riding bareback with hackamore , riding ( in the corral ) bareback without hackamore , making the mount lie down and rise , lie down and rise . Such exercises were performed too by the first platoon , as prescribed by regulations . But the style and energy with which Matthew pursued work made his subcommand , when compared to the other platoon , seem like an independent unit . Its tone and spirit improved daily , the incidence of sickness among its troopers fell sharply , and Doctor Gray found reason to worry . " I hesitate to speak to the young man about it , " he said to his wife , " for fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improves his own platoon , he breaks the unity of the troop , and in the long run this may be more dangerous than letting both platoons drift along at the common level allowed by that incomparableass in the headquarters office . " " Cedric . You must not shout . " " I am not shouting . I am being as murderously calm as a man can be who sees other men being mishandled . " " You are shouting inside . It is bad for you . " " I 'm damned if I 'll give Hazard even an oblique hint of advice . He just proves my case for me that troops under hard work are healthier than troops with time to think up ailments . " Inspections were occasions for further differences between the platoons . The second platoon , in barracks inspection and in troop inspection on the parade ground , had the benefit of their lieutenant 's incessant attention to detail . One day Sergeant Fry  --  a mournful young West Virginian  --  came to him and asked his help in demonstratingto the men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles in a locker opened for inspection.  | " Has the troop commander authorized your coming to me ? " asked Matthew . " No , sir . " " Why not ? " " Sir , I did n't ask him . " " Do you think you should have ? " Sergeant Fry looked soberly into the eyes of the young officer . They both knew that if the conversation went further , the soldier and the officer would come to agreement about certain matters which ought not to come clear between them . Matthew wondered if he should not refuse the sergeant 's request ; but if he did so , too much might later be made of the difference between the platoons , which would embarrassLieutenant Mainwaring . He agreed to help the sergeant . He made his demonstrations as briefly and clearly as possible and returned to his own men . From that moment , all men in the post regarded him virtually as troop commander . Discontent began to appear among men of the first platoon at the quality of their own platoon leader . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every turn , when they should have been thinking of their own work . Kitty Mainwaring knew more about the true state of feeling and opinion in the troop than her husband . She knew by watching from her piazza how matters went at drill and inspection . She knew by the behavior of men off duty as they pursued their vagrant recreations on the south line across the parade ground . She heard the conversation of soldiers on duty cultivating the post garden behind the north line . She knew by her contacts with the laundresses . These were four women who lived in their adobe rooms  --  " SoapsudsRow "  --  behind the company quarters , and who did their huge weekly washes in lean-to sheds built against the south wall of their house . The only women on the post aside from the two officers ' wives , they were amiably willing to discuss their concerns , however trivial , with the commanding officer 's wife when she came to see how their work went , and whether she could do anything for them , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant the reach and repulse ; the kindled interest and the happiness of desire ; loneliness and the hope of folly , which in their turns came to pass between so many men and so few women , isolated together under conditions of strict conventionp122so far from any other congress with their kind . One of the women was engaged to a trooper ; but under a regulation prohibiting family life to any of the enlisted men stationed at Fort Delivery , she was not yet able to marry him . Her connection was well-known and respected . The other three laundresses  --  one a German immigrant woman of twenty-six , known as Dutchy , one a middle-aged Missouriannamed Wilma , one an Irish-American woman just twenty , called Annie  --  were the objects of incessant attentions and rivalries among the troopers . Like many other states of feeling at the fort , that which existed between the soldiers and the laundresses was held in a precarious balance . The soldiers kept the laundresses , an everpresentprovocation to them , in an almost angry surveillance , to make certain that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another attitude grew out of this challenging watchfulness . It was a rude code of chivalry . Woman , so precious and rare among them , must be kept inviolate . So through hunger itself , guarded by jealousy , the barracks and washhouse society found its morality . Soldiers spoke to the women of all their concerns . They gave their views of Matthew . In turn , and with tact masquerading as absentmindedness , the women reflected these to Kitty . What she heard made Kitty suffer two pangs . One was for her husband  --  Ted , who was her substance and dimension of life , and who infuriated her at times for his Teddishness , and who made her vulnerable by his need of her . The other pang was as unexpected to her as to anyone else . It drove to her heart . It struck her with so strong a sense of Matthew 's quality , his effect on all those about him , the troopers , the laundry women , that , in her way of blushing violently and readily , she revealedeven as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood . Dutchy , Wilma and Annie exchanged a look at what they saw in her face . In their position at the fort , they had become expert at observing and estimating desire . When Kitty left them they had a raucous laugh over their tubs and washboards at her state , and then , women who felt with all women , they sent a sigh after her.  |p123She  resolved to let it make no difference . Nobody would ever know , least of all Mr. Hazard . She invited him to supper perhaps more often than before , just to prove that she could dominate the feeling that troubled her . Matthew wondered what made her so excitable during those evenings . Her natural animation was noticeably increased . She began to dress up more than usual . She made Ted tell all his stories , and she laughed so at them that she had to touch away tears with her lacy handkerchief . In her ardor there was something winning ; yet it was marred for Matthew by various flourishes of manner which seemed deliberate and therefore somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table into a pool of gaiety and amusement to which he would always want to return , she made fun of herself and everyone else . Teddy would be proud ; Matthew fascinated . Great ladies , she had heard , were given to outrageous remarks and gestures at times . She risked one now . " Mr. Hazard , " she said , half-closing her eyes to give humorous shrewdness to her prettiest expression , " everybody , simply everyone , is wondering why such an eligible young man as yourself is not married . " Some pulse sounded in her voice which betrayed to her own ear , if not to Ted 's or Matthew 's , a troubled want that underlay the idea of Matthew and marriage . " Now , Kit , " said her husband . " Nobody ever ought to ask a fellow that . Look at him . He do n't like it , and I do n't blame him . " Matthew had his head down , and his black look shone forth at her . The power of spirit behind it pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was to risk bringing up the subject . She was not a good actress , try as she would to dissemble . But with both men at her supper table leagued against her in her inquiry , she lifted her head higher and said , " You must have been told all your life that you 're handsome . You have a safe and solid career ahead of you . Plenty of girls would  --  " " I am engaged , " said Matthew flatly . " Oh . " She caught her breath with more than dramatic effect : thep124news was full of chagrin for her . She hated the woman who had betrothedhim . " When was it announced ? " She had asked him the one question which must rob his news of some of its point . " It is not exactly announced , yet , " he replied . " We will be married next year . " " But you are waiting ? You are both waiting ? " Her tone asked why . By following rapidly upon her advantages , she made less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , whether they wanted to speak or not . " Miss Greenleaf 's family thought it wiser to let me serve a year out here alone , at first . I agreed . " " Greenleaf ! " she said . " The Colonel Greenleafs ? " He nodded . " Teddy , we met them once , you remember ? They came to Monroe on an inspection .  --  My oh my , " she added , bridling on her chair with mock elegance so that her hidden silks made a little shower of sound . " You are marrying into society , I must say . " Her spirits were suddenly high , for if he had a year to wait , and if he spent it , as he must , at this post , where she was , who knew what might not come to pass , with a slightly older , still pretty , selfless and devoted woman at hand to perform for him those small attentionswhich he would miss if he ever became accustomed to them ? She knew how to be a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which appeared in complete detail before her private vision , with no sense of the infidelity to her marriage which they must imply . She felt no loss of virtue . Her cheeks were rosy . Her eyes danced . What she felt was reflected in her face . Ted stared at her . Sometimes he did not know her at all , he thought . He looked at Mr. Hazard , who saw nothing . A new sound broke into their circle . " Mainwaring ! " cried a rough voice , while a knock sounded on the front door . " I 'm coming in . " It was Doctor Gray . Ted went to meet him , and was backed into the room by the energy of the doctor , who was scowling with concern.  | " I 'm sorry to be unceremonious like this , and I hope Mrs. Mainwaringwill forgive me , but the commanding officer ought to know what I just discovered on the south line . " " Yes , captain ? " asked Ted . " I was going over a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about was Sergeant Blickner and Annie , the laundress . " " Well ? " " They have disappeared , and two horses are missing . Evidently this has been the case since mid-afternoon . If they went for a pleasure ride  --  against regulations , of course  --  ordinarily they should 've returnedby dark . " He looked at his thick silver watch . " It is now forty-three minutes past nine . That they got away without being noticed is extraordinary . That they have not come back is more than alarming . I felt certain , sir , that you should know , in order to act . " " My God in heaven , " said Ted , sinking into his dinner chair . " What do the men think ? " " Think ? " " I mean , about why they went , and where ? " Doctor Gray glanced at Mrs. Mainwaring and would not say in her presence what the men thought : that a young and vivacious woman and a hungry soldier had gone off together in search of that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty understood him well enough . She drew her breath sharply , and asked , " Doctor , what do you think could have happened to them ? " " They might have lost their way after dark , madam . However , this is not likely , when the lights of the post can be seen for thirty miles . One of their horses might have become lame , in which case they would return more slowly than they went . It is possible that they simply meant to go away and not return at all . And it is possible that if they do not return it is because physically they can not . " " Doctor , then , you think . . . " said Ted , and his face paled . " They may be dead , or captured , if Indians are about us . This we do not know , as no patrols have been ordered out for some time , as I recall . " Matthew lowered his eyes to avoid the look of pain that crossed Ted 's face on hearing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a grinding effort at self-control . " Teddy , " said Mrs. Mainwaring in a suddenly cool voice , " you willp126do whatever is wise and needful in this matter . I will leave you and your officers to decide upon it . " Turning her head in order not to see Captain Gray as she left the room , Kitty was a traveling monument to her own conception of a commander 's wife , who must use the snub when necessary . Captain Gray smiled after her in pity . " They went against standing orders ! " exclaimed Ted , taking refuge in the one fact he knew . " Indeed they did , " said the doctor . " But that is past . What next ? " " I will order out a search and pursuit party immediately , " said Ted , gathering himself as if to move . " I might suggest , sir , " said the older officer with a severe tone of official respect , " that this would compound risks to this garrison . A mounted party away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , and might be open to ambush . " " Yes , I thought of that . " Matthew had a sudden certainty now of what awaited him in this matter . Mainwaring turned to him . " Hazard , " he said , " take the best squad from your platoon , and prepare to move out just before daybreak to look for the missing parties if they have not returned . I want them back without fail . And with their mounts , too . " " Yes , sir . " They heard the front door open and close . Kitty was crossing the parade to see the remaining laundresses , to learn what she could , and to give encouragement to them for the safe return of their companion . " Thank you , captain , " said Ted . " I appreciate your action in this matter . " " You are welcome , sir , " said the doctor , and took his departure . " Sir , " said Matthew , " perhaps I 'd better interview the men to see what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , I will get ready at once . I will take my scout , Joe Dummy , with me in the morning . " " I was about to suggest it . " The acting commanding officer nodded in dismissal . His great need was to be alone for a little while , withoutanyone to observe what he did or failed to do , or to tell him what he must do.  |p127Moving  between lanterns and stars they readied themselves before daylight . The air was chilly and pure ; and when the first streak of day came like a visible waft on the eastern darkness , the sense of purity grew . Matthew breathed something of it and it plumbed deeply his tense breast and belly . He was acutely aware of all details in this , his first mission with possible enemy contact ; and as he worked , rapidly and precisely , he saw emerge under his touch the value of long and frequent practice . His squad was in proper condition . His men knew it , too . He was taking seven troopers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's supplies of food and water , even though he himself had supervised the issue and packing of these during the night . The squad carried enough rations for seven days . By lantern light the lieutenant examined arms and ammunition , the condition of hoofs , saddle girths and bits and bridles . Most of the troop awoke and came to watch the preparation and the departure . Since the recommissioning of the post , this was the first expedition to ride out on extraordinary orders . Lieutenant Mainwaring came . With him was his wife . She wore a Spanish shawl over her head and shoulders . She kept herself in the background while her husband spoke to Matthew and the squad , who presented themselves in line , dismounted , at attention . " You men , " said the acting commanding officer , " are ordered out to do a duty which is important and may be dangerous . I hope you will find and return to us the two people from our small official family who are missing . They will be punished on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have also removed without authority two valuable pieces of government property  --  thehorses they took . We must recover these , too . So you see you have something worthwhile to do . As for the dangerous part , there is a possibility that Indians may be about , and may be responsiblefor the continued absence of Sergeant Blickner and his companion . In the event of an encounter , I know you men will give a good account of yourselves . Gook luck . We 'll be waiting for you .  --  Lieutenant , the command is yours . " The officers saluted each other.  |p128Kitty  came to Ted and took his arm . " May I say a word to Lieutenant Hazard ? " There was a certain military impropriety about her request , but Ted , taken by surprise , nodded . She went forward to Matthew , who saw her just as he was about to address a command to his squad . He hesitated . She reached him in another step or two . He could see her face now in the paling day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a word , Mr. Hazard , " she said , " which may be useful to you . I talked to Dutchy and the other laundress . I asked if Sergeant Blickner had been paying any special attention to Annie . They did n't know of anything special , just about like everyone else who was a friend of Annie 's . Then I asked if she had talked about him much , and they said , not much . But they said this did n't prove anything , as they were n't with Annie every minute . " She paused . He frowned . Was that all ? She shrugged . With her mouth slightly open she made a wordless sound . It had a strange , desperate , dry quality . What on earth was the matter with her ? he wondered . She acted as though she were seeing her husband off , instead of him . " Thank you , Mrs. Mainwaring , " he said . " I 'll try to think over what you report . It may be helpful  --  " though he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she said in a low voice , " You must not misunderstand my  --  my interest in you , I just wanted to say good luck , you know . " But she searched his face with her eyes to see if a sudden kindling in him of the desire she denied in herself would appear there . " No , no , " he said politely , " of course I do n't ; and thanks for the luck . " Now he did turn away to his men , and Kitty drew her shawl across her mouth . A shudder went through her in the day 's first twilight ; she thought of Sergeant Blickner and Annie  --  desires beyond their power to control had overtaken them . To what had it brought them ? She stepped back . Matthew 's voice rang out in the command to mount . In another moment the squad was moving out at a walk following after their lieutenant . Beside him rode his Apache scout . They rode out between the corral and the forge to the open desert . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who watched behind . Only sounded the dim thud and shuffle of hoofs in dust , the twist and creak of leather , bit chains shaken by a horse . " Joe , this is your game . " Lieutenant Hazard swept his arm over the desert earth . Joe Dummy nodded . He gestured for a halt behind the corral . While the squad rested , he went slowly forward on foot . The first sunlight threw long shadows and gave brilliant relief to the very grains of the sand . He saw a wide spread of hoofprints  --  the marks of weeks made by horses taken out and brought in for drill , exercise and forage . Hundreds of crescent-shaped small low ridges threw their shadows . Amidst them Joe sought fresh prints . Walking in a pose of meditation over the hoofprints , he soon found what he wanted , and followed for ten or twelve yards until he was sure . He then gestured to Matthew to bring up the detachment . He knew where to go now . They followed him  --  he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses leading eastward . The sergeant and Annie had gone at a walk , probably to avoid attracting attention with the dust and sound of trot or gallop . After going half a mile eastward from the corral , they had turned to their left , northward , until reaching the near rim of the arroyo . At the bank , they had paused , and then , probably with the sergeant leading , and even holding on to Annie 's bridle , they had taken their mounts at a scramble down the steep , sloping , red-earthed wall , until they had found the protection of the deep dry gully . In soft sand they had ridden the arroyo bed . Presently they had taken up the trot , but not for long , perhaps because Annie had not been used to riding . At a walk they had proceeded for the next two miles or a little more , and then had taken their way out of the arroyo over the north bank . Three miles away were the low hills out of which , when rains came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replenished . The hills contained miniature ravines , long slopes , and winding hollows . Toward these Sergeant Blickner and his companion had then taken a direct course . They had once again tried the trot , and then had broken into a gallop , riding close beside each other ,  |p130with  one horse slightly in the lead , as though the sergeant had held Annie 's bridle for her protection at unaccustomed high speed . After about half a mile the gallop had come down to a walk , and then to a halt , while the riders had dismounted , and the horses had moved idly about , stamping . It had been a brief pause , yielding marks of no other action , and it had perhaps taken place to permit a catching of the breath , possibly a discussion of plans , and then a remounting . Resuming their course eastward , they had come to the rise of the hills , where they had turned first to the right , or south , and then to the left , or north , entering a shallow trough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty grass . Hoofprints now became dim , and soon vanished altogether , in a texture of the hard grass and loose but impervious white gravel . " They certainly came this far , anyhow , " said Matthew to Joe . Joe did not reply in sound , but with the fingers of his right hand tipped together he made it clear that the riders had gone farther into the shallow valley in which the squad was halted . Up there , indicated Joe , on the ridges , they would have been visible . On the slopes , they would have ridden in discomfort . The marks at the entrance of the valley had gone in only one direction : they had not come out . Therefore , he said , the squad should continue the march up the defile . Matthew gave the command accordingly . Joe Dummy turned his mouth down in a sour expression . It concealedhis satisfaction that his young commander reposed trust in his judgment . In the care of their study of the trail , the column had taken almost three hours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock in the morning , a late August day , and the light was turning from golden to white as the day advanced . The heat was already wavering off the desert crust in visible reflections , and dust was hanging forward on the drying wind out of Mexico many miles away . The defile was pale in color  --  dust lay on the rocks that jutted from the low slopes , until from some distance the rocks looked like rags of cloth or paper in the beating light , and the grass made a ragged shimmer . Grass crushed by hoofs gave up a wry , piercing odor . Ahead of them the hills time after time folded away any distant view ; but revealed with every turn of a fold another stretch of the low valley that showed nothing new : dusty rocks in random attitudes , the only surfaces to catch the light and make pale interruptions of the dusty olive green of the sharp grassed slopes.  |p131There  , said Joe , riding beside Matthew , with a movement of his crabbed arm . " Where ? " Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the light like the outcropping rocks of the whole passage  --  and yet somehow did not look quite the same . Matthew leaned sharply forward and halted the column with a hand signal . Various pale objects about sixty-five yards ahead  --  nothing in his experience preparedhim to know what they might be , even remembering all the possibilities which had brought him here . But if Lieutenant Hazard had never seen dead naked and hacked bodies lying to catch the sunlight under a dusty white sky in a desert defile , Joe Dummy had , and often . He knew what he saw . The lieutenant knew , too , soon enough . So did his men . The column approached at a walk the works left by murderers . No soldier said anything except a young Pennsylvanian ; and he said with sudden vomit what his mouth could not frame in words . Matthew glanced at him , and said , " Cranshaw , dismount here and wait for us . " The trooper , shaking in his pallor , nodded and came to a halt . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his horse 's bridle caught around his right ankle . It was most curious , thought Matthew even as he drew ahead with his attention fixed on what they had come to find , most curious how unsafe it was to predict what any given man might do in situations of unaccustomed difficulty . Cranshawwas robust , well-favored , seemingly confident . He was liked in the platoon , he had a stock of jokes and farces , and he gave freely of them to entertain his fellows . When offered alcohol he drank readily and was drunk sooner than anyone , and then , more droll than ever , he was much applauded for his blithe obscenities and music-hall turns . Matthew had already marked him for possible promotion , for he was quick and clever at his tasks , and men learned from his demonstrations at these . Now at the sight of mutilated death , he failed the rest , showing them an example of weakness . Matthew reservedhis judgment : Cranshaw perhaps must simply get used to what now the other men saw in immediate clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismounted . Matthew went forward alone with Joe Dummy . Yes , this was how , all was proper , nothing had been neglected  --  so Joe Dummy seemed to say as he took in the scene . If he heldp132views about the death of Sergeant Blickner , who had abused him , he did not reveal them . Matthew was more slow in accumulating all the details . The victims were naked . Their limbs were severed from their bodies , and slightly scattered . The woman 's body showed a mortal mercy . Powder burns close on her breast indicated that Sergeant Blickner had shot her before she could be taken prisoner . His own flesh showed bullet wounds of farther origin , and lance and knife cuts . Further specificationsof unspeakable treatment suffered by the two corpses would be reserved for the official report to the commanding officer of Fort Delivery , Matthew decided . He was pale . His lips were white , and felt stretched . He turned to his troopers and said , " Trumpeter , hold the horses . The rest of you men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . Trumpeter Rainey , holding the squad 's bridles , craned his neck . A sense of injustice possessed him . In due time it was relieved , for the lieutenant ordered the men back , and permitted him to come forward in his turn . He was the youngest man in the detachment . Matthew watched him study the recognizable pieces on the ground . The trumpeter closed his jaws and squeezed down his eyes almost shut in his hardened face . He looked twice his age for a moment . Then he glanced at the lieutenant , and nodded , and the effect was of his saying that it was the worst thing you ever could see , but if you had seen , and felt , anything of life before , this was something you just had to put along with all the rest of it , good and bad , to keep on going yourself . " Rainey , " said Matthew , " go back and bring Cranshaw up here . If he wants to see , before we decide what to do next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . " " ' S sir , " said Rainey , saluting as he went . He was more of a stylist at soldiering than the rest . Matthew moved aside with Joe Dummy . " How were they , how many , and where have they gone ? " he asked . So : this and this : they were about four in number , and they were mounted . They now had two extra horses , along with whatever arms and ammunition the sergeant had carried , and all equipment includingsaddles and food and water . They had two places to go . Onep133was there , north , to the Phantom Mountains , and one was there , south to Mexico . When did they do this ? This : and this : and so : the blood on the ground was black and that on the stumps was black and also tarry , and these , and these , where some had been eaten by creatures , out of the sky , and from the open earth , vultures up there , and here , coyotes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ; and what from far had looked like pale ragged rock catching the light , was now seen closely to be very pale blue in color ; and all such information indicated that the thing had been done yesterday during the twilight . Yes . And when did the others leave here ? So . And so . And so . Speaking from his own old customs , Joe Dummy was sure they had left very soon afterward . Once the proper things had been done , and the loot taken , there was every reason to go away from death and leave it behind . " They were Apaches , do you think ? " Oh , yes , yes . Tshaa . Nobody else . " Do you think we could ever catch them , Joe ? " Off there , that way , south , yes , they would go south for greater safety , for they had more places to hide once they were in the mountainsin Sonora , they would arrive there long before anyone who went after them , but they could be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know them ? I mean , the very ones who did it ? " One would have this , and one that  --  a U.S. Army carbine , or a Colt 's revolver , and there would be the two horses , and all the equipment . And then the scalped hair  --  they could be identified by such things . Matthew considered his duty . It embraced a dilemma in command . The bodily remains of Sergeant Blickner and Annie the laundress must be returned to the fort for burial . Should the whole squad take these back , or should one man be detailed to the task , while all the rest mounted a pursuit ? What was his stated mission ? The commanding officer had asked for the persons , and also for their horses , to be returned . Matthew believed he should recover the horses . Nothing had been said to him about capturing Apaches , if indications suggested that Apaches had been involved in the extended absence of the sergeant and his companion . But how could he capture stolen horses without taking Apache horse thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hisp134alternatives for him , Matthew also saw Rainey bring Cranshaw near the slowly shrinking objects on the dusty short grass . Cranshaw looked his fill and then turned away . Rainey put his hand on Cranshaw 's shoulder . It was like a father heartening a child . Wondering whether Cranshaw could ever take death as a soldier must , Matthew said , " He would not be the one to send back to the fort with a blanket full of remains , " and in this thought , concerning the quality of one of his men , he discovered that he had made his decision . He would detail someone to go to Fort Delivery , while with the rest of the squad he would take up the pursuit toward Mexico . He then moved rapidly . The trooper whom he designated to return to the post was ordered to lay out his blanket and two others were directed to gather upon it the remaining components of the two bodies . These were then folded tightly into the blanket which was secured with rope . The heavy bundle was lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as you can to the post , " Matthew told him , " and report in detail what we found . Tell Lieutenant Mainwaring there is no doubt at all that Apaches have been , and may still be , in this vicinity , so he can alert the post . Tell him I am going in pursuit , and that I consider myself on a war mission . I will remain in the field until I can capture the murderers and recover our horses , or as long as my supplies hold out . My course lies southwest . Keep yourself a strict lookout on your way back . Do n't halt to fight . Run for it if you are attacked . That is all . " " The school of the desert , " said Matthew to himself as they rode to the southwestward in the second day . By this he meant Joe Dummy 's instructions to him , and so to the rest of the detachment . Joe had found signs of the raiding party on that morning . They pointed to a recent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assumption that the raiders were retreating southwesterly . He showed how he made his conclusions . Horse dung , its degree of moisture ; hoof marks without other prints of heavy saddles thrown off ; the site itself , open , without even the shelter of scattered bushes such as would be desirable overnight.  |p135Moving  once again , the detachment learned from Joe Dummy how to use the faculty of vision upon the distance . The ground gave great reflected glare . Hold the forearm over the face just below the eyes to place a shadow upward instead of the unimpeded glare , and you could see much farther . He halted the detachment when a stir of dust appeared far ahead . If it drifted steadily aside with the prevailingwind , it was caused by movement of bodies . If it rose and vanished after a short while , it was a desert gust whirling upward , and meant nothing . The present flare of dust soon disappeared . The column moved on . At night they used no campfire . The guard was changed every two hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should lose more than two hours of sleep at night . The troopers slept like the dead , Matthew thought , once they were down . The guard called his relief quietly . The relief took his place with loaded carbine . He learned to see at night by using the corner of his eye instead of direct peering vision . He listened and he watched . The horses were picketed far enough way from the sleeping men so their night sounds would not disturb , and yet near enough so the guard could see them in the starlight at all times . The rations of all the troopers were gathered every night in two large saddlebags . These were placed under the care of the guard who in the event of attack from ambush could save the supply , moving with it to the picket line to be ready for emergency saddling . Night was cold on the desert . Dreams came shafting through the contractedforms of the sleeping soldiers , and made them murmur and hold themselves against the cold and against the instrusions of images induced by cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to awaken the lieutenant . When Matthew arose , he always found Joe Dummy sitting awake near him . " Do n't you ever sleep ? " he asked . Joe slept like anyone else . He knew how to sleep deeply , like a rock , for there was value in it if hard work awaited in the day . But much was astir in the hour before dawn , and it was his lifelong habit to be watchful then . That was all . " Joe , Joe , " said Matthew , laughing . The scout understood the warmth and the respect in how this was said . He understood the principle of command . He was now subject to it . He understood also the inarticulate truth of friendship . This too under the young officer 's command he was coming to know.  |p136Under  his duty as trumpeter , to whom the commander in the field would give commands to be relayed by bugle , Private Rainey rode at the head of the column with the lieutenant . There were long hours of riding when watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to converse . Trumpeter Rainey was talkative . Matthew listened to him and regarded him now and then sidewise . Rainey was artless . Anything that had ever happened to him was fit matter to tell about . Matthew put down smiles now and then , and now and then he was moved by the vividness of a place or an event which Rainey evoked with unconscious style . A commander never knew , thought Matthew , what went into the making of his men . Every one of them was different in his way from the others , and yet in their official and natural similarities of body and endowment , they were to be counted as exactly alike , for military purposes . It was a rare man who gave himself up so openly out of his past as the trumpeter . He was young , only nineteen . He would no doubt discover reticence as he grew older . This man ; those men ; the lieutenant was responsible for them ; they were responsible to him , and to each other ; community held them . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than all  --  or so he prayed in feeling beyond words . Private Rainey 's summoning up of the days when he " was young , " as he put it , gave Matthew a close sense of identity with his troopers . The trumpeter was not tall , but he was stoutly made . He gave a generally blunt effect . He often wore a scowl which looked to Matthew like an effort to focus himself  --  to give detail to his blurred face , with its freckles , and sharpness to his mind , with its youthful vapors . Otherwise he seemed like a boy much younger , afraid , for the sake of manliness , to seem too good-natured . Matthew had never heard the bugle played so truly as Rainey played it . The same true feeling came free as Rainey talked to his commander . Olin Rainey 's mother , Cleora , said to him one Saturday afternoon when he was bothering her in the kitchen , back home in Galena , Illinois , where he was born , " Olin Rainey , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doings . Sometimes I wish you 'd do instead of ask . No Ip137do n't , " she added at once . " All right , I 'll see what your father says about it . " " Do n't ask him ! " said Olin . At fifteen he was coming into a blunt-nosed power that made him try everything to have his way . " Do n't tell my dad , " he insisted . " Your dad is my husband . I 've got to . " " No , you do n't . You did n't tell him when you let Bethesda go to the magic-lantern show . " " He was n't fit to tell , that 's all why . " " Maybe he wo n't be fit to tell about me going to Poplar Grove , then . " Cleora said , " You should be a lawyer . " " No , Mordell 's more likely for lawyer . " " All right , " she said , " I wo n't tell your father . Go along . Come here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll think of what you could do for me that 'd keep you here , so go on . " She thought he did n't hear her , but he did , when she added under her breath , " And do n't come back , ever , my honey , but go on to better people and places and chances for yourself . " He had the permission he needed . It was permission to take the first trip of his life  --  to go , tomorrow , Sunday , with some slightly older friends of his in a buggy to attend an outing in Poplar Grove , Iowa . They would leave Galena , Illinois , early in the morning . It was a fine prospect . Olin knew of only one place where he could go to think about it in peace . His haven was a little open room of willows facing the Galena River which joined the Mississippi . He spent much time there on the bank of the river under the bluff on which the town of Galena rested . He often went alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys he knew . Galena was a river port where the old side-wheel steamer Menomineecalled . Olin would watch her , and imagine going away on her some day , perhaps next week , maybe next year , to steam downstream ( never upstream  --  why was that ? ) to another world where nobody knew him . He did not know what he longed to find , but he knew well enough what he wanted to get away from . His father , Ruben Rainey , worked hard in the lead mines at Galena for little pay to support his large family . They lived in a narrow red brick house on one of the streets high above the center of town . There was not room enough for everybody in comfort ; thep138family had to double up in beds , share every corner , and ( so it seemed ) apologize for their individual existences to maintain any sort of order in their horizonless world . When he looked ahead , Olin could only see himself coming home at night in his turn from the lead mines , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease of the velvety mineral which was taken out of the earth in such great quantities and yet earned so little in wages . He would like to get away from pretending that his father was not a drunkard and a braggart who refought his days in the Civil War every other night , sitting around in Ferguson 's store . If he could n't help his dad , and he did n't know how he could , Olin was ready to get gone . He would like to get away from sleeping with his brother Mordell , who was a year younger than he and skinnier , and more full of words . Like him , Mordell also wanted to be alone sometimes , but alone in a different way . If Mordell had a book  --  any old book , it seemed  --  he could be alone in the middle of everything . Mordell never minded to have the other children around  --  Jane Mary , next youngest ; then Bethesda ; then Martha Mary ; and then Benjamin , the baby . Knowing all these people better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they were practically strangers . He would like to get away from having to come home afternoons wondering " how things were , " and then having to see that look on his mother 's face sometimes , when she would go white and all but fall . He and Mordell would sometimes manage to catch her . Once she fainted sitting down and that was the worst of all . Doctor Jimson said he did n't know what caused it  --  she was just " subject " to it . Relieved to be left with only a familiar worry , they thanked him for not finding anything terrible . The doctor surely knew . He had a roomful of books and was always buying more . Finally , Olin wanted to get away from being Olin Rainey as he knew him , so he could be Olin Rainey as he wanted to be . He could not say just yet what this was to be , but his dream did not seem entirely hopeless . Somebody else had once lived in Galena and had gone away , and Olin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two streets lower toward town than the Rainey house . The man was Ulysses Grant , who in Olin 's boyhood was President of the United States . President Grant 's house was not much different from Olin 's . Years ago it was part of the town lore that Ulysses Grant , as a clerk in his brother 's harness store in Galena , wouldp139never amount to much , and the fact that he 'd proved everyone wrong did n't seem to make them any the less pleased with themselves . If they ever thought of saying the same thing about Olin Rainey , the miner 's son , perhaps they 'd be wrong there , too . Everything about going away kept Olin interested . He liked to go to the levee to watch the old Menominee come in and tie up , and unload , and load , and then cast off . Cautiously she 'd backwater with one big paddle wheel while the other went slow-speed ahead . He cocked his head to hear the bell signals somewhere deep inside her . The dark water by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reflection shattered and broke . Birds flipped up from treetops back of the shore . The Menominee let go with her whistle and began to pick up speed , letting the water come back to black glassy stillness . Her twin stacks side by side rose high in the air and ended in iron crowns blackened by smoke . Her windows looked black except where the fancy curtains showed , looped apart . Her deck was only a little way above water . People on deck walked close to the water . If only he were on board , Olin would lean over all day long and watch the water go by under him as he went away . Sometimes he would go to his willow brake to watch the Menominee as she trundled herself downstream like a wide duck on the sailing current . He saw the steamer safely receding into the engulfing light until she vanished . He always went there to watch her away as she took some part of him along . At other times he kept returning to his grove of river willows for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to listen . He liked to sort out the river sounds . There were all kinds , once he listened for them separately . The difference between the sound of water close in to the bank , and water far out in the stream . The kinds of wind , high or low , in branches or in grass . What a steamer whistle did upwind and downwind . Best of all , the songs of birds . Olin would listen with his cheek turned toward a bird singing somewhere , and then he would try to imitate it , whistling . Then he would wait for an answer . It was some time and many visits to the river before he got his first answer , and when it came , he fell down on his little floor of damp river grass and hugged his ribs and rolled over and back , laughing fit to be tied . When he got his breath hep140stood up and tried again , and again the bird answered him . From that time on , so true and pure was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to . He did not say so to himself , and nobody else knew , of course , but this was music . He was trying to make music , using the only instrument and the only teachers within his reach . But there were other tunes , and he practiced these too , and on that Saturday afternoon when he had his permission to make the excursiontomorrow , he went down the river to his place , and after a few exchanges with whatever old birds happened to be around , he set to work practicing his best pieces . He began with " The Brown Eyes Polka , " and worked his way through " Tenting Tonight " and " Darling Nellie Gray " to the " Boston Waltz . " It seemed possible that tomorrow , on the way , or actually at Poplar Grove , someone might want to hear him whistle . He meant to be good and ready . " On Sunday morning four buggy-loads left for Poplar Grove , " said Trumpeter Rainey to Lieutenant Hazard as they rode , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all going to attend the band festival which was staged every few years in springtime by members of the Poplar Grove Bohemian colony . The understanding was that if Olin would help to care for the horses and make himself generally useful , he need not worry over expenses , for his friends would see that he got fed . The rest of them were paired off boy-and-girl . Olin had never been out with the young people before . They thought it was high time . The trip over saw the birth of his social sense . " Well , let 's all do our part , " they said to him . " Can you tell us a story ? How about a riddle . Can you sing ? " No , but he could entertain with his whistling . " Your what ? " He showed them . The buggy horse pricked up his ears and so did they . First he gave them birds . The sweetness and wit of this made them laugh with delight . Then he tried his real tunes , and on thep141inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds with these , and they all said the effect was way downtown . They applauded . " Let me show you , lieutenant , " he said to Matthew , and demonstratedhow he mixed bird songs with real tunes . The horses in the column , and the troopers , lifted their heads to listen . Just so , on the ride over to Poplar Grove , he had lifted the spirits of the young people . He also released their real reason for making the trip to Iowa . Much sparking and daring came out between the young men and women of the party . Olin caught his first glimpse of courtship . It made him wonder and then it made him more secret than ever with his feelings which , under suppression , were dear and bothersome . One of the girls took a liking to him and pretended to prefer him to her fellow , just to bring advantageous jealousy into the air . Olin 's head swam . Shucks . He grinned . His features felt as though they blurred together at what he felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unkindly . He gripped his hands together between his thighs . He felt far from home . But the band festival wiped out all his other new excitements . Several bands competed in the festival . He listened to them all . The greatest , and the winner , was a band of silver valve comets  --  the John Huss Silver Cornet Choir . He had never imagined , much less heard , such beautiful sounds . He followed the players around when they were through , and finally got up enough nerve to ask one of the younger musicians to let him see his silver cornet . " Here , you want to hold it ? " Olin took it and pressed the sparkling valves with their inviting action cushioned on little trapped columns of air . He held it to his face as if to play it , and then lowered it . " Go on , try it once , " said the young Bohemian . " I do n't know how . " The player showed him how to fix his lips , inflate his cheeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked noises which embarrassedhim . The owner nodded with encouragement and he tried and tried again , until he heard himself blow a long , pleasant , if somewhat breathy , tone . " Good . Good , " said the cornetist . " You 'll catch on easy ! " The leader of the choir was nearby . He came over and smiled generously at Olin 's first trial . Then , taken by what he saw in the boy 's face , he asked him if he would like to learn to play the trumpet . Olin blushed and nodded . He felt like a bump on a log.  | " Here , there , " said the leader , " you come over here , once , " and led him to a grove of trees away from where the festival crowd were eating their picnic . Right then and there the professor gave him a lesson on the comet , and when they were done , he said that Olin Rainey had a natural talent for music and for the cornet , and added , " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you tell them to get you lessons . " " Thank you . " Olin knew the thing was hopeless . Why did anybody have to want what they could n't have ? When he came back to Galena from Poplar Grove he was somebody else . His mother recognized this at once , for she had known well who he was when he went , and now he could see her wondering what kind of somebody else he was who came home from the outing she had let him have , for which she had had to pay dearly over the weekend . Olin did n't say anything , but on Tuesday afternoon his mother came into the kitchen and saw him with her china beehive in his hands . " Olin Rainey ! Drop that , no do n't drop it , give it here to me , you  --  oh ! " In the china beehive was the money she had saved . It was the treasure she kept against calamity . He handed it to her and she boxed his ear . " I was not stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting it . " Now over her fright , she saw he told the truth . " What for ? " she asked . " To see if there was enough for us to get me what I saw down in Mr. Ferguson 's store window . " " And just what is that ? " " A secondhand valve cornet . " She folded her hands across the beehive against her bony breast and stared at him . So this was what had happened to him in Poplar Grove . Music . And all the while she 'd figured what else . She nodded and in a few words he told her what he had discovered on the outing . He knew he could speak to her without sounding like a fool , and all his longing became an open secret between them . " How much is it ? " she asked . " Nine dollars and four bits . " She did not have that much money . It may as well have beenp143thirty-five dollars so far as the beehive was concerned . It angered her and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you any nine dollars and four bits . And what if one of us fell sick ? Medicines cost money . And what if Bethesda or Benjamin or the others need clothes to keep walla ? Or what if your father gets taken so he ca n't work for a while and then who buys what I must cook for my hungry mouths ? Just so you can have a brass horn to make noises on ! You may be the oldest , but that do n't fit you to have everything and the rest nothing ! Do you know who is always after me to buy him books ? Mordell is , that 's who . Did I , though I would if I rightly could ? No ! " She went to the closed shelves and put the beehive back where she always hid it . " I 'm not going to hide it in a new place , " she said , " for I trust you . " " Yes , you do , yes , and you can . " Her eyes suddenly held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to ask that much for it . " " Yes . I asked him . " " He always was near . " Like other discussions which skirted crisis in that family , this one ended only in a gradual settling back of silence , and of old familiar troubles . To Olin these seemed sharper and more hopeless as new discoveries came his way . The next time a steamer arrived it was not the old Menominee which , they said , was laid up for repairs downriver . It was the United States mail and passenger packet New St. Paul , a younger , grander ship . When she came in , Olin was at the levee , for she tied up after school . The channel was narrow and she lay athwart it at a long angle . Her bow touched the shore , and dockhands first unloaded her from the bow and then took new cargo up along inclined planks . From the side she looked like a two-story store front with wooden galleries . On top was a deckhouse and on this again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just behind it rose her twin stacks tall and black . Her side wheels were encased in great half-drumsp144which carried her name . Somewhere down under breathed her engines , asleep and softly hissing out steam . Olin tilted his head . There was another sound . He came closer . What would they do to him if he ran up the planks ? Perhaps he could find a bundle of some sort to carry which would justify his going aboard . For a moment he hesitated to take the risk ; but what he heard pulled at him , and then , scowling forcefullyand striding like a man , he simply walked straight across the levee , fell in between two work parties , and marched right up to the foredeck of the New St. Paul . Once there he continued the march until he was inside the main saloon cabin where he found the source of the sound that called him . It was the sound of a square pianoforte . Framed by yellow velvet draperies looped with gold ropes and tassels , the piano occupied the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent steamboatroom . An old man who looked like Andrew Jackson in the history book was making long fancy glides on the keys . When he reached the top he would linger and tremble his fingers until Olin was dazzled by the brilliant blur of sound . Then he would swoop downward to the thunder of the other end , and scowl , and make rumbles , and grind his teeth , sinking his narrow , bony , loose-skinned chin inside his stand-up collar . Knowing someone was listening , he played all the grander and harder . Even if he knew it was only a boy , he had to show what he could do , and at one point he rose off his cut-velvet piano stool and flipped out his coattail as if it were part of the music and came down again on the stool and suddenly went limp . He rolled his eyes to heaven and then shut them and made a pursed smile and his fingers played like gentle rain on the keys , and he seemed to show that he could be a poet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woke up , and asked Olin , " Well , what can you do , now ? " " No , I ca n't do anything . Except listen . It surely was mighty fine . " The artist shook his head and showed his long , yellow , horse teeth in a sad smile . " Oh , it was , once upon a time . It was , for certain . These hands have played before crowned heads and they have won gold medals and scrolls at many an international exposition of science , art and industry . But what are they doing now ? Playing storm effects andp145moonlight mush for passengers who hardly listen on a moth-eaten old Miz'sippi steamboat . " " I do n't think she 's moth-eaten . I wish I was on her . " " Could you earn your way ? " " I do n't know doing what . " " I lost my orchestra at Natchez last month , by which I mean my horn player . Can you play a cornet ? " Olin 's heart took a jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn . " " I can teach you , if you have a comet . " Olin felt like crying for the first time in many years . " I do n't have one . I know where I can get one , but it costs too much . " " What makes you think you could play it , anyway ? " " The bandmaster at Poplar Grove told me I could learn . " " Well , he probably knows . Can you do anything else with music ? " " Well , it is n't music , just like that , but I can whistle . " " Then whistle . " The pianist turned to his keys and began to make up music that called for birds in the trees . Olin , at first hesitantly , then more confidently , began to do his birds . In a very short while the two performerswere one in creating a kind of music that went right along . " Try this ! " cried the pianist without pausing , but switching to a real tune which Olin knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melody , but he kept his birds in too , and the result moved the old man to stand up and clap his hands once or twice . " You 're an entertainer ! " he sang out . " What 's your name ? I am Professor McKlarney . Whistling wo n't do forever , but if you can learn to do as much on the trumpet , you 'll never starve ! " " Olin Moresby Rainey . I can learn it . " " Oh , my gracious , how I need a trumpeter ! That 's all they 'll listen to when they get to really having a good time on board .  --  Do you drink ? " Olin was both complimented and shocked at this . " No , sir . " " Well , that 's a relief . I lost my last one through drink . But what 'm I saying . I ca n't take you . Oh , you could come along and whistle , but that would do only till you learned the cornet . And you have n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Professor McKlarney knew too much of old disappointments top146spend much time on new ones . He shrugged his bony shoulders , swept his long gray hair out of his collar , and sat down as if to resume his study of music . " If you ever get a horn , speak to me again , " he said , and began to exercise his hands in octave scales . There was a short , shaking blast from the steam whistle of the New St. Paul . The professor angled his head at Olin to tell him to get off  --  they were about to sail . Olin left him , taking along the remarkable knowledge that he was  --  according to a professional  --  an entertainer . With him , too , went the sorrowful certainty that nothing could be done about it . That night at home they all held their breath . It was past nine and the father had not yet come home . They all knew , even little Benjamin , that when he came , matters would be much worse even than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the mother . Her face was white and when she smiled to ease their fears they could have sobbed drily . Olin and Mordell stayed close to Cleora and moved still closer when they heard footsteps on the porch . They were firm steps , slow , heavy and important . Ruben Rainey when at his worst acted deliberately . His rages built themselves up out of the depths of his wounded silence . For a long time he would not say a word , but only hang his head forward and stare at them all in turn . His silent accusations were borne along his hot , redrimmedgaze which looked as if it must hurt him as it left his eyes . Though he was powerfully built , his menace was something beyond body . He came in this night and spoke to nobody but went and sat at the kitchen table . " Would you have your supper now ? " asked Cleora . He shagged his great head about to see her and made no reply . His head swayed forward and back slowly , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons to go to bed . The younger children were already upstairs , but wide awake , listening for the fury which sooner or later must explode.  | " Not him . Him , " said Ruben , indicating that Mordell was to leave , but Olin was to stay . Cleora nodded and Mordell departed , walking backward until he was in the dark of the narrow steep hall . His stomach tasted in his throat . If his father struck his mother tonight , just this once more , he would come flying down the stairs and do his best to kill his father . With this resolve it was possible for him to leave as ordered . In the kitchen nothing moved but the brass pendulum of the walnut clock on the shelf above the sink . Olin knew that his father had been aggrieved for days because he had gone to Poplar Grove . He knew that his mother was still in danger for having let him go . His guilt was unbearable and it moved him to speak . " It was n't her fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go and not tell you because I thought you would say no if we asked you . " A look of weary sweetness came over Ruben 's work-grimed face and lingered there briefly . At last the excuse had come to him to break the hard thick shell of his own trouble . " Come here , " he said to Olin , almost lightly . Olin glanced apprehensively at his mother as if to ask whether to obey . " Do n't look at her , " said Ruben thickly but in a gentle voice . " Just come here to your father . " Olin went to him . As he went , he watched his father 's heavy arm draw back to gather the distance from which it would strike him when he was near enough . When the arm was as far back as it wanted to be , Ruben 's face went broken and wild . His body tensed stiff as iron , braced to destroy . His voice let go with a shout . He smashed Olin to the floor with one strike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bellows blasting out the sounds of his humiliation and his hatred before the whole world . Olin bled . He put his young arms across his head , his face , but still he bled . The house shook the small hearts upstairs . " Not good enough , are we , " bellowed Ruben and struck again . " Get away whenever you can , hey , " and struck . " Go crawling around asking the price of a valve cornet , will you , " and slapped his son with an open hand like a hickory board , " when nobody here has enough to eat , hey ? "  |p148Olin  on the floor assumed protectively the shape of an unborn child . His mother came to cover him . " You , " cried her husband , and sent her across the room with a crashing swing . The air was rank with the breath of the corn whisky which had brought him home as temporary master of his world . In the door appeared Mordell . He saw Cleora pulling herself upward by holding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yelled , " for if he did , I will kill him ! " Ruben Rainey heaved himself aback and stared at his second son . Anger went soft and melted into grief . He sank against the table , covered his face and wept aloud in a hooting voice for the son who would kill his father . Upstairs the little ones clutched each other and hugged with relief . Like Olin , they knew that the nature of the terror below had changed , and that presently peace would descend , after the father had been hauled to his bed as if never to awaken again . When Ruben was safely lost in sleep , Cleora came to the boys ' bed and , as she expected , found Olin awake . She took him quietly away , in the dark , to the kitchen , and lighting no lamp , she bathed his cuts and bruises with cool water , as if to bathe his beaten heart . As she worked , she held a whispered conversation with him . " We 've got to fix it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't have waited for tonight to know it . " " Go where ? " " Anywhere . Ca n't you think of where to go ? I know your father . He 's got his mind set now about you . It 'll only get worse the longer you stay . " " Why does he hate me . " " He do n't hate you sober , son . He just ca n't stand to know he ca n't be what he would be to you if he could . He sees you 're a man , just about , and it makes him feel less a man . I do n't know . I do n't know . " She spoke in mysteries , but never had she failed him in her good sense , and he tried to know what she meant . " Where can you go , Olin ? "  | " I could have gone today , only I could n't . " " Where ! " He told her about Professor McKlarney , the want of a valvecornet , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said I would never starve if I could learn the horn . " " Do you figure he meant it , or was he just talking for talking ? " " I figure he meant it . " She gasped between a laugh and a catch of her breath and put her cheek to his brow for a moment of hidden leave-taking . Then she got them both to their feet and said , " Go to bed and sleep , my honey . It may take a bit to fix everything , but whatever it 'll have to happen afterward , it 'll be worth it . " He was so drowsy with assuagement and love that he hardly heard her , and only remembered her words when the New St. Paul was reported to be scheduled for Galena again on the following Wednesday . On that morning , Cleora said to Olin as he was about to leave for school with his lunch in a newspaper packet , " Come home at noon . " He held up his sandwich and gave her his best look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you 've got your lunch . But you come on home . Alone . " When he came at noon the house had another of its particular stillnesses . This one was created by young children who were told to stay upstairs in the bedroom with the door shut no matter what . As he came to the house , he heard her start to make busy noises , slamming this and shoving that , like a woman working so hard she do n't know which way to turn . So it was that she managed to look cross when he stepped in , and the slapped-at tears on her face might have been beads of honest sweat . She hardly gave him a moment to turn around , but said straight off , " Now Olin Moresby Rainey , you take this bundle . " She reached it out from under the kitchen table . He took it . It was a bundle of a few of his clothes , tied with twine . It was heavy because of something inside it . She went on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I asked and they told me down to the levee . Now you go and keep yourself somewheres out of sight till she comes in . Do you know a place to go ? " " Yes . I have a place by the river . "  | " Well , wait there till she 's ready to go off again , and then you run lickety-split and you climb on , and go find your piano professor , and you just tell him yes : there you are : you have come to work for him . You know what 's inside that bundle . First I went to the beehive and took some out . Do n't look so , there 's some left . Then I got Mr. Ferguson to give the cornet to me to pay the rest on it so much a week and when you 're rich and famous you can send me some money to make it up . You stay out of sight , now , hear ? And if the New St. Paul keeps coming back to Galena , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she will , once the Menominee is back on the run . " " Mother . " " I know . I know . Now do n't you go to saying it . It 's hard enough as ' t is . " She opened a cupboard . " Now here 's some extra sandwiches to tide you over . And here "  --  she reached in her apron  --  " is what can be spared out of the beehive to start you off in the world . " He reached for her fisted money and then broke against her in a wild hug . At the moment when she gave him the freedom he longed for , he would not go . She kissed him hard and set him away . " Go on , my honey . Do n't you let me see you till you can come back stronger than all of us . " She took him to the door and put him out . He went down the hill and turned to see if she was watching . She was not . He knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumpeter Rainey fell silent , thinking about something he heard a long time afterward from his family . " After I left home that day , " he said to Matthew , " she waited till she heard the whistle blow on the New St. Paul and she knew I was safely gone . Then she fetched out her china beehive again , and took out what was left . It was two dollars . Then she marched down to Doctor Jimson 's office , and she said , no , she told him , it 's not for me , I 'm not sick , she said , but I want you take this two dollars here , she said , and next time you send for books , Doctor , send for a two-dollar book for my son Mordell Rainey , to read and keep , and help him on his way for the way he wants to be , she said , when the time comes .  --  That 's the kind of woman she was , sir . " Matthew nodded seriously . It was enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was moved to hear of a mother like that , and maybe , even , was thinking about his own.  | " I told everyone I was twenty , " said Rainey , " and nobody believed it , but I felt like it soon enough . " " How did you ever get into the U.S. cavalry from a Mississippi steamer ? " asked Matthew . The trumpeter sighed strenuously . " Just the way life does you , " he said , with every accent of a personally earned philosophy . " I made good money for several years , and then Professor McKlarney took sick and died , and I lost everything I had , waiting to get a new job . I was every kind of a danged fool , sir ; I had too much freedom all of a sudden . Gambling and likker and women  --  one woman specially . Anyhow , I knew it was time for me to straighten up . I enlisted . They sent me to Fort Sheridan , someone heard me blow a cornet , and before I knew it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The rate of their progress toward Mexico was difficult for the troopers to measure or even observe . They proceeded mostly at a walk , mounted . So seen , the ground passed slowly by beneath them , and the distance showed no change even to the fixed gaze . The only sense of advance they could know came through spending the hours with no regard for accomplishment . Sighting mountains far to the southwest in the morning , the soldiers if they looked at them again in the late afternoonsaw a slight alteration in the mountain outline . Matthew could imagine that he had remained stationary , and that sometime during the day some great hand had given a quarter-turn to the row of mountains without bringing it any nearer . But he recognized his progress , to which his patience was exactly equal , with none left over . Joe Dummy cautioned him against a pursuit too close . It would be as unfortunate as a pursuit too slow . " Too slow , " Joe had made plain , " would lose the quarry for good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away . They would watch to see if it came for them , however , far and slowly . If it did , they would make a plan to meet , and then they would scatter and disappear , and nothing would come of this pursuit . " Matthew accepted the advice of superior experience ; and , in hisp152private impression of it , the pursuit crept forward halfway between everything ahead and behind . His men were generally at ease , if not entirely comfortable . The heat was great . The dust made thirst , and water was rationed . Few of the troopers had ever ridden so far at a time . Some developed raw skin from the chafing of thigh and calf . Matthew inspected such damage during the hourly halts . The men wanted to put water on the hot sore areas , but he refused permission . Water was precious , and besides , the abrasion would heal sooner if kept dry . He ordered them to tie their yellow silk neck cloths around the sore limb to ease the sliding contact between skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sky-blue kersey . " When the soldiers asked if they might remove their dark-blue flannel shirts for coolness under the sun , the lieutenant refused permission , telling them that thick cloth , even if it trapped heat , kept the body cooler under direct sunlight than air itself . They grumbled at believing him , but believe him they did . They knew already that as he gave them care , he would give them safety , fairness and bravery when these too should be needed . He knew them well by now . He felt their tempers without working to do so . Generally these remained good  --  though he wondered now and then about Cranshaw . Cranshaw was not yet his entertaining self . He seemed thoughtful since the discovery in the hills . When Matthew would catch his eye he would smarten in his saddle , and with a pleading look to let his moment of chicken-heartedness be forgotten , he seemed to make himself brave , worthy and personable for the eye of his commander . Matthew heartened him with a nod and a wink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cranshaw was again downcast . Perhaps he should have sent him back after all , to Fort Delivery , on the squad 's mortal errand . He shrugged . There was nothing to be done about it now but adjust a balance between hardship and the available comforts . Chief of these was " Rio " coffee , which the soldiers drank at every meal but supper , when Joe Dummy would allow no campfire for the smoke that would stand forth in the low rays of the setting sun and the cooling air which rose from the desert . The coffee was boiled until all its natural flavor was gone . They carried no tea , for this was famous as " the laundress ' drink , " and the troopers were selfconsciouslytruculent about showing indulgence for the slightest effeminacy in their own habits . Baking powders and lime juice werep153included in the rations of the expedition  --  Doctor Gray had seen to that , with a word to Matthew about the value of both starches and antiscorbutics on a long march away from garden vegetables or canned fruits with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column was near enough to Mexico to be ready , if the command were given , to cross the border during the following morning . News of this came to Matthew from Joe , and Trumpeter Rainey heard it too . Presently the whole squad knew it . In their various ways they made their acts of inner readiness . Darkness fell without a moon . The moon was waning and would rise late and lean its misshapen way over the heaven and persist into the next daylight . Between all the men of the detachment there was a sense of unspoken mystery . Matthew felt it on his own account , and also on theirs . They were thinking that tomorrow they might enter Mexico . What they would find there they could not imagine in any clear detail . But they felt that this would be a fateful step , and contemplation of it filled them with awe and wonder . What came into their minds with power was the exact recollection of what had been done to two members of their community by the creatures they now pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not in thought see his own flesh crawl as if those horrors had happened to him and might yet happen , if the Apaches were engaged and should win . But no man spoke of this or showed open concern . They made camp under the lieutenant 's direction and waited for his designation of the guards for the four watches of the night . The roster was taken in strict rotation as to which four men went on duty  --  all knew that on this night they would be the lieutenant himself , who took his turn in order to bear every burden of the common hardship , Joe Dummy , Trumpeter Rainey and Private Cranshaw . What was yet to be announced was the order of their watches . During his supper of cold biscuit , cold bacon and canned apricots , Matthew considered his decision . The most important watches werep154the first and the last . The Indian enemy almost never attacked in full night , but in early night he might be making observations , and in the hour before dawn he might fall upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , decided Matthew , and told his men so , " Joe the scout will take from nine to eleven . I will take from eleven to one . Cranshaw will take from one to three . Rainey will take from three to five . We will march at five thirty . Get all the sleep you can . Wake up promptly to relieve the guard who wakes you . He wants his sleep as you do . Be especially careful to watch the picket line . Call me at any time if you observe anything the littlest bit suspicious . We 're getting closer . We 've got something to do . We 'll do it , but only if every man does his share . I 'll say this , I never saw a better squad . " They hungered after his words , and when he praised them , they held their faces still , forgetting that the young officer had never before had a squad . They lived in his serious regard for them , and accepted it as their due . The night was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satisfaction . Joe Dummy was the right man to guard the first watch . He could see shadows on the desert even where no moon shone . Matthew himself would span the midnight when the moon would rise . For the following watch , when least responsibility would be required , Cranshaw was the right man to assign , since even if weak he must do his share , and be given a chance to heal his inner wounds of that fear which he had helplessly exposed . As for the dawn guard  --  Rainey 's story had given Matthew a rooted confidence in him . The trumpeter had become a man , a survivor of ambition , sorrow and folly , early in life . He could deal with the world as he found it , even if it brought danger . Between three and four o'clock the lieutenant was awakened by a rough hand on his shoulder . He came awake and bolt upright instantly . Joe Dummy was by him . " Joe ! What is it ! "  |p155Joe  was faintly visible in the waning moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard . " No guard ! " exclaimed Matthew . " Where is Rainey ! " Rainey was still asleep . Nobody had awakened him . " But I put Cranshaw on duty myself , " said Matthew , rising . " He was to call Rainey . " He called out , " Cranshaw ! " over the sleeping figures . The men awoke . Nobody answered the name . Cranshaw was absent . " What time is it ? " asked Rainey thickly . The air was still cold . The men shivered as they felt it in their waking . Matthew asked , " Does anybody know where Cranshaw is ? " There was no reply . " Very well . Trumpeter , it is your watch . It is about ten minutes to four . Take up your post . " " Yes , sir . Where are the rations ? " Matthew indicated the sentry post where he had established the collected saddlebags between the camp and the picket line and which he had himself guarded earlier . In a moment Rainey called out from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Matthew joined him to see . There was something to see , and more to think . Half of the rations of the detachment was missing . In a moment they discovered that one of the horses was also gone . Cranshaw had deserted during his watch . " No wonder he did n't call me ! " said Rainey . " Which way did he go ? " asked Matthew . In the faint darkness Joe Dummy made a slow wide circle with his arm . It said that Cranshaw could have gone to the rim of the world along any line from this point at the center . In the darkness nobody could tell . They must wait for daylight to read the ground . To be trapped by the night did not improve Matthew 's temper . He was filled with rage almost to sickness by the corporate hurt done to his command by Cranshaw 's breach of moral law . That a man for whatever ends of his own could steal from his comrades half of the stuff they needed to survive in the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal , sickening part of the event . The other , official part was that a soldier doing duty in the fieldp156should desert on approaching the enemy . Cranshaw running away from something which no one could name was also running straight toward the hardest judgment of which the Army was capable in peacetime . Matthew sent the remaining troopers back to sleep , if they could sleep , and Rainey continued his guard . Joe went to kneel at the outskirts of the camp watching for light in the east . Matthew sat on a blanket and came to new decisions . His total rations on marching out were meant to last the squad seven days . This was now reduced by Cranshaw 's theft to half that time . The pursuit into Mexico must be abandoned because of inadequatesupplies . A new pursuit must be taken up  --  Cranshaw must be found and taken under arrest to Fort Delivery . The deserter had changed the mission of the detachment and its conditions of living , and even its internal relations , for some of the troopers with supreme bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his bad faith . One or two others felt more lenient . They talked in low voices . They said he was not himself . They said they did n't entirely blame him for feeling the way he did , though they would never have gone as far as Cranshaw in acting upon his feelings . " You men : " said Matthew sharply after allowing the talk to continuefor a few minutes , " settle down and get all the sleep you can . You 'll need it . " The camp was quiet but wakeful . Matthew gazed at Joe , and saw him lift his shoulders and head toward the sky . In dim silhouette he looked like a wolf or a coyote making silent expression of doleful meaning . But he was sampling a new condition of the air which was making its way so gradually that no one else perceived it at first . Joe came to Matthew , and gestured toward the leaning moon . He wafted air toward his nostrils with his hand and sniffed audibly , like a dog intent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moon . It was beginning to dim . It was held in veils of air thickening toward the wide darkness . It looked like a great airy misshapen pearl in rings of nacreous dust . A vast dust storm was rising out of Mexico , and its first breath was the scent in the air of fine acrid particles of drifted earth . The scent alone was what Joe Dummy had first detected . Soon the dust itself could be seen . Joe showed with turbulent motions how the storm would grow and grow , until by full morning nothing could be seen.  | " How long will it take to blow over ? " asked the young officer . Joe showed one , two , maybe three days , with fingers . Who could say ? It would have to last until it was over . " Well , we will look for Cranshaw anyway , " stated Matthew . " Find me a trail if you can . " They found one with daylight . It showed tracks leading westward , toward the path of the setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once beyond earshot of the camp he had taken up the gallop . His lead in distance would be even greater than his lead in time , for the detachment still proceeded at a walk . This was required by Joe Dummy , who pointed out that a march at high speed  --  sustained trot or long gallops  --  would cost the horses and men the loss of much perspiration . With reduced water rations , this could be dangerous . " But he might get entirely away from us , " protested the lieutenant . No , said Joe , they would find him . You could always find what you were after in the desert if you kept after it long enough , and knew what to look for , in what places . " We 're going to be short of food in two days , " said Matthew . Joe looked at him with a flat face . His meaning , which came through , was that men could live much longer on nothing than they thought they could  --  even white soldiers without all the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full storm was upon them . The sky was filled from rim to rim with flying heavy dust . The wind was strong . It drove the dust into the skins of the troopers , stinging . It choked their nostrils and mouths . They made mud about their eyes with tears stung forth by the hot wind and the driving dust . The ground was swept steadily and the marks of the trail were obliterated . With their heads down , the soldiers marched westward . Once or twice during the morning the sun came to sight in rifts of the sandy cloud that coveredall . The sun was like a disk of pale blue metal . The dust closed over it soon again . " Is there any shelter anywhere about here ? " cried Matthew into Joe 's ear . It seemed that there was a low mesa , called Bear Mesa , along their westerly course . If they could find it in the storm , they could come to its north side and be protected from the worst of the blow . If Cranshaw happened upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let us try to find it , " ordered Matthew . Though he showed it to no one , a bitter concern filled him . The one faculty which made search useful in the daytime desert  --  sight itself  --  was now useless . The dust blizzard benefited only the deserter who had nothing to lose by riding on , no matter what conditions descended from the sky . Matthew doubted the value of leading his men on a blind pursuit . Further , he was filled with a sense of failure . On his first expeditionagainst the enemy in the field he was obliged to abandon his mission because of a crime against the Army by one of his own men . He felt blame for the crime . Cranshaw had shown weakness in his presence . Why had he trusted him ? He saw now that an experienced commander would have handled Cranshaw altogether differently . Matthew , by treating him like all the rest , had hoped that he would behave like all the rest . It was a grave miscalculation . Its consequences could be serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would have a sorry report to make to his acting commanding officer when he returned to Fort Delivery . The wind was like an oven breath . The dust thickened toward noon . They halted for a brief meal . The horses faced away from the driving wind , and the men crouched with their backs to it . When it was time to resume the march , Matthew asked his scout , " Where is west ? " Joe indicated it . " How do you know ? " asked Matthew . There were no shadows , the sun was gone , the day was placeless and all pale-colored like the tawny fur of a mountain lion . " Well , I know , " replied Joe . Matthew took his word for it . They mounted and moved out again . " The mesa , " said Matthew . " How much farther ? " Joe did not know , but he expected to see it by now . He was lookinghard for it , because he felt certain that Cranshaw would have seen it and taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mesa had many little depths in its cliffs where someone could hide . Joe Dummy had used it long ago . If it had rained here recently , there would be water in basins where animals and men could drink . An hour later the air cleared a little . The distance was extended . As the light turned from sand color to white , lines of the earth a few miles away became visible . Joe Dummy swept the limited horizon , and then halted.  |p159There  . Behind them . Bear Mesa . They had passed it in the thick of the storm . It rose sharply at each end and showed a flat top about a third of a mile long and a hundred feet above the surrounding surface . Even in clear weather it could be hidden by the swell and hollow of the ground over distance . Now the storm was not yet over . If they were to use the mesa they should go to it now . Matthew ordered the column about . They rode to Bear Mesa . Their spirits came lighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the threatening monotony of the overblown day . They came to the mesa 's west end and rode around to its north side . It was mid-afternoon . Under the north cliffs there was an effect of hollowed calm , for the wind and dust drove over the edge and came scouring down to earth at some little distance from the base . Matthew dismounted the soldiers to rest for a little while . He let himself back upon a rocky slope and shut his eyes wearily . His weariness was more in his thoughts than his flesh . He did not sleep , but the feeling was one of sudden awakening when he smelled on the air a new clear scent . He sprang up . He smelled rain . He looked at Joe , who nodded . Rain was coming from the south behind the dust . Let everybody come to work , Joe asked . The men joined him . He showed them where to place small rocks and how to pack these with loose earth , to make rims for catching rain water at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could fill their canteens after the shower . It was wise to be ready for the water . The day turned dark . It was a blue darkness and it drove away the thick continuing squall of the dust which choked the eyes , the mouth , the very skin . The sky roared with the coming downpour . The drying heat of the air gave way to chill downdrafts off the mesa top . Matthew put his men in shelter under rocky flanks of the mesa clefts . With sudden pounding energy the rain came down the north side of the mesa as the cloudburst moved across the flat top . A trooper gave out with a yell of excitement and thankfulness for the cooling rain . The others turned to see him . He was hauling off his shirt , and then his boots and breeches , and in a moment he was bare . He thrust his clothes into the rain shadow of a big rock and he ran out into the thick downpour . The soldiers glanced at Matthew to see what he thought of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own shirt . The rest took this for a signal . All but Joe Dummy were in another minute standing forth under the cold pounding rain ,  |p160bathing  their stifled skins and breathing the wet rain and sweetened air . The scout remained in his shelter squatting with his arms about his knees . The transported men refreshing their hot , dirty , bare bodies in the sluicing rain looked to him like witless boys taking uselessexercise . Lightning split the sky over the mesa and thunder shook the rocks . The soldiers cried back at the elements and capered with joy . Joe briefly prayed them free of danger in their folly of defying the powers of the sky . The mesa was like a palace of rock . Here they should stay the night , said Joe Dummy . So : the water now caught by the improvised basins was muddy with reddish earth . In a few hours much of the sediment would settle , and by morning the water would be pure and clear . Then all canteenscould be refilled to last for two more days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us ? We still have a few hours of daylight . " Yes . And so . And well . Before moving ahead from here it was only wise to search the great flanks of the mesa to see if anybody was in hiding there . That would take a long time , and must be done , for secrecy and surprise , by one man . Night would come before the search could be ended . It would proceed better after dark , even , than before . So . And this . " Why ? " Because so . This way . If there is a man in the rocks , with a horse , there will be small sounds which are better heard at night . Not seeing , the searcher will listen the more acutely . " But what if he gets away during the night while we are all asleep ? " That . So this . After the rain , the tracks of anybody moving out of the mesa in any direction would show for weeks . He could be followed almost at anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least expected it he would be overtaken . It was then decided . The detachment would stay overnight on platformsof talus under the overhanging walls of Bear Mesa . The sol/diers were glad to know this . They asked if they might have a fire to make coffee and heat their beans . No . And no . And no  --  this was Joe Dummy 's opinion . Rosy light off the rocks would be a warning , if anybody was watching after dark for pursuers . There would be one pursuer . It would be Joe Dummy . He would set out to find his way alone to the top of the mesa . From the rim he would be able to see down into all the long folds of the rock . He could put his ear over the edge to listen . When he heard , and then saw , what he expected to find , he would bring Cranshaw back . He did so at half past five in the following morning . Leading Cranshaw'shorse , and marching Cranshaw ahead of him at carbine point , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the east . Matthew saw him first and motioned to him to halt below . " You men , " ordered Matthew to the others about him , " remain here . Private Cranshaw is a prisoner . He will be protected until I deliver him to the guardhouse at the fort . None of you will speak to him at any time for any purpose without my permission . You will all stay away from him , except the man I designate to lead his horse . " Matthew went down the rocky slope until he was face to face with Private Cranshaw and his captor . The young officer felt his heart pounding , and wondered at it . His exertions coming down the talus were not so violent that his heart must beat after them . What troubled him almost uncontrollably was anger , now that he confrontedthe thieving deserter of his command . He , the lieutenant , had been the victim of a betrayal like a betrayal in love . The excellenceof someone had been granted and trusted ; and it had turned false . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been shown to conceal corruption . A man for whom he was responsible , and thus a man for whose safety and well-being he would have fought and died if necessity had asked , was now known to be unworthyof such guardianship . Matthew looked at him . " Hello , sir , " said Cranshaw , tentatively , with his head turned a little away but with his clear , doubtful blue eyes on Matthew 's . Cran/shaw 's smile was as charming as ever . His brow was wrinkled with appealing perplexity . His mouth was fixed in a half-smile of hope . He had pulled off his hat and his curly pale brown hair fell in a boyish lock over his forehead . Every expression and attitude that he had always found successfully likable now showed in him as he stood a prisoner before his young commander . He looked as if he had already exempted himself from all blame , and was only happy to be back again with the squad . A chill settled about Matthew 's heart and brought him calm . If Cranshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew need waste no feeling over him . " Private Cranshaw , you will speak to me only when spoken to , " said Matthew , in accents which recalled the impersonal severity of his cadet life . " Turn about and walk around the side of that big boulder . Joe , keep him covered . " In a moment the three of them were out of sight of the squad higher up . Joe tethered Cranshaw 's mount . " Stand there facing me , Private Cranshaw , " said Matthew . To Joe he said , " Is that his carbine ? " " Yes , " said Cranshaw cheerfully . " You will address me as sir at all times . " " Yes , sir . " " Very well , " said Matthew . " I now officially inform you , Private Cranshaw , that you are a prisoner of the United States Army , charged with abandonment of your post while on sentry duty , desertion while in the field , and theft of supplies , rations and other government property . " Cranshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shone with sudden light . His cheeks seemed to be dragged downward showing the shape of bone . He licked his lips . He looked like a young man who had never heard of any such charges as were now made against him . But his habit of charm persisted , and he smiled deprecatinglyat the lieutenant . " You have nothing to smile about , Mr. Cranshaw , " said Matthew . " You will answer my questions . Your answers will go into my official report . " " Yes , sir . " Cranshaw was now serious . He had never before seen this impersonal stranger in Lieutenant Hazard . Much must have happened to change him so from the strict but friendly young officerp163of the second platoon . Matthew 's black eyes were hardened and their light seemed to come off steel points . " Why did you run away , Mr. Cranshaw ? " " I heard something and went after it . " " Sir . " " Sir . " " What did you hear ? " " Someone rustling around near the picket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " " I went to investigate and then I thought I should follow , sir . " " Why did n't you call me , or wake someone else ? " " I was n't sure , sir , yet , so I thought I would make sure . " " What did you do next ? " " I took my horse and saddle , sir . " " Then what . " " I went out where I thought I heard the disturbance and I walked after it , sir . " " What else did you take with you ? " " Nothing else , sir . " Matthew pointed to Cranshaw 's saddle on the tethered horse . Extra saddlebag and canteen were lashed there . " Oh , yes , sir , " said Cranshaw with a self-forgiving smile at his omission , " I did not know how long I would have to follow the Indian , and I thought I should have some rations along . " He risked a comradely smile in reference to the common lot . " A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What Indian ? " " Oh , why , the Indian I thought I heard out by the picket line . " " How did you know it was an Indian ? " " Why , I did n't think it could be anything else , sir , " said Cranshaw in an aggrieved voice . Matthew pierced him with a look . " Now let us see , Mr. Cranshaw , " he said . " You went out to investigatea noise which you were sure was made by an Indian , and before waking anyone you decided to be certain of what were after all merely suspicions . In order to make certain of these you saddled a horse and attached to it enough supplies to carry nine men three and a half days , or one man for almost a month . You were prepared to go quite a distance to make sure before waking me or someone else . Having made sure , Mr. Cranshaw , say at the end of ten days , were you prepared to turn around and inform me of what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are lying to me , Mr. Cranshaw . " " I left half of the rations behind , sir , " said Cranshaw , with an involuntary catch of breath that was like a dry sob . " I did n't take them all . " Matthew bit his jaws together at the desperate absurdity of this defensive statement . The confusion in Cranshaw 's statements exasperatedhim , and the cowardice which , he was certain , lay behind these made him contemptuous . Yet if cowardice was alien to Matthew'snature , he was driven to dig for its motive in Cranshaw . He felt that he must try to understand it , for his own satisfaction if nobody else 's , though what other good was now to be accomplished by such understanding he could not say . " When did you make your plans , Mr. Cranshaw ? " " Plans sir ?  --  I guess just at the time I thought I heard the Indian . " " When did you make your plans , Mr. Cranshaw , to steal our food , and crawl away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to mount and gallop ? These matters were not spontaneous . " Cranshaw gave him a pleading look . " But I told you , sir . . . " Matthew remained silent and simply posed his own presence . It spoke out with righteousness and physical power under control . All that he was stood against Cranshaw like a world lost to Cranshaw forever . Could anyone despise Cranshaw so wholly as the young officer seemed to ? Cranshaw could not believe this and yet he must . It cost him his imposture . The eager , thoughtless , impulsive youth vanished in Cranshaw ; and his place was taken by a weak self for whom he sorrowed . Tears came up to his eyes . His mouth trembled . The charm he had tried to invoke now inadvertently came to his being , and in his misery he gave Matthew for the first time a qualm of sympathy for him as a fellow being in mortal trouble . " The idea came to me , " he said , " as we rode down toward Mexico after we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matthew remembered Cranshaw 's obscurities of behavior . Bitterly he chided himself for not having taken them as grave warnings . " As you worked out your scheme , " asked Matthew , " did n't you give a thought to the men you were going to leave hungry and thirsty ? " " I did , yes , sir , I did , I did , but I could n't help it . I could n't forgetp165what I had seen . " Cranshaw was sobbing now in widely separated gasps . The sound hardened Matthew toward him further . " We had all seen it , Mr. Cranshaw . " " Yes , sir , I know , I know . But I kept thinking of what it would be like if something like that happened to me . " What leaped out in this was Cranshaw 's dearness to himself . It was so dear that Matthew had no reach of the imagination to grasp it . " We had a good chance to fight for our own safety , Mr. Cran-shaw . " " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how I  --  And then we got close to Mexico , and I thought of when we would go on into the Mexico mountains , and there they would be , and if one of us got killed , or taken , then it might be me , and I ca n't stand the idea of what they did to Sergeant Blickner , and if they did it to me , sir , I  --  " He choked to silence . Revealing with a gesture the memory that had driven him to his ruin , he cupped his big tawny hands over his groin . His shapely face was fixed in the ruefulness of a weeping child . He raised it forward toward his commander begging for comfort and reassurance . Matthew , unable to offer these , withdrew from the whole allusion of Cranshaw 's unspeakable concern . He took refuge in a calm resumption of his interrogation . " Where were you planning to go , Mr. Cranshaw , once you had escaped from the Army ? " Cranshaw shuddered himself away from thoughts and replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up a train for California , and find me a job there , probably up North somewhere , and take a new name , and start all over . I know I could make a success out there . " " If you were going to change your name , you knew you had done something wrong , then , Mr. Cranshaw ? " " Oh , yes , sir , I knew it was officially wrong . " " Officially ? " " Yes , sir , but I bet the other men would feel just as I did about it , if they had the chance . " " Many of us might feel afraid , Mr. Cranshaw . But not all of us would admit it by running away . " " No , sir . " Matthew was exasperated to the point of silence . He had never confronted a personality so elusive . Cranshaw , ostensibly healthy ,  |p166well  enough spoken , and certainly popular in his time at Fort Delivery , seemed unable to grasp the realities of his present situation . Further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of plan . It was now time for the lieutenant to make his next decision . He weighed the pertinent circumstances . " Joe , " he said , " we have recovered most of the rations stolen by this man . Do you think they would stretch far enough , if we took up the trail after the Indians again ? " " Oh , no , sir ! " exclaimed Cranshaw . His fright was plain . Matthew ignored him . And yes : some people could go on those rations for quite a while , and so : so , replied Joe . More important , he felt , was the fact that the Apaches now had gained an additional two days ' lead over the pursuing squad . But even that might be overcome , with much luck and skill . So . But who could promise , now ? There was , then , doubt about the outcome of resuming the chase , and therefore the wisdom of it . Matthew 's first decisions in the field were of great discomfort to him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet  --  so he hotly asked himself  --  would new opportunity be created if he were more daring ? Why had he to figure and weigh and compromise ? He knew well enough why  --  he was regarding the welfare of his men . But a great commander always seemed to behave as though no one but himself need be considered  --  hisown dash and brilliance could move whole armies , bestowingon them dash and brilliance until they moved as one man , in the likeness of the commander . All seemed simple and clear in Creasy , like the difference between day and night . But not so with Matthew . He found no clear mark between the black and the white of his condition now . Was this what command was  --  to wish he could be sure of being right , and to hope that others would think he was ? " We are returning to Fort Delivery , Mr. Cranshaw . " Cranshaw 's relief at this was sickly to see . Matthew continued , " Your horse will be led . You may ride with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . " Cranshaw was dumfounded at this . " You mean I will be treated as a prisoner , sir ? " " Yes , Mr. Cranshaw , for that is exactly what you are , and I told you so before . " " Oh , I did n't know it would be this way , I did n't know it , I did n't know it . "  | " Mr. Cranshaw , do you have any idea what the penalty for your offenses can be , even in peacetime ? " " I guess not , no , sir . " Matthew squinted earnestly at the soldier 's still watery eyes , and read there only a bewildered desire to be liked as he used to be . " Then I wo n't tell you , now , " said Matthew . It was as near to mercy as he could bring himself . He turned to Joe Dummy . " Joe , we 'll get to moving now . " To be given silence was Cranshaw 's worst punishment so far . If he spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye was upon the men . They looked at him and kept still . During the afternoon of their second day 's march to Fort Delivery , Cranshaw called out , " Listen to this , you fellows , " and began to sing : There are bonds of all sorts in this world of ours , Fetters of friendship and ties of flowers , And true-lovers ' knots , I ween . His voice was light and true , and into it he put all his powers of beguilement and appeal , such as had made him so popular in barracks . Giving now of his talents , he rose up in his heart . He presented his excellence to his comrades . How could they not receive it and ask for more ? The boy and the girl are bound by a kiss , But there 's never a bond of old friends like thisWe have drunk from the same canteen , The same canteen . He held the last syllable , letting it fall away sweetly . Then he looked about for all the faces of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the response they showed . " Hey , what 's the matter with you all ? " he asked in a lightly chidingtone . " Do n't you want to hear old Crannie sing for you any more ? " When there was no answer to this , Cranshaw laughed shortly and shrugged . His face whitened . His mouth dried up . He was amazed , and then fearful , and justly so.  |p168First  Lieutenant Mainwaring , listening in his headquarters office to the report of Second Lieutenant Hazard , maintained an air of noncommittalgravity . Matthew showed him on a wall map of Arizona Territory where the detachment had gone , and what , in each significantplace , it had done . When he was finished Matthew waited for comment . It was long in coming . Teddy gazed out the window and whistled a tune in a whisper . Across the parade was the guardhouse , at one end of the forge . In it reposed Private Cranshaw . He was seen only by the guard and the soldier who thrust his food through his briefly opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of presence upon the post than he had ever done in freedom . Nobody could glance toward the blacksmithy without thinking of the man behind the bars . He was the first prisoner to be lodged there since the present garrison had arrived . One of their number was shut away from them . Every man to one or another degree was able to think of himself in Cranshaw 's state . Many fought away the sympathy they felt , cursing the prisoner for his deeds . Others were more courageous , and spoke up for him , and risked censure for their charity . The acting commanding officer was the man most affected by the astonishing circumstance of having a thief and a deserter behind the guardhouse walls . He hated Cranshaw for presenting him with a heavy problem in discipline ; and yet in a secretly pleasurable way , he was glad to have an opportunity to show what he would be capable of as a post commander faced with stern necessity . They would see . He was equal to the hardest challenges . It would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kitty would believe him right . That was enough . He turned his wide , rounded face to Matthew , and in a mellow voice which was meant to convey the gentleness of a strong man performinghard duty , he said , " Mr. Hazard , please write down the substance of your report as you gave it to me verbally . " " Yes , sir . "  | " I feel obliged to make one or two remarks on your conduct of your command . " " Yes , sir . " " Had I been in command of the detachment , I would have issued orders other than yours at certain points . I would have returned here with the whole squad bringing the remains of Sergeant Blickner and the laundress . " " Sir , my orders were to recover the missing persons , and the horses they had taken . I did recover the remains , and then I set out to overtakeand recapture the horses , and if possible , the murderers . " " Circumstances in the field alter decisions . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in pursuit . With a larger force , even if Cranshaw would still have defected , I would have been able to continue the direct pursuit toward Mexico while detailing a smaller force to apprehend the deserter . In this way the primary purpose of the expedition would not have ended , as it did , in accomplishingnothing . " Matthew stood silent . Perhaps Mainwaring was right . Teddy took his silence for criticism . " You do not agree , sir ? " asked Teddy . " Sir , I may have been wrong , but I came to my conclusions after weighing all the circumstances . " " I do not indicate that you deliberately did wrong . I only questionyour judgment . " " Yes , sir . " Having presented his planned severity , Teddy grew more friendly . " Well , well , what 's done is done . We will do what we can , now , to take cognizance of enemy action in this neighborhood . There are going to be changes around here . I count on you to help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my disposition of the case of Private Cranshaw . I imagine you 'd be interested to know what that will be ? " " Yes , sir . " " In due time I shall forward a request to convene a general courtmartialto try Cranshaw , and I shall press for the death penalty . " Matthew was astounded , and showed his feeling . " Abandonment of sentry post , theft , and desertion in the field , " continued Teddy , " all the charges you yourself have filed against him . " " But sir , we are not in a state of war . The death penalty , as I understand it , applies only in wartime . "  | " State of war may be subject to interpretation , lieutenant . We must make an example of the man . " " Yes , sir , I agree . The discipline here is  --  " he halted . " You will see discipline , lieutenant . Give me a day or two . When word gets out of what I intend for Cranshaw , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beg your pardon if I presume , but I would hesitate to speak of a sentence  --  an execution by firing squad  --  before a trial is held , when the court-martial might not arrive at the penalty you recommend . If it did not do so , the effect would be to weaken the command for having failed in its announced purpose . " " Again we differ in a matter of judgment , Matthew , " said Teddy with an effect of largeness of nature . " I believe we 'll just leave this to the acting commanding officer . " " Yes , sir . " Teddy grew gently serious . " It was most affecting , " he said , and his voice took on a mealy richness , " when we held services for the sergeant and Annie . We buried them out there in the graveyard . Captain Gray read the prayers . The whole garrison sang my favorite hymn , Safe Across the Stormy Waters . ' It was beautiful .  --  And then , at the very end , this was remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we had never noticed that he was anywhere near  --  my greyhound set up a long , doleful cry , and he kept it up till the graves were halffilled . My wife broke down , and I nearly did . The only thing we lacked was Trumpeter Rainey to sound taps . But of course he was on the march with you . " The acting commanding officer stood up to terminate the interview . The propriety of the funeral services in the post cemetery had restoredhis comfort of temperament . He shook Matthew by a shoulder and said , " Do n't feel too bad about the little expedition , my boy . It was good experience for you . You 'll do better next time . "  | " From a man , " wrote Matthew to Laura a week later one evening  --  a mail bag was going out the next morning by wagon to Driscoll  --  " who has never , so far as I know , been more than fifty yards from this fort since he got here eight months ago , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have already had more real experience than he has so far as activity in the field against enemy raiders is concerned . " He paused . Would Laura think he was whining ? If she were here , he would be able to discuss the whole affair with her , and she would see in his eyes and hear in his speech how honestly objective he was trying to be . And yet his feelings smarted , and deep inside his thought flickered the idea put there by Mainwaring  --  the idea that perhaps he had not handled matters as well as possible in the five-day march . He resolved to confine himself to a simple report for Laura of the whole movement he had led , and of what had happened since his return . It was enough to make a full letter . Resuming his page after the chronicle of his expedition and Mr. Mainwaring 's critical remarks , Matthew wrote : My self-respect was somewhat restored by a call from Captain Gray at my quarters late the same day . He said the C.O. had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the doctor ) had stoutly commended my course of action . At this Mainwaring grew lofty and closed the discussion . I asked the doctor if he knew what M. is planning to do about Cranshaw . He said no . I told him . He could hardly believe his ears , and then he erupted into fury . He thought the plan to let the men know that the prisoner was facing general court-martial and prosecution under the death sentence was sure to be ruinous as far as the state of society here is concerned . Well , my dearest , he was right ; and because I thought the same way , so was I. Mr. Mainwaring sent for Sgt. Fry , acting commander of the first platoon , and told him to let it be known in the barrack that Pvt . Cranshaw would be held prisoner for general court-martial and that he , the acting cndg. offr. , would press for death sentence . He told the sergeant that an example had to be made , and that no penalty was too severe for a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , etc. , etc. , and if it was the last thing he did , hep172was going to see that the new C.O. when he arrived would find a garrison smartened up in every respect . Sgt. Fry was stunned , as he said later . He did go back to the barrack , and he did tell what he had heard . He knew , and so did Captain Gray , and so did I , what any group of soldiers would think on receiving such news of one of their number . The first thing they all said was that this was peacetime , and only in wartime would , or should , the death penalty be considered for desertion etc . It was what you could expect  --  but what did then occur was something none of us imagined might come . I was dining with the Grays when we heard odd noises coming across the parade . The captain went to see , and then in a cold , flat voice , called me . In the late twilight we could see a gathering of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the foot of the hq. steps they halted , and one of their number went up the steps and rapped on the door . It was Sergeant Fry , as I could tell by the outline of his figure  --  he always stood with his upper body slouched , and his legs sloped straight backward at a long angle . Soon the door opened and let light out on the porch and the mob  --  for this was a mob . " Mutiny , by George , " said the captain beside me . He nudged me forward and we went over to the side of hq. porch to see and hear better . Mainwaring said , " Well , Sergeant Fry , you have business with me ? " The sergeant saluted and held out a paper . " What is this ? " said Ted , and his voice trembled a little , and the sergeant said it was a petition , which he presented on behalf of almost the whole troop , who had signed it , and he had been the first to sign . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sergeant said if he would read it , he would see that it asked that Private Cranshaw might be disciplined or reprimanded but that he ought not to be given court-martial with recommended death sentence for what was a crime in time of war but only a military offense in time of peace . The doctor whispered to me that the devil of it was , the men were right . Teddy Mainwaring began to shake with outrage , and maybe a little fear mixed in . " Sergeant Fry , this is mutiny , and you are the ringleaderof it . I take it very ill to have action like this come to my attention . You are relieved of your assignment . " He turned around to find help , and saw me and the doctor . He called me over . He ordered me in front of the demonstrators to arrest Sergeant Fry and lodge him in the guardhouse , and to march the men back to barracks and to hold the troop at reveille formation the next morning until the commanding officer appeared . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No/body moved . It was a tight second or two , and then Sergeant Fry said , " All right , you men , you heard the lieutenant . Snap up to it , " and because he had endorsed my command , they obeyed . I was in the strange position of being thankful to the soldier I was arresting that he had acted to support my authority . I marched them all across the parade , and there at the barracks , I halted them and faced them toward me and spoke to them briefly . I told them that evidently we had a problem which concerned the whole post , and that the only way to handle it was to keep order , do their duty , withhold their judgment , and give things a chance to be worked out . I said I would arrest and confine any man I knew of who made any further mutinous gestures . But I said I would be as fair and friendly as I had ever been with all men who conducted themselves in the right way . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we ca n't let that happen to any one of our troopers , and added uncomplimentary remarks about the c.o. , but I stopped them , and said that was all , and dismissed them , and then personally took Sergeant Fry to the guardhouse , and locked him up . Cranshaw recognized my voice in the darkness , and came to ask me if it was true , the thing he had been told , that he was to be tried and sentenced to death . I could n't see him , but he put his hand on my arm , and he felt like an old man , clutching and letting go over and over , and his voice was dry and cut in two . I told him he was not tried and convicted yet , and that he had a long way to go before he was . It was all I could say . I left feeling sorry for him for the first time . And if I felt sorry for him , how could I be amazed or censorious if the troopers felt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he laughed when he saw my face . He hit me on the chest and said , " Hazard , I 'll bet the thing that bothers you the most about this is that you ca n't believe it can happen in the U.S. Army . " I do n't know how he knew . He went on and said that the sooner the better for me to learn that the army is like any other human institution  --  it contains all kinds and descriptions of men , capable of every error , just like men on the outside ; and that I must not lose my ideal of the army because of this . Well , to jump to reveille the following morning , Teddy appeared and said that he had acted with the proper speed and severity against the ringleader of last night 's petition , but that he had not read the names signed to it , as he did not want to know who did and who did not sign it . But he said that the innocent unfortunately had to suffer with the guilty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole troop . There was to be a formation after breakfast under the command of Lt. Hazard , who would lead the garrison in troop formation out to the brush on the desert , where the men would cutp174enough brush for each man to make himself a stiff broom . On marching back to the post , the troop would take their new brooms , and beginning at the east end , they would sweep the entire parade ground , every inch of it , until all loose dust was gathered at the west end . They would then shovel this dust into bushel baskets from the warehouse and carry it and dump it in the arroyo back of the north line . This task would be performed daily until further notice . He then ordered the troop dismissed . So for three days we carried out this senseless work . There is no bottom to the amount of dust we can raise by scraping long enough at the surface of this desert . I had many a private moment of wondering how long the men would continue to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it is out of respect for me . I can hardly think they would care anything about my feelings or success or failure as a commander . But I suppose habit is strong , and isolated as we are , men here must prefer to cling together even under bitter and distasteful conditions rather than risk the anarchy that must follow wholesale disobedience . Teddy asked me on the third day how the men were doing , and what I thought generally . I could not escape the impression that he might be asking me for some way out of the condition he had brought to the fort . I told him I thought the men had had enough of it  --  not of work , for it has been lack of work that prepared the way for bad feeling and judgment ; but they had had enough of useless work . Indeed , he wanted to know , and what would I consider useful work ? Luckily I had an answer , for I have long thought that the open corners of the post area represented real danger  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There , I said , the men should be put to work building revetments out of earthen mounds , or of adobes  --  bricks made of water and straw and earth . It would work them harder than ever , and there would be something to show for it . He looked out the window and whistled a silent little tune , and said he would think it over , and nodded me out . But later he sent for me and gave orders to do just what I had proposed . So , my dearest , for the last several days , and for as many ahead as I can see , we are improving our defenses with earthworks . Luckily I have my engineering books with me , and my copy of Hopkinson on Fortifications . Following drawings which I made in ink outline , and which Doctor Gray shaded with his water colors ( he paints in water color ) the troopers are erecting fine crescent-shaped revetments . We will have fire-steps , parapets , crenellations and extern trenches at each . It must be weeks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the interest with which these troopers come to their work everyp175day  --  not that they do not grumble , for they do , and make worse of the heat , which is bad enough , for they do ; but when you hear one man criticize another 's work , or make a suggestion for improvement , or keep track of how much was done on a given day , you know there is at least some pride in what they 're doing , for they can see that it is a useful thing to be doing . Meantime what of the prisoners ? Nobody moves faster than a man unsure of himself . Mainwaring has prepared a report of the case for higher authority and has sent it along with the prisoners under escort , to Department Hq. for a decision  --  just what to expect , nobody knows . Mainwaring has let it be known that he personally feels that mutiny is just as deserving of the death sentence as desertion , and that thereforeSgt . Fry is exactly in the same case as Pvt . Cranshaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are all uncertain , and uncertainty is the soldier 's worst disease . The rest of us only wish the new C. O. were already here to take up the matter . This , Laura my darling , is what life is momentarily like at Fort Delivery . I shall hope in my next to have happier things to report , and will close this , only thinking that anything that happens here , because it affects or concerns me , must be of interest to you ... . and from there , stirred by the sense of how he and Laura were locked together in heart and mind each for the other 's sake , he gave himself up to words of love . Beyond all this there was one matter about which Matthew did not write to Laura . One evening in the last week he was sitting on the threshold of his lopsided adobe doorway watching the darkness draw over the world from the east . He was tired , thinking of nothing , and at peace . He had refused invitations to supper and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with relish after working in the sun all day building fortifications . His sentiments were hardly clear at the edge of his mind , but they dealt generally with Laura and the future , and they filled him with vague desire which was like a blissful dream . He was a lonely and hardy young man lost in a reverie of love . It was a state of being which brought to a higher degree of expressionp176his natural attributes  --  his ruddy color , the intensity and depth of his eyes , a little ridge that shone in a moist line around the edges of his lips , the strong charge of his blood as it beat its slow , steady power through his pulse . Suddenly from the direction of the arroyo behind the north line sounded the hornlike baying of a hound . It was the Mainwarings ' greyhound . He barked in long , excited cadences . Something there disturbedthe dog . Matthew went to investigate . He found Kitty Mainwaringstanding at the edge of the arroyo , gazing below , wringing her hands above the deepening shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Matthew , coming up beside her . " Garibaldi has trapped something down there , I can not make it out  --  some small creature near those clods of earth . I am terrified it might be something that would harm him ! " Matthew scrambled down the bank and came up to the dog , which was dancing about in clamorous fury . Matthew tried to pull him away from a little heap of fallen clods , and as he did so , he saw a large white scorpion with its shelled tail quivering over its back . It was like some miniature survival from a prehistoric sea . It might have been more imagined than real , but Matthew thought he smelled an odd , musty , yet acid essence in the air , released by the defensive insect . He knew that its sting could be gravely troublesome to a man , and that it might prove fatal to a dog . He glanced about for other clods , found a couple , and hurled them down on the scorpion . They broke , making a dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found a rock which took both his hands to lift . The scorpion tunneled its way out of the loose earth over it and began to streak for the bank of the arroyo to find a hole . Matthew stoned it and broke it . The rock rolled away . Exuding its thick fluids of life , while its flexible horny scales slowly unfolded into inertness , the poisonous small creature died . Matthew kicked earth over it . The dog tried to scratch the earth away . " Back , sir ! " commanded Matthew , and then called up to Kitty on the bank above , " Call him , Mrs. Mainwaring ! " She called . The dog ignored her . " Oh , bring him by his collar , Mr. Hazard , " she cried . " I saw that creature . It might sting him even yet . " Matthew put his stone to make a grave over the scorpion , and then led Garibaldi up the steep wall until they were with Kitty.  | " Oh ! whatever would I have done without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew , and laughing faintly at her weakness . " I was out for a little walk with my beautiful beastie here , and before I knew it , he was down the bank and attacking that thing ! What eyes he has , to see it in the twilight .  --  Thank you , Matthew , " she added , and her voice was close and shaken . " You are most welcome , ma'am . " He glanced toward his house as if to take his way there , but Kitty made no move to walk homeward , and out of politeness he stayed . It was most curious : whenever he had seen her lately , she had seemed tense , about what he could not imagine . Some inner excitement made her voice shake a little , and sound a little higher and louder than usual . Everything , even the smallest thing that happened when he saw her seemed to mean more to her than to anyone else . A dog barking at a scorpion was hardly enough of an event to make her look so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " said Matthew , patting the tall greyhound on its narrow head . Garibaldi licked his hand and sat down like a heraldic supporter . " He likes you , " said Kitty . " He knows I like dogs . " " Oh , so do I. Do you like cats ? " " Oh , yes , cats are often very funny to watch . " " But you do n't love them  --  I can see that . I always say I like cats , but I love dogs . " Her voice was breathy . She looked at him and even in the falling evening he could see that her eyes shone with extra moisture . What in the world did she feel like weeping for , he wondered . He could not know , she said to herself expertly , having rehearsed a hundred times the feelings that made a turmoil in her mind and heart , he could not know the burdens she had to bear . Her pride lay in ribbons , as she privately described its condition . Her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid or foolish . She had been forced to conceal from Teddy her opinion of his recent official actions . It was humiliating to lie beside him at night and be forced to reassure him a dozen times about his wisdom and strength of character . When he asked her to find out for him what people were saying about him at Fort Delivery , she wanted to scream at him and refuse . But she agreed . The laundresses would presently tell her , if she approached the matter delicately enough . And to think that she was facing , soon , what must amount to anp178eviction , when the Prescotts would arrive to take over Quarters I -- this was painful , and intruded between more pleasant thoughts at any time of day or night . Worst of all was the trouble that beset her about Lieutenant Matthew Hazard . Her mind flooded hotly with different views in succession as she dwelled in thought upon him . He went his way , doing his work , thinking of his Laura Greenleaf , gaining the good respect of the men which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she knew , Matthew never gave her a thought . But at what he aroused in her she suffered hours of discontent and wonder . What kind of woman was she , after all ? Was she no better than those commonguttersnipes among whom she had worked years ago in New York ? If being a lady and preserving virtue went together , then was she no lady ? She had allowed herself to be betrayed before her marriage . Must this haunt her all her life ? She could remember the feelingsof that time . They were brought alive in her again , now , by this quiet and dedicated young man beside her in the dusk . It was cruel that he must bring " that " out in her all over again . Perhaps the only way she could quiet it and transcend it was to bring it out in him , too . But when she showed him feeling which , coming from any pretty woman , any man would receive with interest , he simply did not recognize it . Her will was denied . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , and when denied , it worked the harder to prevail . Laura Greenleaf ! A fiery thread of feeling went through her . She could make him forget Laura Greenleaf ! But how could she live in the same row of officers ' quarters with him if , should she declare herself , he would not respond with his love ? He showed no sign of knowing what it was  --  the only thing  --  that she longed for , even as she told herself that she had no right to long for it . His love  --  but he seemed not even interested in her in any way . She turned abruptly away from him and saw the first stars given light by the darkening east . She was flooded with a choking tenderness , a feeling which seemed to resolve all her troubled interfacings of willful thoughts . She felt lovely and calm when she heard herself say , " Matthew , are n't you lonely ? " With a smile in his voice he answered , " I certainly am , Mrs. Mainwaring. "  |p179She  faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , why wo n't you call me Kitty ! Lonely , lonely , I am dying of it , and yet here we are , the two of us . I think we are waiting for each other ! " Having said it at last , she was suddenly sick with fear . He was so amazed at what she meant , which at last he recognized , that he took a little step backward . His action was involuntary . It told her all  --  the worst  --  she had to know . " Oh , no , Matthew , " she said quickly , " I can not imagine what made me say a thing like that ! You must forget it . I am such a goose , I always have strong sympathies , and I suppose I felt too strongly how lonely you must be , thinking of your Miss Greenleaf so far away . " He was not deceived , but he was grateful for her desperate work of pride . He moved to help her in it . " Well , Kitty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed so plainly in me . I am thankful for your concern . Under other circumstances , it might make me forget myself . " " You would think of me in that way , Matthew ? " " Who knows ? " She leaned to stroke the dog beside her . When she spoke her voice was sad and full of courage for those to whom she could give it . " I think it is best to admit how you feel . I can help you to overcomeit . We all live very close to each other here , and also very far away from wholesome distractions . We must all put forth a little extra effort in keeping our promises to those we love .  --  We really should be going back . Thank you for rescuing us  --  " she laughed and patted Garibaldi . " I 'll walk you home , Kitty , " he said . " But no gallantries , " she said . " You must promise . " " I promise , " he said , accepting the character she put upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They walked up the north line escorted by Garibaldi . Of the three , only the dog was not playing a part . Conversation of any sort was desirable . Kitty said , " I can not help wondering what they will be like . " " Who ? " " The Prescotts.  --  Have you heard ? Teddy has had notice that they will be arriving at Driscoll next week . We are to send an ambulance and an escort for them . "  | " No . I did not know . Doctor Gray has never met them , but he knows of them , and what he knows he likes . " " I shall see for myself , " said Kitty . " I imagine he will be very commandery-officery , and she will be very ranking-lady . Poor old Fort Deliver-Me ! " Matthew had a qualm of pity for her restless fears which had to be prepared against long in advance . They walked on to headquarters where new occupants would soon live . Hiram Hyde Prescott was born in Batavia , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , of Ezra Mulligan Prescott and Martha ( Baynes ) Prescott . He was much younger than his brothers and sisters . His mother survived his birth by only a few months . Until the age of twelve he was reared by his sisters . His father , a farmer , was a God-fearing man of reluctant expressionwho hoped his sons would succeed him as proprietors of his farm . In this hope the father was disappointed , though no one knew the depths of his regret when his two older sons left him to work as boatmen on the Erie Canal . To help him with the farm he hired a middle-aged man who drifted into the farm one day asking for work . The stranger was a veteran of the Jackson campaign against the Britishon the lower Mississippi . One of his duties was to teach young Hiram Hyde what he could about farming , soldiering and hunting . The boy was silent by disposition and lonely by habit . He had little active friendship with his father , who seemed too old to understand him and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to read , and read aloud to him in the evenings . Their family literature consisted of the Bible , the novels of Walter Scott , Fenimore Cooper , and Charles Dickens , and the tales and histories of Washington Irving . It was years before the boy realized that the books read to him were not historically and exactly true . When he learned this , he seemed to lose interest in books and reading and listening . Perhaps it was that his time of life was ready to bring him a livelier interest in the actual world ; perhaps he felt dimly be/trayed by the discovery that everything people told each other was not factual . In any case , he fastened his interest increasingly on Luke , the hired man , who took him hunting in the low wooded hills near Batavia , and along the little creeks that came through meadows , misty in morning and evening , and pure and clear by noonlight and moonlight . He developed a passion for hunting . Game  --  birds and small animals  --  aboundedin the intimate and lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to him full of open secrets , known to him alone . He became an excellent shot and he learned the craft of the trapper . Like his father , he was taciturn ; but this did not mean that he had no life in his thoughts . Always in terms of the actual , as he had experienced it , he came to many conclusions and convictions , which he shared with nobody . His sisters knew him for an intelligent boy , but they could not penetrate or alleviate his loneliness . They discovered that he had a smoldering temper , but almost never did he permitit to show itself in impulsive anger . It was years before he learned to blow up when he was angry or out of sorts . Luke took him to Buffalo one time on a canal boat on which one of the older Prescott brothers worked . It was supposed to be a great adventure  --  to go to Buffalo , the city of twenty thousand people , and see the sights . Hiram was interested enough , but nothing could persuade him ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . The United States was a real place to him , a place he loved , but its image was not cities , with their broad , muddy streets , their noise and confusion and costly pleasures , their sense of hurry and strife . His nation was , in his mind , an enlargement of the land around Batavia  --  woods , meadows , little wild valleys , the blue drifts of autumnair in the distance , scarlet maples , the pure mounding snow on wintry hills with ranks of bare trees marching like armies with fixed bayonets over their crests , and the stirring hum of spring in the woods and fields , and the drenching drowsiness of full summer when his thoughts droned sweetly through him like bees heavy with honey . In his youth he thought less about citizens , people , men and women , as those who shared his nation with him , and more about the adroit foxes , weasels , partridges , pheasants , doves and owls whom he knew so well . When he hunted and shot them , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his victims.  |p182These  elements were the basis of his patriotism until at the age of twelve he added another , which brought into his life the power of an ideal . In 1852 his father and sisters decided that he was needful of more education than they could give him at the farm . Accordingly he was sent to live with his mother 's brother in Albany , a schoolmaster called Joseph Baynes . One of Hiram 's first lessons out of his new books dealt with the life of General George Washington . He learned what General Washington had fought for  --  the independence and internal order , the self-respecting freedom of the American states . It was a large subject , and the thing that brought it within Hiram 's grasp with the power of an ideal was this  --  that in his youth , George Washington , like Hiram in his boyhood , had been a forest man , a hunter , a trapper , a walker of the wilderness . In the greater scale of Washington'syears as a wilderness surveyor Hiram saw all the things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batavia , which on going to Albany he had left never to return . Washington 's life completed his concept of the United States , and confirmed his love for his country . He would never have been able to explain it , or write it all down . He was a slow but thorough student , and he took pleasure in reading the newspapers with all their reports through the years of the trouble that was building up about slavery , the Western territories , and such large matters . In the mid-1850 's there was already talk by extremists of possible war between the Northern and Southern states over the abolition of slavery , and the balance of power with respect to the matter in the Congress . Hiram had no notion of war other than that absorbed from the maundering tales told by Luke back on the farm . These dated from 1815 , which was almost like prehistoric time to Hiram . At six he had heard sweeping rumors and odd reports from the war with Mexico far away on the Rio Grande and beyond , but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various victories , and the impression he received one day when some neighbor women came with news to tell his sisters . While his sisters listened and consoled , the other women wept into their fringed shawls over the death in Mexico of a husband , a son  --  someone they loved who had been killed in battle or who had died of disease . If war ever happened , Hiram knew he would be a soldier , but not a leader . He matured early physically , which induced other boys to turn to him for leadership . But he never felt he knew enough to tell othersp183what to do . He preferred to be among them and for the most part did not see the need for anyone to tell anyone else what to do . He was popular because he was strong , stocky and honest , and because he had such a fine hand and a good head for handling horses . He used to ride in the race meets down the Hudson as a youth , and in time his opinion was sought when a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He knew their natures for what they were , and while working to make them better through training , he never impatiently required of them more than they could perform . In time he came to apply this gift to dealing with people . He learned to do it in a hard school . In 1861 the war between the states actually did break out in consequence of the Republican victory and the election of Abraham Lincoln , who ran on an anti-secession platform . Hiram was one of the first young men in Albany to enlist in response to the President 's call for troops . Commissions were being arranged for their young men by influential citizens , and Professor Baynes was in a position to obtain a lieutenancy for Hiram . But Hiram refused . He refused , too , the position as lieutenant of cavalry when his volunteer troop elected him to the rank . Again he felt that he did not deserve to take charge of others . His regiment was shipped by steam cars to a camp in Pennsylvania , where he spent months waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ready to march . Drill , firing , guard duty , training horses took up his days until his regiment was called south to the defense of Washington . It was a life he slowly came to like in spite of its crowds , its lack of privacy , its uncertainties about the future . Hiram was a man who saw the world in concrete terms . In the Army he found man , vastly multiplied , and fixed in the least abstract of situations and circumstances . He found himself increasingly at home amidst his fellows ; and the time came , even , when he thought he could do something for them better than they could do for themselves . It was the beginning of him as an officer . His promotion came to him on the battlefield.  |p184He  was in the column moving south into Virginia under Sheridan when his platoon was separated from the command by traffic confusionin a supply train at a crossroads . Hiram 's lieutenant led the way on a detour by a field . In the field the platoon was ambushed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hiram 's officer was killed and several other men were killed or wounded . Out of sheer demoralization the whole platoon was ready to be captured until Hiram rallied them with violent exertions of body and language . He brought them back to the main road fairly intact and reported to his captain . Word of his performance was carried on up the line until he was summoned by General Sheridan , who confirmed his assumedlieutenancy with official promotion . It was the best possible dedication to the Army for Hiram Prescott . Circumstances had forced him to put himself forward . In doing so he proved himself capable of command , and thus were quieted many self-doubts that would have plagued him if he 'd been given command before events revealed him to himself . He now knew that he was capable of meeting challenges which lay within the frame of action . Other challenges , residing in powers of mind and imagination , he hoped he would never meet . He served through the first Virginia campaign earning promotion until he was brevet captain in command of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profane when angered . In battle he was oddly quiet . He then seemed wholly self-forgetful , and all his faculties were given over to seeing clearly what was happening in the fight , so he might better be able to move his men wisely and protect them as he sought to damage the enemy . In his rare opportunities for recreation and indulgence while quartered in towns , he found much the same kind of fugitive assuagement through women as the rest of his men , with no confusions of romance , but yet with a certain gentleness and gratitude which told as much about other men at war as it did about him . For if with hundreds of thousands of men he was engaged in the business of willful killing of other men , he could not help bearing invisibly the marks of such action . More than many men , he felt the hurts and deaths of the soldiers of his daily association . That death and wounds came to men often through his orders he accepted without guilt ; but not without fellow feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing the gestures ofp185destruction he  --  and other soldiers  --  performed through assuagement of desire the gestures of creation . He was wounded one blue and gold morning in autumn on the edge of a creek in a Virginia woods . When the momentum of battle passed beyond him he was left to die . But he did not die , and a day and half later he was found , brought to a field hospital , and then evacuated to Washington on a halting steam train that carried with it its own swarms of flies . Hiram Prescottwas mostly unaware of the journey . He was lost in fever , dreams , alternating drifts of peacefulness and pain . " Captain ! Captain ! Look out ! Look out ! " he heard someone cry over and over again , but when he looked to see who warned him , there was no one there , and he said to himself , passing his hand across his face , " I am confused , " and then he saw again that vast and rapid dark bulk in the air above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the blue sky , and he threw up his arm against it , but to no avail , for out of it , that dark riding fury like a cloud , came a strike like lightning , and he knew at the time that it was not lightning , but the blade of a cavalry saber , which flashed directly toward him , until he felt it enter his breast and leave him fallen upon the rusty oak leaves of that creekside in Virginia where his blood ran over little white pebbles to join the clear water rippling its way in the crisp sunshine of that early winter day . " Captain ! Captain ! " cried the voice again , and he tried to rise toward it , though he could not see who called to him . But why should anyone call , now , at all , for was he not already wounded and lying there alone by that creek , which flowed into the Rappahannock ? Would he die without being known about by anyone , ever again ? " Captain ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and met resistance , and awoke . To awaken so was a great shock . Who would hold him like this ? And that cry  --  he knew now that it was his own voice which called " Captain , captain . " " Hush , captain , " said someone.  |p186He  looked wildly . His head bobbed like a puppet 's . His breath was hot and strident . He was running with sweat . He had died , in dream , of his wound . " Lie down , captain . You had a nightmare . It is all right now . I will bathe your face . " Weakened by pity , he went back to the pillow and licked his lips , which tasted to him like the rim of a tin army mess kit . The dream receded , but slowly . It spoke out from him once more , even though he was now fully conscious and remembering fact . " I was wounded by a Rebel horseman , " he said in a gasping whisper . " I had already been wounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rode right over me , and if his horse had n't taken a jump over me , the horse would have killed me too . " Leaning over him to bathe his forehead , Jessica Dryden smiled and said softly , " You were not killed by anybody , Captain Prescott . Do hush now and rest . We must not disturb any of the others . They are trying to sleep . I believe your fever has broken at last . " He stared at her . There was light on one side of her face only . It dwelled on her smile and it made a golden spark for a second deep in her eye . He glanced aside . He was in a long wide-high-ceilinged room with lofty windows . Heavy shadows draped all he could see . He believed that rows of beds reached all down the room from where he was . Here and there a tall screen stood about a cot and made shadows like up-ended boxes standing together . A few lamps were burning low . Far outside in the hall through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened him because it was so infinitely far away and so still . He turned to her . " What is this ? " he whispered . " This is the Armory Square Hospital . " He was determined to sound intelligent , though it cost him a pain in his head . " Where is it ? " he asked . " In Washington . " " Who are you ? " " Miss Dryden . " " But how did I get here ? " She was quietly withdrawing her attentions from his needs , hoping to bring him gradually to sleep.  | " A hospital train brought you to Washington . You were assigned to my ward . You have been here a week . " " A week ! " He shut his eyes in disgust . A week and nobody had told him about it ! She watched him . His eyes remained shut . In a moment he slept . It was deep , easy sleep , and she gave her folded towel a little pat of satisfaction , as if to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned the coal-oil lamp a trifle so that its improvised mask , made of a brown manila government envelope , would cast its pale golden glow on the foot rather than the head of the cot , and leave the captain in quiet shade yet not in such total darkness that he would be fearful on awakening . She had seen enough in her months of service as a hospital volunteer to know how the strongest men when lost in dangerous illness could reveal if never confess the fears and even the hopes of childhood . It was time for her to go home . The night orderly had come to his place at the duty desk in the hallway . She had had a full day , and she had stayed longer than usual because she had heard the surgeon say that he suspected that they would know , one way or the other , about Captain Prescott , before another day came around . She was glad to have stayed , for she had seen the captain in his suffering for that whole week , and when before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war to peace , awakening in safety from the fevered dreams which had held him in torture for that whole week , she could not repress a feeling of triumph in her breast . To see the look on his face change from blind anguish to ineffable relief  --  this was a moment she believed she could never forget , no matter how accustomed she might be to the woes of the hospital , where one day was like another , and one man seemed like another , and time itself had little momentary meaning . Jessica sighed deeply and left the ward to go home . The atmosphereof the place went with her always , in her plans for the next day , and her feeling for the patients . She was one of the volunteer helpers who came to work with the Army 's professional nurses and doctors . The hospital was understaffedand crowded . The food was abominable . Proper sanitation was almost wholly missing . The place stank and the very air seemed hopeless of the restoration of health to the rows and rows of sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services the volunteers  --  Jessica herself  --  became expert in meeting and even anticipating the wants of the patients . They would read them theirp188mail and take letters by dictation to be sent home to families and sweethearts . They learned what little dishes of food might taste good to the men in their assigned sections , and these they would bring in late afternoon , when the patients were most likely to be feverish and disconsolate . They would bring if they could find them little articles which the sick and wounded asked for  --  caprices of their former interests . Most of the volunteer workers were women . Some of them were young , and of these a number came from what Washington regarded as its first families . Miss Jessica Dryden was one such young woman . She thought much about the meager information on the card which hung at the foot of the captain 's cot . She tried to make it tell her more than it could about him . Prescott , Hiram Hyde , Capt . Cay. b . Batavia , New York , 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Eliza P. , Batavia , N.Y.She translated these impersonal items . He was twenty-three  --  so young to be a captain ; he must be a famous soldier . If she read correctly , he was unmarried . His parents were dead , and in case of necessity , his sister was to be informed . Batavia , New York , must be a small community . Prescott was a fine-sounding name . Did they live in a great square board house with tall shuttered windows , and a glass lookout , and a wide lawn , set in a grove of dark hickory and sycamore trees ? To look at him , unshaven for so many days , and so ill , she thought he might be anything up to forty years old , and a poor farmer . But why on earth did she think of all this ? She laughed at herself , as her mother had taught her to do years ago in her willful childhood . The oldest child and only daughter of United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Lycurgus Tewkes Dryden and Isabel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1843 . Twin brothers followed her into the family three years later . The Dryden residence stood in the row of plaster houses on the same side of Lafayette Square as the private house of Presidentp189Madison on the corner , where Mrs. Dolley Madison was still living when Jessica was born . The White House was within sight in its often muddy park at right angles to these houses . One of Jessica 's earliest memories was this : to an iron balcony fronting the street she would be carried by her mother for a look at the park in the square . Her mother was a tall , slender woman with much grace about her . She held her young daughter up to wave to friends who went past in varnished , open carriages when the days were fine . It was a pretty spectacle  --  the high-stepping horses , the coachmen and footmen on their boxes , the ladies with parasols in summer or muffs in winter , the gentlemen in glossy top hats of the best Western beaver , the twinkling of polished carriage spokes . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own pleasure , even when , as often happened , the President of the United States and Mrs. Polk drove by and waved to Mrs. Dryden , who waved back . So did Jessica , comfortable in her child 's order of the world . No matter what visited her later in life , Jessica seemed able to retain a sense of serene comfort which could sustain even deep personalsuffering with a sort of spiritual good manners . This gift was composed of a number of elements . One was her religion , for which she had a feeling so true that it was almost without thought . Others were a sense of high position calmly recognized , and natural good health , and an innately aristocratic knack for assuming that matters of inconvenience should be dismissed . Finally , her sense of flowing harmony in life came from the presence , never spoken of but daily revealed , of a really rich happiness between the father and the mother , the Justice and his wife . It was an enfolding and reassuring atmospherein which to grow up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it their own life-long sense of safety , contentment and justification . Mr. Justice Dryden was at first glance a formidable man , tall , heavy , richly whiskered , big-voiced , and given to disconcerting fits of scowling when he was thinking most actively . Jessica was much like him in a certain abruptness of manner and strike of thought , though these traits were transmuted by her modicum of her mother 's charm and grace . Judge Dryden , like so many men of his vocation , was inclined to grant opinions in domestic matters rather in the manner of decisions handed down from the bench . As she grew old enough to know what a Supreme Court justice was ,  |p190and  the law , and to differentiate between the manners of people as they talked , Jessica dared to tease her father for his heavy ways . This might have been perilous but for his devotion to her , which was almost inordinate . He had married late in life , she was his first-born , she resembled her mother whom he adored with secretly abject gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart , and in general Jessica could do nothing that he would not suffer , even when if she was in error he brought his grandest legal battery to train upon her in judgment . Mrs. Dryden came of an interesting family . Her father had been Secretary of War  --  the Honorable James Hamilton Mercer . His name was a modification of the French name Mercier which took plant in the United States just after the nation 's victory in the Revolutionary War . In the command of Admiral Rochambeau with the French warshipswhich fought for our independence was a young naval officer of the line , named Vicomte Etienne de Mercier . After the War he resolved to settle in the United States of America , went ashore , bought a farm in New Jersey , doffed his uniform and title , and became a philosophical agriculturist . In a world so new , a political atmosphere so without precedent , Citizen Mercier 's views , innocent and passionate , seemed appropriate . Actually they were a naive mixture of Rousseau , Locke and Pascal , but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manor house or planting a garden or even engaging local farmers to make things grow and to harvest them when ripe . The ex-vicomte founded a family , died early , leaving a heritage of debts and social confusions , and a penchant for public affairs which drew his son into running for Congress . In the course of the campaign for his seat , the name Mercier , in deference to the speech habits of the American voter of the time , was modified to Mercer . This congressman served several terms and then received cabinet appointment as Secretary of War . His duties in this position took him to the West for personal observations , and while he was not one of the first or greatest of surveyors or pioneers , he was one of the most orderly , with a strong sense of posterity , and his name was commemorated by a number of geographical names beyond the Appalachians . His wife Honora was equal socially to his official responsibilities , and the drawing room of Mrs. Secretary Mercer on the second andp191fourth Tuesdays was always attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercer , a daughter of the house , grew up amidst the glisten of candles and prisms , and later , gaslight , and the rich hum of talk muffled by velvet draperies and thick Turkey carpets , and a sense of government as embodied in people  --  the very people who carried it on . She married Mr. Justice Dryden right off a sofa in her mother 's drawing room , as she herself once put it . The justice had been coming to the Tuesdays for years . Nobody knew it but Isabel herself , even as a child ; he came not to see famous men or listen to Mrs. Mercer 's rattling talk but to see Isabel grow from child to woman  --  the woman he adored in secret and never hoped to win . Isabel helped him to make his secret plain to her almost against his will . He proposed and was accepted . Though not without difficulties raised by her parents in duty , affection and perplexity . The Secretary was shocked at the wide difference in age between his daughter and her fiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glancing in her mind 's eye across the company she commanded  --  judges , diplomats , persons of undefinedbut weighty authority , clever clerks and of course people of rank in the Army and Navy  --  she saw no one with quite the distinctionof Mr. Justice Dryden , and she approved the match . As a child , Jessica loved to hear from her mother , Isabel Mercer Dryden , the story of this marriage and the obstacles that had beset it , and as in any familiar and beloved story when the same triumphantoutcome came true each time she heard it , she clapped her hands at the bravery of the lovers and the defeat of the wicked parents who would thwart them . When she was about ten years old she ceased looking like a brother of her twin brothers and began to look like a miniature woman . Her garments were thick , bulky , overwarm reproductions of the clothes her mother wore , with tight uppers , overlapped sleeves , several layers of wide woolen skirts on taped hoops , and coarse black stockings and high leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a point of light . When she went out of doors to walk or to ride in the family carriage she wore a heavyp192shawl folded into a triangle , and a bonnet with a spray of pheasant feathers . So much clothing  --  in color dark , ranging with various costumes through brown , green , gray , violet , crimson and black  --  concealed the tender and troubling swellings of adolescence which came to her early . She began to take a longing and passionate interestin how she looked , begging in prayer that she might be exactly like her mother , who was the prettiest woman she knew , and also the most amusing , and also the most dependable . The Drydens were Catholics . Mrs. Dryden came by her faith through its descent upon her from her ancestor , the emancipated Vicomte de Mercier , who for all his fashionable skepticisms , had never left the Church . The fact that Mr. Justice Dryden was also a Catholic had much to do with the success of his suit for young Isabel 's hand . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mr. Justice Dryden , like Mr. Chief Justice Taney , served both his faith and his judicial duty with impartial gravity . As a child Jessica Dryden knew God as someone to whom she could whisper secrets , certain that they would be heard and safely kept . As she grew older , her prayers remained impassive ; private meditations in which she could come to the realization of life 's varied experience , to meet which she would need strength . She could ask for this , quite aware that what she asked might not , out of a wisdom larger than her own , be granted . But the asking , and the certainty of being understood , gave her a power of belief in the general worthiness of mankind which grew in her with all the troubles she ever encountered  --  her own , or those of other people known to her . Her habit of faith was like the breath she drew . She could not imagine living without either . It would have to be a calamity or an aberration which would rob her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a schoolgirl she could shudder in genuine concern for those who for whatever reason had lost the shelter of God 's arm and were alone and cold outside it . In her twelfth year , Jessica was sent as a day student to a fashionableschool for girls in Washington . She there discovered , through the solicitous remarks of her realistic schoolmates , that she was not pretty , and probably never would be  --  pretty in the conventional , and therefore desirable , style . It was a severe blow , for she had always felt  --  and been made to feel  --  that she was pretty . It was the spirit of the family which had given her this happiness in her condition of early life.  |p193Her  response to the discovery was characteristic . After a few days of secret misery , and many queries in prayer , she thought she would do well to discover if what those other girls said was true or not . If it was not , she need pay no attention then or thereafter to anything else they might say . If , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must determine what could be done about it . It did not take her long to agree that what they said was true . She was more plain than pretty , though her expression was attractive  --  surely it must be attractive , she urged in her prayers , since she felt so warmly toward everyone and all of life . She began , then , consciously to make up for the deficiencies in herself which she thought apparent to the world . By this course she achieved what few people do  --  she deliberately created her own character . Her criteria were both simple and worthy . One of her precepts was to be busy . In her school she became the most influential young lady , until the habit of command was well lodged in her . Her studies embraced a list of conventional subjects : English , history , French , penmanship , geography , music , cotillion dancing , embroidery , manners , watercolorpainting , decoration of china , elocution , dramatics and the Bible . The students were expected to learn at home such crafts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style in entertaining , elementary gardening , croquet , diabolo and , in prescribedapparel , the riding and driving of horses . Jessica showed proficiency in all such formal and informal matters of learning . She brought something of her own to all this systematic preparation for life  --  something which those who lacked it tried anywayto imitate . It was a decisiveness , an ability to make up her mind , and to give reasons for doing so . In an age when it was considered becoming for a maiden to show diffidence and helplessness , Jessica 's crispness of thought , her clarity of view , and her often lightly given but never lightly meant conclusions were noticeable . Her mother once said to her , " Sit down and listen to me , my pet . " Jessica sat down and folded her hands in her lap . " Yes , Mama . " " You are very good at the things you do , are n't you ? " said Isabel Dryden . " I mean to be , Mama . "  | " Yes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning to be , and actually being so ? " " I never thought of it , Mama . Everybody else tries to do their best . Why must n't I ? " Isabel put her hands on her daughter 's and smiled with love into the clear young face , and answered , " You should , my darling . But when you succeed so often in what you set out to do , it gives you  --  it would give anyone  --  a sense of being always right , and therefore somewhat better , than anyone else , not only in the thing done , but in all things . I speak of this only because I would hate to see you in spite of yourself become a willfulfemale . " It was said so fondly that Jessica instead of being hurt began to laugh . " Mama ! Do you mean to call me a shrew ? " Isabel , with some relief and a surge of love for the good sense of her child , said , " No , I mean something worse  --  I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everybody . " Jessica thought this over for a moment , and then she hugged her mother , and admitted that perhaps she had been in danger of taking charge of everyone . Again with her clear-headedness she assessed her nature and worked to govern this aspect of it . Deliberately she withdrew from certain eminent positions which had fallen to her in school  --  she was to act and sing the leading role of Egeria in the opera of that name by Bowiton , and she was to provide the charades for a Saint Valentine 's Day party , and she was the newly elected chairman of the Martineau Forensics Society ( Miss Harriet Martineau had recentlylectured before the student body with telling effect ) . All these , with other conspicuous honors , Jessica gave up , meeting protests with assurances that she was abandoning nothing and no one , but would take part to the fullest like everyone else ; but she would just not direct everything . Her modesty and unabated enthusiasm combinedto win her even greater success than before . As legends could , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in repetition acquired a solidity which gave substance to her in the grown-up society of the capital . Justice Dryden 's daughter Jessica , even before she was presented to Washington society , was a personage.  |p195Following  a supper party given by President Buchanan and his sister in the White House for the Drydens and their closest friends , Jessica made her debut at a reception across the square in her own house . It was a famous party . Jessica was , for the moment , spoken of as the catch of the season  --  of many seasons . She had gone beyond needing to look pretty . At eighteen she was handsome . Her color was high . She held herselfbeautifully . Her brow was wide and open , and her eyes were brilliant in their blue-gray color , under dark brows . Her cheekbones were rather prominent and when she smiled or held a hazy smile they seemed to rise a trifle more . The night of her party she wore a complicated , many-layered and repeatedly draped gown of white satin . Her hair was dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dressed low on her neck . Above her brow was a wreath of small pink rosebuds made of thin velvet , and more of these little flowers were set in garlands upon her immensely wide , shining skirts . Her bosom was daringly exposed . It was the first time she had worn a low-necked dress . She was conscious of it all evening , and to deny this to herself , she resisted strong impulses to hold her fan in concealment or lay her hand above her heart . She felt that she was dear to look upon that evening , and if she had not been , this would have made her so . But , " Nonsense ! " she said to herself . Her thoughts , her joys were so full as to be almost unseemly . They brought intimations of maturity . She longed to be a woman . Her twin brothers were allowed to attend her party wearing their first evening coats . She looked , she seemed to them , like someone entirely new , a stranger , playing the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of escapes in which someone inevitablywas left behind ? In her happiness something smote her with a pang . She took her brothers ' faces in turn between her white-gloved palms and kissed each boy tenderly while her eyes filled with tears and she smiled and frowned in the uncertainty which created her hunger and also fed it . If this was an important moment , it was also brief , for she turnedp196back to her duty , which was to receive her guests and make them easy . The period which followed in her life seemed to others  --  though she never gave any sign to encourage the opinion  --  like an anticlimax . She had many suitors but none quickened her heart . They came at prescribed hours to call , set their shiny silk hats  --  beaver hats had gone out  --  or army kepis or navy caps on the hall table which was covered with a Persian rug , and came into the drawing room to make a case for themselves . This was always done in the presence of Jessica and her chaperone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , or occasionally a cousin who was a nun stationed in a Washington convent . Young men from the foreign embassies came , too , and Washington was sure at various times that Justice Dryden 's daughter could have become a lady of title on a number of occasions . Such opportunities seemed to be lost on her . She kept her popularity , in an enjoyable life , but she seemed to reach a motionless state . She was certain that she must not marry for position or amenity alone . She must wait until she should fall in love . When she did not , she knew she must make herself busy . She wondered if she might not obtain a position as a teacher in some  --  perhaps her own  --  school for young ladies . The issue was discussed at length in the Dryden household . Justice Dryden was weightily against any daughter of his undertakingemployment unless she needed to earn wages , which was manifestly not the case . Mrs. Dryden had no such qualms . She had come from a family heavied by debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to money  --  its value , desirability or power . What she minded was the thought that her delightful Jessica might through the life of a teacher imperceptibly pass into the condition of old maid . She knew Jessica was too truly in need of a woman 's creative life to be content , however strongly propriety might press , with the lot of the spinster . The difficulty was politely and considerately held in abeyance by the family , but everyone knew that sooner or later Jessica must take a stand . She insisted that she must have something to do . She hated idle women . They seemed to her wasteful in the worst way . She lovedp197and respected her father and mother , but their view of her life would not forever be hers . What would bring her her own ? Like so many other conditions and circumstances of a private sort , this one was changed if not immediately resolved by the trouble that came to the nation as a whole in 1861 when the Civil War began . Personal concerns seemed to subside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of every citizen . The Dryden twin brothers went into the Army . Washington was threatened by the Confederate forces . The justice aged visibly at the tragedy which overwhelmed the nation of which he was an idealistic and severe servant . When the wounded began to arrive from the South filling the hospitals , established or improvised , Jessica Dryden at last had " something to do . " She went to work as a volunteer visitor at the Armory Square Hospital . Her whole self was consumed with interest , compassion and inguenity on behalf of her assigned patients , whom she believed she regarded with enlightened impersonality . This was true , but only until after several days of high fever and coma , during which he seemed to be living in dreams of desperate battle , Captain Hiram Hyde Prescott returned to consciousness and saw her , learned her name , and looked forward to her next visit . When she returned to Armory Square the next afternoon she went in the usual order down the row of her assigned patients . She kept herself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely the other men were precisely as important to her as he was . It was over an hour before she came to him . Then she put her hands to her cheeks and laughed in astonishment . " Well ? " he said , weakly , but with a smile . He had been shaved . His mustache was still rich and full , but it was trimmed , and his cheeks and chin were clear . He was pale , but for spots of color over his cheekbones . His eyes were brown , as she now saw for the first time . " You are better ! " she cried.  | " I am almost well . " But this was nonsense and they both knew it . He looked at her in such frank wonder and curiosity that she raised her head and dismissed the effect of interest in him . In a simply dutiful tone she said , " Captain , is there any particular thing you would like for me to bring you , if I can find it ? " He was too weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shaved by an orderly . He preferred now to look and enjoy the sight of her . She was rather tall , very slim , and held herself almost like a soldier . Her hair was a dark gold , and her eyes were clear gray . They were deeply set and her cheekbones rose against them when she smiled . There was something tawny in her looks ; she was not beautiful in an ordinary way , but if she reminded him of anything unlikely , it was of the way a young lioness looked , though you had to add human charm and individuality to such a comparison before it could be right . Her voice had a cool sound to it . She was the most composed young woman he had ever seen . Her question remainedunanswered . He scowled to recall it . " If I think of anything , I will ask , " he said . His voice was shallow and husky with weakness , but he tried to give it resonance , and she noticed this . It touched her . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds contained so many poor histories , so much unspoken fear , so much flickering hope . It troubled her still to breathe the fetid exhalations of sick breath in the air . But she angrily told herself that she had to be here only six hours a day : what about those men who were trapped here day and night in their infirmity ? She knew enough about the night-time hours when pale , wide rings of light from half a dozen oil lamps revealed themselves on the dingy white ceiling and threw long black shadows everywhere else , and the narrow windows let in glimpses of sky and perhaps now and then of a star . In the corner of the ward stood a rank of folding screens made of shirred muslin held by wooden frames . They waited to be unfolded around a cot where death might come . Jessica never caught then in her glance without feeling an impact at her breast . Captain Prescott followed her glance and said , " I guess all of us in here think about those , and wonder if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said with humorous asperity . " They wo n't tell me what my chances are . I think they do n't know . "  | " The surgeon tells me you are progressing , now . " " Did you ask him ? " " Of course . " He looked at her like a tired child , full of wonder at something he could not understand , but which gave him a sense of well-being and peace . He closed his eyes to keep the feeling ; and thinking he was going to sleep , she was about to tiptoe away when he looked at her again and said , " What is your name ? " " Miss Dryden . I told you . " " Who are you ? " She opened her hands in a gesture meant to say , " I am what you see . " It did not suffice . " No , " he insisted , " where do you live ? " " Here in Washington . " " Are you a nurse ? " " Not actually , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is your father ? " She went a trifle taller at his insistence , but then she shrugged and thought that if he wanted to know so much , and was so direct about it , she might as well humor him , which would tire him less than a snub . " My father is Associate Supreme Court Justice Dryden . " " Lycurgus Tewkes Dryden ? " " He . " " I once thought of going into the law . " " But you did n't ? " " No . I went into the Army when this war came along . " She thought of him . He was like so many thousands  --  so many hundreds of thousands  --  of young men whose aims in life had been turned away by the shots fired on Fort Sumter two years ago . With a breath , she made herself come to duty , for if she stayed to talk , she would tire him . " Have you not yet thought of what I could bring ? " she asked . " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted you to ask me again . " " Now captain : why ? " " It would show you were interested . " " Interested ? I am interested in helping everyone who  --  " But shep200was sorry at once , for his deep brown eyes were flooded with pain . In his condition , all feelings and reactions were exaggerated , and could not be hidden . She added , " But , since you have never before asked me for anything , I wondered , of course , more about you than I did about the others this morning . " " You did ? " His eagerness was so transparent that it made her smile . " Yes , I did . Now what is it you want ? " " Well , the thing I missed most of all during my army days "  --  he spoke as if they were over forever  --  " was the daily New York Tribune . So if you could find me a copy now and then , I would like very much to see it . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I like to read him , if only to disagree . " " But how can you read it , if you are not sitting up just yet ? " He smiled at her with some power of beguilement far beyond his strength to sustain , and said , " If I can not , perhaps you will read the paper to me . " Jessica lifted her chin . It was time to look superb and administer a snub . She said , " Newspapers are frightfully scarce in wartime here in Washington , but I 'll see what I can find , " and left him . At home that evening she said to Justice Dryden , " Papa , what do you do with your New York Tribune every day when you have done with it ? " The justice slowly wagged his great head toward her and glared . If she reminded someone of a handsome lioness , her father would be the old king lion himself . " Why ? " he asked accusingly . Isabel Dryden , his wife , sighed comically at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father always challenging and resentful of the daughter 's separate life , the daughter always trying the farthest limit she dared in order to escape him , and yet keeping between them the family 's strongest bond . Mrs. Dryden never worried about what might happen in the event of her own death ; but if one of those two ever lost the other . . . she sighed again . But she also smiled , for she was warm in heart and lively in spirit , and refused at her age to start willing others to be what they were not . " Answer your father , " she said to Jessica . " One of my wounded officers at Armory Square , " said Jessica , " wants to see the paper . I am looking for copies to bring him . "  |p201The  justice at once felt in himself a division between compassionateduty and jealous love . His wife saw this plainly in his face . She knew which impulse he would obey . The visible model of duty , he yet yielded to jealousy . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must obtain copies elsewhere , " he said . " Mine I find useful in official ways . The back numbers are filed in my office by Miss Cleary . They often contain matters of legal interest . " " Yes , Papa , " said Jessica , and laughed at him for scowling at her with such painful inquisitiveness . She knew what worried him . She knew too how little reason there was for his present concern . It was a nuisance , but she would have to go back to Armory Square the next day with empty hands . As soon as she arrived at the hospital in the following afternoon she found something else to give her more concern . Captain Prescott was gone . Another man , bandaged across the eyes and emaciated to the bone , lay in his place , motionless and silent . Or was this he ? She felt something tumble deep in her breast . If it was he , what could have happened to him ? She tiptoed to the foot of the cot to read the name on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned . Where was he ? He must not have died  --  this she could not think of . She went to the corridor where at his littered table the day orderly was leafing through his muchthumbedrecord sheets . " Where is Captain Prescott ? " she asked . The orderly  --  he was a weary , unkempt and ill-spoken young man  --  replied , " Who is Captain Prescott ? " She told him he should know , and described the location of CaptainPrescott 's cot . The orderly frowned at being bothered with so little a matter as some sick man 's identity and scratched about at his papers . " This one , " he said , indicating a large black X on a diagram of the cots in the ward , " is Prescott . " Her heart sank . The X lookedp202like an erasure of a whole being . " I moved him . You 'll find him in the far corner underneath the stovepipe . " She was so relieved that she neither reproved him for his bad manners nor thanked him for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found Captain Prescott . He was trying to lean up on his elbows and watching her come toward him . She had not yet changed into her working smock . Just above her eyes she wore a small round black hat with a feather . Her wide-hooped dress was of dark-green broadcloth with a long coat to match , both braided in black silk . She carried a sealskin muff to which violets were pinned . The captain all but called out to guide her as she came . " What are you doing here ! " she demanded , while at the same instance he exclaimed , " I was afraid you would never find me ! " They both laughed and she asked , " Do you like this new location ? " " No  --  no . It is dark and has no air . " " Why were you moved ? " " I do n't know . " " I shall see about this , " she declared , and returned to the duty desk in the hall . There she asked that Captain Prescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The orderly stared at her in slack-mouthed amazement . What possible difference could it make where anybody was put ? he seemed to ask . " Well ? " asked Jessica with her eyes blazing , and power exuding from her whole attitude . She was her father 's daughter . The orderly did not reply . Instead , he rose and walked into the ward . She followed him until they stood beside the captain . " You making complaints ? " asked the orderly , looking down at the captain . There was menace in his tone . It brought a surge of vitality to Prescott , who replied , " I said I preferred the other place to this corner . If that is a complaint , I am complaining . You will address me as sir . " " You think you 're the only sick man around here ?  --  sir , " added the orderly with heavy sarcasm . Jessica intervened . She saw the danger of further antagonizing the orderly . In her absence Captain Prescott , without defenders , might be really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tall windows she saw a clear space on the floor . " Orderly , " she said , with charm , for she was also her mother 's daughter , " why could n't you give orders for the captain to be movedp203over there by that window ? I am sure he would be grateful , and so would I , for then I could find him more easily in my work . " The orderly enjoyed her idea that he might give orders . Out of self-respect he was obliged to raise an objection , but in the end , taken by the way of this young lady who made herself up to him , he agreed , though with a certain gloomy relish all his own . " The man who was over there , by the window , he died last night . I was just fixing to set a new man there . But being ' s you ask for it , Miss Jessica , the captain here might just ' s well have it till he dies . " Jessica blazed out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet call , affirming for anyone to hear what the caller believed and wanted . The orderly shrugged . Jessica blushed deeply and dared not look at Captain Prescott , who lay grinning with pleasure over his champion . Jessica pointed to two soldiers who were mopping the aisle between cots . The orderly summoned them and under his orders they carried Captain Prescott , cot and all , to the open space near the central window on the far side of the ward . " Now I 'll have to change my diagram , " said the orderly in a mixture of importance and resentment , and moved away . Jessica glanced after him . " Poor wretched creature , " she said . " You see what dealing with so much suffering does to some people . " " Nonsense , " said the captain fondly , " you are too charitable . He 's just a lout . " " I could not bring the Tribune , " she said , " but I 'll keep looking for it . " " Yes . " She thought it best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit her other charges . When it was time for her to go home , he was sleeping . She tiptoed past his place , and she thought how touching it was , and  --  how odd , that when someone slept he seemed as far away as possible from everyone else , and yet in a strange , even a sweet way , in certain cases , he was most intimately present.  |p204Going  home that evening , she took with her an impression which had a strange energy in her mind . Why , out of all the dozens or hundreds of wounded soldiers whom she had attended for over a year , should he take possession of her interest ? He was not remarkable to look at . She had met and excused herselffrom the company of dozens of better-looking , more impressive young men . It could not be that her sensitivity of the sad conditions of the hospital made her pity him until she thought about him more than she wanted to  --  after all , there were other young men suffering the same conditions and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best for them and had passed on from their places in the rows of cots . Why did it seem so significant that she had fought for him ? To think of it : she had made herself up to that miserable orderly , she had flattered him with her expression , and she had prevailed . She had openly taken up the cause of Captain Prescott and now , in consequence , and uncomfortably , he had become a part of her . At dinner that evening she felt cross and tired , rather as though she were coming down with something  --  a cold or Tyler 's grippe . She was abstracted and silent , quite unlike herself . Her mother said , " Your work at the hospital is plainly tiring to you , my pet . You must go to bed early . " She kissed her father and mother and went upstairs with a heavy heart . A family silence attended her until she had turned the last stair landing going up ; then the voices of her parents , though not their words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door closed . " She does take it so conscientiously , " said Mrs. Dryden . " I do n't like it and I never have , as you know , " said the justice . " She merely does what ever so many other girls are doing , Judge . I admire her spirit . " " I make no comment upon her spirit . It is quite something else , and I believe you know what I allude to . " Mrs. Dryden left her work and her chair and went and put her hands on his cheeks.  | " I know , " she said , " all those men . But my dear , do n't fret yourself so . Men are everywhere . If Jessie were interested in anyone , we would be the first to know . " " No ! " cried the justice . " She would not be afraid to tell you ; but me ? I would be the last . " " She loves you . She could not bear to hurt you , knowing how you feel . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in his breast , and his wife stroked his great mane of shining gray hair , and saw , as only she was privileged to see , the vulnerable weak man inside the formidable person of the jurist . Jessica sat in the dark , looking out of her window through the bare branches of trees . A few gas street lamps were burning . She could see across the square to the portico of the White House where a dim glow showed through the fanlight . She heard carriages and horses go breaking the frozen ruts of the muddy streets . She could not put Captain Prescott out of her head . He had seized her imagination . She saw his bright color and his calm , deep dark eyes that looked at her from a world of experience which because it was his she wanted to know in every detail . He was still weak , but his voice had a curious burry richness to it . Something about the way he made the words he spoke  --  some cleanness of their formation by his teeth , tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said and what he meant . Nobody else spoke just that way . When had she ever before notice or remembered how someone spoke the common speech ? Amidst all the squalid mercies of the hospital  --  " might just ' s well have it till he dies "  --  he seemed curiously detached , as though immune to the foul odors , disheartening histories and poor futures that filled the long , whitewashed ward where an acrid scent of lime-and-water mingled with all else in the air . He had a spreading mustache , and if this made him look older , his eyes made him look younger  --  no , made him look ageless . She was angry at her heaviness of heart , for she must believe that he saw her only as another volunteer female worker just like all the others , and no more meaningful for him than all the others who passed down the wards when nurses and orderlies were busy elsewhere . All her good sense told her to stop being a fool . He should mean no more to her than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Tribune ? If he was starved for the editorials of that tedious old Mr. Greeley ,  |p206she  would go to any lengths to provide them . She thought of somehowintercepting Mr. Justice Dryden 's copies and spiriting them away to the Armory Square Hospital , all the while maintaining innocence at home as to their whereabouts . When had all this started ? Shaking her head , she reviewed the helpless course of developments . For a whole week while he had lain unconscious and near death she had come day after day to watch by him . Would she ever know the color of his eyes ? The grain of his personality ? She knew his voice , but only in its anguish , for she heard him cry out wordlessly , and then one day she saw him struggle to rise and she held him against himself and heard him call in fevered urgency , " Captain ! Captain ! Look out ! Look out ! " And then with the speed and force of a blow , his delirium gave way to consciousness , however weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry peace when he realized that he was awake and safe . That must have been the moment , she said to herself , of the beginning . She was in love . How would she ever manage matters ? For nobody must know it , not her mother , certainly not her father , least of all Captain Prescott , whom she must go to see again tomorrow , and again , however difficult this might be . She had no sleep that night . What she did not know was that he did not sleep either , and for the same reason . But his feelings instead of bringing him sorrow brought him a restorative kind of happiness . He lay awake most of the night looking at the long shadows cast by the low-turned coal-oil lamps in the ward , and he felt a promise of strength flow lightly into him . It was a balm for his wounds and a pledge for his future . His heart turned around for pity of the fellows lying all about him . What did they have to cling to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would come back every day or two for a long time . His chest wound was the slow kind , they said . He would n't be out of there for weeks . With wisdom beyond speaking , and with memory rising out of the uncounted generations from which he had come to be , he was absolutelycertain that given enough opportunity to see her , and normal progress in his recovery , he would make her come to him for life . The next day just as Jessica was preparing to go to the hospital , her father 's Negro coachman returned to the house with a bundle which he was to deliver to her . " Mr. Justice Dryden 's compliments , Miss Jessica , " he said pullingp207off his rosetted top hat and handing her a roll of newspapers . She saw at once what they were  --  the most recent issues of the New York Tribune . She wanted to laugh and cry . The extremity of her feelings showed her again how her emotion had gone out of proportion to its prospects . How like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh traits , and then , relenting , to reveal indirectly his kindness , which arose from his desire to please her . Her excitement was great at now being able to gratify Captain Prescott . In it , she all too soon forgot the little sacrifice of her father , and the grudging self-governmentit stood for . For days , then , she read aloud from the New York Tribune , while Captain Prescott watched her rather more than heard her . The newspapercopies , she explained , were obtained only in " frightful difficulty " by the " most breathless exertions " ( Jessica spoke the language of her sister debutantes ) . He nodded gladly . She thanked heaven that she had to read aloud . It permitted her to be impersonal . The opened pages of the newspaper were her refuge in his presence . But not forever . One day she found the captain feverish and flat on his back . " It is nothing , " he said , in a husky weak tone . The surgeon had been in and had found a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast wound . Said he 'd been looking for it to happen , as so often seemed to happen from bayonet and saber cuts . Cautioned him to be quiet , and promised to be back in two days for another look . " Two days ! " she exclaimed angrily . The news threw her into a panic which she could not entirely conceal . " Do n't you think you need a special nurse ? " she asked . He laughed thinly and answered , " Where in Washington is there such a thing ? " Desperation took her . She turned pink , and gave a likeness of distraught beauty which in his new weakness made his eyes fill , and she said , " Well , then , if there is no other way , I would come and remain onp208duty , and nurse you .  --  We can not tolerate the inefficiency around here ! " Her remark about inefficiency was meant to save her from sounding too personal ; but her words were like a confession . The captain gazed at her , smiling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the stinging in his eyes . He knew what he knew even if she might not . But he believed she knew too , now , and calling her for the first time by her first name , he reached out and took her hand and drew her down to sit beside him on the edge of his narrow cot . She made to take away her hand , but he would not let it go , and rolling his head on his hot pillow , he grappled for her gaze with his , until she turned to look into his eyes , and then her own eyes filled with tears . " Why will you cry ? " he asked in a whisper . " I do not want you to grow worse , with infection and fever , but to get well . " " Why do you want me to get well ? " " I want all of my patients to get well . " At that , he whispered a clouded laugh , and knew that she was evading the truth which was so dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clever in pressing his advantage , but only acting with the genius of the moment , he said that he loved her , and that he had loved her from the very first day when he had awakened to see her there , and had begun to feel better . To Jessica this was almost enough to make her faint , for through these weeks she had lost herself more deeply every day in what she was certain was an unseemly and hopeless infatuation . Now Hiram lifted her hand slowly to his lips . He asked her his question with his eyes , now himself unable to say anything , and , mute and trembling , she nodded her head . In one moment she was delivered from her shaming anguish into the reward of her life . She stayed with him till long after the usual visiting hours . She held his hand as he fell asleep . The tall window faced east beyond his cot , and as the night deepened in it from top to bottom , the evening star came out and hung faithful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immeasurable distance . The pulsations of its light were like the words of a prayer . Jessica said a prayer.  |p209She  found herself praying often in the next days that her will might be done without hurting anyone . By this she referred in her heart to her father . Her marriage ? If anyone was to be in charge of that , and determine whom she must marry , and when , it was powerfully understood in the family that it must be her father . He would be prudent , for her sake , and weigh all factors , and require heavy promises of the future before he would consent to release her . She begged Hiram to give her his secret promise , and wait until the War was over , and then they would be able to make their own plans more sensibly . " Wait ! " he exclaimed . " I am going to marry you as soon as I am discharged from the sick list ! " He had no doubt that he would recover wholly from his wounds . He would return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to come home to when the War is all done . " " Yes , oh , yes , " she said ; all he said was wonderful , but just the same , they must look at the world , the real world , through which they would have to realize their desires . It was not a promising view . Captain Prescott had neither a fortune nor even a position of employment to which he might return after the War . He would like to live on his family farm at Batavia , New York , but this belonged to his two elder sisters who resided there as maiden ladies . Further , he could not see Jessica there for the rest of his life , unless he had a lot of money to bring it back from its rundown condition , and he had no money . He supposed he might return to Albany , where he had gone to school , and there establish a polite riding academy . Perhaps  --  an excellent amateur rider himself  --  he might breed race horses for private owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , I will manage something when the time comes . " She embraced him and shut her eyes against the obstacles that faced them , and her heart against the judgments that she knew would be made against him , and said , " You will , you will , I know you will . " If he was confident about his share of the future , she must be equally so , or pretend to be , about her share . The immediate form for her confidence to take was to bring Hiram together with herp210family under conditions which must not , at first , suggest anything more than kindliness to a convalescing soldier . When he was well enough to venture forth on little expeditions , she walked with him . Their first promenade took them to the foot of Sixth Street to see the wharf where military supplies were docked . It was a busy place . Hiram was absorbed in watching this phase of the Army 's work . He fell into a few words now and then with soldiers on the job , and Jessica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living a child 's life under the care of women . He was a man of authority , full of powers that dealt with the hard materials of the working world . Was it possible ? He loved the Army . On another walk they saw a regiment in the streets , just arrived by troop train from the north . The soldiers were halted and they lounged in ranks . Hiram 's eyes kindled when he saw them . The company formations stretched as far up the street as they could see . Hiram exclaimed , " By jimmy ! That 's a fine bunch of troops . I could make somethingof these boys . I 'd make them know before they got into it what they were going to face . They do n't know now . Look at the little biddy fellow there  --  the yellow-haired one . I could keep him from scaring off . I could make a soldier out of him . " When they saw army wagons in other streets , he stopped and watched them if they moved or inspected them if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartered in the Capitol and drilled on the Capitol grounds , and soldiers slept in improvised bunks in the Patent Office Building . When he could , Hiram would ask men in uniform how the War went , and partake of their experience as they told it . " Do you want to go back ? " she asked . " I do and I do n't . You understand . The more of us that work at it , the sooner it 'll all be done with . " She saw that it was the only work in his life of which he had had long and deep experience . He must have been a boy when he went to war . He was a man and an officer now and he was at home in the frame of the Army . One Sunday they walked through the square in front of the White House . She pointed to a house on the corner across the way . " That is Dolley Madison 's house . I saw her just before she died when I was a tiny girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your mother ? "  | " No . Our house is next door . I was playing on that iron balcony there on the second story . " " You live there ? " He stared . " Yes . We are going to call there , as you put it , one day soon . " He was abashed at the grandeur of her place in Washingtonliving across the square from the White House . He flushed darkly . " I suppose you 've been in the White House ? " he said . " I have . As a matter of fact , Mr. Buchanan gave me my comingoutparty there . He appointed my father to the Court , you see . " " Do you know the Lincoln ? " " I have met them . Him , I mean . He spoke to me . She did not . " " Well , " he said , tightening her arm under his as they walked , " some day we 'll go to the White House together , because of who Iam , at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let anything happen to make him ever feel less confident and strong than he does now , no matter what happens ! Even in her love , she knew that men could fail , and she pledged herself to him in her heart , whatever might come his way in life . On the following Sunday afternoon after Jessica 's carefully prepared occasion , he came to call at her father 's house . Lycurgus Dryden and his wife , Isabel , received him courteously . Dealing with an unknown man , their sense of caste was quieted by their patriotism , and here was a wounded officer to whom it was their duty to be kind . Mrs. Dryden felt no exaggerated qualms offhandabout the acquaintance between her daughter and Captain Prescott . It was the justice who , behind all his terrific front of judicial austerity , knew at once that from his point of view his daughter was in peril . His fatherly attunement to Jessica was acute , and he felt but concealed an immediate alarm . They sat in the front parlor and consumed hot chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without assistance from the justice , who sat massively silent in his great tufted armchair and gazed above their heads at the view through the looped lace curtains that hung before Lafayette Square . Mrs. Dryden did her best.  | " My daughter has told us so much about you . How remarkable for you to make such a remarkable recovery ! " " I am lucky , ma'am . " " He 's brave , " said Jessica . " I 'm lucky to have had the kind of care I received . " " Yes , we are proud of our girls who work in the hospitals . It is such heartbreaking work , at times . . . . Do you expect to return to duty , captain ? " " Yes , the surgeon thinks he will discharge me as fit pretty soon . " " Ah . Well . I do n't know what to wish for you . When my sons are out of the fighting  --  no , I would have to wish that they go back and fight if they wanted to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet . Captain ? May I give you some more chocolate ? " He declined with thanks , and said he must be going . The justice rose and bowed gravely but said nothing . Mrs. Dryden shook hands and begged him to come back any time , until his orders should take him away from town . Jessica saw him to the door . After he had gone , she watched him walking with his slight limp , and knew where in the family her trouble lay . It was more serious than she had even thought it would be , and it forced her to an imperative solution . She knew what she would do , if necessary , if the time should come . The fact that she resolved upon her course without hesitating was proof of the strongest of all the bonds between her and Hiram . This was his complete absence of doubt about his power over her , and the gentleness of the way he used it . In fact , it was more true to say that he never used it at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . He never had to use it because Jessica acknowledged , in her every attitude , humor and response , that it was a welcome power . A day or so later Mrs. Dryden said to Jessica , " Would you like to invite your little captain for a meal ? " " Oh , Mama . You know what Papa would be like . I can not expose anybody to that .  --  I do n't want to make Papa unhappy . " " Has he reason to be unhappy about this , my pet ? " " Yes , Mama . " Jessica went to her mother and put her face on her breast . " Yes , " said Mrs. Dryden , " I thought it might be so on the captain'spart . But not really on yours . Has he asked you ? " " Yes . "  | " What did you say ? " " I want to marry him . " " Is he a Catholic ? " " No . " " I thought not . " " How could you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . But who is he , darling ? " " He is the dearest in the world , whom I love . " " Yes , yes , of course , of course , " said Mrs. Dryden in almost a nursery singsong of fondness and memory , " but you know what your father will have to know . " " Oh , Mama , how can we do this without hurting anybody ? " Isabel pressed her child to her heart . " God knows . Is n't it dreadful ?  --  You do know , my pet , nothing should even be thought about it until he talks with your father . " " I know . " " Waiting wo n't make it any better . Ask him to call on Sunday . Quite without thinking of you , I do n't think I can stand uncertainty any longer than that . " If Jessica longed for her mother to embrace her with a rush of happiness mixed with compunction for the stages of life that must come to her when wed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful for her mother 's grim determination to have the issue faced without delay . On the next Sunday , while Jessica prayed for a miracle , Mr. Justice Dryden received Captain Prescott for the purpose now tacitly admittedin the family . In his library at the rear of his house , the justice said with impassive courtesy , " Sit here , captain . Join me in a cigar . You have something about which you wish to speak to me . " Hiram could never remember afterward just what he had said , but somehow he managed to state his proposal . The justice left it unanswered while he asked a number of questions in a dispassionate tone . " Your health , sir : is there promise of your complete recovery from your wound ? " " Yes , sir , so I am told by the surgeon . " " Your wound : has it in any way threatened your capacity to sire a family ? " " No , sir . "  |p214The  justice was enacting the gestures of his professional style . His great head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy brows . As on the bench , he looked neither stern nor indulgent , but only grave . His collars and cuffs , starched stiff , dazzled Hiram . His black satin neckcloth was rumpled in careless magnificence . His right hand , holding a lighted cigar , would have trembled but for the fact that his other hand held it steady . After a pause he asked his next question in his deep , growling , liquid voice . " What are your personal financial resources ? " Hiram let go a long breath and confessed that only an inheritance , at an unpredictable time , of part of a New York State farm might be his . " Then , " said the justice , " no doubt you have employment in the civilian world , or a business , to which you will return on being mustered out ? " " No , sir . But I am confident that I will make my way in business . " " All young men are confident . But not all are successful . You havenever received training for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . But I am young , and I once thought of law , too  --  " Justice Dryden dropped his gaze to his growing cigar ash . It was arestrained but skeptical gesture . Before raising his expressionless gazeagain he asked , " What do you know ? In general : what ? " Hiram felt like a schoolboy whose mind empties when directly examined . It was therefore with nothing of the heroic in his tone as he replied , " Well , I reckon , nothing but war , sir . Battle . Working to get men to do what they 're told . I guess that 's pretty much of life . And death . I know death , for I 've seen enough of it . And then , duty . I know that too . And I suppose that 's all I know , sir . " The modesty of this , and the size of the matters it spoke of , from the mouth of a man so young , who had known only these matters between boyhood and its end , endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . What a son this captain would have made . Moving to recover himself , the justice said , " In what business do you seriously think you might make your way , as you put it ? " " I had considered opening a riding stable and horse-training establishmentin Albany . I am a cavalryman . " Now the justice looked at Hiram fully . By dropping his folded andp215draped eyelids the merest fraction he gave a greater impression of outraged sensibility than he could have given full voice . " My daughter ? " he said quietly . " You propose to make her a livery-stablekeeper 's wife ? She who keeps her own carriage and pair , though now for wartime economy they are laid up ? Sir . " Frightened and offended , Hiram showed spirit , though in another instant he feared it must cost him dearly . " Whatever work I am going to do , I shall do honorably and withoutundue pride , Mr. Justice . " This brought a deep flare of light to the old man 's eye for a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of his mind since the beginning of the interview . " Captain Prescott , do you read the New York Tribune ? " The captain brightened , for he was sure that in saying yes to this he was about to gain the justice 's respect as a well-informed , alert citizen . " Oh , yes , sir . Even in the hospital every day I can get it . " Mr. Justice Dryden felt a hot lick of fatality about his heart . So this was the man . Jessica had been taking him the New York Tribune for nearly two months now . His first instinct had been right . The affair was serious . It had lasted many weeks . The young people no doubt were certain of having their way . " What is your religion , captain ? " " Why , I do not belong to a congregation , but I consider myself a Christian . " The father had his duty , no matter what else it might be called , and he would do it . He stood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find unsatisfactory your replies to my inquiries . Your prospects are not those to which I may with justice commit my daughter . " Hiram also rose to his feet . Eagerly he detected a scrap of hope for the future . He must have Jessica , even if it should mean waiting . " When I leave the Army , sir , " he said , " and when I have shown what I can do , then , sir , may I speak to you again ? " " Thank you , sir , for your recognition of my stewardship in the matter . But I consider any further communication between you and Miss Dryden to be ill-advised , and I must ask you with all courtesy to desist from paying her further attentions , now or at any future time . " Nobody could look into the justice 's heart and see there the fearp216that came to him with the idea of losing Jessica , his only child , his image , his other nature . The father 's position resulted in what he most hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discharge from the hospital . With it he received also orders to return to his regiment . He had five days ' grace before he must leave Washington . That evening Jessica said she would read aloud to her father and mother . The justice selected one of his favorite passages from The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , by Edward Gibbon . He lay back in his grand chair and smoked and listened in deep contentment . His wife worked away with her needle and thread . Her thoughts flew faster than her fingers , but she must never speak them , even to herself , or she must say them aloud to her husband , and this , for her child 's sake , she could not do . Moreover , what if she were wrong in what she was thinking ? Nobody had ever given her exclusive right to the truth . But she sighed . Jessica read slowly and clearly . Now and then her father would call for her to repeat a sentence  --  one which he particularly enjoyed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruptions of the empire . When had man ever had a daughter so obedient and so gifted ? Jessica gave her father great happiness that evening . When it was time to go to bed , she kissed him . If he had looked at her , he would have seen her eyes filled with unaccustomed feeling . He hugged her and let her go . She had never loved him more than then , saying good-by to him without his knowing it . Jessica 's greatest advantage in these hours was the certainty in her family that she would of course do nothing for which her father had not granted permission . They were not in the habit of thinking that she would do anything against their wishes . In the freedom of movementwhich she enjoyed under this blind assumption , she had her way . On the next day , with a prayer at her heart that she would be forgiven by heaven and earth for what she must do , Jessica Dryden eloped with Captain Prescott . It was what she had always intended to do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , her friends and her Church.  |p217They  went before a justice of the peace who kept an office in a shack on the Port Tobacco Road and were married in a ceremony which lasted less than a minute , and which shamed her . She recited the Hail Mary all through it . Hiram felt her trembling and knew she was shaken by something in addition to the squalid formalities of the occasion . She must repose herself wholly in him . He would quiet her fears , whatever they might be . The bride and groom took a room at Willard 's Hotel , and left the world , and found it . Earlier in the day she had written a letter to her father and mother telling them of her inescapable decision , and promising to write again to ask their views . She was sorry to be disobedient , and had no wish to be forever cut off from her family . Would they not remember their own days of courtship , and understand hers , and by their consent let her return to be married in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . The newly married couple took the city into their love during Hiram 's last days . They walked everywhere , only not daring to come too near to the Capitol , where Justice Dryden maintained his chambers , and where inadvertently they might encounter him . They strolled past an auction where a red flag stood outside on a staff , and where a Negro walked up and down ringing a big bell to call a crowd . " Bless the captain and his lady , " he cried , " come in , come in . " They did not enter the auction , but they rejoiced to hear the blessing . They bought hothouse strawberries for fifteen cents a quart , " with the hulls on , " and ate them as they strolled . They hid when they thought someone approached whom she might know . They walked all the way out to Georgetown to the point opposite the islandin the Potomac where a Negro regiment was encamped , and in the evening blue they saw the tents like great lanterns over the river , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep into the tenderest feeling of those who listened . At the Georgetown wharves sailing ships were moored and their masts rose on the sky like scratches on glass . One morning they sawp218coming along Pennsylvania Avenue a cavalry escort followed by a mud-spattered black barouche with its top laid open . In it rode President Lincoln , alone . He was making some marks with a pencil on a fold of paper held atop his high knee . He and his equipage looked seedy , common and poor . Hiram saluted his Commander in Chief and Jessica lifted her hand in its lavender silk mesh glove , and the President looked up just then , saw them , and gravely removed his scuffed top hat to bow to them . As his horses drew him by , something about the young pair arrested his gaze , and he turned to see them as long as he comfortably could . He smiled and nodded , smiled and nodded . " I think he knows we are just married , " said Jessica . " How do you suppose he would know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the fifth day Hiram was to leave by railroad for the West , where his regiment had been shifted to the campaign in Tennessee . Jessica went with him to the station . They wandered for almost a mile along the tracks looking for his troop train . As they searched , he said , " I have made up my mind , Jess . " " Yes , Hiram . To what ? " " To what I 'm going to do after the War . " " Oh ? " " I 'm going to apply for a regular commission and stay in the Army . We 're going to make a career of it . I do n't know why I did n't think of it when I was talking to your father . " She halted and faced toward him . She almost embraced him right there in front of all those hundreds of other soldiers looking for their railroad cars . But she knew he hated demonstrations or any conspicuousbehavior , and she withheld the hug she wanted to give him . But her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " My darling , it will be exactly the life for us . I will be a perfect army wife and you are already a great officer . " " I do n't know about great officer , but we 'll be doing honorable work , and with luck I will become somebody , and our children will have position . We 'll be poor ; but I already know how to be , and you can learn . " She laughed in delight at the terms of his ambition not only for himself but for her . As for their children  --  she begged of her heart that she would have their first child as soon as possible . The Warp219still carried dreadful risks . If she must lose him she would still have him in his child . She accused herself for what seemed thoughts disloyalto his life  --  that she should even consent to imagine him gone forever . But her good sense was equal to her love , and she was as she was . Searching along the tracks of the busy railroad yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choke on grief . But in honor of the soldiers all about , they remained brisk and impassive . When the time came they said farewell to each other in a civil fashion , and each blessed the other for showing little emotion in a moment of extremity . His by nature , hers by breeding , this was their manner then and forever . Jessica went home , and she smiled to realize that by this she meant the room at Willard 's Hotel . But she could not afford to remain there , for she must begin at once to use cleverly the money her husband had left with her . She would miss the convenience of the offices in NewspaperRow across from Willard 's on Fourteenth Street , for the war news was posted several times a day in the windows there . But she could still walk by here every day to follow the campaign in Tennesseeand share what she could of her husband 's days . Soon she found a room in a boardinghouse in Ninth Street for seven dollars a month . She wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hoped her answer would come soon , but it did not , and she did not sit and wait for it . It was her opinion that more than ever , now , as an officer 's wife , she must proceed with her war work . Not quite able to understand why , she did not want to return to the Armory Square Hospital where she had found her love . Instead , she went to the Anacostia Hospital and again entered upon the duties of a volunteer visitor . Once again she read letters and wrote answers for the wounded . She brought an orange , or a page of engravings of the War from Harper 's Weekly ( the wounded men far from shunning the news or likeness of battle were eager for these ) , or even a penny toy bought from a street vendor . It always touched her to know that it was never the value of such little gifts that gave them meaning for her patients . The triflep220in each instance was treasured simply as novelty or change . That so little could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . And when some fellow whom she had brought to smile and speak with her little mercies ended by dying in lonely agony or pure resignation , she seemed less able than before to bear it . There were perhaps forty military hospitals in Washington . She thought about the inhabitants of them all . She overworked in her own , and one day a doctor cautioned her . " You must not continue too steady and too long in the air and influences of the hospitals . " He looked more closely at her . " Are you married ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Do you think you ought to see someone about your condition ? " " I suppose so . I have wondered . " " There is sometimes a sort of look , or more , even an air  --  if it is true , then you should be even more careful about doing too much here . " In answer to this advice , she reduced her hours at the hospital , and instead , took long , slow walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hoped to encounter her father . Nobody'spride  --  meaning his  --  would be outraged if accident should throw together a father estranged from his daughter . She longed to see him . She felt sure he hungered for her , despite his silence , and the silence he must have imposed on her mother . But she did not meet him . Work on the unfinished Capitol seemed to progress very slowly ; indeed , in wartime it was practically at a standstill . She used to tell herself that today she must wander over to see if any progress had been made on the dome since her last inspection , and if in the act she should chance to see a tall , heavy , beloved presence on the steps of the Capitol , who knew what might happen ? In the course of those days she went to see the physician who attended her family and had known her all her life . He confirmed the intuitive diagnosis of the army doctor . He was astonished to hear that she had been married , though to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would you tell my mother for me ? " she asked . " She does not know ? Mothers always know . " " I have not seen her since my marriage . "  |p221The  old doctor was willing to let it go at that . He patted Jessica 's hand . " If you do n't want to tell her yourself , then indeed I shall , " he said . " I 'd love to tell her , but they do not want to see me . " Since her family had not acknowledged her last letter , she could not bring herself to write to them again . " Leave it to me , " said the doctor . Late that very afternoon her mother came to see her in the Ninth Street rooming house . Isabel Dryden was grieved , but too she was stirred by the passionate independence of her child  --  and now she was touched to the heart by the news which the doctor had brought . She embraced Jessica , weepingvery briefly , and then sat down and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me all your feelings  --  physicalfeelings , I mean . The doctor had n't time . All he said was he was sure . " They talked for half an hour about the sensations , duties , woes and joys of child-bearing . Mrs. Dryden was deeply interested , and she was also able to give her daughter much good advice . She was also realistic in worldly terms , and she would always feel responsible for her daughter 's well-being . Opening her black velvet and jet reticule , she brought out a narrow leather case and handed it to Jessica . She looked about at the small , frayed but clean , rented room which so far promised to be the recurring atmosphere of her daughter 's world , and she said , " I must give you this , now , in private , my darling , while I have the chance . " Jessica knew what was in the case , for she had played with it as a child , and had seen it brought out into the light of evening gaieties at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small diamonds in a long loop  --  an heirloom from her side of the family . " I know , " said Mrs. Dryden flatly , " that Hiram Prescott has not a dollar in the world , or a prospect , either , and I can not bear to think that you might ever be in want . You must keep my **25;2069;TOOLONG against just such a moment , if it should ever come , my petty . " Jessica made a gesture which her mother repudiated . She wanted neither thanks nor protest . " Fortunately , " added Mrs. Dryden , " it is mine to give quite freely , as it did not come from your father . Even so , I think he would object if he knew this . " " He is angry , then , Mama ? " A look of misery passed across Isabel 's eyes . For a strange instant she looked like her husband , or so Jessica thought . " Jessica , my dear , he has never in his life been so shaken by anything . " Jessica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will he ever see me again , do you think ? " Mrs. Dryden thought for a moment , and Jessica knew she was estimating just what degree of heartening deceit must now be invoked . This frightened her really . Presently Mrs. Dryden said , " I think he may , eventually . But I think  --  yes , I do certainly think , even after today 's news  --  I think you should not risk coming home just yet . " The two women understood each other . It increased both their heartaches . " I must tell you , though , " said Jessica , to change the subject and fling out a line of hope , " that Hiram does too have prospects . He will remain in the Army as an officer . " " Oh ? " Mrs. Dryden swiftly evaluated this news and liked it . " Your great-grandfather Mercier was a colonel in the Revolution . One of General Washington 's Frenchmen . How will you like the Army ? " " I am made for it . " Her mother laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lip thoughtfully then , and said , " In time , this may make a difference to your father . " Jessica flushed . Her heart was sore and she wanted no concessions based on external advantages . But she was so happy to see her mother that she repressed scornful words that wanted saying , and for another quarter of an hour Mrs. Dryden dwelled delicately but with realism on the state of marriage , thankful , if Jessica must be lost to the family , that she was so sure in her happiness , and so proud of her choice . Jessica , again alone , agreed that her mother 's advice to let time heal her father 's feeling was probably good advice . Yet if she could not be where Hiram was , she hungered to be home again in Lafayettep223Square . There was where she wanted to bring her child to the world . There was where , if she could , she would wait out the War with her infant son  --  she was positive that Hiram would have a son  --  and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would forge a living link between his father and his grandfather . It was a tender and powerful daydream , and she awoke from it many times to the realization that it broke apart each time on the rock of her father 's hardness . At this her own pride would stiffen out of loyalty to Hiram , and she would say , " No , I will remain alone . " But in a few days , her own loneliness made her think more and more of her father 's , and one afternoon when a thin snow was falling , and the sky over the Potomac showed pearly drifts of light that changed with the thickening of the air , she walked to Willard 's Hotel and took a seat in one of the cars of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad , that ran to the Capitol . She felt a little tired and sickish , as her mother had warned her she would . The car would start soon . The horses were already harnessed . A stable scent of straw and ammonia rose from the red velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poplar blinds and damask draperies at the windowsshe could see the snow coming down harder . It was getting late . It was getting dark . She was done with waiting for accidents to throw her together with her father . She went expressly to find him when the day 's sitting of the Supreme Court was ended . The driver took his place and jangled his bell and cracked his whip . The car moved out through the snow . Her heart was beating fast and hard . At the Capitol , soldiers of the 8th Massachusetts Regiment , who were barracked in the Capitol rotunda , were now in spite of the snowstorm drilling on the north grounds . Jessica left the car and walked part way up the steps of the building which matched the drifting flakes , gray-white , in her vision . She stood outside and watched the gas lamps come on in the dusk through the falling snow . She felt a pang for the sorrows to which men and women sometimesclung out of pride , and she prayed for anyone who fed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
