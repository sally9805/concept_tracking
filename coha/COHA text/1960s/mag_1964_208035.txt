It has always been the proud boast of the U.S. armed forces that their pilots would go to extravagant lengths to rescue comrades in trouble . Helicopters flap into impossible places to save plane-crash survivors ; skindivers drop to the aid of downed astronauts ; search-and-rescue craft crisscross vast areas of ocean . And now the lifesaving arsenal has a new weapon : the military Skyhook developed by Connecticut Inventor Robert E. Fulton , Jr . <P> <P> Once its target is located , a Skyhook rescue plane sends a 400-lb. , do-it-yourself kit drifting downward by parachute . The bulky package , which is buoyant enough to float if it lands on water , contains a cylinder filled with helium and 500 ft. of woven nylon line with a special suit attached to one end , a balloon to the other . The man to be rescued must be in good enough physical shape to do a few simple things : put on the suit and inflate the balloon with helium . Once the big bag rises to the full length of the line , the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 450 ft. , zeroing in on the nylon line . A V-shaped fork , attached to the plane 's nose , guides the line into a locking device . Although the plane is moving at 150 m.p.h. , the man being rescued is lifted with less of a jolt than the force of a 6-ft. jump . The man goes up almost vertically before he begins tracing a curved path into a position somewhat below and to the rear of the plane . The relative gentleness of the takeoff and the curved trajectory result from the interaction of several forces : the man 's weight and air resistance , the speed and altitude of the plane , and the stretchability of the woven nylon line , which absorbs shock as it lengthens . Within five minutes of liftoff , the man is hoisted aboard the plane . <P> The Navy , which got into the act first , has been perfecting Skyhook rescues for seven years . Earlier this year , the Army used the technique to lift 35 men , including two Special Forces generals , during exercises at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying the method , and 48 Lockheed C-130 transports have been modified with the forks and winches needed for Skyhook lifts . " I 've never experienced anything like it in my military career , " says Special Forces veteran Sergeant First Class Johnny Dolin . " First there is a slight tug at the shoulders , then you 're soaring through the air like a bird . "
