A t 11:27 on the morning of January 20 , 1969 , the motorcade bearing the Vice President-elect of the United States passed through the military cordon that sealed off the Capitol Plaza . It had snowed heavily the day before and most of the night , and at dawn the snow had turned to sleet , so that now the Capitol dome , the abandoned inauguration stands and the naked elms seemed sheathed in a patina of glass . Signs of the night 's violence , most of which had occurred on the House side of the Capitol , had been obliterated bY the snowfall . Most of the rioters hadsurrendered to the fury of the storm and gone home , but a few hundred still clustered on the steps of the Supreme Court where they had been driven by the Army 's bayoneted skirmish line after the predawn attempt to rush the House of Representatives . Their jeers for the arrival of the Vice President-elect were inaudible across the great park separating the Court from the Capitol . Still , the Secret Service escort was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnel under the Senate steps and sealed both ends with agents carrying submachine guns before permitting him and his wife . to leave the car . His face was taut with rage as he stepped to the curb . " I do n't want to see any more guns ! " he told Special Agent R. J. Worley. chief of his bodyguard detail . This is still a democracy . " His wife 's hand touched his gently . " We 're keeping the Senate waiting , " she murmured . ' Of ou rse ? " he said . " I 'm sorry . " Then . patting Worley on the elbow : " Just have them put the machine guns away , OK ? " He would take the oath in the Senate chamber . Many , including some of his oldest political enemies , had counseled against such a modest beginning . Richard Russell of Georgia , the Senate 's Southern patriarch , had made a special trip to Hickory Hill to urge the wisdom of taking the oath on the traditional inauguration platform erected over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no President on January 20 to stand up before the world on that platform and put his hard on the Bible . " Russell had argued . " then it 's yourplain duly as Vice President to do it for them , " Robert Kennedy had weighed the argument for 10 days . ever since it had become apparent that a bitterly divided House of Representatives might not elect Lyndon Johnson or anyone else , for that matter President by Inauguration Day . Having already been chosen Vice President by the Senate , Kennedy had found himself about to assume the unenviable office of Vice President of a nation unable to elect a President . Under the 12th Amendment to the Constitution , he would have to " act as President , as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President " until the House could break its deadlock and choose a President . Asserting leadership of the country as acting President would be almost as perilous as failure to assert it . Street mobs were already shouting for insurrection , and around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralysis to predictions of a military seizure of power . Kennedy had decided against taking the President 's place on the inauguration platform . To do so , he reasoned , would needlessly fuel the argument already being made that he was " usurping " the Presidency . For the same reason he had decided not to take up residence in the White House itself , but only to work in its offices . This last . he concluded , was essential ; the country must not be permitted to think of its highest office as vacant . Many of Lyndon Johnson 's friends talked cruelly of Kennedy 's moving into the office " while the chair was still warm , " but Johnson himself had never been more superb . " You 're going to lead the country , " he had told Kennedy two days before the inauguration . " You may have to lead it just a few days , but no matter how long it 's going to be . you 're going to have to be the leader . " He had urged Kennedy to occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes Kennedy would stand before the Senate and swear to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States , so help me God , and then ride down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House and sit where his brother had sat this same morning eight years ago Everett Dirksen , old and tired and unaccustomedly grave , was among the committee appointed by the Senate to escort the Vice President-elect to the well of the chamber . As the group paused outside , Dirksen placed his big farmer 's hand almost tenderly on Kennedy 's shoulder . " We 're going to come through it all right , " he said . " Thank you. - Kennedy said . " I 'll need all your help . " Behind Dirksen stood Sen. John G. Tower of Texas . Kennedy reached out to shake his hand . and Tower said , " I 'm glad it 's not me . " " It could just as easily have been you " Kennedy said . It could have indeed . It had been one of the strangest campaigns in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 100 men , sitting in this chamber . choosing between Robert Kennedy and John Tower for the bizarre office of acting President of the United States . The men who dream of the Presidency of the United States are most especially cursed , for all but one are fated to suffer the death of dreams . In 1968 there were many dreamers . Some , like Hubert Humphrey , Richard Nixon and Nelson Rockefeller , had pursued the dream for years , had felt it within their grasp , then seen it slip away . But for all three it was still alive as 1968 began . Others . like Ronald Reagan , the actor turned politician . and George Romney ? " a man with a jaw of steel , a heart of gold and a brain of mush , " the cruel joke went  --  were running for the first time . The decline of Lyndon Johnson had produced a bumper crop of dreamers . In Johnson 's own party here was Sen. Eugene McCarthy , a curious mixture of urbanity. shyness , high principle and determination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans had rank upon rank of fallback candidates , dark horses , darker horses and invisible horses . As the Republican confusion of late spring eroded into the chaos of midsummer , there was scarcely a state in the Union that did not harbor at least one Republican who woke in the night and asked himself . " Why could n't it be me ? " Just before the first ballot at Miami Beach , the Republican Convention 's 1,333 votes were divided among no fewer than 15 candidates , most of whom still faintly hoped that lightning yet might strike . To understand what happened in that bizarre climactic moment at Miami Beach that August , we must understand the events that all through the middle months of 1968 had threatened to tear the Republican Party to pieces . These began quietly in New Hampshire where Nixon and Romney fought head-to-head for the psychological advantage of victory in the nation 's first primary As so often in New Hampshire , it was a strange . sometimes comic , largely meaningless campaign . Nixon had entered it as a heavy favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who make candidates . admired his long experience in politics and world affairs , his years of devoted labor for the party and his ideological ambiguities . which dampened the murderous impulses between Republican liberals and conservatives . If he could overcome in the primaries the stigma of his defeats  --  for President in 1960. for governor of California in 1962 ? and demonstrate that he was not " a loser , " he would be the inevitable Republican choice to oppose Johnson . And so Nixon accepted the challenge of always unpredictable New Hampshire , a state with fewer than 150,000 Republican voters , no organizational machinery that a politician could work with , and a record for treating front-runners capriciously . Romney , who had skidded in the polls from front-runner to nobody 's first choice , found New Hampshire equally inescapable . A victory might start him on a bandwagon ; a defeat might eliminate him at the outset . And so he plodded through the snow , shaking hands , talking about spiritual strength and accepting jars of homemade preserves , while Nixon played the statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers of commerce , eating chicken dinners and accepting jars of homemade preserves . Both men sparred with the war issue . Romney talked bafflingly of the Vietcong " infrastructure " and sent audiences away wondering what an " infrastructure " was . Nixon said Johnson had committed himself to a war he could neither win nor end . He said it was time to remove a President who had " anchored America in quicksand " and elect one who could " conclude the war " and " revive the idealism of America . " The skeptical New Hampshire Yankees went away mumbling that he had not said how the war might be " concluded . " New Hampshire voted on March 12 . Both men lost . Not numerically . of course . Nixon led the poll and technically won the election with 32,518 votes to Romney 's 28,243 . Both men , however . were conspicuously rejected by 35,082 New Hampshire Republicans who had gone to the polls and written in the names of Sen. Charles Percy of Illinois , Ronald Reagan and Nelson Rockefeller . The write-in vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 2,220 . In New York next day Nixon held a press conference and tried to dilute the poison of the New Hampshire returns . He emphasized the state 's unreliability as a bellwether . The size of the write-ins for Percy and Reagan , he said , obviously restilted from covert campaigns directei I by political-promotion firms in Boston or New York . This later proved correct . ) The real test . he said , would come in I he Wisconsin primary of Ai Not everyone was fiersuaded that nothing had changed . There was . for example , the case of Nelson Rockefeller . Committed to Romney , Rockefeller had resisted all pressures to open a campaign of his own even as Romney 's sputtered and stalled . For Republican liberals and moderates to light each other . he reasoned . would he tantamount to nominating a conservative , as Goldwater had been nominated in 1964 . It was essential to unite behind a single candidate , he insisted . Romney was his choice . Despite polls indicating that he was the party 's biggest vote-getter , Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few in the party believed him . The day after New Hampshire the switchboard in his Manhattan office broke down twice under the load . Among the callers were Governors John Love of Colorado . Spiro Agnew of Maryland and John Chafee of Rhode Island . All their messages were much the same : Romney had done badly and would probably do worse in Wisconsin . Reagan had scored an important psychological gain in the East where he was weakest . With Nixon badly hurt . his support would begin to fragment . If much of it went to Reagan , the conservatives might again dominate the convention . 11 was urgent . they argued , for Rockefeller to act swiftly , before the mood of the convention could set . Romney should be persuaded to withdraw and declare for Rockefeller . Rockefeller listened , fiddled with his glasses , and said no . It would be suicidal , he argued , to abandon Romney before he had faced the critical challenge of Wisconsin . In any case , he concluded , he himself was simply not interested in running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fresh from his big write-in vote in New Hampshire . Percy flew up from Washington on the shuttle and spent two hours that evening at Rockefeller 's Fifth Avenue apartment . Next clay Percy announced that he would make several appearances in both Wisconsin and Oregon , where state authorities had placed his name on the primary ballot . PERCY ENTERS RACE was the headline in the Washington Star . The mystery was whether he had entered with Rockefeller 's blessing . If so . there may have been substance to Romney 's celebrated remark  --  made to a group of Chicago businessmen in July when he was out of the race  --  that he had been " carved up and roasted on Fifth Avenue . " Percy appealed to the same type of Republican as Romney  --  the internationalist progressive uneasy about a military adventure in Asia  --  and Percy 's presence on the Wisconsin stump would inevitably split Romney 's support . Rockefeller insisted that he had not encouraged Percy to campaign . " 1 am supporting Governor Romney , " he told Lawrence Spivak on Mee , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percy to go into Wisconsin , when that would reduce the . governor 's chances of carrying the state . " " If Romney and Percy both eliminated each other , ; oyernor , " asked Spivak , " would n't you be the logical candidate of those who want a more liberal alternative than Nixon or Reagan ? " " Gentlemen . " said Rockefeller . " how many times do 1 have to say it ? I am simply not interested in becoming President of the United States . " Of the 15 presidential primaries held in the United States none is more important than Wisconsin 's . Its outcome , matched against New Hampshire 's , may give the first evidence of a national trend . A convincing victory in Wisconsin is particularly convincing to the professionals . because the state presents in microcosm many of the same big voting blocs that a party must carry to win the Presidency . The urban-industrial metropolitan area around Milwaukee . with its racial and national minority groups and its strong labor organization , tests a candidate 's ability to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant Catholic vote and , along the Fox River in the east , a concentration of intensely conservative Republicans . The mood of the farm vote is tested through the central and northwestern farmlands , and the small towns that dot the slate offer a reading on the state of mind of small-town Midwest America . A restless Negro minority in Milwaukee creates the racial tensions that test a candidate 's ability to cope with this most dangerous of all issues . Wisconsin is important for two other reasons . First , its primary law requires state officials to put on the ballot every man whose " candidacy is generally advocated or recognized in the nationalnews media . " Like it or not . every contender goes on . To get off he must sign a forbidding affidavit that " he is not and does not intend to become a candidate for the office of President . " Second , Wisconsin 's is the nation 's only " open " primary . This means that voters , regardless of party ties , may cast their ballots in either the Republican or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most resolute nay-sayers , and it tests their appeal among voters of both parties . And yet , as in all elections , the outcome may turn on the most trivial event . as in fact it did in 1968 . On the afternoon of March 31 , two days before the primary , Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy arrived in Milwaukee for the last of three " non-political appearances " scheduled during the primary season . He was to speak that night to a convention of The Lofty Order of Treetop Trimmers on " the spirit of buckskin America . " 1 At the Pfister Hotel the Reagans found the sidewalk barred by some 500 chanting peace demonstrators . their distaste for Reagan 's hawkish stand on Vietnam articulated in such placard graffiti as RONNIE LOVES His GAS CHAMBER and COFFIN MAKERS OF AMERICA SUPPORT REAGAN . When the Reagans left their car , a burly woman in furs lunged forward and shouted , " Fascist ! " A policeman made a had move . There was shoving . A policeman went down . Nightsticks began to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nasty mob . Nancy Reagan was struck on the head with a placard . A news photographer caught her an instant later wiping blood from her cheek . Printed across the state next day , the picture probably cost Nixon even more voles than Ilse one it Reagan himself . overcoat splattered with while paint , trying to reason with a shrieking , frizzle-haired college youth . In April the voters of Wisconsin would go to the polls to deliver apologies to the Reagans and to show the nation that they were civilized hosts whose sentiments were not expressed by street mobs . Fifteen minutes on a Milwaukee sidewalk had erased weeks of hard , effective campaigning by Richard Nixon . Until that moment Nixon had done well in Wisconsin . The polls forecast victory . The Republican organization , always partial to Nixon anyhow , had worked brilliantly for him , and Nixon himself had finally dealt with the war issues with a candor that was effective . He himself , lie said , could offer no specific alternatives for ending the war . He did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not promise to lead you down the easy road of magic solutions , but I will do my best to bring America peace with honor so that we can start moving ahead once more with the business of America . " Romney. to bolster his waning strength , went to Gettysburg and asked his old friend . General Eisenhower . to travel with him in ' Wisconsin . The general , pained by the demands of politics , told Romney that he would nevertheless be glad to appear in Wisconsin . When Romney told the press , Nixon hurried down to Gettysburg , and the general called in the reporters and said Governor Romney had given the wrong impression . What he had meant to say , he explained , was that he would appear in Wisconsin at a rally attended by all Republicans , provided of course that they wanted him , which he was n't sure of at all , considering all the various factors , and as a matter of fact , he himself did n't know whether it was such a good idea . seeing as how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the Eisenhower rally be forgotten . Wisconsin voted on April 2 . David Broder wrote in the Washington Post next day that it was " the worst massacre in the West since the Little Big Horn . " The most startling result was the massive vote of no confidence returned against Lyndon Johnson . Sen. Eugene McCarthy , whose quiet campaign against Johnson 's war policy had never seemed to catch fire , whipped the President by more than 60,000 votes . George Wallace , the Alabama race-baiter who had been entered as a Democrat  --  it was as a third-party candidate that he later terrorized both parties  --  polled more than 81,000 votes . For Republicans , Wisconsin presented only a puzzle . Clearly , they had the Presidency within grasp . But they had no candidate to take it . Here are the Republican voting tables : Nixon : 218,918 ; Romney : 210,555 : Reagan : 164,985 ; Percy : 95,671 . Republican professionals quickly translated these statistics into the following conclusions : 1 . Nixon , polling less than one third of the vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loser . " His chance of winning the nomination was badly , perhaps fatally , hurt . 2 Romney was eliminated . 3 . Percy 's fourth-place finish , far behind Reagan and even farther behind Romney , suggested that he was not the liberal " backup " candidate for 1968 that his big New Hampshire write-in had made him appear . " Dead for ' 68 " was the verdict . 4 Reagan had again shown surprising strength , but it had to be weighed cautiously . To what extent was it a fluke , a meaningless " apology vote " from the embarrassed citizens of Wisconsin ? 5 . Rockefeller would have to be considered . " What trend do you see after Wisconsin ? " Chruston Morton was asked at a news conference . " The trend . " said Morton , " is that there is no trend . The people are tired of Lyndon Johnson and do n't want anybody in his place . " " Who 'll be the front-runner when the convention opens in Florida ? " " Nobody , " said Morton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an accurate prophecy . The first result of Wisconsin was Romney 's withdrawal from the campaign . The second was Nixon 's decision not to withdraw from the campaign . This had not been his first inclination . I t was Leonard Hall , his old friend and lieutenant , who , during a long afternoon at Nixon 's Manhattan apartment , talked him out of withdrawing . Hall was one of those rare men who devote their lives to the study and practice of presidential politics out of sheer love of the art . He had been G.O.P. national chairman under Eisenhower , had secured Nixon 's renomination for the Vice Presidency in 1956 and had labored for Nixon in the losing campaign of 1960 . In 1967 he had signed on with Romney , despite a long-standing dislike for Romney 's sponsor , Nelson Rockefeller . On April 3 , immediately after Romney told him he was quitting the race . Hall telephoned Nixon in New York and urged him to do nothing until they could talk . They met on April 5 . Nixon was strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenacity and decisiveness in the face of public hostility , but this day he talked sympathetically of Adlai Stevenson . Stevenson , he told Hall , had shown Americans how to lose with grace . Like Stevenson , he said , he lacked the ability to rouse massive public enthusiasm and , like Stevenson , he wanted to leave public life with a smile to be remembered by . Hall was a big , ebullient man with a total passion for winning . Losing , gracefully or otherwise , bored him . When Nixon had finished . he changed the mood of the meeting with a single sentence . For God 's sake , Dick . we 're not talking about a set of tennis ! Now listen " Hall talked in a monologue for half an hour . then Nixon began to interrupt . The conversation lasted all afternoon . The nub of it was that Nixon would remain a candidate , hold as many delegates as he could , and try to accumulate more . No candidate was likely to arrive at Miami Beach with enough delegates to grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who could most effectively play the backroom game of coalition politics . By August Nixon might yet be in the strongest position of all . But if he was not , he should be able to speak with a loud voice in shaping the party 's future . " What about Nelson ? " Nixon asked . Hall shook his head . " In a brokered convention ? " he asked . " They 'll never take him . There 'll he too many people who 'd rather die first , " Three weeks after Wisconsin , at 5:30 on the afternoon of April 22 , Vice President Hubert Humphrey came to the White House . The President had phoned and asked him to drop by to discuss the Democratic Convention . The two men met alone . There was no record of their conversation . Over dinner in the White House that evening , the President talked privately with Secretary of State Dean Rusk . Afterward , around 10:45 , he telephoned Sen. Robert Kennedy , who was enter-taming a dozen friends at Hickory Hill , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I linut telling his guests where he was going . At 4:30 the next afternoon the President summoned the White House correspondents to his office . " I have a couple of announcements , " he began . " Mr. Dean Rusk has resigned today as Secretary of State ? " The AP and UPI men started for the door , " You better hold on a minute , " the President said , and while they waited he talked movingly about his affection for Rusk . The Secretary , he said , had wanted for months to return to private life , The President had refused to let him go , because he considered Rusk " irreplaceable . " But now , he went on , the doctors had warned that without immediate release from " the terrible strains of this struggle to preserve the peace , " Rusk 's health would he permanently endangered . " No job in the United States , including the Presidency itself , is more vital than the position of Secretary of State , " he read from a prepared statement . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man I know who is capable of carrying its awesome burdens . That man is one who has never said no , no matter how awful the challenge , when his country has called him . Once again he has volunteered to heed that call . " And so , I am sending the Senate the nomination of Vice President Hubert Humphrey as Secretary of State . In order to avoid a possible constitutional conflict , Mr. Humphrey is resigning as Vice President of the United States . " The AP and UPI men bolted . " Does this mean Humphrey wo n't be available for renomination for the Vice Presidency ? " a reporter asked . " The Vice President feels , and I agree , that the responsibility for preserving the peace should be above politics , " the President said . " Who 'll take his place on the ticket ? " " That will be entirely up to the convention , " the President said . ' ' I would not presume to interfere in the free choice of the delegates . " " But an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reservations against having Senator Kennedy on the ticket ? " " Senator Kennedy is one of our great public servants , " said the President . " His presence on the ticket would do the party honor . " Thus , with characteristic unpredictability and lightning strokes . Johnson dumped Humphrey and created the Johnson-Kennedy ticket . Breaking the news to Humphrey , he later told a friend , was " the hardest thing I ever did in my life . " Eugene McCarthy 's victory in Wisconsin , however , capped the evidence that only the most drastic measures could save Johnson from defeat in November , and Johnson was a man who. above all else , detested defeat . Kennedy would bring indisputable fresh strength to the ticket , with his allure for the young . the alienated intellectuals and the anti-war Democrats  --  all of whom had turned out for McCarthy in Wisconsin , Kennedy on the ticket would also heal the dangerous breach between Johnson Democrats and Kennedy Democrats . Although many of Kennedy 's admirers were at first shocked that he would associate himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically wise . His mother , Rose Kennedy , put it more succinctly than Walter Lippmann . " Why should n't he take it ? " she asked . " He 's got nothing to lose . " Nothing to lose and everything to gain . Johnson re-elected would be a lame-duck President powerless to exact from him the total loyalty he had demanded of Humphrey and , in fact , powerless to prevent Kennedy from taking control of the party . And if the Democrats lost , Kennedy would be faced with the same problem he would face in any event that of keeping his presidential prospects alive until 1972 , Humphrey , after his April 22 chat with the President , did not go back to his ( nee , though a group of Minnesota schoolchildren were there to shake his hand . Instead , he drove home to his wife , Muriel . " I 've got some news , Bucks . " he said . " Muriel cried a little . " he later wrote in his memoirs , and then we had an early dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rioting began . Twenty-seven died in Philadelphia . most of them Negroes . Cincinnati went up almost simultaneously . Then Baltimore . the worst since Detroit in the summer of 1967 . In New York , John Lindsay walked the streets by night , turned on the hydrants for the children on the Iirst muggy clay , and prayed . Lyndon Johnson 's popularity was sagging again . Gallup showed his popular support seven points lelow its spring peak . Kennedy 's addition to the ticket had helped destroy Eugene McCarthy 's threat in the California primary . but the anti-war Democrats were already murmuring that Kennedy had " sold out . " Johnson was being ground in a politics of frustration more bitter than any could remember since the Depression election of 1932 . A seemingly endless war , record food prices . rising taxes , intractable poverty , a surly Congress . and now an incipient revolution of race  --  and Johnson bore the burden of public blame for all Fortunately for Johnson , the Republicans too were caught in the politics of frustration . Despite victories in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his early losses . He had been submerged with a hodgepodge of candidates in the inconclusive Oregon primary of late May . Rockefeller had let his name stand on the Oregon ballot , but had done little better than either Nixon or Reagan . Thus , while the first roses bloomed across America and then fell , the Republicans had come no nearer than they had been in December to choosing a leader . In December division is natural . In June it can he catastrophic . for when the convention approaches and no one yet commands , the tug of war among rival feudal chieftains tends to pull a party to pieces . And so in mid-June the nation 's 26 Republican governors gathered in two sparkling new resort hotels at Lake Eufaula . Okla .. to try to make a President . Working together , they might well pack enough political muscle to name the party 's candidate , Maneuvering to align the governors behind Rockefeller had begun long before the meeting . To Nixon and to all conservatives for whom the name Rockefeller was anathema , the strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banquo 's Ghost . " I 'm just an old has-been , " Barry Goldwater tolrl reporters as he stepped off the plane , ' ' who 's come out here to do whatever I can to make sure we do n't nominate anybody this year who is n't a Republican. - No fluency in political double-talk was required to translate this . " I 'm here to make sure the governors understand they 'll have to light me and my people if they nominate Rockefeller , " he was saving . Contrary to contemporary news stories , it was not Reagan who had persuaded Goldwater to intervene at Lake Eufaula . " Hell . we had all the old Goldwater people sewed up . " Reagan 's special assistant . Lyn Noftiger. reminisced later . " The last thing we wanted was to remind everybody that Ronnie was the candidate of the Goldwater crowd . " It was . in fact , Nixon 's advise- . Leonard Hail , who flew to Arizona to see Goldwater . " Without you , Barry , " Hall said , " the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 ) 23 choice between Johnson and Rocke-feller , " " I 'd hate to have the historians say that I failed to save the country from that . " Goldwater said and turned to his wife . " Pack my swimming trunks , Peggy . It 'll be hot in Oklahoma . " Goldwater 's message to the governors was conveyed in a series of private conversations , but inevitably it leaked to the press . " Goldwater , " Robert J. Donovan wrote in the Los Angeles rimes , " is telling the governors that a Rockefeller nomination will cost the party every electoral vote in the South and infuriate every ' loyal Republican ' who was ' willing to die for the ticket ' in 1964 when Rockefeller ' turned his back on the party . ' " The argument was not persuasive by itself . Coming from Goldwater , however , it could not be shrugged away , for Goldwater could set off the very bloodletting he forecast . The two men who had to be persuaded were Governors James Rhodes of Ohio and Raymond Shafer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one fifth of the votes needed to nominate . If Rhodes and Shafer went for Rockefeller , the other governors ' support would be certain ; if they held back , most of the governors would hold with them . Jim Rhodes . with his 58 delegates , was a big , genial , cunning veteran of the Republican flesh market . In 1964 he had arrived at San Francisco for the convention . sniffed the wind and stampeded immediately for Goldwater . Now he listened passively as Goldwater spoke . At last Rhodes heaved his bulk forward in the wingback chair . " If we nominate Rockefeli. . " he asked , " are you going to support the ticket . Barry ? " " I 'll tell you frankly , Jim  --  I have n't told this to a soul  --  if Rockefeller 's nominated . I 'd have to oppose him . " Rhodes 's silence engulfed the room . and then he said , " That 's a damn hard thing to say , Barry . " " You know me , Jim . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to have to tell them where I stand . " " Why do n't you hold back on that until I 've had time to talk to Shafer ? " Rhodes suggested . Two days later the conference ended without a declaration of unified support for Rockefeller or anyone else . It was a harsh blow to Rockefeller 's hopes . In a press conference that day , he spoke bitterly of " the same old cabal of primitive men who have held the party for ransom for several years . " He seemed to have been under the impression that it was Reagan rather than Nixon who had invoked the menace of Goldwater . His press-conference criticism , which was obviously aimed at Reagan , left an unbridgeable chasm between New York and California . " There has been a concerted attempt here this week to destroy the unity of the Republican Party , " he charged . " Threats have been made , ladies and gentlemen , the kind of threats that have no place in our party , and they have come from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ruin and took us down to the most humiliating defeat in our history . " " Do you believe that Goldwater 's campaign against you is aimed at winning the nomination for Reagan ? " " I doubt it , " said Rockefeller in one of his rare attempts at wit . " Governor Reagan is a little too modern for Mr. Goldwater . The governor 's thinking has already reached 1890 . " Thus the door slammed on the Republican " dream ticket " of 1968 : Rockefeller and Reagan . Across America , July , 1968 , was a month of fire and blood . In 31 days a total of 21 cities from Los Angeles to Boston experienced major riots . Out of the rotting tenements where it had been dammed for generations poured a river of black frustration , hopelessness and hate . Flowing through slum streets . it dashed itself against a barricade of white fear , and the streets blazed , and the desperate , the daring and the innocent bled and died . By the end of July race had replaced Vietnam as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iron military repression " to restore law and order , " announced that he would lead a third-party ticket " to give America back to Americans . " Wallace 's crude animal reaction to the complexities of American society found a sympathetic hearing that summer among millions baffled by the speed at which the future was hurtling upon them and frustrated by their individual impotence . With his snake-oil salesman 's gift for making the rubes believe in miracle cures , Wallace satisfied a deep public yearning to be deluded with promises of easy solutions . Demonstrations ? Riots ? Wallace : " If I ever get to be President , and any of these demonstrators lay down in front of my car , it 'll be the last car they ever lay down in front of . " Poverty ? Welfare ? Wallace : " In Alabama we do n't pay able-bodied folks not to work . " The relationship between poverty and crime ?

The riots had not created George Wallace , but they inflated him into a major political power . The riots did create John V. Lindsay , the Republican mayor of New York . Night after night that summer , Lindsay , tieless. coatless , shirt-sleeves rolled above the elbow , had become a familiar stroller in the turbulent streets of Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant . " I 'm sitting on a bomb , " he confided to a friend . " If it blows there 's not a thing I can do . " What he could do beforehand , however , was to try to create a feeling that someone in authority cared . Whether because of Lindsay or in spite of him , New York did not explode that July . but it was a close thing . On July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy had been shot by a policeman , began a march on a Harlem police station . Lindsay caught the police calls on his car 's shortwave and went immediately to the station . In the next block a crowd humming with anger was already in motion . Alone . Lindsay left his car and , alone , he began walking slowly toward the advancing crowd . The hum became a roar of anger . When the interval between Lindsay and marchers had closed to half a block , someone threw an empty bottle . It missed and shattered . Lindsay paused . then , raising his right arm high in the traditional gesture of conciliation , he slowly resumed his advance . The crowd surged forward until , as though it had been a single person , its resolution broke , and it hesitated , and then stopped . There was a full minute of absolute quiet in the street as Lindsay continued his slow advance . And then , with perspiration soaking his rumpled white shirt , he stopped 10 feet from the front rank . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. " he said in a quiet , conversational tone . " we 'll go tip there to the police station together and get the police commissioner up here and find out exactly what 's going on . " In a rare stroke of political luck a news photographer had happened into the Harlem station house shortly before Lindsay 's arrival and had photographed his lonely advance against the mob . It was a beautiful picture evoking mythical memories of lonely lawmen walking with death in Tombstone , Spread across the nation and garnished with overstated news accounts reporting that Lindsay had saved New York from holocaust , it was the stuff that makes instant heroes . Flying from San Francisco to New York next morning , Richard Nixon saw the photograph in the papers . According to aide Charles McWhorter , who was with him on the flight , Nixon studied the picture for 10 minutes , then handed McWhorter the paper . " What do you think of that . Charlie ? " It seems likely that Nixon was too absorbed in his own private tragedy on that flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had labored to stay in contention until the convention , so that he would arrive at Miami Beach with enough delegates to barter a victory out of the corridor politics at which he excelled . With Romney and Percy eliminated . he had needed a way to stop Rockefeller , and Goldwater had done it for him . With Rockefeller stopped . he had needed a way to stop a mass swing to Reagan . and Rockefeller 's acid attack on the conservatives had filled the need . With liberals and conservatives split again , the party needed a healer acceptable to both . And so Nixon went to work on the state organizations , one by one . picking up 8 delegates here , 12 there . By mid-July Nixon 's delegate count showed him with a total of 384 votes . A convention is a primitive exercise in addition . With 1,333 delegates , it nominates the man who can add up his count to a simple majority . Thus the magic figure is 667 . Since Lake Eufaula , Reagan had worked his total up to 240 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead , but a lead of small comfort , for a lead that does not grow is a handicap . When politicians start suspecting that the man in the lead lacks the momentum to win . their nerves shatter and they bolt to the man who seems to be gaining . To prevent his lead from becoming an affliction . Nixon needed to make a dramatic gain on the eve of the convention . There was no chance of help from the dozen states with " favorite son " candidates . This left Reagan and Rockefeller . Asking Rockefeller for his 233 was out of the question . When he had run for President in 1960 . Nixon , to avoid a party split . had suffered Rockefeller to summon him to New York for instructions on how the party platform should be rewritten . Nixon had bought harmony at a fearful price in humiliaPICKING THE PRESIDENT I le simply could not bring IIIMSCH to go io once again with hat in hand ' It left Reagan . They met city the night of July 25 in a lodge hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered Reagan the vice-presidential nomination . Reagan had anticipated the offer . 1 le had even rehearsed the method of his reply . " I 'd like to let Nancy consult on this , " he said . While Nixon bit his lip , Reagan asked his wife to join them . " Honey , " said Reagan , " Dick dunks I 'd make a pretty good Vice President . What do you think ? " " Why , that 's extremely kind of Mr. Nixon . " said Nancy Reagan . " But do you know , Mr. Nixon , Ron 's too diffident to say it , but he 's convinced that he 's the only man in the party who can beat Lyndon Johnson this year . " " Oh come on now . Nancy . " Reagan grinned his famous telegenic grin . " You know that 's the way you feel , and it 's not fair to Mr. Nixon not telling it to him straight . Now you stop talking about giving up in the middle of the fight . and you and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her cheek and grinned at Nixon . " I guess she 's right . Dick . You see how it is when you 've got an ambitious wife . What can I do ? " The discussion was closed . " He took it like a man , " Reagan later told a friend . Perhaps . but Nixon was not amused . " It was right out of a 1935 grade-B movie . " he told his wife , Pat . the next night in their Manhattan apartment . " They 'd obviously rehearsed it . That movie actor had deliberately rehearsed it to make me feel like a complete fool . " Outwardly all conventions are circuses , but a convention held in Miami Beach is a circus imposed on a circus . The first delegates and their wives began arriving August 1 . By the weekend the garish strip of sand , plastic , neon , palm trees , nightclubs and instant hotels that is Miami Beach was awash in the heirs of Lincoln . They came in many shapes . Austere Gothic sons and daughters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth custom-tailored big-money boys from New York and Chicago with their Paris-dressed. boarding-school women as lean as rails . Brand-new millionaires from Texas in Roman suits , Neapolitan shoes and Givenchy neckties . Scared offsprings of the Okies from Southern California wearing Robert Hall Bermudas and thick layers of fear  --  fear of Communists . fear of Negroes , fear of revolution , fear of having their split-levels and portable backyard swimming pools snatched away by a dozen hideous nameless conspiracies . Midwestern undertakers , small-town bankers . Cincinnati industrialists , Bible-class teachers , Dixie hardware kings , Oklahoma gas lords . Maryland fox chasers . Colorado cowmen  --  poured into the hot hyperthyroid let's-have-aball atmosphere of Miami Beach . They sweated in the August sun , soaked in the afternoon downpours , baked purple beside swimming pools , coughed up $1.75 a shot for bourbon , watched the strippers , got rolled by hookers , conned by bellboys. saved by solicitous police from the drunk tank and . in general , did all those things associated with having a splendid time at a convention . In the hotel lobbies brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . A Cheyenne . ite man had a hstlight with a I ma lawyer . An aging stockbroker Irian Oregon was reprimanded by police for dropping paper bags of water from Ii is eighth-floor room in the Roney-Plaza Hotel . And sun in g ly weaving in and out of the hilarity and temp wet- . Reagan and Rockefeller stalked Richard Nixon with meat-axes . Everyone in Miami Beach knew that Nixon could not hold his 384 delegates after the first ballot . Confidential counts showed that as many as 200 Nixon delegates were ready to switch to Reagan on the second ballot . Rockefeller 's men also had gone hunting and had done well . Their quarry had been the convention votes staked to the favorite-son candidacies of a dozen governors and senators . The fattest prize of all was Pennsylvania 's 64 votes , now locked up for Governor Shafer . And there was Texas . Texas had 56 votes , and on the first ballot they would go to Sen. John Tower , the short . frecklefaced , red-headed , conservative professor of political science who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial to both Reagan and Rockefeller  --  to Reagan because of its size , to Rockefeller because its conservative cast would counterbalance the heavily liberal complexion of his support . Clifford Case , a shy , donnish senator from New Jersey who favored Rockefeller . had talked with Tower before leaving Washington and advised Rockefeller . " Tower will deal . " The day of the convention 's opening Nixon received information that Rockefeller had already been assured second-ballot support from Romney . Percy . Case , Governor Love of Colorado and Governor Chafee of Rhode Island . In addition , four Nixon delegations were ready to switch 72 votes to Rockefeller on the second ballot . The political reality emerged unmistakably clear to Nixon . Reagan and Rockefeller would both score big second-ballot gains at Nixon 's expense , and when the switches began , Nixon would be picked as clean as a man fallen among a school of piranha . Nixon was not enthralled by this prospect . and he was determined to avoid it . He had weaponry of sorts . There were the 384 votes that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he had a plan . Its success required secrecy and exquisite timing . The night of August 5 , while the convention droned through its opening ritual . Nixon turned down the sound on the television set in his Key Biscayne hideaway and went to work on the telephone . He called four men  --  Rhodes of Ohio , Shafer of Pennsylvania . Tower of Texas and Goldwater . Next morning Rhodes , Shafer and Tower slipped out of their hotels on the Beach and headed for Key Biscayne . They talked with Nixon until noon . The outline of Nixon 's opening statement went roughly as follows : With 80 million persons watching on television the Republican Party could not tolerate a murderous rerun  --  this time between Reagan and Rockefeller  --  of the 1964 bloodletting between conservatives and liberals . If Rockefeller were nominated , the conservatives would surely bolt . Goldwater would see to that . And if Reagan were nominated in a spew of bitterness , the liberals in the crucial Northeastern states would surely defect . To offset his losses in the North east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hot since George Wallace had enleri ' ' race , there was little chance of I 11 ' ; ' ; carrying a single Soutlii .. In short neither was a satisfai , andirlate . What the party needed was a flesh personality . " I am obviously . " Nixon said , " not talking about myself . " Nixon 's meeting with Goldwater occurred that af term sin . Goldwater 's first reaction was fury . Nixon had expected that . Backing Reagan . Goldwater naturally wanted no part of a plan that would circumvent him . Nixon did not ask him to participate in it . All he wanted , he assured Goldwater , was a promise that Goldwater would support the ticket . Goldwater balked . " It 's the only way . Barry , " Nixon said . " Unless you 're willing to support this ticket , you 're going to get Rockefeller nominated on the second ballot . " " That 's nonsense . " said Goldwater . " He wo n't go over four hundred votes . " " He 'll win , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tower this morning . Shafer and Rhodes ca n't take Reagan , and say they 'll come in for Rockefeller if he gets over four hundred on the second ballot . Tower has been offered the Vice Presidency . He 'll go to Rockefeller to collect it . " " They did n't say that ! " " Ask them yourself , Barry. - Nixon was bluffing , of course , but bluffing well . " My way is the only possible chance of stopping Rockefeller , " he said . " And there 's nothing I have to do that 'll make me part of this ? " " The integrity of your commitment to Reagan is n't compromised in any way . All we need is your assurance that if things work out , you wo n't oppose the ticket . Rhodes insists on that , or he 'll go for Rockefeller . " " You have it , " said Goldwater . The nominating speeches began on the third day . That morning Nixon had to confide in a fifth man . He was Rep. Gerald Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford for a guarantee that balloting for the nomination would not begin that night . It was a painless promise for Ford to make . With 15 men to be put in nomination , speeches and demonstrations would consume 10 to 12 hours . As Ford gaveled the convention to order at 1:22 that afternoon , word quietly passed that balloting would be delayed until 11 o'clock next morning . The gears of Nixon 's plan were meshing . In the hall the clerk called , " Alabama ! " and Alabama proudly yielded to the golden state of California by the broad sunswept Pacific shore for the purpose of placing in nomination the name of that great American , Ronald Wilson Reagan . The convention settled in to endure hour upon hour of rococo rhetoric . Around 7 P.M. , when the delegates ' brains had begun to go numb . Governor Agnew of Maryland picked up an odd report . A direct line linked him by phone from his floor seat to Rockefeller 's central communications van outside the halt . Agnew lifted it and was instantly in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now coordinating battle forces for Rockefeller . " Have you got anything on a meeting Nixon is holding later tonight ? " Agnew asked . " Nothing on it . " White said . " What have you heard ? " " Nothing firm . " said Agnew . " One of my people was in the Texas delega ? tion . There 's some talk that Nixon has called a meeting do n't know where-and that Tower is going to he there . " " Find out anything you can , " said White . " I 'll start checking . " White phoned Rockefeller and told 111171 of Agnew 's report . " Do you think he 's planning to throw his delegates to Reagan on the first ballot ? " Rockefeller asked . " That does n't sound right to me , ' said White . " I hear he 's so mad at Reagan about something that he 'd throw in with us first . " " What should we do ? " " Why do n't you have Cliff Case sound out Tower ? Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to just take it out of your pocket and let him have a look at it . " " I still ca n't persuade myself that a guy with his views ought to be Vice President , " Rockefeller said . " You know we need those fifty-six votes , " said White , " and that 's the only way to get them . " " We 'll see . " said Rockefeller . " But if we do n't get anything on this meeting by nine-thirty , I 'll ask Cliff Case to talk with Tower and see what he can learn . " Rockefeller 's delay was crucial . When Case phoned Tower 's suite at 9:45 P.N1. , Tower had just left for the long trip to Nixon 's hideaway . Rhodes and Shafer had been with Nixon since late afternoon . Tower arrived at 10:30 . Then came the congressional leaders  --  Senator Morton of Kentucky , the ineffable Everett Dirksen , and Melvin Laird of Wisconsin . whom some called " the cheese-belt Richelieu . " They were joined just before midnight by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by Senators Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Howard Baker of Tennessee . It was after 1 A.M. when Gerald Ford arrived . By that time Nixon had explained his plan to the seven newcomers who were hearing it for the first time . and by 2 A.M. the dozen men seated around the long mahogany dining-room table sent for another bottle of bourbon and another of Scotch . The first reporters did not arrive until 2:45 A.M. They had been alerted by Cliff White , who had decided to enlist outside help . When the meeting broke at 3 A.M. , the departing leaders were models of noncommunication . " We were merely enjoying a most convivial evening withdel ight ful company . " Dirksen announced . It was the most informative public statement of the night . By breakfast all Miami Beach and most of America knew that an event was about to occur . A coalition of immense power had obviously formed in the night . Obviously , decisions had been taken . Perhaps even a candidate had been chosen . After a year of indecision . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it had always yearned to be . The arena was packed when Ford dropped his gavel at 11:04 A.M. " Mr. Chairman ! " bawled a voice from the rear of the hall . It was Raymond Shafer . " For what purpose does the delegate from Pennsylvania arise ? " " A point of order , Mr. Chairman . " " The gentleman will state it . " " Will the chair advise the convention if the floor is still open at this time for the nomination of additional candidates for the office of President ? " Without consulting his parliamenlariat ) Ford replied , ? Die llot it is still open for nominal ions . " California and New York Reagan 's delegation anti Rockefeller 's hit I heir inicomlione buttons simultaneously , " Mr. Chairman ! " roared two voices as one And just as suddenly a deep-throated animal roar thundered across the arena as delegates and galleries grasped the situation . If Shafer wanted to nominate another candidate , it meant that the coalition had forsaken both Reagan and Rockefeller . " Sit clown ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chant poured down upon the California and New York protesters . In an instant the convention had crystallized into a single living organism determined to know what the kingmakers were about to offer it , determined to crush any effort to deprive it of that knowledge . Ford let the violence of the convention 's will register with the Reagan and Rockefeller forces . When the roar subsided , he suggested that they might like to appeal his ruling to a floor vote . Again the howl . " No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! " Neither Reagan nor Rockefeller could risk incensing the convention further . California and New York sat down . " The chair hearing no objections , " said Ford , " the delegate is advised that the floor is still open for further nominations . Does the gentleman desire to enter a name in nomination ? " " Mr. Chairman , " shouted Shafer , " Pennsylvania requests that her great sister state of Ohio be recognized for the purpose of placing in nomination the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania and Ohio , Shafer and Rhodes , 122 votes , obviously working in combination with Nixon , had reached a choice . Down the center aisle with the gravity of the grand Pooh-Bah . Jim Rhodes of Ohio trod through peals of thunder . slowly mounted the platform , cleared his throat , let the roar subside to a whisper . then to utter silence , and began . " I am here to place in nomination the name of a man who is not with us here in Miami Beach . He is a man whose devotion to the great public duty to which he has set himself is so complete that he has refused to forsake it in order to gather here with us . The challenges that this man is required to meet , day after day and night after night . in this summer of America 's greatest agony , are so enormous that he has refused to allow himself even the slightest respite from his awesome obligations . He is a man , ladies and gentlemen , who night after night , with his sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the people in the streets to bind up ? " " It 's Lindsay . " said Chet Huntley , high up in his broadcasting booth . " John Lindsay ! " screamed a woman 's voice in the gallery , and at the same instant Cliff White hit the telephone to the New York delegation . " Caucus ! " he commanded . " Get them off the floor and caucus ! " As New York caucused in pandemonium , 11 's coalition slowly exposed the s Lrength of its hand , card by card . Shafer and Rhodes : 122 votes . Seconding speeches by Romney , Laird , Morton , Dirksen and Governor Evans of Washington : 160 more votes . Total : 239 . News swept the hall that Nixon was on television , then that Nixon had released his delegates to Lindsay . " Nixon has three hundred and eighty . gay ' , lti 111011 ' . West Virginia idded 11. . consiii 30 and the Dis-s-I of Columbia 9 . With all Stair:A hill I esus and New York recorded , Lindsay had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast its vote ? " asked the clerk . The chairman of the Texas delegation booked across the aisle to where Jim Rhodes sat with his Ohio delegation . Rhodes nodded . " Mister Chairman , Texas proudly casts 56 voles for the next President of the United Slates , John V. Lindsay ! " The New York delegation was returning to its seat as Texas voted . With Texas 's 56 votes , Lindsay had 606 . He needed only 61 more for the nomination . New York . with its 92 committed to Rockefeller , had the power to put him over . In fact , it was powerless not to put him over , no matter how deeply Rockefeller might despise him . Rockefeller simply had no choice . Nixon had presented him with a fait accompli . Or , as Tom Wicker put it in The New York ' limes , " a cup of hemlock . " Sen. Jacob K. Javits , floor spokesman for the New York delegation , knew that nothing could excuse New York 's refusing the opportunity to nominate one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from Cliff White advising him to deliver 92 votes for Lindsay . " Mr. Chairman , " Javits bawled through the din , New York is deeply honored to cast all its ninety-two votes for the son of which she is proudest -- the next President of the United States  --  John V. Lindsay ! " The next day the convention calmly nominated John Tower for Vice President . Just as Nixon had planned . At the Chicago Stockyards three weeks later Lyndon Johnson , his grin like creases in old leather , and Robert Kennedy . all teeth and hair and crown-prince romance . clasped arms and accepted the massed cheers of the faithful . Both had been nominated by acclamation . " America , " Johnson declared , " stands today on the threshold of a golden age . Only the weak and the timid will dare counsel retreat . " " President Johnson and I are going to win this election , " Kennedy said , " and move America ahead , ahead to the shining vision of our great President , John F. Kennedy . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section . " Johnson 's first appointment will be a food taster . " George Wallace , already campaigning hard , told a packed house in Philadelphia the next night , " I 'm here to give you something better to choose from than a tired old backroom dealer and two rich boys who would n't eat their oatmeal unless their mamma shoved it in on a golden spoon . " Meeting earlier at Indianapolis , Wallace 's American Independent Party had nominated Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina as his running mate . " Old Strom. " went the line attributed to Lyndon Johnson , " why , he 's bolted more often than an old maid 's door . " Johnson opened his campaign in Detroit on Labor Day . Lindsay chose Springfield , Ill . Speaking from the steps of Lincoln 's tan clapboard house on South Eighth Street , and borrowing his music from Abe , he called for " a new birth of freedom " in which America could " bind up the wounds of racial strife and create a great republic of brollictli ' o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivrrit not Illinois the day and girl himself all confused Abraham Lincoln , " Wallace told a rally iri New I haven . " Well . I can straighten them out for you . Lincoln 's the one who split rails , and all Johnny-boy 's ever split is a load of his daddy 's stock . " Out across the continent went the great jets packed with mimeograph machines , speech writers , reporters , recording equipment . sound technicians , crowd organizers , TV cameras , microphones , amplifiers , valets , whiskey , steaks , data books , secretaries , bodyguards , speaking lecterns , TelePrompTers , cosmeticians , court jesters , press agents and all the other paraphernalia needed to make a President in the electronic . jet-propelled , fast-sell , slick-asa-whistle , **26;2908;TOOLONG , medium-massaged , thermonuclear age .

Six miles beneath them the grandeur of America unfolded . unseen except in a moment 's glance at the porthole . A night flash of distant lightning over the Badlands . A glimpse of Mount Hood under the wing on the letdown into Portland . The stark grandeur of the Wasatch Range as the flaps came down for Salt Lake City . The ghostly desolation of Monument Valley . A presidential campaign allows no time for pondering the serene message of the land . The law of campaigning is the law of act and react , punch and counterpunch. thrust and parry , charge and deny . Instinct and animal stamina , and the ability to shut off the thinking mechanism when it threatens to break the savage tempo of the reflexes  --  these are the premium virtues . Lindsay 's campaign began harmoniously . Loyally , Reagan trouped California with him . Goldwater flew cross-country to join him on an Atlanta platform . ( A mistake . Lindsay 's speech was repeatedly interrupted by shouts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , brought trouble . The deals Nixon had made to engineer his nomination broke in the papers . Romney , the press reported , had been promised the Defense Department ; Everett Dirksen would get a veto over Lindsay 's choice for Secretary of Treasury ; Nixon himself would become Secretary of State ; Melvin Laird would fill the first vacancy on the Supreme Court . Democratic papers demanded the facts . Republican papers said it was only natural that commitments should have been made and that all of Lindsay 's  --  though some papers demurred on Laird  --  appeared to involve splendid statesmen . " I 'm not going to let you guys trap me into playing cabinet maker at this state of the campaign , " Lindsay told insistent reporters . " Tom Dewey . you recall . appointed his cabinet before the election twenty years ago , and a funny thing happened to him on the way to the cabinet meeting , " Lindsay 's embroilment in horse-trader politics was a break that John son desperately needed . Gallup showed him sis ! glints behind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeler-dealer " by dwelling urxm Lindsay 's " backroom deal " at Miami Beach .

Next day Johnson announcer that en route to Geneva he would confer in Paris with President de Gaulle . Next day he announced a journey to India to " press the global search for peace . " ' To the public Johnson seemed to have abandoned the sweaty political pit for the world stage of statesmanship , leaving Lindsay swatting at flies while the President shouldered the awesome burdens of state . Johnson 's meeting with de Gaulle was frigid . " What do you wish me to advise you upon ? " asked de Gaulle , like a headmaster to a dull-witted boy . Politically . however , it was offset by the illusion of harmony produced by the three-day meeting with Kosygin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in headlines . and Johnson 's TV report to the nation upon his return moved one of Lindsay 's best speeches ( " National honor is not imposed by bayonet . nor world respect by fear " ) off front pages of all but a few papers . Nixon flew to Boston to shore up Lindsay 's faltering campaign . " You 've got to hit him harder , " Nixon counseled . " Attack him directly . " Lindsay was a poor slasher , but in his genteel way he tried . Refocusing his campaign directly upon Johnson , he attacked Johnson 's credibility , charged that Johnson was a politician who had " repeatedly promised one thing and done the other . " " Johnson 's war , " he called it . " Johnson 's war , " he said , had debased the dollar . Johnson had brought American prestige to its lowest ebb in history . Johnson had filled Washington with tired men . Johnson had saddled America 's destiny to sterile policies . Johnson , Johnson , Johnson , and on and on he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . from platforms in Minneapolis . Saginaw , Pittsburgh , Paducah . Wichita , Indianapolis . Seattle .

I 'm tired , Mary , " fell across the bed and slept 15 hours . It was a long election night . As always , Connecticut came in first , giving eight electoral votes to Lindsay . The winner would need 270 . By 10 o'clock Lindsay had clearly carried New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and all New England except Massachusetts , which was voting its loyalty to the Kennedys , but his pluralities were perilously slender . And if he could not overpower Johnson in the Northeast where Johnson was weakest . his chances would fade when the Western vote came in .

At 9 o'clock the next morning California finally gave its 40 electoral votes to Lindsay by a mere 69,000-vote plurality . Wallace . drawing more than 10 percent of the vote from Lindsay , had almost handed the state of California to Johnson . With California in , the election of 1968 was over . For the first time since 1824 the people of the United States had failed to elect a President . Here is the final tabulation : Popular Vote Electoral Vote Lindsay 34,705,656 266 Johnson 34 , 301 , M 1 219 Wallace 5.318,020 53 Total 74,325,187 538 The Constitution 's 12th and 20th Amendments specify that if no man has an electoral majority , the newly elected House of Representatives shall choose the President from the three leaders in the popular voting . Only 50 votes are cast in the House . one by each state 's delegation . A majority , 26 delegations , is needed to elect a President . No President had been elected by the House since John Quincy Adams in 1824 . Hence , the men of 1969 were confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , certain facts were obvious . The majority of each state 's delegation would decide which candidate received its state 's single vote . And each congressman was free to vote as he pleased . In this most supreme of all party trials , this meant that virtually every congressman would vote his party loyalty . The notable exceptions were the congressmen from the six Wallace states , most of whom would have to stay with Wallace or risk punishment by their constituents . The House elected on November 5 was almost evenly split . Democrats held majorities on 25 delegations , Republicans on 24 . One state . Maryland , was split evenly with 4 Democrats and 4 Republicans . If party lines held , the first House ballot would give Lindsay 24 states , Johnson 19 and Wallace 6 . There would still be no President . To break the impasse and win , either Lindsay or Johnson would have to capture members of the opposing party .

Jealousies began to flare among loyal congressmen who saw vast prizes being offered for treachery . To 1101C1 the faithful , more and richer rewards harl to be pledged . By early December the Presidency was lying openly on the auction block , and American politics descended into a squalor that had not been seen since 1877 , when the robber barons and the South stole the election from Tilden in the deal to end Reconstruction . Most of the bartering proved to be self-canceling. however , so that by December 15 all counts still showed the impasse unbroken . At last , Johnson invited Wallace to the White House . Purled with victory . Wallace mistook a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnson had expected him to come high , but Wallace 's demands astonished him . Wallace wanted a pledge that Johnson would stop enforcing all civil-rights legislation enacted since 1957 . He demanded abolition of foreign economic aid and the anti-poverty program . He wanted deep cuts in federal support to welfare programs and , to frost the cake . severance of diplomatic relations with Moscow . He also wanted to be appointed Attorney General . They talked for two hours and parted coldly . Wallace returned to the White House on December 18 , December 29 and January 2 . There was no give in his demands . " When Johnson brings over some of Lindsay 's people and starts smelling a victory , he 'll come to me , " Wallace told a confidant . The House took the first ballot on January 6 . Lindsay polled 24 . Johnson 19 , Wallace 6 . Maryland , deadlocked , cast no vote . Through six ballots during the next three days the vote was unchanged . Johnson , however , had spent two weeks secretly working on Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NASA space installations through middle Dixie . On January 9 the deal was concluded , and next day , on the eighth House ballot , Arkansas , Georgia . Louisiana and South Carolina switched from Wallace to Johnson . Still Mississippi , hating Johnson even more than it loved federal gravy , and Alabama , loyal to Wallace , failed to budge . The deadlock remained : Lindsay 24 , Johnson 23 , Wallace 2 , Maryland not voting . Paralysis in the House , coupled with spreading public disgust at its squalid descent into courthouse politics , had produced a national anger seamed through with the mood of violence . Middle-class suburbanites who had once deplored peace and racial demonstrations now marched in protests against suspected attempts to steal the election for one candidate or another . Negroes feared that Johnson would betray them to Wallace . The campuses were in turmoil . The turbulence was aggravated by the political paranoids in whom the country iigimp led . Campus an:11 , and black III ( tqlkel to ( IIIHiru spired institutions saw a chance hir violent revolution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ls.lrayal . " The scared respectable people those citizens who saw Ike world as a web of terrifying conspiracies that were selling I hem out to Communists , criminals , military-industrial cartels , Negroes , unwed mothers , bankers or bureaucrats- - commingled with haters of every political hue . The Secret Service received a thousand threats a week against the lives of the three Presidential candidates and Robert Kennedy . One man was arrested in the lobby of Wallace 's hotel with two hand grenades in his overcoat pockets . The more aggressive elements of all these diverse political strains descended on Washington to make their muscle felt as the House deadlock persisted . Surly , spoiling for violence , they turned public-protest gatherings into dangerous rabble . The night of January 10 Wallace , in his Washington hotel suite , received alarming information . Maryland , he heard . had struck a deal with Johnson . So had Connecticut and Indiana , both of which would switch from Lindsay next day . The three would give Johnson 26 states and re-elect him . We now know that only Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Connecticut and Indiana . It was one of dozens of such rumors that filled Washington daily , but panicked perhaps by Maryland 's break , Wallace believed the whole story . Seeing his bargaining position about to crumple . Wallace acted with uncharacteristic rashness , Calling a news conference , he announced that he had concluded " an arrangement " with Johnson . As a result , he said , Mississippi and Alabama would cast the votes needed to elect Johnson next day . " What do you get from this arrangement , Governor ? " " I do n't regard the Presidency as something to be bargained for , " Wallace said , " but I would be very surprised if President Johnson does n't quit prosecuting these civil-rights laws quite so vigorously . " Wallace had wanted to keep Connecticut and Indiana from switching , but he underestimated the antagonism he could produce in the north . The prompt public outcry of anti-Wallace indignation was so furious that an alarmed Minnesota delegation announced next morning it would switch its vote that day from Johnson to Lindsay . Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of election . The awful prospect of a Republican victory so panicked the Mississippi and Alabama delegations that they caucused , voted to bolt Wallace at last and come in for Johnson , hoping to brake psychologically a possible shift to Lindsay . The result was still impasse . This time . with Maryland plus Wallace 's last two states voting for Johnson , and Minnesota switched to Lindsay , the vote was a 25-25 tie . By overplaying his hand . Wallace had eliminated himself as President-broker , and the House , frozen in paralytic deadlock , sank deeper and deeper into abject helplessness . By January 15 , when it was apparent that the House would not give the country a President by Inauguration Day , the Senate acted at last , The Consl , . , sence of an electoral majority for a Vice President . the Vice President shall he elected by majority vote of the Senate . The Senate had dutifully waited upon the House to name a Presideril until it was apparent that the House would not . By January 15 the Senate elders could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of Washington , " Everett Dirksen told the Senate . " Our parks and street corners are rancid with rabble-rousers preaching the heinous doctrine of violence . My brothers , it is time for the Senate to act . " It was inevitable , of course , that the Senate would elect Robert Kennedy Vice President if the House could not agree beforehand upon a President . It was a simple matter of party regularity . The Senate had 59 Democrats and only 41 Republicans . The Senate talked only one day . It voted on January 16 . Robert Kennedy received 58 votes . John Tower 40 . Senators Kennedy and Tower did not participate in the voting . " If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term . " the 20th Amendment states , " then the Vice President-elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified . " " As in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President . " the 12th Amendment adds . Thus . as Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy the White House  --  temporarily at least  --  at noon on January 20 . This bizarre constitutional solution outraged the mob elements that hated Kennedy and Johnson . Beaten in both the popular and electoral vote . they preached , the Democrats were conducting " a back-door steal of the White House . " Mob passion had now displaced political dissent . Those who marched through the snow the night before Inauguration Day threatening to lire the Capitol were no longer the pillars of community and campus but a marauding gang of desperate angry vigilantes serving the law of muscle and gun . At the Capitol Plaza they were met by several thousand more  --  men who had come to tight for the Democrats , bitterly frustrated men eager for violence in any case , and the fractious young come to fight for one principle or another , or simply to join the fun . In the ultimate act of lunacy , this motley assembly somehow coalesced into a single mob with its fury directed upon the House of Representatives . Police estimated that nearly 10.000 persons took part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House wing of the Capitol and nearly broke the military defense line . Except for the storm . which held down the mob 's size , the Capitol might have been gutted . Robert Kennedy had sat in the White House as acting President only three days when he reached a decision . It can not have been easy for him . Arthur Schlesinger Jr , . his biographer . later wrote that he was so alarmed about the governmental crisis that he first considered using his new power to switch House votes to the Republicans . elect Lindsay and create a coalition government . There were persuasive arguments against this , among them the sacrifice of his own ambitions . Using the presidential power to switch ( he election in the House to Johnson 1.1as the obvious alternative , but it involvod great risks . Johnson , atter had been beaten by Lindsay in both Ilse popular and electoral vote . Swinging the necessary I louse votes would be extremely costly to the natant. worst of all , there was the risk that this ulti ? mate deal for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government in the United States might be perma-nently damaged . In the end he decided that the only solution lay within the letter of the Constitution . By chance Lyndon Johnson , now a private citizen , had asked for a conference on January 23 . The two greeted each other cautiously . " Mr. Vice President , " Johnson began , " I 've been talking to Hubert Humphrey about the farm-subsidy plan and " I 'm the President now . " Kennedy interrupted . Johnson stopped in mid-sentence , squinted , ran his tongue over his thin upper lip , then tried his grin . " Mr. President , " he began again . " Hubert 's pretty certain that  --  " " I talked with Hubert this morning , " Kennedy interrupted . " I 'm not going to propose a new farm plan in the State of the Union message . It would cost the Treasury a billion dollars and raise food prices three percent by June . " Johnson sprawled far back in his chair and pinched his nose . " The State of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an earlobe and looked thoughtfully through his old office window at the Washington Monument . At last , " That farm plan will swing Minnesota back from Lindsay and give us the twenty-six votes we need to get elected right , " Johnson said . He was probing . " In my judgment it would be a betrayal of the people , " Kennedy said . " The country wo n't tolerate any more deals in the House . and I do n't intend to begin " ? he paused ? " to begin my Administration with a deal that ? " " Your Administration ! " Johnson 's voice was a hoarse whisper . " I am the only President the country has . I have made a determination that someone must begin to govern . I am the only person constitutionally qualified to do so . " " The House elects the President ! " Johnson 's big fist pounded on the desk . " And the House still has to act ! " " The Ilouse is unable to act , ? Kennedy said , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to put the ma-chinery of govei Timm hack in action . " Johnsi in relaxed and smiled . conciliatory now . " The way to do that . " lie said , " is to go ahead on the new farm plan . bring Minnesota over and get the election behind us . Of course , if you want to deliver a State of the Union message first , we can gel the speech-writers and " Kennedy shook his head . " No. " he said . ( " When I told him , " Kennedy would later tell Iriends , " he gulped . " ) " Why do n't you just tell it to me without any ruffles on it , son , " Johnson said , " What is it you think you 're going to do ? " " I intend to govern . Tomorrow I will ask the House to suspend balloting for President and recess until I can appear before a joint session next week with the State of the Union message . " " It 's unconstitutional . The Constitution says the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President is elected . " " The Constitution makes no reference to continuous balloting . That 's merely a rule of the House . I am advised that a resolution to lay the matter aside so that the work of the country can proceed will be in order . " " There 's absolutely no precedent for that . " Johnson said . " We will make a precedent . " " And once they put it aside . " Johnson said , " just when do you think they 'd ever take it up again ? " " I really ca n't say , " Kennedy replied . " Possibly never . " " You know damn well never . " Johnson said . Kennedy later said he had expected him to shout and storm , but Johnson 's voice , he said . remained " as cold as a tombstone . " Johnson seemed about to protest again , but instead clamped his lips together and stood . tall and proud , glaring down at his successor with no sign of emotion . Kennedy did not rise as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob , Johnson turned . " Your brother . " he said . " was a man . " The door closed behind him . Kennedy lifted the phone . " Ethel , " he said , " we 're moving into the White House . " Replacing the phone , he swiveled the big chair and gazed out toward the Washington Monument . It was snowing again . The old office , as always , was full of ghosts , but he was not a man to sense them . ?
