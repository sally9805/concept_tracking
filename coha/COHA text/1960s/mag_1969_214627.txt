It was only last fall that an improbable little part-island , part-mainland Spanish territory in Africa won its independence and sidled into the world 's consciousness as the 126th member of the United Nations . The omens could not have been brighter . Spanish U.N . Ambassador Don Jaime de Pinies applauded " the splendid example of peaceful independence " set by tiny Equatorial Guinea , and in return the nation 's U.N . ambassador , Saturnine Ibongo lyanga , said his countrymen hoped to be " an Iberian bridge to Africa . " All differences seemed ironed out between the 60,000 Fangs of underdeveloped Rio Muni , the mainland wing , and the 8,000 Bubis of the prosperous island of Fernando Poo . Francisco Macias Nguema , 45 , was elected President , and his fellow Fang , cosmopolitan Atanasio Ndongo , 41 , became Foreign Minister . Then , unhappily , the Fangs fell out . <P> Macias , a sleepy-eyed , impetuous demagogue , noted that Spanish officials in Bata , the capital , had had the temerity to fly three Spanish flags over official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent his personal guard to haul one flag down . When the Spanish ambassador dropped by to discuss the matter , Macias ordered him out of his office and cabled Madrid to demand that he be recalled . A few days later , Foreign Minister Ndongo and U.N . Ambassador Ibongo ( also a Fang ) arrived in Bata and the situation deteriorated still further . <P> Ndongo tried to mount a golpe ( coup ) against Macias , who , at the time , was out of town delivering a series of tirades against Spanish " exploiters . " Well aware that without Spanish financial aid ( which runs to nearly $8,000,000 a year ) , Equatorial Guinea would find itself in serious difficulty , Ndongo moved into the President 's office , after doing his best to assure himself of military support . The assurances proved illusory . As Macias now tells it , Ndongo became so frightened when Macias returned that he leaped from the office 's window and broke a leg . Ibongo , also in the office , was arrested . The coup , without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , combined with Macias ' increasingly anti-Spanish attitude , was enough to persuade more than 2,000 Spaniards to flee the country . According to Macias , Ibongo poisoned himself in prison , though some Spaniards maintain he was beaten to death in his cell . Spokesmen for Macias said Ndongo was being treated in a Bata hospital . The 260-man Spanish garrison still remains . Macias , after first ordering them to leave , seems to trust his own troops no longer .
