Students in Training The Hotel and Catering Department of Hendon College of Technology in North West London offers all main courses previously mentioned and I went to see students at work . When I arrived in the large kitchens , they were busy serving up luncheons for the restaurant used by visitors and lecturers in all departments of this vast college , one student acting as aboyeur and calling out orders as received over the service counter . Students looked very business-like in their white coats and aprons , the boys wearing tall chef caps and the girls round cooks ' caps . They were working quickly , carefully and methodically but there was no sense of dash and flurry as orders came through . When you actually work in a big kitchen humming with activity , you come to realise that while everybody is hurrying , no one is in a panic , ' a young man student told me . He spoke from experience , having worked already in a firstclass hotel kitchen as part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-year sandwich ' course , students spending seven months of the year in college and five months in hotels , where they work in kitchens , restaurant and // reception for the first , second and third year respectively . In the fourth practical period , boys do bar and cellar work and girls work on the housekeeping side . The young man student to whom I was talking had chosen hotel work because he liked getting to know people , and he made it clear that the people he most enjoyed meeting were among the fraternity of chefs . There is , it seems , a cameraderie of the kitchen and the inexhaustible techniques of highly skilled cookery provide a bond of mutual interest . I liked cooking even as a small boy , ' this young man told me . You could not make a success of it if you were not in love with your work . ' Students ' time in college is divided between cookery demonstrations , cookery practice and lectures . The chefs ' and cooks ' course includes the study of catering commodities such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , and kitchen hygiene deals with such matters as seeing that your working space and floor space are clean and your pans and utensils properly cleansed . Students learn numbers of recipes , from basic sauces the gastronomic specialities of the celebrated French chef Escoffier . There are over a hundred potato dishes alone and students are expected to know at least fifteen of them thoroughly . They learn the art of carving and kitchen knife manipulation . The professional carver uses the full twelve inches of the carving knife with a free easy movement of hand and wrist and a skilled chef can turn ' a potato to the required shape in a matter of seconds . I wondered which of those keen young students would reach top chef or cook positions one day . Their instructor , himself a former head chef , gave me the essentials for advancement . The fiery , hot-tempered , temperamental chef de cuisine is mainly a myth , ' he said . To control a large kitchen you need an even temperament , patience , a vast knowledge of food markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own and other people 's work . You and they must work at speed to ensure punctuality . The mise en place is of supreme importance and that means // thinking ahead for yourself and your assistants . Obviously you must have the requisite high skills . Every skilled chef is a master craftsman in his own right . ' I lunched in the restaurant , where students act as waiters and waitresses , working under the direction of an instructor restaurant manager . The waiter who served us was asked to describe dishes on a varied menu , although I did not need much explanation to enjoy a delicious steak-andkidney pudding . Waiters and waitresses practise silver service , the art of transferring food from a dish to the diner 's plate by holding spoon and fork between the fingers . This is by no means so easy as it looks and they must learn , also , how to carry a dish with the fingers spread out beneath it , concealing both fingers and the protecting napkin if the dish is hot . They are taught all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , removing dishes speedily and changing ashtrays whenever necessary . They learn two methods of serving . In the English style , food is served from the left and plates removed from the right . In Continental style , they serve and take away from the left . Drinks , including coffee , are poured always from the right . Students learn the correct way to set covers ( lay tables ) and from time to time they set a large festive table when parties of visitors are entertained . I asked the Head of the Hotel Department if she would tell me how stiff the National Diploma examinations are . ( Yes , the Head of this hotel school is a woman but men are in the majority among her well-qualified lecturing staff . ) She said National Diploma students took thirteen examinations over a period of ten days , in cookery , restaurant practice and the other subjects in the curriculum . Success does not depend entirely on examination results for we have a system of marking which records the student 's progress throughout the whole training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means that a boy or girl who is afflicted with examination nerves may catch up to or over the required percentage on marks for good progress reckoned from the first term of entry to college . // Steady , painstaking work is just as important as examination brilliance . ' Waiters presented bills exactly as they would do in a real restaurant and a girl student was at work as restaurant cashier . I visited the receptionist and book-keeping department , where students learn manual and machine tabular book-keeping and control-clerk work , and study the complexities of booking charts . French and English , with speech training , are important subjects and students attend lectures on current affairs , with an accent on tourism in view of the need for helping hotel visitors , especially overseas visitors , in their requests for information . I asked four National Diploma students to tell me why they had chosen an hotel career . Two girl students and one young man answered without hesitation that they thought hotel life would satisfy their interest in people and human nature . The fourth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel industry held prospects of many new developments . This young man was thinking of his own country especially but he had touched upon the vital purpose of college education in the hotel industry . Hotels are up against constant criticism from the public whose needs they serve so closely . These young college students , as they progress in their careers , may find themselves in places where they may meet hidebound tradition . We have always done it like this and intend to go on doing so , ' is an assertion they may have to counter . Theirs to make improvements , as their good basic knowledge develops with experience and they rise to organising positions . Good hotel keeping is a major factor in attracting visitors from other countries , and every visitor from abroad brings money into our country , of vital importance to the nation 's economy . Working in a First-Class Hotel Wishing to see a first-class hotel in active operation , I visited the Piccadilly Hotel , in the heart of London 's West // End . The Piccadilly is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels in London and associated with other hotels , including eight in Scotland . My first impression of the hotel was of smooth , easy service , staff alert and courteous , no guest kept waiting an unnecessary moment . Here , they use the word guest ' for people actually staying in the hotel and the word client ' for those who come in for meals or drinks only . The solid core of their clientele is drawn from business and professional men and women from home and abroad , sometimes including embassy officials . I watched receptionists making minute to minute alterations on the large board which indicated the exact state of occupancy of the 225 bedrooms . Four receptionists coped with a number of desk telephones and the reception manager answered personal booking enquiries and received new arrivals , with porters and pages in attendance to escort them into the lift , carry their cases and take them to their rooms . Departing guests received their bills in the cashier 's department at another side of the foyer and I saw the girls operating accounting machines as chits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from different departments . In the Piccadilly Hotel , as in some large London hotels , girls do not work at the reception counter . The Personnel Manager told me that the situation is changing and more girl receptionists are to be found in hotels where hitherto it was unknown for a woman to be seen at work in the foyer . Grand Metropolitan Hotels employ girl receptionists in many of their other hotels . They find them steady and conscientious in their work and many people like to be welcomed by an understanding woman . In smaller hotels , girl receptionists are nearly always employed . I was entertained to lunch in the restaurant where Mario , the restaurant manager , told me that hotel work grows on you and there is a particular pleasure in greeting regular clients even if you have not seen them for years . The entrance to a good restaurant is never left unattended and // if the restaurant manager is engaged , the head waiter takes his place and leads newcomers to their table . I was told some of the finer points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commis waiters rush up with clean linen , covers are reset quickly and the mishap is treated smoothly and speedily as if it were one of the pleasures of good service , as indeed it is . I asked what the hours were at the Piccadilly and the Personnel Manager told me staff work forty-eight hours in the week , on varying shifts , many with a four-hour break , usually in the afternoon . Here , receptionists alternate between morning and evening shifts , eight a.m. to four p.m. , or three-thirty p.m. to eleven p.m . Restaurant and kitchen staff work approximately from ten-thirty a.m. to three p.m. and from six p.m. until ten p.m. and this , in hotel language is known as the spread over ' . The week averages five and a half days , which means that staff have three days off in a fortnight , with one free day in one week and a two-day week-end the next week . The head housekeeper at the Piccadilly Hotel has several assistant housekeepers , a number of chambermaids and a cleaning staff working under her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , mostly with private bathrooms . She liked her job because she was always busy and there was no hanging about . Two waiters working in the floor service told me that on receipt of guests ' telephoned orders , they take breakfast trays along to the bedrooms with utmost promptitude . Americans have the very highest notions of hotel service , they said . The assistant manager paused to have a word with me . He said he did constant tours of inspection . Like all in management , his concern is to see that everyone is on his toes and everything going just as it should be , and to go to the rescue if an unexpected hitch occurs . Grand Metropolitan Hotels give college students on sandwich ' courses their practical experience and they have their own management training scheme , open to all promising candidates as well as college-trained applicants . They // encourage trainees to ask questions and to show initiative . All staff have good meals and changing rooms and they have a hostel for those whose homes are away from London . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incentive bonus on good business and payment for any business a member of the staff may introduce personally . The Company likes to consider suggestions for improvement made by employees . When a suggestion is approved , the prize awarded may be a book token or a box of chocolates , a five pound note or considerably more , according to the value of the idea put forward . An Hotel Housekeeper at Work At the Hotel New Ambassadors in West Central London , I had a talk with the head housekeeper , a competent young woman who described how she trained chambermaids to look after the 140 bedrooms and suites which are in her charge . Every housekeeper has her own pet foibles in bedmaking and I insist upon a marginal top sheet turn-under which gives a neat appearance when the bed is turned down , ' she said . We make handkerchief corners because our bedcovers are closely fitting . ' When turning down beds , chambermaids are taught to arrange pyjamas correctly and set out nightdresses with the waist pinched and the skirt spread out attractively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lucky in having built-in furniture which did not have to be moved , and drawers have an inside finish which can be sponged over , so that troublesome paper linings are not needed . Double glazed windows help to prevent dust as well as noise in these air-conditioned rooms , but the housekeeper sees that every room is kept spick and shining and thoroughly cleaned throughout . She trains her chambermaids to handle visitors ' possessions with discretion and to gauge individual needs for assistance . A garment left lying about is hung up and anything found on the floor is placed in clear view on a table , otherwise // visitors ' possessions are left in their own arrangements ? some people are happiest with their things well scattered about them . Chambermaids have to seize the opportune moment for doing ' the room , as best suits the visitor 's convenience . Should a visitor not appear before noon , nor telephone a breakfast order , the housekeeper herself rings through to his room to enquire if all is well , even if a Do not disturb ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call a doctor in case of illness and she takes all minor responsibilities on her own shoulders and tries not to trouble the general manager with anything but a serious emergency . Much of her time is spent on rounds of inspection , seeing that stewardesses keep up requisite stocks of linen in their corridor cupboards , seeing each room is in perfect order , properly supplied with face towels and bath towels , soap , coat-hangers and ashtrays . She shook her head when I asked if she herself carried a duster to add finishing touches . If a stewardess did leave a windowsill undusted , flecks of powder on the dressing-table or a high water line in a private bathroom , then I should call her back to put matters right , even if I could do it myself in half the time , ' she told me . This housekeeper is happy in her work . She says she was born with a natural instinct for seeing that a room is shining and beautiful , and tended to perfection . It is a major essential in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of unusual , colourful design . Waitresses wear orange-coloured dresses , wine waiters have claret-coloured jackets and those of the hall porters are in a rich emerald green . Junior porters wear smart tunics and trousers in black and peacock blue . Besides banqueting rooms , the New Ambassadors has five smaller private party rooms in a wing facing Woburn Walk , an enchanting Regency terrace . One of these rooms is a literary shrine , for it was in the actual home of the poet W. B. Yeats from 1895 to 1919 . On the advice of John Masefield , Poet Laureate , the room has been furnished exactly as it was in Yeats ' time ? lamps , chairs and tables , // period wallpaper , golden brown sofa and curtains , with a fine photographic portrait and copies of Yeats ' works . The original small black double-sided grate still remains . It was around that fireplace that poets , artists and dramatists gathered , Masefield among them , when Yeats held his famous Monday evenings ' at the turn of the century . Staff are proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Hotels Staff employed in the well-known Trust House Hotels may find themselves working in houses with a history , too , for among over two hundred hotels in Great Britain and Ireland , they own famous old inns such as the Feathers at Ledbury , the Lion at Shrewsbury and the Angel and Royal Hotel at Grantham , where visitors include a cross section of the county community as well as travellers . Staff might wait on county landowners or farming people , local solicitors with their clients , or parents entertaining children from boarding schools in the vicinity . Many other Trust House Hotels are in fine modern buildings , including three motoring hotels in the country , where staff work unbroken shifts to give continuous restaurant service . In St George 's Hotel , the hotel of the sky ' in London , receptionists , chefs and waiters work high up on the fourteenth floor , with views extending over Broadcasting House and the busy West End shopping streets . Girl receptionists are employed at the counter . As well as accepting their quota of apprentices under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their own training schemes . Courses for cooks , waiters , waitresses and receptionists are organised on a sandwich ' basis , partly in hotels , partly at technical colleges . Cooks ' courses last two years , waiters ' and waitresses courses last twelve months . Age of entry is from fifteen to seventeen years and boys and girls from secondary modern schools may be accepted . Receptionist Book-Keeper courses last twelve months , // the first six months being spent in college where students work for Trust Houses ' own certificate in book-keeping and reception . The second period is spent in hotels , usually working under a senior receptionist . Age of entry is from sixteen years upwards and applicants are expected to have attained G.C.E. standard in English and Mathematics or Arithmetic . Boys and girls aged from about fifteen to seventeen years with at least four G.C.E. 0-level passes may be given indentured General Trainee Apprenticeship for a five-year training in all hotel departments . On completion , trainees are considered for positions as assistant manager or general assistant . Trust House Hotels offer employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any college course in hotel management . After four years of such employment , they are considered for positions as assistant manager , general assistant or , should they be married , for joint management . Even if a married couple have had no previous training , they may be accepted for an eighteen-month joint management training . The age of entry is up to forty-five for both husband and wife . No specified educational qualifications are stipulated and they are chosen mainly for personal qualities . They must be able to deal tactfully and charmingly with all kinds of people and to keep a loyal staff . Hotel technique can be learned by training , but the right personality must be inborn . Married couples with children must arrange for someone else , perhaps a relative , to look after them during the eighteen-month training . When they are appointed as managers , a house or rooms in the hotel will be provided , and they can have their children with them . Incidentally , Trust House Hotels do their best to provide good accommodation for all resident staff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the reception office staff have a nearby cottage to themselves , with pleasant bedrooms , a sitting-room with TV and a kitchen where they can make their own snacks and cups of tea in off-duty hours . Sole management trainees are selected from universities , // hotel schools and from those who have trained with Trust House Hotels in general management in the ways already described . Their training includes experience in an hotel on the Continent . It is unusual for a woman to be appointed sole manager of a Trust House Hotel but it is interesting to note that a woman is in sole charge of their large Wessex Hotel , not long since opened in Winchester . To make a beginning with a large hotel group such as Trust House Hotels may mean that your career is fixed and safeguarded for the rest of your working life , and yet with the possibility of moving to hotels in different parts of the country . Whenever possible , although no guarantee can be given , Trust House Hotels try to place young people in hotels not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smaller Hotel I visited other smaller hotels , not in the large combine groups . The Manageress of an hotel in a beauty spot in the Midlands told me how she enjoyed the personal element in her work . However busy she may be , she never fails to shake hands with departing visitors and to wave them off from the doorway . Our clientele has been built up by recommendations , not advertisements , ' she said . If you send people away happy , they will come back again , or tell their friends . ' This hotel has no separate banqueting rooms yet they cater for many weddings , which may mean adapting main lounge and dining-room for the reception , especially when there is a sit-down wedding breakfast . The Manageress may have to explain to visitors staying in the hotel that their lunch will be served at an earlier hour than usual , perhaps in a different room or a screened-off section . In making her explanation , she is careful to show that she is concerned for her visitors ' comfort and they rarely object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding party arriving . The Manageress herself is the first person in the hotel to receive and congratulate the bridal couple . // I can not count the many brides I have welcomed , ' this manageress told me . Wedding receptions need careful planning and you must have your staff ready to give their very best . We all share in the happiness ! ' Later on , I talked to a girl receptionist who works with one assistant only in another hotel of moderate size . Between them they manage the whole job ? bookings , bills , correspondence , notifications to housekeeper , assisting visitors . In this hotel there is a fair number of permanent residents , mostly elderly , and they like a little attention from the receptionist . She works out P.A.Y.E. , too , and enjoys filling pay packets and handing them out to the staff . This receptionist lives in and takes her meals in the hotel dining-room . She pointed out the advantages of a position where you do not have to travel to and from work , especially in bad weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere , felt by visitors and staff alike . We have a wonderful manageress and we all pull together under her lead , ' she concluded . Her words could be applied to every hotel , whatever its size . It is the manager or manageress who sets the tone of the establishment . Skilful organisation plus personality are the secrets of success . Finally , I talked to a young woman who tackles the cooking for a small , twenty-bedroomed hotel in a seaside town . She produces three meals a day ? breakfast , lunch at one o'clock , dinner at seven . A kitchen man prepares vegetables and waits on her generally and the proprietress relieves her on off-duty days and helps with the catering . We order by telephone , ' she told me . I should prefer to shop personally but there is n't time . The proprietress and I plan menus together . ' This cook works hard but she likes the independence of her position . She likes being mistress of her kitchen and organising her own job . She likes the respect with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really likes cooking . She learned her skills in college but she has the natural gift , too // Continental Experience The British Hotels and Restaurants Association is the organisation officially appointed by the Ministry of Labour to arrange temporary employment abroad for students in the hotel and restaurant industry by means of exchange and quota agreements . Students are sent to most countries in Western Europe , including Belgium , France , Germany , Holland , Italy , Scandinavia and Switzerland . Both young men and girls may apply . Ordinarily they are not accepted under the age of seventeen and must not be over thirty . They must have had at least one year 's hotel or restaurant experience , or one year 's training at a recognised hotel school , and must have a recommendation from employer or college . Young men work as junior waiters ; girls must do whatever work is required of them , waitress or chambermaid work , or general assistance . Students are not employed as receptionists as a rule , since they lack the extensive command of foreign languages required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of the country in which they hope to be employed . They are paid according to normal rates of pay in the country concerned ; meals are usually provided , often with residence , but students in some hotels may have to live out . Engagements are usually arranged in the Spring for work at the beginning of the Summer season . They may be for any period up to twelve months , with a possible extension for a further six months , but most students go only for six months or a year . There are few opportunities for those wishing to go abroad in June or July to work for a few weeks only , unless an exchange is arranged between training colleges . The experience of working abroad can be useful , according to what you put into it . It may not be an easy , entirely pleasant experience , however , and you must expect to work longer hours than are usual in Great Britain . The opportunity will give you a chance to become fluent in the language of the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to you later on if , back home again in Great Britain , acquaintanceships made abroad should bring foreign visitors , perhaps even an entire conference , to the hotel where you are working , on your especial recommenda-tion . Applications should be made to : The British Hotels and Restaurants Association , 88 Brook Street , London W.I. Hotel Salaries and Prospects Salaries vary considerably and many employers pay salaries which are higher than the minimum rates of pay laid down by Wages Councils . Approximate salaries for experienced staff in London have been estimated as follows : Managers and Manageresses : from ? boo or ? 700 up to ? 2,500 or ? 3,000 a year . Assistant Managers and Assistant Manageresses : from ? 500 to ? 700 a year . General Assistants : from ? 5 to ? IO or ? I2 weekly . Head Housekeepers : from ? I o or Liz up to L18 weekly . Chambermaids : from ? 8 to ? 12 weekly . Control Managers and Control Clerks : from ? g weekly to ? 1,000 a year . Reception Managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Receptionists : from L8 to ? 15 weekly . Chefs de Cuisine : from /'I , 000 to ' 2,500 a year . Chefs de Partie : from ? 16 to ? 25 or ? 3o weekly . Cooks : from ? 8 to ? 12 weekly and upwards . Restaurant Managers : from ? 15 to ? 30 weekly . Waiters : from ? 7 to ? 15 weekly . Waitresses : from L7 weekly , upwards . It must be emphasised that the above salaries are quoted approximately . They are given only as an indication of the pay in different London hotels and they do not represent a scale of promotion . The preceding figures refer to non-resident positions , except in the case of manager or manageress , general assis-tant or housekeeper . When any of the other positions mentioned are resident , the salary is likely to be from ? 2 // to L3 less , weekly . Thus a receptionist who lived in might earn from ' 6 to ? 13 , for example . Salaries in the provinces are usually about ten per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service charge to clients and visitors , it may be divided among the staff or , if the service charge is not divided among the staff ; their salaries are fixed accordingly . Waiters , waitresses and chambermaids often receive tips which may be additional to the service charge . In some hotels there is the tronc system , through which all tips are pooled and divided . Young men and girls who aim at management positions should realise that exceptional ability is required to reach the top and there is much competition for principal vacancies . As a college tutor said to his students at the close of their final term , You can not all be managers . There are more positions on the rise of the hill . ' - Finding Tour job : Vacancies are advertised in the hotel journal Caterer and Hotelkeeper , and applications can be made also to the Manager of any hotel or to the personnel manager of any group of hotels . Applications to the group hotels mentioned in this chapter may be addressed to : The Personnel Manager , Grand Metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Personnel Officer , Trust House Services Ltd , 53 Shorts Gardens , Drury Lane , London W.C.2 . Boys and girls seeking apprenticeship or learner vacancies can apply direct to hotels or through their local youth employment officer . Many juniors obtain their first positions through their colleges . // RESTAURANT CATERING THERE are all kinds of restaurants ? the large or small expensive restaurant employing male chefs and waiters , the good-class more popular-priced restaurant of any size , the small home cooking ' type of restaurant and the many hundreds of self-service cafeterias , often belonging to large catering firms with multiple branches . - Type of Work : All these restaurants provide openings for the young man or woman who wants a position of management , or to become a chef or cook . If you work on the front ' side of a restaurant , you see an ever-changing cross-section of humanity . You see people relaxing , you see friends meeting , you see family parties and you see romance . Nowadays people eat out more than they used to do , not always for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to that enjoyment , even if you work in the kitchens and never set eyes upon the customers . In some positions you may have to work early or late , perhaps starting at seven o'clock in the morning or finishing as late as midnight . Probably this would be on a shift system so that if you start early , you get away early , and if you finish late , you start late , too . You may work on Saturdays or Sundays , taking off-duty days during the week . You might have to work on bank holidays , too . In most positions , you will have free meals but you will eat at unusual times . Since everyone has to be working during busy luncheon hours , you may find yourself eating your main meal at about ten-thirty or eleven o'clock in the morning or two-thirty in the afternoon . And it is hard work and you will be on your feet much of the time . - Personal Qualities , Necessary : For cooks , a real liking for 77 // cookery , deft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability for kitchen calculations , and powers of organisation for those who take charge . Artistic ability is helpful in food decoration and arrangement . Taste buds ' , the term describing instant recognition of quality and flavouring in food , may be natural or acquired through experience . For management , the gift for organisation must be highly developed , also the power of acute observation . Business acumen is of the greatest importance in buying and menuplanning and in understanding how to attract customers . - Qualifications and Training : College courses which include cooking and restaurant operation are suitable ( see pages 57 to 65 ) . Young men and girls with diplomas or certificates are at an advantage in seeking training for management positions but those without college qualifications sometimes work their way upwards . Take the giant firm of J. Lyons and Company Ltd , for instance , with their many teashops in London and provincial towns , including Birmingham , Shrewsbury , Wolverhampton , Hull and Leeds , their specialty restaurants , some of which are in their large London Corner Houses , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chelsea Flower Show and the royal garden parties at Buckingham Palace . Lyons draw trainee teashop manageresses from girls and women aged from eighteen to about forty , with or without previous college training . They have a rather longer manageress training scheme for girls aged from sixteen to eighteen , usually chosen from grammar school leavers , although a girl from a secondary modern school may be selected . These younger girls attend technical college one day a week , their studies including the business side of running a large catering organisation . Teashops are known in the firm as white and golds ' , because the name on the front of most of Lyons ' teashops still has the characteristic gold on white lettering which was familiar to Londoners in late Victorian and Edwardian days . Nowadays they are up-to-date self service cafeterias // with a retail department or counter selling cakes , pastries , bread , ice-cream , frozen foods and groceries . Trainee assistant manageresses are chosen especially for personality . Lyons look for the applicant who seems likely to develop into a practical business woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactfully with customers and keep staff working happily under her control . They prefer to engage trainee assistant manageresses who have not less than two 0-level G.C.E. passes but others with education up to a similar standard may be accepted . Good English is important , and candidates are given intelligence tests . In the Corner Houses , the majority of management trainees are chosen from young men and women who have had college training in catering , entry age usually from about eighteen and a half to nineteen years . A very keen untrained beginner may rise from the ranks . Main positions , under overall control of a House Manager and his assistants , are as follows : Group Managers and Deputy Group Managers take charge of two or possibly three restaurants . ( A Corner House may have several different style restaurants on the same floor . ) In each restaurant , eight or ten Assistant Restaurant Managers are employed . They are concerned with customer reception and seating , waitress supervision , service offood , kitchen work and day-to-day running , including staff duty rotas , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience are selected for London Steak Houses . Some transfers from Corner Houses take place , and between Corner Houses , Specialty Restaurants and Teashops . All these positions , except those in Steak Houses , may be filled by men or women . Male chefs and cooks are employed in main production kitchens and as grill cooks in Specialty restaurants , where cooking is done on the spot within view of the customer . Trainee manageresses in teashops work their way through the back and front of the house . They learn how to make attractive displays at dispensing counters , including those for salads and cold dishes . They take their turns at tea and coffee making , at the cash desk and at the retail counter , which may be run on serve-yourself lines like a supermarket So CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE store . Helped by courses at the central training school , they learn how to tackle figures and order stores , and the business side of management . At Corner Houses , training for management is on a larger scale and trainees progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Salad Bowl ' fixed price luncheon to that of a first-class restaurant with silver service . Duty in a Wimpy bar is considered especially valuable because you help to prepare food , serve the customer and take the money , and it teaches you speed of operation . Length of training varies according to age , skill and personal progress but it is not likely to be less than thirty-six weeks . Working in a Restaurant I was privileged to be taken round the famous Corner House in Coventry Street near Piccadilly Circus where I learned some of the points an assistant manager has to watch out for . Gateaux , for example , are made freshly every day and the assistant manager has to gauge exactly what quantity to order so as to have sufficient in hand and yet avoid waste stock , a docket for which would be seen by the group manager . When ordering supplies , assistant managers must remember the day of the week . Saturdays are busy and throughout the summer season there are crowds of holiday visitors . Ability to speak a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a member of the staff can speak French , German , Spanish , or another foreign language so that he or she could be called upon in unusual circumstances if need for explanations to a foreign customer should arise . Assistant managers teach dispensing assistants to work with method . Hors d'oeuvres have to be replenished constantly and even the apparently simple matter of ladling out portions of fruit salad has its complications . If a too liberal assistant puts in nothing but peaches and cherries , a bowl half full of apple will be left and that , too , is waste . Managers can not watch everyone every minute and they // try to influence assistants to work with conscientiousness . Success proves the assistant manager 's ability to take charge . I was curious to know what chances there were of working in Out Door Catering , known familiarly in Lyons as O.D.C. , but actually a separate company called Town and Country Catering . I was told that the only chance of joining came by special selection , first for single occasions such as a wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have Mr or Miss So-and-so . ' If the chosen ones shine , their services may be requested a second time . Star ' waitresses are among the first selected . They win their star by examination results after a special two-week training course held annually in January . Afterwards , I went along to talk to the Manageress of a busy Lyons teashop near Oxford Circus . She told me that she or one of her three assistant manageresses comes on duty well before seven o'clock in the morning to superintend preparations for breakfast customers . This means everything from seeing that the porter lights up grills , steamers and hot-water boilers to preparing and setting out the food and seeing tables are clean and properly equipped with sugar and cruet . Sugars are replenished every two hours and in between when necessary , ' the Manageress told me , going on to describe the queue that formed outside before the teashop opened at seven-thirty a.m . The peak inflow of customers is round about eight-thirty , most of them workers on their way to shops and offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manageress sees to the business side ? staff rota , wage sheets , checking cash floats and banking . Supplies are ordered two days in advance , groceries once weekly and ingredients for salads daily . I have to order extra in school holidays as many parents bring their children here , ' she told me . Of course I stock up for special events such as Cup Finals , which bring in crowds of customers . ' Staff have their own meals and then everything is geared up for lunchtime service , beginning at midday . Manageress and assistant manageresses share controls , one in the kitchen , F // one at service counter , one on the floor ' , that is , where customers sit . The essential in cafeteria service is to keep customers moving in a continuous flow . We aim to have five trays passing the cashier in one minute but we do n't as a rule get more than four trays through in the sixty seconds , ' she said . If ever there is a hitch in the service , I step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed a chat with customers . It 's important to learn their likes and dislikes , especially when a new item comes on the menu . Trainee manageresses come to her well primed with methods in theory , after an induction course . She teaches them practicalities . Some girls pick things up instantly , some are slower , but plodders may do just as well in the end . Manageresses provide their own dresses , chosen to their own style and colour . Black wins every time in my opinion , ' said this particular manageress , who stands well and told me she never suffered from aching feet and rarely felt fatigue . Incidentally , Lyons ' employees enjoy a social club at Sudbury , for those who like to keep fit by sports and dancing . And there are fifty good London landladies who provide accommodation for women employees whose homes are in the provinces . Lyons have a hostel , also , where girls under eighteen must live when away from home . My manageress said she took a personal interest in all her staff . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately if she can not keep bright and smiling on wet days when customers may not flow in , as well as on fine days when the cash register clicks continually . Good takings mean much to the young , up-and-coming manageress for if her teashop is successful , then she is on the way to promotion , perhaps to a large teashop or specialty restaurant or to a plum position as area manageress . The address for application is : Personnel Officer , Lyons Catering Division , Orchard House , Orchard Street , London W.I. - Salaries and Prospects : Lyons pay their trainee teashop manageresses JJg weekly and on appointment as assistant // manageress ? i o weekly rising to L13 or L I4 . A junior trainee starting at sixteen earns ? 6 5s rising to ? g weekly and as soon as she is eighteen , if her work is satisfactory , she becomes an assistant manageress .

If they become group managers , salaries may go up to ? 1,500 . Men fill top management positions mainly , but an exceptional woman may be among them . One girl is group manager of two restaurants at the Coventry Street Corner House , and the entire Oxford Street Corner House is in the capable control of a woman house manager . Catering in a Fashion Shop Another day I called upon the Restaurant Manager of Dickins and Jones , the well-known fashion shop in Regent Street , London . This restaurant manager is a woman . She told me that her Board of Directors preferred her to use the title Manager ' . She is responsible for the running of both the public restaurant catering for 1,200 daily customers and the staff restaurant open to the 1,000 employees of the firm . A daily average of 700 to Boo lunches are served in the public restaurant , as well as teas and morning coffees . The total catering staff numbers a hundred . It 's essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manager told me , explaining that she had two first-class men chefs , one a general chef and one a pastry chef , to manage her main restaurant kitchens , and a very capable woman head cook for the staff restaurant . All her assistant cooks are women , including girls in training . In the main restaurant itself , she has two responsible women supervisors , assisted by trainee supervisors , and a number of waitresses . Part-time hostesses receive customers and show them to their tables . Chefs plan menus under the Manager 's direction and they // help her with the buying . She told me she had well-trusted suppliers ? a butcher , a poultry merchant , two dry goods firms and a Covent Garden merchant for fruit and vegetables . I believe in buying on quality not on price , although I have to consider menu pricing , naturally , ' she said . From time to time , I am offered early season goods , grouse and pheasant or the first strawberries and then I have to decide whether the price conforms to our usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertakes much of the buying under the Manager 's direction . For this work , you must be able to appreciate good quality in food , ' the Manager added . It 's a fascinating study . ' This manager was formerly a housekeeper in a luxury hotel and she went over to restaurant catering partly because she wanted to work in a non-residential position , partly because she wanted to meet more people , to widen her experience and to spread her wings . She was fortunate in training under a very good chief into whose shoes she eventually stepped . It 's a big job to learn , ' she said . You could n't expect to do it in less than three years . ' She said that a college background was certainly useful provided a girl realised she had to learn her job practically and could not step straight into a senior position . One of her chief supervisors had trained at Hendon College of Technology , another had risen through sheer ability in four years on the job , after starting as a junior at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in the offices of the firm , learning accounting procedures . Chief supervisors interview applicants for catering staff positions and if possible the Manager sees each applicant personally before acceptance . While we were talking the telephone rang and she dealt with a request for a trade reception , to include refreshments after a fashion parade . She told me she had recently arranged a dinner for their own buyers and those of another fashion shop . She showed me the menu ? pate truffle , langoustines Nicoises , roast fillet of beef and a timbale of pears . I did not need to ask if the evening had been successful . // This manager has the magic touch of personality which lifts everything out of the ordinary , combined with a natural business instinct enriched by her experience . She showed me the lovely grey-and-white china used in the main restaurant . It looked expensive but she told me she buys it from Norway at a price that makes its use an economy despite inevitable breakages . Her individuality is everywhere . It shows in the uniforms provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses with pink aprons for waitresses . I choose styles to suit all figures , ' the Manager commented . The main restaurant is a large graceful room of beautiful proportions . Pink Irish linen tablecloths have a single rose interwoven in the centre , another touch that illustrates the Manager 's taste . She told me she had had a certain amount of struggle to persuade furnishing experts to let her have the rich plum-coloured carpet that sets the tone of her colour scheme . I won in the end , ' she said smilingly , and I did not doubt that her good taste in the choice of food and furnishing contributed greatly to the bringing in of customers , the crucial test of catering ability . - Salaries and Prospects : Restaurant salaries vary considerably and these figures can only be taken as approximate , as they vary according to the style of the establishment . Most employers pay more than the minimum wages laid down by the Wages Councils . In London , a boy or girl leaving college after a two-year course may start as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 to ? 7 Ios weekly as a trainee supervisor . After experience , a girl cook may earn up to ? 12 weekly , sometimes more , or from ? 12 to ? I4 weekly as supervisor or assistant manageress . Manageresses earn from ? 600 or ? 700 up to ? 1,000 a year , or considerably higher . In London , an experienced male cook earns from ? I2 weekly , or from ? 16 to ? 25 or ? 30 weekly if he becomes a chef de partie in a first-class restaurant . Restaurant managers earn up to ? I , 000 a year , or much more . Salaries in the provinces may be rather lower . // THE CORDON BLEU The words cordon bleu signify extremely good cooking and they are normally used to describe an excellent woman cook . The use of the term is historical and to some extent legendary . The cordon bleu ? a blue ribbon ? was the insignia of the knights of the ancient French order of the Holy Spirit , created by the French king Henri III in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gastronomes , published in Paris , gives an explanation which reads : As the order was only given to personages of high distinction , it is not astonishing that one should say of a woman cook of uncommon ability " She is a cordon bleu , " as one might allude to a male chef as " a first-class chef " . ' ( My own translation ) . The well-known Larousse dictionary describes a cordon bleu as a very clever woman cook ' . ( Cuisiniere tres habile ) . Jean Conil , the celebrated French chef , gives a further explanation in his book For Epicures Only . He writes : The title cordon bleu was first bestowed by Madame de Maintenon who established a school at Saint-Cyr for the education of all the orphan daughters of noble officers . The pupils were carefully instructed in the culinary art and a blue ribbon was presented to all those who excelled as a badge of reward . ' Many tales have been told about this blue ribbon award , including the story of Louis XV who is said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man chef , whereupon his favourite , the Comtesse du Barry , took up the challenge and cooked him a meal of such perfection that he bestowed upon her the cordon bleu . Jean Conil describes this surpassing supper as including preparations of pheasant , lottes ( a fish ) , snipe , chicken fillets , fattened pullet , crayfish , peaches , green nuts and maraschino 86 // strawberries . For those who delight in the poetry of French culinary language , the menu read thus : Coulis de faisan , petites croustades de foie de lottes , salmis de becassines , pain de volaille a la supreme , poularde au cresson , e'crevisses au yin de sauterne , biscuits de peches au noyau , creme de cerneaux , fraises au marasquin . Now the words cordon bleu are mainly associated with two well-known schools of cookery in Paris and London . Former students of Le Cordon Bleu Ecole de Cuisine in Paris designate their qualification as Cordon Bleu , Paris ' . Former students holding the diploma or certificate of The Cordon Bleu Cookery School in London use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information about the school in Paris may be obtained from : La Directrice , Le Cordon Bleu Ecole de Cuisine , 24 , rue du Champ de Mars , Paris 7 . It is advisable to enclose an International Reply Coupon , obtainable from the post office . - The Cordon Bleu Cookery School , London : The main training courses are as follows : Diploma Course . One year . The course begins in September each year and is divided into three terms of twelve weeks each . School hours are from ten a.m. to four-fifteen p.m . Mondays to Fridays . The diploma examination is held at the end of the course and consists of a written and practical test . A high standard of proficiency is required to obtain the full diploma ; students not reaching this standard may be awarded a Certificate of Merit . Both awards are based upon a consistently good standard of work during the year 's training as well as upon the result of the examination . Certificate Course . Three months . This is a concentrated course covering much the same programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mondays to Fridays and the certificate is awarded to those who are successful in a practical and written examination held at the end of the three months ' training . Advanced Certificate Course . Twelve weeks . Students attend the school for four days in the week , Mondays , Tuesdays , Thursdays and Fridays . This course is intended for students // with previous training or good cooking experience who wish to attain a higher standard in their work and careers . Acceptance for the course depends upon a personal interview . Practical work covers such subjects as Entrees , Cold Buffets , Gateaux and Patisserie . No examination is held and students are awarded a Certificate of Attendance on successful progress during class . The Cordon Bleu School of Cookery also offers a number of shorter courses , afternoon and evening classes and afternoon and evening demonstrations . A six weeks ' intensive practical course covering elementary and advanced cooking is held during the summer vacation , mainly in August . Age of Entry : Students may begin training from the age of sixteen or seventeen upwards , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various courses . Entry Qualifications : School examination certificates such as G.C.E. are not essential but a good general education is an advantage . As in all cookery , arithmetical ability is necessary for calculations and those taking diploma and certificate courses should have sufficient command of English to enable them to take notes intelligently and to pass written examinations . French is useful for mastering menu terms . - Cost of Training : Diploma Course ( three terms ) : Eighty guineas per term . ( Total cost ? 252 . ) Certificate Course ( three months ) : Eighty guineas . Advanced Certificate Course ( twelve weeks ) : Seventy-five guineas . Examination Fees : Diploma ? 3 3s . Certificate ? 2 2s . As a part of their training , students are expected to lunch in the school , for which a small charge is made . The Cordon Bleu Cookery School is not residential and students whose homes are not in London or within daily travelling reach of London would have to allow for the additional cost of accommodation . And here again , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supported by grants from local education authorities , but they can make application . // The prospectus may be obtained from the Principal , The Cordon Bleu Cookery School , 31 Marylebone Lane , London W.I. At Work in the School I went along one morning to the Cordon Bleu Cookery School , anxious to see students in training . Girls taking the diploma course work in pairs , sharing the responsibility of preparing a three-course luncheon every morning . Before setting to work , they sit down with pen and paper to programme the menu , giving each item of preparation its allotted time and order of precedence , right up to the serving of the meal . The students I watched were tackling a luncheon menu which included consomme madrilene , a clear soup garnished with tomato , loin of mutton Bretonne roasted with an orange stuffing , with potatoes and chicory to accompany it , and Belvoir House pudding , a creamed mixture with diced fruit soaked in rum . Menus are by no means chosen entirely from recipes of French origin for the course includes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . Students are taught to be tidy and they wash up as they go along . They are taught all the niceties of flavouring and seasoning and they taste as they work , especially in the final stages . From basic foundation work ? boiling , braising , roasting , stewing and so on , they progress to sauces and soufliees and the variations of pastry-making . Recipes grow more and more interesting as the course progresses and students learn what to buy for each recipe . A butcher visits the school to instruct them in the choice of cuts and joints . The girls study presentation ? how to choose dishes of the right size and shape , which dish best shows each food and the importance of colour choice to make good food still more enticing . They work with gas and electric cookers . I envied the students the skills they were acquiring with chopping knife and palette knife , sauce whisk and rolling pin and the rubber spatula used for cleaning out the mixing // bowl ? no waste is allowed . I envied them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students and advised upon their progress . And , quite frankly , I envied them the appetising meal which , after appraisal by the instructress , they would sit down to eat with well deserved bon appetit ! Afternoons in the Cookery School are given up to demonstrations in which students actually participate , the instructress calling them out to help in the various operations . At the end of their course they are good practical cooks competent to tackle everything from a well-balanced home meal to a special dinner party , a cold buffet , ice-cream making and a range of cakes and pastries . Salaries and Prospects It must be understood that cordon bleu training does not confer a qualification for specified employment such as teaching , institutional management , hotel management or demonstrating , nor does it take the place of diplomas and certificates in these careers as described in other chapters of this book . Owners of such diplomas sometimes choose to add cordon bleu training to their basic qualifications , as an aid to advancement or for personal satisfaction . Many girls who train at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism or advertising , and although not all can find places in these competitive spheres , a fair number of students have been notably successful . Students from the London school often find posts in guest houses , country clubs and country inns which aim to attract a discerning clientele by the good food provided . Proprietors write in to the school with requests for a nice girl who can work in with us and act as my wife 's right hand ' . In such a position a girl might earn up to about ? 8 weekly resident , possibly more , and it is likely that she would be treated as a daughter of the house . It would be valuable experience and a girl who can cook well for the few soon learns to adapt herself to cooking for the moderate many . A cordon bleu trained cook who is willing to work in a // private household as lady cook or housekeeper usually has a choice of vacancies and in a resident position she may earn from ? 6 to ? Io weekly upwards , considerably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill positions overseas . An enterprising girl with a wide social circle might work up her own connection to cater and cook for private dinner parties , cocktail parties and receptions . This is responsible work carrying the need to adapt yourself immediately to working under unfamiliar conditions . The girl undertaking such engagements might charge up to five guineas or more for her services , her fee varying according to her clients , the number of guests and whether she undertakes cooking only or full catering arrangements . A few former students stay on to work as salaried assistants in The Cordon Bleu Restaurant ' , associated with the London school and on the ground floor of their school premises . Among young and older students of the London school , there are always those who are training for sheer love of cookery and desire to extend their skills . Many parents give young daughters a diploma course as the best preparation for future home life and happy marriage . // DEMONSTRATORS , HOME SERVICE ADVISERS AND HOME ECONOMISTS These three titles , demonstrator , home service adviser and home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls trained in domestic science who work for the Gas Boards , Electricity Boards , makers of gas and electricity appliances , organisations concerned with solid fuel , and firms which manufacture food and household products . - Type of Work : Girls who work for the Gas Boards are known as Home Service Advisers and in senior positions as Home Service Organisers . Their job is to encourage people to use gas and to help them to get the best results from their cookers , refrigerators , water heaters and other appliances , and gas heating installations . Home service advisers visit housewives in their homes to explain the correct use of new appliances and answer calls for advice in any difficulty . In the course of their work they are called upon to give a number of demonstrations , mainly for women 's organisations and schools . Electricity Boards employ qualified Service Centre Demonstrators in their showrooms , and the work includes selling and giving demonstrations in the showrooms or elsewhere , and also outside visits to customers in their homes . This work is concerned not only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dish washers , vacuum cleaners , polishers , irons , electric blankets , and so on . Service centre demonstrators also advise on water heating and space heating . They may advance to higher positions as Housecraft Advisers or Senior Demonstrators ? the two names mean much the same . In positions with manufacturers of gas and electrical 92 // appliances , the domestic science expert may be known as Home Economist or as Demonstrator . The job may include experimental work in testing kitchens , demonstrating in shops and showrooms , calling on customers and answering their letters , and helping to prepare the firm 's publicity literature . It often entails travelling , either in a large area or , in a head position , all over the country and possibly abroad . Demonstrations are given not only to the public but to demonstrators themselves in their showrooms . One main difference between working for Gas and Electricity Boards and working for appliance manufacturers is that with the former you need a good working knowledge of all the different makes of appliances , but with the latter you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you must have a more detailed and very thorough understanding , down to the last screw in their construction . Work in manufacturers ' test kitchens is carried out in close collaboration with designing engineers . In the test kitchen of one electrical manufacturing firm , the home economist and her assistants undertook ' , zoo tests on an automatic washing machine before they arrived at the correct control for washing different fabrics . She told me that the engineers , all men , often appreciate the feminine viewpoint . Even though she herself is not an engineer , she is a skilled cook and can tell them that the handle of an oven door must be easy to grasp , cool to touch and simple to clean . Another girl who worked for a gas appliance manufacturer told me that her job included devising recipes , helping to produce leaflets for customers , writing news sheets for the firm , and even preparing a complete cookery book . In firms producing foods such as flour , cooking fats , soups , table creams , canned or frozen fruits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demonstrators . There is limited employment in organisations concerned with solid fuel , an industry which embraces the supply of house coal , anthracite , dry steam coal and a number of processed smokeless fuels , and the various solid fuel burning // appliances and systems for room heating , central heating , hot water and cooking . The National Coal Board , the Coal Utilisation Council and the Women 's Advisory Council on Solid Fuel all employ a small number of Demonstrators . The Women 's Advisory Council also employs a limited number of Regional Organisers , whose duties include the organisation of meetings , exhibition stands , visits to show houses and heating centres , visits to manufacturers ' works , conferences , luncheons , receptions and coffee mornings . Many of these organisers are lecturers and demonstrators . They are provided with cars and in this position it is essential to be a driver . I must make it clear that in using the word demonstrator ' , I am referring only to demonstrators with college training in domestic science as described on p. 96 . The term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firms for which they work to show one appliance such as a vacuum cleaner , or to sell one particular food or household article in shops or at exhibitions , where their job is to grace the exhibition stand and hand out leaflets and samples to the thronging public . Their work is not comparable with that of the fully-trained demonstrator. - Personal Qualities Necessary : This is not a career for anybody and everybody who likes cooking and housecraft but for the girl with the right kind of outstanding personality . The adviser or demonstrator must be a good talker and a good mixer , able to strike a happy conversational note with everybody , whether she is talking to a schoolgirl or to a grandmother , to a farmer 's wife or to the wife of a city business-man . She needs initiative and self-confidence , and she must be intelligent and mentally alert . In her work she will have to say the same thing over and over again , always with freshness and conviction . Good looks help in this work but a winning smile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should reflect her own qualities of common sense and reliability rather than present a glamorous appearance . Grace of movement , deft hands and a pleasant voice are natural essentials which can be improved by training . // The job calls for stamina . There is much standing and sometimes the demonstrator has to carry her own equipment . She may have to work in the evening and she must appear always at the top of her form with no sign of fatigue . In the home economist 's varied work , a girl needs patience , accuracy , perseverance and a scientific curiosity in the test kitchen , artistic and creative ability in recipe presentation and , in press and public relation duties , the same gift for getting on well with people as the demonstrator . Training and Educational Qualifications Required : In past years , home economists , home service advisers and demonstrators were drawn from girls who had had various different domestic science college trainings , including those with the B.Sc. degree in Household Science , the diploma or certificate of the Institutional Management Association , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still be accepted if they choose to take up this work . More recently , however , diploma training courses in Home Economics or the Demonstrator 's Certificate of the National Council for Domestic Studies have been accepted as the usual basic qualifications . The diploma course in Home Economics is intended for girls who hope eventually to reach responsible positions , including those in advertising agencies , or to make their way into journalism . I.

The College Training I wanted to know more about the demonstrator 's training so I visited Chiswick Polytechnic , in a West London district . The Head of the Department of Home and Fashion Technology told me that she had to be very selective in admitting candidates for the demonstrator 's course . The girls she chooses must be absolutely right for the work , both in physique and in intelligence . They must be interested in people , interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE special sparkling something ' in personality which promises development . G.C.E. examination results alone are not enough , important though they are . A girl with good science gets off with a flying start , ' the Head of the Department added . She told me that it was a fall , rigorous , hardworking course and when I commented on the number of examinations taken , she said that her first-year students also enter for the City and Guilds of London Institute examination number 243 in Domestic Cookery , because it is so important for them to become skilled cooks . The Senior Tutor told me something of the girls ' experimental studies in laundrywork , ranging from the chemical composition of detergents and their physical effects on textiles to a comparison of the time , effort and cost entailed by laundering at home , using coin laundrettes and laundromats , or sending washing out to a commercial laundry . The Senior Tutor emphasised that second-year work in all branches was especially designed to develop each student 's individuality . I enquired about training for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any subject of their choice , then criticism follows . A talk lasting from three to five minutes is quite an undertaking for the beginner and she has to get used to the sound of her own voice , ' the Head of the Department said . Gradually she is led into the technique of demonstrating . Timing , choice of words , fluency and correct deportment all have to be studied . The student has to learn to work and talk at the same time and , above all , to be able to put her subject over . ' Another important study is the selection of subjects for demonstration to suit audiences in different age groups and income groups , and according to the locality . Chiswick Polytechnic , like many colleges , holds Open Days for exhibiting students ' work and on such occasions four fullscale cookery and laundry demonstrations are given , thus providing girls with useful experience in demonstrating to a public audience . // At this college , like many others , they offer a preliminary one-year course for girls under the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate . I was taken to see the demonstration theatre , a spacious room decorated in yellow , grey and mottled pink with the correct sloping mirror fixed over the demonstrator 's table on the platform . A mirrored alcove is used for practising display work . A florist visits the college to instruct first-year students in flower arrangement for display and a photographer comes to give second-year girls an insight into the presentation of recipes and dishes for press photography , of especial interest to those who want to enter journalism or advertising . A student took me over the flat where first-year girls were completing practical exercises . One girl had prepared and set out a fork luncheon in the sitting-room , another was carrying out an exercise which included the laundering of wool , cotton , silk , nylon , linen and a drip-dry fabric . A third student had completed an exercise which entailed the preparation of a Sunday dinner for four people , the menu being soup , roast lamb with garden peas and braised onions , and raspberry pudding . She had had to vacuumclean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and cook the meal , timing each operation and setting the automatic oven so as to give herself time , in imagination , for a Sunday morning stroll or going to church . And the meal was on the table , served to the moment and awaiting the tutor 's criticism ! The Gas Home Service Adviser I went to have coffee with a home service organiser for the North Thames Gas Board and two of her team of home service advisers . The organiser explained to me that under her Board there is one chief home service adviser who works with senior officers at Board level . The policy they formulate is developed by home service organisers , each one in charge of a different district and working with a team which may IO2 CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE number up to seven home service advisers . The organiser is in close collaboration with sales and service managers for her district , all of whom are men . Technical and sales demonstration training for home service advisers lasts from two to six weeks and in London trainee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre . There are twelve Gas Boards in England , Wales and Scotland and the organiser mentioned that the general set-up might differ with other Boards . The organiser introduced me to the two home service advisers . They were charming girls , each with her own individual air of distinction . They were dressed with good taste , and in a style that would not have been out of place in any surroundings . They told me that they always wear hats to give a finished and well-dressed appearance when visiting housewives . Each girl has her own personal visiting card . The two girls gave me permission to use their Christian names , so I will refer to them as Ada and Rosemary . Rosemary has the demonstrator 's certificate , Ada took a slightly different training at the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science , where she won a special award for cookery . The organiser and her team work in Central London , covering an extensive district that may take them north to Islington , west to Olympia and Kensington , south-west to Chelsea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks . It means that we go into homes of many different kinds , ' said Rosemary . One day I may be calling on a docker 's wife or popping in and out of one of those massive blocks of council flats , another day I may be in a beautiful Regency town house or a luxurious flat in Park Lane . ' Ada described their visits to mobile homes in Stepney . These are temporary houses of the very latest type , installed on sites which are awaiting building development . In such houses , gas warm-air heating takes the place of fires . The heating in each room can be controlled by opening and closing a grille , ' Ada said . It is a new idea to many // tenants and they welcome my explanation of the warm-air system especially when I tell them how to save money by using it economically . We are not out to make people increase their gas bills , you know , but to help them to get the very best use out of gas and never to waste it unnecessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does not supervise their day-to-day activities and each adviser plans her own programme according to the requests she receives . Usually they call on everyone with any equipment which has new features . Rosemary described the procedure . First you introduce yourself and most housewives very readily invite you into their kitchens , ' she said . Detailed information is given . For example , the customer may not realise how good the **27;0;TOOLONG hotplate burner is for simmering stews or for deep fat frying . We give a few tips in cooking in the course of conversation and they are always appreciated . ' The organiser said that the adviser 's stiffest and yet most interesting task was to call upon the irate housewife who had complained about her appliance . Maybe her cakes always sag in the middle , maybe she is dissatisfied with the performance of her gas refrigerator . The adviser makes her approach very tactfully . I do understand how you feel , ' she says sympathetically . Please tell me all about it . ' Before the adviser calls , the cooker will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good working order and technically correct . She goes over every detail of the making and baking of the cake . If the housewife is willing , the adviser offers to make another cake there and then , or to stand by the housewife if she prefers to do it herself . In nine cases out of ten , the fault is with the housewife herself , who may have used a wrongly balanced recipe or a baking tin that is not the right size . The adviser points out the fault in the gentlest manner possible and the interview ends in a happy understanding , especially when the housewife sees a perfect cake produced from her own cooker . If the complaint is about a refrigerator , it is nearly always I04 CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE the same story and the fault is with the user , ' said Ada . The housewife may never before have possessed a refrigera-tor and complains that one food taints another with its smell , when the trouble is that she has n't covered foods properly , or has put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defrost . And , believe it or not , there are people who think you can put stale food into a refrigerator and bring it out miraculously transformed to freshness ! ' The organiser pointed out that home service advisers ' reports on their calls provide collated information which of immense value both to Gas Boards and appliance manu facturers . Then there are the leaflets of instruction sent out by the maker with new appliances . Manufacturers try to make their instructions absolutely foolproof but they can not see the woman who is puzzling over them in her own home and finding it not always so easy to do as it says in the leaflet ' . Often the adviser pinpoints the difficulty , her report goes to the manufacturer , and the wording in the instructions is amended . Ada told me about letting days ' when large new blocks of council flats are first on view to tenants . Home service advisers receive enquiries in a flat fitted out with gas fires , a refrigerator and water heater , and several types of cooker . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comforting and reassuring the new tenant , ' Ada emphasised . Often a woman is bewildered by the impor-tance of the occasion and her husband may not have been able to get off from work to accompany her . Usually she has young children with her since it is to couples with families that these flats are mainly allocated . " Let me hold the baby and you sit down and have a cup of tea , " I tell her if she looks tired , ' Ada continued . Afterwards I show her the appliances and whether or not she decides to have them , I feel that I have helped her . These letting days are turning-points in people 's lives and a woman likes to find another woman waiting there to reassure her . ' Home service advisers do a good deal of public demonsDEMONSTRATORS // trating , and the organiser explained that there were two different classes of demonstrations ? those given as a service to the public , and those with the definite purpose of selling . Service demonstrations are given on request from schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nurses and health visitors in training . Selling demonstrations take place at large exhibitions and occasionally in collaboration with food manufacturers . Series of lunch-hour demonstrations are sometimes given for business girls , engaged couples and newly-weds in the West End of London . Many young men join the audiences . Quick cooking is of major interest in the modern household where both husband and wife go out to work , but the young housewife likes new ideas and so both English and Continental dishes are cooked and sweet and savoury foods are shown . An appetising and colourful display of dishes at the end is the culminating point of every demonstration , ' the organiser told me . Home service advisers sometimes have to make a home call or give demonstrations in the evening . I gather this is no job for the clock-watcher who likes fixed working hours . The organiser spoke of the wonderful esprit de corps that exists in the gas industry . Advisers receive tremendous co-operation from sales representatives and from fitters . The men value their work , and so do the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( now an integral part of the North Thames Gas Board ) that housewives made the first requests for women advisers to call at their homes , over fifty years ago . The two girls told me that they enjoy their life because they feel at the end of the day 's work they have helped the housewife in a constructive way . And they thrive on the variety it brings since no two days are alike . The Electrical Demonstrator It was laundry instruction day when I visited the Commercial Training Centre of the London Electricity Board . I Io6 CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE found myself in a large wide room , its wall space entirely filled with washing machines , cookers and ironers , at which trainee demonstrators were working . Each student must use a machine with which she is not yet familiar , ' the instructor told me . Machines do the work but users have to think for them , ' she added . It requires considerable study to learn the intelligent use of the whole range of equipment and students ' knowledge must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct instruction in the performance of every different type of machine . ' I followed the instructor round the room and heard her giving advice or criticism . One student was learning how to programme a large automatic machine that could wash , rinse and spin-dry , others were practising on semiautomatics , twin tubs and wringer types . Several students were taking careful observations of a machine with a filter fitting that collected fluff . Trainee demonstrators with their college background come into the training centre with a reasonably good knowledge of machinery but they still have a great deal to learn , ' the instructor told me . Progress depends upon individual ability and one girl may grasp essential points more quickly than another . ' I watched one of the girls using a flat bed ironer with skilled dexterity . There was little doubt in my mind that she would make a good demonstrator for in the four minutes that it took her to iron a man 's shirt , she had told me the exact order of procedure ? cuffs and sleeves , saddle ( the yoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other front and the final polishing ' of the collar . A housewife who can afford one of these flat bed ironers can get through a family 's ironing in about an hour , ' she said , while she folded the garment expertly . She does n't tire herself , for the ironer has finger-tip pressure and it is designed to be used while you sit at the work . ' But the well-loved and familiar hand iron is much less expensive and I went on to watch another trainee demonstrator at her ironing-board . She gave me a talk about steam irons . // It 's as simple as can be , ' she said . You fill the base of the iron with distilled water and then switch on . The iron heats in the time it takes you to set up your ironing board and it 's wonderful for freshening up a dress or putting a perfect crease into a man 's trousers . ' She was a pretty girl and I thought that she would have little difficulty in achieving one major essential in successful platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every woman see herself at her own home tasks , looking just as charming and capable as the girl on the platform . Afterwards I heard more about the electrical demonstrator 's training in the London Electricity Board , although the instructor mentioned that training procedures might be different in other parts of the country . In London , soon after a girl is accepted as trainee demonstrator , she comes to the training centre for a five weeks ' course . She studies the history of the electrical industry and she learns about Consumers ' Consultative Committees . She learns about tariffs and accounts since she may have to satisfy the customer who calls to enquire about the electricity bill . She studies the design and control of appliances . She must be familiar with a wide range of refrigerators , for instance , both the silent heat absorption type and those with a motor compressor . She gains a good practical knowledge of cookers , from the small cooker suitable for a bachelor 's flat right up to the microwave cooker and the largest , fully automatic double oven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board showrooms where she meets customers and shows appliances . Her training is under the supervision of the senior demonstrator or housecraft adviser for the area and she makes her first calls on housewives , usually under the wing of an experienced demonstrator . She is not likely to begin platform demonstration work for at least a year . The staff training instructor had been an area senior demonstrator formerly and she told me how she used to introduce the beginner to the demonstration platform . First I used to let her fetch and carry and wash up IOS CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE dishes so as to become accustomed to standing and working in front of an audience , ' the instructor said . Then I allowed her to demonstrate the cooking of one item , a mixed grill perhaps or a sauce that shows low simmering on the hotplate . The girl 's own personal progress is the deciding factor as to when she is entrusted with a full demonstration . Some girls are over-confident and have to be held back a little . Other girls may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they begin to experience the " feel " of the audience . ' In about two years ' time , the demonstrator comes back to the training centre for a fortnight 's revision course . After not less than four years ' experience , two of them in a responsible position , an ambitious girl may set her mind on gaining the Diploma of the Electrical Association for Women , an essential qualification for a position as housecraft adviser or senior demonstrator . The candidate for the diploma must give a formal , high standard demonstration in cookery or laundrywork , or both , and an on-the-spot demonstration of any appliance chosen by the examiner . She must also acquit herself satisfactorily in a viva voce examination . Holders of the E.A.W. Diploma are in the running for the annual award of a travelling exhibition named after the late Dame Caroline Haslett . This takes the winner on a tour abroad to study electrical housecraft in Europe , North America , Australasia or other countries . The Caroline Haslett Memorial Trust also awards scholarships to young women training for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is unique in offering a chance for training to the girl who is unable to go to college for a full-time demonstrator course . Trainee showroom saleswomen aged from about sixteen to eighteen can study for examinations in cookery , home management and electrical housecraft by day release and evening classes . Such study extends over about five years and it qualifies for demonstrator work in the electrical industry but not , as a rule , in other spheres . The training centre is in the east end of London and next // door are the Poplar Electricity Showrooms . The instructor took me into them and introduced me to the demonstrator on duty . She was wearing a navy blue dress with the motif of the London Electricity Board ? L.E.B. in scarlet letters . On the platform , demonstrators wear white dresses made in exactly the same style . The skirts are permanently pleated and the fabric is a mixture of terylene and rayon , easily laundered . The demonstrator showed me one of her cookers , just as she would show it to a customer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heat is there instantly at the turn of a switch , ' she said , opening the oven door and taking out the roast tin to display its size . She told me how easy it is to keep the cooker clean , a major selling point with electric cookers . If the customer is a mother with a young family , I advise her to buy a cooker with switches that are well out of children 's reach and she can have a safety hob too , ' the demonstrator added . Whenever a new cooker , refrigerator or washing machine is delivered , a card is enclosed which the purchaser is invited to fill in , requesting a visit from the demonstrator , and these cards occasion most of her outside home calls . She told me that her showroom sales include lamps , fuses , plugs , firebars , heaters , fans and hair dryers as well as larger appliances , and she gives each caller the fullest attention , whether she seems likely to make a definite purchase or is merely interested generally ' . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems . It 's amazing how many men buy household appliances all on their own , ' the demonstrator said . A man may be planning a birthday present and he always seems confident that the wife will approve of his choice . I take particular care to enquire into the size of house , kitchen and family , so as to give him the best possible guidance . ' The demonstrator described a special laundry week ' during which she gave window demonstrations of ironing every morning . The assignment called for great composure in working serenely while onlookers paused outside to II0 CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE watch her operations . And she told me about a demonstration she had given to young mothers from a local infant welfare centre . This demonstrator is by no means a novice but , like many good actresses , she still experiences nervousness before her show begins . She told me her opening words . Good afternoon . On behalf of the London Electricity Board , I am happy to welcome you to this demonstration . ' The words act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I lose myself entirely , ' she told me . At the end of the hour 's demonstration , I find I have enjoyed it just as much as I hope the audience themselves have . ' I was lucky in meeting a manufacturer 's demonstrator who happened to be in the showroom . Her duties take her round week by week to six different Electricity Board showrooms and to one large store in the district . She enjoys the change of environment . Afterwards , I returned to the training centre , where the instructor was lecturing on costs and economies in using washing machines . She held up a large packet of synthetic detergent and explained that half of it , at a cost of about a shilling , would be required for each use of a large automatic washing machine , and the cost of heating water had to be counted too . Therefore it was essential to consider the family income when advising the purchase of a large machine , and to bear in mind the fact that if the housewife economised and did not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions , the laundrywork would not be satisfactory . When dealing with a woman who had to count her sixpences carefully , it was better to advise a smaller machine of a type in which sudsy water can be stored and used a second time . The instructor has a pleasantly clear and carrying voice and every word she spoke reached me although I was sitting at the back of the room , and the roar of London traffic came through the open windows . Afterwards the instructor told me that voice production and the study of fluent , intelligent public speaking are DEMONSTRATORS AND HOME SERVICE ADVISERS III essential to the demonstrator 's training . The British Electrical Development Association runs annual public speaking competitions open to young people of both sexes under the age of thirty-five who are working in the electrical industry . A girl who wins first place in her area competition is awarded a prize of ten pounds and has the honour of coming up to London to take part in national finals , with the chance of winning the Faraday Shield for her area for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent keeping . Competitors are judged on the structure of the speech and the thought and imagination they put into it , on their choice of words , their platform manner and the way they use the natural qualities of their voices . They speak for not less than ten minutes on a subject concerned with electricity and they lose marks if they go on talking longer than the maximum of fifteen minutes allowed . All our training is wasted if a girl 's voice can not be heard , ' the instructor said as she shook hands on my departing . Every word that she utters must be audible in every part of the room . ' Demonstrating Solid Fuel On another occasion I had a chat with the demonstrator who works at the London headquarters of the Women 's Advisory Council on Solid Fuel . There is a demonstration kitchen on the premises and as well as putting on shows for interested organisations , she often demonstrates to groups of students , including those from her own former training college . She gives her demonstrations single-handed , working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an hour and a half . I devote the first fifteen minutes to an introductory talk about my cooker , ' she told me . It is a freestanding cooker with a boiler that feeds the sink and would supply hot water all over the house if it were in your own home . The big hotplate holds five average sized pans and the heat is graduated from boiling to simmering heat . There are two ovens . II2 CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE The big roasting oven has a steady , even , all round heat that makes cooking easy and the warming oven will keep plates and dishes warm , or a cooked meal hot for hours without spoiling . ' Students always like to know about economy and she tells them exactly how much fuel is used and how reasonable the cost is . Cheapness is one of their major selling points , she explained . She described a typical demonstration menu , designed to utilise every part of the cooker . Usually I make a casserole dish , ' she said . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes down well . For vegetables , I may have potatoes and carrots or maybe red peppers , since people expect something out of the ordinary in demonstrations . A lemon meringue pie demonstrates the use of the lower oven and I make something special in the way of a gateau . It is usually a Victoria sponge , for cooking speed , decorated with peaches , piped whipped cream and boudoir biscuits , and I tie the cake with ribbon to give a festive touch . ' She likes demonstrating to students because they are interested in technique and ask innumerable questions . This demonstrator likes giving a one-woman show , too . The responsibility is all her own and in proving the virtues of her cooker she has a happy feeling of personal achievement . A Manufacturer 's Food and Cookery Centre A week later I went along to the Unilever Food and Cookery Centre in the City of London . Most people connect Unilever with washing detergents , household cleaners and toilet soaps and not everyone realises that among a host of other products , Unilever 's subsidiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen fruits and vegetables , soups , meat pies , fish and sausages . The Food and Cookery Centre is a home economics advisory service concerned especially with the names of Batchelors , Birds Eye , Mac Fisheries and Wall 's ice cream and meat products . The principal director told me that // there are three different sides to their activities in the Centre ? testing and development , creation and demons tration . Home economists in the test and development kitchen under-take test work on new and current products of the firm 's associated companies and they are responsible for producing the preparation directions that you read on the pack or carton . Testing procedure includes cooking the food in many different ways , using different cookers and water of different degrees of hardness . It includes minute and detailed visual examination of food and packaging , the conducting of tasting panels , and shopping expeditions in which two home economists set out to visit six shops or supermarkets in a district with the aim of buying the same six foods in each , and foods produced by competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The home economists look and act like other shoppers but they observe how shop and store people stock and present foods , whether supplies look clean and fresh and attractive , whether frozen food cabinets are frosted inside or stacked above the load line , and which brands are available , in demand and selling swiftly . Resulting reports are of infinite value in the long , careful trial and assessment that goes to the launching of a new product , in keeping up standards and suggesting changes in current products and in providing expert , knowledgeable advice as to what women need and like to buy . The director explained that economists in the creative kitchen are girls with a gift for devising original recipes and presenting them artistically . Their duties include collabora tion with photographers and keeping in touch with cookery editors of newspapers and magazines and those concerned with advertising and TV . The third section of the Centre 's activities is a demonstration service , introducing the final results of the work carried out in development and creative kitchens directly to the public . Four demonstrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of a demonstration organiser , and four demonstrators , all north country girls , are employed in a I14 CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE Manchester Centre . Audiences vary from youth club members to Townswomen 's Guilds and political associations , from college students and schoolgirls to domestic science teachers themselves , for whom high standard demonstrations and occasional Saturday courses are arranged , with a view to keeping teachers in touch with the latest trends . I asked the director if she would tell me something about her own career . I began as a domestic science teacher and went to America under the exchange teacher scheme , ' she said . When my year in an American school was up , I was n't ready to come home and I took any job I could get . I worked on a newspaper in the Middle West and for a time I did fashion modelling , including a tour for Christian Dior . Later I worked on the staff of a Family Circle magazine which was sold through the supermarkets . The magazine had an enormous cookery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England and worked as the organiser of experimental kitchens in one of Unilever 's food companies . And then the Principal of this Advisory Centre retired and I was invited to step into her Shoes . ' It was a fascinating story , illustrating how a woman of exceptional ability with a sound domestic science training had risen to a top organising position in the vast business of commercial food production . Afterwards I was permitted to see the test and development kitchen , where visitors from the outside world are normally not allowed , since much of the work is confidential . The colour scheme in the test kitchen is muted . Work benches are covered with grey-blue formica , the shade chosen with a purpose because white reflects too much glare . Acoustic ceilings concealed piping and wiring under the natural ceiling , thus eliminating dirt traps . I was shown the tasting bench . Panels of tasters may be asked to record their preferences on a food sample 's colour , texture and flavour , or on flavour alone . // Colour affects the palate and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was told . So when flavour alone is to be assessed , part of the kitchen is blacked out and samples are placed under a light that reduces them to uniform greyness . Two dairy cream sponges were being tested while I was in the kitchen . Home economists had already examined the cartons , finding their weight when frozen and noting that one cake had stuck to the wrapping and thus some of the cake 's surface had been lost . The cakes had been left to thaw , following directions on the pack , and later sponge and the cream filling would be tested and assessed according to a set procedure . Cupboards had adjustable shelving , since they never know how much stock they may have to accommodate and large fiberites ( the cases ) may contain up to forty-eight packs . I noticed the scales , which are serviced regularly by the makers and weigh accurately down to one-sixteenth of an ounce . Laboratory balances , as used with recipes for factory production , weigh down to one-hundredth of a gramme and they use standard British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple pies and mincemeat , partly because it is their business to know what is available to shoppers , and also for pure interest , a fact which illustrated the appeal of this work to a girl with scientific leanings coupled with a real womanly interest in the housewife 's food purchases , right down to the weight she can carry in her shopping bag . I was taken into the creative kitchen , a light airy room with a cheerful colour scheme , red and yellow cupboards contrasting with blue formica table tops and scattered coloured tiles in a white floor . The kitchen contained a dining recess where cookery editors are entertained to lunch and shown new recipes , in the hope that they will select dishes for use in their magazines . Home economists in this kitchen need to have versatile abilities . They must be skilled , imaginative , creative cooks , capable of accurate recipe compilation . They must have artistic ideas for photography . They must be good hostesses , I16 CAREERS IN CATERING AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE able to think out menus and entertain guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an asset to the home economist , whose work is closely linked with the preparation of recipe literature . The Centre publishes a helpful quarterly bulletin for domestic science teachers and demonstrators . I had a talk with the demonstration organiser , who told me that her programme of demonstrations was always fully booked for at least : eighteen months ahead . Demonstrators give an average of four or five demonstrations a week , of which two may be in the evening , when girls have the morning off to go to the hairdresser 's or to spend an extra hour or two in bed . During school term times , one demonstrator is away from . London for three or four days each week , each girl 's turn for a long distance ' assignment occurring approximately once in four weeks . For long or shorter journeys , she makes her own travelling arrangements and it is her own responsibility to be punctual . When away from London , she stays in hotels . She meets people of consequence in the course of her work and she may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer of her own company . For the time being , she is her company 's representative and she must have an understanding of the responsibility of her own position . I enquired where the Centre 's demonstrators were on that particular day . One girl is in Cornwall and one girl will be demonstrating here this afternoon , ' the organiser said . A third demonstrator is going down to Windsor and the fourth to a school in North London . We do extensive demonstration to school children and also in medical spheres . ' The girl who was going to Windsor appeared in the doorway at that moment , looking fresh and spruce in a cherry red suit and a small white hat . Demonstrators have to dress well and make a good impression on arrival . This demonstrator was going to give a talk and demonstration to the Women 's Institute on ice cream dishes and she opened the hold-all she was carrying to show me the small // plastic containers of stewed apple , pear halves , glace cherries , black coffee , walnut halves and blanched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tablecloth , wafers , recipe leaflets , spoons and tiny plates on which she would hand round samples were included , and her crease-resisting primrose-coloured overall went on top . She told me she had arranged for a local depot to deliver ice cream to the hall at a definite time and it was her concern to produce the ice cream at the right working temperature . Probably the meeting would begin with the reading of minutes and if this took longer than she expected , she must n't look worried while waiting to begin her demonstration , but instead take an interest in proceedings and try to make some apt reference to the Institute 's activities during her talk . Demonstrators travel by public transport but expenses for taxis and porters are allowed in long distance assignments . The organiser took me into the preparation kitchen , where the girl giving the afternoon demonstration in the Centre had been working all the morning . A demonstration is like an iceberg , ' the organiser remarked . One-seventh shows and the other six-sevenths keep it steady , meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning and preparation . ' We went on into the demonstration theatre , entering by the door used by demonstrators themselves , so that I was able to examine the back of the demonstration table , with its ample waste bin and underneath racks filled with adjustable shelves from which trays can be swiftly slid in and out . One tray is used for one dish and the demonstration table must always be kept uncluttered , I was told .
