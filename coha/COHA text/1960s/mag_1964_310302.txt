" Would you want your daughter to marry a white man ? " <P> That was the sense of a question put to 721 Chicago Negro families by University of Chicago Sociologists Donald Bogue and Jan Dizard in a four-year study financed by the Ford Foundation . Bogue and Dizard found that nearly half the Negroes said they would try to prevent an interracial marriage , or would permit it only after strong opposition . Most of the others claimed that it " made no difference " if their children married whites . Only a minute percentage-1.1% of Negroes living in slums and 2.5% of Negroes in middle-and upper-income neighborhoods-said that they would encourage their children to marry whites . <P> " Eighty percent or more of Negro parents would permit their child to marry a white person if the romance had already developed without their knowledge , " said the sociologists , " but there is no evidence of a desire for miscegenation , or even interest in promoting it , except among a very tiny minority . " <P> Bogue and Dizard went on to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 839 white families interviewed . Among their findings : <P> &gt; Forty-eight percent of the Negroes said they wanted to live in neighborhoods where whites and Negroes were about equal in number ; 25% said they did n't care one way or another ; 22% wanted to live in neighborhoods that were predominantly or wholly Negro ; and 5% said they would prefer to live apart from other Negroes . <P> &gt; " A majority of the Negroes denied that their race kept them from getting ahead as fast as other people . When faced with discrimination . Negroes tend to become either passively or actively regretful-they , either feel depressed or they get angry . Only about one Negro in 16 believes the Negro is at fault ; overall , the Negroes place the blame for the behavior of the whites upon the culture and tradition of the whites and hence believe a good part of the problems of race relations is one of changing the white culture . Negroes do not place all of the blame for the problem of discrimination on the whites , however . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to adopt the position that some , but not most of the troubles that Negroes have are their own fault-their behavior patterns , their outlook on life , and so on . " <P> &gt; " Among whites , persons of European ancestry generally showed the greatest desire for residential segregation . About 8% would dislike living near Italians or Jews . More than one-fifth would not like to live near Japanese . Over 75% would dislike living next to Negroes . The Jewish population itself appears to have a rather high level of prejudice against other groups , especially with regard to Negroes and Puerto Ricans . In fact , Jewish respondents showed a greater level of prejudice toward others than others toward Jews . Negroes are anti-Italian and anti-Semitic to nearly the same extent as native Europeans .
