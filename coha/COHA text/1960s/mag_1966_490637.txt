THE TALK , OF THE TOVN Notes and Comment WE do n't know quite what to make of the situation at Rutgers , which has declined to appoint Mr. Norman Fruchter writer-inresidence because he refuses to sign the loyalty oath that is required of all its employees . There is no doubt that Rutgers was entitled  --  in fact , obliged by law  --  to act as it did . And if we were in Mr. Fruchter 's position we would not stand upon the niceties of academic freedom hut , rather , would swear , with great good humor , not to overthrow the government by " force , or violence , or other unlawful unconstitutional means . " Indeed , our temperament is such that we would probably agree , if the university demanded it , never to kick our students or set the university on fire . However , we ca n't help doubting whether the Rutgers oath is in any degree wise or useful . Suppose , to go on with our hypothesis , we were asked to sign the oath , and suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ve could , of course , then sign the oath , for much the some reasons that a man on his way to bomb a police station would not hesitate to pork his car in a no-parking zone . Surely anyone who intends the Woody downfall of his country 's government will not boggle at telling a few lies . Taken all around , a faculty loyalty oath amounts to nothing more than another useless form to fill out , in a milieu that is already too rich in useless forms . After all , most of us earn our bread without subscribing to a loyalty oath , and never feel the lack . There is no reason for imposing it on our profesSOLS . Ve also suspect that there is scant reason to fear a violent uprising by the recipients of Medicare , who make up the latest group to he required  --  under some circumstances , at least  --  to sign a disclaimer of Communist affiliation  --  Nny legislator who fears that a cabal of sick old men and women may seize the radio stations in their palsied grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , it seems to us , a legislator who really fears too much . Baked SEVERAL days ago , we went over to the Museum of Contemporary Crafts , on Fifty-third Street , a few doors west of the Museum of Modern Art , to see an exhibition of the art of baking expressed in traditional breads and in modern dough sculpture . We were met at the door by the director of the Museum , Paul J. Smith , a tall and stooped young man wearing rectangular glasses with tortoiseshell rims , and a baggy brown tweed suit . Dangling from the ceiling above his head were bagels and small loaves of rye bread , suspended by nylon fishing lines and metal springs , respectively . " They make a noise , " Mr. Smith said happily , knocking some of the bagels together to produce a harmonious series of rather dull cloaks . He gave a couple of the rye loaves a pull , and they bounced up and dawn silently but affirmatively . The iViliseum , a small and cheerful place , looked like a setting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue , and pink walls in which were inset glass cases containing all sorts of breads and cookies . On the floor were low , circular display tables covered with transparent-plastic bubble tops . Inside the nearest bulahle we saw three gingerbread men from Mexico . " We 've collected breads from all over the world , " Mr. Smith said . " Bread is made for many purposes , you know- - fat rituals , ceremonies , and holiday festivities as well as for just plain eating . Throughout history , man has considered baking a magical and sacred process  --  a medium for expressing his beliefs and his fantasies , and just expressing himself . This exhibition is concerned with the visual power of breads and cookies as shapes and decorations . Cookies arc the festive form of bread , and they 're made from Boughs that ore more predictable than yeast ( loughs . Let 's go upstairs . " Following Mr. Smith to the mezzanine , we found another dreamlike room , this one containing chess figures and marionettes , a carrousel , an airplane , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sugar pones , and a menagerie of real and imagined animals  --  all concocted of cookie or bread dough or gingerbread and brightly decorated with colored icings . In one corner , there was a sculpture of three loaves of bread being squeezed by clamps of real wood ( " A combination of opposing elements , the soft and organic with the hard and machinelike , " said Mr. Smith ) , and nearby was a dough model of a gin bottle with a real label reading " Gilbey 's Distilled London Dry Gin . " " You ca n't imagine the problems we 've had in trying to keep the exhibition from falling apart , " Mr. Smith said . " Fortunately , we 've had the services of a very good cookie doctor , Helen Feingoltl , who prepares food for TV commercials . She came over and injected the exhibits with formaldehyde , using a hypodermic needle . Then we covered the surfaces with lacquer and sprayed diem with plastic . " Downstairs , a child began crying . " Hungry , " Mr. Smith said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Adults , too . We 've thought of 20 JANUARY 8 , 19 G G having sonic sort of concession , but we bad a thousand visitors the first weekend we opened , and we ca n't feed everybody . At our private opening , the guests came in formal dress and made cookies right here . Some beautiful things came out of that party , and we would have put them in the show if they had n't been eaten . " Mr. Smith appeared earnest , distracted , and jolly as he led us down to the main floor . " The malleability and simplicity of dough invite the invention of forms , " he said . " It can be kneaded and rolled , then cut or pressed into molds , and the heat from the oven puffs and colors it , creating surprising effects . The wonderful thing about dough is that it 's inexpensive and available , and the baker  --  whether a housewife or a professional  --  can improvise easily and spontaneously . The sculptor is attracted to it because it expresses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impermanence is especially frustrating to museum directors . Our knowledge of history in the area of foods is limited simply because the history is eaten . Now Pro going to show you some traditional forms of baking . " He showed us gracefully braided Greek , Finnish , and Neapolitan loaves , some with colored eggs hidden in the braids ; a Ukrainian wedding bouquet of tiny white bread birds mounted on green-paper-andwire stems ; Swiss Schafbi ; cke cookies , formed like sheep lying in a meadow and symbolizing the Lamb of God ; a gingerbread woman with three breasts ( an ancient fertility symbol , from Italy ) ; a hallah , or Jewish wedding loaf , about four feet long , dark , and braided ; a large Czechoslovakian gingerbread heart with white frosting , red-and-yellow sugar roses , and a mirror in the center , sold at fairs as a present for sweethearts ; and a collection of Ecuadorian bread dolls decorated with intricate flowers , leaves , and arabesques , and used as gifts for the living and the dead on All Souls ' Day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingerbread house , three feet high , with a roof of white frosting and trimmings of cherries , nuts , and candies . Three small Egtires  --  Wanscl , Gretel , and the Witch  --  stood in front of the house . A fly sitting on the witch 's head flew away as we approached . " There 's something I want to show you in the basement , " Mr. Smith said . " Some of John Fischer 's sculpture  --  a bagel with a padlock through the hole , and a wounded bread . " The basement turned out to be a chaos of cupboards and tables piled high with boxes of bread and cookies . Mr. Smith looked around with a bewildered air . " A lot of these are duplicates . Sometimes our exhibits crumble or melt under the lights , in spite of all we do to preserve them , so we keep duplicates down here , where it 's cooler . Oh , here 's the wounded bread . " He held up a large Italian loaf with a bandage around its middle and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what happened to that padlocked bagel . " His eyes travelled over the room . " I 've got to have this basement straightened up . You know , I 've been looking at all this stuff for months , and I 've come to think so persistently of bread as an in-. teresting object that when I go into a restaurant and see it on the table I do n't know what to do with it . " ? Q/GN observed on a Seventh Avenue n ewsstand LIBROS EN ESPAROL EN STOCK inaugurcztion JOHN VLIET LINDSAY 'S first day as Mayor of New York City began , as everybody knows , in the turmoil surrounding the failure of the Transit Authority and the unions representing some thirty-Eve thousand bus and subway workers to agree on a contract  --  a failure that touched off the first comprehensive transit strike in the city 's history . At 12:45 A.m. on January 1st , Mr. Lindsay went on television to issue instructions to the public for dealing with the crisis , saying , " This is a time for people to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . . . The health , safety , and welfare of eight million people are at stake . " After noting that negotiations were to resume a few hours later at the Americana Hotel , Mr Lindsay added , " I will not be there . I 'll be at City Hall , for my job is running the city , which is a struck city . " Later that morning , we set out for the Americana , where we hoped to learn how the talks were progressing before we started on the longer trek to City Hall . We managed to catch a cab , and midtown traffic looked almost normal . But any possibility of a quick settlement of the strike had vanished early in the day , we discovered , and by noon the words of the antagonists were becoming more acid . Michael Quill , the head of the Transport Workers Union , who earlier had said , " I blame the Transit Authority , not the Alayor , " was now saying , " The people of New York have been plunged into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times , " and was calling Mr. Lindsay a " pip-squeak " and a " juvenile . " In Albert Hall , on the hotel 's lower lobby floor , we found that tables covered with green cloths had been set up amid television cameras , lights , sound equipment , and miles of electric cables . Mr. Lindsay , who had allowed himself only two hours ' sleep , had by now made two more addresses to the city , in the course of which he had taken cognizance of Mr. Quill 's epithets by saying , " I do n't mind what they call me personally , but I think that the office of Mayor of New York City is one that deserves respect .... The strike will , in the best of circumstances , impose untold hardships on the people of New York . " Television crews , photographers , and newspapermen were churning about the Hall , a rather ornate , blue-carpeted assembly room , which now looked cluttered and utilitarian , and one reporter was hunched over a specially installed phone , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the top : Mike Quill called Mayor Lindsay a dope today and said he would n't go to City Hall if the Mayor asked him . ' He had his chance yesterday , ' Quill said . ' Now we do n't need him . ' Quill estimates the strike may last a month or more , . . . " Not far off , two men were deep in conversation with a girl who was wearing a hunter 's red cap . One of the men said , " Wagner must be laughing his head off , " and the other said , " Or crying his eyes out . " The girl looked noncommittal . We found a huge urn of coffee and poured ourself a cup while a tape recorder played back part of Mr. Lindsay 's latest address to the city : " I have been and I still remain committed to the principle that the public interest must be served . . . . This is an illegal strike , and the court has issued an injunction against it . " False alarms ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) swept periodically through the room , but at about two o'clock a commotion indicated that something really was about to happen . A television director began intoning , " Still in the clear , Dick ? O.K. , Billy ? Not full lights , though  --  better . . . . One , two , three , four , checking . .. . We 're going live . N.B.C . and I are going live .... Are you O.K. , Billy ? " In a few moments , Dr. Nathan Fein-singer , the mediation chairman , and his two colleagues on the mediation panel , Theodore Mice and Sylvester Garrett , arrived and sat down in the glare of floodlights . THE NEW YORKER 21 " The techniques in advance of a strike are one thing . The techniques after are another thing , " Dr. Fein-singer said , somewhat wearily . " We 'll have to adapt our techniques .... Ve have to see if we can pick up the pieces . We wo n't ask Mr. Lindsay to intervene until the appropriate time , and that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we 're not . " " Who ? " a newsman called out " Machiavelli , " said Dr. Feinsinger . " He was an old mediator . " When the interview had ended , with a statement that no so Ilion was in sight , we headed for the door , passing on the way a brunette in an Op Art dress who was talking to a very thin male companion . She said , " I wonder how he is in negotiations  --  Quill , I mean . He could n't possibly be the way he is in public . " The thin man replied , " I think he is . " Outside the hotel , we found another cab and headed for City Hall . Our driver , who took us down the West Side Highway , told us , " Mayor Wagner  --  he 's smart . He says , To hell with this thing , I 'm going to Mexico . ' You can understand it . Since he got married to that girl , he has n't had even a minute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got out at Broadway and Warren Street , and walked the rest of the way to City Hall , where the inheritor of Mayor Wagner 's troubles was said to be finishing his inaugural address behind locked doors . Mayor Lindsay had been officially sworn in at six o'clock the previous evening , but a more elaborate public ceremony is traditional in New York . Six ceremonies had been planned  --  two in Manhattan and one in each of the other boroughs  --  but now , because of the strike , they had all been scrapped except one , which would be held that evening on the steps of City Hall . Police barricades had been tr set up around the front of the building , and , television cameras and floodlights were mounted on metal scaffolding some two hundred feet from its long portico . We climbed the steps of the portico and went into the City Hall foyer , which leads into two hallways . In one direction was the Mayor 's suite , in which Mr. Lindsay was presumably preparing his speech , and in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather young , came and went , wearing perky  --  or , at any rate , confident  --  expressions , In the other direction was the pressroom , outside which Dick Levitan , who had been broadcasting the crisis news from City Hall over WINS all day , was briefing another announcer , Herb Humphries , who was about to relieve him . " Lindsay says that at the appropriate time the negotiators should come to City Hall , " Levitan was saying . " Quill says he ai n't goin ' nowhere . So we 've got a personality clash there .... " We stepped inside the pressroom , which was small and smoky and overcrowded . Woody Klein , Mayor Lindsay 's press secretary , was reading , very slowly , the first half of the inaugural address for the benefit of the assembled newsmen . ( The second half , we were told , was as j et incomplete . ) " . . honest disagreement and human error within the offices of our government . ' Period . Paragraph , " Mr. Klein was saying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Yorkers of tomorrow ' dash by proving their readiness to accept the inconveniences and irritations ' comma ' the hardships and responsibilities ' comma ' that inust accompany any transition . ' Period .... " We made our way out of the pressroom as Mr. Klein continued his slow reading of Mr. Lindsay 's speech : " ' Let those who exploit human addiction hear me clearly ' colon New York will no longer be your marketplace . ' Period . " ? Nru started down the other hallway and soon spotted Deputy Mayor Robert Price , who was wearing a white shirt with the cuffs turned up and looked about as vibrantly busy as anyone we have ever seen . Mr. Price was firing off instructions , answering questions , and appearing and disappearing through a number of doorways in the region of the Mayor 's suite . As we approached him , he handed us a book from the top of a stack he was carrying , and , before we could thank him , disappeared again . The book was one that had been published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , " by Daniel E. Button . We went out to get ourself another cup of coffee . Returning to City Hall at around seven o'clock , we found that a large JANUARY 8 , 1 9 G ( , crowd had gathered in front of the portico . Dozens of United States and New York City flags were hung behind a long , hunting-draped dais , which stood out vividly in the white floodlights . The Manhattanaires Drum and Bugle Corps , in white coats , blue trousers , and black busbies , stood at attention behind the dais . The night was mild  --  the temperature had been in the sixties earlier in the day  --  and the moon , just entering the third quarter , was ringed with haze . Some fifteen hundred spectators were seated in folding wooden chairs , and a thou- sand or so stood behind them . They were all quite still . There was a murmuring and the crowd broke into applause as the inaugural party emerged from the front entrance of City Hall  --  Ethel Merman , Bennett Cerf , Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comptroller Mario Procaccino , Governor and Mrs. Rockefeller , Senator and Mrs. Jacob Javits , Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz , all the new city commissioners , and other officials . Mr. Cerf , who presided over the ceremony , said , " They said it would be a cold , wintry day when a Republican became Mayor of New York . We 've got the winter , all right , but the cold has been dispelled by Mr. Quill . " Everyone laughed . Miss Merman sang " The Star-Spangled Banner . " Everyone applauded . The Right Reverend Horace AV . B. Donegan , Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York , gave the invocation , saying , " In the loneliness of great office , keep his heart serene .... " Mayor Lindsay again took the oath of office ( it was identical with the one be had taken the previous evening ) , and then , reading from notes and speaking in a strong , penetrating , and often fervent voice , he gave his inaugural address : " My fellow New Yorkers , New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that threatens to destroy them . New York symbolizes the traditional aspirations of man  --  power , fame , and wealth . Yet it magnifies every adversity of city living  --  the crowds , the noise , the dirt , the innumerable accommodations and sacrifices exacted from those who live in an urban society . It is a city in which individuals have been characterized by vigor and affluence ; New Yorkers have always sought out the newest and best in their own lives . As citizens , however , they collectively tolerated a government possessing neither attribute  --  until now . Last November 2nd , the people of New York decided that their government was not good enough ; that it must do better . They voted for a change in leadership , one which would promise to restore to this city the imprimatur of pride . " When the Mayor had finished his speech , Rabbi Max Schenk , president of the New York Board of Rabbis , read from the Bible , and the Drum and Bogie Corps swung into " A Foggy Day " and " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly , Mr. O'Connor predicting that this would he a " non-partisan , or hi-partisan , or tri-partisan , or ecumenical form of government for New York City , " and Mr. Procaccino saying , " Maybe coalition government is a good thing .... Politics must end the moment public responsibility begins . " Mr. Lindsay swore in the new city commissioners , and after the benediction , by the Most Reverend Fulton J. Sheen , the inaugural party started back into the building , amid great applause . Hands appeared from all sides to shake the Mayor 's hand , and Mr. Lindsay , smiling broadly , kept saying , " Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . " The Mayor 's party was to dine in his suite at the Hotel Roosevelt , so we caught a cab in that direction , and we managed to get there at eight-thirty , just in time to see Mr. and Mrs. Lindsay , their children  --  Katharine , Margaret , Anne , and John , Jr. ? and a few friends enter the lobby , still wearing street clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was almost deserted , and then got into an elevator . About an hour later , the Lindsay party reappeared , having not only dined but changed into evening clothes . The Mayor had on black tie , Mrs. Lindsay was wearing a long light-blue gown , their daughters , too , were in formal dresses , and John , Jr. , wore a navy-blue suit . We buttonholed Mr. Lindsay for a few minutes and asked him how he was holding up . " I 'm managing to enjoy it , in spite of everything , " he told us . " Last night , you know , I was working on the speech . Then , last night  --  disaster ! I slept a little , and then got up today and worked some more , and then , at noon  --  again disaster ! But I managed to finish the speech by about three o'clock today . " He grinned , and we wished him luck as he went to join his party outside the hotel , where two limousines were waiting . In another hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaugural ball in New York City 's history was just beginning , in the mammoth Imperial Ballroom , on the second floor . Swarms of people were mounting two stairways to the ballroom as the Meyer Davis orchestra played " On the Street INrhere You Live , " followed by " People . " At eleven o'clock , the Lindsays arrived , and there were waves of applause as they tried to advance through a tremendous crowd . " John ! John ! " people cried , and " Mary ! Mary ! " Mr. and Mrs. Lindsay were jostled and swept through the crowd toward the handstand , where Lionel Hampton 's hand , which had replaced Meyer Davis 's , was playing " Oh , Johnny ! " Smiling broadly , Mr. Lindsay managed to grasp most of the hands that were extended to him , saying " Hello ! How are you ? Nice to sec you again ! Happy New Year ! " Mrs. Lindsay clutched a small headed bag in one hand and looked courageous as she was shoved and buffeted , and Mr. Lindsay put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , Jr. , riding on someone 's shoulder . When the Mayor and his family reached the handstand , they were lifted , or otherwise propelled , onto the platform , and Mr. Lindsay threw an arm about Mr. Hampton . " No speech , " Mr. Lindsay said into a microphone , his smile intact . " I just want to give my thanks to all of you who have allowed yourselves to he compressed into this condition . My thanks to all those who are providing entertainment for us tonight . My thanks to all of you . And my thanks to the City of New York . "
