WALKING WOUNDED a story by John Bart Gerald We have a very gutsy chaplain on our base . It was Sunday morning in one of our little Air Force churches with thin walls and runty steeples so they wo n't scrape the bellies of planes coming in too low , and the chaplain , a major , was up there entertaining us . Chaplains are always more entertaining than civilian preachers . For one thing they have a sense of humor about themselves . Now our chaplain was making jokes about hawks and doves , I ca n't remember them exactly because I 'm not very political . But he was making everyone in that church nervous , from airman basic to the commander who sat in the front row with his wife . My own wife was giggling because she hates the war like sin and only understood the jokes on her own side . But when everyone was feeling uncomfortable , the major leaned over with the Bible open in his two large hands and said , " Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows . " You better believe it . I slipped my fingers through the buttons of my shirt and held the cool metal of my dog tags against my heart . My own name is Dunbar and the three stripes on my sleeve feed my wife and the baby . I do n't like war . But I do n't hate it either . The way I see it everything 's a fight . The little creatures war on each other ; when I was little I used to shoot robins and stuff them back between the rocks of the old silo foundation  --  until my father caught me because they smelled so had . So I know myself . I know what I am . That does n't mean I 'm glad , which is why I 'm a medical specialist instead of a load master . Of course the war hurts me , There 's a lot of difference between killing robins and people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy told me this story . " Palletti and me were standing in the middle of the street after our squad went through this village when a slope woman comes up to me and knocks her hands together . " Boom-boom , " she says . She points to her but and says , " Boom-boom . " So I laugh and jiggle my balls and follow her back to her hut ; only as she goes in I watch her step over a wire across her door . I just turn around and walk back to Palletti . But she comes out after me and tugs at my arm saying , " Boom-boom , boom-boom . " Her dress was open . I pushed her off and shot her up the front . Then I took off a grenade and rolled it smooth through the door of her but and it blew out two kids . I did n't mind the woman so much . " Now I 've never forgotten that story but to be honest , when I think of it now it sort of bores me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV if you finish supper too early , and I have too many stories . But at the time I walked off the ward and drank my coffee down in the basement with my hand shaking . And I suppose if I had been any younger I would have cried out at God . I hated the war and did n't want anything to do with it . But just as I was getting off my twelve-hour shift , the lieutenant asked me if I could report for parade duty . And that was no question . So I drove home and changed , and there I was dead on my feet out in the middle of the airfield . Music whispered out to us from near the grandstands , echoing off transport planes , while we checked our buttons , our shaves , the set of our caps . grumbling before we made the turn , some guys still palming their cigarettes and my own belt cutting into my gut . The stands were filled with patches of greens and pinks , women and kids in Sunday best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder , the ranks sharpening around me , setting our shoulders , digging our heels into the pavement , feeling out our places in the block so we would n't stand out wrong , and my own foot hitting right with the 46 WALKING WOUNDED beat of the bass drum . The brass thumped in our gas , there was a lot of high snappy razzing as the reviewing stand loomed up . The " Eyes Right " went off like a shot  --  our heads all snapped together . And there was some general I 've never seen a picture of , and the women . But we were off down the landing strip with every guy 's heel splitting the second , our arms together and eyes straight ahead , until the music began to fade with the strong breeze and a kind of life went out of us in a long breath . You see the military is n't so different from any kind of work , except sucking around does n't help you get ahead so much . In fact the way I see it , everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . You make scratch or you get rubbed out . We 're all part of one great machine . So I feel a little ahead of a lot of people who do n't see that yet . Which is why on Sunday morning I leave my pajamas on the bathroom floor and sit on the toilet lid polishing my low shoes with spit and bits of toilet paper . I put on a clean blue shirt which cuts into my neck . My blues only fit when I joined six years ago , before I started drinking . I close my pants . I button the four insignia buttons up my front staring in the mirror at the yellow-and-red good-conduct ribbon which could be pinned to my skin  --  as Marsha once said in bed . And polishing my visor , we start off to church . But someday I will breathe in deep and burst the buttons off my chest and split the zipper and rip the stripes and all that goddam blue stuff off my body and stand out there on the flight line naked before all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a guy once on the wards whose legs were full of metal and pus , with a fever of a hundred and four . He kept showing me a dirty scrap of paper with the words on it he wanted for his stone : As here I lie So must you be . Look straight ahead And follow me . But he was gone the next day and I never found out whether he lived or died . There 's no loose brass around that late , no chickenshit , just the medical busses and ambulances lined up at the edge of the dark . I do n't really mind sitting out there in the dead of night . I clear myself a space in the litter stays on the bus floor , or , if I can , take the warm place on top of the heating unit thrumming away , while we wait . I talk some , doze , look out at silhouettes of the huge cargo planes and the runway flat out into the night . Way out there on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm safe here with my wife and kid . When the plane lands we roll out to pick up the cargo . There are n't any windows so when the back of the plane drops away from under the tail , light spills into the fresh air like a wound opening . We back right in and walk out into the plane 's belly . Stretchers are stacked from top to bottom and past them the walking wounded stare out at us , looking for home . We let the flight medics take down the litters one at a time and put them on the tailgate . Then we pick them up and stack them two or three high along each side of the bus . I could direct it in my sleep . One two three lift with the litter , keeping it level , always careful where I put my feet because the only wrong I can do is drop one . And lose my stripes . Still I could do it in my sleep . Though before I lift I look into the man 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . As for the guys themselves , I would n't fight them in a bar . After battle they should n't look like kids anymore , like half-time at a football game , sweating . Wounded without beards . I do n't get used to that . I also look in their faces for pain because sometimes they have pieces of metal in their bodies and it hurts them to move . I 'm careful with the guys who still feel anything . Sometimes a man 's face does something very private and I do n't look at him anymore . That night they brought out a Marine lieutenant  --  I could hear him crying back in the stomach of the plane . He was on the tailgate breathing hard , arms and shoulders naked under a light blanket while we stood over him in our parkas . And he said , " Wait a minute , let 's wait a minute , " because he did n't want us to move him . But a lot more guys had to come out . " Sorry to be such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the noises in my bones . I jammed the John Bart Gerald 's novel " A Thousand Thousand Mornings " was issued in 1964 bg Viking . He is a medic in the Air Force Reserve , where he has worked with Vietnam casualties . A Harvard graduate , born in 1940 , he lives in Manhattan . litter handle into the wall clasp and locked it . The lieutenant screamed . I did n't mean to jolt him but I was sweating . I knew the guy too well . He said , " You boys make it hard for a man to be a hero . " Because of his sounds the bus moved out extra slow over the pavement . Some officer was up front welcoming the troops home in the name of the Air Force , the base commander , the squadron , telling them where they were and what time it was . The guys lay there listening to the bullshit up front and the Marine 's noises in the back , making peace in their own little worlds , running fingers over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , or staring up at white pant legs in the aisle and swaying bottles of dextrose . Some just lay there staring straight up at the green canvas of the litter overhead as though they were scared the guy 's blood would seep through and drip on them . I always look at their faces . I ca n't stop looking at their faces . At one time I thought I was looking for guys I knew . Or I was curious what a face looked like , forty-eight hours after the kid 's blown up . Until on a drunk I was trying to remember what one of them looked like , just one , and all 1 could remember in that whole line of litters I 've been unloading was my own face , a story by John Bart Gerald 47 one after another on those green stretchers I take out of the guts of those planes . When the kid pulled my pant leg I crouched clown beside him . " Take the straps off me , Sarge , " he said , " 1 want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't want to take the straps off him . I 'd have to strap him down again for unloading . And I did n't know what his wound was . I 've learned not to look . I saw there was only enough bulk for one leg under his blanket so I gave him a cigarette . We smoked . At first wounded guys are like anyone , before they learn to live with their wounds , use mechanical limbs or change their own bags . Because they really are n't any different . Until we look at them too much , or look away . Or they know we 're afraid to look under the covers . But the kid did n't realize that yet . I told him he did n't want to look outside anyway because it was dark and looked like any other air base with the grass turning yellow because we were going into winter . There was miles and miles of concrete empty as the shopping center on Sunday afternoon . Though I knew that was n't much to tell a man he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good BX and you could get stereo sets there now and tape recorders at a big discount . And every day we had a happy hour over at the NCO TREE by Lenore Marshall They were felling the dead tree . It was necessary . On the hard ground Men stamped and clapped for warmth . Wind . otherwise , hurling against old rot The winter wind at unresisting rot Would knock the neighbor beeches headlong with it . The man in red-plaid coat secured a cable The man , blue-hooded , hacked a deeper notch . Men stamped and clapped for warmth and tied the noose . It was all familiar . Cold air , frozen earth , The patch of woods , familiar , and the crack Of axe , the buzz of saw ; it was necessary . Hacked branches lay there first . It was a cold day . Men shouted . A woman came and stood . It was all familiar . There was a splintering There was a crack and crash . Men leapt and laughed , the woman shuddered . There was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs stiffened in the air , And unfamiliar . 48 WALKING WOUNDED club , which my wife said was how I got my gut . And there was a color TV set on the ward . When they first come off the plane some of them ask to be set down so they can feel American soil again . They do n't think about the concrete . But this kid was black as ashes and that made it harder to explain what was out there . I did n't know why I was telling him anyway so I stopped . You really come home to your own people . All I know is I go borne to ifarsha just waking up or if she 's up I watch her feeding the baby . And that 's a good thing , I do n't care what anybody thinks . Maybe because I was silent the kid said , " They sending you over , Sarge ? " When I thought of that I felt the fire was spreading through the middle of my own life too , and Marsha was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ? " You going if they send you ? " said the kid . I was quiet . It 's not the kind of question you ask in the service . At one time or another every guy thinks of not going , but he wo n't admit it . Unless he 's a fool . So 1 just looked at the kid thinking you ca n't tell with colored guys , and sorry I gave him a cigarette . After all , I 've always loved my country . I guess I still love her , right or wrong , because a lot of her 's wrong . I 've seen that many guys shot up for nothing . Fur officers who said it 's necessary , it 's necessary . And sometimes it was necessary to cut off a leg . I tried to smile at the kid . He did n't smile back . He rolled his head on the white pillow and said , " Do n't go , man . " Why was he telling me ? He said it again and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't go , " he kept saying . Until I realized that was what he had to tell me , like the other guys had their war stories , it was the only thing he knew anymore . But I did n't want the kid to think that with only one leg . And I did n't want him to say it out loud because he could get into trouble . And I guess I did n't want to hear him , so I stood up . The Marine was crying . The bus joggled down the uneven road and everyone had to listen . Two medics were trying to hold his litter steady but it did n't help . And we do n't carry drugs on the bus . And anyway you can never be sure with guys like that , they might just be screaming for an extra shot . Only I could n't ignore it . I was sweating again . The kid pulled my pant leg so I squatted down and said , " You take it easy , soldier . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no ears . I said I heard him and it was tough . " But it 's not so tough . " " I 'll tell him that , " I said , sick of this kid . " No , listen in , " he said , holding his black hand in the air as though he could catch the sound . I watched his hand move . I could have bashed his head in for conducting his own band . Until I listened to the lieutenant . They were regular even cries like someone remembering screams from long ago . Or someone trying them on , waiting for something worse . The guy did n't really believe in his own screams . Because the pain was there but the real pain was that it did n't hurt yet . It did n't hurt enough . And that was scaring . I saw why it cut into me so bad . We hit a crack and the marine screamed again loud . And I can still hear it . But if I let it get to my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get efficient . Maybe that 's my training . I pushed the cart down the long waxed corridor to Ward 4 , then down past the isolation rooms to open bay and squared the litter longside the bed . Sometimes the guys can move over themselves , but for him I had to bring two medics in for help . We hung the bottle up by his bed . I untied the bag of urine . One pulled the blanket where the guy was all right up top but from his stomach down was wrapped in old bandages . We had to lift all of him at once . Ignoring the smell I slipped both arms under his legs , the warm bandages soaked through on my skin . When we started to lift my hands sunk up into the gauze letting out the smell as something trickled into the bends of my arms . But I kept telling the guy it was all right until he was on the bed . When I took the cart out to the stack of litters and peeled aft the yellow sheet , pus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still with me . I try to explain that smell to my wife but I never can , It 's too strong to really breathe so you do n't get used to it . It smells like hat urine , or milk gone sour . Like dead birds or something stinking up the foundation . A lot of guys smell because they 're dressed just off the battlefield , and it takes an anesthetic to change some bandages . So for a while the sickness in there just gets older and older . I washed up in the utility room and rinsed with a handful of alcohol swabs , before I went out for the next . When the busses were unloaded and the ward full , I took a cup of coffee and watched the Red Cross lady ask each guy where he was from and did he want to call home free . Each did , so she brought the phone stand around and stood listening , smiling while the guy said yeah Mom I 'm okay . The doctor and nurse came through and I got my assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a fifty-fifty chance , the doctor thought . If someone looks like he 's really going to die we move him to another ward . I looked in at his door and the man was sitting there cranked halfway up in bed with no shirt on but his bandages and a sheet over his legs . There were lines of sweat running between the bandages . His temperature was too high . I went to the utility room to wash up and brought back the dressing cart . " Hello , bright eyes . " the man said . I started to tell him just what I was going to do with the dressing cart but he said just go ahead and do it . So I broke out the sterile towelsto speak but he tried , his skids parted the were flying that low Charlie could n't see you to shoot , until he came all of a sudden on a clearing with a lot of people and cows . I broke open one of the disposable suture sets and put on gloves , which are about the thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old dressing with just a little pull so the man broke sentence , and then picked it right up again . Someone fired a shot at him so he angled off and came in over the horns of the cattle with his guns open . And if he felt bad about it I was n't really listening . I did another wound , then another , until the bandages were all off the guy 's chest and he was sitting there with a line of holes up his side and across under his tit filled with yellow packing . And I thought of changing that too but it was in pretty tight . and the petty officer said he 'd just as soon kill me if I touched those . So I asked him how come he caught shrapnel when he was supposed to be up in a helicopter . Then I cleaned what I could with normal saline , dressed the wounds with clean stuff and started on the guy 's legs , while he sat there , his face gleaming with sweat , his body burning up under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the next barstool at the NCO club , circling around the cows and the little people . Back on the ward the colored kid had found some crutches and was trying to make the TV set work , but it was only five in the morning and nothing much was on . So he stood in the middle of the ward and hopped around flapping his crutches like a stork for anyone who cared 50 WALKING WOUNDED to watch him . " Goddam , " he said to me , " you ever see a one-legged nigger dance ? " One guy had a leg cast up over his hip and a little hatch in the cast like a manhole cover , right in the middle of his thigh . There was a neat circle filled with red meat and a slit in that . The swab went into the leg all of five inches , disappeared down into that hole and came out again yellow . And all the while the guy just sat there looking very cool with a little black moustache over his smirk . Then another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clean work and I considered myself lucky because there was a man down the way who had put a gun under his chin and the whole lower half of his face was missing . I finished breakfast early . I did n't go straight back to the ward , they put you right to work . Some nights when the load is light we take turns sleeping in the linen room and the morning does n't hit so bad . I walked into the ambulatory ward where the men were just getting up . The TV was off ; I slumped in a chair facing the dead tube . The sky was burning pale clear blue out past the window . Marsha and I were nestled in some warm green hollow with sunlight filtering in through the grass . Something very good was about to happen to us . I was listening to a detailed explanation of shooting elephants with a bazooka . I opened my eyes . I looked at the kid , husky , crew-cut , with the new-type combat boots . He was in good shape so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " He turned to look at me and held down his hand . The shaking started at the elbow . " Nerves , " he said . He was a psychiatric patient . I looked hard at his natural blue eyes not so different from the sky staring back at mine . " I could have killed the guy who woke me . I do n't know how I 'm going to wake up , " he said . I figured if he was that violent they would have him in restraints . " You 're doing all right , " I said . " No , " he said . " I hate too much . " Well , I pushed down in my chair and shut my eyes again . " Hate , " I said , " is no simple thing . " " You were n't there , " said the kid . I was sorry I said anything . " We used to bring back ears . " " Yes I 've heard that , " I said . As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't walk into the clearing , " the kid said , " and see our guys hung up by their feet . They were all dead , except one , because theyhung there all night , There was blood all down their stomachs . And I looked at the one guy for about a minute before I understood what they did to him . Charlie cut the things off and stuffed them in his mouth , and ragged his mouth to keep them there . The sergeant told me to cut him down . The name stenciled on his fatigues was Henderson , I never saw him before . A couple of my buddies held him and I cut him down . He lay on the ground opening and closing his eyes , I would n't touch him . The corpsman took the things out of his mouth and the guy said , ' Kill me , just shoot me , ' with the blood dried on his teeth . I got sick . Our sergeant said go over the other side of the clearing . I turned my back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any peace . " Well I got to get back to work , " I said and stood up . I only had an hour more anyway . The psychiatric patient said , " Yeah , I 'm sorry , " and put out his hand , trembling . I shook hands with him and walked back to my ward . I guess I felt a little sorry for the guy . His story was such an old story they probably told it in basic to scare the new recruits . Or he read it somewhere . But I knew the kid must have done something nasty to be pushing it around as his own , that kid with his body still whole and strong . His body was still whole and strong . That means a lot where I work . When I got back to the project the baby was still asleep and Marsha in bed . I undressed . My whites had yellow stains on the front so I stuffed them in the laundry bag . Then I washed and climbed into bed . I lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and put her leg over mine , and put her head against my neck while I stared up at the ceiling . I was n't ready for sleep . " Do you want a drink ? " she said . I shook my head . She put her hand up behind my neck and we lay there . I looked at her black hair and soft skin , but I did n't feel anything . I put my hands on her shoulders and then along her sides and lifted her . She brought my head into her breasts . But I did n't feel a thing . I put my hands around her breasts . I pressed her around my face , And I held on for dear life . But I was n't there . I was breathing in the smell of old wounds . Until I put my palms against my face and realized where the smell came from . As though the wounds had become part of my own skin . I took my hands away and sat up on the edge of the bed , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I have left . I am alive , I 'm breathing .
