In a paddyfield far out in the Dominican countryside , a bare-chested campesino whipped his straining oxen . " Go , you lovelies ! " he cried . " Get up , you bastards ! " Across the rich corn and platano fields of the Cibao Valley , fair-skinned , barefoot women toted gourds from roadside fountains to their thatched shacks , while nearby mounds of rice lay drying in the sun . In the mountains to the north , a grizzled farmer , Vicente Santiago , 65 , worried his head over his ten children , his ten hens , his three acres of coffee , platano and corn-and little else . If there was trouble in Santo Domingo , it was of no concern to him . " The governments in the capital do not mean anything to us , " said he . " No matter what changes there , everything is the same to us here . " <P> The old farmer reflected a curious detachment in the Dominican Republic four months after the abortive revolution . To the people of the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mars . What concerned them most was the sorry shape of the sugar , cocoa and coffee markets , the absence of rain , the shortage of food , the need to get pencils and books for the kids returning to school-in short , the same things that concerned them before Santo Domingo erupted . <P> The mood of disengagement was even more pronounced in the republic 's second city , Santiago ( pop . 75,000 ) . There , last week , the movie houses were packed , and a chic fashion show drew a capacity crowd . Well-stocked shops were doing a bustling business , Rotarians held their regular dinner at the downtown Hotel Mercedes , the local civic band played its customary Sunday-afternoon concert in the park , and the binational Dominican-American Center held its usual graduation ceremony for the students who had been learning English . <P> Economy Damage . For all this appearance of detachment , the little republic was beginning to feel a deeper deterioration of the already troubled economy . The revolt closed major banks in Santo Domingo 's rebel zone , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peso shortage cut down business outlays and salaries , and government tax collections dropped from $15 million to $5 million a month . To help out , the U.S. is putting cash in the hands of laborers through $6,416,000 in emergency grants for road and irrigation projects . That is at best a stopgap move . The country , which barely got through with a gross national product of $824 million in 1964 , will probably end up with a G.N.P . for 1965 of $700 million . <P> <P> It was in Santo Domingo , of course , that the damage was most evident . Day by day , the civilian population there was growing more restive , and the pressures for settlement increased . Last week , a group of top capital businessmen petitioned Chief OAS Mediator Ambassador Ellsworth T. Bunker to press for an end to the " deterioration of all our activities , economic as well as educational and civic . " <P>
