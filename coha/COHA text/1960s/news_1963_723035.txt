txt President Kennedy plans to cut about $500,000,000 from his foreign aid budget estimate of $4,900,000,000 , it was learned today . The President has instructed foreign aid officials to give the fullest possible effect to recommendations of the study group headed by Gen. Lucius D. Clay for a more concentrated program tied more closely to United States security requirements . The Foreign Aid Review Committee reported to the , President over the weekend that the United States was trying to do " too much for too many " and should start immediate diplomatic negotiations to reduce aid to some countries and cancel it completely to some others . Savings Contemplated By tightening the administration of aid programs to eliminate projects designed to keep political regimes in power , forestall Soviet aid and show our estdem for certain foreign heads of state , the committee estimated that as much as $500 , - 000,000 might have been saved during the current year . It did not suggest that these criteria could be applied at any particular time and proposed that a real effort be made toward their realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal , however , was to persuade many supporters of the aid program in Congress of the need for a big cut in the President 's original estimate . The President 's present purpose is to prevent any further snowballing of this cutback psychology by cutting his own original estimate to $4,400,000,000 if possible or to $4,500,000,000 as a ceiling . Humphrey Sees Cuts The President 's purpose was foreshadowed earlier in the day when Senator Hubert H. Humphrey , the assistant majority leader , said after a White House conference of legislative leaders that he planned to send a special foreign aid message to Congress next Tuesday cutting his budget estimate by an amount " honestly attributable " to the Clay report . The Minnesota Senator added that " on the basis of the Clay report , it is my view that it will be necessary to make some reductions in foreign aid . " He said " this report fortifies some of the doubts members of Congress have had about the program . " Actually , any such " honestly attributable " reduction in the President 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone can decide what commitments to which countries can or should . be phased , down or out . Foreign a i d administrator David . E. Bell , who- will help decide the pace of carrying out the ' Clay committee 's recommendations , expressed general agreement today with the group 's findings . " The judgments , policies and attitudes that they , express are sound , appropriate and propier , " , Mr. Bell ' told a meeting of the Magazine Publishers . Association . " We do not have any substantial difference of judgments on the main line of the committee 's . policy recommendations . " But the foreign aid chief noted that the group had suggested the possibility that larger ? expenditures might be required for programs in India and Latin America during the year ahead , and he added : " There is no basis to derive any judgment on what they think of the budget request that President Kennedy is making . " It was clear from Mr. Bell 's explanation of his foreign aid philosophy that the Agency for International Development already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clay report . He emphasized - the following approaches to aid under his administration : II All country programs must include a foreseeable terminal date , a point at which their own economic momentum can be sustained without outside help . gAll programs must give effect to the principle that outside assistance is a marginal requirement and that attainment of economic self-reliance has to be the work of the in- , dividual country by initiating necessary reforms in budget and fiscal systems , land tenure and similar actions . CUltimately , the job of developing underdeveloped countries must be the responsibility of private capital and private enterprise of the donor and developing nations . Government resources are not adequate for the purpose . On the first point , Mr. Bell said three countries , Greece , Israel and Nationalist China soon would be on top of their economic problem and would be independent of United States aid . Others like Libya , Venezuela and Saudi Arabia would be in a position , to help themselves without United States aid because of their rich oil resources . Other nations ? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? would need five or 10 years or more to become economically self-supporting . He cited Brazil as an illustration of a country " where we are trying to help them acquire an understanding of their economic problem . " The recent United StatesBrazil aid agreement was described by the aid official as 1 a " short-run anti-inflation program . "
