txt The General Motors Corporation announced today the recall of 1,133,720 cars , ? trucks and school buses for correction of potential safety defects in the braking system . General Motors said at least one death was connected to the callback , that of a 15-year-old boy in a school bus accident in Huntsville , Ala. , Nov. 19 . There have been other accidents and injuries but the injuries reported to the company were not major , a General Motors public relations man said . The campaign comes only weeks after General Motors recalled 4.9 million vehicles , most of them Chevrolet cars , for safety defects linked to at least four deaths . In the latest G.M. recall , as in last month 's , all the vehicles are to be repaired  --  rather than merely inspected and repaired if a defect is noticed , which was the old auto company practice . Coming on top of the 4.9 million recall , it means that General Motors dealer facilities are likely to be jammed with vehicles needing repair over the next year and customers may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealership to have the corrections made . The recall of the following was announced today : ? 11967,000 full-size 1965 and 1966 Pontiac cars , the entire . model run for both years in the big Pontiacs. 41164,050 Chevrolet and GMC truck and coach division bus chassis and medium-duty trucks ? 1967 , 1968 and 1969 models . 411,450 Chevrolet and 590 GMC four-wheel-drive lightduty trucks 1969 models . l630 heavy-duty GMC highway tractors-1967 , 1968 and 1969 models . In the Pontiac defect , G. M. said , two front brake hoses may fail . " Field experience , " which means complaints from owners , " indicated that after extended mileage under certain driving conditions it is possible that fatigue failure can occur in the hoses . This would permit eventual loss of brake fluid with resulting loss of braking . However , the mechanical emergency braking system is not affected , " General Motors said . The braking systems involved are hydraulic  --  they depend on fluid pressure to work . If the brake fluid leaks , a driver may step on his brakes and find his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stopping . It may happen without warning . The brakes may work well one moment and are completely gone the next . ' ? The mechanical brakes G.M. mentioned are the parking , or emergency , or hand brakes . While they stop the car , there often are moments of shock for any driver before he remembers to try to stop his vehicle with a hand brake . General Motors did not say what " extended mileage " meant , but said the lowest-mileage Pontiac with the problem had gone 20,000 miles . On the 164,050 trucks and buses , General Motors said it had reports " that the hydraulic braking system on the vehicle involved , in a few cases under certain driving conditions , has not functioned properly or has failed . " The reports indicate , G.M. said , that " steady brake pedal application for gradual deceleration may permit brake fluid to pass the primary seal and thereby prevent total braking action . " General Motors said it could not find an actual defect in the system despite these reports . " Extensive laboratory tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " However , in the interest of safety , a new seal will be installed . " Linked to Death General Motors said the death in Huntsville was linked to this problem . It said it had a report of a second school bus accident connected to the problem , in Lansing , Mich. , but the only injury there was a cut on the driver 's foot , according to G.M. The 1969 four - wheel - drive vehicles  --  these are light trucks for rough-road or off-the-road driving ? " may have a front brake drum distortion caused by wheel interference which could eventually result in weakening and cracking of the wheel disc , ' General Motors said . A driver would be warned of the problem because of a " pulsating brake pedal " when he stepped on the brakes . G.M. said it had no reports of wheel failures but would replace the wheels on all the trucks affected . The heavy - duty tractors ? these are the short , powerful truck cabs that pull large highway vans  --  are to he brought hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to prevent possible chafing on the left front tire during full right turns , which could cause rupture of the hose and loss of brake action .
