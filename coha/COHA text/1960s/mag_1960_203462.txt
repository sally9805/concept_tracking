" These things , " said Manuel Ycaza , " are beneath the dignity of a man whose family has a coat of arms . " The things that Jockey Ycaza ( pronounced ee-kah-za ) was talking about were the tactics that once won him the reputation of racing 's roughest rider . But Ycaza , at 22 , is already a reformed fellow . And though he is calmly vague about the details of his coat of arms ( asked what it is , he replies : " Why , it is a coat of arms for the Ycaza family " ) , many a follower of the new Ycaza might suggest that it be a whip rampant on a field of winning $2 tickets . <P> Every Trick in the Book . One of nine children born to a Panamanian bus driver , Ycaza learned to ride ponies as a six-year-old , trained as a jockey in Panama and Mexico . Says his agent : " They 're not strict down there . Everybody rides rough . " In the U.S. , Ycaza quickly endeared himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a donkey-if only because he was more than willing to try every breakneck , hot-headed trick in the books . In 1957 track stewards grounded Ycaza for 130 days for fouls ; in 1958 he was ordered out of the saddle for 110 days . From 1958 came the memorable picture of Ycaza , riding Jewel 's Reward in Hialeah 's Flamingo Stakes , and coming down the stretch bumping Rival Tim Tarn . Ycaza was suspended for 15 days , Jewel 's Reward was disqualified at a cost of $77,800 to Owner Elizabeth Arden Graham , and Tim Tam went on to win the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness . It was at about that point that trainers began shrugging Ycaza off as a foolish kid who let a hot temper cancel out cold talent . <P> But in 1959 , Owner Harry F. Guggenheim of Cain Hoy Stable gave Ycaza a chance to redeem himself by hiring him as contract rider . Ycaza liked Cain Hoy . " It is like a family stable , " he says . " They are all very nice to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wished to improve , " says Ycaza . " To wish is a big thing . " It was certainly a big thing to Cain Hoy-the U.S. 's leading money-winning stable last year , with purses totaling $742,081 . <P> Holding Onto It . This year Ycaza has taken his place among the nation 's best jockeys . A leader at Florida 's Gulfstream Park , he recently flew to New York , got socked out by weather , finally landed and got to Aqueduct just 55 minutes before the day 's feature race . He pulled on his silks just in time to mount and ride Mommy Dear to a win in the $28,050 Correction Handicap . Last week he had five winners in three days at Aqueduct-and not one of his rides was beneath the dignity of a man with a family coat of arms . Says Ycaza : " I used to want to win so much that I got excited when anything interfered , and I would lose my temper . Now I still have the same temper , but I know I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
