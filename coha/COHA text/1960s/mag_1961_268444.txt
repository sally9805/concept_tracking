Cold Wind in August ( Troy ; Aidart ) , a rutty melodrama about a thirtyish stripteaser ( Lola Albright ) who falls in love with a 17-year-old janitor 's son ( Scott Marlowe ) , does not merely invite cynicism , it drags cynicism in off the street and loosens its tie . Obviously , the film will be a financial success , because it is loaded with skin-on-skin sex . No cynicism here , nor in the observation that part of the film 's distinct , if flawed , artistic success is due to a tight budget . <P> What curdles the viewer 's admiration is the suspicion that the film also profits by its lack of clever camerawork , imaginative direction ( Alexander Singer , a former producer of television commercials , is responsible ) or well-plotted story . In this almost total vacuum , there is nothing at all to get in the way of a superb job by Lola Albright , a 37-year-old blonde known chiefly for having played Peter Gunn 's girl friend on TV , and a performance almost as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parts-she has had three bad marriages and knows the wild luck of her new affair ; he thinks this sort of thing will continue for the rest of his life . The cardboard plot grinds on to the boy 's inevitable discovery of what his true love does for a living . When they break up , her grief is touching , and so is his ignorance . It should be added that Writer Burton Wohl 's dialogue is excellent , even though his story is deficient . The lines have the unlovely clack of reality , and hearing Actors Albright and Marlowe say them is closer to hiding under the sofa than anything else in films this summer .
