txt The Federal Reserve Board raised its basic lending rate , the discount rate , to 5 per cent from 41/2 per cent today " to strengthen the international position of the dollar and to curb inflationary pressure in the domestic economy . " The action came after a record-breaking gold-buying rush abroad . Shortly after the Federal Reserve announcement , the British Government announced that financial markets , including the London gold market , would be closed tomorrow pending an international meeting in Washington Saturday . Canada increased her bank rate to 71/2 per cent from 7 per cent and Finance Minister Mitchell Sharp asked a suspension of gold trading in Canada for Friday , The Canadian Press reported . Statement by Officials The Secretary of the Treasury , Henry H. Fowler , and the Federal Reserve chairman , William McChesney Martin , said in a statement tonight that closing of the London markets " does not affect the United States undertaking to buy and , sell gold in transactions with monetary authorities at the official price of $35 an ounce . " 1 They said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six other nations participating in the London gold pool to the Washington meeting " to consult with us on co ordinated measures to insure orderly conditions in the exchange markets and to support the present pattern of exchange rates among currencies based on the fixed price of $35 an ounce of gold . " Today 's discount rate increase , approved unanimously by the seven-man Federal Reserve Board , was less than many observers and bankers had expected . But it brought the discount rate , as the Federal Reserve noted , to the highest level " in nearly four decades . " The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was not among the ministers most closely concerned with the crisis . The meeting lasted . 80 minutes , breaking up at 2:30 A.M. A half hour later , Mr. Jenkins appeared in the House of Commons , which was sitting late on other business , to make a statement on the action taken in the monetary crisis . He announced the request from Washington to halt gold dealing for one day and added : " In doing so it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market does not affect United States undertakings to buy and sell gold at the official price of $35 an ounce . " He said Sir Leslie would fly . to Washington later today and that " we are arranging for a representative of the Treasury to be made available in ' Washington for consultations over the period of the meeting . " The Government has been in close touch with the United States authorities whose objective , Mr. Jenkins said , is to secure time in which to make arrangements to enable markets to resume business in an orderly way after the weekend . House Filled The House filled quickly when it became known that the chancellor was about to speak . After his statement , Labor members roared " shame " and " disgraceful " when Edward Heath , the Conservative leader talluded to " the consequences of devaluation " in asking for an assurance that the domestic banking system " remains absolutely unimpaired . " Mr. Jenkins offered his " fullest assurances " that this was so and told another questioner that the latest developments would not alter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Jenkins said in reply to a further question : " I detect no panic in any quarters and it is highly desirable that through constructive meetings in Washington greater order can prevail in the next few days . " In London , the main market through which the gold is pouring out to speculators and other private buyers , dealers were overwhelmed yesterday . Insiders spoke of " panic . " The volume in London was estimated at more than 200 tons , a record . No exact figures ever are given by officials , but there was no attempt to conceal that fact that . demand was still rising after two weeks of the latest gold rush . , Two hundred tons would be worth $224-million . Few European bankers or government experts think the gold can pour out of the reserves at that rate for long without damaging the international trading structure . The United States supplies 60 per cent of the gold for the London market . American gold reserves now total about $11.6-billion . London Is Key Elsewhere In Europe , secondary markets trade gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demand in these other markets , while indicative of the height of the fever , does not add to the London total drawn from reserves . In Paris , where buying has been especially feverish , the volume reached another peak today of 45 tons ? more than double Wednesday 's record . Dealers were swamped by orders . In Zurich , the three leading banks had to close their gold trading offices early because they could not handle the orders . And reports from Hong Kong , Brussels , Toronto and elsewhere spoke of unusual goldbuying by small and large speculators . They all wanted to get in on the gamble that the United States . will be forced to raise the price of gold . What is at stake is the convertibility of gold into dollars at therate of $35 an ounce . That exchange rate , fixed by the United States in 1934 , is the basis of all world trade . Dollars , in the vernacular , have been as good as gold at that price . Effect on Dollar The speculators are now buying gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , it will be forced to raise the price of gold . But that could have incalculable effects on the use of the dollar as the world 's main trading currency . It is the uncertainty underlying the crisis that has the European financial community ; ;  - -   - -  and the politicians  --  so frightened . No one can he sure what a final loss of confidence in the dollar could mean . It might , if countries were less willing to Hold dollars as their reserves and for trading purposes , undermine world trade and start a monumental depression . The universal feeling ONpressed in informed circles here and on the Continent is that the United States must act to stop what The Financial Times last night called the Istampede . " Drastic steps to deflate the American economy are regarded as essential here .
