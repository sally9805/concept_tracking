txt Confrontation route The bumping of Soviet and United States ships in the Sea of Japan on two occasions within a week may have a significance all along the route to Haiphong . This is the sea lane in which the Soviet Union ships war materiel to North Vietnam . Haiphong , where Russian ships unload , is the harbor that Washington has been reported as considering mining . United Nations Secretary-General U Thant is worried about the possibility of a direct confrontation between the United States and China , but Washington is more concerned about the Soviet Union . The old-style " warning shot across the bow " translates into these times as Soviet destroyers sideswiping American destroyers in the Sea of Japan . When such sideswiping occurs on two successive days it is perfectly clear that a message is being conveyed . This is the sign language of power politics . - Notice has been given . It is not Moscow custom to spell out such messages in words . It is not necessary . The chronology is crystal clear . It goes as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and declares a policy of " increasing the pressure . " March 6 . Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin says new American pressures " . . . will be met with new efforts to put an end to it the Vietnam war . " International duty ' March 9 . Soviet President Podgorny says American escalation " will inevitably provoke corresponding new efforts . . by friendly countries in resisting American aggression . " March 10 . Soviet Party Chief Leonid I. Brezhnev says " the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are manifesting by deeds their solidarity with North Vietnam and the fighting Vietnamese people by giving them all needed aid . " April 24 . Mr. Brezhnev says the Soviet Union " will continue our international duty to struggling Vietnam and render it the necessary help . " May 12 . Mr. Brezhnev says : " Let the aggressors know ; embattled Vietnam will never remain without the assistance of true friends . Our reply has been and will be fully commensurate with the needs of an effective rebuff to the brazen imperialist interventionists . " In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision which was presumably taken in Moscow some time between the resumption of United States bombing on Feb. 13 and the beginning of the public warnings from Moscow on March 6 . Cheap weaponry The notice has been implemented by a continued steady flow of Soviet weapons to North Vietnam . One of the most effective is the 140 mm. rocket launcher which was first used south of the demilitarized zone against United States units on Feb. 27 . ( That date presumably puts the policy decision in Moscow back to somewhere close to Mr. Kosygin 's return to Moscow from London on Feb. 13 . The same weapon now has appeared in the Saigon area where it was first used on May 11 . There are two important things about this rocket . It is light in weight and it is very // *Soviets escalate power politics // cheap to produce . It costs the Soviets a negligible amount of money and raw materials to equip the Viet Cong with this weapon . This is the key to the new Vietnam situation which now confronts President Johnson at the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure ' on North Vietnam the time will come , hopefully before 1967 is over , when Hanoi will crack under the strain , abandon the effort to aid the Viet Cong , pull its troops back to the North , and allow Mr. Johnson to have a military victory . The Russians have presumably decided that at small cost to themselves they can frustrate Mr. Johnson . It is a reasonable presumption that this is precisely what they have set out to do . U Thant talks dourly about the world being in a preliminary stage of a third world war . Washington experts and politicians see the meaning in less global , but in some domestic American respects more painful , terms . Russian experts remember a speech made back in early Eisenhower times by then Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov . In that speech he observed to his colleagues of the Soviet Central Committee that American Democrats were defeated because they were held responsible for unleashing the Korean war . He added that Republicans won because they appeared , for a time , to be furthering an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after ' 68 ? The assumption here is that Moscow has chosen to have a " confrontation " with the United States over Vietnam which will be strictly limited in measures employed , and aimed at a limited objective . That objective will be to deprive Mr. Johnson of his Vietnam victory before November , 1968 . A corollary to the above would be that Moscow thinks , rightly or wrongly , that its clients in Vietnam will be able to get a better deal after 1968 in a peace settlement with Republicans than they could today with Mr. Johnson and the Democrats . To Washington strategists the immediate meaning is clear . Moscow has undoubtedly decided that there will be a step of escalation by their side to match each such step from Washington . And the destroyer episode conveyed a specific as well as a general warning . Washington has been talking of mining the Harbor of Haiphong . Russian ships carrying war supplies to Vietnam . normally sail from Vladivostok and unload at Haiphong . In other words , Moscow is probably playing this hand as carefuly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to think that Moscow desires , or intends , a confrontation with Washington which would even approach in danger or intensity the Cuban crisis . It is merely determined , as its leaders have repeatedly said , to give their clients in Vietnam " all the help necessary " to keep them in the field through November of 1968 . Which means that for Lyndon B. Johnson there is no bright prospect of getting the victory he has been planning for by his next election day .
