txt WASHINGTON , July ** deep livisiona over individuals and policies that exist in the Democratic and Republican parties will plainly appear at the Los Angeles and Chicago conventions , and then be glossed vier as much and as long as possible in the ? interest of getting their candidates elected . But , the deep livision in organized labor , which is - aced as the third political force in : his country , probably will not be : angible at either convention . Union leaders will play a larger role in the choice of the Democratic than the Republican ticket . Presilent Roosevelt 's 1944 order , that his preference of Harry S. Truman for the Vice-Presidential nomination first be " cleared with . Sidney Hillman , " with a change of names continues as a vital Democratic consideration . The spokesmen of the merged labor movement have indicated no disagreement over the policies they will urge for endorsement in both party platforms . And at both Los Angeles and Chicago the representatives of the A. F. L. C. I. 0 . will speak as the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations are undergoing severe interH nal stresses . This is described as a " crisis period " by observers whose competence in objective evaluation of labor affairs is recognized by the union leaders themselves . These observers are the source of the following account of the issues over job control and the rate of organization in which the industrial and craft unions in the merger are now hotly embroiled : In one camp are the industrial unions , most of them the power combination in the former C. I. 0. , exemplified by the United Auto Workers , the United Steelworkers and the International Union of Electrical Workers . Their top leader is Walter P. Reuther , as president of the Industrial Union Department of the A. F. L.-C . I. O. , composed ofl sixty-five unions with a membership of about six million . In the opposing camp are the building trades ( craft ) unions , the core of the former A. F. L. , who are represented in the merged organization by C. J. ( Neil ) Haggerty , president of its Building and Construetion Trades Department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over which membership gets the job of maintaining and operating Industrial plants after they have been constructed . The hope was that the 1955 merger of the two Iwings of organized labor would lead to a solution of this long-standing I controversy , but it appears to have attained a higher degree of irrita-1 I tion . Efforts to find methods of settlement have failed ; the , interunion compact against membership raiding is frequently violated ; and there are continuing boycotts by some unions of the goods produced by others . These internal conflicts have slowed the merger 's fundamental drive to organize unattached workers , and the unions now have a less proportionate share of the national work-force than ten years ago . Meanwhile the construction unions have drawn back from a peace formula the industrial unions proposed and thought was about to be accepted . In this formula enforceable arbitration of differences between the unions was to be the final step . And a further impediment to the solution is Reuther 's characteristically vigorous leadership of the effort to dispose of both the great problems of merged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this report , " suspicions by some partisans of President George Meany of the A. F. L.-C . I. O. that Reuther is a young man in a hurry to get Meany 's job have made it very difficult for the two leaders to work constructively together for any length of time * * * even though Meany 's primacy is secure as long as he wants it and Reuther knows it . " The best prospect of internal peace , so necessary to the economic as well as the political interests of the merged labor movement and to the unity which has special importance in a Presidential year , is seen by these observers in three developments . One is a series of talks which Haggerty is conducting between the contending groups . ( From time to time Meany meets with the committee of twelve to encourage progress ) . Another is a pilot project in Philadelphia , being worked out by Reuther 's I. U. D. , to anticipate and prevent jurisdictional conflicts over job rights in that area .
