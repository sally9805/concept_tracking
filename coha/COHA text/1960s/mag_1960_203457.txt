KUBITSCHEK 'S BRASILIA <P> I saw a great civilization rising on a plateau on the shores of a lake between the 15th and 20th parallels , a promised land of rich milk and honey blest . <P> - Joao Bosco ( 1815-88 ) , <P> Brasilia 's patron saint <P> AT the rate of one each 30 minutes , 2,333 trucks churned out of Rio de Janeiro and took the road west , their springs creaking under all the paraphernalia of bureaucracy , from swivel chairs to paper clips . In the wilderness of Brazil 's central plateau , planes touched down on a new , jet-length runway every two minutes with Tempelhof-like precision . This week , before a crowd of 200,000 , President Juscelino Kubitschek will officially move the Brazilian government into Brasilia , his $500 million new capital . Boasts Kubitschek : " We have turned our back on the sea and penetrated to the heartland of the nation . Now the people realize their strength . ' ' <P> Hang the Cost . Brasilia is a skyscraper city sprung metropolis-size from a broad plateau where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only solitude and a jaguar screaming in the night . " It was thrown up at a hang-the-cost speed that wrenched the whole country 's economy . Forty-five million cubic meters of red earth were ripped out by a $50 million army of machines . The final price tag will top Brazil 's annual budget . <P> On his visit in February . President Eisenhower was reminded of " our own decision many years ago to move the capital of our fledgling nation from Philadelphia . " But in the move to Washington in 1800 , only 126 bureaucrats made the trek by coach and horseback , while state papers went by ship . Brasilia will have 120,000 citizens next week and 500,000 within ten years . No new capital-Ankara , Canberra or New Delhi-compares with it for scope and speed . <P> Eyes West . Kubitschek 's critics dub him " Pharaoh Juscelino " because historians reach back for a comparison to the Pharaoh Amenhotep IV , who between 1375 and 1358 B.C. built the Egyptian capital of Akhetaton after deciding that Thebes was out of favor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , Brasilia might also be compared to St. Petersburg ( now Leningrad ) , erected on inhospitable marsh , at a cost of more than 30,000 lives , to gratify Peter the Great 's passion to open ingrown Russia to the Baltic and to Western influence . Kubitschek also looks west , but inwardly : he proposes to populate Brazil 's vast domain carved out by 17th century bandeirantes - half- savage frontiersmen-but never settled . In the world 's fifth largest country , he says , " enormous fertile lands are as empty as the Sahara , while millions of Brazilians live in penury , clinging like crabs to the crowded shoreline.
