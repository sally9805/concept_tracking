In the first five weeks after its publication , the Random House Dictionary of the English Language ( TIME , Sept. 30 ) sold more than 250,000 copies , began to appear on the bestseller lists , and is still going at a lively clip . At a time when the bestsellers tend to be largely composed of sexy stuff , this is indeed a phenomenal showing . <P> The explanation is relatively simple . For one thing , Random House 's dictionary is a bargain : $25 per copy , as against $47.50 for the nearest competitors ( Funk &; Wagnall 's , Webster 's Third International ) . For another , the need for a new big dictionary definitely existed . Webster 's was last updated five years ago ; other dictionaries go as far back , unrevised though reissued , to 1913 . For a third , Random House has dropped the word count of big dictionaries to 260,000 from an average of 400,000 . Thus it may qualify as the first heavyweight dictionary truly designed for ordinary definition seekers . And beyond that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , board chairman of Random House and senior constellation of the longtime TV show What 's My Line , promoting it all across the country .
