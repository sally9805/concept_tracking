COMMANDER-l by Peter George . 253 pages . Delacorte. $4.95 . <P> <P> After giving Hollywood a whole series of Armageddon operas-On the Beach , Dr. Strangelove , Fail Safe-fiction 's doom boom has worn pretty thin . But not too thin for Welshman Peter George , 41 , who co-authored the Strangelove script and wrote the novel , Red Alert , on which it was based . In Commander-1 , he uses the familiar formula-headline-fresh immediacy wrapped around a minute kernel of plausibility . Red China , newly armed with a few primitive but potent nuclear bombs , decides to eliminate both Russia and the U.S. by convincing each that the other has launched an all-out war . The Chinese smuggle bombs into New York , Moscow and other points , where they are detonated by radio signals from Peking . But when the smoke clears , China is in ruins along with the rest of the world , and only 1,000,000 people survive around the globe , including 100,000 in the U.S. <P> Chief villain is the standard maniac in uniform-in this case a sensible-sounding but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a nuclear submarine that is submerged under 50 ft. of polar ice when the big blowout comes on Christmas , 1965 . When Geraghty finally surfaces , he finds himself on top : every higher-ranking officer is dead . After using machine guns to quell a rebellion by U.S. survivors who get it into their heads to elect a civilian government , he sets himself up as World Leader , or Commander-1 . In his brave new science-fiction world , the males are all drugged into brainless docility , while the sturdiest and , presumably , best-looking women are kept around as Selected Future Leader Breeders . Geraghty 's ultimate goal : to rebuild the U.S. population , then track down and kill all non-Caucasian survivors elsewhere . " We 've had this racial problem once before in the world , " says Geraghty , " but this time we can make sure we do n't have it again . "
