" Aspirin is just plain aspirin and nothing else , " says Wisconsin 's Senator Gaylord Nelson . It is just that , he claims , regardless of how much it costs and whether it carries a famous brand name . Nelson goes further : he believes that prescription drugs for serious illnesses should be dispensed , not under a manufacturer 's trademark name , but under the " generic " ( common chemical ) name , which usually carries a lower price tag . Whether generic and brand-name drugs are really medically equivalent has been debated before Nelson 's Senate Monopoly Subcommittee for almost two months now . So far , no witness or Senator has been able to provide a flat answer-because none is possible . The example of two drugs , one prescription and one nonprescription , makes the point . <P> In the case of over-the-counter aspirin , even so crude a test device as the irritable stomach of a man with a hangover will sometimes show a distinction : two five-grain tablets of one brand , especially from a half-empty bottle that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , will promptly give him heartburn , whereas the same dose of another brand may have no such effect . <P> No Trace of Water . The first aspirin was made by Germany 's Bayer company , and its U.S. descendant ( a division of Sterling Drug Inc. ) today charges six to ten times as much as no-name brands . To justify the difference , Bayer contrasts U.S.P.*minimum standards with its own . Before tableting , says U.S.P. , the basic chemical must be in tabular or needlelike crystals or crystalline powder ; to produce a dependable dissolving rate , Bayer requires a special flake shape and needle shape ( slender , tapered at both ends ) . U.S.P. permits .5% moisture and weight loss on drying ; Bayer will tolerate none . U.S.P. allows up to .1% free salicylic acid ; Bayer holds to one-third of that , and halves three other U.S.P. permissible deviations from absolute purity . In the finished tablets , U.S.P. accepts 5% underweight for the active ingredient ; Bayer none . U.S.P. permits .15% free salicylic acid ; Bayer still holds to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , says U.S.P. , must be complete in five minutes ; Bayer says begin in 2 seconds and be complete within 30 seconds . <P> <P> To turn salicylic acid into acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) , a compound related to acetic acid is used . If the raw aspirin is then cleared of impurities by washing with water , any remaining water will react to create a minute quantity of acetic acid-vinegar . This accounts for the vinegary odor and some of the irritating effect of much fresh aspirin and of most old aspirin . So Bayer uses a more costly , water-free process . <P> 406 Hours of Tests . Penicillin G , one of the most widely used forms of the supreme antibiotic , differs from aspirin in being a prescription item , but resembles it in being free of patent , royalty and basic-research costs . Yet here again there is a huge price spread : E. R. Squibb &; Sons charges the druggist $6.62 for 100 tablets of 200,000 units , while Pennex Products Co. of Verona , Pa. , sells the same number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only U.S.P. standards , but the running check on all antibiotic batches maintained by two different Government agencies .
