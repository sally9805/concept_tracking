U.S. citizens are beginning to attach more and more importance to a 6-in. by 12-in. piece of metal that is each man 's uniquely private property : his auto license plate . And this means that for a growing number of families January is the crudest month . For that is when many new plates are issued , and it is getting so that there are not enough low numbers and letter combinations to go round-no matter what one may be willing to pay . <P> Take Connecticut , where for an extra $10 a driver may request a plate made up of two , three or four letters . The state permits such plates to be handed down as heirlooms in the immediate family , so that it is harder and harder to get your first choice of initials or your favorite four-letter word . Obvious obscenity and scatology is , of course , barred , but one Connecticut car is registered as MERD-it stands for Milk , Eggs , Raymond Dairy . <P> Sometimes painful letter combinations turn up unasked for . The wife of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg relief from the ordeal of driving around town with P-U on her car 's front and rear . A Los Angeles psychiatrist who found himself with a tag bearing the letters N-U-T explained that , while he did not mind it in the least , he was afraid some of his patients might think he was making fun of them . <P> In Washington , D.C. , finagling for a low number has always consumed considerable time and energy . Most coveted are the tags from 1 to 1250 . No. 1 belongs to the president of the board of District of Columbia commissioners ( which issues all D.C. licenses ) . Chief Justice Earl Warren has 10 , Drew Pearson 25 , Roman Catholic Archbishop Patrick A. O'Boyle 37 , Attorney General Robert Kennedy 50 . So intense , in fact , has been the infighting for tags that , starting in 1965 , the commissioners decreed that apart from the 1-1250 series anybody could order any combination of letters and numbers up to five characters merely by paying an extra fee of $25 . Already , customers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse nomenclature as GWHIZ , MINE , YOURS , RELAX , SMILE , TRASH , CRASH . <P> This year thousands of Massachusetts car owners will scrutinize their 1964 plates with a fishy eye ; last year most of the numbers had begun to flake off the 1963 plates by March . Nobody seemed to know exactly why , and there was much suspicion of skulduggery among the inmates of Walpole State Prison , where Massachusetts plates are made . Walpole 's prison publication , The Mentor , recently warned : " Woe be to ye men who made registry plates last year and are desirous of parole this year . " <P> Most states use convict labor to make their license plates , and now and then car owners around the country still unwrap their new tags to find the penciled gag : " Help ! I am being held here against my will ! "
