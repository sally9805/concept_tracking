" In sum : if at first you do n't succeed , look far , travel wide , and find another good college . The U.S. is full of them . <P> In an adjoining box , TIME lists 50 private four-year liberal arts colleges that can give a good education to the high school senior who can not get into Amherst &; Co .

Most were church-founded , and though direct church control is rare nowadays , many still require chapel and religion courses .

Big universities , when raiding small campuses for staff , tend to steal researchers . The schools listed are largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> <P> High Standards . They also attract early bloomers : 63% of current freshmen at St. Paul 's Macalester were in the upper 5% of their high school classes ; 20 are National Merit Scholars . Missouri 's West minster , where Winston Churchill made his " Iron Curtain " speech in 1946 , boasts that not one of its recommended graduates has been turned down at a medical school of his choice for three decades . <P> Last year , Westminster boasted the top Medical School graduate at Harvard , second at Cornell , third and fourth at Penn . <P> Ohio 's College of Wooster has turned out some three dozen college presidents , including the noted scientist brothers Compton-Karl ( M.I.T. ) , Arthur ( Washington University ) and Wilson ( Washington State University ) .
