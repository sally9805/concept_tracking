The small Byzantine church on the site of ancient Vravron , 23 miles east of Athens , was in need of repair , and the task of supervising the job quite naturally fell to Archaeologist John Papadimitriou , director-general of Greece 's Archaeological Services . As the work progressed , Papadimitriou began thinking about all the references to Vravron that he had read in the literature of ancient Greece . When he was finished with the church , he began to explore the grounds around . The result : an archaeological bonanza that since 1948 has brought to light 6,000 objects and statues , to make up what Papadimitriou claims is the most complete and beautiful collection in the world of small works of Greek art dating from the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. <P> Secret Stairs . The classical clues that Papadimitriou had to go on were as intriguing as they were vague . The historian Herodotus mentioned a temple of Artemis that flourished at Vravron . Aristophanes hinted at strange orgies . The rest was a tantalizing mixture of myths and the real civilization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued Iphigenia from being sacrificed by her father Agamemnon , and how later , at the behest of Athena , Iphigenia became Artemis ' priestess at Vravron . She dwelt near some " holy stairs . " and when she died , her grave was adorned " with braided gowns of softest weave " left to the shrine " by women dead with child . " <P> Papadimitriou dug up some marble fragments , and these led him to the site of Iphigenia 's ceremonial tomb . As the years passed , the diggers came upon the temple , a dormitory for young virgins , a Doric-columned stoa even the secret staircase to which Euripides referred , as well as hundreds of mirrors , goblets , rings , vases , and small statues . <P> Though popularly known as the goddess of the hunt , Artemis was worshiped at Vravron as a protector of maternity . From a still legible book of offerings , Papadimitriou and his team confirmed that pregnant women left rings at the temple to secure protection , and that those who died in pregnancy or childbirth bequeathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bears . The statues that the diggers found are mostly of small girls and boys , apparently used to embellish the temple . Who the boys may have been in real life remains a mystery . But about the girls more is known . They bore the title " Little Bears , " for one of their duties was to perform a ritual dance dressed as bears to ward off a plague that according to legend was threatened by Artemis after her holy bear was killed by some Athenian children . <P> " For the first time , " says Papadimitriou , " we can get a complete picture of the private life of ancient Athenians , especially the women . " One relief from the stoa-as fine as anything that adorned the Parthenon-shows Zeus , Hera , Apollo and Artemis , all figures of commanding grace . But the statues of the children are the most endearing of the discoveries . For all the black talk of orgies , the boys and girls are sweetly innocent , fashioned with gentle care by artists of extraordinary talent .
