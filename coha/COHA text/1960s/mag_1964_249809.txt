The acquisitive philosophy of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum of Art is forthright : it will get the best , regardless of the envy of lesser museums , by spending vast effort and $1,000,000 a year to spot and buy good art . To this end it uses a learned and competitive director , plus 100 knowledgeable curators who constantly travel the world . Guiding the effort , by electing the director and curators , and balancing it , by curbing or encouraging them , is the job of the Met 's 38-man board of trustees-and most particularly the president of the board . <P> <P> Last week the Met got a new president who uniquely blends industry and esthetics : Arthur Amory Houghton Jr. , 57 , president of Steuben Glass . <P> Whispers &; Wiretaps . Houghton succeeds Wall Street Lawyer Roland Redmond , 72 , whose 17-year reign has been marked by unprecedented growth . Met attendance nearly quadrupled , to 7,000,000 last year . Half of the museum 's 20 acres of floor space has been renovated , and a glamorous series of openings will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaring stature is also a measure of its cloak-and-dagger , sharp-elbowed driving to get the best . <P> Day-to-day sleuthing is carried out by the energetic director , James J. Rorimer , and his globe-trotting staff , who scrutinize possibilities with " everything from smell to X rays . " Rorimer refuses to tell how his hawkshaws receive their tips . Says he : " Reporters do n't reveal their sources and neither do we . " The director concedes that masterpieces may be heard of through " a letter , a phone call , a whisper , " that U.S. embassies are sometimes sources of information , and that " it is a business fraught with difficulties-wiretapping , fraud , forgeries . " <P> Frantic Frenchmen . The Met 's greatest stroke was its 1961 auction purchase of Rembrandt 's Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer ; armed with backing from Redmond 's board , Rorimer outbid the well-heeled Cleveland Museum with the highest known price ever paid for an art object , $2,300,000 . But that deal involved only money , of which the Met has access to loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches ) ; other triumphs are more intriguing . Four years ago , the Met stirred outrage in the Gaullist Parliament by quietly acquiring , for possibly $750,000 , The Fortune Teller by the belatedly discovered 17th century French master , Georges de La Tour . Redmond himself spotted this buy , but how the export license was arranged has never been revealed . When the Met wants something , it can pounce like a cat . Recently a trusted art dealer discovered a 16th century German chessboard in a country house in England , placed a transatlantic call to Rorimer ; the Met snapped up the object on the basis of a photograph .
