THE man on the cover of this week 's TIME once painted a TIME cover himself . The time was World War II , and the subject was Cartoonist Bill Mauldin 's famed weary dogface , Willie . Now , after a few years of finding himself , Mauldin at 39 is the most promising political cartoonist on the U.S. scene . TIME Cover Artist Henry Koerner journeyed to St. Louis to spend a fortnight getting an artist 's impression of a fellow artist ( see cut . ) <P> For a man who makes his point by inviting a smile , Cover Subject Mauldin has a sober view of his trade . He thinks that " the American public highly overrates its sense of humor . We 're great belly laughers and prat fallers , but we never really did have a real sense of humor . Not satire anyway . We 're a fatheaded , cotton-picking society . When we realize finally that we are n't God 's given children , we 'll understand satire . Humor is really laughing off a hurt , grinning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for the satirist . Right now cartooning is " like going into the garbage-collecting business . There 's no money , but worse than that , there is no prestige . " For other strong opinions , and the career that came of them , see Press Editor John Koffend 's story , Hit It If It 's Big . <P> <P> THE following classified ad appeared last week in the Montreal Star : " Wanted TIME Magazine June 1st <P> 1959 ; will pay $1 each . Call- . " <P> Montreal Bureau Chief Jon Anderson called the number , found it belonged to a mutual-funds salesman who had found TIME 'S cover story that week on the mutual funds ( and Dwight Robinson of the Massachusetts Investors Trust ) the quickest and best explanation of what mutual funds are about . At the Montreal Men 's Press Club , Anderson was told that the going price went as high as $15 for this particular issue . Playing a hunch , Anderson checked the TIME file collected in his own office . Sure enough , June 1 , 1959 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
