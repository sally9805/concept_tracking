There was no denying that over 4,500 Utah sheep had staggered , fallen and died-their feet twitching spasmodically and some frothing at the mouth . There was no denying that their carcasses lay scattered across an area stretching 14 miles downwind from the Dugway Proving Grounds , a restricted U.S. Army chemical , biological and radiological research center in western Utah where nerve gases are tested . But last week there was plenty of denying by the Army that anyone had proved Dugway directly responsible for the sheep deaths . <P> It was true enough , said Army spokesmen , that three operations involving nerve agents were carried out the day before the sheep collapsed . In one , chemical-warfare troops in training watched as three 155-mm. artillery shells containing a short-lived nerve agent were fired off in an area 27 miles inside Dugway 's limits . Later that afternoon , 160 gal . of a more stable nerve agent were destroyed by fire in a disposal training exercise about 19 miles inside the proving grounds . Finally , a nerve liquid was sprayed from a jet aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well within Dugway 's limits , said the Army experimenters . <P> 8-ft . Trenches . Still , there were the sheep . In a preliminary autopsy , a local veterinarian found that their digestive systems were " intact , " but there was evidence of " disturbances in the central nervous system . " In other words , it was n't just something they ate . Then Utah State University veterinarian Delbert A. Osguthorpe reported that more extensive testing had narrowed the cause of death to an organic phosphate compound of a kind found both in insecticides and nerve gas . " Since the Army had admitted conducting the nerve-gas tests the day before the sheep began dying , that would seem to clear the matter up , " said Osguthorpe . <P> But Osguthorpe 's way is not the Army way . While Utah ranchers buried their sheep in 8-ft. trenches and wondered who was going to pay them some $300,000 in damages , Brigadier General William W. Stone of the Army Materiel Command insisted that the heavy , viscous nerve liquid sprayed from the aircraft could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind velocity during the test was between 5 m.p.h. and 20 m.p.h. , with gusts up to 35 m.p.h. blowing in practically a straight line from the proving grounds to Skull Valley , where the sheep died . Facing a delegation of Utah Congressmen in Washington last week , General Stone admitted that " we fully recognize with this occurring right on our doorstep , and probably involving a chemical similar to materials we have been testing , that we are highly suspect . " Investigation of the sheep deaths , he said , would continue .
