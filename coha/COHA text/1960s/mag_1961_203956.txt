With the air of a man who has won a great victory-or would like people to think he has-Fidel Castro turned his guns from the sea and ended the mythical " Yankee invasion " scare . Calling for " a quest of peace " with the new Kennedy Administration , he turned his attention inland last week , and for good reason . There is a very real foe to fight at home . It is the underground rebellion , operating in Cuba 's hills and cities , infiltrating the army and government agencies , doing more damage to the new dictatorship in six months than Castro had managed against the old in a year . <P> Flying southeast down the island to the hills where 400 rebels are holed up , Castro first tried to arrange a parley with one of their leaders , a former captain in his army . When that failed , 10,000 militia attacked and were driven off . In Havana , Castro wasted no time in persuasion ; his revolutionary tribunals held 13 trials in five days , cranked out prison terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " death for nine more . <P> Castro 's Techniques . The killings , bringing Castro 's total executions to 587 , will not stamp out the movement . The top leadership operates in Miami , headquarters of the Frente , which hopes to become a sort of supreme command for the harassment of Castro . The Frente is making impressive preparations : guerrilla training camps in Florida and Guatemala , arms-carrying PT boats that average a trip a week to Cuba , an air group of some 80 flyers who reportedly fly out of the mystery field at Retalhuleu in Guatemala and the inactive U.S. Marine Corps Opa-Locka airbase in Florida . <P> So far , the Frente has done little fighting itself inside Cuba . The actual sabotage is the work of a group of anti-Communist former Castro followers who call themselves the Revolutionary Movement of the People and are organized in every province and major municipality . Using the techniques they learned with Castro , they fight him by breaking political prisoners out of jail , by derailing trains , shooting up militia patrols and triggering bombs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , went on to set off 13 blasts that knocked out main Havana power circuits for 20 hours . <P> Six Months Left ? Yet for all the activity , some of the rebels are growing discouraged . They lack sufficient means , coordination , complain that the U.S. is half asleep and not doing as much as it could . Operations are difficult ; arms-drop plans misfire , and the weapons fall into Castro 's hands . On two occasions M.R.P. efforts to arrange arms drops to disillusioned army officers planning to desert with their commands failed when the arms could not be got . As a result , the process of transforming disaffected Cuban army units into active anti-Castro rebels is almost suspended . <P> The underground Big Two are wide apart on politics and on who gets what funds . The Frente apparently gets virtually all the U.S. financial aid to Cuba 's underground ( estimated to range from $135,000 monthly to as high as $500,000 on occasions ) , and Mr. " B , " the CIA agent in charge , reportedly has suggested the M.R.P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
