txt Ben Hecht , 70 , Dies At His Home Here Ben Hecht , who chronicled high life and low life in Chicago , New York and Hollywood in novels , short stories , plays and a stream of memoirs , died yesterday , apparently of a heart attack . He was 70 years old . Mr. Hecht collapsed while reading in his 14th-floor apartment at 39 West 67th Street . His wife , the former Rose Caylor , tried to revive him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and then summoned a police emergency squad , which administered oxygen . The writer 's physician , Dr Morton S. Bryer , said Mr. Hecht had appeared to be in good condition in a recent check-up . Mr. Hecht 's experiences as a newspaper reporter in Chicago from 1910 until 1924 , when he left for New York , pro // vided a reservoir of experience and anecdote that he drew on throughout his life . The brawling , vital city abounded in pomposities a young iconoclast could expose , abounded also in dramatic criminal activity and in human tribulation that frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He recalled those days in characteristic highly charged style in his autobiography , " A Child of the Century , " published in 1954 . " I haunted streets , studios , whore houses , police stations , courtrooms , theater stages , jails , saloons , slums , madhouses , fires , murders , riots , banquet halls and bookshops , " he wrote . " I ran everywhere in the city like a fly buzzing in the works of a clock , tasted more than any fly belly could hold , learned not to sleep ( an accomplishment that still clings to me ) and buried myself in a tick-tock of whirling hours that still echo in me . " This life had been reflected in his first novel , " Erik Dorn , " whose publication in 1921 made him a national literary figure ; " 1,001 Afternoons in Chicago , " a collection of sketches published in 1923 , and , perhaps most enduringly , in the 1930 play " The Front Page . " Mr , Hecht often was involved in controversy , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , touched off a bitter exchange with Nelson Algren , the novelist . The book had been reprinted by the University of Chicago Press and Mr. Algren had written the introduction , which said that the book started well but turned into a cartoon in the second half . Declining to attend a publication cocktail party for the book , Mr. Hecht said Mr. Algren had never read anything he ( Mr. Hecht ) had written . " In this case he stinks , " he added in reference to the introduction . Mr. Algren countered by accusing Mr. Hecht of refusing " to take the responsibility " for his talent , and said he had written nothing of literary merit after the first publication of " Erik Dorn . " Mr. Hecht was born here on the Lower East Side on Feb. 28. 1894 , the son of immigrants from Russia . He grew up in Racine , Wis. , where he finished high school . Then he briefly joined a small circus , in which an uncle was the strongman . While developing his own shoulders , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper career . He joined the now defunct Chicago Journal as what was called a picture chaser , assigned to acquire , by any means possible , photographs of ax murderers and their victims , sometimes pilfering them from the family piano . Before long , he became a reporter , a job that in an era of journalism untrammeled by notions of responsibility or accuracy , provided plenty of room for creation . Specialized in Crime News Mr. Hecht specialized in crime news , a rich field in Chicago even before the start of Prohibition . He became expert at turning out stories that began like this : " If Fred Ludwig is hanged for the murder of his wife , Irma , it will be because of the little gold band he slipped on her finger on his wedding day , inscribed with the tender words , ' Irma  --  Love Forever ? Fred . ' " In 1914 , Mr. Hecht joined The Chicago Daily News . In 1919 he was sent to Berlin to cover the revolution-torn capital . Describing the Spartacist revolt , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out why a mob of 20,000 workmen and soldiers had for three days hurled themselves with bayonets and machine guns against their countrymen . " During the World War I years , Chicago was also in literary ferment , and Mr. Hecht soon became part of it . He wrote and sold his first short story , " The Unlovely Sin , " when he found he was $3,000 in debt , with a newspaper salary of $40 a week as his only likely source of repayment . The purchaser was H. L. Mencken , then editor of The Smart Set magazine . Like most young writers of the period , Mr. Hecht idolized Mr. Mencken , and a friendship flourished despite the initial check . It was for $45 . Mr. Hecht recalled that he had expected $1,000 . " If these convict labor prices were all that the great Mencken could afford to pay for literature he admired enough to print , my task was clear . I would have to write 25 short stories instead of one before I netted $1,000 . This I did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second novel , " Fantazius Mallare , " Mr. Hecht was haled into court on an obscenity charge . He retained Clarence Darrow , another of his idols , to defend him . Mr. Hecht recalled the lawyer , who secured an acquittal , in this way in his memoir " Gaily , Gaily , " published last year : " The picture of Darrow drawling in front of a jury box is a notable scene of a vanished U. S. A.  --  the great barrister artfully gotten up in baggy pants , frayed linen and string tie and playing dumb for a jury as if he were no lawyer at all but a cracker-barrel philosopher groping for a bit of human truth . " Mr. Hecht also recalled his collaboration with Sherwood Anderson , who was still unpublished , on a play " Benvenuto Cellini . " It remained unfinished because , Mr. Hecht said , Mr. Anderson wished to act out his scenes with a wooden sword instead of writing them . In 1923 , Mr. Hecht 's play " The Egotist " was produced here . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with might , main and epigram . Curious how far an exceedingly clever writer can come from writing a clever play . " Mr. Hecht returned to writing novels and stories for a while , publishing three dimly remembered works , " The Florentine Dagger , " " Humpty Dumpty " and " The Kingdom of Evil , " in two years . In 1926 , his " Count Bruga " appeared . It concerned a scapegrace poet , patterned closely on Mr. Hecht 's longtime friend , Maxwell Bodenheim . The book was hailed in The Times as showing " a mastery of the medium of the novel . " The poet replied with " Duke Herring , " a novel lampooning Hecht . Mr. Hecht 's friendship with Mr. Bodenheim endured through the years . In 1954 , when the poet and his wife were found dead  --  one stabbed , the other shot ? in a furnished room on the Bowery , it was Mr. Hecht who paid for the funeral . Then , four years later , his play " Winkelberg , " also based on Bodenhehn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains my belief , " Mr. Hecht wrote at the time , reflecting as always his romantic view ' of life , " that the ego 's concern ; with itself , however tragic , is al more honorable activity than its ' concern with governments and ! large-scale disasters . " I hope my play makes this ! point , and this point only , and ! that I have written a raucous ; valentine to a poet 's dream and ! agony . " " Winkelberg , " though , was ! not a success . One reviewer wrote , " The play makes it difficult for a playgoer to decide ' whether Bodenheim was a rebel ' of admirable stubbornness and , integrity or a bore who never ; changed or grew up . " In 1930 , Mr. Hecht and an- ! other Chicago newspaperman , ' the late Charles , ; became collaborators . Mr. Hecht 's leap into thei Broadway and Hollywood big ; time came with the Broadway ! production of " The Front Page , " a play he wrote in collaboration ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the overwhelming success of the play and a later screen version ended Mr. Hecht 's chance of becoming a major writer . It was a fast-moving combination of drama and farce , whose main characters were Walter Burns , a flinty city editor patterned after Walter Howey of The Chicago Tribune ! and Herald-Examiner , and dy Johnson , a madcap reporter who was a rough amalgam of ! the two playwrights at their ! wildest . The play was a commercial success , as was their next play , . " 20th Century , " produced in 1932 . It was a comedy about a theatrical producer with Napoleonic delusions . It was also made into a successful motion ? picture . Mr. Hecht and Mr. , who had become friends and neighbors in Nyack , N. Y. , next turned to films , forming their own company here . In. ' , 1934 , they produced " The , Scoundrel , " starring Noel Cow-I ard . In Mr. Hecht wrote or collaborated on about 65 screenplays , including film versions of his own work ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wuther- ; ing Heights , " " Gunge .

" Mr. Hecht found himself inl ' Hollywood during the cinema. , ; capital 's most flourishing finana cial period . He fitted right in . " II work in pictures for deliberate monetary reasons , " he told an ; interviewer during the nineteen ' thirties . " It 's the only institution that has n't treated writers like galley slaves . I tore up a contract with Sam Goldwyn , calling for a guarantee of 50 grand a year for two ideas , only one of which had to be accepted . I tore it up for no reason at all , just because I felt that way . " As a script writer , Mr. Hecht drew a salary m Hollywood of ( more than $300,000 annually during his peak years . Despite the high price he put upon his work , he was nevertheless constantly in demand , and made as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence shortly after ' World War II , Mr. Hecht threw this support behind the terrorist ' organization Irgun Zvei Leumi . ; In a full-page newspaper ad , vertisement that appeared in ' 1947 , he wrote : " Every time you blow up a British arsenal , or wreck a : British jail , or send a British railroad train sky-high , or rob a British bank , or let go with your guns and bombs at the British betrayers and invaders of your homeland , the Jews of America make a little holiday in their hearts . " This and other statements by Mr. Hecht aroused so much anger in Britain that for several months exhibitors refused to show films on which he had worked . In a letter to a London paper , he later offered a partial apology . " The English are , with cavil , " he wrote , " the nicest enemies the Jews have ever had . " Mr. Hecht assailed the Zionist movement as not aggressive enough in the fight for independence , and he said it had betrayed the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge that tie repeated during the remainder of his life , most recently in " Perfidy , " published in 1962 . He said that David Ben-Gurion and other leaders had consented to the destruction of Hungary 's Jews because they feared the effect of the arrival of so many persons at one time in Palestine . Mr. Hecht , a stocky muscular man who favored bow ties and what Damon Runyon once referred to as an inoffensive mustache , was described by friends as a compulsive writer who seldom let a day pass without working ferociously with pad and pencil . Among his works were " A Jew in Love , " published in 1930 ; a collection of . short stories , " The Champion From Far Away , " 1937 ; " Actor 's Blood , " 1937 ; " A Book of Miracles , " 1939 ; " 1,001 Afternoons in New York , " a collection of sketches written for the newspaper PM in 1939-40 ; " Charlie , " a biography of Mr. , 1957 , and " The Sensualists , " 1959 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson , H.

Manners Not Always Nice Of " A Child of the Century , " Saul Bellow , the novelist , wrote in The Times : " His manners are not always nice , but then nice manners do not always make interesting autobiographies , and this autobiography has the merit of being intensely interesting . If he is occasionally slick , he is also independent , forthright and original . Among the pussycats who write of social issues today , he roars like an old-fashioned lion . " Mr. Hecht also remained active as a screenwriter until his death , and he appeared frequently on television , most recently last Sunday on a program recalling the era of Mayor James J. Walker . Besides his widow , herself an author , Mr. Hecht is survived by a daughter , Jenny , an actress . A previous marriage , to the former Marie Armstrong , ended in divorce in 1925 . They had a daughter , Edwina . A funeral service will be held at 1 P.M. Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
