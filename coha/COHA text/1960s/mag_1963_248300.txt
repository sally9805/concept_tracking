Lobbing a working communications satellite out to the fringes of space was a signal achievement . The task of repairing it in orbit seemed wildly improbable . But when Bell Telephone Laboratories ' Telstar sullenly ignored a command after four months of faithful performance , Bell 's electronic doctors wasted no time . While unresponsive Telstar circled the earth in silence , they spent six frantic weeks in their labs concocting a cure for its ailment . <P> <P> Practical experience with Relay , the communications satellite built by RCA , was no help . Relay , which went into orbit on Dec. 13 , refused to work properly right from the start ; a defective part let most of the power leak out of its storage battery . But Relay still obeyed commands . It was told to throw switches to isolate the faulty transponder ( transmitter-receiver ) . Solar cells were able to recharge the satellite 's battery . Last week Relay was in operation , using its spare transponder . <P> Diagnosis . Telstar , which had no spare transponder , was in much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its radio beacon was transmitting normally ; so were the host of instruments that report by telemetry on its internal condition . They showed that Telstar 's solar cells were generating plenty of electricity . Its temperature was normal , and no intruder , such as a meteorite , had damaged its delicate nervous system . Apparently the only trouble was in the command decoders . Telstar was ablebodied , but without working decoders it could not hear and obey commands . <P> One clue to Telstar 's trouble was the curious manner in which the satellite had quit . Several times before total failure it had reluctantly obeyed a command only after it had been repeated for many minutes . This suggested that the passage of a signal through one of the ailing decoders tended to cure it in much the same way that exercise helps some human ills . <P> <P> But what disease of space is cured by electrical exercise ? The Bell men were aware that transistors behave strangely after they are bathed in powerful radiation . Ions ( electrically charged particles ) released by the radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There they form a surface layer that prevents the transistors from working properly . Something of this sort may have happened to Telstar . It was built to resist an expected level of radiation in space , but just before it was launched , the U.S. exploded a powerful nuclear test bomb above the atmosphere near Johnston Island ( TIME , July 20 ) . Eminent scientists had dismissed the suggestion that the test would create much high-level radiation , but their forecast was wildly wrong . Telstar 's instruments reported long-lasting radiation 100 times as strong as had been expected . <P> <P> Zero Gate . To find out whether space radiation was the guilty party , Bell engineers hooked up a command decoder just like Telstar 's and exposed it to gamma rays in a shielded chamber . It went out of action quickly , and the engineers traced the trouble to a single transistor called the " zero gate " designed to react to short pulses-coded zeros-in command signals . With the zero-counting transistor blocked by ions , the decoder could receive no zeros , and a binary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is meaningless if deprived of half its vocabulary .
