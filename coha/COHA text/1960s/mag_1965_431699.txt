 | 007 The Spy With the Golden TouchJames Bond , that intrepid secret agent , has survived every fiendish pitfall to become a phenomenal supersalesman ON MARCH 4 , 1963 , a brawny young Scot with a set of monumental eyebrows and a perpetual five-o'clock shadow flashed on a New York movie screen , playing the role of imperturbable , irresistible , impeccable James Bond , British Secret Agent 007 . Thus was set off an explosion whose reverberations are still being felt around the world . The male cosmic bomb was Sean ( pronounced Shawn ) Connery , and the film was Dr. No . Together they sent forth shock waves which along the way have founded fortunes , given a new look to ladies ' underwear , unleashed 150 million dollars ' worth of 007-tagged merchandise , produced a crop of literary and psychoanalytic analyses of the phenomenon and , as a final hallmark of success , started a gold rush of imitators . However unpremeditated this mushrooming success may seem , the creation of James Bond 114s been about as casual an operation as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion of the talents , skills and imagination of a remarkable group of people , plus a set of circumstances as unusual as that found in any Bond novel . Dr. No was based on a novel by the late Ian Fleming , a journalist who had been in British naval intelligence during World War II . It was a well-staged film fantasy , complete with a mad scientist , a mysterious island , quantities of ex-  | traordinary gadgets and a good-guy hero who , despite every fiendish pitfall , never lost his self-assurance , his girl or the crease in his well-pressed pants . Bond , who had been created by Fleming as a dehumanized instrument of government policy , emerged on the screen as another character altogether . Through a magic process engineered by the producers , Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman , directed by Terence Young and played by Connery , Bond burst forth as a suave Superman with a tiger in his gold-plated Aston-Martin tank . In the film 's 82 minutes of action , Bond was threatened by king-size tarantulas , almost toasted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of villainy by members of 5MERsH , the code name of Bond 's implacable enemies . From all this he not only emerged triumphant but managed in the process to kiss five girls , ogle three others and save democracy . The whole thing was carried off with a spoofing good humor , and the result was instant success for the film . Today , after two more Bond films , From Russia With Love and Goldfinger , the tally on the economic scoreboard is enough to boggle the mind . Thirty million people have seen the first three installments of the James Bond saga , and there are still eight more to come . The films have earned more than 70 million dollars . One of them , Gold finger , brought in 45 million dollars in one year , eclipsing the mark of 41 million dollars that Gone With 7%e Wind took 26 years of hard running to set . In New York , when Dr. No and From Russia With Love went on as a re-issue double bill , crowds waited in line for an hour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zil to Pakistan . Many reasons have been suggested for the success of the films . One that seems to make as much sense as any is given by Bond press agent Torn Carlile . " Bond films , " he says , " are modern fairy tales spun out of today 's headlines , and they are the greatest escape from reality since Mack Sennett . " Buying Stampede . But the succes of the films is scarcely the entir story . Dapper James Bond , it ha been discovered , has so much se and sales appeal that the mere in elusion of his name or his number 007 , in connection with shirts , mal deodorants , hats , neckties , men ' suits , vodka , girls ' gold underwear and an assortment of other items starts a buying stampede . In Holland , for example , a stor put 4000 James Bond 007 shirts o sale on a Saturday . By nightfall the were sold out . In London , the Hil ton Hotel had a nightclub that was operating in almost total solitude ? until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it 's so noisy , crowded and prosperous that every night seems like New Year 's , Eve . - In France , where 007 is known as zero-zero-sept , the impact has J  | scarcely been less . When the golden underwear inspired by the film Goldfinger was put on sale with some trepidation by department stores , they discovered , to their amazement , that women fought to he first in line . A French public-relations consultant firm named Services et Methodes made a survey that showed that men most affected by Bond were dissatisfied with their own image of virility , felt that they were leading sedentary lives and were dominated by their wives . They also felt that dressing like James Bond creates the aura of virility . Last February , when Goldfinger first appeared on French movie screens , French designers and tailors were ready . Although white dinner jackets were virtually unknown in France , 200 of them were sold in one store alone the first week they went on sale . A jewelry manufacturer sold 3000 pairs of 007 cuff links in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch up on his back orders . " It was , " said a director of Services et Methodes , which masterminded the operation , " the greatest thing to hit France since Davy Crockett and Mickey Mouse , but this time it hit the adults . " Amalgamated Hero . To date , over 30 million copies of the 13 James Bond novels have been sold around the world . They have been translated into 18 languages . Their fans have ranged widely enough to include the late President John F. Kennedy ? who , when asked at a press conference why the lights in his White House bedroom were burning so late , replied , " I 'm sitting up reading James Bond " ? and a nine-year-old girl in Illinois who wrote a composition nominating James Bond for the title of " Greatest Living American . " Told that 007 was not an American , she replied , " Ca n't we make him an honorary one ? " The idea of creating a character named James Bond occurred to Ian Fleming in 1952 . Educated at Eton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munich , Fleming had had a colorful , if not financially successful , life . After resigning his commission in the Black Watch regiment , to which he had been posted on his graduation from Sandhurst , he turned first to journalism , then to banking . At the outbreak of World War II , when naval intelligence asked the Bank of England to recommend a man who " was good at languages and knew the international scene , " they suggested Fleming . Appointed personal assistant to the director of British naval intelligence , by the war 's end Fleming was a commander , the rank he later assigned to his hero Bond . After the . war he returned to journalism as chief of the foreign news service for the London Sunday Times . On vacation in Jamaica , with time on his hands , Fleming began to write a book . It was called Casino Royale and was a combination of his own ex- periences and the things that had fascinated him throughout his life : the odds in gambling ( Fleming was a tournament-caliber bridge player ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful women . The character , James Bond , was an amalgam of the tough commando and secret-agent types he had known during the war . His name Fleming , a bird watcher , took from the American ornithologist , James Bond . The numbers double-o-seven were the last three digits in his literary agent 's telephone number . Casino Royale had only a modest success , but it caught the eye of Gregory Ratoff , a Hollywood film producer , who paid the author $6000 for the film rights . Ratoff died before he could make use of the rights , and in time they were sold to another producer who controls them today . ( Such is the power of the double-o-seven magic that the present owner recently rejected an offer of half a million dollars and a 25-percent cut of the profits for the film rights to Casino Royale . ) Tremendous Lark ! Following his first book , Fleming inaugurated a writing schedule that he held to until his death on August 12 , 1964 . Ten months of the year he did his research . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he water-skied , skin-dived , birdwatched , wrote and corrected proof . In 1961 screen writer Wolf Mankowitz met a producer named Cubby Broccoli in London and suggested that the James Bond books would make good movies . Mankowitz also mentioned that a man named Harry Saltzman had the options on all the stories save two ? Casino Royale and Thunderball ? and needed only money , a distribution system , a cast , a director and a place to shoot them . Broccoli , who is said to be the great-nephew of the man who invented the vegetable of the same name , was clearly no man to be daunted by odds like these . He met Saltzman , a booking agent who had once been a mule buyer for the French army , and , after a short stretch of maneuvering for position , they clasped hands and vowed to remain inseparable until they had produced an epic . The assembling of the Dramatis Personae began . Saltzman and Broccoli had to have a James Bond , and no well-known actor wanted to fill the bill . Finally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ran a contest to let its readers select a Bond . Their selection was not a professional actor , so the producers eventually picked Sean Cannery , who had been playing bit parts in British films but had made a recent hit on a TV show . Connery was not a very promising candidate . Formerly a printer 's apprentice ( after leaving school at 14 in his native Edinburgh ) , a milkman , a long-distance truck driver , a coffin polisher and a seaman , he began his theatrical career as a chorus boy in the London production of South Pacific . I  | When Fleming met Connery , he was shocked . In place of his polished hero , he saw an untidy Scots lad with a marked Edinburgh burr and " Scotland Forever " tattooed on his forearm . His first reaction was , " Oh no , not him . " But Fleming gave in at the insistence of Director Terence Young , who had the job of bringing 007 to life . Connery got the part at a salary of $1000 a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The first film , Dr. No , earned six million dollars , and work began on From Russia With Love , which really broke the gates . Following the worldwide triumph of his brainchild , Fleming was asked by one of his newspaper friends how it felt to become both a world figure and a millionaire in ( Our years . " They tell me that my exports are the equivalent to the sterling value of a reasonable-size shoe factory , " Fleming replied . In 1961 Fleming , who had had two earlier heart attacks , was told by his doctor to cut down on his smoking , brandy drinking and golf . For a time he did , but it was only temporary . Over lunch he told a friend , " During the war , I asked one of our best and most daring agents how he could keep going back into enemy territory without ever losing his nerve . He told me , It is n't how long you live that makes a life , old boy . It 's what you pack into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree with him . " Three years later , after a round of golf , Fleming had a heart seizure . Almost his last words were , " It 's all been a tremendous lark . "
