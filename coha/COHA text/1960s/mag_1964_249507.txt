" Horses for courses , " the old saying goes . It was never truer than last week , when a big bay who fancies Aqueduct Race Track the way most horses fancy sugar cubes , won the Belmont Stakes-thus dashing Northern Dancer 's hopes of becoming the first Triple Crown winner since Citation in 1948 . <P> <P> Trainer Elliott Burch worried for a week before he decided to enter Quadrangle in the race . Paul Mellon 's handsome colt has the look of a classic horse : at 16.1 hands and 1,100 lbs. , he is one of the biggest three-year-olds in the U.S. And he has breeding to match : his sire , Cohoes , won stakes at two , three and four , and his dam , Tap Day , was a daughter of Calumet Farm 's great Bull Lea . But in the Kentucky Derby , Quadrangle finished fifth behind Northern Dancer ; in the Preakness , the best he could do was fourth . Still , Burch decided to gamble , and the deciding factor might well have been Quadrangle 's record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five starts . <P> Worst of the Three . But try and tell that to the fans . On race day , 61,215 of them-biggest crowd in the Belmont 's 96 years-were in the stands , and Northern Dancer , at 4 to 5 , was clearly the people 's choice . Why not ? The Canadian-bred colt had won the Derby and Preakness with ease . The only thing against him was history . At H mi. , the Belmont is the longest of the Triple Crown races , and in the 15 years since Citation , odds-on favorites have lost seven times . Two , like the Dancer , were trying for a triple : Tim Tarn in 1958 ( a broken-legged second ) , and Carry Back in 1961 ( a dismal seventh ) . <P> At post time , the odds against Quadrangle were 13 to 2 . Jockey Manuel Ycaza thought that was pretty funny . " This is a free-running colt , " he said . " He can beat any horse in the country . " As if to prove it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased up . Other horses pounded past : California 's Hill Rise ( 2 to 1 ) and long-shot Orientalist ( 42 to 1 ) dueled for the lead ; Quadrangle slipped back to fourth , and Northern Dancer was running fifth . Suddenly , Orientalist began to bear out from the rail . " I saw that big hole , " said Ycaza , " and I said to myself , ' You can steal this race . ' " In a wink , Quadrangle zipped past the leaders and opened up a one-length lead . <P> Carnations for Two . On the outside , aboard Northern Dancer , Jockey Bill Hartack made his move , closed to within a neck . " I leaned over and talked in the horse 's ear , " said Ycaza . " I kept saying , ' Let 's get the Belmont . Let 's get the Belmont . ' Then I hit him twice . " Quadrangle pulled away like an Atlas leaving the pad . At the wire , he was two lengths ahead of Roman Brother , six ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreath around Quadrangle 's neck . " One for my wife , " he explained , " and one for little Manuelito . " For himself , Ycaza plucked something even sweeter : a 10% slice of the $110,850 winner 's purse .
