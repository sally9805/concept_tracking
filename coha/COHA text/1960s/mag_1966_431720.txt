 | If you want the world to take stock in you Do n't Sell Yourself Short c . Ar A PARTY I was much attracted to a pretty girl with a charming personality . A fellow I know , doing publicity for a big diamond firm , sauntered up to her , spoke of her graceful posture and told her she was pretty . After a while he said he 'd like to use her as a model for photographs to advertise some jewels . She could pose with a halfmillion dollars ' worth of necklaces and bracelets , he said . She laughed and said she 'd love to . " But my hands are awful , " she added , and sprawled them out to him , with her fingers wide apart . Up to that moment I had n't noticed her hands -- which were a bit red and rather large . But after that uncalled-for remark I almost forget her hair , which I had thought so fetching , and her lovely violet eyes  | and engaging smile . And as we vent on talking I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hands .... I do n't say that you ought to wave flags and ring bells in an attempt to Advertise your own excellence and importance . There are enough boasters , heaven knows . But if you 're too modest to throw bouquets at yourself , must you throw brickbats ? Let me tell you of a wise and a foolish virgin I met at that same party . One of them , Alice , pulled off one of her earrings and showed it to her friend . " Pretty , is n't it ? " she asked . " And just think , Eloise , I got these earrings at a ten-cent store . Oh , they 're not as nice as yours , I know . But then , yours are expensive . " Eloise , the wise virgin , smiled and said nothing . But she also , I happened to know , was wearing inexpensive earrings . You think she should have told her riend ? Why ? It was nobody 's affair ut her own where she got her hings . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , but she was n't asked . She id n't have much money , but she did ave excellent taste . Why should n't e benefit by her superior judgment nd allow people to think what they leased ? What was the result of Alice 's inscretion ? Well , as I was leaving the rty I heard one lady say to another , o , not the dark girl with Harry ? e one with the ten-cent earrings . " This incident illustrates the almost inevitable effect on hearers of any self-dispraise . When you open that personal door of familiarity , those who rush in can often be very disagreeable . To illustrate how ill-advised most self-disparagement is , just imagine that those slurring remarks are made by someone else . You say , perhaps , " Oh , I do n't care how I put on my hat . I 'm too old now . Nobody notices me any more . " But suppose some personal demon followed you about saying , " Oh , shove it on any which way , old gal . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would you like it ? Is n't it just as bad when you say it yourself ? Many people make themselves unmagnetic ? if not actively disliked ? by always making a play for sympathy . Your mother or your sweetheart may care , but to everyone else the recital of your troubles and illnesses is usually a bore . If , when you try to account for not looking well , you say , " I did n't shut my eyes all night ? I must look awful , " you 've just injured yourself uselessly . Nobody is interested in the reason you 're seedy , and nobody believes you anyway . If you exerted yourself to be animated and charming , if you complimented others and thought of something kind to do or interesting to say , perhaps they would n't notice your haggard face . Why do so many people voluntarily disparage themselves , and reveal failings and deficiencies better left  | untold ? For several reasons , perhaps ? all mistaken . Some say , " I 'm afraid this dress is awful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why no , Ida , I think it 's very pretty , and most becoming . " They are merely fishing for compliments . With some it 's a sort of chronic self-pity . Saying things like " I 'm broke ? I do n't see how I 'll make out till payday , " or " My husband made a terrible fuss about the household bills today , " reveals a definite inferiority complex . But most of these confessions are due to simple thoughtlessness , or to an inordinate tendency to talk . For when one talks too much , one is apt to talk of oneself . Some people indulge an irresistible urge , upon meeting a friend ? or even a stranger ? to pour out a sort of oral diary , telling everything that has happened to them and everything that is in their minds . And it is in the midst of such uncontrolled chatter that these little derogatory confessions slip out . Quite apart from the practical benefits in guarding against selfdepreciation , a discreet repression improves your morale . Just as a boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more powerful , so a certain amount of reticence gives you more power . It lifts you to a higher plane of self-respect . The boy who is deformed and does n't cornplain or mention it ; the girl who is handicapped in beauty and is silent about it , and seeks to excel in other lines ; the woman who suffers pain and never betrays it ; the man who is disappointed and carries on with smile ? all are acting with a more effective mental and moral force than the one who lets his tongue wag over his troubles . They are building character ; they are making themselves more valuable ; they are growing in power , in wisdom and in influence .. Stories of the fortitude of actors under suffering and misfortune are classic ? and mostly true . When the curtain is up , private trials must be forgotten . I once called on a well-known star who was suffering from such an excruciating attack of arthritis that he had to remain in his dressing room at the theater night and day for almost a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance and act his part so well that no one in the audience suspected his agony that was nerve ? but he positively forbade every member of his company to speak about his condition ? that was intelligence . " The show must go on ! " That 's the rule of the theater . It should be the rule in life as well . We , too , owe it to our friends to play our parts without apologies .
