Anyone invoking the Bible these days is always well advised to double-check his quotation ; in the current flurry of Biblical revision and retranslation , it might have suddenly become archaic or incorrect . Last week two more additions to the changing Bible were announced . <P> New Torah . In Philadelphia , the Jewish Publication Society of America announced a milestone in its gigantic Biblical scholarship project . After eight years , Jewish scholars led by Hebrew Union College 's Harry Orlinsky ( who was the only non-Christian on the committee that produced the Revised Standard Version ) have completed a new translation of the Torah , the five books of Moses , which will be published in January . They hope eventually to finish the entire Old Testament in a 20-year project that has the backing of all branches of American Judaism-and the best scholars from each . <P> <P> Traditionalists who read new Bibles mainly to be outraged can make short work of the new Torah . Its first words are not " In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God began to create the heaven and the earth ... " <P> An uncompromising work of scholarship , the new Torah has something to antagonize everybody . Singers of spirituals will note with dismay that the Israelites crossed the Sea of Reeds rather than the Red Sea . Moralists may be chagrined at the retranslation of the Third Commandment , which now reads , ' ' You shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord your God ; for the Lord will not clear one who swears falsely by His name " -a dictum against perjury but not profanity . From increased knowledge of ancient Hebrew , the scholars translated the Hebrew nefesh to mean " the man himself " rather than his soul-since the Biblical Hebrews had no concept of soul . They also decided that the first paragraph of Genesis describes primeval wind , rather than the spirit of God , sweeping over the water . <P> Translated directly from the Hebrew Masoretic text , the new Torah leaves out Elizabethan thees and thous , shuns traditional Biblical prose . Says Translator Orlinsky : " Our constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as contemporary understanding will permit into modern , readable English , discarding the errors and the obstacles which , through misunderstanding or a misplaced traditionalism , have stood between modern man and a clear knowledge of God 's Word . " <P> Argument Settler . In another momentous attempt to clear up misunderstandings , Nashville 's Abingdon Press has published what may be the greatest argument settler since the Guinness Book of World Records - a four-volume , 4,000-page Interpreter 's Dictionary of the Bible . <P> The dictionary , billed as " by far the most comprehensive Bible Dictionary ever published , " is the first major definer of Bible terms to be published in 50 years . Its 8,000 entries include " every person named in the Bible or Apocrypha ; every town and region , hill and stream ; every plant , animal and mineral ; every object used in daily life ; every Biblical doctrine and theological concept .
