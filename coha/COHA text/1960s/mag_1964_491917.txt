Almost all the automobile accidents that kill or injure more than a million Americans every year are soon forgotten . Last May 19 , however , there was a smashup in New York City that was different . Its echoes are still ringing , and may be ringing for months to come . It was a three-car crash which took the lives of all five people in one car and badly injured the driver of another . The driver of the third car , a 23-year-old man named Gareth Martinis , escaped injury  --  and the evidence strongly suggested that it was his reckless driving whichcaused the accident . This in itself would have been a one-day newspaper story . What made it more is the fact that Martinis is a judge 's son and that three of his father 's colleagues acquitted him of a charge of drunken and reckless driving after only five minutes ' deliberation . The ensuing uproar in the press has stirred ugly talk of favoritism , put a whole political system under fire and spurred the authorities into charging Martinis again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homicide . At times it has seemed that Martinis was being tried in the newpapers . As for the pending courtroom trial , Martinis 's attorney is moving to have the case dismissed on the ground that a man can not be tried twice for the same offense . There is an excellent chance that Martinis may come out of the affair with no penalty more serious than the temporary loss of his driver 's license . In short , whether Martinis is guilty or not . something apparently went terribly wrong with the whole process of law and justice . The case of Gareth Martinis began at 7:30 on the warm evening of May 19 . He was alone in his gray 1956 DeSoto sedan , driving north on the Henry Hudson Parkway in the Bronx . A low , grassy island , six feet wide , separates the three northbound lanes from the three going south . It was still full daylight . Traffic was moderate , the speed limit was 45 mph . Ahead of him on the parkway was a 1960 Plymouth driven by Herman Brunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johannah , 75 , her twin sister Mrs. Catherine Jacobs , their longtime friend Mrs. Eleanor Bracken , 76 , and Raymond Radigan , the Brunk couple 's sevenyear-old great-grandson . The boy was probably asleep in the back seat as his elders enjoyed their Sunday drive . Suddenly the Brunk car was rammed in the right rear . The impact catapulted the Plymouth across the low island , into the path of southbound traffic . A tremendous crash and a screech of metal shattered the evening . The car had collided head-on with a 1963 Pontiac . There were no groans from the Brunk car after the crash . Axes and crowbars had to be used to extricate the five bodies . In the Pontiac , Eugene Kramon , a 48-year-old slacks manufacturer , was still conscious : he remembers someone shouting , " Hey , Mac , I think this one 's alive . " Then he sank into oblivion . Kramon 's life had been saved by his seat belt , which absorbed much of the impact before it snapped . He suffered two broken legs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had observed the horrifying crash . Roger Lee , a 16-year-old schoolboy who was playing ball next to the parkway , saw the Martinis car approach the Brunks from behind . " The car swerved , " he testified later . " It kept going back and forth , from one lane to another . " He was properly cautious about his testimony and would say only that the car was going at " a good speed ... over the forty-five-mile limit . " Mrs. Celia Silverman. another bystander , estimated the car was going about 90 miles an hour . Whatever the case , physical evidence left no doubt that Martinis 's car had bumped the rear of the Plymouth . Martinis pulled up on a service road off the parkway and walked back to the scene of the wreck . A woman heard him say , to nobody in particular , " Do n't touch anybody . " Then he walked off . It is seven blocks from the scene to the apartment house of Criminal Court Judge and Mrs. Joseph A. Martinis , Gareth Martinis 's parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with his parents . According to witnesses , he first went to a bar and met Mrs. Delores Smith , a petite , attractive brunette of 37 who lives on the ground floor of the apartment building . Mrs. Smith followed him out and they went to her apartment . On the way , Martinis saw a friend and asked him to call the police . Three quarters of an hour after the accident Sgt. Morris Reiter knocked on " Dee " Smith 's door and asked to see Martinis . And here the crucial facts begin to get muddled . Several of the cops who came in contact with Martinis that night were called as witnesses . Their descriptions of his behavior conflicted startlingly . Sergeant Reiter testified that Martinis was sober . " 1 did n't smell any alcohol , " he said . " There was nothing about him that would indicate to me that he was under the influence of alcohol . . He was stuttering . . . at ( one ) point he was incoherent .. . . I would say he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie him down and cover him up . " Shortly thereafter , Patrolman John R. Kevern appeared at the apartment and escorted the judge 's son to the station house . There he was questioned by both Kevern and Patrolman John F. Johnston of the Accident Investigation Squad . Patrolman Kevern testified that Martinis was drunk . " I detected the odor of alcohol .... His eyes were partially bloodshot and he swayed from side to side , " he said . Notes in Kevern 's official sobriety report included such unequivocating phrases as " antagonistic . . profanity and fighting ... breath strong ... balance swaying .. . finger-to-nose , right ( and left ) arm , uncertain . . . speech is slurred . " His report concluded that Martinis was intoxicated and unable to drive safely . Patrolman Johnston disagreed . " He was cooperating .. . . I detected no odor of alcohol from his breath . . . . His eyes were red from rubbing , I thought . . . . He slurred a few words ( because ) he was in a hurry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to take a drunkometer test , which would have shown how much alcohol he had in his system . He refused . Thereupon the officer who entered the booking , Lt. Brendan J. O'Sullivan , gave him the " straight-line " test . " His breath was ... alcoholic , " he testified later . " He was in a highly excited state ... I asked him to approach me , walking a line . . . he took . . . two steps . . . ( and moved off ) about sixinches. . . . 1 asked him to return to the line . .. . He said , ' What line ? ' " Detective Thomas Rocks questioned Martinis , and he testified , " At the time I talked to him , no , I could n't say he acted intoxicated . " Rocks , however , admitted that this was sometime after 10 P.M. , or several hours after the crash . While Martinis was being questioned , news of the arrest spread , and a covey of newspapermen was waiting for Martinis to emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Post photographer who had his camera ready . " He bit a cop 's finger " Seymour Zee , a New York Journal-American photographer , describes what happened when Martinis came out . " He ran out of the back room at us . As he passed the door , he raised both hands and sent Artie 's camera crashing to the floor . He started to choke Artie , digging his fingernails into Artie 's neck . A lieutenant , a sergeant and a captain climbed over me to break it up .... This Martinis was like a mad dog . He bit the finger of a cop . The cop was shouting ' ouch ! ' and let one go at Martinis . That 's how his nose began to bleed . Then he ( Martinis ) went for me . The cops put cuffs on him . And even while he was on the floor , he tried to kick the cops in the groin ! " The cop whose finger was bitten was Patrolman Robert Sullivan , six-feet-two and 230 pounds of muscle . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter later . " Next thing I knew , ( Martinis ) had two fingers of my left hand in his mouth . He was biting and kicking . Under police regulations I had to defend myself . He was definitely drunk , in my opinion . If other policemen made any other determination , they were wrong . " Pomerantz , five-feet-nine and slightly built , was distraught for hours after the happening . " He was a wild man  --  a wild man ! He came at me like a ton of bricks , and he stunk of liquor ! " Shortly after this melee the judge 's son was arraigned before Judge Samuel J. Ohringer on misdemeanor charges of drunk and reckless driving and leaving the scene of the crash . He posted $500 bail , plus another $500 for a simple assault charge brought by Pomerantz , and went home . The man responsible for bringing the charges and prosecuting the case was Bronx County District Attorney Isidore Dollinger . After four years as D.A. , the 60-year-old Dollinger was still little known outside his bailiwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a closely knit political machine . The biggest moment of his career had come only 10 days before the accident , when 1,400 fellow Democrats threw a $100-a-plate political fund-raising dinner in his honor at the Waldorf-Astoria . Up on the hotel dais that night with the proud D.A . was the Honorable Charles A. Buckley , longtime member of the U.S. House of Representatives and powerful Democratic leader of the Bronx , whose approval is needed by any Democrat hoping to get nominated for any office in that borough . Good Buckley Democrats filled the sea of tables below , and for all the size of the crowd , few there were strangers to each other . According to the program , Judge Martinis ( who had served with D.A . Dollinger in the New York state legislature in 1948 ) was seated at table 75 . Judge ? bringer , who would arraign young Martinis , was within chatting distance , at table 73 . The young assistant D.A . who would prosecute the case , Morris Weintraub , was at table 205 . And two judges who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Judge Ambrose J. Haddock at table 215 , and Judge Francis X. O'Brien at table 65 . Of the three judges in the case to come , the only absentee was Morris Weinfeld , who comes from Manhattan . In the course of the dinner Charley Buckley proudly announced to the assemblage that every one of Dollinger 's 50 assistant prosecutors was a Democrat . A cheer went up even though this was news to nobody . Qualifications for a job in the Bronx D.A . ' s office include the ability to ring doorbells , get out the vote and attend all fund-raising affairs . When the morning papers of May 20 reported the crash , the phones at Dollinger 's office started buzzing . One reporter mentioned to the D.A . that the public seemed concerned that Martinis might be treated lightly because of his father . " It does n't matter if he is the son of a judge , a governor or a President , " said Dollinger . " We treat them all alike . " Then why was n't young Martinis being charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years in jail instead of a misdemeanor with a maximum jail sentence of one year ? The charge could still be changed , " if the facts warrant , " answered Dollinger ; it would depend on whether the investigalion showed " criminal negligence " as opposed to " ordinary negligence . " As letters poured in demanding no quarter for the judge 's son , Doflinger announced on May 31 that he would " definitely " go to the grand jury to get a felony indictment . But first , he said , he needed the autopsy report on Herman Brunk , to determine whether the 75-yearold victim was intoxicated or had suffered a heart attack just before the crash , And he would have to interview Eugene Kramon , whose testimony was " vital . " Since Kramon was in traction and his smashed jaw was wired , making speech impossible , it would naturally be some time before he P could be questioned . The autopsy report arrived , showing that Brunk had died of multiple fractures and that there was no liquor in his system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand jury on June 18 . But when that date came , Dollinger announced that since his " vital " witness , Kramon , was still unable to talk , the presentation to the grand jury would be delayed indefinitely . On June 27 Gareth Martinis was tried on the original misdemeanor charges by Judges Haddock , O'Brien and Weinfeld . Martinis 's attorney elicited somewhat conflicting testimony on the speed of the Martinis car . Two witnesses  --  a bartender and a truckdriver  --  testified that Martinis arrived at the bar of a West Side hotel about four P.M. on the day of the crash and left about seven P.M. He consumed three or four bottles of beer , they said . No witnesses were produced to indicate what he had been doing before four P.M , The police who testified gave conflicting accounts of Martinis 's sobriety . But the D.A . did not call Patrolman Sullivan , who said he had had his fingers bitten and had to knock Martinis down and bloody his nose to subdue him . Sullivan , explained the D.A . ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photographer Pomerantz was not called , nor were any of the newspapermen who witnessed the wild scene in the station house . The trial lasted through Thursday , Friday and part of Monday . On Monday afternoon the judges retired to their chambers . Five minutes later they came back with a unanimous verdict of acquittal . The verdict provoked a storm of protest . Incensed citizens from all over the country jammed the mails with letters addressed not only to the principals in the trial but to newspapers , civic orgaeons tenons . He got a new one shortly thereafter by falsifying his application , lost it when the Motor Vehicles department found him out , applied for a new license after a year  --  and got it . There were 10 unanswered traffic tickets in the glove compartment of Martinis 's car after the crash . But his driving record is only one of many clues to the strange nature of Gareth Martinis which remained undisclosed during his trial . Thy only son of Judge Martinis  --  a eleran jurist known for being tough on train : otTendcrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding and fits of temper He was somewhat pampered as a child , particularly by his mother . In September . 1957 , at 17 , he was admitted to the Fork Union ! Va . ) Military Academy as an I th-grader , but withdrew in February , 1958 , after going AWOL rather than be disciplined . He reenrolled in September , 1958 , went AWOL again , and left for good within two weeks after admission . in September , 1959 , Martinis enlisted in the Army for a three-year hitch  --  hut receised a general discharge 10 months later . He was released under section SPN 264 of Army Regulation 635-209 titled " Character and Behavior Disorders . " The Army will give no specifies . After his discharge , he found occasional work as a laborer on construction jobs . Flc seemed to have no particular ambitions . In 1961 he met pretty , auburn-haired Kathy Dolan at a dance ; the couple married a few weeks later and set up housekeeping in their own apartment in the Bronx . Kathy thought Martinis 's mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son had married beneath himself . The marriage was stormy , and when Kathy became pregnant in 1962 , Martinis began drinking heavily and running with a wild crowd . He would bring his friends home , and seemed amused at the way one girl in particular could shock Kathy by using four-letter words . On the morning before the accident , Martinis came home about three A.N . He had been drinking , according to his wife , He slept until eight A.M. , then got up and said he was going to walk their baby son . Kathy objected strenuously . They argued , and when Kathy threatened to summon police . Martinis stormed out of the apartment and drove away . The next Kathy heard , live people were dead . Things have changed for the whole Martinis family since that day . Judge Martinis , who had been an acting statesupreme-court justice for the Bronx , has been transferred to Manhattan to spare him " embarrassment , " as one official put it . Gary has left Kathy and is living with his parents . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no outsider can say . The irony is that the uproar over his case may do more to blight his life than any legal punishment . Martinis has been convicted of assault against photographer Pomerantz and is scheduled for sentencing January 27 . But his only legal punishment to date is the revocation of his driver 's license by the Motor Vehicles department  --  which held a hearing last summer and concluded that Martinis ihns driving while intoxicated and that the accident was caused by his swinging from the right lane to the left at high speed . Among the witnesses al this hearing was a woman who had been driving behind Martinis and saw him " speeding up and slowing down , cutting in and out of the traffic lanes . " She recalled telling a toll taker on the parkway that the driver ahead " was going to kill somebody . " A week after this hearing , on July 31 , Dollinger 's office finally put the Martinis case before the grand jury . The D.A . went all out this time , calling every witness remotely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on live counts of vehicular homicide . But most legal experts believe the door has been locked on an empty barn . The City Club of New York , a watchdog of local government , prepared a legal memorandum which concluded : " The prosecution , having unsuccessfully tried the defendant for recklessness , may not now try thimt for recklessness causing death , . . . it is obvious that the district attorney 's failure to present all charges to the grand jury immediately created the legal barrier of double jeopardy . " Pleading just this , Martinis 's lawyer has succeeded in delaying the trial . It will .
