IN a scene that is symbolic of new directions in modern dance , Astarte , the moon goddess , writhes in passionate triumph over the spent form of the mortal who seduced her . The action is bathed in lights and film images that glide , collide and dissolve in a psychedelic pattern to the crash of rock rhythms . This ascendant moment in Robert Joffrey 's ballet Astarte appears on the cover of this issue almost exactly as it is seen by audiences .

Then at another performance , with a telephoto lens , he made the closeup of Miss Singleton 's face and the filmed background in order to complete his final montage . <P> Getting the pictures for the color pages that run with the cover story presented similar technical and artistic problems .

Hoisting himself back onstage , he tried to recover his fallen armor , only to be thrust forward again by the spear of the young man behind him . The audience convulsed ; Ray fled . <P> Researcher Mary Cronin , whose childhood experience with dance was limited to ballet lessons , revisited for this story many choreographers and dancers whom she had met five years ago while working on a Rockefeller Fund project examining economic problems of the performing arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inflicted with a recurring dream in which she was forced to dance in slippers far too large before a vast audience .
