txt President Johnson called on North Vietnam and the Vietcong today to abandon aggression , and he held out the prospect of an intensified air and ground war if they did not . Mr. Johnson 's statement , which he read at a news conference , was one of his toughest on the war since he assumed office two and a half years ago . It seemed designed to put the Communists on notice that they Should not expect either political turmoil in South Vietnam or criticism at home of the Administration 's policy to force him to alter course . Cites Foe 's Expectations " I must frankly tell you , " Mr. Johnson said , " that our intelligence indicates that the aggressor presently bases his hopes more on political differences in Saigon and Washington than on his military capacity in South Vietnam . " Opening statement , Page 56 . " While we do have differences and divisions , " he added , " I want our men in the field and our people at home to know that our course is resolute ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be diverted from doing what is necessary in the nation 's interest and the cause Of freedom . " The President said he believed " our people are determined to see this through . " He went on : " In recent primaries , not one candidate was able to make // opposition to the resistance of aggression in South Vietnam a successful position . A minority of our people are willing to pull out . Another minority are pre- , pared to see us use our total power , including our nuclear power . " The rest of us , while we may debate this or that dimension of policy , are determined that this nation honor its responsibiity and its commitment to help Vietnam turn back aggression from the north . " Mr. Johnson said the United States must " go forward as nations and men have always gone forward in dark moments , confident that when they are right , they will prevail . " I am confident that we shall gain an honorable peace in South . Vietnam , " he declared . The President read his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his oval office at the White House . Before he got to it , he read a number of others , lolling back in the big green swivel chair behind his desk . When he got to the statement on Vietnam , he sat upright and read directly into a microphone on his desk . After the session in his office , he went to the White House theater and repeated the statement before television cameras . Expected to Please ' Hawks ' The President 's statement was expected to give more comfort to the " hawks " than to the " doves " in the national controversy over the war in Vietnam . The White House assessment of the President 's recent drop in popularity , as evidenced by the public-opinion polls , is that critics of his Vietnam policy who want him to step up the war to win a quick victory outnumber those who want him to pull out . Declaring that the United States would persist in bringing to bear " the ground , naval and air strength required to achieve our objective , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting the amount of military power that the United States might employ . " I must observe that this does not mean that we shall not increase our forces or our operations , " he said . " It is not good national policy publicly to declare to those conducting aggression that there are particular limits on how we shall act to defeat that aggression . " Burden on North Grows Later in the statement , he said : " Our attacks on military targets in North Vietnam have imposed a growing burden on those who support the insurgency in the south . We must continue to raise the cost of aggression at its source , of that is the sole purpose of our use of air strength against selected military targets . " Asked during the question period whether that meant a stepup in air strikes was in the offing , the President declined to commit himself . Question 13 Similarly , when asked whether he thought expanded military activities would increase the risk of widening the war , Mr. Johnson said he did not want to " get fenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible as to strategy . Question 15 Secretary of Defense Robert S. said June 11 that 18,000 more American troops would go to Vietnam within 45 days . That would bring the total to 285,000 . Although he would not predict what the future build-up would be , there has been persistent speculation that American troop strength will reach 400,000 by the end of 1966 . Pentagon sources said June 7 that a major United States ' offensive to secure principal highways in South Vietnam awaited the arrival , scheduled by the end of the year , of about 100,000 more American troops . The President concluded his statement with a declaration plainly aimed at the Governments of North Vietnam and Communist China , although he mentioned neither by name . Few governments , he said , did not want peace in Vietnam . " To those few I would say this , " Mr. Johnson continued . " There is honor for all in making peace . Let the killing stop . " The President called on Hanoi to look at the economic and social progress elsewhere in Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the wave of the future ? Is it aggression ? Is it for one nation to conquer another ? Or is it for us all to work together as brothers in growing more food , building more schools , and providing good health to all the people ? " I believe it is the latter . " No Encouragement on Talks In answer to a question , the President said that he had " no information that I could make available that would give you any encouragement ... for prospects of negotiations to end the war . Question 4 . He said that he was encouraged by steps being taken toward constitutional government in South Vietnam . He cautioned that continued ferment could be expected as rival political forces contend for power . He also said that important economic steps were being taken to curb inflation , get more goods into the hands of the people and advance the Saigon Government 's program of revolutionary development . Mr. Johnson announced that Robert Komer , a Special Assistant to the President , would go to Saigon tomorrow to confer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruction program . Later , he said , Cabinet members will go to Saigon to see what can be done to improve and speed up agricultural , educational and health programs and action to elect a representative Government .
