Strauss : Die Fledermaus ( Hilde Gueden , Erika Kth , Regina Resnik , Giuseppe Zampiere ; the Vienna Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan ; London , 3 LPs ) . This otherwise fine recording of the imperishable operetta classic offers a strange side effect . One moment , the listener is tapping his feet to the most tap-pable of old Viennese waltzes ; the next , he is caught up in the English rhymes of I Could Have Danced All Night , sung by Birgit Nilsson , of all people , in ponderous and chesty style . In the midst of the second act party scene , the producers have inserted anachronistic " entertainments " sung by some of opera 's grandest names-Giulietta Simionato and Ettore Bastianini wander through Anything You Can Do , Leontyne Price sings Summertime from Porgy and Bess . " Gershwin ? " quips the introductory dialogue . " But Gershwin is n't even born yet . " The gag , unfortunately , dies with the first listening . <P> Shostakovich : Symphony No. 9 ( London Symphony , under Sir Malcolm Sargent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most ebullient , eccentric and delightful of Shostakovich 's works . When the composer 's orchestra-raucous , slapdash and happy-moves into battle , the effect is of a regiment under fluttering pennons posting to the attack . <P> Frank Glazer Plays Musical Autographs ( Concert-Disc ) . The musical calling cards of the great composers as they were inscribed in various souvenir albums . Included are Mozart 's Marche Funebre del Signor Maestro Contrapunto ( Funeral March of Master Counterpoint ) , a mock-heroic exercise for his pupil , Babette Ployer ; Beethoven 's graceful and pensive Bagatelle for Therese Malfatti , the 18-year-old niece of his doctor ; Wagner 's Ankunft bei den Schwarzen Schwnen ( Arrival at the Black Swans ) , which sounds a little like Tristan und Isolde as written by Frdric Chopin . <P> Brahms : Concerto No. 2 ( Sviatoslav Richter , piano ; the Chicago Symphony under Erich Leinsdorf ; RCA Victor ) . In this first Richter recording made in the U.S. , the great Russian pianist gives a performance as taut as a bent bow . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Please explain to the orchestra that I could do no better . " Nor could anyone . <P> Paisiello : The Barber of Seville ( Grazielli Sciutti , Nicola Monti , Rolando Panerai , Renato Capecchi ; Virtuosi di Roma , conducted by Renato Fasano ; Mercury , 2 LPs ) . " He has received the homage of his age and has assured to himself that of posterity . " Thus Giovanni Paisiello ( 1740-1816 ) paid tribute to himself in a contemporary dictionary . Unfortunately for his prediction , a rival named Rossini later wrote his own Barber of Seville and drove the older work from the stage . In this recording , Paisiello 's Barber emerges as a smaller-scaled work than Rossini 's but with a gay , quicksilvery score , some limpidly graceful airs , and several scenes of truly inspired buffoonery . Soprano Sciutti , fresh-voiced and fanciful , makes Rosina seem one of the most appealing heroines in opera .
