The most interesting shop talk for New York City journalists for the past few years has concerned the death , rebirth or merger of their papers . Last week the gossip was at least partially confirmed-but not by one of the papers ' own reporters . It came from Gabe Pressman , a ubiquitous newsman for NBC television . Pressman reported " top secret negotiations " involving a merger of the morning Herald Tribune and the two afternoon papers , the World-Telegram and Sun and the Journal-American . <P> Financial Woes . The publishers confirmed Pressman 's scoop , but they were not offering any details . Best guess , however , was that Scripps-Howard 's Telly and Hearst 's J-A would merge , quite possibly under the editorial direction of the Journal . That would leave the New York Post the only other remaining afternoon paper . In addition , the Sunday edition of the Trib would combine with the Journal 's Sunday paper ( the Telly has no Sunday edition ) . At the same time , the papers are exploring the possibility of combined printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new $25 million plant . Hopefully , these new arrangements would enable the papers to compete more successfully with the front-running-and money-making - News and Times . <P> The necessity for such drastic change stems from 1963 's 114-day strike and the subsequent wage settlements , which have cost the New York papers an extra $25 million a year . Moreover , the intransigence of Bertram A. Powers ' printers ' union has prevented any agreement on automation-a must for survival . It was Powers who brought the publishers together . During the strike , they got in the habit of seeing one another regularly and discussing their financial woes . " They ca n't fool each other any more , " says one newspaper executive . " They know perfectly well who 's making or losing what . " <P> Around the Horn . The papers ' difficulties go deeper than Bert Powers . At a time when city dailies are fast dwindling , New York still has six of them-more than any other city in the U.S. But suburban papers , newsmagazines and radio and television have cut deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From 1955 to 1964 , the circulation of the Trib dropped from 340,462 to 307,674 , the Journal sagged from 653,291 to 538,057 , the Telegram from 570,275 to 403,340 , the Post from 399,886 to 329,523 ; in that period , the Times rose 117,759 , to 652,135 , and the News climbed 33,445 , to 2,170,373 . Meanwhile , production wage costs at all the papers have jumped an estimated 23% and the price of newsprint has risen 4% . The Trib , Telegram and Journal stand to lose a total $15 million this year . <P> A decision on a merger could come as early as this summer . " They 're really driving for a solution , " says a top newspaper union official . " They 've gone around the horn on all possibilities . " Says Scripps-Howard President Jack R. Howard : " To this end , there will be more , rather than fewer talks . "
