txt Silversmiths have been served a pleasant surprise . They boosted the price of sterling-silver tableware by 20-25 percent last month  --  and sales went up slightly . The price increase was due to nearly a 40 percent hike in their raw material  --  silverwhen the government changed its silver policy . " All the publicity in connection with silver seems to have increased interest , " notes one sales executive . Another , Raymond J. Artabasy of Gorham Company , suspects consumers may reckon that the price of silver will go up further and thus are buying silverware now . However , neither man was certain the favorable trend would be maintained . " We wo n't really know ? until Christmas is past , " says Mr. Artabasy . Over a longer period , brides and others may turn to cheaper stainless steel . Silversmiths , therefore , hope that when the Joint Commission on Coinage holds its next meeting Sept. 18 , it will remove the ban on melting silver coins . This probably would depress silver prices . American Motors Company troubles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a two-year extension of its UAW contract . But the union will make no special concessions until after its current bargaining with the Big Three automakers is wrapped up . It 's a matter of strategy : The union is reluctant to do anything to make American Motors more competitive in a tightening auto market , while the UAW is bidding for a bigger bite into Big Three profits . But before the end of the year , the likelihood is that the union will make concessions to AMC in an effort to secure the firm 's 17,745 UAW jobs . How will Britain 's consumer market respond to the stimulus of loosened credit ? Installment buying is expected to rise by ? 100 million ( $280 million ) . Car sales already have begun to pick up momentum . Stretching out the period for repaying loans from 21/2 years to three , and whittling down payments from 30 to 25 percent , should speed up the acceleration . Instead of trailing along below the 1966 level of 1,068,000 cars , output should spurt to 1.1 million for the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 1966 level . But it thinks a further easing of credit terms will be needed to bring back the good old days of 1963 and ' 64 . The next government step may be to remove the 10 percent surcharge on purchase taxes which it imposed in July last year . Timing ? Possibly January , 1968 . How and why ... Economists term President Johnson 's proposed 10 percent tax surcharge a " progressive " tax measure . That is , it is n't " regressive . " It soaks the rich more than the poor because the rich already pay higher income-tax rates . But it wo n't be progressive enough to cancel out altogether " regressive " features of the 1964 income-tax cut and subsequent increases in social-security taxes . If the 10 percent surcharge is imposed , the individual declaring an income of $50,000 will pay $1,089 less taxes than he did in 1963 . The $25,000 man will pay $325 less , the $15,000 person $58 less . The relatively poor wo n't do badly , either . The man with a $5,000 income will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 payments . It 's the middle class who are being slapped harder than in 1963 . The $8,000 bracket will fork over $33 more , and the $10,000 man an extra $13 .

But by getting oil-import quotas , it has been able to direct from foreign-oil producers at a lower price . . But now a Stanford Research Institute report , just released , and paid for by nine American oil firms , maintains that the petrochemical industry does n't need oil imports . It predicts there will be enough domestic oil available for the industry until at least 1975 at prices that are " internationally competitive . " The study runs counter to a recent Commerce Department survey which states that American petrochemical firms could make their products cheaper . and sell many more abroad if they could import foreign oil . Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall , administrator of the oil-import program , is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
