subsequent theory about Lintzie 's suspicions of Lonnie was that without me ( or anyone else ) to talk to , he was left entirely with his thoughts , and his world was very small . He had a wife , two kids who gave him no pleasure , and the clientele of his store for whom he had no respect . And of course he had the memories of his ten months as a private in the Marine Corps , patrolling railway stations and piers and being sneered at by sailors and petty officers ; occasional visits to whorehouses along the Eastern Seaboard ; the time he stood frozen at attention when the President of the whole Gott damn United States passed within two feet of him at the Union Depot in Washington . His brother had never been as far as New York , his father had never been as far as Philadelphia , his mother had never even been to Reading before she was thirty .

Schmelinger himself was a strict Roman Catholic who had a daughter a nun and a son studying for priesthood . It was in these surroundings that Lintzie was spending a great deal of his time , probably as much of it as in his own store . A full year and a little more passed during which I did not have a drink with Lintzie and actually did not set foot in his store . ( My mother could send one of my brothers for those last-minute quarts of milk . ) I was getting twenty dollars a week on the paper , and the owner , in his benevolence , allowed me to fill the tank of my fourcylinderBuick at the paper 's expense . So I was coming up in the world , and I loved my column , which was one of the numerous imitationsof F.P.A. 's Conning Tower . One afternoon , after the paper had gone to press and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the city editor 's desk and I went to answer it . " Malloy speaking , " I said . " Oh , it 's you , Malloy . This is Christine Fultz . " " Hello , Chris , what have you got ? " I said . She was a " correspondent " who picked up a few dollars a week for news tips and unreadable ( and usually outdated ) accounts of church suppers . " Well , I 'll tell you , there 's something very funny going on out here . " " Is it funny enough to go in my column ? " " What column is that ? " said Chris . " Never mind . What have you got ? Spill it . " " I want the credit for the tip , mind you . "  | " I 'll see that you get the credit for the tip , but first you have to tell me what tip on what , " I said . " It 's at Lintzie 's . There 's a whole crowd of people standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale . " " Be serious . Somebody said he shot her . " " Lintzie shot Lonnie ? " " That 's what I said , did n't I ? But I do n't know if it 's true or not . I could n't get very near , there 's such a crowd . There was another story circulating that he shot her and the two children , but I do n't know that either . " " Are the police there ? " I said . " If they are , they 're inside . I did n't see no police . " " When did this happen , do you know ? " " Well , it could n't of happened very long ago , because I went past Lintzie 's an hour ago and there was nobody there . But when I came back you should of seen the crowd . So it must of happened between the time I went past there an hour ago and when I was on my way home .

" " That 's the old noodle again , Chris . Well , thanks very much . You 'll get credit for the tip . " " Are you coming out ? " " Try and stop me , " I said . In less than ten minutes I parked my car across the street from Lintzie 's . It was my neighborhood , and everyone knew that I was working on the paper , so they made way for me . A cop , the newest on the force , got between me and the door . " No newspaper reporters , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Get out of my way . If you 'll turn your thick head around you 'll see your boss waving to me to come in . " Inside the store Joe Dorelli , a sergeant and detective  --  all detectives were sergeants  --  was signaling to me . " You see ? " I said top102the rookie cop . " I was covering murders when you were playing high school football . " It was a lie , but rookie cops were our natural enemies . I went inside . " What the hell is this , Joe ? " " Lintzie , the Dutch bastard . He come home and caught her in bed with a guy and he shot them . Then the kids come running in from the yard and he shot them too . You want to see the gun ? Here 's the gun . " On the counter was a holster stamped USMC and in it was a Colt .45 automatic pistol . " Where is Lintzie ? " I said . " Back in the kitchen , talking to the chief . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He phoned in . Me and the chief come right out and the first thing he done was offer us a cigar . Then he took us upstairs and showed us the wife and the boy friend . Wait 'll you see them . We 're waiting for the fellow to come and take their pictures . Then Lintzie took us down in the cellar and showed us the two kids . " " He shot them down in the cellar ? " " No , on the stairway , between this floor and the bedroom . Then he carried them down in the cellar . I do n't know why , and he does n't either . I said to him why did n't he shoot himself while he was at it ? That 's what they often do . But he was surprised at such a question . Why should he shoot himself ? He looked at me like I was n't all there . " " Is he drunk ? " " You can smell it on him , but he do n't act it . He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By name , " said Dorelli . " That 's what I wanted to talk to you . Did you know this was gon na happen ? Nobody knows who the guy is . Well , we know his name and he was some kind of a salesman . His wallet was in his pants pocket , hanging on the back of a chair . From Wilkes-Barre , he is , but working for a company over in Allentown . Sidney M. Pollock , thirty-two years of age . But did you know about him and the Lintz woman ? " " No , but I might recognize him . " " We 'll get him identified all right . " " I 'd like to take a look at him . " " From the front you would . You know what a .45 slug 'll do . The right-hand cheekbone it went in . She got it in the heart . Two . He gave her one for good measure . The kids he gave one apiece . Five shots , four dead . But he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took notice there was a picture of him in the bedroom . Marksman and expert rifleman . Well , do you want to take a look at them ? " I only wanted to see the dead man , and I did recognize him . He was the companion of the traveling salesman who had talked so seductivelyof Lonnie Lintz . Even after a year there was no mistaking that nose and that hairless skull . I could not have recognized the bigmouthsalesman ; he had been sitting on my right ; but Pollock had been facing him , and me . It was perhaps too much to say that if I had struck up a conversation with them that night , Pollock would not now he lying dead in his underwear on a messy bed in a strange town , in disgrace . I thought of Pollock 's wife , if any , and his probably orthodoxmother and father in Wilkes-Barre . " Now you got another treat in store for you , " said Dorelli . " Down in the cellar . " " No thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorelli . " I had to , but if I did n't have to I would n't have . Two kids , for Christ 's sake , around the same age as two of mine . This guy is crazy , but do n't you write that . That 's what he 'll claim  --  and maybe he had a right to kill her and the Jew , but not the kids . He ca n't pull that unwritten law on the kids . For that he deserves to fry . " " I did n't know you were such a family man , Joe . " " Listen , what you do n't know about me would fill a book , " he said . " You had enough , we 'll go down and see if the chief 'll let you talk to Lintz . " I waited in the store while Joe conferred with the chief . A cop named Lundy came in while I was there . " That 's something you do n't often hear in this town , " he said . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , they want to lynch him . " " We 've never had a lynching in this town , " I said . " We never will . It 's just talk , but you do n't often hear that kind of talk in Lantenengo County . Just talk , but all the same I 'm gon na tell the chief to get him outa here . " " You mean you 're thinking of suggesting to the chief , " I said . " Aah , smart guy , " said Lundy . " I hear Lintz and you was great buddies . " " Doing some detective work at Schmelinger 's , eh , Lundy ? Do you think you 'll solve this case ? "  | " I 'll solve you one right in the puss , Malloy , " said Lundy . " Then you 'll be right back on the garbage truck . We supported this mayor , " I said . Dorelli , at the rear of the store , beckoned to me . " Any message you wish me to convey to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would n't get it right , just like that rag you work for , " said Lundy . He laughed and I laughed . Lundy was a good cop and he knew I thought so . " I 'll put in a good word for you , then , " I said . " Jesus , do n't do that . That 'd be the ruination of me , a good word from you . " I joined Dorelli . " You can talk to him , but one of us has to be there . " " Oh , come on , Joe . There 's no mystery about this case . Let me talk to him alone . " " We 'll do it our way or not at all , " said Dorelli . " Then we 'll do it your way , " I said . Dorelli led me to the kitchen . A uniformed cop was standing outside the kitchen door ; the chief was sitting across the table from Lintzie , his chin on his chest , staring at him in silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask Lintzie . Lintzie turned when I entered . " Oh , there 's my buddy . Hyuh , Malloy . " " Hello , Lintzie , " I said . " Say , Chief , let me send over to Schmelinger 's for a pint , " said Lintzie . " I 'll pay for it . " " Pay for it ? You got a lot to pay for , you son of a bitch , " said the chief . " I 'll be down in the cellar , " said Dorelli , and left . " Well , I guess I went and done it , " said Lintzie . " How did you happen to pick today ? " I said . " I do n't know , " said Lintzie . " I was over at Schmelinger 's and I guess I started to thinking to myself . There was a whole truckload of stuff piled up on the kitchen porch , waiting to be unpacked . I knowed Gott damn well Lonnie would n't start unpacking it . It had to be unpackedand put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to myself if I got it all unpacked I could make the kids take it down in the cellar when they got home . It was a truckload of stuff from the wholesaler . Canned goods . Heavy . In wooden boxes . All I needed was my clawhammerand I could unpack the stuff and the kids could take it down the cellar a couple cans at a time . Ten or fifteen minutes ' work for mep105and I could be back at Schmelinger 's . So I said to Gus I 'd see him later and I come home . " " What time was that , Lintzie ? " I said . " Search me . I lost track of time , " said Lintzie . " About quarter of three , " said the chief . " Between half past two and three , according to Schmelinger . " " I come in the store door , and I took notice to the salesman 's car outside . But I went inside and no Lonnie , and no salesman . The chief do n't believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only it was n't the same one . " " Why do n't you believe him , Chief ? " " Because this was a deliberate murder . All this stuff about the packages on the back porch , that 's the bunk . " " Look outside , the boxes are there right now in plain sight , " said Lintzie . " He pretended he was going to spend a couple hours at Schmelinger 's , the way he usually did . But he only went there long enough to give his wife and the salesman time to go upstairs , " said the chief . " He admitted himself he usually kept the .45 upstairs but today he had it hanging on a peg in the cellar stairway . This was a planned firstdegreemurder . " " How about that , Lintzie ? " I said . " The chief do n't have to be right all the time . " " But why was the gun hanging in the stairway ? " " To get it out of the way of the kids . Lonnie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it out of the way . So I took and hung it on a peg in the cellar stairway , where he could n't reach it . That was two-three days ago . Lonnie could  --  I was just gon na say Lonnie could back me up on that , but I guess not now . " " No , " I said . " So then what ? " " Yes , listen to this part , Malloy , " said the chief . " Then what ? Then I went upstairs and caught them in bed . " " Wait a minute , Lintzie . You 're skipping a lot . Did you get the gun and then go upstairs ? " I said . " Me ? No . I went upstairs and caught them and then I got the gun . " " Did you , before you went upstairs , did you call Lonnie to see where she was ? Upstairs or down-cellar ? " " Well , she could hear the bell when I come in the store . " " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , or did you ? "  | " He did n't call her , and he did n't come in the front door , " said the chief . " He told Dorelli one story and me another , and now he 's an altogether different one . He told Dorelli he went around the back way and got his claw-hammer and started opening the boxes . There 's no mark of a claw-hammer on any of the boxes , and anyway you make a certain amount of noise opening a wooden box with a claw-hammer . You know , you put the claws under the slats and you start using leverageand it makes a peculiar kind of a noise . But that would have warned the people upstairs . No , he came in the back door , where there is no bell , and he got the .45 and sneaked upstairs and took careful aim and killed the salesman . One shot . Then he let her have two slugs right in the heart . I had a look at the .45 and I 'll tell you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns in as good a condition I 'd be satisfied . I know something about guns . If you leave a gun in a holster for any length of time , the oil gets gummy , but not this gun . This gun was cleaned and oiled I 'd say in the last twenty-four , fortyeighthours . " " I always kept my gun in good condition , " said Lintzie . " Yes . For just such an occasion , " said the chief . " Tell me what you did , Lintzie , " I said . " I shot them , for Christ 's sake . And then the Gott damn kids come yelling and screaming and I shot them , too . I ai n't denying it . Go ahead and arrest me . " " Oh , we 'll arrest you , Mr. Lintz , " said the chief . " You were arrested , nearly an hour ago . Sergeant Dorelli placed you under arrest , but you do n't have a very good memory . " " You shot the kids on the stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the cellar . " " That 's what I done . Yeah . " " But I understand that a bullet from a .45 has a terrific impact , that it 'll knock a grown man back several feet . So I was wondering , maybe when you shot the kids the impact knocked them down the stairs , and then you picked them up and carried them to the cellar . Is that about right , Lintzie ? " " No , " he said . " What did happen ? " " I held the kids , one at a time , and shot them , " said Lintzie . " Jesus , " I said , and looked at the chief . " They would n't hold still , " he said . " Jesus Christ , " I said . " Oh , this is quite a fellow , " said the chief . " It takes a real man top107grab hold of a kid with one hand and shoot him with the other . And do the same thing all over again with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lintzie ? The girl or the boy ? " " Her . Then he come at me . I do n't remember holding him . " " The boy tried to defend his sister , " said the chief . " He did n't try to defend nobody , that kid . He was getting ready to shoot me . Him and Lonnie . " " But I thought Lonnie told you to hide the gun , " I said . " Till he got older , that 's all . She was gon na wait a couple years till we had more money saved up . " " Oh , and then she was going to let him shoot you ? " I said . " You got the idea , " said Lintzie . He grinned at me and sneered at the chief . " She thought I was dumb , but I was n't so dumb . " " You said something about catching her with another man once before , " I said . " You never told me about that . " " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never told me that . When did you catch her ? Was it like today , you came home and found her with another man ? " " Night , " he said . " Oh , you came home one night and found her ? " " No ! I was home . Upstairs . The night bell rang and she went down to see who it was . " " You thought it was a late customer , " I said . " I thought it was , but it was a foreigner . He had whiskers and he wore those funny clothes . You know . He had whiskers on his chin , all the girls were stuck on him . " " Oh , yes . Once I had a billygoat , he was old enough to vote . He had whiskers on his chin . I remember the song . " " This was him , though . Not a song . " " Oh , really ? And he came in the store and made passes at Lon-nie ? " " She made passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't like you , or your mother , or any of you . Boy , oh , boy , the things she used to say about your old man . " " She never knew my old man , but what did she say about him ? " " How he used to operate on people when they did n't have nothingwrong with them . Any time your old lady wanted a new dress , your old man would operate on somebody . " " Oh , well that was true , of course , " I said . " Stop humoring him , " said the chief . " And that 's why Lonnie never made passes at me , because shep108did n't like us . But what about this foreigner with the beard , Lintzie ? Did you ever see him any place else ? Did you ever see him at Schmel-inger 's ? " " He used to come in there but I never talked to him . " " He did come in there , though ? " " I seen him there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wear a kind of a coat with little straps across the front ? " " Such a coat , yes , " said Lintzie . " But I never seen him when you were there . " " No , but I think I knew the fellow you mean . " The chief looked at his gold hunting-case watch . " You had long enough , Malloy . I 'm taking this fellow down to the squire 's office . " " Charging him with first-degree murder ? " I said . " We sure are . An open-and-shut case , like this watch . " " I 'll make you a small bet he never goes to Bellefonte , " I said . " I would n't take your money , " said the chief . " Bellefonte ? Where the electric chair is ? " said Lintzie . " Huh . Not me . " " See ? He does n't think so either , " I said . " Who did I used to guard during the war ? Tell him , Malloy , " said Lintzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gott damn United States , " I said . " Can I go upstairs a minute , Chief ? " said Lintzie . " No . You mean you want to go to the toilet ? " " No , I want to get something for Malloy . " " Call Lundy , tell him what it is and he 'll get it , " said the chief . " My picture of me , upstairs on the bureau , " said Lintzie . " Oh , for Christ 's sake . All right , " said the chief . Lundy went upstairs and brought down the photograph , which I had never seen before , of Private Donald Lintz , U.S.M.C. , in his greens and the old-style cap that sat squarely on the top of his head . two badges for shooting pinned to the blouse . " Put that in the paper , Malloy , " said Lintzie . " That I promise you , " I said . " And how about pictures of Lonnieand the kids ? " " You want them too ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want them in the paper . " " Are there any more up there , Lundy ? " I said.  | " Sure , " said Lundy . " Plenty . Her before she got fat , and the two kids . " " No , you ca n't have them , " said Lintzie . " Get them , Lundy , " said the chief . " You son of a bitch , Malloy , " said Lintzie . " You want to make people feel sorry for them . " " Maybe he does n't , but I do , " said the chief . " Malloy , why do you think this fellow has a Chinaman 's chance ? You can tell me . The D.A . prosecutes , I do n't .

" Maybe you 're right , " said the chief . " You , Malloy ? " " Not on the house , " I said . " You 've just lost your best cash cus-tomer . " " I wo n't miss him , " said Schmelinger .

Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , " said the chief . We walked in silence halfway to Lintzie 's , then the chief spoke . " I thought a great deal of your father . What 's a young fellow with your education throwing it all away when you could be doing some good in the world ? " " What education ? I had four years of high school , " I said . " You were away to college , " he said . " Away , but not to college . " " Oh , then you 're not much better than the rest of us , " he said.  | " I never said I was , Chief .

" That you , Charles ? " his wife called from the sitting-room . " It 's me , " he said , and muttered to himself , " somewhat the worse for wear .

That was Geraldine St. John . " " The English girl . Are you sure ? " " You 'll never get it out of your head that it was n't Peggy Joyce , but it was n't . It was Geraldine St. John . " " She was n't even an actress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's any Epsom salts , " she said . " She had been an actress , though . " " No , she wanted to be an actress . She was thinking of becoming one . " " Well , whichever it was , she had some reason for buttering you up . " " She was n't buttering me up , " he said . " She was doing her best to seduce me . I was so darned attractive in those days , you must have gone through hell . But fortunately I was a man of strong character ,  |p115and  very much in love with you . I think of all the women that went on the make for me , and how resolutely I spurned them . " " There 's only a half a boxful of Epsom salts . Do you think that 'll be enough ? " " Oh , sure . Five pounds to a box . Two and a half pounds ought to be enough . The important thing is to have the water hot . The Epsomsalts do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . " fie was naked . " Turn around , " she said . " Where did you hit yourself ? " " Is n't there a bruise ? " " Not on the coccyx bone . There 's a red mark here , on the left hip , but the skin is n't broken . Do you want me to put something on it ? Why do n't I wait till you 've had your tub , and then I 'll use some rubbing alcohol on it . Your clothing protected you , softened the im-pact . " " If I do n't get in the tub you 'll be a quivering mass of frustrated passion . " " I know , " she said . " Shall I bring your drink in the bathroom ? " " Trying to get me drunk , too . That 's what Geraldine St. John tried to do , but it got her nowhere . Absolutely nowhere . " " I 'm relieved to know it , after all these years , " she said . He put a foot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot ? " she said . " Just put your hand in and see , " he said . " I 'll take your word for it . Turn on the cold . " " Is that the way it 's done ? " he said . " You wanted it hot . " " It 's a good thing I did n't put both feet in . " She turned on the cold water , knelt on the floor and made a whirlpool with a scrubbing brush . " Do n't catch cold , " she said . " Put something on . " " You do n't have to look . " " I know , but put on your bathrobe anyway , " she said . " Do n't get it too cold . " " I 'm going to make it medium temperature and then you can change it to suit yourself , once you get in . It really is n't terribly hot , you know . Your feet were cold , but I think you can stand it now . " " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're always cold , and you 've been out in the snow into the bargain , " she said.  |p116Now  he put one foot , then the other , in the water and lowered himself into the tub . " How is it ? " she said . " It 'll be all right . Thanks . " " I 'm going to fill the hot-water bottle . I suggest you go right to bed after your bath . It 's been a shock and sleep is the best thing for it . I 'll leave your drink in the bedroom . " " Where are you going ? " " I think I 'll go down and put the meat back in the deep-freeze . I want you to soak in the hot tub for at least a half an hour , and then go right to bed . We 'll wait and see how you feel around nine o'clock . If you 're still asleep , fine . If not , we can have dinner then . " " All right , " he said . As he lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he could hear her moving about in the small house . She came in once at the end of fifteen minutes . " You all right ? " she said . " Completely relaxed , " he said . " Take another fifteen minutes . I 've got the heating pad in your bed . I 'll turn it on when you 've finished your soak . I do n't want to put it on too soon . " " It 's automatic , " he said . " I know , but I do n't trust those things , " she said , and went out again . This time he noticed no thoughts , and though he did not close his eyes , he could not account for a period of five or six minutes and there was not doubt that he had in effect been asleep . " Are you done to a crisp ? " he heard her say . " Do you realize that it 's twenty years for Rex ? " " On the ninth of March , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived , we 'd have a middle-aged son . He 'd be forty-three years old . I 'll never be able to stretch my imagination that far , that you and I would have a son fortythree . Forty-three . There 's no use kidding ourselves , forty-three is n't young . " " I do n't think we kid ourselves very much , " she said . " I think you 've had enough warm water . How does your back feel ? " " I 'll know when I get up , " he said . " Here , I 'll give you a hand . " " No , I want to get up normally , use the usual muscles . That 's the only way to tell . " He got out of the tub , and she held up a bath towel for him . " Feel all right . "  | " Dry yourself and I 'll turn on the heating pad , " she said . " Do n't you want to talk about Rex ? " he said . " Not at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm bed and let you have at least an hour 's sleep . Some shut-eye . " " Some what ? " he said . " Some shut-eye , " she said . " I wonder if you realize who the first person was that we ever heard use that expression , " he said . " Shut-eye ? Was it Rex ? " " No , it was n't Rex . It was someone very different from Rex . It was Paul Vincent . " " How can you be so sure of that ? " " Because I 'm a playwright , and I listen to what people say . " " But that far back ? " " It was one of the first things I ever heard him say , and he was the first one I ever heard say it , " he said . He buttoned up his pajamas . " I do n't think I 'll open the window , " she said . " I 'll come up in an hour or so and open it if you 're asleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , Rex or Paul Vincent , " he said . " Do you ? " she said . " I have no objection to talking about Rex , " he said . " We do n't much , any more . Actually we never did . I think we 've always hoped that he might still be alive . " " I never had any such hope . Two of his friends saw his plane go down in smoke , and one of them saw it fall into the ocean . There was no reason to hope . You only tortured yourself by hoping . How did you get started thinking about him now ? " " Some of my best ideas come to me in the bathtub . Just like Archimedes . Remember , Eureka ! ' ? " " Vaguely , " she said . " So vaguely that I would have said it was Socrates . " " It was Archimedes . Archimedes , " he said . " He discovered something while taking a bath , but I do n't remember what . And I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It had nothing to do with Rex , but I made a discovery . Two discoveries , actually . One , that I can think of him without pain . And two , that it 's much better to remember him as we do than as a middleagedman of forty-three . " " Assuming he 'd die at forty-three , which I do n't assume . "  | " No , assuming that we 'll die whenever we do , and that he 'd have gone on living , to forty-five , or fifty , or whatever we are when we cash in . When I die , just before I die , one of my last thoughts will be of my son as he was the last time we saw him . Young , strong , brave , gay . And handsome . He was just old enough to be truly handsome . Nobodylooks like that when they 're forty-three . It 's gone at thirty , at the latest . We never saw him when he had to wear reading glasses , or starting to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear arch supports , or have a receding hair-line . Would you ? " " Yes . " " I wonder . You 'd want him alive . But he might have bored you , you know . He would have married a nice girl , in all likelihood . They 'd have produced three or four children , the way most of his generation have done , and you and I would n't count for much . I gave very little thought to my father and mother after you and I were married . " " Rex never would have bored me , " she said . " Are you all tucked in ? " " All tucked in , and all tuckered out , " he said . " I think I 'll sleep . " " I wo n't wake you . I 'll let you sleep as long as you can . Shall I leave the drink ? " " No , you might as well take it with you , " he said . The bedclothes were all the way up to his chin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask you a question . " " Yes , and I 'm sure I know what it is , " she said . " Well , did you ? " " Did I what ? " she said . " If you know what the question is , why do n't you answer it ? " " Because I could be wrong , " she said . " Did you sleep with Paul Vincent ? " he said . " That 's what I thought you were going to ask me . The answer is no . " " The answer has always been no , " he said . " Are you hoping that some day I 'll change no to yes ? " " No , but yes would be easier to believe than no . " " Well , I did n't , so go to sleep , " she said . " Why did n't you ? You were sore as hell at me about the St. John girl . " " Yes I was , but I was n't going to make a fool of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How did I make a fool of myself ? She was the one that was acting foolish . "  | " You were as bad as she was , in a different way . Talking with an English accent . " " My God , you should have heard yourself , parroting Paul Vincentand that lingo of his . He could n't say sleep , he had to say shuteye . What were some of the other quaint expressions he used ? He never said hands . He said lunch-hooks . " " I do n't remember that at all , " she said . " You and the rest of you , you with your gentle upbringing . You all thought he was fascinating because he talked that way . Lunchhooks . Shut-eye . Puddle-jumper . And none of it was original , althoughyou all thought it was . It all came from cartoonists and the theatrical publications . " " Next time you go for a walk in the snow , wear your creepers , " she said . " You seem to have shaken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have , " he said . " Do you want this light on ? " she said . " No thanks . " " I 'll be in to see how you 're getting along , " she said . . . Twice in the next three hours she visited the room , and on the second visit she opened the windows . Both times he was asleep , helplessagainst an attacker , and the captive of his unwanted dreams , which were seldom nightmarish but always full of complicated problemsand dilemmas . Sometimes he would wake up in the night and turn the light on and scribble a few words that were the key to involvedplots for plays . In the morning , when he was having his coffee , he would study his notes to himself and be unable to make any sense out of them . " Beautifully logical plot , a well-constructed , logical threeactplay , " he would say . But he had not written a play in at least ten years . They did not need the money . Back in the Twenties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that together had made him close to a million dollars . Bob Abercrombie had investedthe money for him , and his capital was now past the million mark . She , Emily Kinsmith , had an income of her own . " A good thing , too , " he would say . " I could never make a living in the theater today . Actually I should n't even call myself a playwright any more . I 'd have just as much right to call myself a wrestler . I wrestled in college and got a minor letter . But it 's almost as long since I 've writtena play as it is since I helped beat M.I.T. on the mat . " " Except that I have a feeling you were better known as a playwrightthan as a wrestler . " " You tell that to one of the new managers , " he said.  |p120They  lived the year round in the house that had once been their summer cottage , out beyond East Hampton on Long Island . A drama critic on Newsweek once referred to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composing several letters of correction , none of which he mailed . " After all , how can I be sure he is n't right ? " said Charles . Someone at the Dramatists Guild , an associate professor at the University of Michigan , and a woman at the Pasadena Playhouse wrote to the magazine to set it straight . Excerpts of their letters were printed . Several East Hampton friends said they too had written , but their letters were not published . " Probably because they never actuallygot written , " said Charles . " Well , you know how people are , " said Emily . " Oh , yes . I know how people are , " said Charles . Just before Christmas they would go to New York on a Monday and stay until Thursday afternoon . " That gives us a chance to see four plays , including one matinee . But last year we were driven to going to a musical comedy . There just were n't four plays I wanted to see . I do n't want to see a play in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . It happens not far from here , every weekend all summer long . It happened when I was in college . I do n't even mind plays about homosexuals . But you can do a play about homosexuals without having one character kiss the other on the mouth . The minute you succumb to that temptation , you admit you have n't got much of a play . You have a little shocker , and that 's all . I 've had adultery in four or five of my plays , but there 's never been a bed on the set . That would have been quite a temptation to some of my actors and actresses , and I may have been unconsciously guided by prudence . Think of the magnetic attraction a bed would have had for Lita Pastorius , for instance . If we 'd had a bed on the set she would n't have been able to take her eyes off it . But knowing that there was an imaginary bed offstage , she gave a very convincing performance . The actors have to imagine things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had George Fleming 's glass filled with a real Martini and he just drank it down without any enjoyment . It was an experiment . He said himself he preferred plain water onstage . With plain water , he could act . But he was so used to real Martinis in real life that when we gave him one in the play , he did n't react . He was supposed to say , This is a fine cocktail , ' and it was . I mixed it . But he read the line so unconvincinglythat we went back to plain water , and I want to tell you that when an actor turns down a free drink it 's something to think about , " he said.  |p121East  Hampton was far enough away from New York to provide excuses for Charles to stay in the country . To take the morning train he would have to rise at five o'clock ; by motor the trip was tiresome and long , through the business sections of the Suffolk County villages and the monotonous parkways of Nassau . In emergencies  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expense that he could justify only in rather extreme cases . " What constitutes an extreme case ? " he would say . " Well , an actor 's funeral , if the actor was in one of my plays and I was still speaking to him , or her , at the end of the run . Or a favorite waiter , if I hear about his funeral in time . The trouble there , of course , is that I seldom knew their last names and I do n't always hear about their dying . I go to a restaurant and find out months later . I used to go to critics ' funerals , but the critics that reviewedmy plays are no longer around . Benchley . Hammond . Mantle . Anderson , Gabriel . Woollcott . I did n't feel I had to go to Nathan 's funeral . He was never really a critic . Some funerals mean staying in town overnight . Personal friends . But I find that I have n't nearly as many personal friends as I once had . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about it till I read it in the alumni magazine . Nothing in the New York papers . On the other hand , when my tailor died there was quite a lengthy obit in both papers , in which I was mentioned as one of his customers . I did n't go to his funeral . He 'd been overcharging me for years because he knew damn well I was too lazy to break in someone else . A lot of men my age have stopped having things custom-made . We buy off the rack when we buy at all . It 's too depressing to be reminded that a really good suit or pair of shoes will outlast you . My present dinner jacket is thirty-two years old , and I guess that tells as well as anything else could how much we go out in the evening . Every four or five years I buy one of those white linen dinner jackets for the summer festivities . The summer festivities consist of sixteen dinner parties and four appearances at the John Drew Theater . I 'm quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking through old appointment books of Emily 's . It comes out to exactly sixteen a summer , as guest and host . At that it 's too many , but between Thanksgiving and Memorial Day there are hardly any . Since the War there 's been a tendency for people to keep their houses open all winter , and come down for long weekends . But the entertaining then is n't as elaborate . You do n't have to see people unless you really want to . Emily can always pretend I 'm working  --  and I am . I 'm writing the libretto of an opera . As soon as you tell people you 're writing the libretto of an opera they think twice about disturb/ing you . But it has to be an opera . An opera takes years . Sometimes they ask me if it was commissioned , and I tell them it was certainly not commissioned by the Met , and look wise . Implying that it 's a secret project . If they ask me the name of the composer I tell them that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be modem and I make a little joke . Not by the time it 's finished , ' I tell them . It 'll never be finished , because it 's never been started , but it 's been very useful to me for ten years or more , and I 've had a great many letters about it . If I were a little more unscrupulous I could have made some money on it . One of the television companies wanted to pay me $10,000 for an option on it . That put me momentarily in a spot , but I wriggled out of it . I said if they were willing to pay me $50,000 , I 'd listen . I heard no more from them . It was somehow reassuring to learn that they would n't go to fifty . I would n't like to think that things have gotten so out of hand that a television company would pay me $5o,000 for an option on an unwritten opera . I sold one of my plays to the movies for $50,000 in 1930 , and I thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . I see it on television now and then , sometimes the first movie version and sometimes the remake , with an entirely different cast . Not to mention an entirely different story , but it always has to say , Based on the play by Charles Kinsmith . ' I want to say , What play by Charles Kinsmith , ' but Emily 's never gotten used to my habit of talking to the radio set or the television . She pretends to think I 'm batty . She does n't mind my talking out loud when I 'm actually writing dialog . She could see a reason for that . But muttering things at the TV set shows a lack of restraint that she pretends not to understand . She comes of a tight-lipped Yankee family . Ethan Frome-Calvin Coolidge types . My family were so poor that talk was practically our only form of entertainment . Nobody paid much attention to what anyone else said , but we jawed away from morning to night . It was really like talking to yourself in our house . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gabbing at once . Bedlam . And yet we somehow managed to maintain communications . It took me about two years to learn that Emily 's family were n't being so taciturn because I was a stranger . It was their way . They came to the table to eat , and they ate everything that was put on their plates , by the old man . He never asked anyone if they wanted cauliflower , or turnips . If that 's what there was , that 's what you got , and you damn well ate it . In silence , preferably . When I finally caught on , and did n't try to make conversation , everybody was more relaxed . Emily 's mother said one day , Charles , did n't you like your turnips ? ' and I said , Nope . ' That wasp123all . But from then on whenever I had a meal at their house they did n't serve turnips . Emily hated turnips , too , but she 'd never been asked . She was very well brought up , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her what she wanted , never asked her what she thought . Consequently she was very appreciative of common politenesson the part of outsiders , and if anyone was actually kind to her , or treated her with uncommon respect , or loved her  --  she was extremely appreciative . When I first met her I did n't know any of these things about her family life . She was a classmate of one of my sisters at Wellesley . Not a particularly close friend , but a classmate , and I was introduced to her at their commencement , along with a dozen other girls . As far as I was concerned , Emily was all there was . Dark and shy in her long white dress , then later when she was wearing her mortarboard it was n't on quite straight . It gave her accidentally a dash , although it was unintentional . Is there anything more unfemininethan a girl in a riding habit , with a stiff white stock and her hat on the top of her head ? And yet is there anything more feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cap and gown . If she 's strongly feminine , it 'll come through in spite of the attire , in both cases . Emily and my sister and I rode together on the New York train . I was n't getting much out of her conversationally , but I knew she liked me , and I was determined to see more of her . Then when we got back to New York we were met by her grandmother 's chauffeur , Emile , in black leather puttees and breeches and a tunic that buttoned up to the throat . That was totally unexpected . I 'd somehow got the impression that Emily was in better circumstances than we were , but not much better . I 'd pictured her father as the insurance man in a small town in Connecticut , because I knew she lived in a small town in Connecticut and that her father was in the insurance business . She 'd told me that much . But when I saw that chauffeur I began to wonder . She offered to give us a lift to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could refuse , I accepted . I wanted to find out all I could . Her grandmother 's car removedany doubt I had about Emily 's financial status . It was a big Renault limousine , with the radiator in the middle of the hood . Ugly as could be , but the effect was overwhelming . It was n't a new car , even then , but it 'd been well taken care of , and I 'd never been inside a limousine before . We were n't sure how to get to Brooklyn by car , but Emile knew . In those days a lot of people like Emily 's grandmother lived in Brooklyn , and he 'd been there oftener than we had . My uncle was a clergyman , pastor of a Dutch Reformed church on Brooklyn Heights , and Emile had actually taken people to weddings there.  |p124Emily  insisted on going with us  --  she was postponing her meeting with her grandmother , she told me later . She was terrified of her grandmother , who was her mother 's mother . Old Mrs. Van Rhyne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's marriage to Emily 's father . The fact that he had made a big success in the insurance business did n't cut much ice with her . This was all to come out much later , but apparently Mrs. Van Rhyne felt that Mr. Williams had all the Yankee virtues and none of the vices . He was shrewd and thrifty and dependable , but he would n't take a drink or look at another woman . Your true Yankee does both . I know . I went to Dartmouth for four years , and all my preconceived notions of PuritanNew Englanders went up the flue . Those Green Mountain Boys and State-of-Mainers are very fond of liquor and pussy , no matter what you hear to the contrary . Mrs. Van Rhyne did n't advocate adulteryand boozing , but she was a handsome woman herself and accustomed to flattering attentions by the male sex . She also liked her little nip . And remember that car , that big green French monster , and that dapper French chauffeur . Most of her contemporaries had PierceArrowsand ex-coachmen , usually Irish or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her daughter to go through life as a frump . Unfortunately , Mrs. Williams was a frump , and Mr. Williams was just what she wanted . A reaction , obviously to the pleasure-loving Mrs. Van Rhyne . I never knew Mr. Van Rhyne . He had passed out of the pictureby the time I came along , but I gathered from bits and pieces that I was able to pick up that he was as much in favor of ease and eleganceas she was . He never did a tap of work . He went to Columbia for two years and then to Oxford , but Mrs. Van Rhyne was always rather evasive about his Oxford career . I was curious , and I thought of writing to Oxford to try to find out if he ever actually became a member of that university . Then I decided that would be spying , so I never wrote . The Van Rhyne money was in real estate . They owned solid blocks of it in the West Seventies and Eighties , and all they had to do was sit there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died before he was forty , but people remembered him as a real sybarite . Whenever his name came up they 'd always get that look , that tolerant smile that they had when anybody 'd mention Edward VII . If you lead a completely useless life , but do it with style and die young enough , you 're quite likely to be remembered with more affection than the man who has a record of accomplishment . But the secret is to die young enough . If you think you 're going to live to a ripe old age , it 's better to pile up a record of accomplishment of some sort . It may bep125bridge-building , or money-making , or butterfly-collecting , but it has to be something . People do n't like to see longevity wasted on a donothing . And as a rule , it is n't . Do-nothings do n't usually last very long . The first twenty years of a man 's life are a struggle , getting through the childhood diseases and accidents , and the sex revolution that begins around eleven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with your parents . Those first twenty years are anything but do-nothing years . It 's the next twenty that determine whether a man is a do-nothing or an accomplisher . He knows what he wants to do , even if it 's nothing , and he sets a timer in himself that will go off when his energy is used up . I 'm convinced that most people really know just about how long they 're going to last , and they guide their lives and expend their resources accordingly . Emily 's grandfather , for instance , told Mrs. Van Rhyne that when their daughter got married he wanted his brother Curtis and not his brother William to give her away . Clearly indicating that he did n't expect to be there , and he was n't . But Emily 's mother was only about ten years old at the time . He knew . If you ask a man when he 's going to die , he wo n't be able to tell you , but he knows . I know when I 'm going to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . " " Charles ! Charles ! Wake up , darling , " said Emily Kinsmith . He opened his eyes . She was sitting on the edge of the bed and holding his hand in her two . " You were groaning , " she said . " I think it was a nightmare . " " No , I do n't remember any nightmare , " he said . " Does your back hurt ? " she said . " Maybe that was it . " He pulled himself up to a sitting position . " My back does hurt alittle , " he said . " But not while I 'm lying still . Only when I move . " " You must have been turning in your sleep . " " Maybe , " he said . " How long have I been asleep ? " " Oh , about an hour and a half . I came in a couple of times to see how you were . " " How was I ? " " Dead to the world , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsweek said so . " " Was it Newsweek ? I thought it was Time . " " You thought it was time what ? " " I thought it was Time that had you in the obituary column . " " Oh , I thought you meant it was time I woke up , " he said . " No , you sleep as long as you like . " " I do n't want to sleep any more . "  | " You want to have dinner ? " she said . " I want to talk , " he said . " All right , " she said . She fixed the pillows behind him . " Shall I get you a glass of water ? " " Yes , my mouth is dry . " She got him a tumbler of water and handed it to him . He sipped it slowly . " Do you know how it feels to be a bird ? I do n't think birds appreciate what they have . For just a fraction of a second , the tiniest fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt to be a bird today . " " When you had your fall , " she said . " Yes . When my feet left the ground , both feet , and before I came down on my behind . It was n't like jumping . I 've jumped from the top of a barn into a pile of straw and enjoyed it . But that was voluntary . This was something over which I had no control . Suddenly I was given the gift of flight . But being a member of the human species , a descendant of Pithecanthropus erectus , I could n't adapt myself to the new situation . Nevertheless I had the experience of being air-borne today , and I 'm thinking of trying it again . The question is , how ? I ca n't go up on the roof and jump off . I have to wait until Nature gives me the gift again . But I must say it was exhilarating . " " Is that what you were dreaming about ? " she said . " I was n't dreaming about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most certainly were , " she said . " You were groaning and muttering  --  " " But I was n't dreaming . I was talking to somebody . " " But you were sound asleep , talking to somebody or not talking to somebody . Who was it you were talking to ? " " I have no idea . Nobody in particular , " he said . " Me ? " " No . Nobody I ever knew . Nobody that I could identify in any way . I mean I do n't know whether it was a man or a woman , young or old , white or black . I have n't the faintest idea who I was talking to , but that 's what I was doing . " " Another form of nightmare , " she said . " Can you remember what you were telling this person ? " " Yes , I was telling him about us . About you , and your grandmotherand grandfather . The Van Rhynes , I mean . I told him about Emile . " " Emile who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said.  | " Emile Blanc . What else did you tell him  --  and I notice you say him , so it must have been a man you were talking to . " " I think it probably was a man , but not anyone I know . There 's a possibility that it was someone that never existed , a combination of two people . Paul Vincent and Geraldine St. John . They were the last people I thought of before falling asleep . " " No , we were talking about Rex . " " That 's true , we were . Do you suppose I could have been talking to Rex ? Yes , that 's quite possible . Not our Rex , not our boy as we knew him , but a Rex Kinsmith in his forties . A stranger to you and me . Yes , I could have been telling this Rex Kinsmith all about you and me . Mostly about you . Very little about me . Hardly anything about me . " " It might be a good idea if you got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch television for a while and then go back to bed and you wo n't have the same dream . " " I 'm not sure I do n't want the same dream . But now that I know who I was talking to  --  I think it was this Rex Kinsmith  --  I doubt if I 'll pick up the dream where it left off . Then I did n't know who I was talking to , but now I would know . " " Yes , that would change it . You probably will never have the dream again , now that you 've figured out who it was . " " Oh , I 'm not so sure about that , " he said . " I can very easily imagine going to sleep again and starting right out by thinking of this Rex Kinsmith , and addressing him directly . " " That 's just the opposite of what you said before , " she said . " No , not quite . This time I 'd be starting a new dream , not the old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I was talking to . " " Oh , well now we 're getting into a different thing . Communicationwith the dead . Did this person ever answer you while you were talking to him ? " " No . Never said anything at all , " he said . " I wish you 'd put on your flannel bathrobe and come downstairs and have something to eat . I do n't like this conversation very much . You know I do n't believe in an after-life . This idea that you were talking to Rex after he 'd been dead all these years , but according to your recollection he went on living and is now in his forties . " " I think so , yes , " he said . " Well , you see that 's where I part company with you right away . He was killed when he was twenty-three , and I do n't know anybody that believes you go on growing after you die . Even the most religiousp128people believe that a baby that dies is a baby through all eternity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You have a point , " he said . " Nevertheless I could have created a Rex Kinsmith , like a character in one of my plays , and made him seem so real to my subconscious mind that he becomes a figure that I could talk to . " " Here , put this on , " she said , handing him his bathrobe . " And you 'd better put on some socks or you 'll catch cold . " He held out his hand for the robe , took hold of it , and let it fall on the bedclothes . " I ca n't , Emily , " he said . " I 'll help you . " " You ca n't either . I ca n't move . " " What do you mean , you ca n't move ? " " Just what I say . I think I 'm paralyzed . " " No , Charles . You 're not paralyzed . You were able to pull yourselfup on your pillow . " " Have you got a pin ? Stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I can feel it . " " I do n't have to stick you with a pin . I 'll pinch you . " " All right , " he said . She put her hand under the bedclothes , and held it there . " See ? I did n't feel anything , " he said . " No , because I have n't touched you , " she said . " Well , touch me , " he said . " Are you afraid ? " They looked at each other , eye to eye . " Have you touched me yet ? " he said . " No . " " Then touch me now , please . I have to know , " he said . She took her hand out from under the bedclothes . " What ? " he said . She nodded . " I pinched your calf , I even bent your toe back . " " I am paralyzed ? " he said . " Yes , " she said . " It 's probably temporary , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd better call Jimmy Gray . Call him at home , he 'll be having dinner . And do n't worry . It 's only temporary . One of those pinched-nerve things . " " Of course it is , " she said . " I 'm just glad I did n't break my hip . That 's what happens so often to people our age . That can be real hell , they say . Call Jimmy , and I 'll talk to on Jagger Lane . Could I speak to Dr. Gray , please ? It 's urgent . " " Let me talk to him , " said Charles . She shook her head . " I see . Well , will you please tell him to call me right away ? Mrs. Charles Kinsmith , Amagansett 8-5564 . " She replacedthe telephone . " The answering service . I wonder if I ought to try another doctor . " " No , " he said . " Are you in pain ? " she said . " Not really , " he said . " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my legs . " " Is it all right if I lie on the bed beside you ? " " I wish you would , " he said . " I 'd give you something to stop the pain , but I do n't know what would be the right thing . I do n't want to give you the wrong thing . " " Well , you never have , " he said . She smiled at him . " Have n't I , dear ? " " Never , " he said . " Are you falling asleep ? " " Hmm ? " " I think you 're falling asleep , " she said . He did not answer , and she stared at him . He quivered , shuddered , and expired . She got on the bed and lay beside him . " Take me with you , " she said . " Can you hear me , boy ? Please take me with you ? " Until Jimmy Gray called there was nothing to be done ; no right thing , no wrong thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong things . " Is n't it , Charles ? " she said . " You know it is . You knew it a minute ago . " Now the telephone rang and she reached for it . " Hello ? Yes , is this you , Jimmy ? It 's Charles . He just went down in flames . He was flying like a bird , and he went down in flames . No , you ca n't talk to him . He 's right here , but he 's dead , " she said . She hung up . " I wonder what 's next , " she said . " You know , Charles . What 's next ? "  |p130What  had been four months was now four days , the time left before he would be leaving town for good . " We 'll give you till the first of March to clear out , " the chief of police had said . " You 'll do your thirty days in the sneezer . That should n't be too tough . You 've done that before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can do thirty days standing on one foot , " said Marvin . He tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice ; there was no use irritating the chief . At the same time , he could not resist saying something . Thirty days in the county jail was thirty days and nights of the jail smell , the jail food , the howls of the prisoners having nightmares . " Well , it could of been a lot worse , " said the chief . " It could just as easily been ninety days . " " I know , " said Marvin . " Where do you figure on going next ? " said the chief . " I do n't know . You got any suggestions ? " " One . But you wo n't pay any attention to that , " said the chief . " You mean get a nice , decent , respectable job . " " Tzright , " said the chief . " Doing what ? " Marvin looked at his right shoulder , at his left shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " It do n't have to be , uh , carrying bags of cement . You do n't have to swing a pick and shovel . " " You know the only thing I 'm good for , Chief . " " Yeah , and where does it get you ? Another thirty days up the hill , and I got ta run you out of town . Where do you think you 'll go ? " " South . " " You ever been South ? " said the chief . " You mean those small towns ? Hell , I would n't spend the nightp131in one of them . I was figuring maybe I 'd take a train and go to Miami . 1 'd send the wife and kid on ahead of me in the car . " " This is after you got out of the cooler ? " said the chief . " Yeah , or before , " said Marvin . The chief thought for a few seconds . " We 're going up the hill in about fifteen minutes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that way you 'll get credit for a full day , instead of a half a day . " " Yeah ? " said Marvin . " You do your thirty days , " said the chief . " Yeah ? " " That leaves you three months till the first of March , " said the warden . " You got ta be out of town the first of March . " " Yeah . " " Why do you want to hang around here for , those three months ? The Miami season is just about over then . " " Well , it was my lawyer . Dunphy . The mayor said he 'd give me ninety days on the hill , or if I agreed to leave town when I got out , he 'd reduce it to thirty days . Then Dunphy said I needed more time to find someplace to live , for the wife and kid . " " I did n't understand that , either , " said the chief . " I do n't know why you need three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dice , I 'll throw you in the can again . Does Dunphy want you to do something for him ? " " I do n't know . I honestly do n't know , " said Marvin . " Why would Dunphy want you around ? " " For that matter , why did the mayor give in to Dunphy ? " said Marvin . " Yeah , " said the chief . " I just as soon leave town when I get out , but them two got something cooked up between them . " " The mayor and Dunphy ? " " Uh-huh , " said Marvin . " How about your wife ? Dunphy has a reputation for a ladies ' man . " " Four months gone . You ca n't go near her . " " You 're having another kid , huh ? You getting to be a family man , Marvin ? " " Well , it looks that way . It was n't my idea . Hers , either , I guess . But there you are , you know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief . " Anyway , they want youp132to leave town , but they got it cooked up that you stay three months after you do your thirty days . And Dunphy is n't after your wife . I wonder what 's the mayor 's angle ? " " They both want me to do something , but I do n't know what , " said Marvin . " Yeah , all the signs point to that . Does your wife have enough money while you 're up the hill ? " " We got enough . We got enough if I can go someplace else and start operating . But we do n't have enough to hang around here doing nothing for three months , nothing coming in , all going out . " " Well , we 'll see what happens , " said the chief . " If you 're all ready , I 'll drive you up the hill and turn you over to the warden . " " I 'm ready any time you are , " said Marvin . " You know , you ought n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with brains . The tough guys , I do n't mind locking them up . As far as I 'm concerned , they could throw the key away , when I take some of them up there . But I hate to see a young guy with brains , wasting them . This makes three times they put you away . Twice here , and once in Massachusetts . One of these days it wo n't be a gambling rap , Marvin . They 'll get you on some felony and instead of a month or two , you 'll be in for a year or more . So far you only got misdemeanors against you , but once you get in the felony class , we got ta treat you different . " " I know , " said Marvin . " I got no complaints against you , Chief . " " I 'll say you have n't , " said the chief . " Well , take a good breath of fresh air . Fill your lungs with it . " They got in the chief 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief ride to the county prison . He was checked in by the warden and the turnkey put him in a cell by himself , a luxury that cost him ten dollars . He lay down on the leather straps that would be his mattress for the next twenty-nine days and stared at the ceiling . He caught a cold the second day , and it stayed with him a week . The bedbugs and crabs attacked him the first night and were with him the full time of his imprisonment . His wife came to see him on the four Sunday visiting days , but she did not like the visits and neither did he . He could not tell her to stay away and she could not neglect him . There were no long-term prisoners ; they were sent to state penitentiaries . Consequently the turnover was steady and neither the prisonersnor the turnkeys were inclined to establish a fixed relationship toward each other . The queers among both discovered each other quickly , and had the only unity that existed in the entire prison . Mar/vin got through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was unable to use his solitude for a successful analysis of the motives of Dunphy and the mayor . In every way the thirty days was a waste of time . " How much money we got left ? " he asked his wife on his first day out . " It 's around eight hundred and forty dollars , " she said . " I kept pretty good track . " " Okay . Tomorrow we go to Miami . " " That suits me , " she said . " This town got nothing for me . " " How do you feel ? " " Oh , all right , I guess . I do n't throw up as much . This 'd be a good time to leave town . Then I 'd have three-four months in Miami before the baby , and maybe we could stay there permanent . " " There 's nothing doing there in the summer . I 'd have to come back North . " " Unless you got something steady . " " Not that again , Arleen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start thinking about it . Three times you been arrested  --  " " Ten times I been arrested , but only three times I got locked up . What do I know except gambling ? " " Maybe the next time you get put in jail they 'll keep you there long enough to learn a trade . " " What kind of a remark is that ? I ought to give you a smack in the mouth . " " Just you try it , " she said . " You do n't have the least sense of humor . " " Did I get any mail ? " " Not since Sunday . Oh , Dunphy wants you to phone him . " " I been expecting a letter from Harry Brisbane . Coral Gables . I should of had a letter by this time . " " All you got was a phone call from Dunphy , unless you want to read a letter from my sister . They 're moving to Providence . Everybody'smoving . My mother 's people lived in the same house for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " His stenographer . He 'll be in all afternoon . " He went to see Dunphy . " You put on a little weight , if I 'm not mistaken , " said Dunphy . " What they feed you . Potatoes and bread is all you can eat . "  | " Did n't they give you turkey at Christmas ? " " Yeah , it was the only good meal I had the whole thirty days . Christmas dinner in stir . I 'm getting out of town . " " Yes , I know . " " I mean right away . Not the first of March , " said Marvin . " Will you close that door behind you ? Thanks . Why do you want to get away so fast ? " " I 'm going down to Florida . " " Yes , this is the season . I suppose you have something lined up there ? " " I 'm waiting to hear from a fellow . " " Well , suppose you do n't hear from him ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing here for me . I ca n't operate . You know that . Bradley says if he sees me with a pair of dice in my hand , I go up the hill again . " " That 's just it . He has to see you , first . He has to see you , and he has to be chief of police . And if he is n't chief of police , it does n't make any difference if he sees you . " " Oh . You mean Bradley is on the skids ? " " He may be , " said Dunphy . " Well , say he is . Where does that put me ? " " It could put you at Number 112 East Scandinavia Street . " " The old joint ? You get rid of Bradley and open up again ? " " That seems to be the general idea , " said Dunphy . " How do you get rid of Bradley ? I never heard of him being on the take or anything . " " Not lately , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the take at some time or other . They have to be , to live . " " I never shelled out to him , and he pinched me twice . " " Yes , but we have a new mayor , now , " said Dunphy . " And the son of a bitch sent me up for thirty days . " " What 's thirty days in your young life ? " " Try it , and see , " said Marvin . Dunphy laughed . " Not if I can help it , " he said . " Here is the picture , Marvin . Certain people in town expected the new mayor to adopt a more liberal attitude toward gambling and so forth . But George Daimler is no fool . One of the very first things he did was to send you up the hill , much to the surprise of a lot of people . Probably one of the most surprised people was Tom Bradley . I 'm sure he fully expected that I could persuade the mayor to get you off with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you go up the hill for thirty days . " I was a kind of a fall guy . " " Yes . " " Well , Daimler 's a lot smarter than I gave him credit for , " said Marvin . " Or is it you ? " " Daimler is no fool , but he is n't all that smart . " " It was you , huh ? " " It was I , " said Dunphy . " And that 's who it will be from now on . Were n't you fortunate that you asked me to handle your legal mat-ters ? " " Yes , I guess I was , " said Marvin . " How do you tie a can to Brad-ley ? " " You 'll see , " said Dunphy . " Oh , hell , I might as well tell you . We do n't go back to when he was pounding a beat and taking a few bananas off the fruit stand . We had to have something more recent than that . " " Yeah , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Dodge sedan . It 's registered in his name , and he 's the legal owner . But in the two years he 's had it , I doubt if he ever bought a single gallon of gas for it . The dealer put two new sets of tires on it and billed the city . Twice it was overhauled at city expense , and he brings it in for a washing once a week . If we wanted to , we could easily prove that he had the tank filled several times before taking outof-towntrips . It adds up to quite a sum . Sheer carelessness on his part . We 're going to let him resign , and be eligible for his pension . If he makes a stink , we 'll make a stink . He could go to jail . " " Boy ! " " Well , do you still want to go to Miami ? " said Dunphy . " You 're kidding , " said Marvin . " When do we open up ? " " Shortly . Very shortly , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old part of town , in a section that had ceased to be fashionable but that at one time had been not just one but the only neighborhood for the very rich to live in . It was two blocks long , this section , on both sides of the street . There was no uniformity to the design of the houses , and yet they all looked the same because they were all built of brick or brownstone and presented a solid , substantial front of planned severity . The houses of plastercoveredbrick were even more forbidding than the houses built of cut stone . Stone , being stone , retained the marks of its ancient porosity and therefore had that much more life than the bland , grey-brown artificiality of the plaster . Not until the rich began to desert the neighborhoodand the plaster cracks were neglected did any of the houses begin to look human . Thereafter the houses and the people in them commenced to look very human indeed . The residential character of the neighborhood changed completely between 1915 and 1920 . Nearly every house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty parlor , a tire shop , a bakery , a grocery store , a motorcycle-bicycle agency , two automobile showrooms , an army and navy surplus outfit , a paperhanger-painter 's establishment , a shoe repair and hat cleaning establishment , an electrical supply store with a crazy assortment of lighting fixtures hanging like stalactites from the ceiling . The upstairs rooms were used for storage , for the offices of painless dentists , and for apartments . By the time Mr. Coolidgewas inaugurated President , the only house in the neighborhood that was strictly a private residence was Number 444 , the home of General Dixon L. Hightower and his wife . It surprised no one that they went on living there . It would have amazed their friends if the Hightowers had moved.  |p137The  feeling that the Hightowers belonged in 444 was not so much due to the fact that Sophronia Hightower had been born in that house as to the widely held belief , among the young and uninformed , that it was General Hightower 's lifetime residence . Actually the Stokes family had built 444 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie Stokes . Thereafter , however , he never left it for any considerable length of time except for his army service duringthe Spanish-American War , and the annual encampments of the National Guard at Mount Gretna . The coal millionaires of the neighborhoodguarded their privacy and the comparative anonymity of their houses , but 444 was the home of the town 's only general and in many ways he gave it its character . A workingman who lived to the south of Number 444 would often explain that he came from " down past General Hightower 's , " and people would know what section of town he lived in . There was not much town left beyond General Hightower'shouse . Tourists passing through the town without leaving Main Street would get the impression that there was only one really nice house in the community . Unquestionably , in the post-war years Number 444 and the Hightowers belonged together to a degree that house and owner too rarely achieve . Dick Hightower , the general , had added a few touches of his own to the original boxlike structure : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crenelated cornice , a stone heraldic eagle clutching arrows over the front door . It was a corner property and the Hightowers had a side yard as well as a back yard , which were protected from trespassers by an iron fence consistingof simulated spears . In the geometric center of the side yard was , of course , a flagstaff topped by a screaming gilt eagle . Every five years or so someone would reinvent the name Fort Hightower for the place , but it never caught on . The joke was always short-lived because in the milder seasons Sophie Hightower was to be seen in the yard , tending her rose bushes and peonies and entertaining her friends in the summerhouse in the back yard . Dixon Hightower was a military man , fully qualified by Regular Army experience until he resigned his commission to marry Sophronia Stokes , and entitled to his brigadier 's star by virtue of his subsequent promotions in the National Guard of Pennsylvania . At West Point he had remained in the bottom half of his class and therefore upon graduationwas assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been under fire in the Indian Territory and had spent ten years at army posts . He knew the difference between a buttonstickand a Gatling gun , although the young and uninformed werep138inclined to be skeptical of their elders ' somewhat vague assurances that the general had once been a warrior . He had five or six medals that he wore to military funerals of former officers of the Guard . The younger crowd , those who were reaching maturity after the 1918 Armistice , had stopped calling him a toy soldier , but they did not seriouslybelieve that he could ever have been in battle . In his blues , wearing his medals and his sword , he would go to funerals and review the local militia , but when the troops went off to the Mexican border in 1916 , he marched with them only as far as the railroad station , remounted his horse and rode back to Fort Hightower . It was the same in 1917 , when the Guard and the conscripts went away to war , with the difference that now he no longer wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders of the community who were membersof the Patriotic League , and instead of a sword he carried a malaccastick . He was past the age when he could be useful except as a member of the draft board , and he was not even in command of that . " If I 'd stayed in the army , " he said to Sophie , " I 'd have my own division . " " Well , are you sorry you did n't stay in ? " she said . " Oh , please do n't misunderstand me , " he said , " You know I 've never regretted that decision . You must know , Sophie . Do n't you ? " " Well , that 's what I 've always thought , " she said . " What I meant , all I meant was that there are men my age , or just a few classes behind me , that are divisional commanders today . Joe Westman has a division . Ted Maguire is a major general on Pershing'sstaff . And other fellows I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars . Lieutenant generals , they are . Peyton March , and Jack Pershing , not much younger than I , with four stars . My goodness , but the time flies . But I suppose I 'm well out of it . I was never very good at army politics , and now I hear that there 's no love lost between March and Pershing , and Leonard Wood and Pershing have had a tussle . " " You told me before we were married that you were n't very tact-ful . " " Well , you 've found that out for yourself , " he said . " Yes , I have . But I was thinking of army politics . I wonder how I 'd have been as an army wife . " " You 'd have managed , for a while , " he said . " But if I know you , my girl , some captain 's wife would go just a little too far and you 'd give her a piece of your mind . As my old friend Sam Bannister used top139say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army wife does n't have to . " " No , I do n't think I 'd have made a very good army wife , " said Sophie . " Mind you , you 'd have gotten through it if you 'd had to . I am not saying that , Sophie . But I never could have asked you to put up with the discomforts and inconveniences . Not to mention the snubs and the discipline . That kind of a life would have broken your spirit . " " Oh , do you think so ? " " Might have . It very nearly did mine , and I was used to it . It 's a very contradictory thing , army life . I remember having a long talk with a British officer I got to know in Washington . He was a career man , then about forty , and a major . I was a good deal younger , but we hit it off well together , and used to see a lot of each other . Charles Willing-Lloyd , hyphenated . Have n't thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , with the name Lloyd . " " You had a long talk with him ? " " Many . But one I remember particularly . I 'd just come up from Brownsville and he and I were comparing notes . The rigors of army life and so on . He 'd been in Africa and India and all over , and he was a very interesting conversationalist . There was a small group of us that used to meet for dinner once a month . Army and navy officers , attaches , and we 'd play cards for not very high stakes , or some of us would just sit and chat . One evening Charles and I were comparing notes , and he made to me what was a very profound observation . He 'd been in action , mentioned in dispatches and so on , but he insisted that it takes a different sort of man to be a good career officer . A war , he said , does n't demand as much of a man as the day-to-day army routine . When the bugles sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ready to die , ready to shed their blood , it 's true . But they 're amateurs . And they will die and they will shed their blood needlessly if we have n't done our jobs between wars . That fact is never understood by the civilian mind . All they see of us in peacetime is parades , gold braid , unloaded weaponry . Military funerals , military balls , the governor 's inauguration . And a few weeks of camp in the summer in neat rows of tents with canvas flies over them and flooring underneath . But we 've been living under discipline and our men have been too . So that when the amateurs get into it , the professionals can show them that orders are there to be obeyed . " " You wrote me all this in a letter one time , " said Sophie.  | " Did I ? Well , that does n't surprise me , " he said . " I was very full of it at the time , when I was hesitating about whether to resign my commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sophie . " Oh , Sophie , he did no such thing ! " " I know he did n't , Dickie . I 'm only joking . " " But you must n't joke about such things , " he said . " There 've only been two things in my life I 've ever cared deeply for . Our marriage , and the army . And I 'd never joke about our marriage . I wish I could feel as deeply about religion , especially now that we 're both getting on in years . " " You 've always been a good Christian , dear . I do n't think the good Lord above will punish you for your doubts . We all have them . " " Not you , " he said . " Every year in June , when you take such pride in your roses , all your doubts disappear . You always say the same thing . There has to be a God to create such beauty . " " I have n't said that in years , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's what you feel . " " There are many times when you have n't the slightest notion what I feel . " " So you say . But that 's what you 'd like me to think . You 're a woman and you like to be mysterious . Perfectly all right , of course . No harm done , as long as it does n't get out of hand . It 's like my saying that I could have my own division . Yes , I 'd have my own division , if . And you 'd be very mysterious , if . " " If what ? " " If I 'd stayed in the army , " he said . " No , I meant , I 'd be very mysterious if what ? " said Sophie . " Well , if you 'd been an altogether different kind of a person . And if you 'd been an altogether different kind of person I assure you I 'd never have resigned my commission to marry you . What 's more , if I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission , you never would have married me . If , if , if . My goodness , but we waste our time with our ifs . Have n't we got something better to do than that ? " " Well , I have , thank heavens , " she said . She rose , put on her wide-brimmed Panama , and picked up her gardening pouch . The Panama had once been his , the pouch was an old musette bag . " Mysterious ? You and I mysterious ? " he said . " I did n't say you were , " she said . He smiled and went to his desk , where there were always a greatp141many letters to be answered . She had her flowers , he had his correspondence . Four times during the winter months they asked friends in for dinner . Once there had been little jokes about the neighborhood to tease the dinner guests who had moved to the west end of town . " Welcomeback to The Bowery , " Dixon Hightower would say , but the jokes wore a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never liked jokes of any kind , put a stop to them . " Since you bring up the subject , Dick Hightower , " said Mrs. McMasters . " I do n't see why you stay down here . It may be all right for you , but it 's no place for Sophie . " " Why not ? She 's in her old homestead . " " I was in my old homestead , too , but I had sense enough to get out . The smoke from the locomotives  --  you do n't know what it is to keep things clean , let alone breathe decent air . " " Get rid of your Reading Company stock , " said Hightower . " I will not get rid of my Reading Company stock . I did n't say the smoke was n't necessary , but I had sense enough to get out of the thick of it . I own stock in the steel mill , too , but I do n't have to listen to the noise . This is no place for Sophie to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " " Then I 'll see that she does n't . She never has , but I promise not to let her start any bad habits . " " Bad habits ? " said Mrs. McMasters . " Such as walking the streets at night , " said Hightower . " Dixon Hightower , sometimes you go too far with your attempts to be humorous . I prefer to talk about something else , if you do n't mind . " The mortality rate among their friends reduced the Hightowers ' social obligations . The death of Elsie McMasters not only struck her from their list but made it inconvenient for George and Laura Cromer , who had been dependent on Elsie and her gigantic Locomobilelimousine , to get to Number 444 . The Cromers had to watch every penny , and taxicabs were out of the question . The Hood McGowenscould afford taxis , but when Minnie McGowen discovered a naughty word scratched in the varnish of their Pierce-Arrow outside the Hightowers ' house , she resolved that they had paid their final visit to the neighborhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was keeping warm in the Hightower kitchen . She was somewhat inclined to blame Dick Hightower for his stubbornness in remaining in that section of town . Daniel Wynkoop , their bachelorp142friend , showed up on the wrong night , twenty-four hours early , and took pot-luck with Dick and Sophie . Unfortunately he finished off most of a bottle of pre-Prohibition rye before going home , and was beaten and robbed of $25 and a gold watch less than a block away from the Hightowers ' . He was unable to give the police an accurate description of his assailants . The Hightowers ' surviving friends went on inviting them to their houses , but the balance of social exchange was too one-sided . More and more people were finding excuses not to accept invitations to 444 , and even in the dinner season there would be periods two months long in which Dick and Sophie dined alone . Those evenings were not unpleasant for him ; he had more time for his correspondence , and the World War had produced a whole new libraryof military histories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed war with a jaundiced eye . Dick Hightower disliked the novels and some of the histories , but it amused him to find so many authors who were discovering for the first time an obvious truth that Sherman had stated profanely nearly seventy years before them . His correspondence  --  at least his part of it  --  expanded as a result of his reading of the new books . He was in fact quite busy . Sophie , however , was not much of a reader . She read the local paper in the evening and the Philadelphia Public Ledger in the morning ; the Delineator , The Ladies ' Home Journal and Life . If a friend strongly recommended a novel by Booth Tarkington , Edna Ferber , or John Galsworthy she would read it , and get all through it no matter how long it took . She had a Philadelphia friend who was related to Joseph Hergesheimer , and that was Sophie 's nearest connection with a living author . In their evenings at home after dinner she sometimes envied Dick and his absorption in his books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written and triumphantly read it to her . He would exclaim , " Bully ! " when he came upon a telling passage in a book , but he would often have to read back over ten or twenty pages of a military campaign to explain why a single line had met with his enthusiastic approval . It was seldom worth it ; Ludendorff 's right flank was too hard to follow . " I know it does n't mean the way it sounds to me , " she said . " But when any general exposes his right flank , you can imagine what I think . " " Not Ludendorff , though . He was never caught with his pants down . " " Then why do n't they find some other way of saying it ? " she said . After dinner they would have coffee and a thimbleful of a liqueurp143from their dwindling stock . He was perfectly willing to let her have his share of such things as Benedictine , but the tiny drink was more ceremonialthan gustatorial and they agreed that it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their supply was gone . Already they had begun to substitute applejack for their good gin and whiskey in cocktails when guests were not present . Applejack , they had discovered , made an acceptable " whiskey sour , " if you limited yourself to two . They had not yet found it necessary to patronize a town bootlegger . When that time came , Dick was going to have to wrestle with his conscience . " Everybody breaks the law , and it 's a law that I 'm opposed to , " he said . " However , I 'm not going to feel right about it . I do n't like the thought of having some bootlegger say he has General Hightower for a customer . Then there 'd be the question of delivering it here . I would n't like that at all , and I 'm most certainly not going to their place and bring it home with me . I do n't keep any at the club , so when someone offers me a cocktail , I just say no , because I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club it might be a differentmatter , but they have a lot of lawyers from out of town come there for lunch . As long as people call me General I do n't think I ought to flout the law of the land . Do you , Sophie ? Am I being inconsistent , or hypocritical ? " " Not you , Dick . The law is hypocritical . " " No , I would n't say that . It was a constitutional amendment , had to be approved by two thirds of the states , and the law itself is n't hypocritical . Very well meaning . But it does n't work . The people have tried it , and they do n't want it , and those that do want it should step out of the way . Take defeat gracefully . I 'll vote in favor of repeal of the law and I know I will . Therefore I think I 'm being consistent . But I 'd hate to think I was being hypocritical about it , drinking at home and not at the club . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You think I 'm being inconsistent because I wo n't deal with the bootleggers ? " " Well , I just thought of it . " " Schertzinger , the farmer , delivers it . He leaves it in the stable , in one of the old box stalls . I leave the cash in an envelope , behind that picture of Dan Patch . A gallon every two weeks . " " Do we drink that much ? " " Just about . Four ounces apiece , every day . That 's twenty-eight ounces a week . In four weeks we dispose of 112 ounces , or seven quarts . There are four quarts in a gallon . We never run out of it ,  |p144because  we keep that much ahead of our supply . But I do n't consider Adam Schertzinger in the same category with those bootleggers . We 've always bought our sweet cider from him and his father , since time immemorial . Nearly all our vegetables . Your mother dealt with the Schertzinger family when you were a little girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know . Did n't I help them get one of their sons into West Point ? Or at least I tried . If he could have overcome that PennsylvaniaDutch accent they 'd have taken him . " " He turned out all right , " said Sophie . " Actually much better than if he 'd tried to be an army officer . The accent is no handicap to a country doctor , but it would have been at The Point . They 're used to southern accents , but they 'd have laughed at young Schertzinger . Just imagine how they 'd ridicule him . It rains a lot at West Point , and they would n't know what he was talking about when he said , It makes down uckly . ' " " And The pie is all . ' " " Hmm . He would n't have much occasion to say that . We saw damn little pie when I was there . Mince pie at Christmas , my plebe year . " Their conversations had a way of drifting toward army life no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been otherwise with Dick Hightower . Other husbands , Sophie had found , did the same thing in conversation with their wives . Doctors digressed to medicine , lawyers to law , bankers to finance . Unlike other husbands , Dick Hightowerwas a chatterbox , and though his topics might be sandwiched between one army reminiscence and another , he did hold forth on other things . In fact  --  and she said this about once a year  --  if other people could know Dick Hightower as she knew him , they would realize that he was one of the most fascinating men you could ever hope to meet . In his youth he had traveled a great deal throughout the United States and territories , he had acquired a knowledge of history and could read French and German without much difficulty , he read the New York and Philadelphia papers at the club every day , he subscribedto magazines like The Literary Digest , the Review of Reviews , the Army &; Navy Journal , the National Geographic , and Foreign Affairs . She did not see where he got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them and did so . Once a year , on Memorial Day , he would give the principal address at the ceremonies at the Soldiers &; Sailors Monument , and he would begin the preparation of this speech right after the Christmas holidays . It was such a thorough , painstakingp145piece of work that both newspapers printed the speech in toto , from the copies given them in advance . This was in the nature of a precautionagainst being misquoted and for the purpose of providing the full text to history students in the public and Catholic high schools . The General Dixon L. Hightower Prize of ten dollars cash and a certificate suitable for framing was awarded annually to the student in each high school who had the best marks in American history . Dick 's attendanceat the commencement exercises was only one source of the kind of pleasurable experience that animated his conversations with Sophie . ( " A little Italian girl won the prize at the Catholic school . Her father and mother can barely speak English . " ) But his interests were not all on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the post office with ever so many things to tell her , little things that he had noticed that would escape the attention of a less observant man . Every morning , Monday through Friday , he would leave the house at ten o'clock , beautifully dressed in fine weather , with one of his walking sticks and bowler , Homburg , or Panama ; grey spats and never the same suit two days running . On cold days he had his fur-lined black broadcloth or his long tweed ulster , and on rainy days inevitably his trench coat . He was so punctual that the motormen on the trolley lines had their own little custom of salutinghim with taps on the floor bell , which he would acknowledge with a semi-military wave of the hand . As there were ten-o'clock trolleys for several out-of-town points the general 's progress northward to the center of town was , as he said , tintinnabulated . ( " You knew that EdgarAllan Poe went to West Point , briefly . " ) His first stop was Joseph Ostertag 's cigar store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco , and snuff . He had never sold a cigarette or a box of candy , and he stocked only Piper Heidsieck chewing tobacco for a few special customers ( two county judges and a few Catholic priests ) . Back of his store , invisible from it , was his small cigar factory , in which three men and an apprentice were kept busy hand-rolling the two grades of Ostertag cigars : the twenty-five-cent straight Perfecto , and the two-for-a-quarter Special . Joseph was a dour man who owned the building in which he sold and made his cigars , the adjoining building , which contained a shoe store and three stories of offices , and a large storage warehouse in the North End of town . There were men in a position to know who said they would like to have what Joe Ostertag had over a million dollars . Nevertheless he was his own store clerk and did his own sweeping and cleaning . In his store he had a single bentwood chair , not for sociability but becausep146one of his steady customers had once had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one  --  wife , friend , or customer  --  was permitted to call him Joe . Dick Hightower had been a regular customer of Joseph Ostertag'sfor twenty years , but their opening exchange had not changed . " Good morning , Joseph . " " Good morning to you , sir . " " Two Perfectos , please . " Ostertag would raise the lid of the box and allow Dick Hightowerto choose , although the cigars were individually foil-wrapped . " Will you put that on my account , please ? " Ostertag would write in a ledger . " Two . . . Per . . . fec ... toes ... D ... L ... High ... tower ... 4  --   --   --  4  --   --   --  4  --   --   --  South . . . Main . " It was not necessary to record the price ; it had not changed either . As for the quality of the leaf , it had if anything got better , but that was a matter not to be discussed wih Ostertag . That was his business . In recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their transaction , permitted themselves some additionalconversation . It usually concerned the stock market , which , since it was not the cigar business , was not a closed topic . Ostertag , surprisingly enough , traded on margins . But he made up for this **25;7189;TOOLONG practice by getting out of a stock the moment it showed a three-point rise . Weeks would go by in which he did not trade at all , then one of the five stocks in which he specialized would be offered at an attractive price and he would again buy for the threepointprofit . Hightower , using Ostertag 's information , would stay in for a fivepointrise , but he never bought on margin , and his profits were smaller . He was content with small profits . His speculation was satisfactoryif it made him pocket money , two to three thousand dollars a year . Sophie 's fortune was administered by a Philadelphia trust companyand he never interfered . She gave him $6,000 a year , paid all the household bills and reinvested the surplus income of her trust funds . The surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be his in the event of her death . The trust funds were not hers to dispose of , but he would never require more than the income from $100,000 . And as she pointed out , the $ioo , 000 rightfully belonged to him , inasmuch as she would have given him $7500 a year or $io , 000 a year if he had wanted it . But he did not want it . He wanted no more than he had , no difference in the scale of their living , no change in his way of life that would take the fun out of careful spending . He did not wishp147to wear ready-made clothes , but he made his tailor-made suits and handmade shoes last , so that the arrival of a new suit or a pair of Oxfords was an event , not merely a purchase . " The small pleasures , " he would say . The motormen 's salute . The conversations with Joseph Ostertag . The reasonable profits in the stock market . The **30;7216;TOOLONG . From Ostertag 's he would go to the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , if the New York papers had made the train connections . If not , he would buy a Philadelphia North American because there was nothing else he cared to buy , and he had to buy something . He would exchange greetings with the station agent , the baggagemaster , and the telegraph operator , and return to Main Street . The traffic policeman operating the semaphore would salute him , and he would raise his hand in a return salute that was a trifle more military than the gesture he accorded the trolley motormen . The policeman , after all , bore arms , and Dick Hightower happened to know he was a former member of the National Guard . For the next hour or so he would occupy a chair in the board room of the local branch of Westmore &; Company , stock brokers . He would leave his overcoat on a hanger but keep his hat on or in his lap . All the customers kept their hats on unless they were seated next to one of the women customers . ( Their patronage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . ) Dick Hightower 's hour in the Westmore board room was a high point of his day . He would trim the first of his two Ostertag Perfectoes with his gold cutter , and take his place in the front row of chairs . All the customers knew each other , and they felt free to make running comments as the board boys chalked up the quotations coming in on the stock ticker . The regular customers , the daily visitors , were not only acquainted with each other but they also knew which men were trading in which securities . It was a motley crowd of retired business men , merchants , bootleggers , insurance salesmen , lawyers , two old maids and a madam . It was not considered good form for a bank employe to be seen in the board room , a restriction that did not apply to bank directors . Notwithstandingthe presence of the women , the board room atmosphere was that of a sporting event , an uninterrupted race meeting five hours long . The chairs were comfortable , the temperature was kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a customers ' toilet with two urinals . Dick Hightower was a light trader , whose commissions covered only his share of the firm 's overhead , but he added tone to the place and Westmore &; Company knew it and hep148knew it . No other firm in town could claim the simultaneous patronageof the general and the madam , and his manner of saying " Good morning , " to her , without ever uttering her name , was precisely correctand an example which the other men followed . One word from him and the firm would have discouraged the madam 's visits ; but he did not speak that word , and the firm was tacitly grateful for his tolerance . " You see that woman every day ? " Sophie once said . " Every single day , " said Dick Hightower . " What do you say to her ? " said Sophie . " I say good morning . " " You speak to her ? How did you ever get to know her ? " " We were never formally introduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , she knows some of the men . " " Do the other women speak to her ? " " Do the other women speak to her ? No , I do n't believe they do . They never sit with her , I know that . " " She just talks to the men ? " " Well , she 's rather used to that , " he said . " What if you had to sit next to her ? What would you say to her ? " " It 's very doubtful that I 'd ever find myself in that predicament . After all , I know how to maneuver myself . " " What if she maneuvered herself next to you ? " " That will never happen . If you did n't know who she was , you 'd never take her for a prostitute . She 's quite ugly . She wears a sealskin coat , but no jewelry except a wedding ring . " " A wedding ring ? " " Most of them do , " he said . " Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were often entertained by them . Every good-sized town has at least one madam that young officers know about . " " You never told me that . Did you patronize them ? " " I did . " " Oh , Dick , you did n't . " " Sorry to disillusion you , but I did . " " I suppose I knew that , really . " " You could have found out any time you asked me . Remember , I was past thirty when I met you . "  | " So was I. " He smiled . " I 'd never have known if you had n't told me . " " That was about all I had to tell , " she said . " Think of the differencebetween that woman and me . I mean in what she knows about life . " " Life ? Whatever she knows about life , it has n't done her much good . If you could see her you 'd understand that . It 's all written in her face . Women of your sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're tarnished , all right , but very few of them were ever beauties . You know the expression , as ugly as sin . " " Then why would a nice young man want to have anything to do with them ? " " Because nice young women have to stay nice or they are n't nice any more , if I make myself clear . " " Perfectly , " she said . Unless there were unusually active trading in the market , Dick left Westmore &; Company before noon , to be a little ahead of the midday rush at the post office . He had a large mailbox to receive his books and periodicals . He would open it with his key and take out what he wanted and leave the rest for a dull day . He did not wish to be overburdened on his walk to the club , in the course of which he often had to stop and chat with ladies ; and while he could manage his cane and a book or two and the removal of his hat , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in uniform . Early habits were hard to break . Later habits were easily formed . At the club he would go to the cloakroom and put away his things , wash his hands as in a ceremonial ablution that symbolized his withdrawal from the contacts of commerce and common folk , and his return to the world of the gentleman . Not all the members of the club met his standards , but every gentleman in town was a member of the club . He would rub his soap-softened hands and enter the billiard room , where even at half past eleven in the morning at least one game would be in progress . " I 'm up , " he would say , and write his initials on a blackboardto signify his intention of challenging the first winner . A wooden plaque , listing the club billiards champions of other years , had D. L. Hightower as champion for 1911 and 1912 and runner-up in 1913 , 1914 , and 1917 . He would never reign again ; the younger men were too good for him ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could still run out a string of twenty-one points . He was a slow player , which gave him a psychological advantage over the younger men , and he would play more slowly than usual against thosep150who showed impatience . This strategy delighted his contemporaries , the members of the Old Guard who occupied the same luncheon table every day . " Dick , you old fox , you had young Choate half out of his mind , " they would say . " Do n't call me an old fox . Call me an old tortoise , " he would say . " The race is not always to the swift . " He managed to win enough money to cover his house charges . The seventy-five-cent table d'hote came to six dollars a week , and he had usually won that amount by the Wednesday . In weeks that he had fallen behind he could count on making a comeback on the Saturday , when he could play all afternoon until he made six dollars . The players were more apt to imbibe on Saturdays . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch on weekdays , but there was likely to be some activity in the card room . Dick Hightower tried to stay out of the post-luncheon auction bridge . He had found that his contemporaries got sleepy after the meal , especiallyon Monday , Wednesday , and Friday when the club specialty , deep-dish apple pie , was on the menu . The stakes were never high , but it was no fun to see one 's partner 's eyelids begin to droop , to hear the heavy , regular breathing that portended a nap at the table . " Whitfield is in the land of Nod , " someone would say . " Shall we leave him there ? " " What ? What ? Is it my lead ? " the sleepy one would say . " Not quite . Your partner just said two no trump , and I passed . " " Two no trump ? Let 's see now , can we review the bidding ? " " All right . I opened with a heart , you said a spade , my partner raised my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I passed . " " And you were the original heart bidder , eh ? Oh , yes , now it 's coming back to me . I 'll have to say three spades . " " And you do say three spades ? " " Yes . Three spades . I said , three spades . Oh , wait just a second . Two no trump would have given us game . However , I said three spades and three spades it is . Yes , three spades . " Yet even on days when the deep-dish apple pie was not having a toxic effect Dick Hightower would have preferred to be elsewhere . The club notepaper , of stiff stock and nicely embossed , was just right for certain items of his correspondence . At the writing desks , moreover , were sticks of sealing-wax and birthday-cake candles , and envelopesbearing the imprint of Dick 's signet ring went out almost daily to sick friends , the lately bereaved , classmates who had achieved hon/ors or grandparenthood , recent hostesses , and the beneficiaries of his spontaneous acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give his home address . Foremost among these were non-commissioned officers and their families whom he would read about in the newspapers , men whom he had never known and who frequently were residents of distantcommunities , who had met with misfortune that a five-dollar bill , a ten-dollar bill , might help to alleviate . These gifts , and the acknowledgmentsof them , were a secret from Sophie and from everyone else . They never amounted to $ i oo a year , and on several occasions they had invited requests for larger donations , but he refused to be disillusionedby the greedy or the suspicious . Over the years the practice gave him much satisfaction . " You know , General , a lot of people must think you live here , " said Walter Beers , the paid secretary . " You get more mail than the club , outside of bills . " " Well , I do live here , about a quarter of my waking hours , Walter , " said Dick Hightower . " Yes , I guess that 's right , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your meals here , leaving out Sunday . " " That 's correct , and I get most of my exercise here . " Beers laughed . " Exercise ? Here ? " " At the billiard table . Someone , I believe , calculated that an hour at the billiard table is the equivalent of a three-mile walk . I have my doubts , but we must find out if one of the members has a pedometer . You do n't happen to know of any ? " " To be truthful , General , I do n't know what one is . A what did you call it ? " " A pedometer . Measures how far you walk . " " What do you do , attach it to your foot ? I never heard of one . " " You attach them to your belt , but between us I do n't consider them very reliable . " " I would n't , either . I do n't trust the one I got on my car . " " Is that so ? Walter , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon ? " " I 'll drop them by the post office on my way home . " An incredibly dull man , Walter Beers , but he had come home with a wound chevron from Chateau-Thierry , and Dick Hightower first had known him as company clerk and bugler in old Company B. A dull , unmilitary man , who nevertheless had battle stars on his VictoryMedal and a fourragere on his now tight-fitting uniform . Hep152would be club secretary as long as Dick Hightower had anything to say about it . " Walter , can you still sound pay-call ? " Walter laughed . " You mean on the bugle , General ? Now what ever made you think of that ? My goodness . Pay-call . I ca n't even remember how it went , let alone play it . I got my youngest boy , he 's a second-class Scout , and they decided to make him a bugler on account of me . But they do n't have pay-call in the Scouts . One less he has to learn than me . The neighbors ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General . I was n't a bugler overseas . We just used the whistle over there , but I still got the same original old horn I had in B-Com-pany . " " Hold on to it , Walter . It 's government property , but I think you 're entitled to it . " " They 'd have a hard time getting it away from me , " said Walter . Four-thirty or five , time to return to 444 , and timed carefully . The outpouring of the children from the schools was over , the departureof people who worked in shops and offices had not yet begun . At home there was tea ( after a careful scrubbing of his hands ) . Because it was still daylight , Sophie would often have a visitor or two , and Dick was always the only male present . He would be at his courtly best ; the head of the house , the host , the man in women 's territory like a boy visiting his sister 's boarding-school . All that , and The General , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his thin grey hair smoothed down , his necktie in place , the smudges on his shoes rubbed away . There would be a mechanical , innocuous flirtatiousnessin his manner , put there as soon as he entered the sitting room , so that Sophie 's guests would envy her her life with him . " Have n't you ladies got any gossip for me ? There 's nothing new at the club , I can assure you , " he would say . Although they might have been exchanging information on the town 's latest scandal , they offered none of it to him . He would not have welcomed it if they had . But the pretense of curiosity added a sparkle to the ritual of tea . Any real gossip Sophie had picked up would be duly passed on to him when they were alone , in language of the utmost purity but with illustrative gestures , and as completely descriptiveas a police report . He had never asked her how her women friends were able to communicate details without using the language of the gutter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were ignorant of medical terminology . Nevertheless Sophie and her friends made their stories graphically real , and therep153was nothing in the calendar of sin that she had not at some time been able to convey to him in the telling of an episode . A day or two later  --  or a day or two earlier  --  the same story would be told at the club without the language restraints , but the women left nothing out . Sophie was an accomplished gossip , a talent that compensated for her inability to concentrate on the printed word . As she was childlessshe was not compelled to protect her own son and daughter from reprisals . As she was beyond reproach in her conduct , she was invulnerableto gossip about herself . And as her husband led a blameless life , she had nothing to fear from misconduct on his part . Not even her chambermaid could find any evidence of the methods by which they took pleasure in each other , and it was assumed that if there had ever been erotic excitement in their marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of their marriage , when Dick was a newcomer to the town , the obvious comment had been made that Sophie was a fortunate young woman to have captured such a handsome young man . She herself was plain , and though a good-sized fortune went with her , the eligible young men of the town had failed to be attracted by it . It was not unusual for a young army officer to marry for money , but when Sophie 's husband resigned his commission and took up residenceat 444 , with no apparent inclination to enter the world of business , he came in for some harsh , if guarded , criticism as a fortune hunter . The criticism was not entirely fair . Investigation revealed that Dixon Hightower was not a nobody . The Hightower family were old Chester County stock who had scattered over the southeastern section of the Commonwealth , and who numbered among their living membersa college president , several clergymen , some successful farmers , and a Philadelphia banker . Sophie 's bridegroom was the only son of a weekly newspaper publisher and job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia banker . William Hightower 's business brought in little cash , but he accepted goods and services in lieu of it , and he always had a roof over his head and enough to eat . He was a graduate of a Friends Seminary , and had hoped to send his son to the new college at Swarthmore , but the opportunity to educate the boy at government expense was not to be denied . The rich cousin in Philadelphiaoffered no financial assistance , and as William Hightower had not been raised a Quaker , the cousin 's scruples against a West Point education were considered to be all foam and no beer . Dixon Hightower 's army experience , beginning with West Point ,  |p154taught  him frugality and at the same time helped him acquire expensivetastes . The frugality was , of course , a refinement of the manner in which he had been brought up at home ; the expensive tastes were new , but he took to them readily . Throughout his army career he needed financial assistance from his parents . As an army officer his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be paid for , and he could not safely rely on his carefully hoarded winnings at cards for the expenses of the mess and visits to the cities . His father therefore practiced small economies ; he smoked a cheap grade of Lancaster County tobacco , wore homemade carpet slippers in his shop and at home . His mother competed with her neighbors in fancywork and dressmaking . Together they were able to contribute as much as $500 a year to the maintenance of their son 's standards , and it was worth it to them when he came home on leave , dressed in his blues and bringingthem presents that they had paid for . He would be invited to hunt the fox with the nearby gentry and he was popular with its younger members . Their parents , however , knew to the penny what Dixon Hightower 's financial expectations must be , and they were vigilant in keeping him at an unromantic distance from their daughters . It did not matter to them when Sophie Stokes , daughter of an upstate coal fortune , determinedly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mothers were all in favor of a union that would get Sophie a husband and young Hightower safely married . Dixon was well behaved , but not all the young wives were completely happy with their husbands . Sophie Stokes was already courtesy aunt to the children of her friends , a readily available companion to the young wives during their confinements . She had acquired all the essential information about the young army officer , and knew from her friends that his mother earned pin-money by such work as letting out dresses for the expectant young matrons . She paid a visit to his father 's newspaper-printing shop and saw him in his carpet slippers . As a Stokes she was a realist , a member of a family that demanded good value and had been remarkably successful in getting it . There was no doubt in her mind that Dixon Hightower represented good value for her , but he had never visited her part of the Commonwealth and could not be expected to know that she might also represent good value for him . He had been polite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indicated an attraction . He still called her Miss Stokes . Toward the end of his leave , before returning to his army dutiesp155at Fort Niagara , he was seated next to her at a dinner party , and this , she knew , might be her last chance . " Where is Fort Niagara ? " she said . " I suppose it 's somewhere near Niagara Falls . " " Quite near . It 's on Lake Ontario . They call it the Niagara Frontier . It 's a very pleasant place to be after the heat of Texas . " " And the city of Buffalo is somewhere near , is it not ? " she said . " I have friends in Buffalo . The Watsons . " " I 've been to their house . Colonel Watson , on Delaware Avenue ? Is that the same one ? " " He made his money in railroads . It 's the same one . I went to school with his daughter Jessica . Now Mrs. John Fisher . " " Yes , I know Jessica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So I 'm told , " she said . " Is that the sort of life you care for ? The entertaining on the grand scale ? " " Yes , I confess I do . " " But you ca n't do much of it on army pay . " " No , and if I were married I could n't do it at all . " " Unless you had a rich wife , " she said . " Why have n't you got a rich wife ? " He smiled . " Because no rich young lady has ever proposed to me . " " Very well . I do . " " Be careful , I might accept , " he said . " If you knew me better you 'd know that I want you to accept . " " Here ? Now ? " " Yes , " she said . " Assuming for the moment that you 're not pulling my leg , I could n't accept . Right now , I 'm in debt , in no position to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little over eight hundred dollars . " " I have it in my purse , upstairs . You may consider it yours . " " It 's very unwise to carry that much cash about with you , " he said . " Why do you ? " " Because I like to . And if I 'm robbed , I have more . Do you know who my father was ? The name Stokes does n't mean anything to you people down here , but I assure you , Lieutenant Hightower , eight hundred dollars would n't make a very large dent in my inheritance . " " Really ? Are you a millionairess ? " " Yes . "  | " As well-to-do as our host , " he said . " Oh , I rather think so . " " In other words , you rather think you are richer than he is . " " I should n't be at all surprised . On the other hand , I 'm not as rich as the Watsons . " " They 're almost too rich , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four horses , but not fourteen . And I do n't think I 'd care to live in that house on Delaware Avenue . I have a batman , an orderly , in the army . He has the duties of a servant , a valet . But Colonel Watson has a butler , valet , footman , coachman , groom , and I do n't know what else . He must have many more at the farm in Batavia . Have you been there ? " " Yes . " " Then you know their scale of living . It 's too grand for me . If I should leave the army , I 'd share bachelor quarters with another officer , and one man would do for the two of us . " " But you 're not going to share bachelor quarters . You 're going to marry me . You would love my house . I have Patrick , who was my father 's butler and coachman , and we have Rex and Ray , a pair of sorrels . I sold the farm to a cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to insist . My cousin would extract his pound of flesh , but he 's entitled to something . What are you thinking ? " " What am I thinking ? I was thinking about this conversation . It sounds like a storybook conversation , in a novel , yet it 's actually takingplace . Nothing surprises me any more , except the commonplace . That 's not quite what I 'm trying to say . Let 's put it this way . The first time I was ever under fire , it did n't seem possible that two hundred yards away , those men were actually firing shots at me . There they were , partly concealed by a rock formation , rocks that had been there since the beginning of time . Men that had been on earth  --  oh , twenty or thirty or forty years . They were members of an Indian tribe and not many of them live beyond forty . In between them and me was sand and sagebrush . All very commonplace , do n't you know ? And even the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all changed in the fraction of a second , when one of my men was picked off , in the middle of a sentence . He 'd never been under fire , either , and he was in the midst of saying something to me . Before he could complete the sentencehe was dead . I do n't mean to shock you with this grisly story , Miss Stokes , but you asked me what I was thinking and that was it . The unpredictability of things . "  | " Such as having a proposal of marriage from your dinner part-ner . " " Yes . " " I could have predicted it , though . As soon as I heard you were leaving on Saturday afternoon . I asked to be put next to you at table . " " Did you ? Then I believe you are quite serious . " " Oh , yes , " she said . " In that case , I accept . But I 'm so accustomed to rules and regulationsthat I must insist on one thing . " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Stokes , will you do me the honor of becoming my wife ? " " Yes , Lieutenant Hightower , I accept with great pleasure . " " Shall I rise and startle the guests with our announcement ? " " No , let 's wait . But some of them would n't be as startled as you might think , " she said . Even the Philadelphia banking Hightower came to the wedding when he learned that his cousin was marrying a Stokes . Dixon Hightower , no longer in the army , wore a Prince Albert , but his six ushers were in uniform and provided the arch of swords . The bride was given in marriage by the cousin who had purchased her farm , and Jessica Watson Fisher was matron of honor . The groom 's father , at the reception , could not resist saying to his banker cousin , " Well , Howard , the boy turned out a lot better than you expected . " " So it would seem , Cousin William , " said Howard Hightower . " Are you planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry quite as much , " said William Hightower . " You wo n't have to . We take care of her money , or some of it . " " Is n't that congenial ? " said William Hightower . The maladjustments between the bride and groom continued after their wedding night until well into the first year of their marriage , and were prevented from becoming disastrous only by their being treated as incidents of the night , not to be discussed in the daytime and never discussed at any great length when they occurred . " It hurts , " she would say . " It always hurts . " " It wo n't always , " he said . " Do you think we 'll ever have any children ? " " Do you want children that badly ? " " No . Do you ? "  | " I 'm in no hurry , " he said . " That means you really do n't , " she said . " But if I 'm ever going to , I ought to start now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an only child and so am I. Do you honestly want to have a child , Sophie ? " " I do n't think I do . And I 'm getting afraid . They say you should have your first before you 're thirty , and I 'm past that . " " Well , there 's only one way to have them , and we ca n't seem to do that . But we must n't let it worry us . Our life is very pleasant as it is , do n't you agree ? " " Oh , yes . I 'm happy . I hope you are . " " Of course I am , Sophie . And I 'm not at all sure if I 'm cut out for fatherhood . Children do n't like me . " " They do n't like me , either , " she said . " Then we need n't lose any sleep over that , " he said . By concentrating their sensual ministrations in the first hour of retirement , by ignoring their failure to achieve conventional coitus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that side of their married life . They were in no frenetic haste to produce offspring ; Sophie had never experienced heterosexual or homosexual orgasm ; and Dick , who had experienced both , showed her the ways by which she could produce orgasm in him , and for her there was enough excitement to give her pleasure . In the beginning she had been fearful that her failure might drive him away from her , and when it did not , when he turned out to be both patient and understanding , she acceptedtheir modus vivendi as the solution to a problem that existed as a problem only because other women had told her of other experiences . She refused to see a doctor , and Dick supported her in her wish to preserve the secret of her failure . Thus their days contained neither frustration nor the torments of it . Other things mattered more and occupied their thoughts . For her there was the running of the household , her gardening , her friends , her gossip ; for him there was the constant contrast between his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command ) and the years of military restrictions . He was gettingused to doing exactly what he wanted to do , without being required to supply explanation or excuse to anyone . For this he was learning to love Sophie , whose money had made his freedom possible , and he now loved the army for the preparation it had given him for this new life . He was easily persuaded to accept a captain 's commission on the governor 's staff , was promoted to major at the outbreak of the warp159with Spain , and returned from Tampa , Florida , a full colonel . He had been out of the Commonwealth a total of three months , quite long enough to convince him that his decision to resign from the Regular Army had been the right one . Sophie had convinced herself that his decision to resign had been a sacrifice on his part , and he allowed her to continue to believe it , since it was something she wanted , but what he wanted now was to keep what he had . A series of welcoming ceremonies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restored him to civilian life once more . Nearly half a century had passed since the town had been able to demonstrate its pride and gratitude to its military men , and the short duration of the hostilities with Spain and the absence of gunshot casualties was additional cause for rejoicing . Colonel Dixon L. Hightower was the man of the hour . There was even talk of running him for Congress . Not many outsiders had so quickly been adopted by the citizens of the town . In the name of the borough a group of men of substance presented to Dixon Hightower a dress sword from Bailey , Banks &; Biddle , at a subscription banquet in Odd Fellows Hall . But he had already , a week earlier , on the night of his return to 444 , received a welcome from Sophie that surprised her as much as him : in the course of their first embrace , with neither of them expecting more than there had ever been for them , they were possessed by an intensity , a drive , that was wholly instinctive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen ? " he said . " I was going to ask you , " she said . " Was it because we missed each other ? " " I guess so . It must have been , " she said . " And it did n't hurt ? " " Not really . I did n't notice it . Did it hurt you ? " " Pinched a little , but only a little . Nothing would have stopped me . " " Or me either , " she said . " You have n't been going to see a doctor or anything like that ? " " Nothing . But I missed you . Oh , I wanted you so much . Just to have you in the house with me . Every night I took something of yours to bed with me , held it to my bosom . " " And elsewhere ? " She nodded . " Yes , and elsewhere . " " What sort of thing ? " " Different things . A cravat . A riding crop . A muffler . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent you something of mine , but how could I tell you that in a letter ? " " I wish you had sent me something of yours , " he said . " Oh , dear . What would you have liked ? " " Oh  --  some intimate something . Something feminine . " " Something I 'd worn ? " she said . " Oh , yes . Lacy , satiny . " He got out of bed and turned up the burner . " What are you going to do ? " she said . " You must n't look . Close your eyes , or turn away till I tell you to look . " She turned away . " What on earth are you doing ? " she said . " Just be patient , and do n't look till I tell you , " he said . " You 're getting something of mine , I know that . " " Just be patient , " he said . " How much longer ? " " Count to fifty , slowly , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forties he said , " All right , now you can look . " He stood at the foot of their bed , and he was wearing an evening dress of hers and a pearl necklace , and on his head he had a silken scarf . " Dixon ! " she said . " Are you surprised ? " " You could almost be a woman , " she said . " I thought you 'd laugh , " he said . " I would have , but you even stand like a woman . A pretty woman , too . Not pretty , but handsome . You look a little like Madge Prestock . " " Well , that 's a compliment . Madge is a handsome woman , " he said . " Do you like me this way ? " " I do n't know , I 'm not sure . It 's such a surprise . How can you suddenly transform yourself ? Do you like to dress up like a woman ? " " I never have before , " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were smaller I could wear your shoes . The next time you go shopping , buy me a pair of high-heeled shoes . " " Do you mean it ? " " Yes . And a wig . You might have to go to Philadelphia for a wig . That place where you rent masquerade costumes . You know the place I mean , down on Chestnut Street . Van Something . " " What color wig ? "  | " Get two . Blond and brunette . Nobody else has to know , " he said . " They could be all your things , and do n't you think it would be fun ? " " I do n't know . I suppose so , " she said . " I 've always wanted to do this , " he said . " What about me ? Would you want me to dress up as a man ? " " Have n't you ever wanted to ? " " Oh  --  when I was little . " " Only when you were little ? Did n't you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume ? " " We were never allowed to . " " What would you have gone as if you 'd been allowed to ? " " A cowboy , with those white furry trousers . " " Chaparejos . Chaps . I have an old pair of leather ones in the attic . How would you like to put on my blues ? Not the breeches , but the trousers and short coat . " " Now ? " " Unfortunately they 're at the tailor 's , but you could put on one of my civilian suits if you 'd like . " " I 'd feel very strange , " she said . " We 'll do it some other time . " " You really want me to ? " " Yes , I do , " he said . " All right , I will . But I wo n't make as good a man as you do a woman . " " Oh , what difference does that make ? It 's just for the fun of it , you and I. Neither one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , now please come back to bed . " " I will if you undress me , " he said . " You mean as if I were a man ? " " There 's nothing wrong in it , Sophie . I do n't see anything wrong . We 're husband and wife . " " Yes , " she said . It became so that when she wanted him she would retire early and lay out lingerie , a dress , silk stockings and shoes on the chaiselonguein their bedroom . Without this preliminary , he could not be stimulated . He very soon tired of her awkward efforts to pose as a man . " I 'm afraid you 'll never learn to tie a four-in-hand , " he said . But he never grew weary of his own part in the game , and for the sake of its consummation she played it with him . " I bought you a nice present today , " she would say . " Do n't ask me what it is . You 'll see itp162sometime this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bracelet , an article of lingerie . In the mornings before breakfast she would put everything away , out of sight of her chambermaid , and he would shave and dress with no word , no look , no conspiratorial smile that referred to the rites of the night before . At breakfast he would read his newspaper and make his comments on the events of the outside world . He was the same man , because she knew him to be , and as she said about once a year , if other people knew him as she did they would realize that he was one of the most fascinating men you could ever hope to meet.  |p163Red  Walters watched the Hofman Pierce-Arrow pull away from the gas tank . He continued to wave his hand , although Mrs. Hofman was as always staring straight ahead . " There 's no doubt about it , " said Red Walters . " The bigger they are , the nicer they are . " " You 're right , " said his partner , Charlie Connors . " The bigger they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much she 's worth ? " said Red Walters . " Well , I heard reports she had over a million , " said Charlie . " A million ? She come into over a million when the old man passedaway . She must be worth over two million , if not three , " said Red . " Three million dollars , " said Charlie . " Most people would besatisfied if they had one . " " Did you ever stop to think how much the income is on a million dollars ? " " The income ? No , I do n't guess I ever did , " said Charlie . " Well , if them stocks and bonds give her a five-percent return , that comes to fifty thousand dollars a year on one million . You take and multiply that by three  --  " " A hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year ? " said Charlie . " A hundred and fifty thousand a year just in income , " said Red Walters . " That 's what she got coming in . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a week , " said Charlie . " Well , it ai n't all clear . Some of it goes into taxes , " said Red . " But supposing she paid out a thousand a week in taxes , that still leaves her two thousand dollars . " " That old lady got two thousand dollars coming in every week , " said Charlie.  | " Somewhere around that figure , " said Red . " Seven into two thousand , " said Charlie . Red nodded . " Pretty close to three hundred a day . " " Three hundred dollars a day . When you look at it that way  --  what would we do if we took in three hundred dollars a day , Red ? " " We 'll never take in no three hundred dollars a day in this location . We 're lucky if we take in that much in a week . " " Yeah , and how many weeks do we come near that much ? " said Charlie . " Not so many , and with us it ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact , " said Charlie . " If we can split up a hundred between us , week in and week out , we had a good year . " " Well , we been doing that , Red . Sometimes more . " " I know , but we do n't put anything back in . You take your fifty , I take my fifty , and all we are is standing still . " " Yeah , but if I come home at the end of the week with forty dollars instead of fifty , Mary would let out a yell you could hear in the next county . " " Bess , too . She would n't let out a yell , but she 'd start crying , and that 's just as bad if not worse . They 're so used to the fifty , they never stop and think if the two of us put back five a week , inside of a year that 'd come to five hundred and twenty dollars . " " That 's right , " said Charlie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank and borrow the money for a better location . We got ta get a better location and that 's all there is to it , Charlie . Old Lady Holman was running out of gas or we never would of had her for a customer . You heard what she said to me . " " No , I was pumping , " said Charlie . " Well , she said to me she did n't know I was in this business . She remembered from before the war when I used to deliver her papers . Always five dollars every Christmas . The only one I ever got five dollars from , and I was the only one got five dollars from anybody . There was n't another kid in town delivering papers that got five dollars . Not that she give it to me herself , but the butler did . Most kids were lucky to get a quarter . " " I never had a paper route , " said Charlie . " What we used to do , during Christmas the paper gave us calendarsto deliver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery , but the customers were supposed to give you a little something . Some gavep165a dime , some a quarter . But Old Lady Hofman 's butler gave me a fi ' - dollar bill . Four of it I kept . My mom did n't know how much I got from any of the customers , but she knew I got something . So I said I got a dollar from Old Lady Hofman and kept the other four for my-self . " " What 'd you do with the other four ? " said Charlie . " I hid it to run away with . The old man used to beat me , and my mom did , too , so I used to save up till I got enough money so I could run away . " " You never run away , did you ? " said Charlie . Red shook his head . " No . She found it . Sixteen dollars and fortyfivecents in one of them Bull Durham sacks the Bull Durham tobacco used to come in . " " Sure , I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie . " Where did you hide it , that she found it ? " " Under the mattress on my bed . Then one day she decided to turn it over when I was at school , and there it was . They both beat me . They asked me where I stole it . And when I finally told them the truth , they beat me like I stole it from them . Sixteen dollars and fortyfivecents . I was saving up till I got twenty , and then I was gon na run away . " " Huh . " " You know , thinking about that , Old Lady Hofman coming here got me thinking about it . If I did n't put it off , if I ran away when I had the sixteen forty-five , I 'd of been out of this town and God knows where the hell I 'd be , but I would n't be here . " " Where were you going ? " said Charlie . " Philly . You remember , I was a pretty husky kid for fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , and if I did n't get a job I was gon na join the navy . Once I was gone they would n't of worried about me . All they gave a God damn about was my paper route . Every week if she did n't take the money off me first , he would . We got paid on Friday . My route was all the way out Lantenengo Street starting at Second . I got a fiat rate of a dollar a week . I was supposed to get more , but the son of a bitch in charge of delivery would take your route away from you if you did n't split with him . Pay him , or lose your route , and that was all there was to it . Johnny Minzer . " " Oh , that son of a bitch , " said Charlie . " Crazy Artie 's brother . " " I made three hundred and eighty-four deliveries a week , and Iwas supposed to get a cent for each . Three dollars and eighty-fourcents a week . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . Myp166parents did . Who pays for your shoe leather ? ' my old man used to say . Yeah , and who paid for my left shoulder being lower than the right , from carrying those papers six days a week ? They say Johnny Minzer made over a hundred dollars a week , stealing from us , and it all went for booze and whores . You remember when he got killed on that motorcycle ? We did n't shed no tears . " " I 'll bet you did n't , " said Charlie . " We sure did n't , " said Red . " The only thing I was sorry for , it happened too late to do me any good . " " Oh , yeah , that was after we got out of the army , " said Charlie . " The summer of ' 19 , " said Red . " Right around there sometime , " said Charlie . " I 'm surprised he did n't try to take your calendar money . " " Try to ? He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a half a buck . If he ever knew Old Lady Hofman used to give me five bucks , he would of delivered the calendar himself . But he figured the most anybody gave was a quarter , and some of the cheapskates did n't give us a nickel . Some of the maids give us a dime that I bet they were supposed to give us more . " " I guess they could n't see giving a kid more than a dime , " said Charlie . " No , but they should of given us what we were entitled to , " said Red . " I 'm positive some of them maids held out on me . Bess had an aunt cooking for one of the Stokeses . I always meant to ask her if she knew anything about it , because those particular Stokeses 'd be the kind that 'd shell out better than a dime . The Stokeses and Old Lady Hofmanwere related . " " You ca n't always tell by that , " said Charlie . " No . Some were stingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was I thinking ? I was thinking about something I wanted to tell you . " " Uh  --  about Johnny Minzer ? " " No , no , no , no , no . About Old Lady Hofman , " said Red . " Search me . We were saying how rich she was . " " Yeah . That had something to do with it , " said Red . " Something she said when you were talking to her , " said Charlie . " I wish to hell I could remember . Wait a minute ! She said she did n't know I was in this business , and that got me thinking , if we got a better location , there 's people like Old Lady Hofman would just as soon give us their business . They used to like me when I was carryingpapers , a lot of those people . "  | " Well , there 's plenty of good locations , if we had the money . " " I know ! That got me started on if we kept out five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know what that 's around ? That 's around five-percent interest on ten thousand dollars . " " Those things I leave to you , Red . You know me and arithmetic . " " Well , just supposing the bank would lend us ten thousand dollars at five percent . They 'd want more , but around that figure . Just say ten thousand we borrowed and five hundred we paid interest . We 'd take in more than we take in here , Charlie . A good location , say out around Eighteenth and Market , out that way . If we had a good locationwe 'd stand a much better chance of getting an agency . Christ knows we 'll never get an agency if we stay here . Here we ca n't even get a good tire agency , let alone a car . I do n't say we 'd get an agency right off the bat , but if we had a halfway decent garage in a good location , they 'd come to us . " " You mean the manufacturers ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it sounds all right to me , Red . I would n't be afraid to work on any kind of a car on the road today . I could run the shop , all right , providing you ran the business end . And the selling . You 'd have to do the selling . Like the fellow says , I could n't sell a life preserver to a guy that was going down the third time . But the mechanical end I would n't be afraid to tackle . " " What I was thinking a while back , " said Red . " There I saved up that sixteen dollars and forty-five cents . Three fifty-five to go and I was ready to run away . What happened ? My mom discovered where I hid it , and all I got out of it was a couple of beatings off of her and my old man . I waited too long . I should of lit out when I had fifteen dollars .

How do you know you 're not better off here ? " " Here ? What do I have here ? The both of us put in ten to twelve hours every day , and if we do n't bring home that fifty bucks every week , we got one of our wives yelling bloody murder and the other one bawling her head off like it was the end of the world . Your kids and my kids are too young to show any appreciation , but they never will , Charlie . Their mothers got them thinking the same way . Bess would n't even let one of my kids pull weeds out of the neighbor 's garden . I wo n't have my children pulling no weeds for the neighbors , ' she says .

" " I 'd get in my car and drive downtown to the bank . Right now , " said Red . " No , I guess they close at three o'clock . " " You mean without talking it over with the women ? " said Charlie . " Without talking it over with the women . I 'd go down there to that bank , and if they gave me any encouragement , this week we 'd start . You keep out five dollars , I 'd keep out five dollars .

I got them to pay for . " " I got them kind of things , too , " said Red . " Bess makes me carry a lot of insurance , as if she was afraid I was gon na croak . But you got ta back me up the same as I got ta back you up . That 's the first thing they 'll want to know . Is Charlie taking five dollars less ? Is Red taking five dollars less ?

I do n't think it come over me all of a sudden . I think I had the feeling a long time . " " You know what I think ? " said Charlie . " No , what ?

It was a fortyeight-footboat , obviously built before Pearl Harbor . Through the binocularsBlair could read " Jama " and " Ft . Lauderdale , Fla. " on the stern . He had never seen the boat before , and would not have paid particular attention to it now but for the fact that since early morning no one had come on deck . Blair had first noticed the boat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean ; then he saw it twice again on his way to and from the village around ten o'clock . Boats that lay in the bay overnight were usually under way by noon , especially on a Monday , but the Jama was still there at three o'clock in the afternoon , and Blair had seen no signs of life on it . " What are you looking at ? " said Jessie Blair . " That cruiser , " said Blair . " You thinking of buying it ? " said Jessie Blair . It was an old family joke that if Dave Blair looked twice at any boat he was sure to make another offer for it . " Well , maybe I 'd get it cheap , " he said . " Why ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " It may be abandoned . There does n't seem to be a soul aboard . Here , take a look . " He handed her the binoculars . She put the strap around her neck and adjusted the lenses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fort Lauderdale , Florida . No , I do n't see anybody , but they may have gone ashore . " " How ? Walked , or swam ? Their dinghy 's hanging right there . " " They could have got a ride from George Miller , " she said.  | " They could have , but I doubt it . They could also have spent the night ashore and are n't back yet , but I doubt that too . Or , they could have spent the night on another boat , but the only other boat that was there this morning pulled out around ten o'clock . " " Ah , the mystery is solved ! " said Jessie . Simultaneously they saw a man come on deck . " Let me have those , " said Dave Blair . " Hold your horses , I want to have a look at him too , " said Jessie . " Will you please give me the God damn glasses , " said Dave . " He does n't look like much , " said Jessie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing his beard . All right , here . " She handed him the binoculars . " And do n't forget to put the strap around your neck . " " I 'm not the one that forgets , " said Dave . He readjusted the lenses , and saw a man in khaki shorts and a blue work shirt that was not tucked in and wearing blue sneakers . " He looks like a lot of guys on Monday morning . " " Only it 's Monday afternoon , " said Jessie . " For him I think it 's early Monday morning . He 's drinking a cup of coffee , or I suppose it 's coffee . If it was n't coffee he 'd be drinking out of the bottle . He has n't brushed his hair . Ah , the plot thickens . " " Is that a woman ? " " It sure as hell is a woman , " said Dave . " Is she pretty ? " " She does n't have to be , " said Dave . " She 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And get tired of very quickly . Unless she has something else to offer . " " Oh , I imagine she can probably cook . She 's not a glamor girl type , judging from her clothes . Shorts , and a man 's skivvy shirt . " " Why do you think she can cook ? " " She 's pouring him another cup of coffee out of a percolator . Therefore it is n't instant coffee . Which of course he may have made , but I give her the benefit of the doubt . I wonder if she 's the Ja or the Ma ? " " What ? " said Jessie . " The Jama . She could be Jane and he could be Max . Or he could be James and she could be Mary . Ja-Ma . But do you know what I think ? I think neither one of them is Ja or Ma . I do n't think they ownp172the boat . That boat 's a good twenty-five years old , but I do n't think he owns it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would shell out thirty or forty thousand dollars for that kind of boat . " " How can you tell ? " " I do n't know , but you can , " said Dave . " Even at this distance you just know they do n't belong to that boat . That boat was built for people that are probably long since dead , and now it belongs to someoneelse . But not the people we 're looking at . " " You 're making a wild guess , " said Jessie . " Naturally . But they just do n't seem at home on that boat . They do n't look like boat people . He does , but she does n't . " " There 's no such thing as boat people any more , " said Jessie . " I guess you 're right , " said her husband . " Ah , now we 're getting somewhere , " said Jessie . She saw a third person , a man , come out of the cabin . " What does he look like ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave . " She 's pouring him a cup of coffee . He 's seating himself in a deck chair . Yes , he 's the owner . He has that manner . I 'm beginning to figure it out . He 's the owner , the other guy is a paid hand . The woman is either the paid hand 's wife or the owner 's girl friend . " " Why not the owner 's wife ? " said Jessie . " Well , she could be , but I doubt it . I know she could n't be the paid hand 's girl friend , because the owner would n't allow that . The owner is a man in his fifties . He 's wearing khaki pants and a flowery shirt , and that 's a fisherman 's cap . One of those caps with a long peak that deep-sea fishermen wear . I would say that he 's retired from business and probably spends most of his time on his boat . He probably lives aboard . They 're on their way to Florida for the winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotia . That 's not a deck chair . It 's a swivel chair , for fishing . There are two of them . The boat has n't got a pulpit , but it has dual controls , and the bridge is pretty high up so it does n't need a pulpit . I do n't see any fishing rods , but they 're probably stowed away until they get to Florida . They 'll go by way of the Inland route , so they wo n't do any deep-sea fishing till they get to Fort Lauderdale . " " You 're consumed with curiosity , " said Jessie . " Why do n't you go call on them ? " " I would , if I had some excuse . Do you want to come with me ? " " No , I have too much to do . All those things to put away for the winter . " " Do you want any help ? "  | " No thanks . It 's the bedlinen and bath towels and so on , and you do n't know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like those people . You go call on them and tell me all about it . You do n't need an elaborate excuse . Just take the boat and ask them if everything 's all right . After all , what can they do ? They can thank you and ask you to come aboard for a drink , or they can tell you to mind your own busi-ness . " " All right , " said Dave . He left the house and went down to the bay and started up his outboard . He proceeded into the channel , moving slowly and trying to appear casual . He passed the lama , waved to the people on deck and received a wave in return from the woman and the owner . He swung around and went alongside the Jama and throttled his motor down . " Hi , everything okay ? " he called to the men and woman . " Everything okay , thanks , " said the owner . " Why ? What made you ask ? " " Well , I was a little worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might be having trouble . " The owner laughed . " No , no trouble , thanks . Care to come aboard and have a drink with us ? " " Never been known to refuse , " said Dave . He handed the painter to the man in shorts , and went aboard . " My name is Blair . Dave Blair . I live in that grey cottage on top of the dune . " " Jack Harrison is my name , " said the owner . " Welcome aboard . This is Bob Lewis , and Mrs. Lewis . " " Pleased to meet you , " said Lewis . " Howdia do ? " said Mrs. Lewis . The Lewises were not quite hostile . " This bay can be tricky after a good blow . The bottom shifts , and a boat this size could run aground , " said Dave . " Oh , we took soundings , " said Harrison . " I 've been through here before , other years . What will it be , Mr. Blair ? We have beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can name . Personally I like to start the day with a Tom Collins . But you name your own libation . " " A Tom Collins would be fine , " said Dave . " Bob , will you do the honors ? Betty ? What are you having ? " " Oh , I guess a Collins , " said Mrs. Lewis . " We 're all three somewhat the worse for wear today , " said Harrison . " We started tying one on , I do n't know , I guess about four o'clock yesterday afternoon and decided to go ashore for dinner . The fellow that runs the boatyard , George  --  "  | " George Miller , " said Dave . " He came out and got us . I blew for him and he came out and got us and we had dinner at a place called the El Mirador . Was n't that the name of it , Betty ? " " God , do n't ask me , " said Mrs. Lewis . " Yes , the El Mirador , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat around here . " " Wonderful lobster , " said Harrison . " And I happen to like Rhine wine with lobster . So we hung around there till ha ' past eleven or quarter of twelve , and then George Miller very kindly brought us back to my boat . He could n't stay and have a nightcap with us , but I guess we three must of kept at it till daylight . " " You two did . I did n't , " said Betty Lewis . " It got too cold . " " Yeah , but you stuck it out till four or five o'clock . I honestly do n't know what time I finally hit the sack , but I can tell you one thing . I was as drunk as any white man from here to Key West . The only way to get back to civilization is to take one of Bob 's Tom Collinses . Thank you , Robert . Mr. Blair , glad to have you aboard . " " Thank you , " said Dave . He gestured with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Harrison smiled . " Well , I like her . I bought her just before the war . She 's named after my wife and I. Jack and May Harrison . My wife passed on some years ago , but I kept the name in memory of her . I was thinking of changing the name , but you heard that superstition about changing a boat 's name . I do n't believe there 's anything to it , but I did n't want to go against it . And besides , everybody liked May and they all thought it was a kind of a nice tribute , if you know what I mean . Yes , I 've had this boat over twenty-five years , now . I bought her practically brand new from a friend of mine in Jacksonville , Florida . You can see she was built before the war . Nothing plastic about this boat . You can take a look inside and notice the woodwork , the panelingand all that . During the war I used to do patrol duty with her . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the east coast . They were sinking our tankers right and left . That was how I happened to meet Bob , here . Bob was in the Coast Guard and I was in the Auxiliary . What were you , Bob ? About twenty ? " " Nineteen , when I enlisted , " said Lewis . He pulled on his cigarette , exposing his lower teeth as he breathed the smoke into his lungs . " Put in altogether fifty-one months . " " Bob signed on with me the latter part of ' 45 , and been with me ever since . Betty , you signed on in ' 58 , was n't it ? Not that she signedp175on , but practically . Betty knows as much about Jama as Bob or I. One of these days she 's gon na take a course in navigation and then she 'll be the real skipper . " " That 'll be the day , " said Betty Lewis . " It is n't much of a life for a young woman , I 'll agree with you there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way to save your money , living on the boat ten months of the year . Bob and Betty have this apartment in Lauderdale they occupy during the fall , and I go and stay in a hotel in Jacksonville , while the boat 's being overhauled . You a native of these parts , Mr. Blair ? " " Yes , as a matter of fact I was born here . My family have been coming here for the summer ever since I can remember . Ordinarily we make our home in Englewood , New Jersey , my wife and I. Our childrenare all married  --  " " You live retired ? " said Harrison . " Yes , I guess you 'd call it that . I 've more or less turned over the family business to my two sons . We 're in the pottery business . " " Oh , that Blair . I heard of them , " said Betty . She was less hostile . She turned to her husband . " You know those blue cups and saucers we have at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to my mother . You know , those heavy blue cups and saucers ? They 're practically unbreakable . " " Or you 'd of broke them by this time , " said Bob . " Ah , shut up , " said Betty . " Jack , we 're gon na need more ice and a few things . I think what I 'll do , I 'll take the puddle-jumper and go get what we need , " said Bob Lewis . " How much will you need ? " said Harrison . " You better give me about twenty dollars , " said Bob . " Mm-hmm . " Harrison took a roll of bills from his pants pocket . He slipped a wide rubber band off the bills and back over his wrist in a single practiced motion . Dave Blair saw tens , twenties , fifties , and hundred-dollar bills in the roll . Harrison pulled out a twenty and handed it to Lewis . " There you are , " said Harrison . " Are you takingBetty with you ? Do we need any canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think I 'll go with him . I guess there 's a drug store in the town ? " " Yes , " said Blair . " It 's on the principal corner . " " I want to get a few things for myself . What time we shoving off , Jack ? "  | " Well , I do n't know . We 'll have to decide that when you get back . It gets dark earlier , and it 's twenty-five to four . " " Well , for Christ 's sake , we 're not gon na lay around here and get gassed again , are we ? Another whole day shot to hell , and you said we 'd be home in two weeks . Those two weeks 'll be up Wednesday . If we keep on like this I 'm gon na take the train . " " Now , Betty , I 'll make it up to you , " said Harrison . Betty Lewis turned to Blair . " These two sit around and get gassed every single night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the difference if we get home this Wednesday or next Wednesday ? " said her husband . " Because I wanta get off this crummy boat and wear some decentclothes for a change , that 's what 's the difference , " said Betty . " You looked pretty nice last night , Betty , " said Harrison . " That 's the same dress I been wearing ever since we came north , " said Betty Lewis . " Well , I 'll blow you to a new one when we get home . Bob , will you fix us a couple more of these before you go ? " " Not for me , thanks , " said Blair . " Me , then , " said Harrison . He held up his empty glass . " Hold on to your hats , here we go again , " said Betty . Much as it was like being an outsider in the midst of a family dispute , Dave Blair was less embarrassed than curious . Jack Harrison was in his sixties , not his fifties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age was more easily determinable , assuming he had enlistedin the Coast Guard in 1942 . Twenty-two plus nineteen was forty-one . The nature of the relationship between Harrison and Lewis and between Harrison and Betty Lewis was more difficult to determine , but it was apparent that Harrison had formed some kind of attachment for each of them . He was a vigorous man , who had doubtlessbeen , in spite of his sentimentality about his wife , a womanizer in his day . Blair could almost hear Harrison , at a convention in a hotel , sending for the girls , and such a man  --  any man  --  would be sure to take note of Betty Lewis 's shape . She had a peinaanent frown , the result of her self-consciousness about her figure and its effect on men . She was not pretty , and Blair made a guess that Bob had first met her as a call girl . It would be natural enough for her to marry Bob Lewis to escape from the dreariness of prostitution , but Blair was also inclined to believe that Jack Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted that Lewis would marry Betty without some encouragement from Harrison , the meal ticket . Lewis gave Harrison his fresh drink , and he and Betty lowered the dinghy and cast off . " I could have let them borrow my boat , " said Dave Blair . " I should have offered it to them . " " No , there 's no telling when they 'll be back . They 'll find some saloon and start an argument . They 've been spoiling for a fight , those two . I could see it coming all last week , and when they fight , they fight , believe you me . You know , she 's quite a husky girl , Betty . " " To say the least , " said Blair . " She can take care of herself . A month or so ago we were fishing one day off Nantucket , going for swordfish as I recall it . Yes . That was how it started . She said she never caught a swordfish , and I said well she could probably catch one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big bugger he was . I would n't guess what he weighed , but I said to her if she boated him I 'd make her a present of having him stuffed . Well sir , you ought to see her playing that fish , the sweat pouring off of her till she was soaked to the skin . " He paused . " I never saw her so excitedbefore , rocking back and forth there for forty or fifty minutes . I just sat there and watched her . Bob was at the wheel , up on the bridge , and he was trying to help her as much as he could . But then I do n't know , all of a sudden he gave it the gun and the boat jumped forward and that did it . The line snapped , Betty was thrown back , and she lost the fish . She did n't lose the tackle , fortunately . That 'd of cost me in the neighborhood of four hundred dollars , all told . But she just reeled in her line and got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled off and socked him one on the chin so hard he went overboard . One punch . I guess he was n't ready for it , but even so . One punch . I yelled to her to stop the boat , but she yelled back Leave the son of a bitch drownd . ' I had to go up there myself and take the wheel , or Mr. Bob Lewis would be feeding the fishes today . You ought to seen her hands . Raw . And she 's used to fishing . But she wanted that swordfish if it took all the flesh off her hands . Then what did she do ? Just like a woman , she bust out crying . Here was a woman that battled a fish for over a half an hour , and knocked her husband over the side with one punch , and was satisfied to let him drown . But then when it was all over she started crying like some kid that you took away her lollipop . She 's some woman , Betty . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Buffalo , New York . Between you and me and the bedpost , I think she used to be a hooker . I do n't believe any of the stories she tells about herself . Some of them I believe . She said she was a snake charmer , first with a carnival and then in the night clubs . She used to get extra for doing the act without any clothes on , at smokers . I believe that . Who 'd make up a story like that ? But most of the other stuff is the bunk , like she says she had this old fellow that put her up in an apartment on Park Avenue , and the stories she tells about him . Right in front of Bob , her own husband . But she wo n't ever admit she was a hooker . " " How did he get to know her , her husband ? " " In a saloon . A night club kind of a joint in Miami . She was a Bgirl . You know , they order beer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went in there one night , Bob and I , and she came over and sat down with us . The next thing I knew a couple days later Bob asked me for the loan of five hundred dollars so he could marry her . The way I figured , if he had a wife he 'd be better off than if he stayed single . Steady him down a little . So I gave him the five hundred for a wedding present and we took her along our next trip out . She called it her honeymoon . Bob said she told her friends she was going on her honeymoon on a yacht . But she did her share of the work , and pretty soon she could do everything a paid hand can do . I do n't give her a salary , but I make her a present at Christmastime , which amounts to a little more than I 'd pay a deckhand . There 's only one trouble with Betty . " " What 's that ? " said Blair . " I 'm escared of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me give him twenty dollars . Well , that 's the last I 'll ever see of that . They wo n't bring back any change . You come here asking if we were having any trouble , and I said no . What else could I say ? But I do n't know if we 'll ever make Fort Lauderdale . Me , that is . I can drink him under the table , and I do . As long as I can get him drunk the two of them ca n't gang up on me . She would n't do anything alone . " " Like what ? " said Blair . " Anything , " said Harrison . " She would of let him drown and all he did was keep her from boating a swordfish . I can see you 're a gentleman , Mr. Blair , or I would n't feel free to tell you these things . Here I am , a man of sixty-five years of age and well-to-do . I took a fancy to Bob and more or less adopted him . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of us used to kind of play around together . Night clubs and such stuff . Then he married Betty and she 's been withp179us ever since . I have to tell you this to give you the complete picture . You see , a couple of times I had relations with her . I ought to had more sense , but you have that walking around the boat all day and night and I made a little pass at her . I thought maybe she 'd laugh it off , but as soon as Bob left the boat she said now was our chance . Happened I guess four or five times all told , but she has that on me . " " You sure Lewis does n't know anything about it ? " " I wondered a little , but I do n't think he does . I think she 's savingthat up for when she wants to get him real mad at me . When that will be , I do n't know . But it 'll be sometime . " He swirled the ice around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fort Lauderdale , I 'm going to sell my boat . " " You do n't have to do that , do you ? Ca n't you just fire Lewis ? " " I wish it was that simple . No , I 'd have to get rid of the two of them all at once . Tell them to take their two months off and put the boat in the yard for the annual overhaul . But put the boat up for sale . That 's the best time of year to sell a boat . And in the meantime I could go away somewhere . California . Europe . They 'd think I was still holed up in the hotel in Jacksonville . I 'll hate to sell the lama , but it 's the only way out for me . " " Mr. Harrison , if you really believe they 're going to do something to you , you ought to go to the police . " " And tell them what ? Tell them they 're plotting to do away with me ? The first question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You know , I never realized it till lately , but I 'm all alone in the world . I have some nephews and nieces I never even see , scattered all over the United States . No , there 's nothing for me to do , Mr. Blair . But I feel a little better talking about it . I knew you were a nice man , a gentleman , as soon as I saw you . " " Well , I 'd like to help you if I knew how , " said Blair . " The trouble is , she 's beginning to get suspicious . You took noticehow the two of them kind of did n't want you to come aboard . " " I thought that was my imagination , " said Blair . " No . They had to know all about you . When you said your familyowned the Blair pottery business , she knew you were n't some kind of a cop , or lawyer . She never would of left the boat , otherwise . " " Well , now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back without you , or the police would start asking questions . " " They do n't have to go back to Lauderdale . There 's any number of places they could go , where they would n't be too particular about who owned the lama . Castro would n't mind having a boat like this ,  |p180and  Bob knows people in Miami that are against Castro . They might like to buy it . You could cross the Atlantic Ocean in the Jama . There 's a place over in Africa called Tangiers , where they say they do a lot of smuggling . A couple years back two fellows , foreigners , offered me fifteen thousand for the Jama . She 's worth over twice that , but I stalled them to find out what they wanted to do with her . They would n't tell me much , but Bob said they were some kind of smugglers . Maybe I should of sold her then and let Bob go with them . " " I 'm almost tempted to make you an offer myself , " said Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good price if it was n't for Bob and Betty . You see , Mr. Blair , the whole damn trouble is , what if it 's only my imagination ? You know . A guilty conscience on account of monk'ing around with Bob 's wife . I take precautions . I wo n't go out in bad weather , and if they decide to dump me overboard they have to do it in broad daylight . But what if we get to Fort Lauderdale and nothing happened ? " " Would you still sell the boat ? " said Blair . " Yes . If we get to Lauderdale the first thing I 'm gon na do is kneel down and kiss the ground , and then I 'm going to send Bob and Betty off on their vacation and put the Jama up for sale . " " When you do , will you send me a telegram ? Let me know what your price is . " " I can tell you that right now . Twenty-five thousand , as is . You want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think 1 'd better get back . My wife is getting ready to close our house , and I ought to be there to help her . " He rose and shook hands with Harrison . " Enjoyed talking to you , Mr. Blair . I chewed your ear off , but it did me a lot of good . That 's David Blair , Midhampton , Long Island , will get you ? " " They 'll forward any mail or telegrams . " " I 'd like to see a nice married couple own the Jarna . That 's what I got her for originally . " " I 'd like to hear from you , even if you do n't sell her . I 'd feel better , knowing you got there safe and sound , " said Blair . Harrison looked off toward the village . " Well , Mr. Blair , if you do n't hear from me in three weeks  --  say by the fifteenth of October  --  you might just drop a line to the chief of police at Fort Lauderdale . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . " " I 'll do that , " said Blair . " You can say you had this conversation with me , and I askedp181you to notify them . You do n't have to get mixed up in it . Write them anonymously if you want to . " " No , I 'd sign my name , " said Blair . " I just do n't want to disappear from the face of the earth and nobody ever know what happened to me , " said Harrison . He threw his cigarette into the bay , making sure that it hit the water . " I was n't always on the side of the law . I made my money cutting a few corners , you might say . But I never did time , and I made a will . It 'll all go to my nieces and nephews that I do n't even know their names . Maybe some good 'll come of the money that way . " He lit a fresh cigarette . " Not that I was ever a good man , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever say I was mean . " Blair , with a quick glance , saw that tears had come to Harrison 's eyes . " Thanks for the drink , Mr. Harrison . Let me hear from you , " he said . He let himself down into his boat and started up the motor . He looked up at Harrison , whose eyes were now filled with tears , standing on the deck and nodding , nodding , making no effort to speak over the noise of the outboard engine . Blair waved once and pulled away and did not look back.  |p182James  Francis Hatter , the writer , having eaten his usual large breakfast and finished with the Los Angeles newspapers , took a second cup of coffee and the Hollywood trade papers out on the terrace , and insideof two minutes the day that had started so well  --  well , it was utterly ruined for him . All because of one little item in one of the chatter columns . " Town buzzing over chic dinner party tossed by Rod Fulton to celebrate his return to local scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pix in Italy and London . His new Holmby Hills manse a real smasher , " said the item , and followed with a dozen names of Fulton 's guests . The names were old and new , but all big .

Not too long ago James Francis Hatter would have been at the airport to greet him . A very long time ago James Francis would have been at the Pasadena station when Rod came in on the SuperChief . And still longer ago Rod Fulton would have been at the station to meet James Francis , helping James Francis with his luggage and leading the way to James Francis 's car . Rod would have got the girls and reserved the table at the Troc for James Francis 's first night home . He would have washed James Francis 's Packard convertible , and on the ride down from Pasadena to Beverly Hills , Rod would have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls that had come in during James Francis 's absence .

"  | " Well , you 're getting there , slowly by degrees . You 're the one ought to start taking the exercise , Jimmy . I mean it . " " Oh , one of these days I 'm going to buy a fly swatter . " " A fly swatter ? You mean a tennis racket ? " " No , I mean a fly swatter . " " You bastard , I never know when you 're ribbing me , " said Rod Fulton . The cash debt had mounted to three thousand before Rod was able to start repaying it , and it took three pictures rather than two for his career to get in high gear . But thereafter there never was any doubt about it . He was a star , a big , dumb , youthful man whom women wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing with or to give him a good punch in the mouth . He bought a house of his own on North Roxbury , quite a distance from James Francis Hatter 's house high above the Sunset Strip , but he did not cease to be grateful to James Francis . " This is the guy , this is the one guy that had confidence in me when I did n't have it in myself , " he would say . And he would express it in other ways than words . If James Francis happened to be working on the same lot , he and Rod would have lunch together every day . When James Francis was working somewhere else Rod would call him on the telephone just to chin , or to talk about getting a couple of broads . James Francis went along for the ride when Rod took a trip to Oregon to fish for steelheads , and at Rod 's request , his studio paid all of James Francis 's expenses on Rod 's first visit to Europe . It was only James Francis 's second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveledas much as Lowell Thomas . Actually the studio was relieved that Rod had not insisted on taking some broad . He was at the momenthaving a secret romance with a waitress at the Beverly Derby as well as a widely publicized affair with Doris Arlington , and the studio wanted the European public to think of him as unattached . The only unpleasantness of the trip occurred when an Englishwomanof title invited Rod to her house for the weekend , and Rod said he would have to ask Jimmy . " Jimmy ? Is that Hatter ? " she asked . " But surely you do n't take your orders from your secretary ? " " He 's not my secretary . " " Oh , I see . " " He 's my friend . " " Yes , exactly . Well , in that case that does change things , does n't it ? "  | " He happens to be one of the highest-paid writers in Hollywood . He got me started in pictures . " " Oh , yes . Well , you see I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would be just you and I and another couple , friends of mine . Mr. Hatter being there would complicate things , would n't it ? " " I do n't know . Would it ? " " Yes , rather . My friends are n't married , to each other , that is . She has to be awfully careful , and I 'm afraid she 'd back out if a total stranger  --  " " I 'm a total stranger , " said Rod . " Not to me . " " Well , no , " said Rod . " Get another girl for Jimmy . " " A girl ? " " Well of course a girl . He may be getting fat , but he 's one of the greatest swordsmen in Hollywood . " " He is ? You could n't be mistaken about that , of course . " " What the hell are you hinting at ? You do n't think Jimmy is a fag , do you ? " " As a mattrafact I did . " " Then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rodney , do n't put me in the spot . " " On the spot . In the spot is lighting . On the spot is what you 're trying to say . " " I do n't know what I 'm trying to say , " she said . " Yes I do ! I 'm just afraid that as we ca n't possibly have Mr. Hatter , and I 've promisedSybil  --  she has to be so careful now  --  I 'm going to have to disinviteyou , dear boy . " " Six , two , and even Sybil would end up in the kip with Jimmy , whoever Sybil is . " " If only you knew , you 'd be bloody well impressed , Mr. Fulton . " " Not me . I do n't know these English broads . Jimmy does , but I do n't . " " Then all the more reason for not having your Jimmy person . No , you and I must make other plans . " " We do n't have to . Anyway , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , really . I should have known . He does n't look like a secretary . " She was talking to herself . " Darling , you will have lunch with me Tuesday . At my flat ? One-ish ? "  | " No can do . All day Tuesday I 'll be at Elstree . " " You and Jimmy ? " " That 's right , me and Jimmy , " he said . The countess 's suspicions of James Francis were as natural to her , as automatic and unthinking as Rod 's defense of him . Neverthelessnow that someone had come right out and said it , thus showing that someone else had thought it , Rod admitted to himself that he had wondered a little about James Francis . Various kinds of homo were nothing new to Rod , particularly after he had got his first job as a chorus boy in the road company of a Broadway musical . On several occasions , when the money was low , he had allowed them to seduce him , and at the beginning of his friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . But when weeks passed and James Francis had continued to treat him as half-brother , half-servant , and unemployed friend , Rod stopped waiting for that other shoe to drop . The actor who had told Rod to look up James Francis was an older , fortyish , hard-drinking , saloon-brawling man , who had a speaking part in the road show . His tastes , like James Francis 's , were for women and booze . He completely ignored the queens among the chorus boys . If Rod had had no show business experience he might never have had the slightest suspicion of James Francis , and such as he had soon vanished . James Francis had never married and he was often content to sit alone and listen to highbrow music on the phonograph . He read a lot . But he was a writer , the first successful writer Rod had ever become acquainted with , and writers were supposed to be intellectual . One of the best things about James Francis was that regardless of how successful a writer he was , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good letter . He wore expensive cashmere jackets and doeskin slacks , and horn-rim glasses , and looked more like a writer than a bank clerk ; but directors and cameramen and highpricedfilm cutters dressed the same way . For a man making the kind of money he made , James Francis Hatter was God damn democratic . And a great sense of humor . He kept the whores laughing for hours at a time , just by the things he said . He was a great guy . And the countess was a bitch , twenty-four karat , to revive those forgotten suspicions . She was something new for Rod . In her taking for granted that he and James Francis were sweethearts she had shown not the slightest bit of surprise or censure . Her only concern was for the Sybil broad , who did not want to get caught with her boy friend . ( They had some divorce law in England which they nicknamedthe Decree Nazi . ) She trusted Rod , because he was a promi/nent film star , but she did not have sense enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he kept thinking about her long after he returned to Hollywood . He was determined that nothing she had said would affect his gratitude and friendship for James Francis ; he saw Jimmy as much as ever . As Rod 's fame expanded and his pictures made more money , there were inevitable changes in their relationship . Publicly , Jimmy became the uncaptioned companion of the big movie star ; in the industry , he was the man you had to talk to if you wanted to get to Rod Fulton ; privately , he was the only person whom Rod could rely on to tell him the truth . Hollywood , after John Barrymore 's memorable performance as Svengali , applied the nickname Trilby to Rod Fulton , but not within his hearing . He had got too big for that ; the only person who could talk that way to Rod Fulton was Svengali Hatter . Moreover , even Hollywood , which enjoyed its moments of sentimentality , was aware that this was a remarkable friendship . It gave the lie to the charge that movie stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the Air Force beat the Marine Corps to it with a firm offer of a captaincy to Rod Fulton . The Navy ran a poor third . There was a certain amount of apprehensivediscussion among the Air Force brass . Jimmy Stewart was a fully qualified peacetime pilot and properly belonged in the Air Force . Clark Gable was not a pilot and had no better education than Rod Fulton , but was given a commission . What then if all three big movie stars got killed ? What would be the effect on military and civilian morale ? It was decided that the chance was worth taking on the theory that as far as service personnel were concerned , movie stars were expendable , and that if all three men got killed , the civilian population would know that we were in a war . Public Relations hoped that if anyonegot killed it would not be Stewart or Gable . They sent Rod on enough missions to qualify him for his Air Medal , and then kept him on the ground . Having visited London before the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he found his way back to the countess . Angela was fatigued by the war , the hazards and the austerity program , and one night Rod Fulton found that he had asked her to marry him and had been accepted . He was never quite sure how it happened ; he had no James Francis in London whom he could turn to for advice , and who could think up a way to get him off the hook . So the marriage took place , with Sybil as matron of honor and Angela 's brother as best man . The union was generally regarded as propitious , a sweeping away of class distinctions and a more than symbolic alliance of two typical representatives of Britainp188and America . Public Relations could not complain about that , and did not . At the earliest opportunity Angela was given a fairly high priority to fly to Los Angeles , there to do splendid work for the Red Cross and the U.S.O. while , in the words of her fellow-Briton Ivor Novello , keepingthe home fires burning . An early visitor was James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cigarettes , and nylons . " I do n't know when I 've had steak , " she said . " You- are a dear , Hatter . " " Yes , ma'am , " he said . " Will there be anything else , ma'am ? " " Why are you imitating a film butler ? That is what you 're doing , is n't it ? " " Very good , ma'am . Yes , it is , you got it , " he said . " Why I guess because I 'm not used to having a woman call me by my last name . " " What shall I call you ? " " Jimmy . Or Mr. Hatter . Or Svengali . Baby , I do n't care what you call me . If you want anything , I 'll try to get it for you . Rod asked me to . But let 's not you and me kid ourselves or each other . " " All right , " said Angela . " In other words , if I need anything , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . I 'm for that . Have you any influence with the airline people ? " " Some . Not as much as the studio transportation department . Why ? " " I know about the studio transportation people . Rod told me . But if I could go to New York next week without having to ask the studio 's help , I 'd be ever so . " " I might be able to fix it , " said James Francis . " And no questions asked ? " " Would I get a truthful answer ? " " This time you might , but I should n't count on it every time , " she said . " It 's rather relaxing not to have to pretend , do n't you find it so ? " " Very . It was my idea . I could n't see putting on an act with you . Life 's too short for that , old girl . " " If I promise not to call you Hatter , will you agree not to call me old girl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm two years older than Rod , if you must know . But I 'm not twenty years older , or ten or even five . On the other hand , I 'm not so young as to not mind being called old girl . I did n't object when you called me baby , although that 's slightly disrespectful as you say it . " " Slightly , " said James Francis.  | " By the way , I know there 's never been anything naughty between you and Rod . You hate me because I thought there had been . But I promise you , it would n't have made the slightest difference to me . " " Well , why should it ? You 've had girl friends , and it wo n't be long before you have some here , judging by the group you latched onto . " " I much prefer boy friends , but Rod would n't take kindly to that . How do you know so much about me , Jimmy ? Rod does n't know that . " " Rod does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Angela . " Maybe he will by the time you get through with him , but I doubt it . " " That may be a long ways off . I adore this climate . " " It can get monotonous . " " Oh , but I hope not , " she said . " I love my England , but there 's not much to be said for our weather . I could soak in this sunshine forever . This is only my third week here , but there 's only a tiny bit of me that 's my original color . Imagine . In February . You 're quite brown , too . You must come and have a swim with me . I wo n't try to seduce you . " " Why not ? " " Well , if you put it that way , I will . Rod told me you were quite a swordsman , and we do n't have to like each other , you know . I do n't suppose you and I ever will like each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the steak , without liking me . I think I 'll sit on your lap . May I ? " " Sure . " " Shall I just close this door so that we wo n't have any untimely interruptions ? " " I was going to suggest that , " said James Francis . " You see , we think alike in some respects . " She got up and turned the latch in the door . On the way back she shed her pajamas . " I know I 'm going to like this , and you are too , " she said . " How much do you think I weigh ? " " Eight stone , " he said . " Extraordinary ! One pound off . And you must be sixteen stone . " " Just about , " he said . " How too perfectly matched we are . You 're very obliging , Jimmy . I was rather hoping this would happen , but you were awfullyp190forbidding at first , with that chip on your shoulder . And now you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself a chippie to Rod . " The frivolity disappeared . " He does n't know anything , does he ? He 's a crashingly dull man . " " The hell with him , baby . " " I say so too , the hell with him , " she said , and stopped talking . Later she said , " Would n't it be better if I went to your house ? Hereafter ? You could never possibly spend the night here . I adored having a quickie with you , but that 's not the real fun , is it ? " " No , and if you lock the sitting-room door you might just as well hang a sign out and tell the servants what you 're doing . My house is much better . A taxi is better than your own car , too . You do n't leave a taxi standing out all night , where everybody can see it . Not to mention gas rationing . " " Do you like me any better ? A smidgeon better ? " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can hardly wait to get into an enormous bed with you . You have one , I 'm sure . " " Yes . " " There 's so much of you  --  and there really is , you know . More than sixteen stone . " " Closer to seventeen . I do n't watch my weight . It always goes up , never goes down . " " Oh , what an opening for a funny . Two funnies . I 'm full of funniestoday . Most likely because Rod told me years ago that you kept the whores laughing with your jokes . It always goes up , never goes down . ' Unlimited possibilities there . Do you adore puns ? My father adored puns , and I was the only other member of the family that did . Adore them . And of course the filthier they are , the more I treasure them . After I was married Daddy felt free to tell me some of the mildly filthy ones . In limericks , mostly . I 've always adored talking dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my school , not for having them but for drawing them . I 've never really had any inhibitions , you know . " " Who were you married to ? " " Oh , a chap . A stinker . Died ten years ago , but he was a stinker . " " How would a guy qualify as a stinker in your book ? " " He ruined my father , or very nearly . Money . He was a stockbroker . The title was n't very old , but old enough to get him his job inp191the City . He persuaded Daddy to buy shares in a mining something or other in Rhodesia . Actually not to buy them but to give him the money to buy them . Never did buy them . Then when he got found out he shot himself , and a fat lot of good that did anyone . Only added to the mess he 'd already created . Oh , he was a stinker . " " Were you in love with him ? " " Was I in love with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . He was much older , and I was much younger . All the naughty things I was curious about were right in his line . He had me get girls for him . That sort of thing . I complied willingly enough . But he sent me to bed with a friend of his and then blackmailed him . Threatened to divorce me and name his friend , which would have been fatal to his friend 's career . Then for the first time I realized that it was n't all fun and games . If you ever want to write a scenario about a real stinker , I can supply you with quantities of material . Quantities of it . Piled high and very malodorous . " " They might have trouble with the casting . " " I quite see what you mean . " " And the last picture I worked on was for Nelson Eddy . Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald . " " I rather think she 'd balk at playing me . Have you ever spoken to her ? Had conversation with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she speak , or does she sing ? Lalalala lala . How do you do do do ? " " Not a bad dame , " said James Francis . " Not the worst in this town . " " Who is the worst ? " " You 've met her . She 's in that group you 've latched onto . " " Oh , tell me . Do n't be a stick , " said Angela . " No , you find out for yourself . And you will , " he said . " Indeed I shall . Does everyone know she 's the worst ? " said Angela . " I mean to say , is she someone notorious ? " " No , you would n't call her notorious . As a matter of fact , she has quite a good reputation . " " Quite a good reputation ? Then she 's in the films ? Not one of the wives ? You can tell me that much . " " She 's in the films . " " Ah , then I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house Friday week . Will you be there , by any chance ? "  | " Hell , no . I 'm not a member of that set , " said James Francis . " You 'll find out all about the Hollywood caste system as you go along . " " But you make pots of money . " " For a writer , I do all right . But it is n't all money , in that set . Gene Autry makes more than most of them , but he 's not a member . " " Is that the cowboy that sings ? " " Yes . He sings all the way to the bank , as they say out here . There are a couple of actors in your set that do n't make as much money as I do , and one producer that 's in hock for the rest of his life . No , money 's important , but it is n't the whole story . You 'll find out . " " Would you like to be in that set ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of anything . I 've never turned down one of their invitations . They used to invite me , at the last minute , out of desperation.You know , they 'd go through their lists and see my name . Jimmy Hatter . Fat writer . Single . Salary , twenty-five hundred . Has Tux , will travel . " " Oh , now really ! " " Just about , " he said . " I 'd always go , and we 'd all pretend I went there all the time . But gradually even the last-minute invitations got scarcer and scarcer . " " Do you know why ? " " Yes , I think I do . The women . They want chic , and I was never chic . It 's the only word I can think of to explain it , and who can explain chic ? You knew I did n't have it the first time you met me , that time Rod and I were in London . Rod did n't have it then , either , but he 's acquired it since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that potentially he had it . " " Yes , he had it . The potential . He was so gauche , and he 's frightfullydull , you know . I 'm not sure that it 's chic that he has , and yet I know exactly what you mean . It 's true in London , too . That stinker I was married to had it , loads of it , although he had practically no chin and a figger like a scarecrow 's . In spite of which , girls were mad for him . Just as they 're mad for Rod , who does have a chin and a wedgeshapedfigger . I have another explanation that is n't chic . It 's the thing that goes on in a woman 's mind , or elsewhere , her response when she sees a man , or a woman , or a thing . Does she want to possess it , to have it around , so to speak ? No , I do n't suppose that is a very good explanation . Chic is better . Not quite it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I have it , while much prettier women have n't . That ladies ' luncheon I went to the other day , that got into the papers andp193supplied you with your information about my set  --  Louise Parsons 's column , is n't it ? " " Louella . Yes , that 's where I read it . " " There were four or at most five women that had it , this thing you 're trying to define . And it 's a dead cert that they 'll be my pals . Birds of a feather , you know . Not because we 're all naughty . After all , everyone 's naughty when the door is closed , do n't you agree ? " " Probably . " " Definitely . At all events , I have found my pals and they have found me , and so I propose to stop in this lovely California sunshine . When this ugly war is over , and Rod comes back and takes up his wonderfully lucrative career again , I shall be the one who says what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it that you 're chic , Jimmy . " " Baby , it is n't going to be that easy . " " Easy ? I did n't say it was going to be easy . But you did n't come here with any intention of committing adultery with your best friend 's wife . And I certainly had no intention of seducing you . But these things happen . " " Hollywood is n't going to be a pushover . " " No , but when I go after something , I get it . Rod , for instance . Was n't a woman in London that would have said no to him . But I got him . Two years older , no money to speak of , no steaks or whiskey to lure him with , and he 's never yet told me that he loves me . Nor I him . But here I am . And here we are . Shall I come see you tonight ? " " Sure . " " After the eleven o'clock news . I 'll just pop in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ha ha . The hell I wo n't . Is n't it nice , though , how things have turned out ? " " Damn nice , " said James Francis . " And you must n't have a guilty conscience , Jimmy . I seduced , you , you did n't seduce me . Rod would n't like it either way , but I 'm not going to tell him , and you 're not , certainly . " " It 's an interesting stalemate . " " Now do n't imply that I planned it that way . I did n't . When Rod comes home and starts asking those dreary questions , I 'm not going to mention you at all . If there 's anyone else , I 'll tell him , because I can hardly expect those London bitches to stay away from him , and he 'll have to answer my dreary questions , too . But I 'll keep you out . Of course it occurs to me that he wo n't believe me if I say there was n't anyone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whom would he mind the least ? "  | " He knows you go for girls . " " Oh , brilliant , Jimmy ! Of course . Think of a girl that he had an affair with and still rather likes . Are there any in my set ? " " Oh , yes . " " Be rather fun , you know . Writing and telling him that I 'm seeinga lot of Susie Ramsbottom , his old girl friend , and then having him force the admission out of me that , yes , Susie and I did have a little , tiny whatchamacallit . He wo n't believe it was a little-tiny , but he 'd rather believe that than have me tell him about some man . " " You know , Angela , I think you must be the worst woman I ever knew . " She paused in the midst of lighting a cigarette . " That would be more of a distinction if I knew more about your women . I only know about your whores , and they were paid for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whores . " She shook the matchstick long after the flame had gone out . " I 'd also have to know who you considered the best woman you 've ever known . Your mother , no doubt . " " My mother was somewhere in between the worst and the best . She had the morals of a reformed hooker . A whore that got religion late in life , but went right on stealing junk off the counters in the five-and-dime . " " Your mother was actually a whore ? " " No , I did n't say that . My father was a linotyper , a printer in a newspaper plant in Chicago and elsewhere . My mother was a bookkeeper . She was married once before she married my father , and her first husband died . My old man was a periodic drunk , but he made pretty good money when he was working . Men used to come to the house when my old gent was on a toot , and I 've always assumed that she was putting out . Laying them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe the old boy got drunk because she was putting out . That I do n't know either . But they sent me to college for two years , and during my second year she went back to the Catholic Church . My old man was n't a Catholic and I never was , but she was brought up one . The old man died , and she went back to work , and I quit college and got a job as a reporter . She earned her own living and I earned mine . She used to try to get me to turn Catholic , but I did n't want any of that . She was at me all the time , trying to convert me , until finally I had to move out . " Her interest was diminishing . " Then she was n't the best womanp195you 've ever known nor yet among the worst , down here with me . Is it sex things that make a woman naughty ? " " Not always , but often . " " But it 's what you had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were n't you thinking that I have no morals ? " " Well , have you ? " " Yes , oddly enough I have . But not where sex is concerned . We have this business between our legs  --  you have yours , and I have mine  --  and obviously they were intended to fit together . Animals and Eskimosare born knowing that . But I 've never considered myself an animal , or an Eskimo . I 've always enjoyed tinkering with other people and letting them tinker with me , for pleasure . What does it matter if you get the pleasure from a man or a woman ? Who said it has to be one way and not the other ? A woman tinkering with another woman is not going to produce a child , nor a man tinkering with another man . But you see I believe that this thing is so strong within us that procreationis only a small part of the story . I produced one child . I never knew for certain whether it came from my husband or someone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it since it was two years old . It was n't something you 'd proudly display to the uncles and aunts . It died in a nursing home when it was eleven . I of course had jolly well seen to it that I 'd never have another . But I 'm not any worse off than a great many of my friends who 've produced healthy , so-called normaloffspring . Some of them turned out to be little stinkers . Some were killed in the war . And all of them were demanding , selfish , and rather ungrateful , even those with the good manners to pretend otherwise . I suppose all this adds fuel to your fire , your belief that I 'm the worst woman you 've ever known . If it does , I assure you I could n't care less . " " That I 'm sure of , " said James Francis . " What shocked you was my flight of fancy concerning Susie Ramsbottom . That I could be so  --  calculating . No more calculating than I was in marrying Rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pajamas and sat on your lap , though you may find that hard to believe . That was impulse , and being hard up . However , you could be forgiven for suspecting me of something else . Whatever I may have had in mind , you and I have cuckolded Mr. Fulton , and you 're far more likely to feel guilty about it than I. My only suggestion is that as you 're going to feel guilty anyhow , you might as well hang yourself for a sheep as a goat . You and I may as well keep the home fires burning till our boy comes home . Agreed ? "  | " I 've already agreed . You 're coming to my house at eleven . " " After the news broadcast , " she said . " Do n't try to lock me out . I 'll climb in through a window . " Major Rod Fulton 's predicted inquisition did no harm to his pride . " You probably knew this , " he said to James Francis . " But you know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them got talking about me one time , and before they knew it they were in the hay together . All the time I was banging Mellie I never knew there was any dike there . Did you ? " " How would I know ? " said James Francis . " I do n't move in that set . " It 's a funny thing now , to go to dinner at Mellie 's and look at her and Angela , putting on this act as if they were like two Pasadena housewives . " " I do n't even move in that set  --  the Pasadena housewives . Or the Santa Ana housewives . Do n't complain . You 're lucky she did n't fall for some filling-station attendant . " " Complain ? Who 's complaining ? I just think it 's funny . I could n't complain . There was plenty of gash in London , and I admitted that I got some of it , but I did n't tell her how much . Do you remember me telling you about one named Sybil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " She was my Number i Priority . I went up in the world , from a countess to a duchess . " " Well , you went in as a captain and came out a major . You were entitled to a promotion . " " Yeah , son of a bitch I got browned off on that . I thought I should have got bird-colonel . I think of some of these bastards that rank me . Not even lieutenant-colonel . Major . Wait till they want something from me . " " Did you get into any trouble ? Is that why ? " " Well  --  there was a buck general after Sybil . He did n't help me any , I guess , " said Rod . " He as much as told me that the R.A.F. boys were taking a deem veeiew of the duchess and I. And I said to him , General , is it the R.A.F. or something closer to home ? ' Meaning him , of course . He got it . And I got my travel orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siberia . So I came out a major . I must owe you a pisspotful of dough . " " Not a nickel . " " I mean for all that black-market stuff . Angela says you reallyp197took care of her  --  in a nice way , of course . Steaks , nylons , and butter and all . " " It came to exactly seventy-five thousand eight hundred and twenty-four dollars and fifteen cents . " " No , seriously , Jimmy . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " said James Francis . " It 'd be funny if Mellie Waltham got some of those nylons . " " I hope not , " said James Francis . " She has a nice pair of gams , " said Rod . " Well , now it 's back to the old grind . And you know who 's going to be in my first picture ? If you do n't know , you can guess . " " Miss Melina Waltham . " " You knew ? " " No , I guessed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real acting wo n't get on film . It 'll be Mellie and I between takes . " " Why kid around ? It 'll come out the first time you give her a jump . " " I was n't sure I would give her a jump . " " Now you 're kidding yourself . " " Maybe you 're right . You usually are . " " It does n't take much to be right about you and Mellie . " " Jimmy , I think you knew she was a dike and you knew it all along . " " As far as I 'm concerned , personally , she 's a virgin . If she ever wants to prove otherwise , you can give her my number . Whatever she is , it 's nice pussy , and you 're not going to pass that up . " " When you think of it , why should I ? We 're gon na be three weeks in the High Sierras , and Angela wants to go to Palm Springs . She 's nuts about that sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not either , if I do n't have to . Korda wants me for a picture there , but the studio wants me to do at least three for them before they loan me out . Did you know I was big in England ? " " Sure , did n't you ? " " Oh , not like when we were there . I mean really big . " " How are you in Northern Ireland ? " " You son of a bitch , the same old Jimmy . I tell you , guy , it 's good to be back , " said Rod . " Wuddia say you come up to the High Sierras with me ? You can just fart around , do some writing . Maybe make a score with Mellie . " " No , I was thinking of going to the desert . "  | " The Springs ? " " Or Indio . Twenty-nine Palms . It 'll probably be The Springs . The Racquet Club and the Chee-Chee Bar . I 'm a creature of habit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as Angela 's going to be there ? " " Oh , she 's probably seen enough of me to last her for a while . " " Nuts . She 's thinking of taking Ed and Mary Veloz 's house . There 'd be plenty of room for you , and you 'd save a few bob on the rent . " " A few what ? " " A few bob . All right , that 's limey talk . Anyway , that 'd be a good chance for me to pay you back for some of those steaks and stuff . " " You 'd better talk to Angela first . " " All right , I will , " said Rod . In due course Rod departed for the High Sierras , and Angela and James Francis settled down in the Veloz house in Palm Springs . " I 'm beginning to think you 're married to the All-American chump , " said James Francis . " I never thought otherwise , " said Angela . " And this is the end , the living end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mellie promised to let me know the moment he comes creeping into her tent . " " You should see that tent . It 's what you English call a caravan . Electric lights . Shower . Flush can . All the comforts of home . Rod gets one , too . They 'll use his , because her maid sleeps in hers . " " There 's nothing her maid does n't know about her , " said Angela . " I sometimes wonder about all this . Do you ? " " Yes , I do . We 're all outsmarting each other , and the pay-off has to come sooner or later , " said James Francis . " In some form or another . Is that what you meant ? " " Yes . I adore this life  --  the sunshine , and never having to worry about money and so on . But lately I 've begun to realize how difficult life was before I married the film star . There was always something , you know . Money . My father growing feeble-minded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . My child . The bloody war . But here I have nothing to worry about . " " Then do n't worry . " " It is n't as easy as all that . The English weather makes us appreciatea few sunny days . By the same token , my troubles made me enjoy my fun . You see what I mean , of course ? "  | " I see that you 're a restless dame that always will be restless , " he said . " I adore having you as my lover . But if I should bring home one of those tennis players , you would n't mind a bit . " " Are you thinking of bringing home one of the tennis players ? " " I did , yesterday . I was n't going to tell you , but it belongs in this conversation . " " While I was playing dominoes at the club , " said James Francis . " I 'll never have him here again . I 'll never have him again . He was crude . And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty-four dollars out of my purse . " " I 'm not sure which made you sore . The crudeness or the theft . " " Both . I 've never had to actually pay money , you know . If anything , it 's been the other way round . I 've been given some awfully nice presents in my time . But this creature expected me to reward him . He put on his flannels and his blazer . I was still lying in bed . He picked up my purse and reached inside it and said , I ' 11 just take this , lady . I 'll be back next weekend , if you care to look me up . ' Then it began to dawn on me that he 'd always expected to be paid , and that at last I was one of those women . That if I 'd been ugly and fat and unattractive , he 'd still have come home with me . A gigolo in a Wimbledon blazer is a gigolo nonetheless . And a woman that he expects payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those women , Jimmy ? Have I reached that stage ? " " He 's about twenty-two or - three , and you obviously picked him up . " We 'd been introduced , quite properly introduced . He should have known that I was n't one of those women . I was much the most attractive lady at the club . You always tell Rod the truth  --  " " Not always . " " You know what I mean . You 're candid with him . Be candid with me . We 're friends . " " What is there to be candid about , Angela ? You know how old you are . You got hot pants for a tall young kid that you 'd been watchingplaying tennis , where he 's at his best . You invited him here , and both of you knew what you wanted him for . He must be used to that by this time , and if you 're over twenty-five , he expects to get paid in some way or another . At least you got off without promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely affair with an Italian tennis player . Davis Cup . Years ago . This creature yesterday had never heard of him . "  | " There you are , " said James Francis . " But you ? You 're not cross with me ? " " If you mean , am I jealous ? No . Would you be jealous if I brought someone home with me ? " " No . Yes ! If you brought her here , yes . Unless you were bringing her here for both of us . " " That 's different , " said James Francis . " I am a little cross with you , though . This quick lay with your tennis player may get back to Rod , and if it does he 's going to be sore at me and you . " " Why ? " ? " Because he 's gotten really big , especially in the head , and out here he 's royalty . He 's not going to like having his princess get in the sack with a lowly tennis player . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why will he be cross with you ? " " Because I 'm here to keep an eye on you . I am your duenna , while he 's up there screwing Mellie Waltham , getting even with you and her for cheating on him during the war . " " He did n't mind that a bit . It rather amused him . " " That 's what you think . That head has gotten so big that he wants to run all our lives . " " We could shrink that head , you and I. Shall we ? " " I do n't want to . He 'd be so bewildered if we told him about us , when he finally got around to believing it he 'd be left with nothing . Nothing . " " You really love him , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do . " " Why ? Is it something in him , or something in you ? " " In me , I guess . When I first knew him he was pathetic , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . Whatever he has , I saw it in him , and I was the first to see it . I 've never been an envious man , not even of other writers . I know my limitations there . I 'm not as good a writer as Hemingway , but I doubt if year in and year out he makes as much money as I do , and your own Dr. Johnson said that a writer who did n't write for money was a damn fool , or words to that effect . I 'm doing all right . Whenever I 'm tempted to worry about the future , I tell myself that this is the future . I make so much money writing for pictures that I actually ca n't afford to write any more SaturdayEvening Post stories . " " But your future that is n't writing  --  what about that ? "  | " I have none . One of these days the ticker will give out . Rich food , and booze , and mattress calisthenics  --  " " Mattress caliswhat ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When that happens , I 'll give up writing and devote my remainingenergy to loose living . At present , half of my energy goes into my work . But once I 've had a stroke or something like that , I 'll just keep sticking my finger down my throat , and some morning I wo n't wake up . " " I 've never really , really thought of doing away with myself . " " Well , you have something to live for , " said James Francis . " Oh ? What ? " " Pleasure . All-out , selfish pleasure , " he said . " Yes . I never thought of it that way , but it 's quite true . " " Do n't weaken , just because some jerk tennis player wounded your pride . You 've been honest with yourself so far . You 've never given much of a thought to anyone else . I 'd hate to think you were going to spoil that record just because you 're afraid of getting old . Some people do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do n't you . " " Are you being sardonic ? " " Not a bit , " said James Francis . " What you say about me is perfectly true , but it sounds so awful when put into words . " " I 've known some women in their sixties that still get a great kick out of being wicked . " " I 'm not wicked . I 'm naughty , but not wicked . " " You can graduate to wicked . " " A wicked old woman . I 'm not so sure I 'd care to be that . What do they do ? " " Nothing very different from what they 've always done , but the fact that they 're doing it at sixty-five makes it wicked and therefore exciting . All their contemporaries are behaving like professional grandmothers , but they still get a bang out of seducing a willing bellboy . " Or a tennis player . " " Or a tennis player . Or a young doctor . Or a clergyman . If they ca n't do it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with candy for the neighbors ' children . " " Were you ever given candy by a wicked old woman ? " " I was n't , but one of my chums was . He not only got the candy , but he used to tell me how the old lady made him feel good . "  | " Oh , yes , " said Angela . " We had some of that at home , come to think of it . " " I 'm sure it was n't confined to my neighborhood in Chicago . " " And so you suggest that I save the little boys for my old age ? " " If that happens to please you . Mind you , it does n't have to be sex . Some of them abandon sex for other pastimes . As in the case of my mother trying to convert me to her religion . Or those old women who louse up their children 's marriages . Or go around bullying people by threatening to leave them out of their wills . " " But in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's where you 've operated mostly , " said James Francis . " It has been my speciality . " " Why do you say speciality ? The word is specialty . " " No , the word is speciality . Specialite . I refer you to the French . " " You know , you 're kind of wonderful . You 're practically illiterate , but you 'll argue with a writer over the pronunciation of a word . The arrogance . I 'm not going to worry much about you . " " It just happens that I was right and you were wrong . " " There 's something else about you . A couple of times in my life I 've lived with various dames . Shacked up with them for fairly long periods of time . But those ersatz marriages  --  to put it another way , I 've come closer to the real thing with you than with anyone else in my whole life . " " That 's rather nice . I like you , too . You 're not like anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely trust you , and that 's a new experience for me . Even my father , sweet as he was , was rather ineffectual and not the tower of strength one hopes a father will be . He never cared much what I did , and you do . You tell me to go on being naughty , and give little boys candy to let me tinker with them . But that 's you showing off , to prove to me how frightfully sophisticatedyou are . Actually , you 're as sound as the Bank of England , and what I like is that you make me feel warm . Comfy . Protected . Are you by nature protective , Jimmy ? You were with Rod , and now you are with me . I like it , and I 've never known it before . Some night you may roll over on me and squash me to death , but with my dying breath I 'll forgive you because I 'll know you could never be cruel . It 's the blind cruelty of men that I like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My other stinker of a husband . But never you . I really love you , and I almost wish I could say it without saying really . "  | " I know that , " said James Francis . " I 'd do anything for you , baby . " They were impulsively silent , the busyness of their thoughts for once dominated by the nearness of an emotion . " Odd that we have n't heard anything from the High High Sierras , " she said . " The High C 's in the High Sierras . What made me think of that was Miss Waltham . At certain moments of ecstasy she hits high-C . She 's a noisy piece . Rather common . " " Common to you and your husband , at least . " " Oh , shut up , " she said . " Mind your manners , " he said . " What do you want to do tonight ? Do you want some Chinese food ? And then the Chee-Chee Bar ? " " Yes , let 's be out when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . She 'll be dying to break the news to me , and I think I 'd like to take some of the fun out of it for her . " " He 's getting under your skin , baby . " " Yes , as dear Cole Porter says , Do n't you know , you fool , you never can win . ' " " I will take you out and get you slightly intoxicated . " " And when we come home I 'll turn off the telephone , and sleep , sleep , sleep . Do n't let me take any cognac . My heart thumps and keeps me awake . I 've never really cared for spirits . My saving grace , that I never became a dipso . I may get tight as a nun 's cunt on wine , but do n't make me have those liqueurs with you . " " All right , " he said . " Anything you say . " " Dear man , " she said . " Dear friend Jimmy . " " Whom you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't quite the same , is it ? If I say , -I really love you , ' it means not quite . But if I say , Whom I really love , ' it means very nearly . " " And the French say specialite . Go take your bath , baby . Let 's be ready in an hour , " he said . " I have to eat an awful lot of Chinese food before the temple bells start ringing . " " The temple  --  " " Before my stomach gets the message , " said James Francis . They returned from their night out shortly after one o'clock in the morning . " What time is it in the High-C Sierras ? " said Angela . " The same as here . Same time zone . But they 'll have gone to bed hours ago , separately or together . They have to get up at half pastp204four or five . We wo n't be hearing from them tonight , but I advise you to turn your phone off anyhow . They might decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you feel ? " " Terribly sleepy . Not a bit tight , but terribly sleepy . " " Well , then I 'll not foist my attentions on you , " he said . " I do n't think I 'd be much good , " she said . " I could use the sleep , too , " said James Francis . She was taking off her rings and bracelets as she spoke , and she opened the dressing-table drawer . " Someone 's been here ! " she said . " My jewel box is empty ! " " Uh-oh . What did they take ? " " I know exactly . The best things are at home , thank heaven . But my star sapphire 's gone . My star sapphire . Gold wristwatch . A little pearl necklace . Five or six gold pins , costume jewelry . My small gold cigarette case that holds six . That sunburst I wear with a beret . " " Not exactly junk . What was the star sapphire worth ? " " For insurance purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say six thousand dollars . Wristwatch ? " " Oh  --  probably a thousand dollars . The pins were worth at least a hundred apiece , dollars . The cigarette case ca n't be replaced . It once belonged to a grand duke and had his crest on it . I adored it . I bought it from a man in the Ritz Bar , in Paris . At least it was bought for me . Actually it was bought for Sybil , and she gave it to me for my birthday . How infuriating ! Were n't we told that we did n't have to lock up ? " " Yes , but you do n't leave ten thousand dollars ' worth of jewelry lying around , " said James Francis . " You make a list , and I 'll call the cops . " " Do we want to do that ? Call the police ? " " If you ever want to get any of it back . " " You know , of course , who I suspect , " she said . " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retake with you , and when you were n't here , he helped himself . " " At least he did n't find me too repulsive , did he ? " " Always look on the bright side , Angela . That 's my girl . I suggestthat we call the cops right now and lay it on the line with them . " " Tell them who we suspect ? " " Yes . This town does n't like bad publicity , and if you play ball with them , they 'll play ball with you . " " It 's on your head , " said Angela . " I wash my hands of it.  |p205Frankly  , I think you 'll be making a most awful mistake , but I 'm a foreigner here . " The police car arrived in ten minutes . James Francis greeted the two patrolmen , identified himself and Angela , and gave an account of the burglary as he knew it . The sergeant , a man named Wittenberg , had dealt with Hollywood people before , but James Francis , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's the situation , Sergeant , " he said . " Mrs. Fulton rented the house from Mr. and Mrs. Edmund Veloz  --  " " We know that , all right , " said Wittenberg . " They 're great friends of Mr. and Mrs. Fulton . " " We know that , too . Mr. Veloz told us all that , " said Wittenberg . " And we know who you are , too , Mr. Hatter . " " Good . Now I 'm going to level with you , because Mrs. Fulton is a foreigner . English . The wife of my best friend . She has n't been over here very long , and her husband would want me to go to bat for her , so to speak . Yesterday she was followed home from the tennis club by a young fellow named Glenn Slaymaker  --  " " The tennis player , " said Wittenberg . " Right , " said James Francis . " Apparently Mrs. Fulton had said to him something about coming to see her sometime , in a polite Englishway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came home and five minutes later , Mr. Glenn Slaymaker appeared , and made some advancesto Mrs. Fulton . She repulsed him and sent him on his way , but before he left he helped himself to all her cash , amounting to over two hundred dollars . He made no bones about it . He opened her purse and took out the money . She of course was only too glad to get rid of him . As you can see , Mrs. Fulton would be no match for Slaymaker in a real struggle , and two hundred dollars was a small price to pay , possiblyfor her life . She was still nervous and overwrought when I came home , and I had a hard time getting the whole story out of her . Naturally , I wanted to notify the police immediately , but Mrs. Fulton did n't want any publicity that might adversely affect her husband . She had n't been harmed physically , and it was only a couple of hundred dollars . " " Sure , " said Wittenberg . " However , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that Slaymaker told Mrs. Fulton that he was going away , but that he 'd be back next week , and told her or threatened her with anothervisit . That 's interesting to me , because he wanted her to think hep206would n't be here last night . In other words , my theory is  --  for what it 's worth  --  Slaymaker was preparing a sort of alibi . " " Yeah , that could be , " said Wittenberg . " At the same time , warning her that he was coming back . " " Uh-huh . " " Now of course all this is pure speculation on my part . It may be absolutely worthless if it turns out that Slaymaker did go away , and did n't steal this jewelry . But he 's my prime suspect . " " Use your phone ? " said Wittenberg . " Go right ahead , " said James Francis . " This one , or there are others if you 'd rather . " " This 'll be all right , " said Wittenberg . He dialed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Wittenberg , out at the Veloz house on that burglary . Find out if Glenn Slaymaker , the tennis player , is anywhere around . I just want to make sure if he 's in town . No , do n't pick him up just yet . I 'll be back to you in ten minutes . Okay , Norm . Over . " " Could we offer you gentlemen a cup of coffee ? " said James Francis . " No thanks , " said Wittenberg . " Itta been better if you notified us when he took that money yesterday . Guys like that , you know , they count on people being afraid of publicity . If we picked him up yesterday , he probably would of told an altogether different story . Like inferringthat Mrs. Fulton gave him the money , and did n't force his attentions on her . We 'd like to put this fellow away for a while , but if we do n't get the right cooperation there is n't much we can do . " " You have a sheet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't have a sheet on him . Well , we have a sheet on him , but it 's unofficial . Not even an arrest . Were you ever a cop ? " " No , but I was a police reporter , back East . " " Oh . Well , if we could hit him with a grand-theft rap , we could put him away for a while . His kind of a guy will go right on as long as you people let him get away with it . " " Only too true , " said James Francis . " But you know what the press would make of this . And there 's that other angle . The Palm Springs angle . " " What angle is that , Mr. Hatter ? " said Wittenberg . " Oh  --  I 've been coming here a long time , so I know a little bit about The Springs . How they do n't like to have any bad publicity any more than a big star like Rod Fulton . The motion picture industry has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very beginning . Looking at it realistically , it 's always been a case of youp207scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours . You know what I mean , Ser-geant . " " Yeah , but I 'd still like to put that fellow away for a while . We wo n't have any trouble getting him to leave town . But I 'd like to see him in Q. " " The sergeant is referring to San Quentin . That 's one of our prisons , " said James Francis . " Well , I 'll tell you , Sergeant . Both Mr. and Mrs. Rod Fulton usually listen to my advice . If you hang it on this guy Slaymaker , so that you have a real open-and-shut case against him , I 'll advise Mrs. Fulton to cooperate completely . All you care about is sending him away . You do n't care whether he cops a plea or not , do you ? " " He 'll get a shorter sentence that way . " " What do you care , and what does Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , it 's not going to make any difference to you or to Palm Springs if he goes away for a year or five years . He 'll be marked as a jailbird , and he wo n't be coming around here again . " " Well , we may be jumping pretty far ahead . We 're not sure he did it . " " No , you could n't go into court with what you know now . But as man to man , as an experienced police officer to an old-time reporter , I 'll bet that 's the way it turns out . Slaymaker 's your man . " " I 'm inclined to think so , but I 'm a cop , not a lawyer . " " Bring him in for questioning . You 'll know inside of ten minutes whether he did it or not . Just forget about the legal technicalities . Go by your experience with criminals . I think this guy 'll scare pretty easily , too . He 's used to frightening women , but he has n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Wittenberg . " Mrs. Fulton , we 'll want a detailed description of the stolen articles . The more detailed the better , like if you can give us little sketches of the design . Where the stuff came from . Any initials or other engraving . " " I should be delighted , " said Angela . She was back at being a countess , on the side of law and order and gentility . She gave a performancethat could not have been imitated by a mere actress . The cops , James Francis could see , were impressed . " There we are , Sergeant , " said Angela when she had completed her list . " The money value may be high on some and low on others . The sapphire ring is the most valuable single piece , and the cigarette case has the greatest sentimentalvalue . It once belonged to a grand duke , who was assassinatedin the Revolution . It was given me by a friend of his . Actuallyp208she was a cousin , not a friend . I never knew the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the war together . " " Yes , ma'am , " said Wittenberg . " Well , I hope we get it back for you , and the other articles . The drawings will be a lot of help . " " Thank you . You sound as if you went in for sketching . Do you ? " " Well , not any more , but I used to , " said Wittenberg . " You folks wo n't be hearing any more from us tonight , but I 'll call you first thing in the morning if we have anything . " The cops departed . " Another five minutes and you 'd have had his fly open , " said James Francis . " Less than that , if you had n't been here . You and the other policeman . Actually , I did n't flirt with him . I was being my most gardenparty-and-parasol , slightly unbending . " " You gave a performance worthy of Norma Shearer , with a touch of Dame May Whitty . Knowing something about police procedure , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So for the next few days do n't walk around without any clothes on . " " Thank you for taking charge , Jimmy . You were marvelous , really you were . " " We were both pretty good . That crap about the grand duke 's cigarette case , that convinced the sergeant that he was n't dealing with some Hollywood broad . " " I had to convince him that anything Slaymaker told him was a lie . About me , that is . " " He was partly convinced by the fact that I phoned him right away . If you 'd have been afraid of what Slaymaker 'd say , you would n't have let me phone . And that 's why I phoned . It 's Slaymaker'sword against yours , and they wo n't want to believe Slaymaker . If he had any sense he 'd be in Tia Juana by now , but I 'll bet you he 's still in Palm Springs . He 's greedy . " " Do you think he might come back here ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Quentin . " " Why would he come back here ? He 's taken all the jewelry I have with me . " " He did n't take what you wore tonight . That ring is worth more than all the rest of the stuff put together . " " Rod 's wedding present , " she said . " Yes , that 's much the most valuable thing I own . I know he paid ten thousand guineas for it . I 'm never without it . "  | " And charm-boy saw it yesterday , " said James Francis . He got up and wandered about , opening and closing drawers . He left the room and came back with a snub-nosed revolver in his hand . " This is what I was looking for . I was sure Ed Veloz would have one some-where . " " Please put it away . I hate them . " " Listen , I do n't want to tangle with a trained athlete . Slaymaker would knock me out cold with one punch . " " But you said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be , but just in case , " said James Francis . " Do you know how to shoot it ? " " Christ , yes . I 'm not Dead-Eye Dick , but I 've fired plenty of them . " " Then please put it away , Jimmy . I 'm really most awfully frightenedof them . " " Just forget about it . I 'll keep it in my room . Now you go to bed . Take a sleeping pill , and I 'll see you in the morning . " " I have n't got any . Have you ? " " No , I do n't use them , " said James Francis . " Take a hot bath and I 'll heat you some milk . " " Do you really think he might be back tonight ? " " I 'm not ruling out the possibility , " said James Francis . " If he does come , he wo n't stay when he sees this . As I told the sergeant , Slaymaker is used to threatening women , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope they catch him before he gets here . " " Devoutly , so do I , " said James Francis . She took her warm bath and he brought her a glass of warm milk . " I put a little nutmeg on top , and a teaspoon of sugar . It 'll go down more easily . " " I really love you , Jimmy , " she said . " I know . Really . How many men have put you to bed with a glass of warm milk ? " " Not one . That 's why I really love you , " she said . " Goodnight , baby . " " Are you staying up ? " " For a while . I have all the magazines to catch up on , " he said . He left her as she was slowly sipping the milk , her bedside lampstill burning . He got some magazines from the sitting-room and tookp210them to his bedroom , undressed , propped up some pillows and sat in bed , reading . It was not long before drowsiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his light . In two minutes he was asleep . It was not a sound that made him come awake . He was awake , his eyes open in the dark , and then listening for a sound . But his instinct cautioned him to be as quiet as the quiet house . He reached under his pillow for the .38 , and even the barely audible rustling of his hand on the bedlinen was still the loudest noise in the house . Angela 's room was on the other side of the sitting-room , and he tuned his hearingfor sounds from there . He got out of bed in the dark and in his bare feet . His vision was adjusting to the light in the sky and he began to discern the outlines of furniture . In the sitting-room he paused , and he saw that the light from Angela 's room spilled out onto the turf beside the house . He went out through the sitting-room door and walked on the turf until he was standing just outside the door of Angela 's room . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest ; she was holding the bedclothes neck-high and watching Slaymaker go through a drawerful of lingerie , throwing it piece by piece to the floor . " You 've got everything , I tell you , " she said . " Take the ring and please go . " " I want to know where the other stuff is , " said Slaymaker . " I tell you it 's in Beverly Hills , I swear it . " " Do n't talk so loud , you 'll wake that fag creep , " said Slaymaker . James Francis pushed the door open . " All right , I 'm a fag creep , " he said . " Back up against the wall . Angela , phone the cops . " Slaymaker rushed toward him , and James Francis fired the .38 . Slaymaker was momentarily stopped , but momentum carried him forward and James Francis fired again . This time the impact of the bullet on his chest  --  higher than the first shot  --  knocked Slaymaker back and he fell over . " Jesus , I am Dead-Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the floor , and then the life went out of his eyes . " Never mind , I 'll call the cops , " said James Francis . Angela was weeping and muttering to herself , unintelligibly and childishly , like a little girl who has just been snatched out of the path of a nasty boy on a bike . Sergeant Wittenberg found a .25 automatic in a side pocket of Slaymaker 's blazer , and Angela 's wedding-present ring in the breast pocket . " We were here till about an hour ago , " said Wittenberg . " Then we got a call to the other end of town . Is that your revolver ? " " No , it belongs to Ed Veloz , " said James Francis.  |p2111  " I 'll take it , please , " said Wittenberg . He looked down at Slaymaker'sbody . " He sure takes up a lot of room here , does n't he ? " " He was a big one , all right , " said James Francis . " He had enough stuff stashed away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stuff , Mrs. Fulton , plus a lot of things werereported stolen . His wife came in while our men were having a look . One more day and she 'd have had it over the border . Acapulco . " " He had a wife , eh ? " said James Francis . " And a kid on the way , judging by her appearance . A nice little doll , aged about eighteen maybe . Now the kid gets born in Tehachapi , most likely . I was born in Tehachapi , and my father was a famous tennis player . ' That 's what the kid 'll be saying all its life . Well , we got things to do here . " " Let me brew some coffee , " said Angela . " Yeah , there 'll be no more sleep here the rest of the night , " said Wittenberg . " You know , the worst of it is , he had every opportunity . My kid idolized this bum . Idolized him . " " Can we go back to Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why not , as soon as you get the word from the Riverside County authorities . There wo n't be any charge against you , but they 'll want to know where they can get in touch with you . " " Till the coroner 's jury returns a verdict , as I recall it , " said James Francis . " That 's about it . A couple weeks , then you 're free to go anywhere in the world . " " In line of duty , did you ever have to kill a man ? " " Yes , I did . " " I was just wondering when it would begin to hit me , and how long it stays with you . " " Well , with me it 's different , Mr. Hatter . I have a gun on my hip most of the time . I was a cop six years before I ever fired it at anybody . I winged him . I guess I felt worse about that than the one that died . Ask Merle . Merle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop " " Part of the job , " said the other cop . " It was him or me . Crazy drunken wet-back come at me with a machete . There was his wife lying on the floor with her head half cut off . I gave him five slugs and he still nicked me just below the elbow . Twenty-four stitches . They were afraid I was gon na lose the arm through infection . You know they do n't exactly sterilize those machetes . The arm was out like this . "  | " The second week he was a cop , " said Wittenberg . " It 's part of the job , " said Merle . " With this bum , it was him or you , Mr. Hatter . He had that jealous wife in his pocket . " " Our name for the .25 automatic , " said Wittenberg . " They never seem to miss , either . A little old woman that never had a gun in her hand before , she 'll point it at a guy and get him right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to get out of here , if you do n't mind , " said James Francis . " Let 's go in the other room . " " You stay here , will you , Merle ? " said Wittenberg . He lowered his voice . " You want to be sick , Mr. Hatter ? " " No , I just want to get out of this room . I have a feeling he 's listening to us . Slaymaker . " " Right , " said Wittenberg . " The fellow 'll be here to take the necessary photographs , and then the body can be removed . " " The sooner the better , " said James Francis . " Right , " said Wittenberg . They sat in the sitting-room , and Wittenberglit a cigarette , first offering his pack to James Francis . " You did n't know Slaymaker , did you ? " " Only to see . I watched him play tennis a few times . He was good . Jesus ! Now it 's beginning to get me . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , and now he never will again . Thanks to me . " " Wait a minute . Thanks to himself . Think of how many women he was blackmailing . You do n't know it , but there 's going to be plenty of them will heave a sigh of relief when they read the papers today . All over the country . Over in Europe , too . Mexico . This bum started a long time ago . First with a prominent business man in L.A. , till the older guy had a stroke . Slaymaker was around seventeen then . Then there was a movie actress that I wo n't mention her name . You 'd probablyknow her . But you see none of these people would ever sign a complaint . That 's the kind of people he always picked on . He had a regular gift for  --  oh , thanks very much , Mrs. Fulton . Just sugar , no cream , thanks . Hard to get used to having sugar whenever you want it . " " Did you have any sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It could n't have been much . Sergeant , do n't you think Mr. Hatterought to get some more sleep before  --  ca n't you order him to rest before they all descend upon us ? The press , and the authorities and so on ? "  | " Well , he looks pretty peak-ed , but I ca n't order him to do anything . Our people will be here any minute , and then maybe you could go to some friend 's house . Those reporters 'll track you down , that 's for sure , but if you had some friend 's house you could go to , that 'd be all right with us . " " I say let 's get it over with and then I 'll call the studio and they 'll do what they can for you , Angela . The old Hollywood slogan . The studio can do anything . I 'm free-lancing at the moment , but I have my car and I know my way around . " Thus , eventually , it was arranged . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel room under an alias . James Francis left his own car at the Veloz house and rented a Chevrolet . He eluded the reporters and established his temporary headquarters in the bordello on Crescent Heights Boulevard . The madam was out shopping when he got there , but the colored maid let him in . " Early in the day for you , Mr. Hatter , " said the maid . " Miss Bonnie is over to the Farmers Market , and all the girls is either asleep or out . " " That 's all right , Lily . All I want now is a room with a tele-phone . " " With a telephone ? Let me think . Yes sir , I guess Room 9 there 's a phone in there . " " Did n't you hear about me , Lily ? I 'm hot . " " There 's something I should hear about you , Mr. Hatter ? I do n't only seldom read the nespapers , and my little radio is on the blink . Wud you do now , Mr. Hatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Francis . " That 's serious  --  if you 're serious . You done killed one , for sure ? You always kidding around . " " Do n't worry , Lily . I 'm not really hot , but I do n't want to be bothered with newspaper reporters . " " Then you come to the right place , that 's for sure . I take you up to Room 9 . You care for liquid refreshment ? A sandwich ? " " If you have any cold beer , and a ham sandwich , maybe . Anythingyou can rustle up . I 'll leave it to you . " Now began a couple of hours of revelation and frustration , unlikeany he had ever known . He telephoned eight men  --  other writers , a producer friend , a saloonkeeper , his agent . The agent was playing golf . All the others wanted to talk about the shooting in Palm Springs . But not one of them would offer or even agree to put him up for a few days . Each of them had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one would stretch a point for him . " Every son of a bitch I called owes me a favor , " he said to the madam on her return . " I 'm just as hot as if I were guilty of a crime . " " I do n't know , Jimmy , " said Bonnie . " I just do n't know . " " What do n't you know ? " " Well , anybody gets in a jam  --  " " But who 's in a jam ? Did n't you see the papers ? I 'm not a lammister . I was n't even put under technical arrest . The cops actually helped me dodge the newspaper guys . " " I read all the papers and I been listening to the radio . The guy you shot was a bum , that 's for sure . He never come in here , but you hear talk . All the same , though , Jimmy , I kind of understand what they 're all thinking . " " Do you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . You can stay . You can do me a favor . Tonight , when the customers start dropping in , I just as soon you did n't sit around the bar . You can stay a week if you feel like it , but they come here for a good time , you know . You ought to know . " " Oh , big deal . Big deal . How much do I owe you for the use of the room and the phone calls ? " " I would n't charge you if you stayed a week . I 'd let you stay if you were hot . All I 'm asking is if you keep out of the bar , that 's all . " " My home away from home , " said James Francis . " They were all local calls , so maybe I owe you a buck for the telephone . Two bottles of beer , that 's two bucks . The sandwich , another two bucks . The use of the room , I do n't know how to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you figure it , Bonnie ? I never came out of here for under fifty bucks , but this time you and Lily were the only females I talked to . Here 's twenty bucks . " " I wo n't take your money . I only asked you one small favor and right away you get a fig up your rear end . " " Yes , I have a fig up my rear end . I should n't have come here in the first place . But I promise you this , Bonnie . I 'll never set foot in your palace of joy again . The years I 've been coming here I probably blew around fifty gees , but that , as they say , is water under the bridge . " He dropped a twenty-dollar bill on the table and left the house . He drove out to the Strip , up the hill to the vicinity of his house . But from a block away he saw a small group of bored men and women ,  |p215some  of them with camera kits slung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . He continued on his way , without being sure what that was . He was a marked man , and the mark was Cain 's . It was often said in later years that Rod Fulton , whether you liked him or not , had stood by James Francis Hatter when Jimmy got in that jam in Palm Springs . That was the jam where Jimmy Hatter shot and killed a guy . There were a lot of stories at the time about how Jimmy happened to shoot him . The official version , of course , was that the guy was a thief , who had come to steal some jewelry from Rod Fulton 's wife , the former English countess that Rod was then married to . Angela Somebody . Rod divorced her a couple of years later , and there were a lot of stories about that , too . She went completelyLesbo , according to one story , and Rod gave her a bundle and sent her back to England . There was another version that she had been banging the guy that stole the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of which Jimmy shot him . There were all sorts of rumors and the story never did get straightened out . One of the cops on the case ended up as the head of the security department at Rod 's studio . Fellow named Wittenberg . Well liked . The other cop on the case , Merle Billings , was murdered in cold blood by his own wife , who shot him with a .25 automatic . The only reason people remembered that was because the wife 's defense was said to have been based on her insane jealousy of Angela Fulton , but there was no testimony to that effect in court . If anybody should have been jealous of Angela Fulton , according to the Palm Springs gossip , it was Mrs. Wittenberg . After Rod Fulton married Melina Waltham , and they became the first husband-and-wife team to win the Academy Award as costarsin the same picture , Rod really settled down to serious acting . There was that one bomb , in which he played Plato , but he and Melinaappeared in a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch in The Valley , where they gave Sunday night readings of Shakespeareand Moliere and Sheridan , and what-not , for a few invited friends who shared their intense interest in the drama . They were coached by Olga Chapman-Lang , formerly of the Royal Academy , who was a close friend of Melina Waltham 's . Their ultimate aim was a New York production of Macbeth , which was announced prematurelyand , of course , canceled forever by the tragic death of Melinap216by lung cancer . Rod was inconsolable . He asked for , and obtained , the postponement of the film he had hoped to do with Melina and which , they both knew , was to be their last co-starring vehicle . He had seen very little of James Francis Hatter during his marriage to Melina . Olga Chapman-Lang had been frank to say that she considered Hatter a gross voluptuary , whose influence on Rod was disruptive and destructive to his serious preparations for the next phase of his career . " We can not work , we can not think , when that man is near , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away or I can not go on working with you . He has no respect for anything he does not understand . " As she had a strong ally in Melina Waltham , her wish prevailed ; James Francis was not invited to the Rod Fulton house until after Melina 's death . But he came as soon as he was asked , and Olga Chapman-Lang was seen no more at the Fulton ranch . " How about going away with me for a while ? " said Rod . " Where to ? " said James Francis . " Up to Oregon , for the steelheads . I 'll have to buy all new tackle . I gave mine all away . " " I ca n't do it , Rod , " said James Francis . " No more roughing it for me . The old bones wo n't take it . " " Then let 's go someplace else , just so we get out of here . " " Well , we could take an apartment in New York , and you could let the word get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 'd be no more different than staying here , " said Rod . " Have you given up the idea of conquering the legitimate ? " " You know something ? I would n't walk out in front of a Broadwayaudience for a million dollars cash . Those critics would tear meto pieces . " " Yes , in Shakespeare they would . You and Mellie . But you were safe . That Chapman-Lang dike knew better than to let you play Macbeth . She had a good thing going for her as long as you did your acting in the back yard . " " I used to wonder about that , but Mellie had her heart set on it . Olga had us both hypnotized . Mesmerized . Something . " " She sure did , " said James Francis . " To convince Mellie Walthamthat she could play Lady Macbeth . One of the greatest con acts I ever saw . Mellie , with her cute little nose and those gams , believing she could be Judith Anderson . And you . You went for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Sunday evenings . Those readings . " " I heard about those readings , Rod , " said James Francis . " No/body got in that Chapman-Lang did n't approve of . Her own handpickedstooges . They 'd come out here and stuff themselves with your food and your booze , and then go to your little jewel-box of a theater and applaud on cue . " " It was n't always as bad as that . " " Yes it was . Sometimes it was worse than other times , that 's all . I used to hear about it from some of the stooges . They delighted in telling me , because they figured you and I were on the outs . Just out of curiosity , what did you pay Olga ? " " Oh  --  maybe a couple of hundred dollars a week . " " Like five hundred a week ? " " I guess it was about five . She charges ten dollars an hour , you know . " " Well , that 's less than a Powers model , which she certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which in a way she was . But five hundred a week is n't bad at all , considering that you supplied her with a car and most of her meals . Did she have totin ' privileges ? " " What 's that ? " " You never heard of totin ' ? That 's a time-honored custom , by which the servants are allowed to take home as much as they can carry . Sugar . Butter . Meat . " " You do n't have to put the blast on Olga , " said Rod . " I think I do , " said James Francis . " All right , but lay off Mellie . " " No , I wo n't lay off of Mellie , either . " " She had a very hard time there towards the end . " " She gave a lot of other people a hard time all her life . " " But not me , Jimmy . That you 'll never understand . You did n't see us together , so you do n't know how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , maybe you were , " said James Francis . " It took a while , but after we were married about a year or so we began to level with each other . Angela was the big aristocrat , and she never let me forget that I was n't . But Mellie was from the same kind of people I came from . Mildred Walsh , from Valley Stream , Long Island . Her old man a car inspector on the Long Island Rail Road , and she was knocked up by a booking agent when she was seventeen years old . She was a straight woman for a magician and God knows what else before she got in pictures . But once she was in pictures , boy , she was in her element . She played it their way , as tough as they come , and fighting all the way . "  | " Oh , so you fell in love with her ? That must have been a sur-prise . " " Yes , I fell in love with her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mind you . But gradually it was there , and I did n't care if I never saw anybody else . I did . Once in a while I 'd give a little screw to somebody or other . I laid Angela the night before she went back to England , and I told Mellie I did . But Mellie was so much smarter than I was , she would have guessed it . And she did n't give a damn . Mellic was a pro , , a real pro . More than I ever was or ever will be . Angela was a bum . She had nothing going for her but being a bum . Well , Mellie was no angel . But she had something else going for her . Acting . Being a movie star . That 's not supposed to be much , is it ? Making faces in front of a camera . But for over twenty years people all over the world paid to see her make faces , and she was bigger at the end than she ever was . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any morals ? She was Mellie , Melina Waltham . Over in Japan  --  Japan , mind you  --  three fans of hers committed suicide when she died . You ought to see some of the letters I got . Over eighteen thousand letters . I do n't know how it is with a writer . But with Mellie , and to a certain extent with me , you get a feeling that you 're with those people every minute of the time . They know who you are , you 're in their thoughts , and you multiply that by two hundred million people  --  two  --  hundred  --  million  --  people  --  and there gets to be some kind of a thing in the air . We never knew about radio till a few years ago . Well , it 's that kind of a thing . It goes back and forth between you and those people . Only it does n't exactly go back and forth . It stays there . It 's there . Yes , and Mellie had it , whatever it is . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I married Mellie . The two of us had it together , and with all those people . Back and forth , but at the same time just staying there . It would take a writer to explain it , but I do n't know if writers ever feel it , and if you do n't feel it you ca n't explain it . I feel it , and I ca n't explain it . I had a letter from a young girl fan of mine , which she was embarrassed to sign only her initials . She asked me if I went to the toilet . Well , I used to wonder the same thing about George Washington , and here was a kid asking me . So I wrote on the bottom of her letter and said , Just like everyone else , signed , Rod Fulton , ' I do n't answer much mail , but I answered that one . With Mellie this thing was as close as she came to a religion . She was a Catholic when she was little , but she lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in vawdaville . For a while she tried Science . Christian Science . They had those booklets backstage . I remember them , in a tin boxp219nailed to the wall . Help yourself . She tried that for a while . No go . Then she came out here and got to be a star , and instead of a regular religion she got this feeling towards the public . Towards picture businessand the public , the two of them combined . They kid around about I belong to my public , ' but by Christ there 's something to it . There 's positively something to it , and radio is the closest I can come to describing it . But explain radio ! The ether . The airwaves . The oscillation . I got some of that in the service , but it was too deep for me . The Norden I could understand . The bomb-sight . They wanted you to understand that in case the bombardier and the navigator got hit , and there was n't much to it . But the whole air full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while you 'd get one kraut talking to another . That 's too much for me . I can put out my hand here , now , and make a fist . You know what I 'm doing when I make a fist ? I 'm squeezing the hell out of a lot of human voices and music , all in the air . This I never would have thought of but for the fact that I married Mellie and we used to exchange ideas . She was way ahead of me . I guess nobody else ever knew that side of her . " He had come to the end of his soliloquy , and the subsequent silence was a part of it that James Francis respected by his own silence . " Well , what are you thinking , Jimmy ? " " I 'm thinking that you 've begun to grow up , " said James Francis . " Well , was n't it about time ? " said Rod . " How would you like to come and live here . You could have the guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place belongs to Mellie . " " You 're right , " said Rod . " I think I 'll put it up for sale . You and I go abroad , and when I come back I 'll live in a hotel . You 're absolutelyright , it belongs to Mellie , and if I stayed here I 'd start talking to myself . " " That can get to be very dull conversation , I can assure you from experience . I 've often tried to explain to a tennis player that I did n't mean to kill him . They do n't listen . They 're not tuned in . " " You know , I never even think about that , the Palm Springs thing . But I guess you do . Does it bother you ? " " No worse than if I 'd killed somebody , " said James Francis . " But you did  --  oh , I get it . Well , we both need a trip . You be my guest . " " No . " " Then how about if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some old story you never could sell any place else ? "  | " That would be different . That I 'll go for , " said James Francis . " The old saying is that the studio can do anything . My version of it is , the studio can do anything  --  and damn well should . " They were companionable again , each knowing that the conditionsof the relationship had been changed , had been compelled to change during their separation . The circumstances of Rod 's coming under the influence of Melina Waltham , and of James Francis 's guilt neurosis , affected each man individually ; as a pair of individuals they could function as friends if there were a tacit understanding that the once dominant James Francis was now the dominated . Perhaps the subtle difference was most evident in the fact that where James Francis had once made all the arrangements to suit his own convenience and pleasure , he now continued making the arrangements but to gratify the wishes of his friend . Rod frankly used him , almost to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Society of the post-war gyrationsin Florida , Long Island , and the ski runs . He got into some famous houses and some well-known beds , and James Francis became accustomed to being left behind . On only one occasion did he protest  --  when Rod went to Sun Valley . Sun Valley implied skiing , and Rod simply announced to James Francis that he was off to Sun Valley for a week . Before the week was up there were pictures in the newspapers of Rod Fulton and Ernest Hemingway in shooting clothes . " Why did n't you tell me you were going shooting with Hemingway  --  the one guy I wanted to meet ? " said James Francis . " I did n't think of it . You do n't like to shoot , " said Rod . Then realizing the tactlessness of the remark , he made it worse . " I mean , I thought you would n't want to be around guns . " " One way or the other , you 're a liar , " said James Francis . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take you along . But do n't call me a liar . " " You are a liar , and now I do n't want to meet him . If he can stand your gibberish for a week , he 's fallen pretty low in my estimation . " James Francis stormed out of Rod 's apartment in the BeverlyWilshire . It was five or six days before Rod  --  as though nothing had happened  --  invited him to accompany him to the races at Santa Anita . James Francis , as though nothing had happened , accepted . But something had happened , and things like it were happening rather frequently . " One of the papers called me , " said James Francis one day . " They wanted to know if it was true you were going back to work . "  | " What did you tell them ? " " I said there was nothing to it , " said James Francis . " Good . They 're going to make the announcement Friday , for releasein the Monday papers . " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . It was all very hush-hush . We did n't want to make any announcement till it was all set . " " You have a story ? " " A great story ! An original written by some refugee . He used to be a playwright in Vienna . Or maybe it was Budapest . I can never remember his name . Vlas-loss or something like that . Nagly Vlas-loss . You probably know who I mean . " " Not from your description . What about my story ? " " Oh , do n't worry . They 're going to pay you for it . But they do n't want it for me . " " You mean you do n't want it for you . " " Hell , what do you care ? You 're getting your money . A hundred and twenty-five gees , I understand . " " I wanted the credit on your first picture back at work . " " Well , they might be able to work you in somehow . Split the credit on the screenplay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there by itself . " " Not always . " " Damn near always . What did he write it in ? Hungarian ? " " I guess originally . I read it in English . " " That 's for sure , " said James Francis . " No use getting a fig up your ass about this , Jimmy . This is a story you could n't have written anyway . It 's about a guy in the ResistanceMovement . " " Where was your Hungarian resisting ? In Malibu ? " said James Francis . But The Star , as James Francis sometimes called him , was as unpredictably considerate as he was carelessly tactless . On James Francis 's fiftieth birthday Rod said , " I have a present for you , if you 'll have dinner with me tonight . " " Sure . We were going to have dinner anyway , " said James Francis . " Well , I wanted to make sure . What size Cadillac do you wear ? " " You 're kidding , " said James Francis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect a Cadillac . " They met at Romanoff 's , their usual table . The proprietor camep222and sat with them for a moment . " Old boy , Rod tells me it 's your birthday , " said Romanoff . " Yes , Mike . Do n't tell me you 're going to break down and buy a drink ? " " I have no such intention . However , I may take it under advisement . See you later , old boy . " Rod and James Francis had a couple of drinks . " Well , God damn it , where 's my present ? " said James Francis . " It 'll be along , " said Rod . " Then let 's order . " " No hurry , " said Rod . They had another drink , and then Romanoff came back to the table . " I believe all is in readiness , " he said to Rod . " Come on , fat writer , " said Rod . " Upstairs . " They went to the large room on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played the birthday ditty . The words were sung by the highest-priced chorus in the land  --  every major star from every studio in Hollywood , producers and their wives , writers , some directors , starlets , cameramen , old-timers from all occupations , faces , and faces . James Francis lost his breath . He turned to Rod . " You son of a bitch . You did this ? " " Mike helped , " said Rod . It was one of the great parties . Everyone there had known James Francis at some time or other , in varying degrees of past intimacy and contemporary indifference , but they had known him . He was the commondenominator , no cause of envy , and a recognized  --  just now recognized  --  veteranof picture business . They all wanted to speak to him . " Rosemary Theby , for God 's sake . How 's Harry ? . . . Regis Toomey . Read this to me , Regis Toomey . I always have to say that . . . Vilma . How 's your golf , Vilma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He had special whispered thanks for those who had writtento him during the Palm Springs mess , and he refrained from embarrassingthose who should not have been invited and those who should not have come . The party began to thin out at ten o'clock  --  early calls  --  and again at midnight , and at three o'clock they called it quits . James Francis and Rod walked the few steps to Rod 's hotel apartment . " You going to be able to make it home all right ? " said Rod . " What do you mean ? I never made the load . Not many did , come to think of it . "  | " I was ribbing you . I meant , now that you 're fifty going on fiftyone , " said Rod . " Oh , that 's another story . By the way , I never got my present . " " Your present ? I 'll send you the receipted bill for the party , " said Rod . " It 's not deductible , either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My tax man said I 'd have a hell of a hard time explaining a deduction for a birthday party for a fat writer .

" " All right , you son of a bitch , if it 'll make you sleep better , you 're getting one . " " What ? " " It 's a book . A kind of guest-book . It was signed by everybody that was there tonight . " " Where is it now ? " " It 's locked up in Mike 's safe , overnight . I did n't want anything to happen to it . " They were in Rod 's apartment . " You know that guest-book is going to be like my Oscar , only more so . I got my Oscar for a picture I did n't think much of .

You never knew I got an Oscar ? " " Never till this minute . It must have been for that Pearl Harbor picture , that I never saw . " " It was . " " Where do you keep it ? " " In my study , over the fireplace . " " Jesus , is it that long since I 've been in your house ? " said Rod . " I used to empty the ash trays in that house . I even washed your car . " " You remember that ? " " Well , why the hell do you think I threw this party tonight ? I been working on this party for over a month .

If there 's a copy of his will , I 'm to summarize the provisions . " " Good . I want you to try to get an idea of her current worth . Call the Credit Bureau  --  you know . See if she has a charge account at Bonney 's or any of the other big stores . I 'll be calling you , so do n't send anything unless I tell you . " She got up to leave . " Where will you be staying ? " " I 'll let you know . " He had to go down to his apartment and pack a bag before he picked up Norma at her hotel . When Florence closed the door Leland reached for the telephone and dialed Karen 's number . Her secretary put him through . " It 's me , " he said . " Are you busy ? " " No , no . How are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do me a favor , if you will . Would you check on the employment record of a Betty Kaminsky ? " He spelled the last name . " It 's Betty , not Elizabeth . She 's a substitute teacher . " " It may not be easy for me if she has n't been in junior or senior high , " Karen said . " That 's all right , do the best you can . She was MacIver 's first wife and I want to know what people think of her . There is n't much chance of getting hold of anybody who knew them when they were married . " " How was his mother ? " He told her . " And as far as this Betty goes , she has traits in common with his mother and his second wife , but I do n't see that the second marriage is a case of a man trying to marry the same woman again . Physically , she 's on the other end of the scale , willowy , graceful , and fair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this woman knows that she 's ingrown , and does n't care . " " Maybe she 's become that way . " " No , she told me otherwise . MacIver must have known it when he married her . Apparently he lost interest quickly , but stuck it out as long as he could  --  in his own style . " Leland told her about the scar . " Finally he said that he did n't love her and had to have a divorce . They fought for a while , but she gave in . " He recounted the terms ofp201the settlement and then told her about the lies both of the principals had told about the scar . " Joe , it 's possible that they did n't want to remember the truth . There are things that I do n't want to think about and do n't remember correctly . You 've done it , too . " " I just wish it were as simple as that . By Norma MacIver 's account this guy was slick as hell . He gave her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wife  --  he was an accomplished , polished liar . There 's no way to get around that . His mother might have something to do with that  --  I can understand how he would get into the pattern of lying to her . There are a lot of questions still unanswered . I want to know how he got that quarter of a million . Betty Kaminsky did n't have any idea that he had accumulated so much . " " All right , " she said , " let me ask you a question : how are you doing ? " " I 'm in great shape , " he said . " I ca n't help believing that this is very unpleasant for you . It 's not the same as one of those divorce or custody things . You 're closer to it . You were upset yesterday . " " That was something else . Do n't you worry about me . " " How did your client react this morning ? " " She did her reacting last night when she saw the souvenir book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see her . She did say that she had expected something  --  which is logical , because she 's been able to live with his death only on the assumption that there were things he did n't tell her . " " Please be careful of her , Joe . " " She was calm this morning , Karen . I think that the thing you saw yesterday in the Flamingo was the result of the state of nerves she had built up before she saw me . It had nothing to do with me . " " That 's as good a reason as any to be careful . You can provide an immense relief for her  --  you know that I 'm putting it delicately . " He wanted to get off the topic . " What have you decided to do about the weekend ? " " You do n't even know if you 'll still be there , Joe . Let 's talk about it later in the week . "  |p202Her  tone had turned harsh . He did n't know how to answer her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about going to Port Smith under any circumstances . Call it an aberration if you want , but it 's the way I want to keep things . " " It 's hardly an aberration when you put it in your head deliberately . You know that better than I do . " " Please do n't try to push me into anything . I said last night thatI would think about it  --  is n't that enough ? I do n't want to fight . " " I do n't want to fight with you , " he said . " I was n't trying topush you , either . You know that . " " Do n't let anything happen , " she said . " No . " " Joe ? " " No , nothing will happen . I promise you , Karen . " " Are you all right ? " " You can bet on it . You seemed all right this morning yourself . " " I was . Still am . Do you love me ? " He thought of Kaminsky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be careful , honey . Do n't take chances . " Those days were over . He said that he would n't take chances and they made their goodbyes . Putting down the receiver , he realized that he had n't given her a message for Steffie . That was something to regret . The conversation had come apart and he could not tell who had made the first mistake . He was sure she knew it now . There was nothing he could do and he did not see himself staying bothered by it . For the first time in years he was too absorbed in the job he was doing . He pushed the button on the intercom . " What 's the number at Mrs. MacIver 's hotel ? " " It 's on your desk , " Florence said . " Where ? I do n't see it . " " I 'll be right in , " she said . The slip of paper with the telephone number was under the photographs that had come from Florida . While Florence called the hotel Leland slipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clutter . Florence gave him the receiver.  | " Give me room four twenty-one , please , " he said . " I 'm sorry , but four twenty-one checked out at noon . May I have your name , sir ? " " Hold on . " He covered the mouthpiece and said to Florence , " She checked out at noon . She did n't call here , did she ? " " No , sir . I 'm certain of it . " " My name is Joseph Leland , " he said to the hotel operator . " There 's a message for you . Just a minute . " Leland turned to Florence and made a sour face . He tucked the receiver against his shoulder and scratched his knuckles . The cold air of yesterday and this morning had caused the skin to crack . " Hello ? Here 's the message : Your book is with the desk clerk . I 've taken the twelve-thirty train and will meet you at the airport with the car . ' " " Anything else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He hung up and repeated the message to Florence . " Does she know which airport ? " " Of course not . If I know my client , she 'll be at the Internationalwondering why my Cessna is n't up in the pattern with all the intercontinental jobs . I ought to land there so she can pay the fee . " " You 'll be going to Phillips , " she said . " I 'll send the telegram , if you want . " " Good . Make the call to the airport , too . Tell the line boys I 'll be ready to go at three o'clock . She left the souvenir book at the desk at the hotel , which was good of her . Pick it up when you get a chance . I 'm going in to get things squared away with Mike . "  |p204AT  FIVE THOUSAND FEET HE TRIMMED OFF , ADJUSTED THE CARburetorheat , and throttled down to ninety miles an hour . There was a tail wind that let the plane slip along without struggling . Under him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled swiftly rearward . Instinctivelyhe waggled the tail and looked back . Clear . It was clear ahead , too . A flotilla of cumulus was anchored harmlessly in the east . On that side of the river the railroad track stretched as straight as a cable , and two miles down , a freight train moved toward him . He opened his collar . If Norma had wanted , he could have shown her how to fly . He had taught Karen and Stephanie and Mike and Warren Johnson , but he never tired ; he loved flying , and it had taken him years to become accustomed to that development in his personality ; it was part of him now and he enjoyed it . He had learned to fly ; he had made it a happy thing ; he wanted to share it . Perhaps Karen had been more right than he had thought in her suggestion about MacIver and Betty Kaminsky not wanting to remember . By the time MacIver had met Norma he could have told the lie so many times that he had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Karen believe because it helped her  --  he had begun to believe it , too , a little , because it flattered him . MacIver 's story would have flattered him , too , measured against the truth . Maclverhad been slick , but he had not used the lie in a malicious way . At lunch yesterday Norma had said that she had told her college boyfriendthat there had been only one lover before him . In all three instances  --  if the suggestion about MacIver was right  --  the truthp205would have been a burden to the people who would have had to bear it . Leland had to think of the night in the car with Norma when MacIver had been so emotional : remembering that , the suggestion had a certain validity . For entirely different reasons the suggestion fit Betty Kaminsky far better than it fit her first husband . She was more than involved with herself  --  she was lost in who she thought she was . Her second husband had told Leland that she had been worse . Leland had no choice but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no question about her ego , and MacIver had given it a terrible beating over three years ' time . With her , it was simply a matter of saving face . At the heart of it Karen had been talking about what happens to people when a marriage fails : sometimes , a kind of insanity . It was possible that Leland 's current custody case was only another example , compounded . The ex-wife could be taking on a boyfriend to prove to herself that she could give love ; the ex-husband could be hiring private detectives to establish that she had not been worthy of his love in the first place . In custody cases Leland could n't entertain such considerations . He rarely had more information than he needed to do his job . Colin MacIver was different . It was exactly into this area that Leland had to press . In this job the justifications and selfappeasementswere more than simply lies to work past , they were factors subtly operating on the truth . MacIver had lied to Norma because of who they were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacIver was the thing . It was only possible that he had had no malicious intent . There was the way he had treated his first wife  --  with his reservations , Leland generally accepted her account of MacIveras her husband . She had called him a coward , an apt enough name for a man who came home bleeding after three years of marriageand would n't explain why . Her story made things of her , too  --  and not just another liar . Leland wanted to know what kind of man divorced a woman like her and then turned around and made little Norma happy . There was Kaminsky , but Leland did not think he could look at Kaminsky and see an image of MacIver . For one thing , Kaminsky was n't so interesting , and he did not wear well . Leland liked him less for not knowing his wife as well as he had thought , andp206for leaving her in the kitchen  --  there was something despicable in that . The most important thing about Kaminsky was that he was there . He was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between them . No , Kaminsky told Leland nothing about Colin MacIver . And this was only one facet of MacIver 's life . He had died . He had been on the roof of a racetrack . He had had business up there , and it had been concluded when he had come down . And the quarter of a million . There was definitely more to Colin William MacIver than a glimpse of the mechanics of guilt . Leland was drawn to that , as Karen had pointed out unconsciously , but very clearly . You 're closer to it . He had not thought of it , but he was drawing on parts of himself that were not usually for hire  --  and never in custody cases . What diverted Leland now was not the separate reasons for Karen 's concern  --  Norma , Port Smith , the idea that he had been thoughtlessly dredging through his own life for the keys to another  --  it was that the basic motive was so near the surface , and that she had made the necessary associations so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was myth to him was reality to her , and however close he thought he was to the way things were between them , he was never as close as she was . She was the center , and his understanding came through her good grace . Down below , like a string of beads being pulled over a piece of lace , the freight train moved along the lightly snow-covered ridge beside the river . In the airplane , the steady sound of the air-cooled engine had almost the same effect as silence . Leland felt isolated , and he wanted to believe that he was over a very quiet world  --  he knew he was deceiving himself . On both sides of the river , as far as the ground haze allowed , he could see farm buildings and wooded sectionsand snowy fields , brown and yellow and vivid , gusting white . Winter and summer , this was the route he flew to Port Smith , down the river without radio , charts , or landmarks , to the crooked X of Phillips Airport in Clausen County . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the radio stations reached here , and even some of the stronger transmitters of Port Smith . Delivery trucks brought the newspapers morning and evening . There was no such thing as isola/Lion ; this was very much the world in which MacIver had lived and died . He had traveled on those railroad tracks down there . At the northern terminus of the line , Leland had his wife and daughter  --  his entire existence . At the southern end was a grimy and blighted city of three million , still diverting itself with the search for Mary Shoftel  --  Leland had heard that while he was packing  --  and in a very few minutes , because the weather was so clear , Leland would begin to see the inverted dome of soot and smoke that rested permanently on the area . After the war when he had returned from his stay at Lake Charles , Leland had felt the sensation of coming home . Now he was indifferent  --  removed . He had learned that there were other cities and that each had its own character and charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that of a man thinking back on an old girl friend , punishing himself with fantasy . He was not deluding himself . When this was over he would turn and walk away . If he did not feel comfortable in Manitou , then he knew he could never live in Port Smith again . His reasons were not the same as Karen 's . They had to do with her . One time , before the war , he would have never believed it would come to this . Then , too , he would not have believed he would ever walk out on her . His old captain , Bill Richardson  --  he was dead now  --  had had a way of staring off into space , as if he were reading the future . Most people agreed that they did not want to know what was coming . The way most people lived their lives , and Leland was among them , they did not want to know what had passed , either . " I do n't think I 've seen you before , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't my neck of the woods , " he said . Her green eyes sparkled . " Sounds as if you do n't like it . " It was a party at a sorority house on the Jefferson campus ; one of his friends had asked him to come . " I did n't say that , " he said . " I like it fine . My name 's Joe Leland . " " Karen Widener . I 'm a guest here , too . Hello . Do you always talk so tough ? "  | " I did n't know I did . You 're not from Port Smith , are you ? " " All my life , " she said . " Well , we all sound the way I sound  --  except you . " " I did n't know I sounded different . " " Your voice is more musical , " he said . " More polished . It 's hard to believe . " " Are you saying I 'm a phony ? " " Of course not . I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance ? " " I wanted to see what drew the crowd . You 've had characters around you all night . I could see that you were attractive . It 's the voice . The voice cinches it . " " Maybe it 's saying something . " " In this context it does n't matter . " She looked at him . " You like to tease , do n't you ? You want to get my goat . " " No , not at all . I want to hear you turn phrases like get my goat '  --  tell me how you do it . Tell me your secret . " " Okay , okay . Now I 'll have to think about it . You may have spoiled my evening . " She leaned back against his arm . " How old are you ? " " Nineteen , " he said . " I thought I was older than you . I 'm twenty . I 'll bet you work . " " It is n't supposed to show . " " Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know you people from P.S.C. never believe it . " " I guess that means you , " he said . " I have two jobs , " she said . She watched him . He did n't know what she was getting at . " You have only one , " she said after a moment . " I 'm not trying to get rich . " She said , " All my money goes toward tuition and expenses . I 'm not getting rich , either . " " You 're not getting help from your family . I see . Sorry to hear it . " " There is n't any family , " she said.  | " You 'll have to explain that . " " There never was , " she said . " I moved out of my last foster home two years ago . I 've said something now , have n't I ? " He stopped dancing . She pushed him until he started again . She said , " I want you to know right off . God knows why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've never sprung it on anyone like that before . And you 've tried to keep my attention with a trick right out of Huckleberry Finn . You 're not even handsome . " " You 're out of order . Settle down . " " I 'm settled . I apologize . Do n't be angry . Let 's have a good time . I want to , I think . " " 1 ca n't remember our house when there was n't talk about cops , " he said . " I 'm as familiar with the precinct houses in this town as any civilian , save a few old buffs . " They were in a cafeteria across the street from the department store where she worked on Saturdays . He had asked her where she wanted to have dinner and she had said a place where she could kick off her shoes and maybe put her feet up on a chair . " It 's not a question of any one thing or some nasty subconscious motive , " he said . " For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useful  --  at least , within my reach . " " Okay . " " Fully satisfied ? " " Yes . " He had frightened her . She had asked about his politics and he had assured her that he was not a Fascist . She was certain that there was going to be another war . Although she had no time for the political clubs on campus , they had her sympathy . They were n't going to stop the war , of course . She did not know how it would interfere with her own life . She wanted to do something important  --  what , she did not know . She enjoyed work ; she was most happy when she had more than she could do . So far , since she had been on her own , she had done well . Her friends said that she was going to have success . She did not know who her parents were . There were reasons why children were passed over in adoption centers . She could have been a sickly baby or she could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit . When a child reached the age of three or four the market for her disappeared . The records were kept secret , but she had no interest in that time of her life . She had been in three foster homes and had been treated well . She was in touch with the families , but that was all . She did not think about it much . All her life she had had her own room  --  the state required it in foster homes  --  and her habits and attitudes probably were her own . The past two years had helped her find herself . She really did not know how she was going to spend the rest of her life . She hoped that it would go well . She hoped it very much . " Are we going to see each other again ? " " I 'll call you next week . " " That 's sort of diffident , " she said . " I will call , Karen . " " Do you always say what you mean ? " " Relax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 've put it away . You do the same . " " I 'm saying other things , too , " she said . " I know . I like you . I ca n't say more . " " I see . Yes , all right . " That Tuesday , when he called her , she was out ; and when he did get her the next night and tried to make a date for Saturday , she was busy . He settled for Friday . They made their arrangements , said goodbye , and did not talk again until they saw each other . It was as if they had not had the intimacy of the weekend before . She came down to the foyer of the dorm with the same nervous vivaciousness that had attracted him at the party . It was something she used on strangers , and now he knew it . They went to a movie on State Street , sat through it silently , and then stopped at a coffee shop . She talked about what she had done during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , but he was not going to admit that to her . On the sidewalk he took her by the wrist , like a child , and hailed a taxi . " What are you doing ? " " I 'm sending you home . " The taxi stopped in front of them andp211he opened the door . Perhaps she had not heard him properly , because she got in . He passed two dollars over the front seat . Karen turned to him , frightened . " You 've been nothing but a pain in the ass tonight , " he said . " I 'll let you figure out why . Maybe when you want to stop kidding  --  " He let it die , because it would be a confession . He closed the door and gave the cabdriver the address . The cab moved out to the traffic and Joe Leland , who had never done this before , watched it go , so scared he was shaking . She called the next morning . " I 'm sorry . " He had to brazen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you again . " " I do n't want a repetition of this week , " he said . " Can we have lunch today ? " It meant traveling downtown to meet her at the store . " I have work to do . " " What about tomorrow ? " " All right . There 's a bank on the corner of Franklin and Kenmore . I 'll meet you there at one o'clock . " " I 'll be there . " He was there first , wondering if she had outsmarted him , but then the trolley came and he saw that she was on it . He watched her get off , unaware of him . It was a cold , raw day . Bundled up , she looked around for him . He had never seen her by herself , and for a moment , before she saw him , it was a pleasure he could not have imagined . He wanted them to be themselves today . She saw him and waved . He did not know what he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she crossed the street to him . " God ! " she cried . " It 's cold ! " " All we can do is walk . There is n't a place open for blocks . " " Then kiss me hello . I need a reason for coming this far . " " I thought I was the reason , " he said , still very nervous . " You are . That 's the idea . " He kissed her . " Your nose is cold . " " So 's yours . Come on , let 's walk . "  |p212He  headed them toward State Street , as if the lights there could beat back the wind . Finally he told her that he was broke . She did not want to go back to the dormitory , she said , and opened her purse . He argued lamely and took the three dollars she could spare . They went to a movie and sat in the last row of the balcony and necked . He found out that she knew how to soul kiss . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to move away . Out of the corner of his eye he saw her smiling and she took his hand and squeezed it . She was happy , and for all that he did not understand about her , he was happy , too . Three nights a week he was the admissiohs clerk in the emergencyward at the City Hospital on Division Street . On the night Karen came down without calling there were three people on the benches waiting to see the intern , two drunks who had scuffled and fallen , and a man who had walked over from his job after something in his dinner pail had disagreed with him . Leland was interviewing a middle-aged woman who said she had a foot on her chest . She would not give her correct age . As Karen came in Leland said to the woman , " Then I wo n't let you see the doctor . The paper ca n't read twenty-one plus when you have a pair of lungs in their forties . The X rays will show that . Suppose some doctor upstairs thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'll send out an ambulance . Think about that . " He turned to Karen , standing behind her , smiling . " Are you losing blood ? " " No  --  no . " " Have a seat , please . " " You wo n't let me see the doctor ? " the woman asked . " Definitely not . " She leaned forward . " I 'm fifty-three , " she whispered . Leland pretended to write it small . " Now if you 'll have a seat over there , the doctor will call you . " He wrote , " Complains of difficultybreathing , " and put the sheet to the side , under the others . " Next , please . " Karen came up and sat down . " I have heart trouble , " she said.  |p213He  wrote it down . " You 'll have to explain that . " " There 's a young man I know  --  " " Do you love him ? " " I do n't know . He 's the only real man I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to all the admissions clerks , " he said as he began to draw triangles around her name . " I had nothing to do , " she said . " I hope you do n't mind . " He leaned back and patted his stomach . " It 's fine , but what am Igoing to do Thursday night at this time , when you 're not here ? " " Do n't think I would n't like to follow you around , " she said . " Are you going to wait until I 'm through ? " " Yes . " A policeman came in . " We need a stretcher with restraining straps , fast . " " Right . " He got up . " Get behind the desk , Karen . " The litter was in the other room . When he had wheeled it out , the police had brought in their man , a little Negro bleeding profusely from the face . He was screaming , cursing , and kicking out . As the officers tried to maneuver him onto the litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw him onto the litter . " Sit on him , " Leland said . He fastened the ankle straps . " Left arm , " he said . " Now the right . " Then he locked the chest strap . " What happened to him ? " " He went through a window . Do n't know his name . " The cop looked down at the man . " You son of a bitch , you 're lucky we did n't pump a couple into you . Look at this overcoat . Who 's going to pay to have it cleaned ? " " We 'll get his name later , " Leland said . " How about you ? Are either of you hurt ? " " I skinned my knuckle on his teeth , " the cop said . " First door on the right . Wash it off . There 's a bottle of iodine on the shelf . Leave your name and shield number on my desk and I 'll do the report . I 'll get the doctor , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to the door , but she was out of sight . He had another half hour before relief . She was waiting for him at the corner . " I 'm sorry . I could n't help it . I had to get out of there . "  | " That does n't happen every night , " he said . " I do n't know what made me run . Life is like that , I know it , but I had to go for the door . Maybe it was seeing you in the midst of all those flailing arms and legs . One thing , you 're brave enough for the police . " " You did n't notice the protection I had . You should n't concentrate on me so much . " " You ordered them around , too . You told him to wash his cut and he did it . " He laughed . " He saw that I knew that he would n't get his sick pay if the thing infects and he had n't availed himself of treatment . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It frightened me , " she said . " I ca n't explain it . I know that there was no real danger . Maybe I 'm not ready for that side of you .

" " Come on , I do n't want to fight . " " Neither do I , Joe  --  " " Okay , forget it . " " You asked me something in there . " " I remember , " he said . " I do n't know the answer yet . I came here . And I waited for you after I ran out . I 'm sorry I ran . I 'm ashamed of it . Maybe that 's love , too . I do n't know . " He put his arm around her . " I do n't want you to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked over his shoulder into the apartment . " Is the coast clear ? " " I was n't kidding you . They know you 're here tonight . I had to restrain my mother from buying a cake . " She stepped in . " Why ? I like cake . " She unbuttoned her coat.  | " You look normal . On the way over I thought of you with a pipe and smoking jacket . I could n't help it , I laughed aloud . People turned around and stared . " " Okay , what would you like to see first ? You have to be shown around . " " Your room , of course . I 've never been in a man 's bedroom , I want you to know . " " I do n't mind the advertising , but keep the false claims to a minimum . I 'll find out if you 're lying or not . " " The hell you will . " He had been trying to tease her . " Just for you , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew another kid who tacked headlines and news pictures to the wall . I did it , too , for a while . Anyway , I thought it was smart . They 're still there . " She was n't listening . He watched her looking at all the junk of his childhood . He realized that there seemed to be no phase that he had not gone through . She appeared to like what she a w , but he could not help being afraid that she was trying to remember it for her own amusement later when she was alone . His father was on the night tour and his mother had gone up to Northport to stay with his aunt . For the first time this year she had picked a Wednesday , the one night when both Joe and Karen were free . It had seemed that the days would never pass . They had whisperedabout being alone , but when he was honest with himself , he saw it as part of their lovemaking and not the promise of more . " I wish I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have your daughter 's , too . " " Thank you for saying that . I want a family with all the other things . I do n't know what I want  --  that 's the truth . " " There are very few people who can do what you 're doing . Remember that . " " Put a job in front of me and I 'll do it , whether I have any feeling for it or not . I 'm still in college , so I 'm preparing myself , but when I get out I know I 'll just take the best job I can find . It wo n't matter . I want to know myself better than that . " " Do n't ask so much of yourself . Do n't think about it for now . "  | " It 's easy for you to say . You know what you want . You 've advised me more than once to stop thinking . Do you like me brain-less ? " " I like you when you see yourself as you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw that the night I met you . You have a right to be proud of yourself . " " Do you know that you terrorized me that night ? " " So ? " " Tough guy , I feel safe with you now . " " That 's a hell of thing to say tonight . " " I 'm not going to have sex with you , Joe . Do n't try to make me . I do n't want to get started on that . " He said , " I think we ought to change the subject . And get out of this room . " In the living room he tuned the radio to a dance band broadcast . She had lit a cigarette , and when he turned to her , she put it in an ash tray . He took her closely . " I 'm not going to spoil this for you , " she said . " Do n't talk that way , " he said . " You know , there are times now when you still frighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " Yes . I had a dream about that fellow at the hospital that night . You did n't see your hands . They looked so strong . " She put her arms around him . He had not stopped taking pleasure from how soft and supple she was . Before he had met her , he had not thought that anyone so slim could be so soft . He kissed her ear . " Let 's try to finish this one dance , anyway , " she said . - " I was thinking that . " " I have n't done much , Joe . I really have n't . " " I was n't thinking about that . " " You 're the first one who 's ever excited me , " she said . " Is that what made you afraid ? " " I guess so . Yes . " " Do n't think about it  --  there I go again . " " Sometimes it 's good advice , " she said . " Sometimes I just want to hold you and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " She was afraid . When the number ended he let go of her and turned out the light . His palms were wet . He loved her . He was sure that there was nothing about her that he did not love . In the darkness she took his hands . " We might as well sit down , " she said . They went to the couch . On the radio the dance band began again . He kissed her on the mouth and she kissed him back . They tried to press their bodies together , awkwardly . He reached down and pulled the laces of his shoes . She saw what he was doing and slipped out of hers . They kissed again , leaned back , and wrapped their legs together . He felt the sharpness of her garter against his thigh . She shifted back a little , not moving her legs . " You should see your eyes . You 've been through this before , probably right here on this couch . " " Do n't talk like that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ? " " I have n't asked about what you 've done , " he said . " You do n't have any trouble , " she said . If she had meant that there had been mischief in his eyes , she could not realize what her own were like . She picked at the button on his shirt . " You 're so damned gentle . " " And you think that gives me away ? " " There are times when you 're not . That 's what gives you away . You know what to be  --  and when . " " Okay . " " How do I rate ? " " How do you think I 'm going to answer that now ? " She looked at the shirt button . " Do you have hair on your chest ? " He nodded . " Really ? That 's wonderful . " He put his hand on her blouse over her breast . She watched his eyes and he let the pleasure show in them and he moved his hand as he thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit her lip , happy . He reached for her blouse button.  |p218He  stared at her . Her eyes changed ; she was not angry . He got to his feet . " Where are you going ? " " To lower the radio . " She sat up straight . " I do n't want to go to bed with you , Joe . " " You 're the one who keeps mentioning it . " " Can you blame me ? " " Yes , " he said . " And you know it . " " Let 's not fight ! " He did n't answer . She rubbed her hands against her knees . Something made him stop before he sat down again and he took her wrist to bring her to him . She misunderstood , and twisted her legs onto the couch and lay back . She brought her arms up to her breasts as if that gave him room beside her ; it was girlish and it made him smile . He got beside her . She put her face against his neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother us . " " I 'm terribly excited , Joe . My leg is shaking . " " I 'd like to see that . " " Go ahead . " She moved and raised one knee and waited . With his fingers he lifted her skirt and slip . Carefully he pulled them up all the way around . She was n't wearing a girdle . Her legs were very slim and her stockings were pulled up high . He put his hand over her garter . " Do you like my legs ? " she asked . " Very , very much . " " There are n't any freckles where you would n't want them . They start above my knees and work down . " " None on your hips , " he said . " No . " " Your bottom ? " She laughed . " I do n't know . " " What about on top ? " " Birthmarks . Hold me , Joe . I love you . " " I love you , too . You 've known it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  |p219It  took him a moment to understand . " No . " She was watching him . Now she smiled . " I 'm going to help you , " she said . He kissed her . " Do you mean it ? " " No  --  no . Stop it , Joe . I ca n't . " " Are you afraid of getting pregnant ? " " No , that 's not it , I  --  " " You have to make up your mind about what you want to do . " " I wo n't have the burden put on me ! " She was right . If they did n't go on , their frustration would leave an anger they could n't control . He knew her and he was learning himself . " Go into my room , Karen . " She looked afraid . " I do n't want to , Joe . Please . " He stroked her hair . " Go ahead . " She got up slowly . She bent over to get her shoes , then changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the button on her skirt , she walked unhappily across the room to the other door . The dishevelment of her clothing pulled at him and made him want to tell her to stop . She had believed him and her belief had made it just this simple . His astonishment with the simplicity of it kept him still until she was in his room , and then he got up to follow her . He was afraid not to be near her . She stood by the chair at the window . As he entered she stepped out of her skirt , silent and light , and what he could see of her face was as beautiful and calm as anything he had ever seen . She turned to him , looking as if she were surprised and really pleased with what they were doing . " I do love you , Joe . " " I know . Do n't take off your slip . I want to do it . " " Let me do the stockings . I do n't want to get them snagged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt with his eyes away from her . He did n't want to spoil it for them by seeing her in awkward postures of undressing . She presented herself , barefoot , in blouse and slip . He was so happy with her it played tricks with his eyes . " Do you like the way I look ? "  | " Yes . Very , very much . " " You 're not lying now , either , " she said . " I can see it . " She hugged him tightly . " Turn your back , " he said . " All right . " She giggled . " We do n't have to see each other wrestling with our clothes , " he said . In a moment he heard the bed jounce . " Okay , " she said . " I made room for you on the right side . It 's the side you always want in the movies . " " We 're going to have a long and happy life , " he said . " Are n't you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had tried not to look at her until he was ready . She was sitting on her side of the bed , half-turned to him . He had never seen anything so beautiful . He sat beside her , kissed her and caressed her breast . " Joe , I 'm scared . " " Do n't be . Just relax . Kiss me . Relax . I love you , Karen , you know that . " " I know . You 're not disappointed , are you ? " " No . You 'll see . " " You 're gentle . Kiss me . Oh , Joey , I do love you . " She put her arms around him and kissed his chest . She rubbed her face against it . " I knew I 'd like this . Thank you . " " For what ? " " For being the way you are . " " Hush up . You 're the only one I 've really wanted for this , do you know that ? Everything about you is wonderful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all I want . " " I want a lot of this , " she said . " We have n't even started . " He stroked her back . He needed her and she did not know it . If they married and she bore his children , all the gifts of love would still come from her . " Do you know all the things I 'm going to do to make you happy ? " " I 'm happy now , Joe . I really do love you . I 'm just learning how much . "  |p221He  held her against him . He had no idea of the time , but it was not late . He ran his hand over her back and she twisted and lay down . He patted her bare bottom . " Karen ? " " Do you still want to marry me ? " she asked . " Yes . " She hugged him , kissed him . For a moment he thought that she did not know that he was waiting for her to say it , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . That winter , the next spring , and the following summer , they saw each other every weekend , and late at night during the week . She changed jobs and they had to find new places to meet . They went to parties and down to Joytown , and when they were broke they went to Young Communist League meetings , put their names to nothing , and helped themselves to cake and coffee . She gave him Andre Malraux to read . One afternoon at a departmental reception one of her professorssaw him squeeze her bottom and he laughed aloud ; another time , quite late , she was locked out of the dormitory and had to spend the night at his house , and in the morning his parents found him on the couch and her in his bed in his pajamas . In August she moved out of the dormitory to a room and a half downtown . He contributed to the rent and had a key . She thought it was smug of him , having a woman downtown at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been happier , and he did not keep it a secret from her . He adored her , she understood that better now . He was willing to do the shopping , pin the hems on her skirts , shampoo her hair , and let her shampoo his . He would not tag along to push a cart for her in a supermarket while she made the selections , or stand around in a department store while she looked at dresses . She could calibrate the strength of his feeling about a thing by the amount of obscenity in his speech , and she learned that he did not like to hear her go beyond " hell " and " damn . " His method of learning was memorization . He was not a bad student , but through practice he had become capable of retaining thousands of pieces of information that did not interest him . When she told him that the way he worked made her feel like a waste , hep222did not understand why . She said that it seemed that he could do anything he put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things , like mathematics , in which he could not do well . If she felt he was better disciplined , he felt that she had the greater natural intelligence . Her interests were wider-ranged . She did not believe that , and when he began to study for the policeman 's examination she offered to help , to see how he did it . " Defensive wounds , " she said . " Cuts on the hands of a victim from trying to fend off a knife . " " I 'm going to skip around , " she said . " How long can you use a search warrant ? " " Ten days . " " What 's the telephone number of police headquarters ? " " Crown Seven , six thousand . " " Where is the Eighteenth Precinct station house ? " " There is n't any . It burned down in 1918 and was n't rebuilt . " She closed the book . " I 've had enough . Fix me some coffee . " " Full of piss and vinegar , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who 's taking this damned test , you or me ? I think youought to do something for me . " " You 're right . " And he got up to fix the coffee . They were graduated from their different colleges on the same day in June , 1940 , and on the next day they were married . The part of the ceremony asking who gave the bride away was omitted , and afterward her three foster families met at his parents ' home to exchangepolite , stilted conversation about her childhood . Pictures were taken , cocktails accepted or declined , and the affair was over by early afternoon . The schedule called for dinner downtown as guests of his parents , but he decided that an early train would be better . In the coach going north , Karen cried . It had not been the day that she had hoped for , although she could not say what that had been . She fell asleep after a while , her head on his shoulder , and when they arrived in Manitou , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the trip to the cabin they hadp223borrowed from one of his father 's friends . The fare was three dollars , and after a half hour of riding , the groom began to have his doubts about what they would find . Karen was in no mood for something primitive , gritty , and uncomfortable . He wanted to tell the driver to turn around and go back to a hotel . They came to the lake and found the cabin . In the dimness they could see one lamp down the road , swinging in the wind . The porch did n't creak , he could feel no heavy dirt under his feet , and the door swung in easily . He felt along the wall for the light switch , then he turned to her . " Ready ? " She nodded . She looked terribly unhappy . " Well , put the packages down , " he said . " Why ? " " Did you forget ? " " What ? " " Put them down . " He took them out of her hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a fool . " " Tonight you 're a bride , " he said . When he put her down again she kissed him . " Are you going to treat me like one ? " " Yes . " " I 'm so scared . We could have undone it any time until this morning . Now we 're  --  something , anyway . " " Trapped , do you think ? " " Joe , you 've been so good to me . I do n't know . " " I would have had some things another way today . There have been a few things we 're going to like later on . You 'll see . Give yourself a chance . " She stood still a moment . " Give me a kiss . " He did . She said , " A girl in the store told me about a friend of hers who spent her wedding night in the bathroom . One look at her husband and she was gone , screaming . What do you think of that ? " " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to take my medicine . " She kissed him again . " Ip224love you . I hated last night after you 'd gone home . I did n't sleep . It was so lonely . Today would never come . " " Do n't think about that . You 're the lady of the house now . " She hugged him . " You 'll be happy , you 'll see . " When they returned to the city they had another two weeks before he started at the Academy . She went back to her old jobs and he finished at the hospital . When his first department check came she began to look for full-time work in earnest . For a while she had bad luck and it got her down . There were jobs on assembly lines paying nearly twice as much as she was offered by offices and the department stores . One evening he found her in tears . He was helpless . What she felt was more than a desire to have a job she could be proud of . His salary would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and she was sure that this was the one period in their lives when they would have the chance to get ahead . There was nothing he could do ; his classes ran from nine to six and he could not even have his lunch outside . The assignments in the Department came on the basis of grades , and he did n't want to spend the next four years in Northport or Bay Slope . These things made her feel worse . She could not help him , and after she had gone through the newspapers , there was nothing for her to do but prepare herself for the morning . He would awaken her gently . Their lovemaking had a fulfilling harmony that impatience could be no match for . Sometimes he would awaken her again later , excited , and he would put his arms around her . If she awakened enough she would try to help , but mostly she slept too soundly . He would caress her until she pushed herself against him suddenly and tried to kiss him . Sometimes she moved to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished there was milk in her , and when he said no , she said she did . He did not fully understand that . For her part , she could not understand his fascination with her bottom . Neither could he . But he had it , and at times he could make her jealous of herself . She found a job : at the Port Smith Hotel , as assistant to the banquet coordinator . It was interesting work and the salary promised to pass his within a year . She would have to attend many of thep225dinners , working late in the evenings , but he wanted her to give it a try . Remembering the impressions she had made on him when he had met her , he thought that she could make a success of it . If it led to important contacts for her , all the better . The job was more of a grind than they had anticipated , and for a while she made plans to work at it only a year and go on to somethingelse . The Friday before Labor Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be photographed for the newspapers with the twenty-four other rookies . That evening they took the train to Manitou again , this time to stay at a resort . That night , or the next , or the one after , he made her pregnant , and even if there had been no war , the course of their lives had begun its irreversible turning.  |p226TUESDAY  AFTERNOON , HE REPORTED EARLY TO THE FIFTH PRECINCTfor briefing . Uniformed officers worked three shifts , the one advantagethey had over the detectives and plainclothesmen . As a rookie , Joe Leland drew no permanent assignment . His education was n't completed . On-the-job training in a precinct as busy as the Fifth had to be accomplished any way it could be fitted in . The first two evenings he was taken around on patrol in a few mild blocks in Westlake and on the third night he covered the beat alone . The feeling of newness was wearing off , he recognized many of the faces , and later , when the streets had cleared for the night , he investigated some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wrote a couple of parking tickets , waiting until his relief came at a quarter to twelve , and by twelve-thirty , he was on the streetcar home . The next evening he read on the board that he was to replace a sick man in one of the cars . It was a choice assignment and he would not have drawn it if he did not need the experience . Probably he would wait six months before getting a car again . His partner for the night , Carl Krolevich , drove . He was an overweight , curly-haired man in his forties , pleasant and a little shy . He knew Joe 's father . There was not much to a prowl car , he said . All they had to do was ride around , watch , and listen to the radio . Leland took a more serious view and felt uncomfortable with Krolevichbecause of it . Nothing happened and the time seemed to drag . Slowly they covered the streets of Westlake up to the precinct border.  |p227At  seven-thirty they had a call about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the door . She looked as if she had been fighting , but said that there was nothing the matter . Going down the stairs again , Krolevich said that he had expected it . Experience would show Leland that there was nothing to these calls ninety-nine percent of the time . An hour later they took their turns having dinner in a cafeteria on Pleasance Street . The sky was dark when they started rolling again . The September chill was in the air . Routine calls rolled out of the radio , none for their car , and Leland began to feel his legs numbing . There was no conversation now , and with his elbow on the windowsill , he watched the passing stores . On Palmetto Avenue , a business street on a slight hill , Leland thought he saw something in an auto supply store . There was one car on the block , at the corner in front of the store . " Pull over , " he said . Krolevich did . " Come on , " he said , setting the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his hand on the hood . " It 's hot . " Krolevich looked around . There were no places the driver could have gone to which he could not have parked closer . Krolevich unbuttoned his holster , then hesitated . " Joe , go around the side . Keep low as you pass the windows and the displays will cover you . Identify yourself loud and clear . We 'll flush them in this direction . " Leland nodded . His mouth had gone dry . He unbuttoned his own holster , got below the window displays , and moved to the corner . He looked back to Krolevich , waiting near the wall . Krolevich gave him a wave . Leland turned the corner . A little distance up the hill the wall ended , and ten feet beyond was a wire fence . There was no light between , and instinctively Leland wanted to draw his gun . He had only thought he had seen something , and he had to wish that the car hood had not been hot , or the car had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . He drew his gun and disengaged the safety . He tried to put his feet down lightly . At the end of the wall he peered around . Garbage . Litter . Crates . The crates were piled head/high , and as his eyes adjusted he saw a passage between them to a little stairway down , and then a door to the back of the store . There was nothing to see inside the small panes of window . Leland picked his way along . Something crashed inside the store , there was a shout , and Leland was about to alert Krolevich when the door before him flew open . A man stood there , staring , then tried to shut the door . There was another shout inside , an explosion , and falling glass . " Carl ! " Leland cried . The door opened again as Leland started movingtoward it , and this time the man raised a pistol . His eyes glazed with fear , he fired . It was like a flame along Leland 's jaw . Not stopping , he fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow the man reacted as if he had been hit with the blade of a shovel . Before he reached the stairs Leland fired again into the darkness . There was more breaking glass . " Carl ! I 'm coming through ! " No answer . He went into the darkness running , and pitched over the body of the man he had shot . The light from the street poured through the windows of the store . The front door was open . " Carl ! " The car went into reverse and came into view . The driver shifted quickly into forward gear , and leaning crazily , the car pulled away from the curb . There was a crash of metal and glass . Leland ran down the aisle to the front of the store . The glass in the door was shattered , and on the sidewalk lay Krolevich . Leland reached the sidewalk , still running , and leaped over him . The car had not straightenedfrom the collision with the rear of the police coupe . On one knee Leland aimed for the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and swerved . It leaped the curb and turned a store front into a shower of glass . Leland was up and running toward it . The car door opened . " Throw down your gun ! " The driver raised it toward him . He was fully in the light , thirty feet away . Leland stopped , braced himself , offering his profile , and took aim . He fired first , and the man slid out of the car . Leland ran up . The man 's head was on the seat . The bullet had entered under hisp229eye . Leland reached over him and turned the ignition key , then , beginning to tremble at last , ran back to Krolevich . Krolevich had a bullet in his heart . Bent over him , Leland saw his own blood pour onto the sidewalk . He felt faint now , and he got up and hurried to the radio . He sat still in the car until help came . His father had been a policeman seventeen years and had never drawn his gun . Before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from rookies to retirees without calling on their weapons for more than practice . Without having completed a week Leland had shot and killed two men and had reported the death of a partner . The percentages had had to catch up with some rookie , his father had said sympathetically . He had offered the best help . There was no answer or explanation . He had said that some of the men were upset for Joe because he had lost a partner . Lieutenant Leland knew that his son was too new to the job to have had a full understandingof what that meant . He was right . Joe Leland had not known Carl Krolevich . No one could explain what had happened . After the first noise Krolevich had become curious and had made himself seen . The burglars had raced to the back to find Leland and had panicked . When the one who had shot Krolevich had fired , the other had tried to shoot his way past Leland . At the sound of the first shot a man on the next block had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the store . Leland had never hesitated ; the man had never seen anything like it . He would never complain about the police again . The man at the back of the store had been hit twice in the chest . The bullets had entered within the diameter of an inch . Leland was able to tell his father why . He had seen the man go back and had estimated where he had fallen . Still , his father was astounded . He told his father that the second man , in retrospect , had seemed dazed by the crash . " Oh , you had to shoot , " his father assured him . " I know that I could n't take the chance . What do I tell Karen ?  |p230Does  she understand what happened , that there was n't the time to think ? " " She does n't want you to worry . Tell her everything . Show her that the thing is n't preying on you . " " Who said it is n't ? I killed two human beings , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out , that 's what I mean . She wants to help you . Give her the chance . " " It did n't take her long to get here when they called her , " he said . " There you are , " his father said . " One thing : no more uniforms for her to get ready . " " She took your uniform out with her that night . It 's all cleaned and ready to wear . Even the brass is polished . " " She did n't tell me that . " " That 's the way she is , " his father said . " I figured that out about her a long time ago . You have a hell of a girl there . Oh , yes . The newspapers are all over headquarters . They 're sorry about Krolevich , but they ca n't help thinking and talking about you . What you did makes them glad they 're policemen . You read the papers . A lot of people got a lot of things out of the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father go out . He wanted to hide . He wanted Karen to hold him like a baby . This was not the first time the desire had come upon him , but now it was what he wanted more than anything . He felt frightened and cold and he did n't care who knew it . When he came home she took the week off , and except for his trips to the clinic , their time was their own . He could not turn his head and the bandage extended from his temple to his neck , but he did not want to stay home . On the fourth night a family in a restaurantrecognized him and would not stop staring . " Do you want to leave ? " Karen asked him . " No , I 'm all right . I  --  maybe Krolevich did n't believe me when I told him I saw something in there . " " What ? How long have you been thinking this ? " " I do n't know . Maybe he did n't believe me . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Maybe he felt that . When he told me to go around the side I even thought for a moment that he was taking the easy part for himself . Why did he expose himself ? Why did n't he get a shot off ? What the hell was he thinking ? I 've been wondering if he did n't panic , like the other two . " " Did you panic ? " " No . At least , I thought I had my wits about me . I did n't shoot until I saw that the man in the door was going to shoot me . It happened so quickly that he did get the first shot . Then I shot to kill . I could have aimed low , but I was afraid for myself . He would have killed me . The other one , too . I had to stop them both . I would have to do it again exactly the same way . " He stopped . " Well , what do you think of me ? " " The same things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a long time ago . I know that you 're thinking of it for the first time . It keeps you away from me . " " And ? " " I 'm unhappy . You are n't the same anymore . I 'm not crying . I 'm waiting for you to learn to live with it . " " I 'm still wondering how Krolevich threw his life away . Come on , let 's get out of here . " At home she had things to do . He turned on the radio . It would be a week before he could return to work . He could still feel the responses of his body to what had happened . He was not an unusual man . He had not wanted Karen 's mothering until he had been frightened . She had said that he was n't the same . He was n't a thoughtful person , he knew , and he would let his mind lose its hold on what he had seen and done . That itself was curious and terrifying . Karen brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to sit beside him . " How do you feel ? " she asked . " Better . I 'll be all right . " " Are you comfortable ? " " Sure . What 's on your mind ? " " I do n't know how you 're going to react . I do n't know what itp232means yet , but my period is late . It does n't mean I 'm pregnant for sure . A lot of women are late all the time . " She was so concerned for him that she was trying to wish it away . " You are . You 'll see , " he said . " You 're glad ? " " Am I ? " He put his cup and saucer on the table . " Come on . I could n't be happier . It 's fine , honey . " " You 're not kidding me , are you ? " " Do you think I am ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " I 'm not . Karen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think . It changes so much . Why should you take it this way ? " " Ah , to hell with that . How am I supposed to take it ? " " That 's it , " she said . " You 're doing what you 're supposed to . Do n't fool me , Joe . If you 're not happy , say so . " " For what ? What would I do that for , anyway ? " " So the truth will be out . We 're not dishonest with each other . I want things going right . " " I 'm glad , Karen . I really am . " " I was careful . I tried to be . " " Do n't talk like that . " " I 'm not the mother type , " she said . " That 's not the way you tell it when the lights are out . Look at me . Is it ? " She kissed him . " That 's different . I 'm not the real mother type , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . She wanted to be told and toldagain . She did n't believe him . If they had tried for it , it would not have mattered as much to him . It did something to him that heneeded . " Karen , I 'm very happy . You have to believe it . " " I hope you are . I 've hated this . I 've been afraid to tell you . " " It was exactly the right thing to do , honey . " She started to pull away , angry . " Do n't overdo it , Joe . " " I 'm not . I mean it . " " All right . " She got up.  | " Where are you going ? " " To wash my face . I 'm all right . " When her second period was due and did not come they went to a doctor . They had done no damage staying away ; everything appearednormal . They told his parents and her foster parents and their friends , but she went on working , saving money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars a year , but they had spent almost as much on uniforms and equipment he did not need anymore . He had a regular partner , a man almost his own age , named Marty Harris . Marty was married and lived on Bay Slope . Six nights a week , when they were not otherwise assigned , they covered State Street and the Joytown area . They were known to the saloonkeepers and theater owners , and simply circulated . When they met friends who wanted to know what they were doing in that part of town , they were on their way in or out of a movie or had just come out of a bar . They were in a hurry , late , or not in the mood to join other people . Mostly they arrested brawlers , prostitutes , pickpockets , homosexuals , drunk-and-disorderlies , molesters , exhibitionists , masturbators , creators of public nuisance , and once , a car thief . It was easy , safe work . Bartenders offered cigarettes and bottles , theater owners offered cigarettes and candy , restaurateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest offered money . It was part of the work and forgotten . Cases in court were only complicated by charges of attempted bribery or lewdness . Marty 's previous partner had gone to bed with a really pretty whore , and from then on he had her peddling herself under his nose . Putting one 's duke in the tambourine , one way or the other , could only lead to grief . Marty had run into pretty girls , too , but , he said , he gave his wife all the action . It was part of the job , too , like sore feet , and the trick was in not thinking too much about it . In December , Karen 's boss asked her if she was pregnant , and when she said yes , the woman fired her . The job was not for a woman with a stomach . " That was the way she put it , " Karen told him the next morning.  | " Just as cruelly as she could . It was loathsome to her . I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening before , he had already left for work . Now the sun had been up two hours and he was aching for bed . " It was all I could do to get home , " she said . " I wanted to come looking for you . I just came home and cried . What are we going to use for the money I could have made ? Oh , damn it , Joe ! " She stopped , curled her lip at her cigarette and dropped it , from the height of a foot , into her coffee cup . " Tomorrow I 'll call those people who pay you to address envelopes . " " Let 's see what happens , " he said . " Well , maybe I 'll call them . Look at the mess I made , " she said . He finished eating and got up to clear the table . When he was done she said , " I 'm sorry I 'm in such a bitch , Joe . " " Hell , you were hit by a brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette and , after fumbling with the matches , got it lit . He went over to her and put his hand on her forehead . " I 'm all right , " she said . " Come to bed . " She shook her head . " I 'm wide awake . " She stood up . " You 're being nice . I 'm trying to be cruel . " " I did n't hear it . " " It was there . The funny thing is , I would like to go to bed  --  and pull the covers over my head . " He kissed her cheek . " I need my sleep , Karen . I really do . " " I know . Okay . " Later , when he awoke , he found her asleep beside him , on top of the bedclothing , still wearing her slip . He left her alone , and later still , when he was ready to leave for work , he put a cover over her . She murmured something and he kissed her cheek . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he came home again the following morning , she was in bed in her nightgown , asleep . That afternoon he opened his eyes as she entered the bedroom , her coat unbuttoned and her kerchief undone . " How are you feeling ? " he asked  | " All right . I 've done the shopping . Let me warm my hands and I 'll get your breakfast . " She slipped out of her coat and sat beside him . She had on one of her maternity outfits . " I 've decided to get used to these . I wore one to the movies last night . " Color came to her face . " Make way for the pregnant lady . " He rubbed her stomach . He was still trying to get used to the hardness of it . She leaned over and he kissed her . Her lips were cold from the outdoors . " I take it you want to do me more damage ? " she asked . " That does n't sound cooperative . " " Try me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic , " she said . " Angry with me ? " " No . No , I 'm not . " " I know you 've had a bad week , Karen . I 'm trying to help . " " And so am I , " she said . " I do n't want to rattle around here with my belly hanging low . " " You 're not . You 've been home exactly one day . " " I 'm going to call those envelope-addressing people tomorrow . " " Why did you hesitate now ? You still have n't answered my question . " " Fine , " he said . " It took me a moment to remember what you were talking about . And why tomorrow ? Yesterday you seemed ready to do it today . " " I was hoping I 'd get more encouragement from you . " " I want your promise that you wo n't try to do too much . They pay by the piece , and we can use all the money we can get , we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself sick about it . " " I wo n't . " She stood up . " Then it 's settled . Come on , I 'll get your breakfast . " He grabbed her arm . " Stick around , " he said . " Have your breakfast first . We 've talked too much . " In the next week she called all the places offering work at home ,  |p236even  some regular employment agencies , but could turn up nothing . She did not stop looking ; she kept her reactions from him and he knew she could be not less depressed , only more resigned . Without telling her , he asked at the Precinct if anyone knew of a job , but more and more he could see how he and Karen could get by on his income alone , so that when she mentioned taking a twelve-dollar course at Jefferson in the evenings , he urged her to go ahead . The baby was due in early May and she could not possibly finish the course , and that defeated the idea at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the months before it became impossible for her to do anything but wait , but as the months passed the problem settled itself . Her moods shifted more quickly , and he could not tell when to get close to her and when to stay clear . At times she would not let go of his hand , and at others she would not even want to talk . Physically , everything was supposed to be perfect , but she looked and acted more tired , and found herself more disabled . She had to keep her legs up and her back had to be rubbed . She watched the veins in her legs , but none of them popped . Of course he had to tie her shoes , and later , fasten her brassiere . He liked the shape of her even in the last month and he told her so , but she could not believe him . He would come up from behind and put his arms around her , and no matter how receptive she was , she would challenge the pleasure he got from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of letting him see her undressed , and while he was terrified , a little , for her sake , he was still very pleased for his own . He did not challenge the pleasure she got from finding that she still excited him , but her pleasure was changed : harder , less consequential , not truly satisfying to him . He knew these things and could not deal with them . They had quit making love in her sixth month , not stopping suddenly , but after having tapered off . The act of love had become of less consequence to her . She was still willing to please him in the ways she could , but he would not let her . It was gratification without the giving of love and he did not want it . She was hurt anyway . She was his lover in spite of what they did not do , and he did not get his fill of caresses and finding her in his sleep . If she did not understand him , itp237was because she was not capable of understanding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times if he was a conspirator in a baby shower planned for her . Such things worried and occupied her . She had to have his opinion on purchases she made for herself or the baby . It was as though she still wanted to know that she was loved and thought about , and her mind found new ways for her happiness to replace the old , in which she had somehow lost her confidence . The lapse made him love her more , and in some way , it made her more appealing to him . There was a baby shower and he was a conspirator in it , and enough of her college friends came to make it a success . She cried , and she was not a woman who cried . In the next days she showed him that she had been made genuinely happy , and her guilelessness was something he knew he would not forget . She modeled the dressing gowns she had been given and asked which ones he wanted to see , and she worked on ideas to make his life easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 5 in the afternoon and he saw Karen that evening during visiting hours . She could not keep her eyes open . " How do you feel ? " he asked . " Empty , done  --  I do n't even want to eat . I tell you , Joe , I do n't want to do it again tomorrow . Or next year . " " Of course not . " " Promise me . I may change my mind , but let me have that privilege . Just promise me now . " " I promise . Do n't think about it . You have to take care of yourself . " She relaxed . " Did you see her ? Did she look all right to you ? " " She looks fine , " he said . " I hope you do n't mind the dark hair . " " No . " She smiled tiredly . " Do you love me ? " " Yes , very much . I love you very much . " He took her hand . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , stay with me . We 'll have more children . I have to get that out of my system . "  | " Sure . " He kissed her hand . " I 'm so glad you 're well . I 've been scared to death  --  dizzy half the time . " " You ? The nurse told me not to let you open your jacket becauseyour gun would frighten people . She knew who you are  --  what you are . She remembered . " He kissed her hand again . " I was n't exaggerating . I loved you when we got married , but I had no idea that there was so much more to it . " Joe , I love you the same way . " " Thank you . " It was barely audible . When his vacation came they went up every day to Northport . During their courtship they had never gone to the beach ; now , with Stephanie on the blanket under the umbrella , they took turns in the water and going on errands , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Karen began to believe what he had been telling her , that motherhood had improved her figure . He knew from his own experience that she would not believe him alone . He had never been convinced or flattered when she had told him that she thought he was handsome  --  she had lied that first night . Now , after trying to assure her about her appearance , seeing both sides , and knowing he was right about her , he had begun to feel some of the pride she said she felt in him . It was an exhilarating feeling ; and at Northport , when she was admired by other men , it was a pleasure for her of which he knew he was a part . They felt satisfaction with each other , gratitude and deeper affection . At the end of the two weeks they were much closer and they were rested . They were able to say that the confusion seemed to have been taken out of their lives . They had people over in the evenings and they alternated going to the movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much to Stephanie ; she ate and slept and looked at things at random . The radio did not attract her attention and they had to prove to themselvesthat she was not deaf . He clapped his hands behind her and she cried , and then he regretted having startled her . He was not very good with her . Karen was good and looked good with her , holding her , cuddling her . It was an element of Karen he had not anticipated . She was a good mother and as time went on she became a better one . Itp239was not in him to see and give as much as she did , but he felt no mystification , only pride , and while his own love for the baby grew , he simply imitated his wife , as happy about it as any of the expected parts of fatherhood . Their first attempts to make love again were failures . They should have been prepared for it , they realized later . Part of the trouble was their tension ; they kept listening for the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , then in the living room with the bedroom door closed . The other part was the hurried , thoughtless way they tried to get to each other . It occurred to him on the second night that they had solved nothing by moving to the couch ; it intensifiedtheir single-mindedness ; it was more like a scrimmage than an act of love . With the baby asleep they moved the crib into the living room , near enough to the bedroom door , and went to sleep themselves . When she got back into bed after the early morning feeding , it was not a failure . Later , when the alarm went off , he woke up to find her sitting beside him , smoking a cigarette . " Good morning , " she said . " Something on your mind ? " " I had to think about it . It was the daylight , I 'm sure of it . " " Do n't get yourself into any habits . We have to take it when we can get it . " " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were on the night tour . Whether we did it when you came home or before you left , there was daylight . I did like it . Maybe it was all I needed to solve my problem . " " You thought you had a problem ? " " No , not really . " She smiled . " Okay . Get out of the bed . Fix me something to eat . " She kissed him . " You 're a good husband . " They prepared for the examination for Detective Third Grade , and the day after the Saturday he took it , the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor . The Joseph Lelands were at his parents ' apartment for dinner . His father went through the building telling the other tenants . They crowded into the apartment to wonder and listen for later bulletins . A few of the women cried and the men tried to guess whatp240would happen . Leland hated it . He hated the idea of it , and after a while , he heard none of the jabber around him . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to fight . He did n't want to go away from home . That was all that it meant to him . He had to think of the kind of war it would be and how long it would last , but what he felt most , like a charge of poison in his system , was the disruption of his peaceful life . He was sitting in the kitchen thinkingthese things and Karen came in and sat across from him . He gave her a game smile . Some teen-agers entered , making noise . For more than a year now , he had been their hero . " Joe ? What are you going to join , Joe ? They 're going to take you , too , so you might as well enlist . " He looked at them . Karen was watching him . These were his first thoughts on the matter . " I 'll go into the Air Corps , probably . " " Hey ! That 's great ! No kidding ! Hey , why ? " They were drunk with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run if I have to , " he said , laughing . " I want to come home . "  |p241THEY  READ THE NEWSPAPERS AND IN THE MEANTIME THE EXAMINAtiongrades came through . His grade was high and he was in the first group to be promoted . The Philippines fell and in the darkness that followed there were predictions of defeat . There were stories of the Japanese plans for invading the United States , murder , rape , and enslavement , and the misery changed , among the people he knew , into a hatred and anger he could not have imagined . The war was to be a war of vengeance . The absurd conception of America as a peaceable nation that had never lost a war was given broad , welcome circulation . One evening he and Karen tried to project , carefully , thoughtfully , the course of the fighting . There was a good chance that the Germans and the Japanese would achieve all their war aims . The Russian spring offensive could have any outcome , and the attack on Tokyo by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could reckon the resources of the enemy . A series of swift blows , if they could be delivered , could put America out of the war . He committed himself to the test for Detective Second Grade while he waited . He made the highest grade and his name was placed at the top of the list . The week after the promotion he learned that he was going to be drafted , and impulsively he took the step that he had mentioned casually , bitterly , on Pearl Harbor Day . That night , he was able to tell Karen , too , that his police rank would be frozen for the duration of the war . He would pick up where he had left off . " I 'll get a chance at flying . Probably my reflexes are n't fast enough . It will be bombers or transports , if I make it at all . "  |p242She  had looked for work in the morning and found a job on the first try . She would be inspecting valve guides on an assembly line . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice ; no one they knew was not somehow involved . Now she bit her lip . " What is it ? " he asked . " You 'll do well . You know you will . " " I wish I did . " " Your eyes are better than perfect , you know that . And as for your reflexes , they 'll have to go some to find a set that are faster . You 're alive because of your reflexes . " " I 'm not sure . We 'll see what happens . " She was proved right on both counts . Still , he started with a handicap , for the college boys of his class had followed the barnstormersand air shows and a few had even built airplanes of their own . More , he was the oldest man in the school , twenty-four , and the only one of the three who were married who had had no flying experience . Until his first flight in a Ryan Trainer , he was willing to write himself off . If the Ryan could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it well . He knew it . Watching the others , he knew he was better than any of them , and soon they recognized it . He could fly better than anyone in the class , tighter , faster , closer to the design limits . His instructors granted that he was a natural pilot . He was as proud as a boy and he was willing to try anything . He was sent on to Advanced Fighter Pilot Training at Lake Charles , Louisiana . In the spring of 1943 he arrived in England with the bulk of the Eighth Air Force , and like most , absolutely fresh . The Fourth Group , the Wolfpack , had already seen action in British Spitfires , but with the Eighth Air Force becoming fully operational , they were switched with the rest to Republic Thunderbolts , and a lot of what they had gained in combat experience they lost in having to learn the new airplanes . Heavy and faster but less maneuverable , the Thunderbolts looked like flying milk bottles . They weighed seven tons , as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter aircraft at that time , Pratt and Whitney superchargedp243Double Wasp engines , eighteen cylinders , two thousand horsepower , capable of pulling the Thunderbolts at speeds in excess of four hundred and thirty miles per hour . He wrote to Karen , " To some of the men I am the leader because I am the oldest and presumably the most experienced . Not all of them have to shave every day . They want me to play the role of Raoul Lufbery for them and I do like it . Most of the boys can sense how close I am to you and although they will probably never meet you , they would like to marry women like you . What I mean is , the man I am is a reflection of what you have done for me . " This last thought is one of many like it that I 've had recently . Absence makes the heart grow bolder , if you will indulge that . I have the desire to do a lot of loving through the mails . I just want you to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Later he wrote , " We have been working out like football players . More than most people want to realize , aerial combat is a team effort , and the men have to know each other well . In our exercises I have been working with 2nd Lt. William P. Gibbs , of Oakland , California . Billy will be my wingman . He 'll have to protect me . I am the offense and he is the defense and counterpunch . He is twenty-one and single and a cheery character . He is an excellent pilot and I am in good hands . Where I will be going he will be , too , protecting me . It is something to think about  --  there are a lot of things on that order over here . " Karen wrote to him : " It is hard to believe that only a year and a half has passed since the start of the war . Three windows out of five display the flags to show someone in the service and I have seen a few gold stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of our lives . There is not much complaining . There is more comradeship , if anything , as a result of the sacrifices we are making  --  and little enough , most of us find ourselves adding . There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that we are going to win this war . We are working like hell in the plant and it is like that day and night everywhere in town . It makes me want to cry and I have cried  --  you and Billy are not alone . You are n't , and we want you to know it . Our love goes out to you.  | " P.S. I am rolling my cigarettes on a little machine . What do you think of that ? " " We went into action today , " he wrote . " I am safe and sound . The mission was as escort to our big friends  --  the bombers  --  and that 's about all I can tell you . We were attacked by a pack of Messerschmitts , so I have had a taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life . No one could have a clear picture of what happened . I got on the tail of one , shot at him and maybe hit him , but he shook me off as easily as a man shrugs a fly off his neck . One got on me , but Billy chased him . It was over as fast as it began , but I had my eyes open  --  I mean this , Karen , or I would not have written any of it  --  and I think I have the hang of it . Billy feels the same way . We wo n't have trouble again . " The next time she read of his combat experience was the next Wednesday morning . On the front page of the Port Smith Herald the headline of a small , boxed item near the bottom of column eight read : " P.S.P.D. HERO GUNS DOWN THREE NAZI PLANES . " On his third mission they were jumped halfway to the target area by a pack of ME-109 's . He was on the perimeter with an unobstructedview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock high . As soon as he had the command he turned into them and kicked in the supercharger . The ME 's had gained an equality in the first pass in having acquired the height ; going downhill , the Thunderboltscould eat them alive . " Are you with me , Billy ? " " Right behind you , Joe . You 're out in front . " " Shut up , the two of you , " the squadron leader called . In finger threes and fours , the 109 's spread out as the distance closed . Leland seemed alone in the front , burning fuel at the rate of a gallon a minute . He sighted in on the lead three-finger group , kicked the rudder pedals left and right , and sprayed . Instantly , by insane luck , the middle plane exploded . The outside ME 's broke left and right . Pieces of the middle plane splattered against the Thunderbolt as Leland powered through the black smoke , terrified . A man hadp245died because of a lucky shot that could be in store for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . " Going down , Billy . Cover me . " " I 'm with you , fella . " Leland skidded around to the left and followed the second ME down . He was already lifting into his first pass at the bombers . Leland crossed the arc , found him spread-eagled in the sight , and split his fingernail pushing on the button . The Messerschmitt flopped over and fell . " You picked one up , Joe . Do n't show him much . " " Right . " Slipping back and forth , he looked over his shoulder and saw Billy lining up on his pursuer , and another lining up on Billy . Leland feinted left , pulled up hard right , rolled , turned , and leveled as Billy 's pursuer pulled up to intersect Billy 's arc . Leland fired into his exposedunderside . Bits and pieces tumbled away , then smoke appeared . The pilot rolled the ship and pulled on the canopy . Past him now , Leland looked back and saw him tumble out . Someone else had engaged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the B-17 's burst with a flash . Another churned smoke from two engines . Chutes opened . Debris rained out of the sky . Pushing his airplane in the attempt to get back to the fight , Joe Leland could feel nothing but horror . The next day , in the same place , he made his fourth kill . Two days after that , over Holland , he made kills five and six . The Herald had followed its boxed item by recording the fourth plane on an inside page . Numbers five and six rated page one in all the Port Smith papers , and editorials in two of them . He had become an ace , the first in his squadron , the first from the Port Smith area . Karen sent the clipping to him . " You can see now that you ca n't protect us from what you are doing or the dangers that you are facing . There are some functions as a wife I can still fulfill , and if you feel you want to , write all that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you were after the robbery at the auto store , but I know you and what you 're thinking about . Perhaps better than you I know why you have done so well over there , and it is n't only because ofp246your eyesight or nervous system . You could n't do the same outside the frame of public service . Think and see if I am not right . No need to tell you we are all very , very proud . Please , please take care . You know me , too , and you know what is in my heart  --  all the time , every day and every night . " There was nothing he wanted to put down in writing . He had seen bodies and fragments of bodies falling out of the sky and he did not want Karen to have a picture of it . The newspapers liked to write that the fighter pilots were the last soldiers fighting man-to-man , and more than in any other part of the war it was true , but the net effect , day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It showed them all that daylight bombing was a disaster of the first magnitude . That the war in the air was not the romantic tournament the newspapers were saying it was , was reason enough not to try to correct the impressions at home . If the Port Smith papers had fixed on him as the personification of a lie , and he hated it , he had to be glad that he was being protected from having to tell the truth . Karen could see into him , but only if he helped her . He did not want to write about the truth , so he did not , and he wrote about the things that came to him readily when he sat down to write . When the Port Smith City Council passed the emergency bill allowing civil service employees to take their examinations while in the military , Karen did not simply inform him of the fact and wait for his reply . The forms , old tests , and all the study books he needed came in one package . " Now I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd like to go back to college in the evenings . Your parentsare willing to mind Stephanie . The more I think about it , the more I feel that this is my big chance . After the war the colleges will be jammed with ex-servicemen . Also , one field with real opportunity for women will be opening up wide after the war  --  education . I will want to work even if we have more children ; you know that . The success I 've had with Steffie makes me think that I will like teaching and be good at it . I can do well , Joe , so please say I can try . " He said yes , amused and curious about her asking his permissionso carefully . In his letter he treated the issue seriously , because it was important to her and she would be straining to see if he reallyp247meant yes . If she knew him , he knew her better . She had to see that he was satisfied with her , and she had to know that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Holland , he and Billy Gibbs , separated from their squadron and assisting a crippled Liberator back to England , fought off a half-dozen Messerschmitts and FockeWulfs , shooting down two , damaging two , and sending the others running . For the action they were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . They were interviewed by reporters from Port Smith and Oakland , a syndicated columnist , a commentator for the Mutual BroadcastingSystem , and a camera crew from Movietone News . All three Port Smith papers ran on their front pages a wire service photograph of Leland with his arm through a hole shot in the wing of the Thunderboltwhile behind him his mechanic painted the ninth swastika on the fuselage . In a letter he received later Karen reported that all of her conversations concerned his exploits and that he had become a public property . People wanted to know what he was like and if she had had any idea that these things were going to happen when she married him . " I answer no because it 's less complicated . The truth is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . I have tried to tell the truth once , in psych class , where the professor , a very graciousold man , started the hour by saying he 'd never had as a student the wife of an air ace . He congratulated you and said that I must be very proud . I said I was . He asked the question and I said yes . I told him  --  the class , really  --  about your strong sense of duty . Some of them had n't known about the robbery . He said that he 'd always been curious about the personal lives of men like you , and I said yes , that 's too bad  --  very quickly , you know , and without malice , and we all laughed . He laughed , and said something very nice to me . You 've said it but I am showing no modesty in telling it to you . Very casuallyhe said , Your husband must need you very much . ' Of course he meant that I had your interests at heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Embassy and took the examination for Detective Lieutenant . The results came back quicker than they would have under normal conditions . He hadp248passed . In January , at the end of the month , he went home for thirty days . It was his first trip home since Christmas , 1942 . She met him at ten o'clock in the evening at the downtown railroad station , her hands in her pockets , her kerchief loose around her neck . He had changed , he realized , as he saw her face . Her eyes filled up and she had trouble speaking . He put down his valise . " Hello , Joe . " " Hello , honey . You look fine . " He took her in his arms and kissed her . He sobbed as he held her . When he moved back she took out her handkerchief for both of them . " Stephanie 's with your parents . We can go there or home , whichever you want . " " Let 's go home . " She unbuttoned his coat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her fingertips . " They know how to make them impressive . Joe , I hope you 're proud . " " This is no time to talk about it . Come on . " In the cab they kissed and held each other . She had put on a little weight . It was the starchy diet , she told him , and he would see many people who had been affected by it . He had put on another five pounds . He had put on ten pounds in training , all muscle , and he was at the highest weight of his life . The small talk ended abruptly and she put her head on his chest and he looked out the window . The changes in the city were as she described them in her letters , and there was a bleakness on the streets , fewer cars , and in two gas stations they passed there were cars up on blocks . In a first floor window of their building was one of the rectangular flags , and upstairs , in their own , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as he paid the cabdriver he watched her . He wanted so many things now ' , but most of all to protect her from this . It was too much to ask of her , and he wished there was more for her that he could do . The war was hurting them more than they could guess  --  he could see it in the way she put the key in the lock.  |p249She  led the way up the stairs . " You can call your folks if you want to . They said it was n't necessary , that we could wait until morn-ing . " " Let 's not make any decisions , " he said . " I do n't want to call them . " She turned on a light and removed her coat . Nothing in the apartment had changed . He took off his coat and began to unbutton his blouse . She looked at him and smiled . She undid her skirt . " I put in the diaphragm before I went down to the station . I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep you waiting . " " I love you , Karen . " " I love you . Let 's go into the bedroom . Did I tell you how much I missed you in there ? " " No . " She took off her blouse . " I have . " She finished undressing . He had been watching her and was not done . When he stood up she looked at him . " In my own waiting I have n't thought of what waiting would do to you . " " I 've tried not to think about it . " She moved to him . " I 'll make it worthwhile . " She kissed him on the mouth . He put his arms around her slowly , touching her smooth skin with his fingertips first , drawing her to him so her breasts just touched him . They stopped kissing and looked into each other 's eyes . She looked vulnerable and small . FIe drew her to him again and kissed her neck . At first she did not move , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly . She pressed herself against him . " My baby . I love you , " she said . " I love you so very much . " " Hold on , " he said . " Are you going to carry me ? " " I want to . " She made herself ready . As he lifted her he felt her body shudder , and instinctively he thought that she was going to cry . He did not think he understood it . She held him tightly as he carried her to bed , and then , as he put her down gently , she looked up at him , teary ,  |p250smiling  . " I missed you . I love you . Are you going to tease me ? " He shook his head . " Give it , then , " she said softly . " Let me be your good wife . " They were different with each other and knew it and did not try to force themselves . Four weeks was not enough time . They were careful but not like strangers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tasted different or if his mind had altered the things it had had to remember . But she loved him somehow , and somehow his happiness in being with her was real . It was a joy settled on a very strange sorrow , and he knew that if it troubled him , it troubled her , and he said nothing about it . What she had to overcome to be a wife to a changed man was enough to make him weep ; it made him love her more . They did not have the time to clear away the tension of all the things they needed to discuss , yet they gave to each other . It seemed to him that she gave more than he did . The idea that he was on a rest from risking his life was an unrealistic way of seeing it . She saw it that way , and thus had no rest herself . In no sense were his needs subjugated , while hers were . He had had the option of transferringto the United States and had turned it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written nothing about it ; perhaps she had been as blind as he had been to their needs before he had come home . Two nights before he was to leave he told her he was sorry . She said he was being foolish . He did n't answer . In the next days they seemed further away from each other than they had been at the start , and at the railroad station the last afternoon , there was the feeling that nothing had been accomplished . She knew it as well as he did , and she broke down and wept bitterly . Holding her , he could not help thinking that there was a limit to what people could take , and that they had reached it . The discovery gave him no satisfaction , because he could not tell how much of the damage they had done themselves , separately and together . He kissed her again and held her tightly . The act itself became its own meaning , and he could not let go of her . He held onto her as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she could feel what was happening to him , not caring ,  |p251either  . He held her until the desire , for that was what it was , was fulfilled . She stopped crying , and after she kissed him in return , she smiled . He was assigned to transporting one of the new long-range P-51 Mustang fighters to England . It put him on his guard . The Mustang had the capability to protect the bombers all the way to Berlin , and to him , who believed at least in the inevitable effectiveness of saturation bombing , the turning point of the war had come . The war would end soon after the creation of the second front . He had to be careful . At the start he had set out to live , and if he returned to the fighting not remembering that because he could see the victory , he would be dead . The nature of the war in the air changed very quickly , and even the 161st , one of the last squadrons to be equipped with the Mustangs , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs and rockets , were sent across the Channel to attack small targets in France and the low countries . The formations were smaller and the successes greater . The enemy was less formidable , and the old hands were the ones who could see it best . The only answer was that the finest that Germany had been able to put in the sky were dead . It was horrible . Something had come over him . If he relaxed he went numb  --  static . When it happened he had to use his strength and will to get going again , and a mission required hours of preparation inside himself . He was not flying less well ; he could judge that . He was doing something wrong while he was in the air , omitting that thing that had made him an ace . What it was , he did not know . He knew he was not right , and he had to wait for the mood to pass , like a sailing ship waiting for a wind . On May 18 , while returning to base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Leland shot down two of them . " By the time you read this you will have known it for several weeks because the newspapermen were here again and perhaps as I sign my name here the story will be going into print in Port Smith . I became a double ace today  --  plus one , to bring my total credit top252eleven . One of the reporters told me that my record is now among the top ten in the E.T.O. , eighth or ninth  --  well behind the leaders , anyway . I have to tell you that although the reporters are good guys I am sick of their jobs . Do I sell newspapers ? The new men coming in who want to meet me expect something that I am not . I tried to explain to you months ago . Billy and I have talked it over , and I do have to be something for these men . He 's a man like me . If he can do it , so can I , ' is their attitude . That part would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to show that the attention I am getting is a pleasant and worthwhile thing by itself . In the process the fact that human beings are dying is lost . I do n't like it and I do feel that the newspapers are greatly responsible . As you may have guessed , I have been in a kind of depression these past weeks , but now I have snapped out of it , I think . I am interested in my job again  --  this job . Somehow who I really am must become clear to these kids , or literallyit will kill them . For the first time in my life I am forced to find words for myself  --  the opposite of do n't think about it , ' that I used to say so much . I have to show that I can handle who I am and what I 've done , and that I have an accurate perspective on the attendant and irrelevant nonsense . I used to think that a man grows up and that was that . But situations change and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gives is the measure of what he is . Today I told the papers exactly what happened in the air  --  that will confuse you until you read this . I 've come to the conclusion that the more said about aerial combat , the better . I am still just trying to do my job , but now my job is different from what it was . What the professor said about my needing you was true . You knew it . I do need you , now more than ever . " " I know that I missed a couple of letters , Joe , but I 've been very busy these past three days . I put off writing my term paper in education , and when I set aside time to do it , I had to put in extra time at the plant . You can take some satisfaction in the fact that there is no coasting at home . This summer I will work on my thesis exclusively , and by January I will have my degree . I have no news , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a rotten letter to receive , and as soonp253as I can snap back I will write a better one . I will send this nevertheless , as I know you want it . . . " " See ? I am having my breakfast and writing to you again . I mailed the last one before I went to bed last night . Sleep helped . I had a dream , and this morning I woke up believing that I was five months pregnant  --  I actually looked for my stomach . I felt very let down when I really woke up . We should have talked about it , at least . We are living in a sort of suspended animation , but we should have somehow reaffirmed what we got married for . Maybe I want you to tell me again what you are going to do to me . Do you remember ? I loved that kind of talk . I did , Joe . I want to hear it again from you . Her next letter , dated two days later , had a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public address system . Everybody felt the gravity of it at once and there was no cheering . Down at the other end of the shop one of the men got up on a bench and said , I think we ought to pray . ' It was superfluous . We were thinking of all of you . I know you 're in it and I pray to God that you 're all right . We are n't getting much news but we do n't think that they would hold anything back . There is that desire to talk to strangers . I heard one woman say as we were leaving tonight , Just wait until they see our production figures tomorrow . ' That 's about the attitude . Of course the churches are open . People are afraid for the country and what will happen to it after the war . In so many ways America is irretrievably committed . This is our proudest moment , but there is a deep fear about our national destiny . We will have to be something after the war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-prepared , or too young , or confused . But we do not want to see bad things happen after all that we have worked for . D-Day may someday be a national holiday , but today is a very sober day , serious and prayerful . " The tone of her letters did not let down again , and when he shot down the twelfth and thirteenth she sent him the clippings from the papers and detailed the reactions of the people she had come to know since he had been away . The letters were fuller , as if she understood better what had happened to them after his leave . She seemed to bep254working at holding them together for the time the war would last . He did not believe that it would end by Christmas , as so many were saying . He was too busy to give to her as she was giving to him and he said so , and later her answer came back : that it had not entered her mind . In July the squadron was moved to France and in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September he had ten days and he went up to Scotland with a camera . The country was much like the upstate area where they had spent their honeymoon . He enjoyed himself , and wrote telling her so . When he returned to France a bundle of her letters was waiting , the last teasing him gently but frightenedly about how he was going to spend his leave . Her next letters were in response to the ones he had sent from Scotland . He had conveyed the freshness and pleasure he had gotten from the countryside . She was glad that he had been able to rest . During the German counterattack in December there was nothingthat airplanes could do until the skies cleared . The Nazis were making their last effort , and the battle among the fighters was as fierce as Leland had ever seen it . In the next month he shot down five more planes and after one mission he found the lip of the Mustang 's air scoop shot away . He led half the squadron in an attack on a small airfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed . He was promoted to Captain . Unofficially he learned that he was going to be sent home as an instructor , and for the rest of the tour he flew as wingman to Billy , who in the process became a double ace . They alternated after a while , and Leland brought his total to twenty-one . His orders came through , he went to England and caught a ride on a C-54 for Mitchel Field in New York . He had ten days before he was due at Lake Charles.  |p255WHEN  HE SAW HER HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT THE FOURTEENmonths he had been away had n't happened at all . Then he saw that they had , because she was pale and she had lost the weight she had gained in the previous year . As he crossed the station she raised her hand in a gesture she could not seem to control , and she ran toward him , as unhappy as he had ever seen her , and pressed her face against his shoulder . " There , Karen . Take it easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " she said . " I hope we are . " " How is Steffie ? " " Fine . Everybody 's well . " She straightened up and sniffed . The strain still showed . " They 'll see you tomorrow . I  --  have to work tomorrowbut I 'll have the next day and the weekend and most of next week  --  " " Let 's get out of here , " he said . " You have n't kissed me hello . " He stopped and kissed her . She broke away hurriedly . After she had asked , he had looked for something better , and now he showed his surprise . She laughed . " Do n't worry , Captain . " She glanced at the valise . " Is there anything I can carry ? " " No  --  no , there is n't . " In the cab she asked if he had brought her anything . He said that it was only something small . She wanted to know what it was anyway . " All I could find in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from than what it was . "  | " I did n't know you had gotten to Paris , " she said . " On my way to England . " " So ? Did you have fun ? " He laughed . " I was there two hours . " " I 'm sorry , Joe . " He was shocked . " For what ? " " Nothing . I 'm glad you 're home . " She put her hands around his arm and her head on his shoulder . In the way she did it , not out of loving urge , but some wifely duty , it was wrong . It felt wrong to him , loveless and pretended , like something she had learned at a movie . Outside the apartment she asked him if he wanted to go for something to eat . He turned her around to him . " Are you hungry ? " " No . I thought you might be . " " Is anything the matter ? " She shook her head . " No . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is that what it is ? " " No . " She said something he could n't hear . He asked her to repeat it . She said it was nothing . " Let 's go upstairs , " he said . She went ahead of him . The way she was acting , she wanted him to find out what was bothering her . She unlocked the door and turned on the light . It was four o'clock in the afternoon and the blinds were drawn and the house was dark . It was the way you found a house when there was sickness . " I decided to make a scrapbook of your clippings , " she said as she went into the bedroom . " It 's on the coffee table . I even got a clipping service in case I missed any . " He did n't answer . He took off his hat and coat and sat down on the sofa like a guest . She came back wearing her slip , carrying her dress . " What 's the matter ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She removed her stockings . " I have nothing to tell you . " " Then stop treating me as if I were your third cousin from Tennessee . " " I 'm doing nothing of the sort . " She took off her slip.  | " A customer , then , " he said frightenedly . " Karen , I did n't pay for this . If you 'd rather do something else , say so . " She smiled mischievously . " How do you know how a customer is treated ? " " It does n't take much imagination , " he said more ruefully than he had intended . Now she put her hands on her hips in a parody of the pinup photographs . As parody it was sharper and more brutal than she could have wanted . They had lost control of themselves , both of them . " Come on , Joe . Come inside . " " I want to know what 's going on , Karen . " " Ca n't you guess ? " " I do n't believe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She came closer , her eyes bright . " Like what ? " " I do n't know . " " Then come inside . " She hesitated , then turned away from him , giving him no choice but to follow . The bedroom was almost as dark as it was at night . " Now you can kiss me , " she said . He did . Her skin was moist with perspiration , and he could smell it , unhealthy and sour . She saw the bewilderment and unhappiness on his face as he moved away from her . " You 're lying , " he said . He pushed her away . " You 're lying and you know it . Your clothes are in the other room . Put them on . I did n't come home for this nonsense . " " You had it in Europe , you mean . " " That does n't deserve an answer , " he said . " You were n't faithful , " she said . He did n't look at her . " You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't try to tell me you were . " " I 'm not going to try to tell you anything  --  " He looked into her face . She was frightened to death . " Now I get it , " he whispered . He could hardly see . " Thanks . " He waved his hand at her . " Get away , " he said quietly . " Go away from me . " " Joe  --  " She took a step toward him and he pushed her back violently . He regretted it right away . She fell against the door and there was a sharp crack . She stood up holding her elbow , trembling and pale.  | " Joe , I 'm sorry  --  " " I did n't mean to hurt you . Get out of here a minute . I have it coming to me  --  at least . " She went out . He closed the door . The room could be anyone 's , he felt so strange , sick , and hurting . He turned on the light and looked harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had used it . There was no reason to think that she had kept faith on any level . He did not know what to believe , even that she had let Stephaniesee her  --  he could not finish the thought . He turned to the dresser , untied his tie , and retied it as perfectly as he could . He knew that he was trying not to think . When he was done he picked up her brush and brushed his hair . He was afraid to look at his own eyes ; it would be like stepping off the world . He thought of how close he had come to sleeping with her now , and that it was likely that he never would have the chance again . He considered it , as witless as Punch . He wanted her . His desire for her was as heavy and naked as a stone . He turned out the light and opened the door . She was not finished dressing . He went to the kitchen and set out the cups and saucers . When he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally she came out . " Thank you , " she said . He did not know where to start . He did not even know if he wanted to learn what had happened . He could feel his mind evading the name she had put on him and the things that could have been seen by people who knew them . Instinctively he did not want to make it worse . He did not want to attack her . Even now she was the only person who could protect him from the pain of this thing  --  but he did not want to ask her if he was still in a position to help her . " Do you want a divorce ? " " I do n't know , Joe . I do n't know what I want . " " Are you going to tell me about it ? " " There 's nothing to tell . I was attracted to him . " " You 're right , " he said suddenly . " There 's nothing to tell . " " You  --  " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that stuff . Not now . "  | " I thought I was attracted to him . " " Are you still seeing him ? " " I told him I 'd call him after I 'd seen you . Spoke to you . But I was n't sure that I was going to speak to you about it . Or call him . I do n't know . " " Who is he ? " " A professor from school . " " The one who said I needed you ? " " No , he 's an old man . Another one . " " When did it start ? " " Last spring  --  May . Joe , do we have to go through this ? What do you want to know ? " " The idea of you screwing some other guy while I 'm getting my ass shot off does n't exactly thrill me , Karen . There are some things I want to know . " " Or what ? " " Or nothing . I 'm not going to threaten you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes . " " And what have you said ? " " I am married . " " I see . " He paused , and she misunderstood him . " That amuses you ? I did n't just fall into bed with him . It took a bit of time  --  " " Shut up ! " She stopped . " All right , when did you say you 'd call him ? " I 'm not one of your criminals , Joe . " " When ? " " I wo n't tell you  --  I did n't give him a specific time . " " Call him tonight . " His voice thickened and he felt afraid . " You call and tell him what happened here . You 're not going to see him anymore  --  at least , until I 've had a chance to think . " " About what ? " " I 'll tell you , damn it ! I 'm entitled to something ! " " Joe , you ca n't punish me for this . I wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about punishment ! For Christ 's sake , I do n't think you know what you want , and I do n't want anything to happen that does n't have to . " " How do you know what I want ? " she cried . " I know you better than you know yourself ! In this case , I 'm right and you 're wrong , and you 're going to call him ! " She was silent , cowed because he had outshouted her . She said , " All I can think of are the things you can do to me  --  in court , out of court . You could hurt me any way you want , and no one would blame you . " " That 's in your mind , Karen . " " What am I supposed to tell him ? " It was a plea ; she wanted to be told what he wanted . " That I 'm home and you 're going to Louisiana with me . That you want to . " " You expect me to say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . " She stared at him . " You love me ? " " You know the answer to that . What do you want to believe ? " In a few minutes she carried her cup to the sink . " I 'm going to call him now , " she said . " I want you to hear . " He sat still , not believing that he had understood , until she turned to him . " Come on . " He followed her to the telephone . " You wo n't have to hear his voice , " she said . " Only mine . " She had to wait after dialing . " Hello ? It 's me , that 's right . I told him what happened and we 've talked it over . . . . Yes , just now . I do n't want to see you again . . . . Yes , I do mean it . It 's final . " She listened a moment . " No , it 's final . " She took the receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It never was . I do n't want to be cruel with you , but it 's true . I was wrong  --  no , I wo n't say your name . . . . Yes , he 's standing right here , but it 's just that I do n't want to say it . I 'm not doing anything I do n't want to do . ... I understand that , and I appreciate your concern . " She was quiet . " All right , goodbye . I wish you the same . . . . That 's childish . . . . I 'm sorry if it hurt you , but you knew a year ago that you could get hurt .... That 's your opinion . . . . That 's right , goodbye . " She put down the telephone . " Joe , I 'm sorry . "  | " No more for a while . Please . " " I told you it started in May . He was involved long before I was . When you were home I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you hungry ? I 'll fix you something . " " All right . Call me when it 's ready . " He sat down , not like a guest , but a man come home from a graveside . He had said he would think , but he did not know what to think about . There were many things that he would have to learn and face , if he was going to stay . He wanted to stay ; even if he could not tell her properly , she knew it . The call settled nothing ; it could be undone with another call . She might not think that both men could see it that way . He did not want to face the fact that she had slept with someone else , but she had acknowledged on the telephone that she had talked in a way that was worse . The thoughts multiplied each other so that the core of the pain and shock extended and penetrated to the palms of his hands and the tips of his fingers . She came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put them on the table beside the chair and sat down before him . She pressed her cheek to his knee . " Thank you , " she said . " No , Karen . Get up . " " I want to say this . I could n't handle it anymore . As soon as I saw you I knew what would happen . I do n't know why I did it . I pitied him . I even hated him . I did , Joe . " " Get up . Come on . " Even as he said it he understood the reservationof trust inside him . He wanted to help her , but he could feel a fresh , strong withholding of belief . For the first time since their courtship , he was measuring her . In her own torment she did not feel the change in him . She would as she improved , and then she would be hurt again . The change made him not care . He could not help thinkingthat he had the right to tend to himself first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of mirrors , and at the end , like stepping outside again , he still blamed her viciously for having started it all . This mixed with desire . As he wondered at his thoughts he hadp262to see that he had to try to keep a rein on all the thoughts that could hurt her ; he saw again just so quickly that this was what he wanted . He bade her once more to get up . Her face was blotched from the emotion she could not expel . " I want you to lie down for a while , " he said . " I 'm not going to bother you . I 'm going to call my mother and tell her to keep Steffie until tomorrow evening or maybe the next morning . If she wants to know why , I 'll tell her you 're not feeling well . You stay home from the job , too , needless to say . " She nodded . " Is there anything I ought to know ? " " You say it so innocently , " she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , or anybody guess that something was wrong ? " " No . Would that change your mind ? " " Why ask a question like that ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " Why do you think I want to know ? " he asked . " So there would be no surprises like that , " she said . " That 's all , " he said . " That 's all there is to it . " While she slept he made the call and then called his father at work . He listened carefully for something in their voices . He could not hear it , and felt perverse for having tried . In the bedroom he stripped to his underwear and lay down beside her . Her back was to him . He kissed her neck and her cheek . She smelled like herself . She awakened and rolled to him to kiss him on the mouth . Her body was so hot it seemed feverish . " I love you , Joe . " " I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared into his eyes . He wanted her , but only half from love . He did not want to abuse her . She seemed to be waiting for that , not for him . He did not want her to whisper encouragement she did not mean . He did not want her sympathy . And he could anticipate the defeat of finding her not ready for him . He kissed her again and put his head down on the pillow . " Do you want to put your arms around me the way you used to ? " He did n't answer . He was sorry she knew him well enough top263remember his pleasure with such things . He loved her , and he was sorry about that , too . He awakened later in the darkness and , not thinking , rolled toward her and found her . For him , it was over as quickly as it began . " Did you make it ? " " Yes , " she said . " I was ready . I was dreaming about it . " She kissed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what happened , Karen . Do you understand ? There 's nothing about it that I want to hear . I do n't want to know . " " Someday I 'll tell you , " she said . " Not now . " After a while they moved away from each other . She got up from the bed and opened the blinds . The lights from the street gave him a clear view of her face . She came back and sat on the edge of the bed . " Were you faithful to me ? " " I 'm not going to tell you , " he said . It had been an impulse , but the words had come out convincingly . She got closer . " You 've never told me about any of your girls . " " That 's right . " " I had n't thought seriously about that side of you until this year . " " Remember what I told you , Karen . " " I am , sweetheart . " She kissed him . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best line any man ever gave a woman . " " I 'm listening . " " Scotland , for example . I would have believed that if  --  well , I would have believed it . I understand that Scottish girls are supposed to have very firm bodies . " " And ? " " And the way you 've always been , you could fall in love with a girl and I would never know . " " Tell me , do I love you ? "  | " Yes , " she said . " Then there 's nothing you have to know , is there ? " " Did you have a good time in Scotland ? " " Yes . " " That hurts a little  --  but you know that . " " That 's right , Karen . It 's gone far enough . " She got up . He did not watch her . He wondered how much of this she had gotten from her boyfriend . The thought seemed to smother him . There was nothing he could do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if nothing fatal had happened . It did n't have to be fatal . The more he thought about taking her to Louisiana the more it appealed to him . If she thought that he did not trust her he would forget the idea . He had begun to make plans for after the war , but he had to let them rest . He could hear her in the kitchen . This was not the first time the sounds she made in that place made him yearn for her . She was the same and his desire for her was unchanged . Quietly he got out of bed and went toward the kitchen light . She was wearing a cotton robe . She looked over her shoulder and smiled , unkempt . After Stephanie had been born he had come to the thought that he would not hesitate to lay down his life for either of them , if it had to come to that . Had he changed ? He loved them . He loved her . But he did not know . She stayed in Port Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved money while he had been away , more than they had ever had before , and they could not believe that conditions after the war would let them recoup what it would cost to travel . They could not be sure , either , that he would stay in Louisiana until the war 's end . No one knew what the Japanese had saved for the defense of their islands . The longer the assault took , the better were his chances of becoming part of it . He did not even discuss it with her . Very little had eased between them . He strained away from the idea of having to trust her . It repelled him . There never had been a current of desperation between them , and she gave the indication of wanting  --  something . She had asked again about " his women . " He had not forgotten that she had been the one to say that it hurt . Hep265was afraid to speak of it . The parts of their marriage came away from each other ; the roles of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came home on leave for Christmas , 1945 , and then , two months later , for good . He was not ready to go back to work . It was too cold to take Stephanie to Manitou so they went by train to Miami and by bus to Key West , and after two nights in a hotel he found a bungalow they could sublet , dearly , for a month . They needed time . Both of them had trouble believing that it was really done and that he would not be forced to go away again . He told her what he had not put in his letters and it did not purge him of the experience . He still felt locked in when it no longer existed . It was in his dreams ; he could feel it in the footfalls behind him . She asked if he wanted to hear what she had done . Without thinking he gave an evasive reply , and then it was too late . Her silence was nervous and sullen and what she felt inside it was entirely his fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped , but it was as if she had only misplaced them in her mind . There were times when telling her he loved her was wrong , and others when she wanted to be held , cuddled , and protected . He gave it all willingly and even guiltily and kept still about it at other times . He awakened once to find her making love to him as he had done with her at the beginning ; as she had done with him he pretended to stay asleep . The next day she was in a happy mood , but he did not ask why , because he was afraid he would lie badly . In the evening after Stephanie went to bed Karen seemed nervous , and he wanted to take her down to the beach , but she did not want to leave Steffie alone . " If I ever wanted a divorce , would you give it to me ? " " Sure , " he said . Now he saw : she wanted to fight . " Will you promise me that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than wanting to fight , she wanted to be cruel . If he asked her if she wanted a divorce now she would say no and be left unsatisfied . She would change the subject but her intent would stay the same . It would not be harmless , then . " Can I sit on the porch ? " She wanted to talk nonsense . " Sure , if you want . "  | " I mean alone . " " I know . " Later when they were preparing for bed , she said she was sorry . " I do n't know what happened . " " Do you want to see him again ? " " No  --  no . I know what it would be like . I feel all right now . There 's never a time when I do n't regret it , but when I get in a mood like the one I was in tonight I want to go wallow in  --  something . I want to wallow in anything . " He had to encourage her to keep talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young  --  older than you in years , but young . You heard me on the telephone that day . He wanted me to say his name . It upset him , yet he wished me good luck . It was false magnanimity . He honestly did n't want to see you get killed , but when you did somethinggood it depressed him . I think he knew better than I did how it was going to turn out . He wanted to marry me . He wanted to talk to you himself , but I knew what would come of that . " " What ? " " He could n't have handled himself with you . All you would have had to do was open the door and tell him to get out . He would have obeyed you . He was the sort of person who could be trussed up that way , only to get angry  --  impotently  --  later . It was something I read in his eyes . He was n't a bad person . He was bright and very witty . If you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would n't have worked out , but I would have gone just the same . He loved me and needed me . " " What did that teacher tell you ? " " I know . " " Is there any beer in the icebox ? " She nodded . " That 's another thing . He liked beer , but not enough to remember to have it in the house . He wanted it and it was n't there . " " Neither were you , " he said . " After a while I tried to be . I would be less than honest if I told you otherwise . I liked him but I never could admire him . I knew what you would think of him . You would have laughed at him  --  notp267cruelly ; you would n't have been able to help it . There was nothing to look up to . There always is with you , and that 's the difference , for better or worse . " He sat on the edge of the bed , thinking about this . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have no dignity left . She got on the bed behind him and touched his back with her hand . " There are n't any comparisons in my mind . I should n't have said it . I love you . That was something inside me , something I had to get out . I hated it and myself and all I could think of were the dirty words I knew for myself . I did n't act clean and I did n't feel clean . " " What about now ? " " I 'm forgetting . Slowly but surely I 'm forgetting . I tried to wreck the only family I 've ever had , and I want to forget it . Do you want that beer now ? We can drink it quickly and take a cold shower and then make love on top of the sheets with the windows open . " He grinned . " I 'll sleep for a week . " She kissed him on the back of the neck . " You 'll remember why just as soon as you wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked for a larger apartment . It was impossible . Barracks for veterans had been put up on the lots on the north side , and landlords of permanent buildings wanted hundreds of dollars in fees for the vacancies that turned up . She kept looking . Stephanie took over their bedroom and they moved onto a daybed in the living room . Steffie would not be of school age until September , and until then Karen could not work . The job was there and she was eager . He told her to stop looking for an apartment and shop for a car . The waiting lists for new cars were months long . Through a friend Karen located a LaSalle convertible , expensive for such an old car , but too much like a Cadillac for them to refuse . That summer on his vacation they drove to Canada . She had taken driving lessons with a girl friend and had developed into an excellent chauffeur . Driving did not interest him and he took advantage of her desire to drive . The car became hers completely and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evenings . Once ,  |p268when  they were going to spend his forty-eight hours at the beach , she came by at the end of the night tour , six in the morning . When the schools opened in September she had almost as little free time as he did . She had to learn her job . Their hours had to be organized , and in the mornings , whether he was coming in or going out , he kept quiet and let them sleep . If that was an inconvenience , he did not believe it , and it was the only change he had to make . No part of the household suffered ; there were things that distressed her , she said , but they had to be pointed out to him . He was proud of her . That did not please her much , because she had become determined . The job was not what she had been led to expect and she was disappointedwith the lack of freedom inside it . She came home angry or tired . There was no way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The money in the job became more important to her , and when she said casually that she would transfer to another school for the next year , he tried to find ways to keep it in her mind . At the end of the year he drove out to Phillips Airport in Clausen County , the largest private airport in the state , and he learned there that he was not the first ex-pilot to turn up . Some had come to learn what had happened to the old airplanes . Leland had read that the Government was selling off as many as it could , but he did not know that thousands of others were rotting where they stood  --  bombers and fighters , of no interest to commercial users . The man he talked to had seen a Liberator bought , stripped of its wings , and converted into a diner . P-40 's and Aircobras were showing up at amusement parks . They were inadequate as private aircraft , too expensive , too limited in use . They were not even good for crop dusting . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had a party to attend and as they crossed town he gave her an idea of what it would cost to own and operate their own airplane . He thought that they were restricted to a two-place plane , something like a Taylorcraft , and he was n't happy about it . She was driving and she listened , thoughtful . " Have you thought about becoming a commercial pilot ? You 're not too old to change careers . "  |p269He  said no . " That 's not the way I feel about it . It 's more a case of I love my wife , but oh you kid . ' " She laughed . " Oh , really ? Tell me about that . " " You know what I mean  --  " But something harsh had come through his tone . He had betrayed himself . In the afternoon , when he had entered the apartment , the telephone had been ringing . He had picked up in time , for the line had been open , but when he had said hello , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for as long as he had held the receiver , no dial had come on . He had touched the button , and the dial tone had sounded at once . There had been nothing wrong with the telephone . He had decided not to ask if someone was bothering her ; if there was and she chose not to tell him , she had her reasons . If he was wrong he could hurt and embarrassher . But the more he had thought , the more he had wanted to find out about it . She could want to protect him . If that was the case , he wanted it stopped . He kept quiet now as she concentrated on her driving , her face set hard . " I 've never said anything about what you did overseas , " she said . " I know , Karen  --  " " Then why did you get so rough ? " " No reason , I  --  " " Come on , I know when you 're lying . " He could not think of an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't take it lightly if something were going on now . I 've got too many other things to worry about . " " All right , there was a telephone call today . Whoever it was would n't answer when I said hello . " " And you think I 'm up to something ? You 've had this on your mind all this time ? " " No . For God 's sake , Karen , I thought he might be bothering you . " " And I was protecting him ? " " No , that you were protecting me ! Watch what you 're doing  --  " She did not hear or see . The car went through a light as another car started out from the side street . He reached for the steer/ing wheel as she saw the car and tried to brake . They could have made it around if she had used the accelerator . The other car hit them solidly in the side and they bounced once , sliding toward the far corner . The brakes were not grabbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he tried to help her , but it was too late , the car hit the lamp post head-on with a resounding bang . He had underestimated their speed and had not braced himself . He rose out of the seat and struck his head on the rearview mirror . In two hours a squad car was taking them home . He had a headache , a gash on his brow with six stitches , and a sore elbow ; she had cuts on her knees and a long scrape on the inside of her calf . She was still in mild shock . He had been knocked out , no more than a second or two , but the sight of him slumped on the seat had scared her badly . He had had to push her out of the car and direct a passerbyto call the emergency squad . No one in the other car had been hurt . He had promised the driver that the damage to the car would be paid for . It did not seem as if there was going to be a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been more serious . The LaSalle was a loss . When the car had hit them her foot had slipped off the brake pedal and she had not been able to move . He told her not to talk . The shock did not help her . She had to talk about the car and how close she had come to killing him . She had not been able to help even when he had been unconscious . She had failed him in too many ways . The car pulled up to their door . They got out and went up the steps . Suddenly she looked back . " What is it ? " he asked . " They heard what I said . " In the apartment he asked , " What did you say ? " She threw her purse onto the couch . " I told them everything . They know everything . " " That 's not true . You were upset , they know that . " " You did n't see their faces . I did . " " Take it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " She turned to him . " How can you be so calm ? " " I do n't see anything to get upset about . " She turned away again . " No , I guess not . " " Does that mean anything ? " " Not what you think ! " " I 'm not thinking anything , Karen . What 's the matter with you ? " " I hope to God you never find out . " She was undoing the clasp on her collar . Her stockings were in tatters and smeared with blood . " I hope to God you never feel this way  --  this thing , this awfulness . " " I do n't understand . " " I know you do n't , and I do n't hold it against you . " The dress fell to the floor . She did n't pick it up . " Everything seems to go well for a while , and then the bottom goes out for me . It 's happened again and again . " " Like when ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Am I a suspect ? Are we going to play policeman ? " " What other times , Karen ? I 'm not going to fool with you . " " The day we got married . You remember how I was . I cried on the train . I got scared . Before , I could feel things going along well , but the ground underneath me seemed to get thinner and thinner . I could n't do anything after you left the night before . It collapsed . I did n't recognize it then or the next time , when Steffie was born , but this time I could almost chart its progress . It happened another time I know of , too . " " When ? " " You know . " " I want you to tell me . " " After your leave . During your leave . Before I took up withwhat's-his-name . It 's not you . It does n't have anything to do withyou . It 's all inside me . I ca n't say it , ca n't touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and I do n't see how doing anything will help me . " What he could not say was that he did not understand . He couldp272not help but feel that it did have to do with him  --  that she did not love him . " Look , do I make you happy ? " " Sometimes . " She had given it another meaning . " Only sometimes ? " " The rest of the time I pretend . " " What about before we were married ? " " It was perfect . I did n't have trouble until Steffie was born . " " I remember that morning , " he said . " It did n't happen then . That 's when I decided to pretend . I sat up working it out . It did n't begin to happen again easily , like before , until we went to Florida . " " Oh , Jesus , Karen . " " Do n't you want to know about him ? " " No . " " He never did it . Never . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was , childishly . He sat down . He did not know what to think . " I love you , Joe . " " Not the way I love you . That 's clear now . " " I 'm not like other people  --  normal people . I 'm just trying to get off the roller coaster . There are times when I ca n't control what I do . I ca n't forget myself . I thought we 'd never talk of these things . Joe , I do love you . I 'd do anything for you . I 'm the way I am , but I 'm trying to help myself . Maybe there 'll always be nights like tonight when I start wrecking everything . The bottom goes out and eventually I feel this awful poison in my system . Listen , I always get pleasure out of going to bed with you . I do , honey . " He could not say that he felt it was ruined . " Do n't ever pretend anything  --  anything  --  again . Just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll do that . " " You do love me that way , " she said . " Say it , Karen . Please . " " I promise . " She meant it , it was in her tone and her expression , yet it was no relief to him , only a burden . She had said roller coaster . To him itp273was a treadmill that he had been on before . He had forgotten it , and now he felt as if he had indulged himself all this time . Still , he did not see the danger signals . She kept speaking of the accident ; months later , without warning , she asked him if he had heard anything about what she had said that night . He did n't know it , but the problem she had told him about had returned . He did not think of looking for it . Rightly she thought that it would obsess him . She made plans to stay home for the next school year . She equated it with being a good wife , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had almost done to him . By summer , he felt squeamish about what was happening . " What did you do with yourself today ? " " I window-shopped . I saw some dresses I liked , but I do n't think I really want them . " " Oh . " " Why did you ask ? " " Just interested in you , that 's all . " " Well , maybe I will get something for myself . " Neither could take the chance of accusing the other of lying . By her own account later , it took her until mid-October to remember that somebody might have been trying to reach her the afternoonof the accident . When she could retain it , the idea of seeing him again was the most exciting , thrilling thing she could think of . She met him one night when Joe was working , faking an excuse to leave Steffie with his parents . She knew that she was not fooling herself , but that did not turn her around . She was trembling when she stepped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shaking violently . Inside , she needed twenty minutes to regain a semblance of composure , and then she was bitterly ashamed . It did not stop her . It was only a matter of facing herself once , then she could tend to the reason she was there . Sickened with herself , she could even take charge . Later , with her help , Leland learned why she was able to fool him . She succeeded because the affair made her curiously more eager for him . It was his real if obscure triumph over her lover , who did notp274see it . She knew her husband better . She did not have to lie to him except for her lover 's sake , and her actions made her have to lie to him , who was still trying to gain possession of her . Sooner or later her lying and his possessiveness would have annoyed her , and with nothing to lose , she would have hurt him more cruelly than she could have hurt the man who was innocent of her faithlessness . Midway through this stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , and upset things a little . The night after Thanksgiving , on his way in a car from Police Headquarters to the Fifth Precinct , he saw them together on WashingtonAvenue . His first impulse was to scream . " Go around the block ! " he shouted to the driver , and then , " Go back about three blocks . When you come down again open up the siren and I 'll tell you when to stop . " They were still on the street . She was supposed to be playing cards with her girl friends . As he passed , drawing everyone 's attention , he did n't turn his head . But he was sure that she had seen him . Blocks ahead , he had the driver pull to the curb . In a candy store , he called Richardson and asked for the rest of the night off . " I have a good excuse . I ca n't tell you what it is . I 'm not sick . " I 'm sorry , Joe , I have to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to ask . " " Something 's come up . That 's all I can tell you . " " Calm down . Whatever it is , calm down . " " I 'm not going to do anything . I 'm just going home to wait . " " I see . " Leland had told him earlier what his wife 's " plans " were . " Listen , Joe , do n't do anything you 'll regret . " " It 's no problem . " He did n't care . " I 've been through it before . " " Okay . I 'll see you tomorrow . If you want anything , call me . " At home , he called his mother to tell her to keep Steffie overnight . When Karen arrived to get her , she was to get the message , and that was all . Her key went into the lock at twelve-thirty . He was sitting in the living room . " What is it , honey ? What happened ? " " Do n't con me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " she said sullenly . She took off her coat.  | " I went around the block a second time . " " I figured you did . So ? " " So , is this the same guy ? How long have you been seeing him ? " " I wo n't play that game . It 's none of your business . " She started into the bedroom , trying to look unperturbed . There was no color in her face . He grabbed her arm . " Now listen to me , you miserable bitch . If you want a divorce , say so . You can have anything you want . You 're no good to anybody this way . You have to decide one way or the other . " She tried to wrench free . " I 'll think it over . " He wanted to knock her down . It did not seem possible that someone he could subdue so easily by force could generate such viciousness . As he moved to hit her with the back of his hand she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out of him . Her head snapped to one side and , when she turned to him again , she was bleeding from the lip . " Happy now ? " she asked . " Are you ? " " Yes . You see , things have changed . " " You made love to me this morning . " " I do n't see what that has to do with it . " " Who is he ? " " The same . You guessed it . I 've been seeing him for a month . " " And things have changed , " he said . " That 's right . " She was trying to make him hit her again . Her heart was n't in it , and neither was his . He said , " Sleep in Steffie 's bed tonight . Tomorrow , too . I do n't want you near me . I just do n't want you near me . " " You 're a nasty bastard . That 's what Jerry said tonight , and he 's right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recognized you from the newspapers . Does that inflate your ego ? I would think so . " " Get away from me , Karen , " he said , and walked away himself . He sat down in the kitchen , and when he came out again , she hadp276gone to bed  --  in Steffie 's bed . He was not tired  --  it was the middle of his working day  --  but he opened the folding couch and lay down upon it . She awakened him . The light came through the door from the other room . " Joe ? Take off your clothes . You 'll mess them up . " He had a headache . " Okay . " She gave him his pajamas and he got under the covers . " I 'm sorry , Joe . I am sorry . " " Stop it , Karen . " " I want you to know it . " The next morning she did not want to go to his parents ' for Steffie . His mother wanted to know what had happened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed him for one , but there was no plausible lie to fit , so he said nothing . There was a certain amount that she could guess , but the way he felt , he did n't care . That evening Richardson said that he could take a leave of absence if he wanted . Leland thanked him and said that he would think it over . It was pointless . In a year or two there would be the same thing all over again . The next afternoon , Steffie went to the movies with a friend . " Listen , " Karen said . " She wants to know what 's going on . " " Tell her whatever you want . I trust your judgment . " " Joe , I do n't want to start up again . " " I do n't care what you want . As long as you have anything to do with him , you 're on your own . I did n't tell my mother anything , but I 'm sure that you wo n't be able to use her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go out on my nights off , but the kid will see you and you 'll have to explain somehow . You can see him when she 's in school , of course , but it 's not so good in the daytime  --  " She walked out of the room . She told Steffie that she could no longer sleep on the folding couch . It was a flimsy story , but she could think of nothing better . The next week Jerry Palmer telephoned him at the station . He believedthe lies Karen was telling . He wanted to know why Leland was willing to wreck her life , his own , and probably Steffie 's for something that could not work . Leland hung up on him.  |p277There  was nothing between Karen and him now . He did not want to talk to her . She tried going out on the nights he was home , but then abruptly quit . Once she said she was going to the movies alone . When she returned she threw an empty popcorn box on the couch beside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airplane . In the middle of December he found a prewar J-3 , a twoseater , in excellent condition but not much good for anything but sport . He bought it and told her about it afterward . He asked if she wanted to see it and she said no . She came in early one afternoon while he was having breakfast . It was the week before Christmas . " Is the coffee hot ? " " Help yourself . " By the stiffness in her face he knew that he had to wait until she worked around to what she wanted to tell him . " Who knows about me at the Precinct ? " " Richardson . " " You told him ? " " The night I saw you . I wanted to come home . " " How did it feel ? " " When you look him in the eye you 'll know . " " Thanks . " She stirred her coffee and threw the spoon into the sink . " You win , after a fashion . We broke up today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't gloat , you bastard . I 'm going to stay in Steffie 's room . I do n't know what I 'll be doing now . I want to be left to myself . " " Can you tell me what that means ? " " No . Let 's not talk . I do n't feel very well . " They left it at that . He did not hear from Palmer . With Christmasso close he hoped Karen would soften a little . In Steffie 's presenceshe was civilized , but nothing more . He did not want to endure the preparation for Steffie 's holiday in such misery . Still , he could not discuss it with Karen . If there was going to be anything left he could not give in to her , because it meant giving in to what she had done . Christmas went by . After the New Year he got out of bed onep278afternoon and found her in the kitchen , her face red from crying . " Leave me alone , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , go ahead . " She went inside . Alone , he had to think that this did not have to mean anything good . Palmer could want to see her again . The further Leland carried the thought the more he realized how bitter he remained . If she thought that she had had enough of his bitterness , she had no idea of what was still choking inside him . She came out again , her face washed . " Can I ask you a ques-tion ? " " Shoot . " " Where are you getting your sex ? " " None of your business . " " Are you getting it ? " He sat back . " You know what my appetites are . " " Joe , if you bring home a disease , that will be the end . " " Do n't worry about it . " " You know your way around those whores . You could be doing anything . " " I told you not to worry about it . " " Would you be willing to have sex with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On those terms ? " " That 's the way it would have to be . I would n't hold back . " He regarded her . " You do n't have any more trouble ? " " Once in a while . I 'm all right if I do n't start worrying about it . Then I lock up . " " I think I can understand that . Okay . Go inside . " " Joe , I do n't mean now . " " I do n't either . I do n't want to talk anymore . " " Do you hate me ? " " Inside , Karen . " He had had to chase her . They had accomplished something and then it had seemed as if she had wanted to kill it . Even striking the bargain , promising not to hold back , she had tried to make it too clear . Where they were now , a sex agreement was a step forward.  |p279Strangely  , it could make them more humane . He had been willing to take it for what it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . In the autumn she had courted disaster ; now she wanted more security than it was possible to have . They made love the next morning . She kissed him awake , warm with powder and perfume . She loved him , she said . He could n't respond . Afterward , she wanted to know if he was all right . He said yes . He was certain that she had not pretended . She stayed close to him , affectionate but not happy , and quiet . He knew what was to come and was afraid because he could not deny her for long . She was sick with herself , but without the terror that had followed the previoustimes . He knew he was seeing the worst part , but he could not control his reaction to it . It was not what she really was , what she had been when he had met her . Thus he felt part of the blame being thrust upon himself , and he struggled to deny it . Yet he could not accept the idea that all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had known , he would have married her anyway  --  he had to accept that fact . There was nothing he had done to help her because he had not known how she could be helped ; even now it all came from her and , mostly by choice , he took it . There were words for him , and the way he was letting it go once more , he had no right to protest . A week later she asked him if he wanted to know the real purpose behind the shopping trips . It was like a kick in the stomach . She could not look into his eyes while she said it . She had been trying to meet men . A man . She had conceived of seeing Palmer again simply because it would be less complicated . She had made a compromisewith what she had really wanted . " I wanted the excitement . I was testing myself  --  I wanted to see what I was capable of doing . Do n't ask me why . I want you to know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk and look at people  --  men . I 'd think about going someplace for a drink . I never talked to anybody , just looked . And thought . Oh , yes . Thought . I do n't have any idea why I did it . " The last time I said I was trying to hurt the only family I ever had . This time I was able to convince myself that I could get away with it without hurting you and Steffie . I hurt you anyway . It didn'tp280matter whether the sex with him was satisfactory ; the other thrill was there . It is a thrill , a deep , dirty thrill , and that 's what I did it for . I 'm sorry now  --  involuntarily sorry , if you can understand that . It 's not like after the automobile accident , when I could close my eyes and see us heading toward that pole again . I 've tried to keep my mind clear , just so I could be of some use to somebody  --  myself . But it 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up inside me , a sick feeling . " She was not saying that she would not do it again , and because she was n't he had to believe what she was saying . He wanted her to tell him when and if she felt it coming again , but even as helpless as he was , he could see that that was futile for them both as well as humiliating for her . The way she described it , in the beginning she would be safer and kinder in lying to him . As long as he was unwilling to explore his misgivings over the final meaning to or even the use of what they were going through , he had to take his chances . Twice before the end of the month she called him at work to ask him to come home . The second time , he was out of the building and not expected for an hour , and she broke down . It frightened the man with whom she was speaking and Richardson heard the commotion . He cut in on his extension and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a week Captain Leland was asking Richardson if he knew anything about his son 's wife . Richardson played dumb . Some of the men Leland saw infrequently quit asking about his family . Leland had only Richardson 's word about what they knew . The reporter who asked about his private life during the Leikman case had gotten the story easily . By that third week in March she was doing better and most of his doubts were put aside . Her resistance to the jolts of everyday life was lower ; she was quicker to say what displeased her . He could not tell if things were going to ease . She was trying . She was suffering with the effort she was making , even if it was largely misplaced . She was trying to be a good wife , which took no trying from her . He was waiting to hear her express some interest , even dreamy , of going to work again . She was at her best when she was working , and he was surprised that she did not know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie again to Steffie , sayingp281that there must have been something the matter with her back , and the girl seemed to believe it . Steffie was closer to her than him and really , now especially , he was glad . If Karen ever thought of Steffie learning of Palmer , she was not intimidated , and her husband had to wonder if it were not the girl 's confidence that kept Karen going . His own relationship with her was as taut as a wire . In the late spring the School Board informed her that a job was open for the next year , and she ignored the letter . A month later , without previously speaking with him , she went looking for work downtown . He decided to see what was going to happen . She had trouble , but she did not tell him much about it . The first week in June , she started work as an assistant buyer in a department store . He was sick over it . It was a terrible job for her . It was a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It drained her emotionally ; she resistedhim more than before . The salary was ten dollars above what she would have made as a teacher but far below his salary as a detective lieutenant . There was no pooling of money as there had been the previous year ; he paid the running expenses as he had been doing and she put most of her money into improvements in the apartmentor clothing for Stephanie or herself . One evening he saw her making a list of the things she had bought . He had to keep still . Another night , he started to make love to her and she put him off . The next night , when he kissed her , she would not open her mouth for him . " What 's the matter tonight ? " " I do n't feel like it , that 's all . " " Are you having trouble again ? " " No . No . " " Then what is it ? " " I 'm not in the mood . I just do n't feel like putting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're beyond the honeymoon stage , anyway . " " We 'll both decide that , " he said . " Are you going to push me around again ? " " When have I pushed you around ? "  | " Oh , come on , Joe , I do n't want to fight . I do n't even want to talk . I want to be left alone . I 'm doing all right . " " The hell you are . " " What does that mean ? " As clearly and calmly as he could , he tried to indicate his objections to her attitude toward him and the way she was handling herself with her money . The two of them were living lives that were proximateand parallel , but nothing more . In the darkness he could feel her growing angry . " Do you want me to quit ? " she asked at last . He did , but he could not bring himself to say it . " All right , " she said . " I know what you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things I 've been able to do for us , and I 've been waiting for you to pull this . So far as saying no to you is concerned , I 'm expressing my true feelings . It 's just not worth it to me as often as we 've been doing it . " " What do you think is fair ? " " Once a week . " " You 're kidding . " " No . I 'm not . " He could n't control himself . " I was better off when you were cheating on me . " She said coldly , " I wo n't forget that . " " Do you want a divorce ? Is that it ? " " No . I did n't say that . " He got up from the bed , thinking that maybe he wanted one . There was nothing he could do for her like this . More and more , there was nothing he wanted to do for her at all . He had to be honest . He had to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " To the kitchen , " he said . " Now I want to be left alone . "  |p283THE  OFFER FROM MANITOU MADE HIS DECISION FOR HIM . HE TOOK ITwithout telling her and waited , hoping that things would change . They did not . At the end of the summer he told her that he was resigning from the Police Department and taking a job in private business in another city . He was n't taking her . He did n't want her . " What are we supposed to do ? " " Karen , I do n't care . You have your job . I 'll send you what I can . " ' I could sue you . I could get a judgment against you . " " That 's your decision . I do n't figure that there 's anything between us anymore . " " I had the right to be told that you were doing this ! " " You think so ? I wanted you to come around by yourself , not under pressure . We both know you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of threats ? They 're not what I want from a marriage , what I think I should get . " " I stopped . I 've tried to be honest since I stopped . " " That 's not all , Karen . What did you go to college for ? You 're not bettering yourself , you 're just being important . These things you 've bought  --  it 's as if you wanted them around as proof that you are part of the world . You know you 're not really putting in the effort . You 're like a kid feeling sorry for yourself . You 're trying to show the world  --  or me . It 's just stupid . " " What about Stephanie ? " He had known while he had been speaking that he had not beenp284saying the thing exactly , but that she wanted to change the subject was her admission that he had come close . He said , " I 'm not out to destroy you . You 're a fit mother , and she does belong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the circumstances , that 's up to you . " " You bet it is . " " Karen , that 's just why I 'm leaving . Your attitude right now is just an extension of what it was yesterday . You do n't know how you feel about me anymore . Inevitably , somehow , you get down to hurtingme . You wanted to do something good when I met you . What happened to that ? You 've got yourself on a merry-go-round , doing the same things again and again . You 're back where you started from . Instead of that hotel , where the woman hurt you when you became pregnant , it 's a department store . Instead of being all bound up inside , you 're just not making love at all . You 've done good things  --  Steffie , the war work , getting your Master 's , teaching  --  but you 've also had two affairs with the same emotional cripple , and you 'd just as soon have a third  --  " " I probably will , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he pleaded . " You took a grisly satisfaction in saying that . I do n't know what 's made you like this . The world does n't owe you anything . It did once , but you 're even with everybodynow . You 're bitter about something  --  me , maybe it 's marriage , or even life itself . It 's as if you want something that is n't here . You 're full of hate , for me , your boyfriend , most of all for yourself . As long as you stay this way , you 're going to keep doing the same things again and again . None of them is going to get you the prize , whatever it is you want . Think , Karen . You 've carried some of these things as far as you could , and they 've given you no satisfaction . You 're on a merry-go-round , do n't you see ? It does n't go anywhere , and least of all to where you want . " " You can leave whenever you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He flew down to see Steffie every other Sunday , and on most visits he took her places while Karen remained at home . He had nothing to say to Karen , and if he could have arranged it , he wouldp285not have seen her at all . She understood that she could have a divorce whenever she wanted , but she made no move . She was seeing Palmer again , as she had promised . If anything , it was only what it had been before ; some lie or other was holding Palmer off , but Leland tried to keep his thoughts away from it . He felt relieved , unhappy , lonely , and not curiously , ashamed . His progress in Manitou was good and he was invited to spend the holidays with two families . He was able to decline and go to Port Smith . Karen wanted them all together for Christmas . The day was a success for Steffie , as much as success was possible . Karen was tense , but she tried to be pleasant . He followed her lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party given by one of the men under him , he drank himself unconscious . Another man , thinking he was divorced , arranged a date with his sister , a pretty brunette twenty-nine years old . Leland straightened out the misunderstanding quickly and at the end of the evening , knowing just that he and his wife had been unable to make it work since the end of the war , she agreed to see him again . By April , he was taking too much of her time for her to know less than the truth , and he told her . She did not know how she felt about him , but she thought she had a right to know if he was determined not to divorce his wife . He said no , but inside , he was not certain . He was still attached to Karen and a part of him wanted to stay accessible to her . It was an exercise in vanity , for when they had been living together , she had not thought of him . She was miserable , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for him . He liked this girl , but he was so used to Karen 's ways , her faults not excepted , that what was unique about the one only brought the other clearer to his mind . Anne 's virtues and accomplishments had no value to him , for while he was attracted and sometimes intrigued , because he was distracted , he was never in love . He knew it and , he thought , so did she . Early in September Karen moved to Manitou . In the summer she had told him that the affair with Palmer was done and she was going to apply for a teaching position in Manitou . She did not say what had happened or what she expected of him now that he was seeing someone else . He said that he did not want trouble . It wasp286cruel , but she did not seem to feel it . She said that she would not be in his way . Anne was suspicious . He told her that he did not intend to see Karen more often or let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although she tried to hide it . One evening in November they ran into Karen on Clark Street . After the introductions she excused herself quickly . He told Anne that she had been nervous , even afraid . Anne said that he would hear from her , and not about his regular visit . She was right . Karen called him the next morning . " I 'm sorry it happened , Joe . I did n't want to meet her . It was an accident . " " Take it easy , kid . It does n't mean as much as you want to think it does . " " She knows about me , does n't she ? Do you want to marry her ? " " I ca n't discuss that with you . " " I deserve whatever I get , I know . Listen , I 'm sorry about what I did to you . I 'm trying to put myself together again . I came here because I wanted to get away from that town . You had a right to see Steffie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be . I hope you know that . " " Some day I 'll tell you what happened to me , " she said . " I do n't want to hear it  --  " She knew that she had gone too far . Perhaps it had been a slip , but it did not matter . He had reacted as if she had tried the cheapest trick , and she could see it , too . She hung up . Later , what she might have intended was lost , for he could not help staying angry with her for having gotten to his feelings , and he distrusted and even disliked her more . He had the feeling that she would know that she had made him want to be closer to Anne , but he had to wonder if she was going to see that Anne 's insight into her did not enhance Anne in his eyes . Doing what Anne had predicted made Karen the more pitiable , and he was too distorted and confused by pity , apprehension , and lack of love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make strong demands upon him . He did not likep287it , yet he could not strip himself of his confusion to do something about it . The following spring , Anne broke off with him . He had let it run out of his hands and she could not help being bitter . If his shame made him think that he really wanted her , it was too late . She was too smart for that . He found himself trying to forget that his feeling for her had not been strong enough to make him take the steps to marry her . The self-pity made him cautious . He kept away from Karen . He thought that if he found her willing to start again , he would blame her for what had been his own fault . He wanted to blame someone besideshimself , and the way he felt , he could resurrect old issues no matter how much he did not want to . Far down , he did not want to do it to her . It came up months later on a Sunday evening after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had guessed what had happened to Anne and she was sorry . She thought that she probably had had a good deal to do with the breakup . Steffie was in bed . Karen had asked him to stay for coffee , but , he hoped now , not to hear her comments on the curious bonds betweenpeople . On second thought , he wondered if she was going to come right out and flatter herself . She said , " Next spring I 'll be able to apply for an assistant principal 's job . I 'm going to . My record is perfect . I 've been getting on committees and making myself known . " " Then you intend to stay , " he said . " I have a good chance here . " " What 's on your mind , Karen ? I would n't like to see you buildingtoward something impossible . " " I 'm not . " She could have hurt him . The egotism of his remark would have been hard for most people to resist . She asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ? " " Like what ? " " You 'll find out . I thought today about doing this . If I start to tell you things and you stop me , I may never be able to talk about them with anyone . I 'm not kidding . I want you to promise me that you wo n't stop me. "  | " All right . " " I 'd like you to promise me . Please . " " All right , Karen , I promise you . " " I called him after you left , as you said I would . I told him that you and I had fought since I had last seen him and that your going away was the compromise we had reached . The story was confused and his attitude was about the same as yours is now , except that he went through the motions of believing . He wanted things to work . As soon as I had him I was sorry . I was still filled with the anger that I had tried to take out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but I had to , if I wanted him to keep coming around as long as it was convenient to me . " " Is this the truth ? " " Yes . I swear it is . " " Why did n't you say anything to me ? " " I could n't . I could n't talk to anybody . There was nothing you could have done , anyway . You could n't have helped . I was too sick to be helped . " " Did you know it ? " " I had some idea , but I ignored it . I wanted to . I 'm still sick in many , many ways . " She stopped . He had not been looking at her at that moment , and slowly he raised his eyes . She was wearing dark slacks and a little short-sleeved blouse . Her hands were clasped between her knees , her knuckles white . She was staring at him , just staring . For a moment it was actually insane . " What is it , Karen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that ? " " I think so . It was a long time ago . " " When , do you think ? " " Karen , I do n't want to play a game  --  " " It 's no game , Joe . Please . Let me do it this way . It 's hard for me . When did I love you ? " He shook his head . " Before the war . Afterwards , for a while . I ca n't be sure of what you felt . I only know what I felt . " She said , " You stopped loving me the night you saw me onp289Washington Avenue . That was the start for you . You could have been brought back , if you had been given the right treatment . It would have been difficult , but it could have been done . Not by me , not by the person I was . By the time I got home that night , I did n't want to . After your mother told me that she was keeping Steffie for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I twisted everything you had done in the war and before . I expected you to punch me as soon as you saw me . " " I wanted to . " " But you did n't . I had to goad you into hitting me . Anyone would have wanted to hit me . I knew the kind of man you were , that you would n't unless I dared you , but in spite of that , as I went home and thought about you having seen me , I could n't stop imagining you hitting me . When I came up here to Manitou I could feel it inside me as I wondered how you would react to me being so close . What you would do to me . I honestly did n't want you back . I needed a clean start and this was the place , considering your rights with Steffie . I did n't want you back because the same things would have started all over again . I know that far , far better than you . I just wanted to be myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do well , yet I had fantasies  --  still have them  --  of you punching me and knocking me down . I 've never been really punched , I do n't even know what it feels like , but I keep thinking about it . " " Why . " " When I know you wo n't do it ? That 's very wise of you . " It was n't wise . He had only asked a cop 's question . Now he was sure that he did n't know what she was talking about . She was sitting there in the same way , waiting . It seemed as if she were studying him , but he knew better . He wanted to believe that she was remembering the things they had done , that he was still her husband , but what it came down to , he knew , was that she was waiting for herself , for some reservoir of strength inside her to fill again . She needed it to talk  --  she had said that she had planned this . She looked away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the only family I 've ever known . That was right . If our family had been a good job , or a lot of money , somehow I would have thrown itp290away . Believe me , I was trying to hurt myself . I do n't know why . I think about you hurting me because I want you to do the job for me . By the time I get to that , there are specific reasons why you should hurt me , things that I 've done . I 've made the reasons for you . " I cheated on him , too . I did the things I told you about . I actually did them . Do you know what I mean ? " He sat back . It was like something materializing out of a fog . It was there for him to see , but he could n't make the proper connections to identify it . He made them , remembered , and it was as if the room moved . It made him physically dizzy . She did not notice at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the breath run out of him in a rush . He did n't know what it was supposed to signify  --  outrage , indignation . It hurt her and he was sorry . He did n't understand where it had come from , perhaps the breaking of the last unhappy illusion . He felt helpless , as if desperately ill . His skin prickled , his stomach contracted and doubled up . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I do n't know what to say , Karen . " His voice had broken ; what he had said had been hardly louder than a whisper . " Just listen to me , that 's all . I wo n't say anything if you decide you 've had enough . " He was n't sure that she was n't trying to do something to herself . He did n't think he could make that clear ; she would think that he was questioning her motives for his own sake . He saw that there was nothing for him to risk and she had already surrendered every advantageover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You keep going . " " With you I tried to pick up men . With him I succeeded . You would think that after the first time I would have turned myself in at a hospital . I did n't , I only thought of it . It happened four times . I tried to tell you of the thrill in it , the sick , delicious thrill . He never found out , fortunately for him . I told him I was leaving Port Smith for a fresh start but I did n't tell him why I needed it . I did n't owe him anything . He took his chances . " " So did I. " " No , no . Listen , Joe , there are a few things you do n't have straight  --  lies I told you . I told you lies about what happened afterp291Steffie was born , that I pretended . That 's true , as far as it went . Most of the time I did pretend , but not always , as I wanted you to believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you caught me when we were just waking up . I had orgasms then and other times . I had no trouble all during Christmas , 1942 . You probably do n't even remember . And the night you came home from England the first time . In the railroad station , when I saw you , before we even got near each other , it happened a little . " " Then you did n't have trouble with Palmer , as you said . " " Why did you lie ? " " I wanted you to help me , but I thought that I did n't want to hurt you with the truth . That really was n't it . I could n't bear having anybody know the truth  --  even me . " " What about now ? " " I 'm telling you the truth as well as I know it . You ca n't help me , Joe . I can only help myself . There 's no reason to lie . " " Then why tell me at all ? " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk . I know it will be good for me . " " You could have had Palmer , " he said . " No . I ca n't explain why  --  it has to do with me . " " Do n't con me , Karen . " " You 're my husband . You trusted me  --  you still do , with Steffie . You let me know things about yourself  --  your fears , what you thought . I did n't want that from him . I 've always come back to telling you the truth . I believe that . I 'm not trying to con you . " " Did you ever have trouble with him ? " She knew what he meant . " Yes . And one other time , too . I 'm not sure it has very much to do with sex  --  why I have trouble , or even what I 've done . " She became silent . His body felt drained , as if he had endured a bad electric shock . He could n't think  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the edge : he could go to a lawyer and see how he could get Steffie away from her . There was n't a mark on Steffie but hep292was on the edge of closing his eyes to that and doing what he wanted for himself . " Nobody but me knew about any of this , " she said . " I could n't have been trying to hurt you or Steffie or even him . It was all me , for me , directed at me . I still wo n't admit that I 've failed with myself . I came here for one last chance with myself . It almost happened again after I bumped into you with Anne . I was in that mood for weeks  --  angry , sulking . Only I know how close I came to losing my job . Those men in Port Smith were married . You know what would happen to a teacher caught in a hotel . " " All right , Karen . " " You loved her , did n't you ? " " Why do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I could have made a good thing with her . " He thought of something . " Did you pick married men ? " " Yes . I was afraid of the others . I thought married men would understand , and I was right . I 'm sorry . Joe , it 's the truth . They were on the prowl  --  I do n't mean that as an excuse . They were looking for the same thing . It worked , too , with Jerry Palmer , and with three of the four others . " He looked at her . " There 's something you have to understand . I 'm trying to face up to myself . This has to be part of it . I ca n't talk as if I 'm still living in a dream . I wanted something and that fourth man would n't give it to me because he had an attack of conscience . I had to use this language to keep reminding myself that this was the way I wanted to see it . Maybe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human being . " With Jerry Palmer the first time I let myself believe that I needed sex and he took advantage of your absence . It was n't like that . I had already let you down long before Jerry Palmer appeared . I was a rotten wife and a lousy human being . I had my good moments , but nothing had turned out the way I wanted . I was jealous of you  --  oh , of course I was . I did n't like being stuck at home . I did n't like being pregnant . And I 'm sure that none of this is a surprise to you.  | " Jerry used to take me home from school  --  that 's how it started . " " Was this before or after my leave ? " " After . I swear , honey . Then when I realized how far I was actually willing to go , I thought about where you were and what you could learn . I made myself believe that I was safe . But even then I made him wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , Karen . " She touched his hand , then withdrew . " Can I ask you something ? When you were with Anne , did you hold anything back ? Did you show her who you were , the way you did with me ? " " Why do you want to know ? " " Maybe I want you to tell me that I 'm not anybody you remem-ber . " " Stop it . For God 's sake  --  no , I did n't hold back , but yes , I remember you . " " Was she better than me ? " " You 're smarter than that . In any case , I was the one who could n't satisfy you . " " That was my fault ! " " Do you want me to leave ? " " Do you want to ? " " You wanted to talk . I 'll listen . I 'm going into the other room . When you 're calm , you come out . " He sat down on the couch . The door to Steffie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why this had happened . Now , from the kitchen , Karen called him . He got up and went to the door . She was standing at the sink , her back to him . " Are you all right ? " " Yes . Joe , please listen . It 's the only thing I 'm asking . " It felt like a merry-go-round again . They were saying everything a second , a third time . " I 'm trying , Karen . Why did you ask me those things ? " " I do n't know . That 's the point . There are things I want to say and I ca n't say them . " " Like what ? "  | " Like what I did . Like asking what you did . I do n't know why . I want to know if I killed everything between us . " " You 'd have to kill Steffie . Are you willing to do that ? " " Of course not . " She glanced at him . " I do n't believe I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took a breath . " I 'm not sure myself . " " Do you know what you 're married to ? " He was n't going to answer that . " That 's exactly what I am , you know . " She turned , slowly . She looked so pale and sickly in the fluorescent light that it frightened him . " Once I started with Jerry I decided to do things that would make him fall in love with me . You have to do that . I consciously tried . I pretended and acted and planned things . There was a part of me always thinking of a new way to go further . I could n't really forget myself , so that was the way I got around it . I mean this , Joe . It was the same with the others . All of them wanted to see me again . " " A job well done ? Any woman could do it . " " I know that . Do n't you think I know it ? That 's what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went ahead and courted them anyway . " On second thought , you 're wrong . Any woman could n't have done it . The night I went back to Palmer I was so frightened I could feel my legs buckling under me . It was the same with the other men those afternoons in the hotels . Most women could n't have gone against themselves that way . All the selecting I did was in picking men who were physically attractive . That 's all . One time I did n't want to do it at all and I did n't let that stop me . It was a question of getting it out of my system . " " Why did n't you go to a hospital ? Why did n't you call me ? You could have gone to a psychiatrist . " " I did n't want to admit that I 'd failed  --  in spite of all the evidence . It 's really comic . That was important to me . Do you remember ? I was going to have success . There were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I was a ffirt  --  I did n't even realize it until you were in the service . Jerry Palmer could n't keep away from me and I tormented him . I would let him kiss me but when he put hisp295hand on me I would push it away  --  but very slowly . I never did it with you or any of the others when I was further along . He begged for that kind of treatment and I was the person to give it to him . Just the person . He thought that that was what love was all about . " " Are you excusing yourself ? " " No  --  no ! I told you how I was after I decided to go with him . My legs were buckling then , too , but I made no attempt to stop  --  other than pretending for quite another purpose . I did want to stop , I did n't like it , I did n't like him , but I went ahead in spite of it . What it was doing to me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . The next day I felt ashamed when I thought of it , but when I did n't think , I felt relieved . In some ways I was glad I did it  --  every time . Even after the afternoon with the man who did n't want to play my game . I 'd wanted to lose myself in it . I always thought hard about what I was doing , closing my mind to the things I did n't like for the sake of the things I did . " He sat down at the table again . He could n't look at her . " That 's only the half of it , Joe . I could n't help thinking and feeling ashamed . It made me afraid to go out of the house . I could n't help feeling that people could see I was dirty . I 'd call in sick at the job . That last summer , I did it too often . They fired me . " " You did n't tell me that . " She bent down beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brace herself . " How could I. ? It was proof of what I was . It reminded me of how much I should feel dirty and ashamed . That 's how destructive it is  --  the whole thing . I 'm still expecting you to hit me  --  and if I succeeded in making you do it , I 'd be indulging myself . " " That 's a way of putting it . " " I would . Life would be simpler if I could be punished once , like a child . I want it even though I know it wo n't work . " I still want the things I wanted when I was going to college . I want to have a success and be somebody . " She sat down on the floor and looked up at him . " Is that insane ? I still want to be useful . " " No . " " I know now that I never fully gave myself to that idea . There was always a part of me that held back . At first I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't control . It held back and even acted up on the day we got married . I wanted to marry you more than I 've ever wanted to do anything , and I 've never , ever regretted it  --  although you have  --  but it was there that day , something repugnant and calculating . Do you know what it is to really hate yourself ? To know that a part of you is willing to throw away everything of value and behave in an absolutely uncontrolled way ? I did everything with those men , men I never saw before . That 's why I want to hear that you did n't hold back with Anne . I do n't want to know that you saved anything that belonged to us . " " That 's the same as being punched , is n't it ? " She looked up . " Yes . " He waited for more . She searched his eyes . She asked , " Did you ? " " You really ca n't control yourself , can you ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that she was going to be sick . " I loved her , Karen . There are times when I wish she had become pregnant . I would n't have hesitated , then . " " I 'm sorry . " " That was n't what you wanted to hear . Now try to put the whole thing out of your mind . Forget it . Do n't ask again . " She stayed quiet . Then , " When we first met I was full of dreams about what my adult life was going to be like . They were n't clear , but I was going to be in the world , valuable , not necessarily important , but valuable . People were going to be pleased that I was doing my job , whatever it was , and they were going to be grateful . That was what growing up meant to me . It did n't change because I met you . You were filled with the same dreams  --  but they were better founded . You did n't plan on things happening to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . You did what you had to . " " I remember . I remember how you carried the ball after the night Krolevich was killed . I needed it . But I never had any idea of what you needed . " " Do n't start that , Joe . I did n't know myself . I do know myself now , better than I did then . I could disgust you with the things 1 think . " " Like what ? Go ahead and say them . "  | " Like I 've taken to wondering whether you were ever faithful to me . " I was . " " But things happened in Europe , " she said . " We 've discussed that . " " Not really  --  " " You know enough . That 's the way I want to keep it . " She started to get to her feet . " I only wanted to give you an idea . I wonder about you because it makes what I did more tolerable . " She cleared the table and rinsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now . Shall I add insult to injury ? " He waited . With her back to him , she said , " I could do it with you now . " " I know  --  but I 'm not going to let you . " " That 's right , That 's what I need more . Talking about it changes it , anyway . See ? I know all the tricks . I do n't really want to start up with you . Tonight made me want to do it . I 'd start giving you the rights of a husband . I 'd want to , but I know I 'm not ready . It 's too soon for you , too . What if Anne called you ? You 'd resent me if you were all tangled up and wanted to see her . Live your life and enjoy yourself . " I do n't even want to think , " she said . " It 's one day at a time for me . I wo n't go to bed with you until I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to go further . I do n't want to worry about cheating on you . We have had really good moments . I 'm not looking for it to happen all the time  --  oh , no , I know what to expect from an adult relationship . " The hell of it is that I always did know . I 've never been able to do anything about it until now  --  and maybe not even now . I have to be honest , with you and myself . " She looked over her shoulder . " Listen , if Anne does call you , you make up your own mind . I wo n't kid you about the way I feel . I 'm not capable of loving a man . If you decide to marry her , you wo n't be hurting me . " " All right . " " I mean it , " she said . " I think you do . " " I 'm sorry to have to put you through this . "  | " No . It took courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to call me now if you want to talk to someone . " " I ca n't call you about anything else , though . " I " I know that , too . Karen , you 'll never be able to bullshit me again . That 's what you succeeded in doing tonight . I remember the signs . I 'll know if you go off again . You ca n't go back . You have to be honest . " " You 'd divorce me and take Steffie , " she said . " I think I 'd have to . " She nodded , then looked up . " I 've been good all the time I 've been in Manitou . " " I thought that . " " I 'm making that offer again . I 'll just take care of you if you want that . " " That 's no good for you . " " I 'll be able to think about it later . I will , anyway  --  you know ? " Now she sat down . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there anything that you do n't know about me ? " She turned away . " Do you want to know how often I put myself to sleep that way at nights ? " " I did n't ask . It 's your business . Anybody living alone has that kind of tension . You do n't have to be ashamed of it . " Her body shook . She was crying . " You 'd better go . This is n't going to do us any good . " " Are you all right ? " " Yes . I 'll call you when you get home , if you 'd like . Steffie 's clothes are n't ready for school tomorrow . If you want to talk  --  just talk  --  from now on , call me . " " I was waiting for you to say that . " " Oh , yes , I want you to call . " She turned to him . " I need 1 Before we were married and we had that little apartment we ho paid the rent on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiest time of my life . We did a lot of talking then . " She stopped , almost hopeful . " 1 want to talk to you . I 've needed what happened here tonight . All my life I 've really wanted it much , much more than the other thing . " " What other thing ? "  | " What I was looking for . Excitement . " The word was not right . closed her eyes and shook her head from side to side . Her lip bled until she bit down on it . " Adventure . I was looking for that . dreams , " she said softly . Tears spilled down her cheeks . " I wanted romance . " He leaned over and kissed her lightly on the mouth.  |p303THE  PALL OVER PORT SMITH , A PERMANENT INVERTED BOWL OFsoot , dirt , and dust , rose stiffly and precariously in the red air like smoke over a smoldering fire . An airliner dropping from the holding pattern southwest of the International Airport slipped down deeper into the murk , nearly vanishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond was the spit of land Port Smith called the Point , and beyond that was the ocean , an oily expanse without surfaceor definable end . Nearer , the lights of the city glittered and swam in the smoke and shadow , and directly underneath , the roads of Clausen County slashed the hardening gloom in every direction . Cautiousin the presence of the heavier traffic in the air , Leland raised Phillips Airport on the radio , identified himself , and received permission to land . On the downwind leg he looked among the Quonset huts and service shacks for Norma , but could not see her . He made the final turn . On the highway at the far end of the strip , six lanes of cars , all alit , slid quickly to the left and right . Leland could pick out the letters on the neon signs along the road as the buildings rose above the black horizon . The strip came up faster ; the tarmac appeared , racing , makingthe beams from the lights in the nose of the plane converge and sharpen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , chirped , and took hold on the ground . Like a car , the plane rolled along the strip . He was down ; as if he had put on another topcoat and a pair of hip boots , he could feel the pressure of the bottom of a sea.  |p304She  was in the office . As he crossed to the counter he directed her to keep her seat on the orange plastic couch . He wanted to order gasoline and service . She came over anyway while he signed the sheet . " Why did n't you wait for me in Manitou ? " He watched the mechanic check the list . She did n't answer . The mechanic said all right and Leland picked up his suitcase and motioned Norma toward the outer door . She stayed quiet until they were outside . Her coat was unbuttoned and she held it closed with her hands in the slash pockets . Today 's smock suit was light blue and she had a little jeweled pin on the collar . She brought out a set of car keys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black hair back from her forehead and made her have to squint to see . " I had an attack of nerves . I wanted to get out of that hotel room . Until your telegram came , I had n't thought of there being more than one airport in Port Smith . I know that I should have called your office , but I was n't thinking . I just wanted to go . " " All right , no harm was done , but you have to get it into your mind who we 're working for . It 's not only a matter of making our job easier . You 'll know where you stand . Florence would have told you that I was working on your case . You would have felt better and there would have been none of this running around and missed con-nections . " She nodded , then shook her head . " I 'm not sure . " He was coming to her , not the other way around , and because of it he found himself trying to hold down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , almost involuntarily , " Let 's forget it . It was one of those things . " She came up smiling . " How was the flight ? Did you enjoy it as much as you expected ? " She was trying to be pleasant . " Yes . It was fine . " " I 'm sorry I missed it . There 's our car . " The color in the sky gave the blue finish of the Cadillac a purplishtinge . The painted metal was so deep with a wax and cornstarch shine that it looked brighter than the chrome plating on the wheels and bumpers . If the car had ever been in bad weather , no one couldp305know . It was the way Colin MacIver had kept his car . Norma would not have tried to make it look better after his death . She was doing what he had done because it was what he had taught her to do . This was a way a man continued to live through his widow , the style he had established . It never worked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Norma unlocked the door on the passenger 's side and Leland put his suitcase on the floor behind the front seat as she went around the front of the car . She looked over the convertible top . " Do you want to drive ? " He wanted to try the car , but he said no . They got inside . She said , " Some men are uncomfortable when a woman is driving . Do you have enough room for your knees ? ' I had to move the seat back again to accommodate our new , straight-arm driving style  --  the baby 's and mine . This is the way the racing drivers do it , to get leverage . Colin told me that . " " Is it the way he drove ? " " Oh , no . He sat up high and close , right hand on the wheel , left elbow on the windowsill . He drove this car with one hand and one foot . And he diddled the directional signal with his left index finger . That 's what he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe he drove the other way when he picked up all those tickets , " Leland said . " Maybe , " she said coolly . The car rolled almost silently to the exit of the parking lot . She had taken what he had said as an attack . Maybe it had been stupid  --  because he had said it , Leland didn'twant to think that  --  but he had wanted to focus her attention on their business . Now he had to begin again . She turned the steering wheel hand-over-hand to position the car for the entry onto the highway . There was a wait for an opening in the traffic . " Where do you intend to stay ? " " One of the hotels downtown . They 're all the same : I 'll call you when I get settled . " " I was thinking that you could stay with me . " She had been lookingover her shoulder at the passing cars ; now she turned to the front and floored the accelerator . The car reared back on its springs and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between cars . There was nothing silent about the motor now and Leland could feel the automatic transmission struggling under the sudden , immense strain . Then , almost as suddenly as it had begun , the acceleration eased and the transmission thumped into high , and the car cruised apparently peaceably in the traffic flow at a speed of fifty miles per hour . " There 's plenty of extra room at my house , " she said . " I 'll only have to pay a hotel bill . " " I 've invited my wife to come down for the weekend , " he said . " That is , of course , if I 'm still here myself . It was n't going to be on your time , but  --  " " Suppose we say that you 'll be my guest until Friday or when you 're done with the case , whichever comes first . " Her voice lowered . " I wo n't pay an unnecessary bill . " He was curious about when she had decided to do this , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . Remember what I said about getting an honest count . When I think we have all we 're going to get , I 'll tell you . I wo n't hang around . " " Then you do n't have much to tell me now , " she said . " I did n't say that . " He moved on the seat and took out his cigarettes . She was driving smoothly , staying in the right-hand lane . He could not remember the traffic ever having been so heavy . She seemed to know what she was doing . This car weighed five thousand pounds , more than a light truck , and it did not intimidate her . He might have expected this compulsory arrangement of staying at her home . When he had learned that she had left Manitou he had not called Karen again to tell her  --  it had seemed childish , and Karen really had been more upset over the prospect of coming to Port Smith herself  --  but now he wished he had called . They would be talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy . For them , talking long-distance was always bad . The line of cars slowed . Norma looked over her shoulder quickly  --  here it came again , that neck-wrenching acceleration  --  and she moved the car into the center lane . He wanted to begin with the souvenir book . She stopped him . She knew that five kills made an ace and what he had done ; howp307could he write in the note he had enclosed that he respected her husband 's record of two planes destroyed and two probables ? " You tried to make me think he did something special . I do n't understand that . " " He did do something special . Scores do n't mean much . The character of the war kept changing . It was n't possible to make a high score in Europe in 1945 . There was a lot of the luck of circumstance in what happened to me . The accounts say that your husband flew very well . There were men who ran away from the jets . He did n't . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best evidence available . It was gotten together when the events were fresh . We could go to Vineland for confirmation from Matthews , his wingman , but probably he would do what I did , go to the book . Unless we get something that contradicts what we have , we ought to leave it where it stands . " " I see . " He went on to the Manitou file , skimming over the way MacIver had bought his policies , the amounts , the kinds of insurance  --  all the things she had learned when she had made her claim . The changes of address verified what MacIver had told her about moving back and forth between Port Smith and Manitou . She had not known that he had made her the beneficiary of his insurance before their marriage . " He did the same thing with his first wife , " Leland said . " You can say that he was n't afraid to commit himself . " " Or that he was seeing that I got what he gave to her , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , it 's an act of love . The second , it 's a decision . Be honest . That 's the way it really is . " " That may be the way it was with him  --  we ca n't judge  --  but just as easily he could have forgotten what he had done with his first wife . It 's possible . The important thing for you to remember is that he married you after he had been burned once . What I learned this morning tells me that he loved you , loved you as he had never loved anybody . " " I do n't want to hear that now . " He had to let it pass.  | " I do n't think I ever want to hear it , " she said suddenly . " Maybe I 'll wonder about the might-have-beens , but I do n't think I 'll cry again . That 's over . I 've thought a lot about what I 've done by hiring you . In a way I ca n't explain , I 've begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have a right to some bitterness . He lied about who he was and he died without leaving a note to explain why . If I gave away the money , I would have my feelings straight . I 'd be bitter and nothing but . I 'm glad to have the money and that makes me feel guilty . " He stayed quiet . It was not just that a comment by him would upset her more ; he was sure she really did not want him to speak . He doubted that she believed everything she had said . She was too far into this to see what had moved her to do it . As a way of getting to MacIver 's mother , he said that MacIver had never named her as beneficiary to his insurance . He , Leland , had thought that curious until he had met Mrs. MacIver for himself . He described the home in Canby , exterior and interior , then its occupant . As well as he could , he transcribed the conversation that had taken place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back . " It did n't actually hit you , did it ? " she asked . " Oh , no . I would sue her if it had . I just want you to have an understanding of the person who thinks of you as that little Guin-ea. , " I never did hear what she thought of me  --  what she thought of the things Colin told her . " She looked at Leland . " Suppose she finds out about the baby and tries to take it from me ? If she had a smart lawyer , she could make a lot of trouble . " " I do n't think so . You have your Dr. Roberts and I 'll testify to what happened this morning . She 's a lot older than her years . Maybe even Murray Kaminsky would say that in court . In his estimation , she 's senile . " Now she saw that he was trying to direct the conversation . She asked about the way Betty Kaminsky lived . When she heard , she asked what her husband looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he 's my type . "  |p309He  regarded her . " That is n't an issue , is it ? " " In a way . I was jealous of her when Colin was alive , but because she was never a subject of conversation , my feelings did n't matter much  --  or I never had the opportunity to explore them . You can guess what I want to know now . " " If she was pretty , " he said . " That 's right . " " Norma , you know you 're an attractive woman . I wo n't lie to you , so is she , but you 're both such different types that I do n't think the question of looks was a concern to him . " " He told me that , " she said . " He told me he liked women who brought out the best in themselves . Once he pointed out a very dark Negro woman who was especially well groomed . It was something esthetic with him . He said he was drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to me , he said  --  which was purely an accident . I do n't have any insight into my appearance , how I look when I 'm walking and so forth , the way actresses do . But that 's what he meant . Fashions , types , hair colors  --  none of that mattered . What about Betty ? I want to hear about her . I do n't want to say her name , but I want to hear . " Leland had to continue with what Murray Kaminsky had told him . When he came to his impressions of Betty Kaminsky , he related them truthfully , carefully , skipping nothing . He told her of the red hair , the long legs , even the clear nail polish . She , did not interrupt him when he went on to tell of how well Betty Kaminsky had maneuveredher present husband . Leland repeated what she had said , withoutoffering his own opinion . When she had known McIver , she had stated very positively , he had been a coward and had never played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acquiredthe scar . There were the notations in the insurance file and Leland offered his explanation for the conflict . " Her distortion may be at the foundation of her marriage with Kaminsky  --  part of it , anyway . For his own sake , Kaminsky sees her as someone who suffered deeply . Perhaps it 's his way of living with her self-possession . She 's at the center of her world ; she makes no secret of it . She broke down today when she heard , but the truth is that before I told her ,  |p310she  said , Now what has he done ? ' As much as she 's capable of hating a person , she hates  --  hated  --  him for what he did to her  --  which amounts to not staying as interested in her as she is . " " So he went outside for what he needed , " Norma said . " It had to be something like that . I 've thought about it since I saw his picture in the book last night . He could have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't married when it came up , and probably he thought that I would n't take the chance with someone who had cheated . I even said to him once that I never cheated  --  slept with a married man . " She swallowed . " What I find so hard to understand now , " she said , " is why he wanted my love and took it as gladly as he did , but never tried to gain my understanding and trust . I would have understood , if he had told the truth . He just kept it from me . He did n't think I was a fool . He respected my intelligence . " She glanced at Leland . " He just never made use of it , " she said as she returned her eyes to the road . " So he cheated me , too . " " Did he ? " Leland asked . " In that sense , he did . What about the half-truths and lies about his mother 's relationship with Betty ? About his father and the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tell you , Joe , it 's not easy to face . " " Norma , all we really know is that he lied about his background . In most respects , it seems , he had reasons that had nothing to do with you . He had cut himself off from those people . Maybe he wanted to forget them as much as he could . " " Why did he lie about his father ? " " I do n't know . Possibly he saw him in those terms . His viewpointof him was different from ours , and not because he was the man 's son . They were equals in the ability to make money , or your husband was even his father 's better . We 're in awe of that ability , whether we admit it or not , and your husband saw it clearly . He understoodit , and saw beyond it to the man his father was . " She smiled . " You make an effective apologist for Colin . " " You 've forced me into the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still working on you . I want you top311take it easy and remember that we 're dealing with facts . The way your husband treated you all the time he knew you is a fact . Keep it in mind . The reports on him when he applied for his last insurance policies described him as a good husband . Your neighbors thought so and told the investigators that . He did n't cheat you and you know it . " She glanced away from the traffic again . " Those investigators ' reports do n't mean anything . A neighbor would n't undercut a man . " " If he had been doing something ugly behind your back that they knew about , they would . It happens more often than you think . They 'll say whatever comes into their minds . " He had remembered something . " For instance , one of them told of having seen him with approximately five thousand dollars in his pocket one Saturday morning . Did he do that often ? Carry that kind of money ? " She frowned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " He did it once . The man was n't lying or attempting to make your husband look bad . He gave him an excellent report . " She thought about it . The sky was a dark purple now and the headlights of the oncoming cars flashed through the windshield . She reached forward and moved a lever and almost immediately warm air began to pour from beneath the dashboard . The warmth and the car 's soft springing gave Leland a sense of insulation and lack of carQ . It occurred to him that he was learning his man in a way he could never measure . What he was doing now , sitting beside Norma as she drove , was something MacIver had done . Leland was not seeing it with MacIver 's eyes and he never would . It was a trick . MacIver was a set of things that had been . No one could guess what that set of things had seen and felt and thought  --  yet Leland could feel himself wanting to think that he could come close . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else I 've ever known . He carried his cash in his right hip pocket , folded once , without a clip or folder . When he bought something , he would take out all the money he had and count off . The singles were the outside and the larger bills at the center . He never used credit cards . You know when you play Monopoly , how people keep their money in severe little piles ? When he played , he put it in the same arrangement he had in his pocket , one big pile but without folding , small bills onp312top and big ones on the bottom . He never made a mistake or got confused . He treated real money as if it were Monopoly money , and vice versa . " " You have no explanation for the amount that man saw , " Leland said . " No . Is there any way to fix the date ? If it was a Saturday morning , the banks were closed . He was either carrying it from late the evening before or he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find out about it ? " " First I want to see if we have to . Think now . Could he have won it at the track ? " " Yes . Yes , if he had a really winning day . He liked to double up when he was ahead . But he would have told me if he 'd done that well . He always did . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes . He was like a baby when he had a big day . He wanted to spend it on me . Before we were married he had an eight-to-one shot come in and that night we spent almost a hundred on dinner and went to another place afterward , which was more . We spent a lot . " " How much did he have on it ? " " Five hundred  --  at eight to one . " " I should know more about this than I do , " Leland said . " I know the Internal Revenue Service ruling on racetrack winnings  --  " " Oh , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eight-to-one shot . He would n't let them take our picture at the nightclub . We 'd had it done on other occasions , but he did n't want any records of that night . " Leland kept quiet . He did not want her to think too much on how well her husband had known his way around that sector of life . If the Internal Revenue Service had suspicions of a man , it could easily turn up nightclub photographs as evidence of expenditures in excess of income . Most men  --  most tax dodgers  --  were ignorant of the depth to which the I.R.S. could research their finances . It had taken skill to get out of the track with the four thousand . MacIver knew more than the rudimentary elements of keeping his winning days in his pocket ; he meted it out in little bits and let no one makep313records . Now Leland said that the things she had told him and what he had heard from the Kaminskys made him think that MacIver would have been a poor choice for a player in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? He was , but he played to keep the others in the game . He made easy deals and carried the ones who were losing badly . Once he won a game when the rest of us realized that he had made a series of deals with all of us that left him invulnerableto rents . By just going around the board , he would eventually collect all the money . Listen , are we really going to learn anything ? I ca n't help feeling that we 're going to get so far , and then have to give up . His mother and that woman told you just part of what they know . It is n't fair . I have a right to know . " " You have a need to know , " Leland said . " We are n't done with them . " He told her what he had instructed Florence to do . " I want to know how he paid for his divorce so soon after finishing school , if he borrowed from his mother , and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the money . There are good questions about her finances . Did he support her before he died ? If he did , we 'll know that he was more involved with her than he let you know . Maybe he called her from his office . " " I do n't think so , " she said . " I think it was as he said . He did n't have anything to do with her . " " Did you look at his office telephone bills ? " " No . " " I will . " " Maybe he did borrow from her for the divorce , " she said . " That would explain why she was so against it and why she 's been friendly with Betty . " He did n't answer . He had steered her away from the night MacIverhad declined to be photographed spending money he had intended to conceal . Leland could n't help wondering himself , it was too interesting . As a public accountant MacIver had moved . in business circles and there was no telling how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . He had done his clients ' taxes  --  Mike did Leland 's and Karen 's  --  and the law was that the accountant was as responsible for errors as the man whose name appeared at the top of the form.  |p314Leland  sat up as he felt himself trying to move ahead and gather together what he had learned . Somehow MacIver had made his start and acquired the money for the divorce settlement . And from there , he had gone on to accumulate a quarter of a million . He could have been made a loan by his mother ; it supported the things Norma had just said about the mother 's attitude toward her son  --  but Leland did n't care about that ; MacIver had been an accountant , nothing more , and in five years and some months he had earned enough to save two hundred and thirty-two thousand dollars . No one had said that he had worked very hard . He had gone out , courted a second wife , married her , set up a new home . He had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have won all his money ; he would have been paying taxes on it right along or his estate would be tied up at this moment while back taxes were being determined . How MacIver had made his money and why he had died  --  if , indeed , his death had had anything to do with his money  --  remained as veiled as they had been yesterday when Norma had entered Leland 's office . Seeing it all in these terms , Leland could feel the despair of which she had spoken . They would get so close , and no more . They would have to give it up . Concerned with other issues , Leland hoped , Norma drove her late husband 's car with sureness and visible enjoyment across the county line into the city of Port Smith . The sky was black now , and the roads were still jammed with people going home to dinner . Port Smith was no place for the scant pleasures of late autumn . It was gray and damp in the days , and in the nights it became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned toes and fingers yellow-green for lack of circulation . Every patrolman in Port Smith knew the trick of ten deep breaths . The streets averaged six feet above the water table where the land was soft . Most of new Port Smith was mounted on a black glacier-scored rock , but that provided no better insulation against the weather . One of the results of the winter cold was that the people of Port Smith , a sophisticated and comfort-conscious lot , were hardier and less vulnerable than most Americans expected . At this point in his life , Leland both disliked and was concerned with this city : the cynicism that was the productp315of the sophistication and toughness was enough to keep the people from demanding a direction from the government , and the increase in the numbers of colored people , creating the division of rich from poor along the color line , was building a half-rational dissatisfaction that was now of subcrisis proportions Since the beginning of history cities had built on top of themselves , layer upon layer , and Port Smith was no exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood buildings whose construction no one remembered . Port Smith was rife with citizens ' committees , study groups , and action teams composed of people who had not taken part in civic affairs before . It was Leland 's own Port Smith upbringing that made him wish them well but made him wonderabout the sort of people who ran out nightly to meetings that accomplished nothing . That which he thought was most sane inside him considered those people and their meetings as the city 's best hope . Leland lived in Manitou now ; legitimately none of it was his business . That most sane thing inside him had to view his concern as only an extension of the satisfaction he felt when he read that Port Smith College won a baseball game or two in the course of a full season . Now Norma said , " What I ca n't understand is why he married her . " " That 's something we 'll never know . We 'd better just forget about it . " " He was young , " she said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed someone . " " Kaminsky told me that his wife thought that your husband was a terrific character . I took it to mean that he was impressive , polished , and mature . It was college , but she was twenty-two at the time . Maturity is something college women look for , I think . " " He was quiet , " she said vehemently . " Women mistake quietnessfor maturity . He could have been mature , yes , but he could have been lonely , too . " " Your Dr. Roberts is the one to see on that , " Leland said . " Are you angry with me ? "  | " You 're not waiting for the facts , Norma . Now we might just catch something on the state of his mind in those days . His wingman could give us some ideas , if all else fails . That 's something to think about for later on . In the meantime , stop thinking . Leave that to me . It 's what you hired me for . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , " she said . " What do you mean ? " " I 'm making myself sick over this . " " I would n't go that far , " he said . " Well , he 'll know by looking at me . He knows my moods and the things that go through my mind . Do n't be surprised if he asks me to go over to his place tonight  --  without you  --  for an hour . " He had picked up several things . " Then you 've made an appointment , " he said . " No , no . I talked to him this afternoon . We 're going to drop in on him right now . He has a class this evening , and he wanted to meet you as soon as he could . " He did n't answer . She seemed to have sprung it on him , as if she had thought that he would be displeased . Actually , he was . He wanted better warning . This made him think he was being drawn into something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company he enjoyed . A moment ago he had had to ask himself about the depth of her commitment to this Dr. Roberts . One thing he did not like was the idea of her surrendering her options so easily . If Roberts was to say she was sick  --  in trouble , more likely  --  she would accept it and offer herself up at the time he designated . For Leland there was something demeaning in it . It created a wariness of her he was not disposed to accept . Leland tried to turn himself to the fact that he was here on a job like any other , and the job was his man , Colin William MacIver , whose recent color photograph was firmly imprinted in Leland 's mind . The tall , slender , carefully dressed young man who had known the ins and outs , and now was dead . The most important single thing about his whole life was his sudden death , and Leland was havingp317difficulty keeping attention on it . He did not like it  --  or the way he was handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the radio , and she said no . She reached forward and pushed one of the buttons . They were climbing the hill behind Bay Slope and the lanes of traffic pulled upward before them for more than a mile . In the darkness of the boulevard he could see the aging frame houses in one of the oldest sections of Port Smith . It was a Negro neighborhood now , one and two steps up from the downtown ghetto . Where the houses were not owner-occupied , the managing agencies had them painted yellow and tan and dusty green . By some covenant in the real estate business , Negroes were to be prevented from living in white houses . Until the end of the war this part of the city had been a white area , then it had been busted , block by block , and millions had been made . When Leland 's father had toyed with the idea of buying his own home , he had looked here . It did not seem as if that could have been the 1930 's , so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change again . The banks would not extend credit to white men who wanted to live in a Negro neighborhood . The radio came on with the traffic report . The major arteries , including this one , were normal for the rush hour . There was an accident on the Northport Expressway and motorists were advised to use Central Avenue or Shore Boulevard as alternate routes . A jingle for a loan company came on as the boulevard tightened to four lanes divided by a narrow , treeless curb . The Cadillac stopped at a traffic light . The tailpipes of the crossing cars towed banners of steam . On the corner three people waited for the downtown bus , looking quite cold . As the light changed and the Cadillac charged forward , - engine sucking , hydraulic couple spinning , gears slickly shifting , the radio played a set of beeps and buzzes , followed by a very grave voice intoning that it was time for the news . " With the discovery this afternoon of the mutilated body of the little seven-year-old Mary Shoftel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times for James Scanlon , a sixty-eight-year-old drifter who roomed in the house whose basement gave up the little girl 's body at three-thirty P.M. today . Just minutesp318ago it was revealed by Detective Lieutenant David Schoenstein that Scanlon has been missing since the night Mary disappeared . Preliminarymedical examinations show that the girl had been sexually assaulted . She was found at Six forty-seven East Lincoln Street , six short blocks from her home , where her mother collapsed upon hearing of her discovery . She is in serious condition . Mary was found in the corner of the cellar , buried under rags and cardboard cartons in a makeshift grave  --  " Norma turned the radio off . " You do n't have to hear that , do you ? " " No , I do n't think so . " " It upsets me . I ca n't help it . I 'm very conscious of children these days . I do n't know what goes through a man 's mind when he does a thing like this . There are some things I can imagine  --  project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe it really is . When you were with the Police Department , did you ever work on one of these things ? " " I saw one . I saw a victim . " " A little girl ? A dead little girl ? " " That 's right . " " How can you live with it ? " " Watch your driving . " " I am . " " I ca n't , " he said . " I do n't . I do n't think about it . " " Can you do that ? " " Most of the time . " Her eyes were staying on the road . " Can I ask you something else ? " " Go ahead . " " Could you do it ? Physically . Could you keep it up ? " It had the intense shock of an unexpected slap across the face . She was maddening . He thought he should laugh , but he was too embarrassed . It was irrational , he knew it ; he knew he could expect anything from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't . " " I do n't want to believe that any man could , " she said . " This one did . "  | " Can you be sure ? The legal definition makes it rape if he just touches her with himself . I know that much . " " The report specified mutilation . In these cases that 's usually a euphemism for penetration . The newspapers will work around the details , but it may come out in the trial  --  if there is a trial . " " He must be insane , " she said . " He 'll never get to trial . " " Innocent until proven guilty , Norma . You can ask your Dr. Roberts about this , too . I 'd be interested in hearing his answers my-self . " The car was moving down Bay Slope toward the bay , which could not be seen because of the angling of the streets . It was not far to the Crescent Expressway , and from there , a few minutes to the Jefferson University campus . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leland said , and turned the radio on again . It was rude , but he wanted the opportunity to collect his thoughts . Collegeville Road had not changed since he had seen it last  --  which might have been before the war . The sorority house where he had met Karen was four blocks away , and he knew he could get out of the car and walk to the end of the street , make a half-left turn , and cut across the campus lawn to the dormitory where she had lived . He had never come back on a sentimental visit , and he did not know if Karen had , either . It would not surprise him if she had done it while she had lived here alone . Even in November the section was beautiful and restful , lawns , trees , and shrubs carefully tended , no fun for the children he had known in his own childhood . No children were in sight . In this neighborhood they were too jaded to play after dark . Where he had grown up the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a taste of that . He had to think of the gulf that was going to spread between Norma and her child . In neighborhoods like this the children took dancing lessons and had cats they bred and their own listed telephones . Leland could remember the street urchins around Franklin Pierce High School . He had a picture of little girls playing jacks by an apartment doorway . Norma 's child would never learn what jacks were . She parked the car in the drive and they walked past the front ofp320the house to a flagstone path that worked through the high shrub to the house next door . This house was larger , a two-story dark brick rectangle of no identifiable style , perhaps thirty years old . A light was on in the kitchen . Norma went up the steps , tapped twice on the glass of the new aluminum storm door , and turned the knob . Leland followed her through the double doors , then through a small pantry to the kitchen , where Wendell Roberts rose from the table , dabbingat his mouth with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him cheerily . " I was afraid we were going to get caught in the rush hour . " " I did n't expect to see you at all , " he said . He was a tall , longlimbedman , and he looked like the photograph Leland had seen . He reached across the table , almost past Norma , and took Leland 's hand . " Hi , I 'm Wendell Roberts . " He had a solid grip . " Joe Leland . Hiya . " " I thought I was going to make some introductions , " Norma said . She put her purse on the counter and brought a chair nearer the table . " I told you I was eager to meet him , " said Roberts . He pointed to another chair . " Sit down , Joe . I 'm just having a sandwich before class . Some coffee ? " Leland sat down . " No , thanks . I know you 're in a hurry . " Robertswas having milk with the sandwich , which looked like sliced turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like the first snow on a pavement . His skin still had a tan and he had the appearance of a man who spent every hunting season in the field , a gentleman sportsman . He knew it and completed the picture with a plaid tweed jacket with leather elbow patches . At first he seemed like a cheerful man who enjoyed life , but his eyes and the skin around them gave away a critical intelligence . His eyes had narrowed when he had looked at Leland in a nearly unconscious effort to take his measure , and the lines in the corners suggested to Leland that he did it very often . Now that Leland had made this observation about Roberts he wondered what observations Roberts had made about him . Leland felt himself becoming wary . Roberts said , " Well , the coffee 's there if you want it . This after/noon when Norma called I told her I could pick up enough turkey for all of us ; but she said it would give her heartburn . " " I guess we can believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Go ahead . I 'm sure you 've heard this , but I 've never met a private detective before . " Leland took an ash tray from Norma . " To tell you the truth , I do n't think I 've ever run into a psychiatrist . " " Not even when you were on the force down here ? " " Just psychologists . " " How 'd they strike you ? " He took a bite of his sandwich . " A little damp behind the ears . The pay was no good , so they were all kids . " Roberts nodded as he swallowed . " What you deserved . That 's not fair . They do good things . " " I never worked with them . On the way in from the airport Norma raised a question that I told her to put to you . " She looked surprised . She knew enough about him to realize he would not have spoken if he had not had a reason . He wanted to get out from under Roberts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news about the Shoftel killing . He said no . She told him the police had found the body and what its condition had been , and finally , that the police were looking for a man in his sixties who had disappeared the night after the girl had been taken from the sidewalk in front of her home . Roberts looked at Leland . " Do you think he did it ? " " I 'd like to talk to him . " " Nothing else ? " " I 'd have to see the evidence . " " That 's right , of course . " Roberts turned to Norma and a momentary glance back at Leland betrayed that he was thinking that he had not been answered . " I do n't know what I can tell you , sugar . The man could have a long history of this sort of thing . We 'll have to wait until they catch him . " " I see , " she said . She was dissatisfied , and so was Leland , who could have no complaint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in a man 's mind when he committed such a crime.  | " How have you made out so far ? " Roberts asked Leland . " We 've had progress , " he said . Roberts nodded . " I 've always been curious about how the police learn all the things they do . I remember that case of yours that was in the paper yesterday . Did you see the paper ? You knew what the roommate looked like before you found your witness . That was amazing . " That was a time we took a chance . " Roberts drank his milk . " Tell you what . I like to have a can of beer at night . Why do n't you join me ? Norma said she was going to ask you to use her guest room . " Leland 's mind was working . " Tonight is all right with me . " " Is ten o'clock too late ? " " No , I 'll see you then . " " Good . " Roberts got up to put his dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three inches tall , and he could not weigh more than one hundred seventy pounds . For a man in his fifties he was in excellent physical condition , straight-backed , rangy , and lithe . He had the quick , relaxed moves of a major league first baseman or a pro football end . Leland wondered about his vanity , how much he worked out , and why . " I 'm glad you two have hit it off , " Norma said . " There 's a fight on television tonight , anyway , " Leland said , trying to close the matter . Roberts had her under control . She had had to come over as soon as possible , for no good reason of her own . Roberts had wanted to arrange the meeting later . He was gentle with her and perhaps all Leland was seeing was a continuation of what she had needed at the funeral . He could not help having the feeling that the conversation was not going to be pleasant . Roberts certainly wanted it badly . He was doing his dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the plastic holder and wiped the crumbs from the table . The napkin went into a paper bag on the counter . She picked up her purse and faced Leland as Roberts turned off the taps and began to dry his hands . " Come on , honey , " she said to Leland , " we have to go . "  |p323Leland  felt it . He got up and opened the doors for her . He had to look back . Roberts , in the middle of the room , watched him with an unmistakable anger . The burden was on Leland to say something for which there were no easy words . By ten o'clock they might forget it , but the result , this impression , would not be changed . Roberts ' reaction could be too complicated for Leland to assess and act on  --  Roberts knew Norma better than Norma knew herself . It was another thing for Leland to keep in mind , in addition , obviously , to not speaking to her about what she had called him . " Flo , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have some packages here that have to get to Mike . I just called his home but he 's out . Is he working ? " " Not that I know of , Mr. Leland . We had a quiet afternoon . " " All right . Actually it 's a small truckload of stuff , boxes full of papers , ledgers , notebooks , some correspondence . I 've looked through it quickly and making sense of it will take a better-trained man than I am . Mike will have to study it item by item and draw up a written report . Tell him that I 've asked him to hurry . I do n't want to go into explanations , Flo , but I thought that it would be wise to get the stuff out of here tonight . I 'm waiting for a truck from a delivery service now . I do n't want it in the office , so it will be going to my apartment . Flo , can you see that it gets inside ? " " Of course , Mr. Leland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have to worry about him . Give him a twenty . Make sure that the place is locked up tight when you leave . If you want , spend the rest of the night there , because it 's going to be late when you 're done . There 's fresh linen in the closet . Tomorrow , tell Mike that he 's to use the apartment as he wishes to get the job done . He should n't take the stuff out . I want you to call Mrs. Walsh , my cleaning woman , and tell her that I do n't need her services on Thursday . You may have to call her for Monday , too . We 'll see . Do n't volunteer information to her . On the expense sheet , write yourself down for thirty dollars and the twenty for the driver . Mike goes on tomorrow at a hundred a day . Full time . You 'll have to run the office . Have we had any more upset stomachs ? "  | " No , we 're all right on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sit behind my desk for the duration . He can handle the people coming in . You show him how to keep things moving . Do the rest of it yourself ; I just want him there for the clients . " " I understand . " " Take good care of him , Flo . This job has to come first . " " How can we reach you ? " " I 'm staying at Mrs. MacIver 's . Do n't give her any messages , just that I should call you back . " " Is there anything else we can do ? " " No , " he said . " I 'll call you tomorrow afternoon . I 'm in a pay phone . That 's another thing . If I call you from the house , I 'll let you know . Do n't start telling me things . " " I understand . " " I 'll see you , Flo . " " Mr. Leland ? " " What is it ? " " I 'd like to stay at your place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her fiance . " Oh . Well , listen , I do n't want him looking at those papers . " " He wo n't . " " Flo , I 'd be pretty unhappy if you upset the place . " " I 'll clean up , I promise . Is there linen to change again ? " " Yes . Why did you tell me ? You could have had him up there without letting me know . " " You 'd find out somehow . I do n't want you thinking I 'm a sneak . You understand that I 'm not a baby . My mother does n't understandbut she 's been so far out of it for years that I do n't care about her . Don wants this and he 'd be angry with me if he got the idea that I let the chance go by . I 've been saying to him that I did n't want to go to a motel for the first time for a whole night , and we 've been talking about a weekend trip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nervous and that 's the one thing I do n't like . I like to be set and safe before I do a thing . " " I can understand that , Flo . Look , there 's a double lock on thep325door . Once the papers are inside , make sure you have the locks thrown  --  I want that  --  and then you do n't have to worry . It will be late and no one will call you . " " Now I 'm going to be nervous because it will be all right . " " Karen and I used to take a shower together . We were n't nervous , we did it to get our minds off school and so forth . There , now you know about us . " " I never thought about it and I wo n't start now . " " That 's the girl . Good night . " She said thank you and good night and he hung up to wait for the operator to call back with the charges . He was in the corridor outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had needed coins for the call , and in this quiet neighborhoodhe had had to walk here , about a third of a mile , to get two dollars changed . Making the call outside was a normal precaution , he had told Norma , but in fact he had acted because of what he had seen of the contents of the cartons he was sending to Manitou . Pulling them out of the crawl space of the garage where she had put them in August , he had seen that they amounted to something different from the usual paraphernalia of accountants . Mixed with the letters , bills , and acknowledgments were canceled checks drawn by MacIver for very large sums , and in some of the ledgers and notebooks were entries that seemed like nonsense , or even madness . The figures did n't add , and in one ledger where Leland tried it , the columns did n't balance . In three of the books was a word that appeared on nearly every page , " Rainbow . " " Rainbow  --  57,264 " was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a record of the listings of certain stocks on the New York and American exchanges . A look in the back newspapers would show if it was accurate . A miniature looseleaf notebook was full of plus and minus figures , dated . Leland was certain that this book related to MacIver 's gambling , but it showed nothing in line with MacIver 's rise in fortune . In a two-month period in the spring of last year , MacIver had lost seven thousand dollars . Norma had broiled a steak for their dinner , and after she had finished cleaning the kitchen she had gone out to the garage where shep326had found him sitting behind the wheel of the convertible , looking at a handful of the papers . He told her that he could make out even less than he really did understand , and that he had to send it all to his office . It was her property and he could not stop her from looking at it , but when she did not try to see what it was , he was relieved . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she understood " Rainbow . " MacIver 's marriage with her was beginning to come up in a different light . He had kept so much of himself from her that Lelandwas tempted to think that he had been using her . But why ? As much as Leland liked her , he had to see that she was not much of a display . She had said that she and MacIver had made love every night . Still , the deeper into the nature of their relationship Leland found himself , the less he liked it , the less was his desire for learning more . He walked back across the campus to Collegeville Road . The panel truck from the delivery service arrived just before ten . At ten exactly , Dr. Roberts came around to the front of the house . The truck was backed up the drive and the lights from the house and the garage gave a poor illumination to work by . As Leland came out of the garage with one of the cartons he saw that Roberts had buttoneda sweater over his shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perspiring , felt cold , and the air was biting the backs of his hands where the weather had made them raw . " I 'll be with you in a minute , Doctor , " he called . " You 're really going at it , " Roberts said . Leland kept working . " Time is money . " " That 's what he told me , " said Norma . She stepped out of the shadows . She smiled to Leland , who waited at the truck for the driver to bring up the last carton . " My money . This way , his partner will be looking at this first thing tomorrow morning . " " I see , " Roberts said . He did n't like it , which brought him up even with Leland , who had not wanted him to know so much about this . Leland walked with the driver to the front of the truck . Roberts did not have to know where in Manitou the papers were going . Leland paid the driver and apologized for asking him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his tip . The driver said all right and got behind the wheel.  | " Listen , " Leland said . " Be careful . " " I do n't want to hear it , " the driver said . " I never talked to you. , , " If you stop for coffee , lock the truck . " " I did n't load it , " the driver said . " I do n't have the key . " " You wo n't have trouble , but if you run out of cigarettes orswallow your chewing gum , call me . Call me collect , but call me . " " You 'll hear , all right , " the driver said , and turned the key . " Iwo n't need a telephone , either . " Leland walked back to the garage . " Do you think you 'll learn anything from those books ? " Dr.Roberts asked . " We 'll learn if there 's anything to be learned , " Leland said . The truck reached the street and they watched it go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , then the truck turned and disappeared . Leland found himself hoping that Mike would not fail him . " You 're going to catch a cold , " Norma said . " You , too , " she said to Roberts . She pushed the button that lowered the garage door . " I have coffee ready , " she said . " Thanks , honey , " Roberts said , " but I 'm looking forward to that beer . " " I 'll leave the kitchen light on for you , Joe , " she said . " I wo n't be long , " he said , more to Roberts . He waited with Roberts until she was inside , then they started across the lawn toward the break in the hedge . " I 'm glad that you took this case , Joe , " Roberts said . " I 'm glad to hear you say that , Doctor . " " Call me Wendell , please . Do you want a shot ? A shot would warm you up . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to hear that again . " They entered the house . " Give me your coat . We 'll go into the study . " Leland followed him . " For the most part , the house is closed . My wife passed on a few years ago . " " I 'm sorry , " Leland said . He wanted to conserve what he knew , but at the same time he could not allow himself to be caught in a lie.  |p328If  he had said , " I 'm sorry to hear it , " he would be lying and , eventually , caught . The memory of the failure with MacIver 's mother was still fresh in Leland 's mind . As he followed Roberts to the study , he thought that he was going to let Roberts keep the lead  --  he had wanted this , he had something to say . Roberts certainly had other things to offer the case , and Leland could lose his chance with the wrong words . The study was on the other side of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smaller but higher than the living room in Leland 's apartment . It was furnished with castoffs and handme-downs , a leather couch and a pair of lounge chairs , bookcases and a desk as huge as Napoleon 's tomb . There were signed photographs on the walls and a small refrigerator behind the door . " I could n't see throwing it out when we replaced it , " Roberts said . " I do n't like beer all this much . As old as it is , the box located here is a very prestigious item . Sit down . " He took off his sweater and put it carefully over a chair . He opened his collar . " You 're married , are n't you ? " " Oh , yes . " " It 's worth the effort . I 'm the one to tell you . " " How so ? " " With my wife dead , I 'm a pretty lonely man . " He brought over a tray . " Listen , Joe , I wanted to talk to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled by the poor-widower routine . " Cheers , " Roberts said . " Here 's looking at you . " He pointed toward the couch for Leland , and leaned against the edge of the desk and folded his arms . " You heard what Norma called you this evening . I 'm quite fond of her and she 's had a rough time . I 'd appreciate it if you would keep that in mind . If the situation gets out of hand , you 'd do well to  --  take the action your conscience tells you to . " Delicately put , " he said . " Damn it , Joe , it is delicate . She has had a rough time , and if she can weather the next few months , she 'll have a good chance at life . " " We had a conversation yesterday at lunch , " Leland said , mak/ing himself comfortable . " She told me that she was your patient once  --  and why . I 'm not going to con you . I like her . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped to light a cigarette "  --  but I know mine . She 's my client , and as long as I think I have a case , I report to her . " " Joe , that can mean anything . " " That 's up to you . I need all the help I can get . " " I know you  --  your war record . I thought that I 'd see a little more cooperation . " " Are you going to cooperate with me ? " " In what ways ? " Roberts asked . " Was MacIver your patient ? " " No . " " In your conversations with him , was there anything that made you believe that he would try to take his life ? " " Did he talk to you about his marriage ? " " Not really . I would ask how Norma was , and he would say fine or something like that . " " Did he talk to you about his gambling ? " " No . " " Business ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived here , you never had protracted or important conversations ? " " We were both busy . Once in a while he would come over , as you have , for a beer . We would watch television or talk sports or politics . Very casually . " " What were his politics ? " " They 're difficult to put into words . He hated bureaucracy and big government . He was a conservative , but he did n't think there was any genuine conservative philosophy in this country . He despised McCarthy . He was too smart to believe that the people in government did n't know what they were doing . He saw the defense effort as so much make-work , and he was sure that it was the same with the Russians , too . He was unhappy and discouraged , frankly , over thep330way things were going . He thought that it was corrupt and very dangerous . " " You 'd say that he had a keenly developed moral sense , in that case . " Roberts looked surprised . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was he moral in his private life , too ? " " Oh , yes . I 'd say that was true , yes . Everything that he showed me indicated that . " It was occurring to Roberts that his questioner knew more than he was letting on . Leland 's knowledge of the conversation about the cost of psychiatry at their first meeting was a low trump to hold , but as long as Roberts did not know he held it , Leland was safe while he tried to read through Roberts ' lies . This stuff about sports and politics was ridiculous . Leland took a swallow of beer . " What do you know about Rainbow ? " " Rainbow ? " He looked surprised again . " What is it ? " " I 'll find out . " Leland drank some more . " What are Norma 's politics , by the way ? " " That 's the amusing thing , " Roberts said . " She 's a gut-liberal . The poor are important to her . " Leland nodded . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " he said . Half the truth . He had asked while his mind moved on to something else and at the same time absorbed the idea that Roberts knew about Rainbow . He said , " You went with Norma to the coroner 's inquest . Did n't it strike you as odd that it would be over before you got there ? " Roberts rocked forward . " Well , yes . I had thought that they would want to take testimony from her about the state of his health . A clerk told us that the prima-facie evidence establishing the mode of death had been enough for the coroner  --  he was n't interested in Colin 's various conditions . " " Clausen is still a relatively poor county , " Leland said . " There is n't much money for the coroner to spend . " " I suppose that enters into it , " Roberts said . He wiped his handp331over his scalp . " Norma felt that she had been short-changed . I 'd say that if she had n't had that feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your plans now ? She told me that you 've already seen his mother and his first wife . " " I have some ideas , " Leland said , annoyed with this new breach of security . " Joe , I thought that we were going to cooperate with each other . " " We are , Wendell . But I do n't feel that it 's ethical to clear my moves with you . " " Then you put me over a barrel just now . I submitted to your questions . " " If you had n't , I 'd have told Norma straightaway . " " Do you think I 'd have held anything back from her all this time ? " " Frankly , I do n't know . " " You 're a hell of a suspicious man , " Roberts said . " Not at all . On the basis of what you 've said about your concern for her , you could want to shield her from some things you might happen to know . " " Then you 've found evidence from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I did n't say that . Wendell , I 've been hired to do a job , and since my employer is your friend , I would think that you would share her confidence in me . " " All I want are assurances , Joe . " " Assurances against what ? That 's what I do n't understand . " Roberts raised his arms up toward the ceiling , and Leland could n't blame him . It was a stupid question . Now the telephone rang . Roberts reached for it on the desk behind him and said hello . Leland paid attention to his beer . " No , " Roberts said , " you 're not interrupting anything . . . of course . " As Leland glanced up he caught Roberts taking a quick look at him . Roberts turned away before Leland had a chance to recover . As Leland drank his beer down to the bottom of the glass he weighed the expression he had seen : Roberts had looked annoyed , as ifp332Leland was a pest who had invited himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to hear from you and I told you why this afternoon . " Leland did not look now . It was the conversation of a man who did not want to be understood . " Just a minute , " Roberts said into the telephone , and put the receiver down . " Joe , I want to take this in the kitchen , if you do n't mind . " " Go ahead . " " Take another beer , if you like . " " Thanks , I will . " Carefully , Roberts shut the door behind him . It made no sense ; if Leland wanted to hear , he had only to pick up the receiver . Or perhaps that was the trick . Roberts could be waiting right outside  --  why , Leland could not guess . Nearly everything Roberts had done so far had not made perfect sense . Who was on the telephonenow ? Norma ? That would be worth knowing . Leland was on his feet . So far , all right ; if Roberts mistimed and barged in , Leland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leland fixed the location of the receiver on the desk . Now he picked it up and listened . " If anything , it 's worse now , " a woman said . " The situation is out of control . I know what he 's trying to do and I wo n't put up with it . . . " Very quietly Leland put the receiver down . It sounded right . He went for the beer . The legitimacy of the call did not change what Leland had thought . There was something wrong with Roberts ' behavior . ProbablyMacIver had discussed Rainbow with him  --  there was nothing the matter with that even if Rainbow was something to hide . If Robertshad been treating MacIver and MacIver had killed himself , Robertswould not have let Norma work into her present state . Leland would not be here . If Roberts was more deeply involved , he could have dissuaded her from this ; but she had said that Roberts had encouraged her . At the moment there was nothing to do but wait . The shelves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles . It seemed as if the authors had responded to a common urge to minimize the titillation of the subject matter , and one of the results was that a word like " Psychosexuality , " set inp333narrow , archaic type on a binding of nubby black cloth , looked deadly dull . With the fresh glass of beer in hand , Leland gladly moved down the wall toward the framed photographs . They were the usual unconsciously incredibly-funny posed shots of people at banquets and giving and accepting awards . Roberts photographed very well . He was , of course , in all of the pictures . Their mounting was not a display of exceptionally naive vanity ; none of them was less than four years old and all bore identifications in white lettering done in a distinctively feminine hand . Leland picked out the late Mrs. Roberts in one of the award-presentation pictures . She had been a tall , mature , and handsome blonde  --  real blonde , with very fair skin and eyes so blue they hardly registered on the film . In all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or suits with small pieces of costume jewelry ; but Leland was thinking of the story Norma had told him about Maine and Mrs. Roberts slipping and grabbing her husband 's arm , and Leland was picturing her as she must have looked on that day , in slacks , say , and a long-sleeved blouse . She had been one of those full-figured women who were a revelation of sexuality when they put on closely fitting casual clothes . Feeling a genuine sadness increasing , Leland walked away . There were more framed photographs by the door , men in dinner jackets . Roberts with other doctors , Roberts with a pair of priests , Robertswith , surprisingly , Leland 's old friend , Herbert A. Davis . Below that was another picture of Roberts , Davis , and a gaggle of doctors and businessmen , and this one was identified as a downtown health council . On a table was a poster depicting what seemed like apartmentbuildings . The last picture in the row was an autographed portrait of Herbert A. Davis . Leland grinned . A head of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not Davis . Now , at the desk , was a very small click , Roberts hanging up the extension . Leland decided to wait where he was , to let Roberts know that he had been snooping . He would leave it to Roberts to wonder how much had been learned . He came in . " Oh . All set up , I see . That was one of my patients . Did you listen in ? "  |p334Leland  laughed . " I thought of it . " " I was hoping you would . Sit down , sit down . " He pulled the chair around from behind the desk to face the corner Leland had taken on the couch . Roberts sat with his elbows on his knees , the long fingers of both hands curled around his glass of beer . " I do n't mean to say I planned it , it 's just that as I was going out it occurred to me that the receiver was there for you , and you might hear something that would help you understand what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work Leland over , and now Leland thought that it was time to hit back , even if he had to hurt , to let Roberts know that he did not have an easy mark . " I thought I 'd learn more about you if I looked at your pictures . I was able to pick out your wife . She was a handsome woman and I 'm sorry she 's gone . " " She put up the pictures , " Roberts said . If he knew what Leland was doing , he was not showing it . " She was very proud of me . We met and married late , but she did n't take any of these things for granted . " He looked to the pictures . " She was proud to be my wife . There 's no other way to say it . " " My wife has kept a scrapbook for years , " Leland said . He sipped his beer . " What was it ? " " Oh . A heart attack . She did n't wake up one Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had no warning . I knew something was wrong the moment I opened my eyes . She always responded to the alarm and then woke me , but she was just lying there . I sat up and saw that her bladder had relaxed  --  that should n't shock a policeman  --  so I kissed her , twice , carefully , and called the police . My wife is dead . I just woke up and my wife is dead . ' That 's what I told them , and of course I was crying . You 'd expect that I 'd have done better , with my training . " " I am sorry . " Roberts took a drink of beer . " I 've been living like a convict since that day . Get up and go to work , come back and go to bed . A few social obligations , but with no more enthusiasm than some of these men in prison must take to the weekly movies . " I think it 's over now , " he said . " I had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face how much I allowed it to change my life . That was natural . Colin 's death snapped me out of it . That 's natural , too . I liked him . He was a quiet sort of young man . He minded his own business and seemed to want other people to mind theirs . He did n't have close friends  --  no bowling team or poker croniesor anything like that . Maybe he did n't think as much of himself as he should have . I do n't know , I 'm only guessing . He never did say anything that could lead me to offer that to you as a professional opinion . He loved his wife desperately . Maybe you know that he had a certain amount of personal aloofness . I never saw him touch her affectionately in the two years  --  more  --  that I knew him . But he provided for her lavishly . It was the way he was . You 're seeing it all for yourself . He made her happy . The most of what I know about him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect he had on her . She 's not a beauty , but she 's an easy woman to fall in love with  --  all the men who know her are a little in love with her  --  but she 's not easy to please . She thinks she is , but she needs an enormous measure of loving , just affection , to keep her opinion of herself high enough to keep her going . She needs a man to keep her related to life . That 's not to say that she 'll die if she does n't have one , but she 'll run down , slowly , like an eight-day clock . By saying that the men who know her are a little in love with her , I mean that they would sleep with her if they could . Her want to be loved seems to hold out that kind of promise . As they get to know her better , they only wish that she were that simple . " He finished his beer . " Want another ? " Leland held up his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refrigerator . " What did she tell you about herself ? I know your communications with her are privileged , but I do wish you 'd sketch in what she said . I have a reason for asking . " He returned to his chair . Leland said that she had told him about her past and her courtship with Macfver . " The rest of it concernedcircumstances of his death . You know them as well as she does . " " Yes , yes , that 's right . " He took a swallow from the freshly filled glass . " I was hoping you 'd listen in on that call so you 'd get a feel for the kind of thing I do  --  so that if I said I went throughp336approximately the same process with Norma , you 'd be able to accept that with little difficulty . " " You figured prominently in her account of herself , Wendell . She told me about the way her therapy went . " " Did she give you any idea of the things she 's susceptible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far into my own privileged communications , but I want to be sure you have an appreciation of how much of a touch-and-go situation this really is . " Leland smiled . " I 'm not going to give you any help , Wendell . I 'm going to make you say it . " " Joe , I 'm not playing a game . " " No , you 're not . " He drank some beer and looked away . " All right , yesterday she went with that heavyset fellow , what'shis-name , Miller , to Manitou to see you . You got rid of Miller for her and the two of you went to lunch . You had a long conversation . She checked into a hotel and that was the last you saw of her until she met you this evening . Do you know what she did when she got settled in the hotel room ? " He waited . " She called me . She was on air . She did n't want to talk for long because of the long-distance charges , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and that you had been interested in what she had had to say . She was very impressed with you . That was at twothirtyyesterday . " Leland was beginning to dislike this intensely . Roberts said , " She called me again today before noon . Her emotionalstate was as low as it had been high yesterday . It was n't just the discovery that her husband had lied to her . The conversation with you at lunch had become important to her . You did n't seem to show the same interest that you had . In her words , she felt nervous . " " So you told her to take the train home . " " No , I told her to do what she wanted to do . Now I 'll tell you why I did . Joe , I wish I could say that she 's on a tightrope , and that as soon as the baby is born and she adjusts to what is required of her , she 'll be safe . I ca n't . She 's not as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Colin died , her life had had an almost perfect resolv/ing . She worked very hard to get away from a world of superstition and violence . Her family is far behind her now . They 're in awe of her when they come here and see how easily she lives with what they can never have . Marrying Colin MacIver was a kind of reward for that effort  --  in her mind . She was quite up to him when they met . She dated one of my colleagues earlier that same year  --  he ca n't forget her . He 's not in the city now ; when he heard about Colin 's death , he called me and asked if he could help by coming east . In some ways she 's a brilliant girl . The tests she took at the clinic placed her in the top two percent of all scores , and she would score even higher now because of her better situation . Some people would never believe it of her . I heard that one woman called her slow-witted . Norma is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're better than she is . She knows it , she knows that the feeling is part  --  just part  --  of the myth and superstition of poverty . She wishes she could sparkle , like some women , and she knows she never will . It 's not a happy thing for a young woman to live with . " For this and a lot of other reasons I have no right to discuss with you , Norma functions best in one-to-one relationships . She does well with each of us , but did you notice earlier in the kitchen when we were all together that she had nothing to say ? " " I see what you mean . " He wanted another beer , but decided against it . He put the empty glass on the table beside the couch . Roberts cleared his throat . " Joe , I want you to take another objective look at her situation . You must have done it yesterday when you decided to take this job . She was happily married , expecting a baby . Her husband died suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities say so . She has to be wondering how this - reflects on her in the one area in which she can take justifiable pride . She 's a hell of a woman for a man . He left no note , no explanations . Since last August she 's been searching for an answer . Suppose you find none ? You 've already found something that was terribly upsettingto her . You 're an attractive man  --  you are to her . She has you to her house , has you working for her , relating to her . She told me that you 're separated from your wife . Any woman would mark you as fair game . Her feeling for Colin MacIver is dying . It had to if she 's top338survive . He killed himself . He willfully concealed things from her . The more you uncover about him  --  the worse you make him look  --  the more you will enhance yourself . In all frankness , Joe , she 's been looking for someone to displace him . That 's been part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You could get up from here and go next door and be sleeping with her within the hour , and it would be no real accomplishment . She 's not promiscuous . No matter what she told you , she never has been . She and I ca n't have a **25;7276;TOOLONG anymore , but she does come over to see me . On one level she 's killing something inside her that has to die , and on another she 's very , very afraid to let it go . Being pregnant has helped her . A baby is a baby to her and she 's not capable of thinking of it as Colin 's or even her own . She would feel the same about it if it had to come by parcel post . Carrying it , the expectancy of having it , has helped her get through the worst of this . The rest she has to fight . Her friends can only give her assistance . " " You want to know where I stand , " Leland said . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her in a way her friends can not . " " I think I understand you now . Crudely put , you want me to stay within a set of rules . I 'll tell you what I told her yesterday when I took this case . I 'm going to stay with it as long as I can see a reasonable return on her investment . When that stops , so do I. I go home . If she wants to think of other things , that 's her business  --  and yours , if you want to concern yourself . " He saw Roberts tensing . " Wait until I 'm finished . " I have my own professional ethics to uphold  --  and the law . I do my job and give the reports to her . If I turn up evidence of a crime , I 'm obligated to report it to the authorities . She was advised of that yesterday and in my opinion she understood it perfectly . She 's not a baby . If she 's thinking other things  --  and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the range of normal experience . She can handle them . " " Joe  --  " " I said wait . I wo n't attempt to suggest that I know her better than you do , but I will say one thing : I saw her yesterday when youp339were n't around , a condition you could n't duplicate , and she did well enough to get by . I know she was quiet this evening in your kitchen , but there were other factors at work there . You wanted to set this up and I wanted to see what you were all about . She was eager to have us talk to each other . It was almost her place to step aside . We even overran her chance to introduce us . We took the chance away from her . " And why do you want to fool around ? We both heard her call me honey . ' You were n't afraid to mention that , were you ? You take another objective look , Wendell . The reason I 'm here at all is Colin MacIver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to you , just as she brought him to you three years ago . She wanted us to get along in the same way . The circumstances were the same , dinner and conversation  --  and even the conversations had a similarity . Did n't they ? Do n't fox around . I saw the expression on your face as we were going out . " " You 've given it a lot of thought . You have a very convincing argument , even if you are wrong . " " I 'm not arguing with you , Wendell . Fm not making any deals and there wo n't be any rules . My relationship with my client is my business and hers , and if she wants to discuss it with you , that 's up to her . I 'm going to advise her not to do it . You 're interfering right now , impeding my progress and wasting her money . You can explain that to her , if you want . Just continue to follow this course and I 'll tell her everything you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she could n't help wondering what you really thought of her . And if she had real troubles and you tried to help , she just might tell you to get lost . " You see , Wendell , by your own admission your relationship with her is on shaky ground . She told me that you 've tried to watch her pretty closely since the doctor-patient business deteriorated . I know that you 're fond of her and she has a genuine love for you , but maybe you 've tried to have it both ways . She was a different person around you this evening . She was wound up and maybe a little too cheerful . Are you sure you 're not just saying you 're her friend and still trying to be the doctor ? Maybe she 's been waiting for the gifts
