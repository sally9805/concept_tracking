txt I00 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT print media from television networks has already constituted a new departure in news reporting . Fred Friendly , then President of CBS News , called it " a milestone in American journalism . " The sampling procedures developed by the networks have become too expensive for even the largest single newspapers to duplicate . The Documentary The documentary program is a relative newcomer to network schedules . During network television 's first decade , the format was considered too specialized in its appeal to be able to attract a mass audience , which may be only a way of saying assemblers of documentaries did n't know how to do them well . The few documentaries attempted tended to prove both points . In those days , a documentary in competition with a program of pure entertainment almost always showed a discouraging rating . Sponsors , anxious to reach large audiences , considered the documentary a poor investment . The sponsors changed their opinions before the public did . By the end of 196o , there was considerable evidence of increased advertiser support for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the documentary as an important format . Both of those decisions required much courage and foresight in the light of the previous undistinguished record in this kind of programming . The first decision was to increase documentary budgets to permit more time , personnel and facilities to be devoted to their preparation . As a result , a type of program once dull and one-dimensional in its scope became exciting and as broad in treatment as it was possible to make it . Documentaries began to appear regularly in prime-time evening schedules . While their ratings still did not compare in size with the popular entertainment offerings , the size of their audiences showed as much relative growth as other kinds of programs . The second network decision was to deal with certain controversial subjects previously judged too risky for presentation on national television . As a result , documentary units of the networks broke barriers of public sensitivity on various topics by bringing analyses into the open . Some of the subjects examined on the air by network documentary units included : integration , poverty , urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menopause , the population explosion , birth control , the bookies , the problems of adoption , the traffic in drugs , juvenile delinquency , abortion , cigarette smoking and cancer , and divorce . International issues were treated , including such problems as the Cuban crisis , the Berlin wall , the conflict between India and Red China , the Panama revolt , revolutions in South America and the Mil Last , the Kremlin , the Viet Nam and I.aos situations , the common market and the emerging nations of Africa . Not all the documentaries dealt with serious subjects but Television Programming iot even the lighter ones were used to inform , to broaden understanding and to stimulate thought . Some representative subjects of this type were : the decline of royalty , the American woman , the festival frenzy , the circus , the decade of the twenties and American humor . A key factor in the success story of the network news and documentary units has been their insistence on independence from sponsor control . No other network program group has been so divorced from the advertiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial subjects . I n a few cases , there have been threats of cancellation . In most instances , the networks have backed their documentary producers and have announced that the programs would be shown over their facilities with or without sponsorship . They usually have had sponsorship . In spite of an increased emphasis on news and public affairs by the networks , the problem of securing the cooperation of affiliates was and is most difficult . Two programs that became Peabody Award winners in 1965 were refused by many affiliated stations when they were broadcast by the networks . Profiles in Courage was not seen on twenty per cent of NBC 's outlets ; CBS Reports was refused by forty-five per cent of the network 's stations . " A study in the Spring of 1966 , showed that substantial numbers of network-aililiated stations had not carried news programs on the war in Viet Nam . " Specials on February 12 of that year were broadcast by forty-two per cent of the CBS stations and thirty per cent of the NBC stations . Fewer than half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while sixty-five per cent of the NBC stations carried a similar special the same evening . The study found that sponsored evening newscasts may count upon affiliate acceptance but single , weekly public affairs programs are likely to be rejected or else carried on a delayed basis by a high proportion of stations . It may be more profitable for the local station manager to schedule a local commercial showing of syndicated film in place of a network public affairs program , but it is a burdensome expense for the networks to develop these excellent offerings and the cooperation of affiliates in carrying them should be little enough to ask . It would seem proper for local stations to realize the changing nature of their medium . The refusal of sizeable numbers of affiliates to carry public affairs programs from the networks may be a decisive factor in the reduction of the frequency of these offerings . George Norton , advertising vice president of General Telephone and Electronics , advances a demographic reason of great cogency : Our research shows that news-documentary programs reach 27 per cent more professional and white-collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one or more years of college , 2 I per cent more in the upper-income group . ' ' IO2 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT NETWORK FILM PROGRAMS Films were little used in early network programming . Television was a new medium that seemed to demand live production . Old feature movies and varied short subjects hardly seemed appropriate , especially when they were re-runs of materials produced by and for a competitive form of show business . Policy changes on the use of film were made after Hollywood began to produce and syndicate programming especially for television . Actually , the local television stations were first to schedule the bulk of the new availabilities . Then the networks began to see possibilities in the Hollywood product . By 1959 , they were the primary markets for West Coast film production and before long most of the network schedule consisted of filmed programming . By the 1965 ? 66 season , almost eighty-five per cent of the prime-time programming of the three networks was on film . As recently as the 1962 ? 63 season , the percentage had been around seventy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action and adventure series and the situation comedies . Most of the prime time variety and the quiz or panel programs were on tape . It became difficult for local stations to find syndicated film series which had not already been shown by the networks . Almost twice as many off-network series were offered to stations in 1966 as were made available the previous year . Since most of them were in black and white , the increase in offerings may be attributed to a race against obsolescence as color programming comes more into demand . The pace of film production changed considerably when the film companies became major producers for television . Previously accustomed to as much as a year and a half for the completion of a feature film for theater exhibition , film makers now find themselves turning out two half-hour films every week . There are certain advantages to the film producer in selling his film to a network rather than to individual stations . He can recover his production costs sooner , his distribution costs are lowered , far fewer prints of the film are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually absorbed by the networks . Even with these advantages , the creation of a pilot film for a prospective series is a heavy risk . The cost of pilots , due largely to contract restrictions on talent and to overtime payments , runs considerably higher than the costs of subsequent programs in a series once it is sold . The investment in a half-hour pilot averages around $200,000 . An hour pilot , usually involving on-location shooting , can cost well over $400,000 . Some twenty pilots that are created each year are not accepted by the networks . It should be understandable why many independent producers hesitate to invest such a sizeable amount of capital on a highly speculative // risk . It should also be clear why so many producers who enter this competition tend to play it as safely as possible by developing programs similar in nature to those which have already been successful . On the positive side , once a pilot is accepted , there are the prospects of sale of the remainder of the programs in a series , the possibilities of network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the foreign market . The growing dependence of the networks on the Hollywood production centers may lead to future problems . Increasing costs of turning out pilots on speculation and the high mortality rate of those products after they are accepted could have the effect of drying up a major program source . The signs are pointing to a need for a renewed emphasis on live programming by the networks . Videotape has not , as yet , replaced film as a key source of programming due to its inflexibility in use . Producers , as well as talent , have come to rely on editing privileges before final approval of their product . Videotape is more difficult to edit than film and considerably more expensive ; yet , further ease and facility of editing is but a short time removed . During the 1966 ? 67 season , feature films were on the networks on six nights of each week . This brought the proportion of total network prime time devoted to feature films to well over fifteen per cent . Television is consuming features faster than the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backlog of Hollywood features dropped from 2,200 in 1961 to 875 in 1965.5 If each network series needs thirty new features each year ( assuming that two-thirds of them will be re-run ) , then six series will need i 80 . The total output of Hollywood feature production is now only some 130 to 150 features a year . Many can not be shown on television . However , since viewers seem responsive no matter what film is shown , network financing of features made especially for television may be expected to increase . THE COSTS OF NETWORK PROGRAMMING The programs of the three networks in the prime nighttime hours alone cost millions of dollars every week . For the advertiser , the cost of a program is only a part of his total expense ; the value of the time and the charges for network facilities must be added . Time and facilities charges vary with the time of day , the length of the contract , the number of stations on which the program is carried and other variables . The charges for prime time on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern in this section is not with time and facilities charges but with the costs of various kinds of programs and the effect of these costs on program decisions . As a potential sponsor , the reader may ask himself whether he would rather buy an hour of Lawrence Welk at around $75,000 or CBS Reports BROADCAST MANAGEMENT figure of some $175,000 , or whether he would prefer to sponsor one of op hour-long variety programs at a cost of $175,000 to $200,000 . If ratings were comparable , the less expensive series might at first appear the better purchase . However , there are other variables to consider , as the demographic characteristics of the audiences reached , the type rogram in relation to the type of advertising , the competition on the r networks at the same hour and the prestige values of the program for advertiser . The ideal program purchase for any advertiser is the series that comes the lowest budget yet delivers the most people with the demographic acteristics the advertiser wishes to reach . This is no easy determination . this challenge to discover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such exciting work . Network programming costs have risen steadily over a five-year period aging about six per cent higher each year . Color telecasting itself calls ncreasing expenditures for film , photography , sets , lighting , locations costumes . Nine significant additional factors causing network program costs to ease are : " ( r ) TV 's phenomenal success , which has enabled it to pay e and its suppliers to demand ? and get ? more ; ( 2 ) the demand for insed production values ; ( 3 ) unions ; ( 4 ) the changing economics of ramming , and especially the change in the syndication market ; ( 5 ) it agents ; ( 6 ) residuals ; ( 7 ) the increased reliance on film product , darily Hollywood-produced ; ( 8 ) a widespread acceptance of the inevitability of continuing price increases ; and ( 9 ) show business . " 6 All signs point toward further increases . The advertiser seems to expect mice to go up and the networks have yet to experience major difficulties in selling their programs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , shift away from program sponsorship to participation advertising reby various commercial accounts appear within a program . Since ) , the major amount of advertising in network television has been of the : iple-sponsor type . The trend is away from single program or even alternate week sponhip . This trend , as much as anything else , has made the use of feature possible . The costs of such programming would be prohibitive for sinsponsors but by dividing the costs of the program among several participating advertisers , a feature of two hours or more in length can be sold . Production costs of filmed commercials have increased along with ram costs . A one-minute filmed spot that could have been produced for D ? $1500 in the early 1950s would cost a minimum of $4000 today and c budgets run as high as $25,000 per commercial . If lie who pays the piper calls the tune , it would seem that he who pays // the piper the higher fees will dominate the television song-and-dance . As a matter of fact , he does . Up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network television programs . As we have said , the networks created most of the television as we know it today and they still continue to dominate the programming of American commercial television . The public is most familiar with the various network programs because these are what most of the people see most of the time . There are , of course , some outstanding locally originated programs available at various times of the broadcast day . LOCAL STATION FILM PROGRAMMING Aside from a network , a television station has two principal sources of programs : film and those produced locally by the station . Of those two sources , most stations draw upon film for the larger share of their locally originated programming . The film that is shown consists of both syndicated series and feature movies . Syndicated Film At one time , it was possible to operate a television station daily from sign-on to sign-off with nothing but film and not have to repeat anything that had been shown previously in the coverage area . The moment the major film companies began to concentrate on selling their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station use became a scarce commodity . In place of first-run syndicated film , stations now buy re-run rights to series that have been shown on the networks . The sale and distribution of these " off-network " programs is provided by syndication companies . Through careful selection , a station can present outstandingly popular programs of former seasons from all networks . Syndicated off-network material for a local station should not be selected on the basis of its appeal to station personnel . The program manager , film buyer or whoever is designated to pass final judgment must evaluate all purchases on the basis of his considered opinion of probable local audience response . It makes little sense to buy a film package because it may be the cheapest available . The same value judgments used in the approval of local live-production efforts should be applied to the selection of the station 's film offerings . Insofar as all local originations , whether live or on film , blend into a planned design , the station image becomes clearly recognizable . A hodgepodge of program offerings , some of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Action-adventure , comedy , travel , game shows , variety musicals ? the BROADCAST MANAGEMENT ; e is as broad as show business . Somewhere in all this availability is the t effective combination for each specific television station . But within the several categories , a wide range of quality exists . The t expensive packages arc not necessarily the best . No syndicated or rematerial was created for the specific public of any local television on . Much of what is available can become popular locally . There is also h that can do little , if anything , to enhance the station 's favor in the community . Off-network re-runs , in general , have found favor with many audits . Particularly is this true in the case of series that have had extended of two or more seasons on a network . Those network programs which been scheduled against popular competitive offerings on other netks can make good possibilities for local re-runs . Actually , there should avorable chances for any off-network series with particular appeal for artific local audience even if the series has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only some twenty per cent of the viewers the average original telecast of any program in a series . Any re-run that other eighty per cent can see is a new show as far as they are concerned . It would be difficult , as well as unwise , to attempt to select most of the 1 film schedule from off-network availabilities . Only some of these prons should be chosen . Even in a single-market situation , a station should d becoming a completely second-run house . In addition to the long-established film syndicators , all of whom have erials that should be considered , a relatively new source has developed . Several group-owned stations now produce a variety of offerings for syndication . Can the local station look ahead to syndication of some of its own 1 production ? With the growing need for program sources , it would a that any series with good quality should be in demand . The sales minimization necessary for the circulation of film or video-tape packages it prohibit the small market station from getting into syndication . Yet , possibilities of fruitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a group-station effort should be considered . Pure Film Feature film for television consists almost entirely of entertainment inally made for theater exhibition . It is desirable for station use because is large blocks of time and because of its popularity with the viewing ience . A feature film if properly promoted can often bring a higher ratto a station than any of the competing programs on other stations , ther network or local . After all , feature films are show pieces , many of n brilliantly conceived , splendidly cast and elaborately produced . The value of feature films as a program product is amply demonTelevision // strated by their success on network schedules . No station 's program offerings are well rounded and firmly entrenched for sales purposes without the benefit of feature film strength . Most stations in large markets should purchase the rights for five to seven showings of feature film . Good-sized audiences can be attracted for each showing if there is an interim of six to eight months between each scheduling and if the feature is presented at different times of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , to schedule the re-runs on different days of the week . In small markets , one re-run may be all that may be expected to pay returns to the station and the advertisers . One nighttime showing followed by a daytime re-run after a period of close to a year should be a profitable formula in the small market situation . STATION PRODUCED PROGRAMS If expert knowledge is needed in the selection of film offerings , it is even more necessary in the building and production of the station 's locally produced programs . By and large , all networks stake equal claims on audience appeal . The local station , to achieve dominance in its market , must reach that objective through its local schedule , not by reliance on network affiliation . If the local station turns to syndicated film and feature movies , it may find market dominance equally hard to achieve . Available film for television can not be monopolized by any one station and the differences in appeal between any two stations ' offerings can not be anything but minimal . The only chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local production the station undertakes . Before the networks provided extensive program schedules , when film was scarce and generally inferior , local stations had to produce most of their own programs . Much ingenuity was shown by local program departments , even with only one camera and no remote facilities . Today , with more knowledgeable personnel and far better equipment available , the same degree of resourcefulness should result in outstanding local programming . Yet , far too many stations do not take advantage of this opportunity . The production of local live programs is not easy . It involves more personnel , more time and more expense than are needed to ride the network and transmit film . Sometimes , the return for all the extra investment seems hardly worth the effort , particularly if audiences are small and the ratings are low . Yet , anyone who manages a television station and who hires a program manager with a true dedication to the medium can never be satisfied unless he engages in the kind of activity that motivated him to enter this form of communication in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of new talent , the favorable comments from the audience , these are gratifications that should feed his ego . lie should never be satisfied BROADCAST MANAGEMENT in merely supplying facilities for carrying the creations of other people . If truly of the show-business genre , he will have to be involved with uction because it is a part of his way of life and the product he displays lave to be of professional quality or he will not be satisfied . It has been difficult for the writers of this book to accept the almost lievable naivete of some owners of television stations . Those owners upward of a million dollars invested in each enterprise have entrusted capital , in too many instances , to management that either does not rstand creative programming and production or is not interested in it . e have been cases where owners have been advised by management It is impossible for the station to appeal to local audiences with stationuced programs other than news . It is our opinion that these managers conveniently used this argument to cover their deficiencies in the proarea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the air is hardly ever distinguished or even distinguishable . An example to be ded maybe found in the news-weather-sports format on many local sta . Here , in too many cases , is a public exhibit of the station 's proles1 disabilities . Usually , the news segment is presented first . An announcer reads the from sheets of paper , making contact with the camera only intermitOccasional still pictures are picked up by the cameramen . The director calls for some unmotivated switching in order to give some semblance of ty to the chief visual ? the newscaster 's face and shoulders . The weather segment departs from the use of script and , as a rule , the therman " maintains a fair degree of contact with the camera . He is restricted to a stylized set that is shown in all seasons , featuring a map of the ? d States and a map of the local area , both with prepared weather : ings . For some unidentifiable reason , most " weathermen " seem to an obligation to be clever and they try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who substitute pulchritude for humor . The sports announcer comes on strong and in a masculine manner ides the sports headlines of the day , followed by a reading of the scores of whatever sport is in season . Since the networks give little attention to this ee , most of the scores and other sports information is of a national , . r than a local , character . Visuals on this segment consist of a scorer , an occasional still photo and , sometimes , some silent-film footage . The three segments are usually sponsored separately , necessitating an ing and a closing for each segment . The time needed to open and close her with the time for commercials within each segment leaves little opportunity to give much more than highlights of information . The programs the impression of fast pacing , often to the point of confusion . Standard set and substandard lighting are used . it is true that there is a wide variation in the abilities of stations to // create local programs . The metropolitan station obviously has far more resources available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative differences , however , should be in terms of quantity of output , not necessarily quality . In local production , resourcefulness is a far more important commodity than a huge budget . It is advisable to develop one or two local program formats at a time and then concentrate on their improvement before attempting additional efforts . One outstanding daily local show with general audience appeal in addition to one well produced daily news show would be preferable to a number of mediocre programs . Many stations have not realized the potential for audience popularity in the locally produced daytime program . Robert Mortensen , General Manager of Station WIIC-TV in Pittsburgh , has said : Many stations go to their film libraries during the daytime hours because they feel it may be more economical in the long run . We 've found that local live programming , featuring staff talent , staff material , production and equipment is not only cheaper than running some of the dog-eared oldies that come in most of the film packages , but is one of the finest methods available for a station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a selling medium . This is one area of local television that has so much to offer from an economic standpoint as well as from a public interest angle that I 'm surprised more local stations have n't dumped their films for local personalities and live shows . It 's done far more for us in prestige and profit than any network or syndicated offering could ever do.7 There is evidence of sufficient interest in good locally produced programming to warrant experimentation with new ideas and new techniques . Two examples of local programs with a great deal of originality and creativity may give the reader some ideas concerning how new and different programs can be originated . WBBM-TV in Chicago handed out some 11,000 ballots to homebound commuters , telling them that a program on transportation problems in Chicago would be broadcast that evening and requesting them to watch it and mail their ballots to the station . More than 2500 ballots were returned . This was but one of the series of excellent programs on the station using audience participation . Surveys , opinion polls , local responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pertinent ? program material . Telephone questions and conversations can interest a community . As a variation , studio guests can speak on selected problems during the first ten minutes of each program , then the viewing audience may he invited to ask questions . A case history of Station WWJ-TV in Detroit , as presented as a part BROADCAST MANAGEMENT survey of local station programming in 1966 by Television magazine , ents a convincing argument for local production . The only syndicated used on WWI-TV consists of one daily five-minute show and some oons used on a children 's program . A travelogue , a traffic court , a huntfishing outdoors program , a zoo visit , a women 's interest feature , an ex ; e show , personal advice , actual religious services , a project in woodking , helpful hints on country and suburban living , an information s on homes in the area and a news-weather-sports telecast ? all these locally and rewardingly produced by the station . Children 's shows must be well ? not necessarily expensively ? done or at all . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local news programs in their top-rated local cater than all other types combined . Few stations , however , give them top nt and production status . Every station should budget as high as it can rd for news because costs can be covered through sponsorship . Mobile s are a " must " in any area where significant news is made daily . Helicopters have proved advantageous in large markets for reports of traffic ditions and for special spot news events . Adequate equipment is nice to have . Adequate people are a necessity . program man who greatly relies on stills and silent films , too frequently relies on a still mind and a silent , not to say utterly secret , power of reprise and invention . In the creation of local programming , many stations have discovered the greatest opportunity to be different lies in the public affairs field . The aims of the local public affairs programs should be to inform , to aden understanding , and to stimulate community thinking . In television , ity exists side by side with the illusions of show business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to have it made clear they are witnessing truth rather than the fiction which may be seen at other times . The station has the responsibility to make the distinction clear eliminating the elements of make believe whenever it presents the factual . Every television property should have one individual ( even on partassignment ) designated to handle all public affairs programming . The : lion should not be assigned to a group of individuals nor should the es be passed from one person to another over a period of time . Public irs programming is too vital to be given casual treatment . Unfortunately , many stations have taken the easy way out by giving lip Tice and time allotment to a public affairs concept and failing to interest alert the public to a genuine community problem . A good public affairs program need not be divorced from entertainit . These programs should be produced with all the skill , verve , and cal of commercial programming . If they are well done they can appeal long list of local advertisers . Qualities necessary for sponsorship are : Television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **27;260;TOOLONG , wide viewer appeal , timeliness and news worthiness . In other words ? good television . COSTS OF LOCAL PROGRAMMING The economics of local programming can be frightening when the need for live studio facilities , engineering , production and all other required elements are considered . Some stations ' program expenditures ( total , including all programming , film and live ) are less than twenty-five per cent of their total operating costs . This is incredibly low and it usually reflects a lack-luster programming effort or a weak competitive situation , or both . The average television station should expend about thirty-five per cent of its total station-operating budget for programming . Stations that are not affiliated with an interconnected network may expect costs for programming to go as high as fifty-five per cent of the overall expense . The most effective means of program cost control in a well operated television station is through long-range planning , especially insofar as film programming is concerned . Any station involving itself in one crash film program after another in an attempt to find winners from the available syndicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unhappy auditor . The overall cost of the film product depends upon the type of station and upon the competition for filmed shows in the market . Obviously , in a seven-station market , such as Los Angeles , there is a far greater competitive struggle for all film availabilities than is true in a three-station market such as Cincinnati or Atlanta . There is little uniformity of policy in film pricing . There are few guide lines . Although there is no standard asking price for syndicated film , the average seems to run about $125 for each half hour for a station in a mediumsized market . For three to four additional re-runs over a five-year period , a manager should expect to spend another $300 to $350 . A station in a small single-station market might be able to lease the same film for one showing for $15 to $20 per half hour . The smaller the market , the greater is the chance that the cost of live production could exceed the cost of film rental . In a medium-sized market , both the costs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable . Here , the rental of a syndicated half-hour film might be around $125 and the investment in a local production of a half-hour studio square-dance or polka party , with , say , five musicians and four dancers , could average between $150 and $200 per show . The expenses of local production in proportion to film costs can he kept under better control in stations in major markets . Even here , a deciI I2 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT sion between local live shows and film programming is difficult because of the risk involved in popular acceptance of the local production when the popularity of film is to some degree predictable . Feature film production , as we noted earlier , has not kept pace with the use of those features by television . Prices for their use have skyrocketed . Costs of film features have increased greatly during the past decade in the large markets , more moderately in the medium-sized markets and only slightly in the small markets . Financing a film program usually interests the manager but such other aspects of the film department as editing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cueing and filing far too often receive inadequate recognition . These are highly important parts of the job and they need to be done if the film that the public sees on the air is up to the standard that the station wishes to maintain . Competent personnel can become dissatisfied because of the details of the job and they can lose their pride in accomplishment if there is no direction or sign of appreciation from management . Eventually , a great part of film programming may be automated but until that time arrives the people who work in film deserve more recognition than they have received in the past . There is a distinct advantage in the involvement of the general manager , the program manager , the sales manager and the head of the film department in the decisions that affect the nature of film bought for the station . Each of these executives has a different kind of interest in what is selected . An interaction of ideas at this point in a group-decision atmosphere can pay dividends to the station . COLOR TELEVISION All around us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television , the medium which should be able to make the most effective use of this dimension , was exceedingly slow to adopt it . Several factors accounted for the slow development of color television and all of them were interrelated . An early reluctance of set manufacturers to enter the field and consequent dealer passivity , an indifferent attitude of the public due to the cost of the television receiver , weak advertiser support and the relatively few programs which were transmitted in color , all held back development . Without going into a complexity of technical and psychological reasons , in 1965 a large part of the American public finally became excited over color television . Practically the entire NBC evening schedule , some ninety-six per cent , was offered in color during the 1965 ? 66 season . CBS telecast half of its evening programming and ABC over a third in color . The following year , all prime time programs on all three networks were in color . It has been estimated that up to January 1 , 1966 , some $8o,000,000 // had been spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around $25,000,000 by production companies , for a total of approximately $160,000,000.8 The heaviest expenditures , however , were made by the general public , which by that time had invested around $2.8 billion . It was predicted that the number of color sets purchased would increase from three million in 1965 to twenty-three million by 1970.9 It is apparently only a matter of time before audiences will expect all stations to provide local programming in color . A station that carries network color and then shows its local programs in monochrome may begin to lose sizeable numbers of viewers to its competitors who provide color all the time . Color adds to the emotional impact of entertainment programming as well as to commercials . How desirable it may be in information programming has yet to be determined . Certainly , much historical footage that exists only in black-and-white film and tape will continue to be used . It may be that in certain discussion and public affairs presentations , where emotion could be a deterrent to a concentration on facts , black-and-white telecasts will be preferable . Some combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of experimentation . For several years , however , it may be expected that every kind of program , whether improved by color or not , will be shown in tint . Given something like total color television saturation , the novelty factor will diminish . Then , it will be fully realized that color alone will not save a second-rate program . Once again , a search will begin for new program ideas and fresh approaches . UHF AND THE ALL-CHANNEL SETS In 1952 , the FCC opened seventy new television channels in the ultrahigh-frequency portion of the radio spectrum . Within a year , there were some 120 UHF stations on the air . Except in a few all-UHF markets , the " U " stations had rough going . Most people could not receive their programs and , with minimal audiences , it was next to impossible to get advertising revenues to keep the stations operating . There was , however , no question about the need for the added channels . Only 65o stations could be accommodated in the VHF band . By 1960 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in areas of sparse population . The UHF channels ( 14 through 83 ) could permit from 1600 to 3000 additional television stations but they were not particularly attractive until such time as potential viewers had the equipment to receive them . Once UHF reception was proved practicable in actual telecasting , the FCC set out to assure its being built into future sets . The all channel receiver law , passed by the 87th Congress and signed by President Kennedy in July , 1962 , gave the FCC the ' power to require // that , after a determined date , all television receiving sets manufactured and shipped or imported for sale in the United States be capable of receiving all VHF and UHF channels . That date was later set as April 30 , 1964 . Programming is a key problem for UHF operations . Stations , particularly the ones located in metropolitan areas , have had to operate without the strength of network programs . They have had to compete with established and prosperous stations in bargaining for feature and syndicated film . People in the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people either do not realize they have UHF selectivity or they do not understand what it is . Still , every new set bought represents a potential UHF viewer . In consequence , UHF stations will enjoy the audience their programs can command . The most logical programming for the UHF station under present circumstances has seemed to consist of a kind of service that neither the competing stations nor the networks provide . Specialized stations concentrate on one kind of programming , such as sports , or on specifically segmented audiences . In spite of a considerable amount of ingenuity by UHF operators , the substantially different success format has not yet appeared . UHF has been aided by the new interest in color as well as by an increase in the purchase of portable sets . These , of course , are equipped with UHF channels . It has been predicted that about ninety per cent of American homes should be able to receive UHF by 1970 or shortly thereafter . Since multiple-set homes are on the increase , it may be sooner . The rate of increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of community-antenna television ( CATV ) . CATV Community Antenna Television originated for the purpose of bringing reception to rural or other areas which were poorly served by reason of the inadequate signal strength of existing stations . As the idea grew , it was generally confined to areas without adequate television service . Usually , a tall antenna was erected by the owners of a CATV system and subscribers ' homes were connected with the antenna . A monthly fee was charged . CATV , in its original form , could hardly be called big business . Its revenues were small , from relatively few participants . Then the original concept of service to isolated communities changed . The new function of CATV became directly competitive with regularly licensed stations . No longer were the small communities of very great interest . The larger metropolitan centers became attractive , especially when the programming of key stations in those cities could be extended to other places by micro-wave or cable . Loopholes in existing law made such an extension possible . The new ( ' n'I V had one primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes little capital to introduce competition by wire . It would financially prohibitive to match it on local station budgets . The cost installation of CATV systems average some $150,000 for service to 1 ' homes , around $400,000 for 5000 subscribers and $800,000 to serve 10,000 homes.10 Fees per home average $6o per year plus an initial insta tion charge . It is not difficult to pay off a sizeable loan and realize an alai ciable profit within five to six years with fifty per cent or more subscriber an area . The only key personnel needed are a chief engineer , a technici an office girl , a lineman and a manager who is a combination salesman public relations man and executive . The economics of the CATV cc petitive advantage should be obvious . CATV operators are able to circumvent the multiple-ownership n While the number of television stations per owner is restricted by the Fi to seven , of which not more than five can be VHF , there is no limit to number and influence on regional and local receptions a CATV-installat owner may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CATV produ for the public and for the television industry as long as it concentrates bringing more choices , without duplication of programs , to markets with service or with one or two stations . In the multi-station market , broadca ers found a different story . There , additional channel activation resulted additional segmentation of the existing audiences . Broadcasters , sensing that the problems had grown beyond their cc trol , sent up a cry for Federal regulation of the CATV 's . Not all broadca ers , however , joined in that chorus . Some were already investors in CAT having joined forces with this potential challenger to the established system of television . Thus , broadcasters became divided over the CATV issi This division may be as important a factor as any other in the nature of a settlement that ultimately will be reached . The FCC , already overburdened with its workload , responded to i broadcasters ' cries for help . It proceeded to bring CATV under its jurisd tion even though the additional paper work called for manpower not pi vided for in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in Api 1965 , bringing some 400 CATV systems using micro-waves under its cc trol . Then , in February , 1966 , the Commission publicly announced that those using cable , around 1200 systems , were also to be FCC-regulated. best , FCC action has been ameliorative and temporary . Subsequent action by the FCC included a formal request to Congress that legislation be enacted to clarify and confirm the Commission 's @#@ sumption of jurisdiction over CATV . The FCC asked that the legislation prohibitive to the extent of denying any program origination rights ( ' ATV . It also asked for consideration of the question as to whether t systems should be classed as public utilities and whether they should BROADCAST MANAGEMENT uired to obtain the consent of stations before retransmitting their signals . en work began on the preparation of an information reporting form for filing of required data by CATV operators . In June , 1966 , the House Commerce Committee , after a month of sed-door meetings , reported out a bill to confirm the authority as exerted by the FCC . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bill contained a ban on all program originations except ? limited types , interpreted to include news , weather and time services . mewhat the same blackout provisions as adopted by professional sports re made to apply to CATV . A Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Patents , Trademarks and Copyhts conducted hearings on the CATV aspects of copyright revision dun- ; the Summer of 1966 . A House Judiciary subcommittee had held earlier arings . The settlement of the copyright issue could be crucial to the future CATV . The issues are manifestly too technical and legalistic to be more than rely indicated here . Ultimately , under the American system , FCC rulings these matters must be tested in the courts . Whatever legislation is enacted 1st also be reviewed by court decision . The law will take its course . Any eventual settlement will either need to reaffirm or redefine the American right of free enterprise . Questions of prior rights and simple ethical1 business practices are involved . Certainly , CATV is a programming ue as far as the general public is concerned because its ultimate solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will get on sir home television receivers . As much as anything else , the instances of ciliation and bewilderment on the part of so many broadcasters point up serious need of a basic philosophy for the electronic media . At no other time since broadcasting began has that need been so obvious . PAY-TV Early attempts to establish pay-TV systems met with little success . In 151 , pay-TV was tried in Chicago and , in 1953 , it was begun in Palm rings , California . Little progress was made in either of those cases . The first experiment to receive much attention in the United States was re tried at Bartlesville , Oklahoma , in the late 1950s . The Bartlesville sysn confined its programming to current motion pictures . For that service firing eleven hours a day , customers paid flat fees of $9.50 a month . Only me 500 families in the town of 30,000 population were attracted as customers and the experiment failed . A pay-TV system was started in Etobicoke , a suburb of Toronto , in 160 . This system used three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programming . In 1961 , it came under the control of International mnnnt Pictures Corporation . // The system was a pioneer in the use of leased cables . It closed its operation in May , 1965 , after five years of programming . The reason given for its closing was that all of the information it needed had been obtained . Its subscriber list , initially numbering 5500 , had dropped to around 2500 . Possibilities of moving the system to Montreal were explored after the closing . During its period of operation , current movies and sports had been the most popular offerings . There had been no discernible adverse effect on commercial television viewing . Its attractions had appealed to " selective tastes " and the amount of expenditure per home varied according to the " quantity , caliber and diversity of programming " that was offered . It was reported that revenue from subscribers , which had been expected to reach ten dollars per month , averaged some two dollars . Two pay-television systems have been in operation in the United States in the 196os . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 in Hartford , Connecticut . The other was a wired system , Subscription Television , Incorporated , ( STV ) in Los Angeles and San Francisco . As a broadcast system , WHCT comes under FCC jurisdiction . STV did not . The Hartford Experiment Pay-TV in Hartford began in June , 1962 , as a three-year experiment , licensed by the FCC . The license was granted to RKO General for a system broadcasting coded or scrambled signals that are decoded by an attachment in the subscriber 's receiving set . The system is called Phonevision , a technique developed and patented by the Zenith Radio Corporation . Subscribers pay for the installation of the decoder , a monthly rental fee and a fee for each program they choose to watch . The Hartford license was renewed by the FCC in May , 1965 , for another three-year period . There were several conclusions from its first period of operation . Its appeal had been chiefly to middle and lower income families . The average annual expenditure per family was slightly more than sixty dollars in addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular program fare . Only championship boxing matches drew larger individual audiences . Subscription-TV viewing occupied only about five per cent of the hours the people devoted to television . Charges for programs varied from twenty-five cents for some of the educational features to three dollars for a world-championship boxing match . The average amount charged for motion pictures was one dollar , for operas and ballets it was $1.50 and for sports events an average of $1.37.11 Zenith Radio Corporation and its subsidiary , Teco , Inc. filed a petition with the FCC in March , 1965 , for a rule to authorize pay-television on a national basis . The announcement of the FCC in inviting comments indicated that the Commission was not opposed to such authorization . Ii8 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT West Coast Pay Television Subscription Television , Inc. , was the most ambitious pay system yet attempted in the physical coverage which it embraced , the program service which it supplied , and the $21,000,000 stock offering it made . The STV operation in California was forced to suspend operations in November , 1964 , when the voters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition on which the citizens voted was declared unconstitutional early in 1966 by the California Supreme Court . The majority opinion , in a six to one decision , stated that it abridged the freedom of speech and was in violation of both the First and the Fourteenth Amendments . An appeal was filed by the State of California asking the U. S. Supreme Court to reverse the decision of the state court . WHAT NEXT ? The issues of CATV and pay-television can be solved in a fashion by government edict . The broadcasters of the country , however , could and should have anticipated these crises before they developed . The warnings of the consequences of the industry 's delay were sounded in sufficient time . The prospect of relief from government intervention into television programming may not be on the immediate horizon . It is not too late , however , for broadcasters to prove that they are capable of handling their own affairs . That desired state of existence can not be achieved by a dependence on Uncle Sam to settle problems after and not before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-regulation is proven to be the best solution in all kinds of cases . We will have more to say on this subject in a later chapter . 6 Broadcast Engineering Nothing is impossible with electronics . ? CARL MEYERS , Senior Vice President , Engineering , WGN Continental Broadcasting Company ( Retired ) BOTH RADIO AND television began as scientific and engineering phenomer Essential advancements were made in the broadcasting process before t media were used , first by talent , second by sales and business management Most of the marvels of broadcasting that continue to amaze peel even after they have acquired a fundamental knowledge of its process we developed by members of the engineering fraternity . Those who work broadcast engineering today have inherited the traditions established by t great inventors and innovators from Hertz to Marconi , from de Forest Zworykin . The image-orthicon camera , the Zoomar lens , audio and video tai electronic color and the relay satellites are engineering accomplishmer that might conceivably have been discovered and applied regardless of sr cific informational and commercial usage . Talent , programming , sales and management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They learned to respe mutual interests growing out of the regular communications system that the vital medium as we know it . The engineering world is necessarily technical and apart . The engine is not subject to the public criticism that is often directed at programming and advertising . In his unobtrusive way , he makes his contributions to t : broadcasting process without fanfare . Few outside his own department , i eluding the station manager , understand engineering work and motivatio or are able to comprehend much beyond the simplest basic procedures . C the other hand , the engineer may be inclined to dismiss programming at sales considerations as having very little appeal for him . Even so , friction between the engineering and other departments is more soften due to po BROADCAST MANAGEMENT communication than to a lack of proper understanding and mutual good Once radio took on an air of maturity and sophistication in the early 30s , the close ties between engineering and management that had preled in the formative years eroded in all too many cases . This division of hnical and persuasional interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included networks as well . The breakdown of close collaboration between the work of the engineering department on one hand and administive projects on the other reflected an increasing lack of a common language and the lapse of a common concern . THE STATION MANAGER 'S RELATIONSHIP TO ENGINEERING It is hard to overstate the perils of estrangement . Most station maners are mere neophytes in engineering and rely heavily on chief engiers to supervise the technical affairs of their stations . They often run risks cause of their paucity of technical knowledge in everything from the purase of equipment and details of operations to the attitudes of the engiering personnel . Engineers , too often sketchily or arbitrarily informed ( or bored ) , sometimes miss opportunities to advance proposals that could have real benefits to the organization . With management playing superior . d engineers playing canny , both may find themselves overspending on oposals of facilities or equipment and underachieving in broadcast potentials . FUNCTIONS OF THE CHIEF ENGINEER The chief of the engineering department has varied functions . He must atain a balanced loyalty between management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an executive and , at other times , rect specialists in various phases of studio and station operation ? studio control , short-wave remote relays , video-tape recording and broadcasts , transmitter work and the maintenance of equipment . He must take full reonsibility for all regular maintenance checks and usually he is charged th building supervision and maintenance . Management expects that the chief engineer will maintain proper liaison and provide all needed assistance to each of the departments of the institution . More and more , his services are becoming vital to the manager on Washington scene . He must be skilled in his relationships with the lions . His participation in community affairs is expected . He must be yeast of current trends and probable future developments in broadcast gineering and be able to make recommendations for the station so that it II keep pace with those advancements . No small part of his many functions is the obligation to help the station manager acquire a greater underBroadcast // standing of the work of the engineering department and to keep the manager advised concerning its problems and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the station manager , usually finds himself in an assignment which is somewhat different from the sort of career he once anticipated when he started his work in the broadcast industry . Generally , he finds that many adjustments are necessary . Given the man with the rich background in engineering who discovers the gratifications in leadership and given the manager who has the proper intellectual curiosity about the engineering department , the station has achieved one of the most important working relationships in broadcasting . The ideal is a station manager-chief engineer relationship so strong that the individuals operate in mutual understanding and mutual respect . Balanced Loyalty Historically , the engineer in broadcasting has not been inclined toward the business view . Yet , the chief engineer is expected to become a part of management 's team . With the program manager and the sales manager , he becomes a member of a triumvirate indispensable to the station manager . Men who work in the engineering department expect their chief to represent their interests . The double existence the chief engineer is compelled to live , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the manager and his duty to be loyal to corporate policy , is confusing to one who would prefer to find his satisfactions in his own creative way and not be bothered with the details expected of an administrator . In a sense , too , engineers form a closed fraternity . They can be jealous of their skills and prerogatives . Management may seem remote and indifferent to the men on the cameras or at the control panels . It is , therefore , doubly important that the engineering leader understand and communicate company policy to his department . Shared knowledge makes for mutual interest and cooperation . In a well run broadcasting establishment , the chief engineer is conversant with the what and why of the overall operation . Even then , conflicts are likely to arise . The matter of control of overtime costs for the company at the expense of extra income for the men on the engineering staff is one problem . The question of priorities in cases where the engineers want more equipment or supplies than the manager says the station can afford makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on his staff . The need to sharpen engineering awareness of a station 's needs for cleanliness and good housekeeping when individuals seem to get more satisfaction from their own system of equipment care creates minor irritations . Perhaps the hardest task for the chief engineer ? or for any administrator , for that matter ? is to keep a flow of communication accurate and complete from management to the men in the department and from the men to management . This is a function of a good administrator and the chief engineer , not being disposed ' toward administraI22 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT tion or communication to begin with , often has to be reminded that this is important . It is no easy task to maintain the balance needed between the interests of the people in this department and the manager 's office , especially when so much may be lost in translation , so to speak , unless communication is clear . It applies both ways . Managerial directives may be misunderstood . The technical language of the engineer often has to be explained to management in words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of administration for an engineering executive is in the field of maintenance . It has been proved in many operations , especially since the advent of television , that the finest properties with the best engineering personnel can not do justice to certain technical repairs and still perform their other assignments efficiently . In many cases , therefore , it is efficient and economical to send cameras and other equipment to their factory of origin for overall repair and updating . A well managed engineering department will get the maximum life out of all the major equipment in the station . It will run equipment checks oftener than is expected and it will take special pride in the performance of all equipment . It will have various functional charts for troubleshooting , whether of studio , transmitter or remote gear . It will submit discrepancy reports for every malfunction , no matter how small . The efficient engineering department will prepare an operations manual and will keep it up to date . All station equipment should be checked thoroughly at least four times a year in addition to the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that efficiency results from a rotating system of assignments among studio operations , transmitter duty , maintenance and remote work . Other stations have preferred to assign specific members of the engineering staff to specific functions . The latter policy makes good sense in those cases in which certain men prefer to work in studio production while others are better suited to assignments as far away from production personnel as possible . Assignments should be made by the chief engineer . They should be based on the need to achieve maximum efficiency in terms of the special intersts and skills of his men . Building Supervision It is advisable to vest in the chief engineer the responsibilities for building supervision both in the studio building and the transmitter . In a business that is keyed to electronics , almost every phase of the building unit needs the chief engineer 's guidance and supervision . There is very little of a physical nature in a broadcasting operation that can not benefit directly or indirectly from the professional supervision of the chief executive of the engineering department // In smaller operations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have television stations in addition to radio properties ? there should be most careful planning by the chief engineer regarding the location of a combined transmitter and studio site . With the exception of stations located in our very major cities , there is little reason why studio facilities should not be contiguous to the transmitter . While many stations in small to medium sized markets still maintain divided facilities , it is almost certain that combined operations will become more and more feasible in most locations in the future . Relationship with Other Station Departments The chief engineer must regard his role and that of his staff as a service arm of the radio or television station . While peak efficiency and specific cost control are demanded of engineering management , the programming of the station must be done by the programming department and not by an engineering entity . In short , the engineering department is there to furnish the technical guidance and operational know-how to stage the station 's programming . A good chief engineer must work with the sales and program departments in sales and program development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with audio facilities in the studio and on remote locations . He should assist sales and programming on ideas which are on the drawing boards for future implementation . In most cases , the chief engineer of any radio or television station can be a willing colleague in this area but he needs to be invited to participate . Once he realizes that his suggestions are wanted , he usually makes valuable contributions to the sales and/or program departments . The command function must abide in the front office . FCC Liaison Every broadcasting operation relies upon its chief engineer for liaison with the FCC . In fact , in many stations the only person who is truly qualified to handle many FCC matters is the chief engineer . While this may not be an ideal situation , it does exist . In this regard , the chief engineer must be aware not only of his own abilities but of his shortcomings as well . He should call upon Washington engineering consultants whenever necessary to protect the company 's interests in matters before the FCC . There are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases of their Washington activity without need for outside engineering-consultant aid . Today 's engineering executive must be prepared on the Washington front , as well as at home , for today it is not only difficult to add to or modify station holdings , it is difficult even to retain what one has unless the chief engineer is able to keep management posted on developments of a technical nature . I24 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT Liaison with Unions The chief engineer must carry the major responsibility for liaison with the union men who operate under him . This is true even of companies which are large enough to have their own directors of industrial relations . There must be the closest association with the union shop steward and with the president of the local , as well as with the national and the international offices of the union . Costly hours , days and weeks of negotiation and work tie-ups can be prevented if the proper rapport exists . The chief engineer should not wait until just before union negotiations start or until they are well under way to explain to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches can not be implemented . Those explanations should be an ongoing process , taking place every day as a part of the interpretation of corporate policy . The increased cost of doing business in broadcasting is a constant concern to management but this very economic fact could prove to be the catalyst bringing engineering and management closer together than they have been in the last forty years . Engineering needs to be made knowledgeable of the problems and the concerns of management . Management , in turn , should explain to all of the technically trained personnel what the requirements are for the immediate and the long range future . The road to management-labor relationships can be fraught with disaster unless all laborsaving possibilities are investigated . This does not mean that the engineering payroll should be slashed out of hand . But the industry is now at the point in its development when planning for the future must take automation into account , and this for every operation , regardless of size . The economic facts of life make this inevitable . Technical personnel should be apprised of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , automation not only may bring about sizeable savings , but it can gradually replace costly manpower without visiting undue hardships on individuals involved . Well operated stations with forwardlooking management can , if sufficient advanced planning takes place , absorb into other phases of their radio and television operations all ? or almost all ? manpower affected by the introduction of automated devices . Technical personnel should be told exactly why automation gear , well conceived , well installed and knowledgeably employed , can eliminate many of the human errors that constantly recur and which pose so many sizeable losses for each property over a period of time . But the personnel should be taken care of and they should be given the opportunity to help to decide what their future contributions to the station may be . Participation in Community A fairs The chief engineer should he expected to take part in community affairs but not necessarily in teh smae manner as other members of the staff . // Not always will he be qualified to serve as a speaker before clubs and organizations nor will he usually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be highly effective as a member of organizations . Often , as a member of a church or as a counselor to various charity and educational organizations or as an advisor to the Boy Scouts or to various sports groups involving youngsters , he can be a better representative of the station than many others on the staff . Engineers , as a group , are not much inclined to public speaking , but they should be encouraged to appear before technical groups to address themselves to developments of the art . Many engineers are capable speakers but have a reluctance to appear publicly . Certainly , with the growth in every area of responsibility of engineers and with the reliance that management places upon them , this reluctance should become a thing of the past . Future Planning A good engineering executive looks to the future and plans all technical requirements well in advance . He stays ahead of developments in the industry and plans steps that he can take in the future to provide better performance and , if at all possible , at less cost than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even for revolutionary changes . His planning must be sufficiently in advance so that if a change , say , should be five years removed , he can make arrangements to absorb within either his department , or in other phases of the station 's operation , all of those personnel who would have to be relieved of their current duties due to the change . So rapid has been the evolution of television that it is idle to lay down rules for station housing , equipment , location and design . It is as if we were to cite road maps for yesterday 's prairie schooner in the planning of a tour by today 's station wagon . At best , the present day builder will inform himself as to the basic functions , costs , probable needs and future expansion of his installations . Beyond that he will be well advised to hire the best architects he can find to consult with top programming , sales and engineering people . Once the basic requirements of a television installation are clearly visualized , details of design and construction can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function . Recruitment Engineering recruitment is of paramount importance to radio and television stations for they have never been able to recruit engineering personnel on a satisfactory basis . A good source of supply for many stations is the large technical high school . Broadcasters need to make much more effort to recruit well educated engineering personnel and the chief engineer should he qualified to perform this function after making contact with accredited schools and colleges . I26 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT Relationships with the Station Manager Regardless of his engineering knowledge , the chief engineer can not be truly effective unless his training in the broadcast industry has been broad enough to make him an important factor in the successful administration of the station . In addition to the intelligent scheduling of manpower with efficiency and cost control constantly in mind , the chief engineer 's obligation to management is to seek every possible means of improving the technical performance of the radio or television station . Never let anyone tell you that there is not a difference in the sound or in the look of well or poorly supervised broadcast properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by superior equipment and facilities . More often , it is due to well trained and interested personnel . For example , in the case of color television , on one station in a market , the quality of color broadcast can be a thrilling tribute to this great new dimension in television and , on another station in the same market , it can be the most amateurish tint transmission that one has ever seen since the old fieldsequential system . Every station manager should take the time to become familiar with electronics gear now on the market or sometimes still on the drawing boards of the nation 's major suppliers . Serious investigation of exhibits of equipment at the annual Spring conventions of the National Association of Broadcasters is a must for any station manager who wants to avoid getting caught in the quicksand of surging expenses . Managerial knowledge of the field of engineering and of its equipment can make a difference in profit and loss for the future . There is no more useful pursuit for station managers than the spending of an hour or two each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a familiarity with the engineering field , its equipment and attendant problems . Thus far in this chapter , we have stressed the interdependence of the chief engineer and his department with the general administrative routine of the station . While it may seem incongruous to find front office personnel delving into matters of engineering and certain engineering experts becoming interested in finance and general business activity , this bit of " chemistry " is long overdue in broadcasting . EQUIPMENT PURCHASE Managers of established stations must purchase new equipment . Replacement is necessary for equipment that is becoming outworn or outmoded . Sometimes , however , there is a tendency to postpone equipment purchases or the remodeling of plant or building in order to improve the condition of the annual financial report . This policy may have certain im mediate gains , but it only postpones the day of reckoning . A manager , who // moves wisely in these matters constantly , strengthens his station 's advantages over his competition and thereby improves his station 's profit position . Many managers may not equate eventual increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would change some of their buying practices if they did . There are still some radio stations without mobile units for the coverage of community affairs . There are still a few television stations lacking video tape facilities . Others , as we have noted earlier in this book , have not installed color transmission equipment . What 's more , some stations have not improved basic equipment in their studios , transmitters or offices for years and they give the appearance of poverty when seen by visitors . At the other extreme , many managers have acted on the recommendations of their chief engineers and have continued to show admirable profit margins while engaging in regular expansion of facilities and equipment . These men have proceeded on the sound management belief that one has to spend money to make money . Parallels may be found in other businesses . The old-fashioned drugstore or restaurant , for example , which resists modernization , finds that a great part of its business goes to those other drugstores or restaurants that do spend the money to improve their plants . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs down and operating on a narrow margin between income and outgo . But the margin soon becomes only enough for survival and eventually , if the narrow view persists , even survival becomes questionable . In broadcasting , the rate of technological change is rapid and constant . In order to maintain an improved profit position in radio or television and in order to achieve regularly improved standing among those with whom radio and television do business , outmoded facilities and equipment are not assets . The purchase of additional or replacement equipment and the improvement of building or plant should not be determined by obsolence once . Outlays should be weighed against contributions to profit which the expenitures can make . Decisions to spend are not easy decisions . Only the manager with an alert and informed engineering department can make them wisely . Because of the many factors that may influence the purchase of equipment , it is difficult to estimate the amount such expenditure should be at tiny particular station for any particular year . Annual equipment purchases for television stations may range from $6000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation 's television stations may be conservitively estimated at $35,000,000 each year , exclusive of maintenance costs and engineering payrolls . Looked at in one way , that 's a lot of money . oohed at in another way , it 's a lot of progress . I28 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT FCC RULES VIOLATIONS The Engineering Department of the NAB compiled a list of the most frequent violations of Part 73 of the FCC rules for the six-month period , July 1-December 31 , 1965 . Logging failures accounted for the largest number of FCC citations of error in the case of AM , FM and TV stations . The most general violations of the rules by AM stations are shown in Table I. Tables II and III show a listing of the most common technical errors by FM and television stations , respectively . It may be noted that the proportionate violations by radio stations far exceeded those of television stations , even when the greater number of radio allocations is taken into consideration . In 1961 , the NAB requested a rule-making procedure of the FCC on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then entered manually in station operating logs . The FCC issued a rule-making procedure followed by a Report and Order and new rules became effective on July 19 , 1963. // FCC rules now provide permission for AM , FM and TV stations to use automatic logging devices to keep operating ( transmitter ) and program logs . A third station log for maintenance is mandatory . Daily inspections are required at AM and FM stations , whether or not automatic logging devices are used . Under the rules , a decision on the use of automatic logging devices for operating logs is voluntary on the part of station management . If a decision is made to use the automatic devices , several conditions must be met . The Engineering Department of the NAB has itemized the general conditions of use as follows:2 1 . The use of automatic recorders must not affect the accuracy of the basic indicating instruments . 2 . The automatic logger must have an accuracy equivalent to that of the basic indicating instrument . 3 . Calibration must be made at least once a week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm circuits must be provided . 5 . The automatic device must read each parameter at least once every ro minutes . 6 . For remotely controlled transmitters , the automatic logger must be located at the remote control point . For manually controlled stations , the logger must be located at the transmitter . In addition , it is required " that all manual readings be taken prior to making any corrective adjustments and all readings , whether manual or automatic , must be taken during the absence of modulation . Arbitrary automatic logger scales may not be used . The logger need not be directly in the operator 's view . " Operating logs , whether kept manually or automatically , must show final stage plate voltage and plate current , antenna current and frequency monitor readings . Antenna base current must also be logged once each day under any of three conditions : ( i ) when the remote ammeter is defective , ( 2 ) when specified as a part of the station license for directional antenna operation and ( 3 ) whenever a station operates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier wave do not have to be logged if there is automatic restoration ; if restoration is not automatic an entry must be made describing the cause and length of the interruptions . If the operating log is kept manually , entries must be made at the start of each day 's operation and at thirty-minute intervals throughout the day . The maintenance log requires information on meter calibration , inspections of tower lights , reports on inoperative equipment , reports on equipment tests and , in the case of AM and FM stations , a five-day-perweek inspection report of transmitting facilities that must he made by a holder of a first class license . At the conclusion of each inspection , verificaBroadcast // tion must be made by an entry in the maintenance log . Such entry must include the date and the actual time spent making the inspection , with starting and completion times noted . Travel time to and from the transmitter is not included . Notations must be made certifying that the inspections have been made and descriptions of any repair or maintenance work must be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to make repairs must be given . All program , operating and maintenance logs must be available for inspection on request of any authorized representative of the FCC . RADIO REMOTE CONTROL TRANSMITTER OPERATION In 1953 , the FCC authorized all non-directional AM and FM stations using 10-kw power or less to operate their transmitters by remote control . The privilege was extended to all AM and FM stations , regardless of power , in 1956 . There was a reservation that the operators of stations in excess of Io kw were required to prove the performance and reliability of their transmitters over a twelve-month test period . It is expected that this restriction may be removed sometime in the future . NAB has so petitioned the FCC on the basis of increased reliability of transmitting equipment due to technological advances . The 1956 expanded remote-control privilege did not give operator relief to any AM directional stations , nor to those AM non-directionals with an excess of io kw . These stations are required to keep a first-class radiotelephone license holder on duty at all times when the stations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations with less than 25-kW power were permitted as of April , 1964 , to employ persons holding thirdclass radio-telephone operator permits , endorsed by written examination , to conduct routine transmitter operations . These stations may , under certain conditions , employ on a part-time contract basis a supervisory engineer with a first-class license . Most college graduates , who have majored in radio and television , should be able to take the examination and qualify for the third-class ticket . Testing normally covers three elements of FCC-examination content : ( 1 ) basic law , ( 2 ) basic operating practice and ( 3 ) basic broadcast , which is Section 9 of the FCC examination . Applicants who contact the nearest FCC field office are given a time and location for the test . They are requested to fill out an application ( FCC form No. 756 ) and to submit the license fees prior to the taking of the examination . Most radio and television stations , as well as most departments of radio and television in colleges or universilies , have NAB study guides for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying for the examination . It is recommended that a first-class engineer , who is employed on a ruff time contract basis , he regarded as an independent contractor and that // this designation should be so specified in writing . Other contractual items should include a statement of the engineer 's specific duties , the rate of payment , a specification that he will supply his own tools and testing equipment , the policy in regard to the purchasing of supplies and equipment , a non-disclosure of station information clause and a statement of the length of the contract with termination and renewal conditions . Again , it would be desirable if all differences in transmitter regulations based on amount of station power and nature of antennas might someday be removed . The NAB has worked on the development of equipment capable of taking samples of the electronic condition of any station 's transmission system and of alerting station personnel to any deviations from allowable tolerances . When such equipment becomes available , it is hoped that there will then be no need for a continuance of the first-class operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FCC asking for an amendment of the remote control rules so as to allow VHF television stations to operate their transmitters by the use of either a DC wire-line system or a multiplex off-the-air system . UHF stations are permitted the use of wireline systems . STANDARDS FOR COLOR TELEVISION FILM Quality control in the processing of color film for television is necessary in order to prevent color tones in receiving sets from varying . In switching from one station to another or when the local station runs a filmed color commercial during a color program on film , the variations in color standards may be annoying to the viewer . ALLOCATIONS TABLES The FCC adopted a new FM allocations table in 1963 . Supplemental action was taken a year later to permit . . . existing stations which were licensed under the previous rules to increase their facilities and improve service in those cases where the previous rules would have permitted such increases and in some other cases where the public would benefit . The change in the rules enabled FM stations , in accordance with cochannel and adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and antenna heights . In some cases , the maximum permitted for the class of station could be allowed . The maximum power allowable for ( ' lass A FM stations is 3 kw ; antenna height is 300 feet . Maximums permitted for Class 13 stations are 5o // kw in power and 500 feet in antenna height ; for Class C stations , maximal power is zoo kw and maximal antenna height is 2000 feet . A new UHF allocations assignment plan was issued by the FCC in 1966 . A previous table , announced the previous year , was declared inoperable because of errors in the programming information that had been fed into a computer . This was the first time that the Commission 's computer had been used in the drafting of an allocations table . The 1966 allocations made more low-numbered UHF channels available , although they were not in areas of heavy population . The total number of UHF channel assignments 1698 , of which 590 were made available for commercial television . At the time of the announcement of the UHF allocation table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proposing that channels 70 to 83 be set aside for a new class of 10-kw , low-power television stations to serve small communities . Generally , the UHF table establishes six or more unreserved channels in each of the twenty-five largest markets , five or more in markets 26 through 75 , four or more in the markets from 76 through loo , and three or more in the 101st to the 150th markets . In most cases , those markets under 150th in size were assigned two channels . No commercial channels were provided for markets under 25,000 in population . At least one ETV reservation was made for each state and most major population centers were given two ETV channels . Pressures continue to mount for more frequency availabilities for landmobile communications use . Such users of the spectrum as police , fire and other governmental services , as well as trucking firms , taxi companies and others who communicate with vehicles , have expanded significantly in recent years . With that expansion has come a need for more frequencies . UHF channels 14 and 15 were requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as 1963 . The Joint Technical Advisory Committee , representing various landmobile interests , would like a part or all of the existing AM radio band and the existing VHF set of frequencies to accommodate the declared need for more land-mobile space . The television broadcasting services occupy three different bands in the spectrum . VHF channels 2 through 6 are assigned to the 54 ? 72 megacycle range , VHF channels 7 through 13 are in the 174 ? 216 megacycle area and the UHF channels 14 through 83 are in the portion from 470 ? 890 megacycles . The JTAC argues that a single , more compact set of frequencies for all television stations would make for improved service and savings in the construction of equipment . The committee would like to have the existing hand widths of television channels narrowed . It maintains that the present six megacycle hand is not necessary because the average television receiver accepts only 3.5 to 4.5 megacycles of the band . It is noted by BROADCAST MANAGEMENT those who desire additional space that there have been hardly any changes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JTAC has also recommended consideration of the possibility of wing all local AM radio stations to FM frequencies , and permission for regional and clear channel stations to increase their power so they might be le to cover greater areas . It is the contention of the committee , in its published study , that : Work on the evaluation of the need and toward improving utilization efficiency should go on even though at the outset it would appear that existing investments in stations and receivers might dictate perpetual maintenance of the status quo . The FCC has appointed a Land Mobile Advisory Committee to study problem as well as the recommendations of the JTAC . POWER INCREASES At sundown each evening , more than 25,000,000 people in the United ates are uncertain whether they can get a radio signal that is listenable. is is the number of people who live in so-called " white areas , " which ve no primary nighttime service . The FCC 's solution for the problem is to duplicate thirteen of the reaining twenty-five clear channels and consider further the question of peritting Class r-A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation . The United States Court of Appeals has upheld the right the Commission to revise the clear channels in this manner . Opponents of higher power maintain that the Class i-A stations would in an unfair advantage in other metropolitan markets . The listener , however , does not respond to radio as he does to the high-budgeted television station , which " leap frogs " into his area . Radio is a habit and local medium a:1 whenever local broadcasts are available , they are preferred by the local sidents . WGN , for example , would be dominant in Milwaukee if power and the ability to deliver a signal were the only criteria , for it can be heard better in ore parts of that city than most of the local stations . Those local stations , however , are consistently the favorites of the local citizenry . An increase in Aver from 50 to 750 kilowatts , as has been requested , would increase GN 's signal strength not 15 times on a linear basis but rather approxiately a little less than four times . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the power is increased ) . If the present signal is nsistently better than most , if not all , of the stations in Milwaukee , yet ) es not attract those listeners , then an increase of four times or forty times // the power is not going to interest them either . Milwaukee , of course , is used as an example of the reaction in other metropolitan areas . The situation in the " white areas " is an entirely different proposition . In the upper peninsula of Michigan , for example , there are two local stations in a town of 1o,000 and another in a town only twelve miles away . These stations can be heard very well in the daytime but , at night , there is n't as much as a whisper only two or three miles away from the transmitters . The only nighttime radio service these people can get is the sporadic signal from some clear channel station in Minneapolis , Chicago , Detroit and , on a few rare occasions , Des Moines . It should be time to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of radio reception . In the late 19205 and early 1930s , stations were permitted increases in power from too and 250 watts to i000 watts and , later , from woo to 5000 . There was much hue and cry then about " super " power and , in those days , there were only a few hundred stations on the air . Since there have been 50,000-watt properties operating , the number of radio stations has increased to well over 4000 . It would appear that the 50,000-watt stations did not stifle competition or manifest a monopoly . Rather , they helped greatly in the development of the broadcasting industry by their high professional standards and by helping to make the public and advertisers conscious of the merits of this medium of communications . Higher amounts of power , even on a handful of stations , could benefit every station in the land , regardless of size or location . It could furnish proof to national advertisers that not only is radio alive but its operators are willing to continue to invest money in it and to experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to radio through such a sound development and sizeable amounts of new business could be attracted . We would go further and argue that all classes of radio stations should be allowed to increase their power in order to combat the vast increases in electrical interferences and in man-made noise levels . PERMANENT DEFENSE SYSTEM The new Emergency Broadcast System ( EBS ) , designed specifically for use in case of a war emergency , went into effect in January , 1964 . It replaced the former Conelrad system , which had been in use since 1951 . EBS uses AM stations basically , with FM and TV aural channels assigned to relay and network assistance when necessary . Under the alert system , a federal government message would be issued to the Associated Press and to United Press International . They would flash the alert to stations via their teletype services . Immediately , on receipt of the alert , all , 6 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT regular programming must cease and pre-arranged announcements must be ad . Stations not holding National Defense Emergency Authorizations TDEA 's ) must advise listeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unauthorized stations must leave the air . Any station may apply for NDEA authorization . Stations have a right of appeal to the FCC in the event they refused authorizations . Priorities in the use of the Emergency Broadcast System are : ( I ) mmunications of the President and other officials of the federal government to the public before , during and after an attack ; ( 2 ) local messages ; ) state programs and ( 4 ) national programs and news . Stations authorized to remain on the air may not broadcast any commercials . They may program music , when there is no information to be card , and they also may broadcast information to specific individuals . In the event of an emergency necessitating the use of EBS , daytime ly AM stations could operate beyond their normally licensed hours if no other service is available in the area . Unlimited-time AM stations could maintain their daytime facilities at night . The United States Weather Bureau makes use of EBS for hurricane , tornado and other physical-catastrophe warnings . 7 National Sales He toiled and strove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : He never blew it . He died and this is not Surprising In secret without Advertising ! ? ANON . IN PRECEDING CHAPTERS , We have identified the roles of the programming and the engineering departments in radio and television stations and have cited management 's most important concerns in those areas . Neither of those departments could operate in a commercial station were it not for the contributions of the sales department . This branch of the broadcasting entity produces the revenue which pays for all of the station 's activities and , through good management , makes a profit for the owners of the station . The sales department is the station 's principal contact with people in the world of business . Given a strong radio or television station in a community , the sales force can provide a needed service for merchants and institutional advertisers . Those businessmen depend upon mass communications media to reach people in order to inform as many as possible concerning products and services available . Few business enterprises question the values of advertising . Their corporate concerns are which media to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen will most effectively reach present and potential customers . All of the station 's initial efforts , then , must he in the direction of building technical and programming assets to the point of promising excellent returns for the business community . It follows that it is vital that the // sales representatives of the station be selected with care . A good station can become even better by reason of good salesmen . Good salesmen can become even better by working under good sales managers . QUALIFICATIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE SALES MANAGER The ideal sales manager is one who has had experience not only as a salesman but in other phases of broadcasting as well . Since it is his function to market the station 's product , the more he knows about the total station operation the better he is able to design the various commercial campaigns to achieve maximal results . He should he fully aware of the strengths and weaknesses of all media of communication . This knowledge enables him to study the competitive offerings of other media as well as those of other radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station can achieve leadership over that competition by providing better service . He needs to be knowledgeable concerning newspapers , magazines , supplements , direct mail , billboards and all other advertising vehicles . The ability to analyze media includes a sensitivity for the values of research . A good sales manager should be able to raise significant questions for station research personnel to answer . His examination of data obtained from audience and marketing studies should suggest many sales approaches he can recommend to his staff . The sales manager needs to be experienced in marketing and retailing . With an understanding of each advertiser 's particular problems and objectives , he should be able to make constructive suggestions toward building their business volume . Sometimes , those recommendations may be unrelated to an advertising campaign . Confidence in his business acumen will cause merchandisers to place sizeable amounts of their advertising budgets on his station . As manager of the prime income producing unit of the station , he needs to be aware of station expenses . A good sales manager is as proficient in the control of cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows how to keep expense accounts and general costs in line without diminishing the quantity and quality of sales . The sales manager must be willing to join his salesmen on the street and to work with them in the conception and the making of presentations to clients and their agencies . The man must have the poise , together with the aggressiveness , to gain true respect from men who are successful salesmen themselves . As an administrator , the sales manager needs to be a good organizer . Ile must have the ability and the inclination to delegate most of the routine paper work to capable assistants . The time he saves may then be devoted to // the four main functions of his position . These are : ( I ) the coordination of network and/or agency accounts carried on the station , ( 2 ) the maintenance of contacts with the station 's national and/or regional representative , ( 3 ) the direction of the station 's local sales and service and ( 4 ) sales development . We will discuss the first two of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local sales will be discussed in the next chapter . ADVERTISING AGENCIES AND BROADCASTING When the annual corporate budget for advertising is determined , the company 's advertising agency considers the relative values of each of the advertising media . Then , selection of specific properties within each medium must be made . For some advertisers , a recommendation is made that most of the budget be allocated to the print media . Others are advised to place the largest share in broadcasting . Sometimes , the overall budget is fairly evenly distributed between media . The advertiser , of course , may influence the decision by expressing media preferences . When the amount to be spent in broadcasting is determined , further decisions must be made . What proportion of the amount will go to purchase radio and what proportion to buy television ? What kinds of vehicles ( programs or participations ) are desired and what kinds are available ? How much of the budget should be used to purchase network services and how much should go into spot advertising on selected individual stations ? Which markets should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time buyers are ready with information concerning what is available in time , talent and facilities at the various networks and stations . They know , from " track " records , which availabilities are best suited to the needs of each of their clients . Continuing studies are made of the audience composition of the various networks and stations at the various times of the day . The " reach " of the station , its programming and its community image are known . Costs are determined . Finally , time is bought on the networks and stations offering the greatest return to the advertiser . Such selections have to be as productive as possible . A random choice that does not bring results can be an open invitation to the client to take his business to a different agency . The buyers of space and the buyers of time used to be separated into different departments in the agencies and media decisions were made by account men . Today , the buying function is carried on wherever possible by people who are specialists in all media . Rudy P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as " bright , aggressive , young and college trained  --  - many of whom were , in addition , products of our fine graduate business schools . " The former image of the agency buyer as one 14o BROADCAST MANAGEMENT who had little imagination but who relied heavily on his " horse-trading " ability and his belief in numbers has changed . The modern successful buyer is a well trained , broad-gauged professional . The new role of the agency buyer has made new approaches necessary by the people from the stations and the networks who call on them to influence their buying decisions . For the small market stations , this function is usually performed by the station representative organizations . Whenever direct presentations are made by the station , the station manager or sales manager usually make them . Many larger market stations follow a procedure of assigning specific men from the station 's sales staff to call on a list of agencies . This procedure guarantees that calls are made on a consistent and an organized basis . Sales Manager 's Relationship with Agencies The sales manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigning his salesmen to make calls . An efficient sales manager soon learns the particular abilities of each of his men and what each , in turn , can accomplish at the various agencies . In both radio and television , contacts need to be maintained with large , medium and small agencies on national , regional and local levels . Some of these agencies place a high value on quality in advertising , often favoring an institutional approach . Others , largely local in nature , have little interest in the image created by their advertising . Their desires are confined to fast returns noted on the cash register . Knowing these variances at agencies the sales manager must consider the makeup of his sales staff as well as of the leading buyers and other personnel at the agencies . He needs to match his salesmen with specific agencies on the basis of the probable effectiveness those men may produce from the assignments . The sales manager should never remove himself from selling . In addition to directing his salesmen to specific targets and working with them for improvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Time and his station 's circumstances and market conditions permitting , it is important for him to be active with at least one or two agencies so that he will not lose touch with the field . His calls also enable him to keep abreast of the problems his men confront . After every agency call by a salesman , the sales manager should receive a report from that salesman early the following morning . Whether this is a verbal report or a briefly written statement , it is a necessary requirement so that the executive may be kept posted on progress or problems anticipated . Through the maintenance of a month-to-month tabulation of all accounts with the various agencies , the sales manager can determine the gains or losses and strengths or weaknesses not only of each salesman but of the station in its relationship to agencies and clients . // The sales manager should also maintain relationships with those agencies that are called upon by the men of his staff . He should plan periodic trips to the major advertising centers of New York and Chicago and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These trips should be made at least once every three months . In many cases , the station 's location may be such that it has within its state , or in a nearby state , a regional advertising center that generates considerable sales traffic . A personal visit by the sales manager every thirty days to all of the agencies in that market should be an all but absolute necessity . Some stations in close proximity to a major regional advertising center cover those agencies as frequently as once a week . Where this is done , rich dividends in added sales usually result . It is perfectly in order for a salesman to call upon a national advertiser directly , but it is a cardinal sin for him to do so under any circumstance without first advising that advertiser 's agency . There are times when a call on an advertiser by a station can be of great help to the agency , particularly when the sales presentation may involve a completely different approach from that which is normally pursued by the agency . In such a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advertiser and his agency personnel . One of the most successful selling organizations in broadcasting is that of the Avco ( formerly Crosley ) Broadcasting Corporation . It has not only given much consideration to discussion of sales matters directly with advertisers ; it has always instructed its sales personnel to advise agency executives of this intent . In no case has a strained relationship resulted therefrom and the happy results are known to the trade . Importance of Station Image The image of the station conveyed to advertising agencies has assumed increased importance in the placement of spot business . With so many stations trying to make impressions on the agencies , the identification of outstanding features of any particular properties has become difficult . Station assets not found in ratings need to be communicated . Agency men are in quite general agreement that local station images are of greater importance in radio than in television due to the numbers of radio stations that make media selection more difficult . Some agencies consider station image of such importance that they employ personnel to collect as much information as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . They are interested in descriptions and verifications of qualities and services usually not reported . Cooperation from most stations in the gathering of such data is disappointing . If a station wants increased spot advertising , it needs to give the agencies proof ' of its prestige in the community and of those characteristics which make it different , desirable or unique in a market . // Agency Problems and Progress Contrary to what some people think , life at the agencies is not exactly a bed of orchids . Rising costs for the advertiser , increased operating expenses , the switching of agency accounts and greater emphasis on proof of performance are but a few of the problems the agencies have had to encounter in recent years . In spite of these and other problems , and in spite of the maintenance of a traditional fifteen per cent standard commission , advertising agencies continue to grow and their billings continue to set new records each year . In 1952 , BBD &O; billed $40,000,000 in radio and television in what was then the highest amount for a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually and many of these bill over $100,000,000 in broadcasting . An improvement in the agencies ' service to their clients has been effected through the use of electronic computers . Analyses , media decisions and billings that formerly took weeks or months of man-labor can now be accomplished in a matter of hours . Differences between media and relative strengths of stations can be determined accurately without human guesswork . Already , the mountains of paperwork involved in the buying of spot advertising have been reduced significantly . Once the computer can be used to turn audience data into sales predictability figures , time buying will become a science or at least an activity capable of mathematical expression . SPOT BUSINESS AND THE STATION REPRESENTATIVE The system of station representatives , commonly called station " reps , " began in 1932 . Before that time , the process of representation of individual stations to national and regional advertisers and agencies was true chaos . A brokerage system prevailed , organizations or individuals often represented competing stations in the same market and general price-cutting was standard practice . In 1932 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms . Petry organized his company on sound business principles and ethical practices , thus establishing high standards for the firms which were to follow . Refusing to do business with time brokers , his company instead dealt directly with station managers . Petry insisted that the one station in any market which the company selected to represent must be concerned with quality operation and fair business practices . Nationally , this made a select list of radio stations with great appeal as advertising media . From an initial list of thirteen stations in the country , Edward Petry and Company grew to the point where separate divisions are now needed for radio and television in offices located in nine metropolitan centers . In the three years following the beginning of the Petry company , // twenty-seven additional station representative companies were organized .. Since 1935 , there has been a steady increase in the number of national and regional " reps " in broadcasting . Table I shows their growth by five-year intervals . The total of 153 firms in 1965 was approximately evenly divided between national and regional companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative , offices have to be maintained in New York , Chicago and at least one other major market . figure No standard commission rate exists in the station " rep " business . Rates for both radio and television vary from company to company and from station to station . Owners of several station properties have been known to get a television rate as low as five per cent while other television stations even in small markets have had to pay up to fifteen per cent in order to be represented . Some " rep " firms maintain standard rate policies but throughout the business there is no standardization . Usually , radio stations are charged more than television stations for representation . The Sales Manager and the " Rep " The station sales manager should work closely with his station 's representative in every market where that company has an office . The sales manager must arrange for the " rep " to receive regularly all updated sales tools essential to selling the station . These materials should include program schedules with all changes noted , station brochures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for specific clients . The sales representative can be no more effective in selling the station than the data supplied by the sales department permits him to be . Unfortunately , stations do not automatically receive spot business merely by signing with a " rep " firer . The sales manager regularly has to agitate the representative organization , particularly in the case of those firms ? and there are a number of them that do not show much aggressiveness or industry . A wide variance // in initiative exists among the " rep " organizations . Some of them work almost around the clock to obtain business for the stations on their lists . In those cases , the station sales managers contribute considerable energy to keep these sales entities supplied with data and give them maximum assistance . There are other station representative organizations that hardly extend themselves beyond an occasional " strike . " Indeed , all too many are found in this category . It is difficult to have respect for those " rep " firms and their salesmen who get their business by sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting agency calls for availabilities . There is some cause for optimism in a recently expressed concern of many of the station representative companies for more station integrity in the use of their rate cards and for less expediency in selling . It should be noted , however , that off-the-card deals are made regularly by some " reps " who care little if anything about the image or the reputation of the stations they represent . The sales manager should insist upon a weekly call report from each of the offices of the station 's representative . A sales manager who does not have this control over the station 's " rep " does not truly manage station sales and is derelict in his obligation to top management . With these weekly reports , he can remain current on all national sales activity , he is able to compare the monthly and annual performance of the " rep " for the station and he can analyze the station 's overall ability to continue successful relationships with an agency and its clients . Station representatives now provide services to television stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right film purchases with the right advertiser can often result in added national spot business for a station . In these decisions , the " reps " can play an important role because of their knowledge of client desires and their accumulated data on the kinds of film packages available . Most of them maintain " track records " or ratings of the various off-network re-runs in several markets . This information is made available to the stations they represent . Reliance of stations on Sales Representative Companies With some disquiet , we note a substantial amount of reliance by station managers and sales managers on their station representatives for management advice having nothing to do with sales . In too many cases , the " reps " have , in effect , become station consultants without fees for extra services . It may seem absurd but it is today possible for a man to " manage " a radio or television station practically in name only . When problems arise , he has only to turn to his station " rep . " There he may get answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to attempt to confront . Broadcasting magazine reported that reliance on the station representative " has already reached the point where many stations hesitate to buy a duplicating machine or paint the office without at least mentioning it to their // reps. " 3 Incredible " authority " and responsibility , thus given to sales repre-. sentatives by some stations , results in a transfer of a great deal of policy control from the station manager to the " rep 's " president , board chairman or operations head . This sort of referral has led to some poor decisions , damaging to individual stations and harmful to the total industry . We are not criticizing the involvement of a " rep " firm in occasional discussions pertaining to broad station policy , past , present or future . Nor do we advocate that the station representative should absent itself from all sales promotion and sales development plans of the station . This would be sheer folly . But the willful or witless transfer of a manager 's basic responsibilities to an absentee station " rep " is inexcusable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lackluster performance by certain stations and by some sales representative organizations as well . We have discussed here the overall role of the station representative and we have been critical of some practices , but it should be made crystalclear that the good sales representative firms , and there are some that are truly outstanding , have made profound contributions to the development of the radio and television arts . The negatives to which we have addressed ourselves originate usually not from desires of the representative organization , but from the ineptness of ill-trained , ill-prepared station management . There are too many men and women in capacities of authority in radio and television management who lack the slightest idea of proper management of a broadcast property . Thus , the " rep " becomes a " crutch . " Self-Representation At the opposite pole from those stations , which have become overreliant on the station " reps , " are other stations that have terminated all relations with their national sales representative companies . Starting in 1959 , a few stations began to represent themselves exclusively . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station " reps , " account for approximately $200,000,000 in national spot billings . This is almost one-third of the total for the radio and television industry . The trend toward self-representation has an interesting background . In August , 1959 , the FCC finalized an order requiring the networks to stop selling spot time for stations which they did not own . ABC had discontinued its spot representation division in 1952 , but NBC and CBS were still in the business of representing stations . Under the FCC order , the networks could continue to represent their " o to o " ( owned and operated ) stations , but they had to drop all other stations from representation . The order affected thirteen stations . Although self-representation has for the most part been confined to group-owned stations , there have been a few cases where other stations have joined the groups for purposes of representation rather than continue with their independent station " rep " organizations . // It is anyone 's guess how far the trend toward self-representation may go . Evidently , it is here to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that they have been able to get their share of agency and advertiser attention . The regional representatives seem to be largely unaffected by the trend to self-representation . Their billings , of course , are considerably less but so are their overhead costs . Some regional representative companies bill as little as $250,000 a year . Others bill one to two million dollars annually . Spot Sales How does a buyer in an agency determine the differences between stations in those markets where there are fifteen to twenty facilities ? Does the small market station have a chance at influencing the agency buyer ? With so many stations , it is difficult to make intelligent differentiations among them . Undoubtedly , there have been cases in which more logical purchases might have been made . In partial explanation , agency time buyers and station " reps " have consistently complained about the lack of standard data from the local stations . Much station sales data are poorly organized and reveals little of importance to aid buying decisions . Competitive print , outdoor and direct-mail media supply useful demographic information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media and station selection , stations will have to supply their representatives and advertising agencies with information comparable to that submitted by the other media and on a regular basis . Otherwise , they will not only fail to gain but they may lose spot revenues as a source of income . It has been said again and again , and correctly , that radio has been undersold and that its force in advertising has never truly been realized . Files are , or could be , filled with radio 's success stories . Still the medium has never achieved its fair share of the advertising dollar . It has never really been properly sold . It will not sell itself . Complete data on audience compositions at various hours of the day , broken down demographically , and opinions of audiences and advertisers regarding the station 's service , contain basic information for those who have the power to spend the national advertiser 's budget . Apparently , the gathering of such material and its preparation in meaningful form has been , and may continue to be , too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers do not understand the very basics of station operation . It is time for station managers to realize that exaggerated statements about station effectiveness impress very few people who count . Such distortions really hurt the station in terms of its long-range income possibilities . There is no substitute for fact . One would think that managers of stations would realize this truism . Some of them persist in the use of halftruths and , sometimes , downright untruths . This is bad for the industry . It is // deplorable that the same executives seem to believe that their claims are accepted . Far too much internal warfare vexes the radio medium . Stations fight other stations in their markets . Although there is sufficient potential business for all stations , infighting too often results in losses of revenue for every station in the area . Radio management must somehow learn that the industry needs to improve in its ability to attract advertising money from other media , not just from other ( and rival ) radio stations . With the increase in the number of television stations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer medium . Consideration must be given to benefits to be derived from cooperative preparations of key data on a state wide basis or , in the cases of the multi-station markets , a city wide basis . Many small businessmen in broadcasting will benefit from this kind of federation . They must cooperate if they expect to compete in the spot market against the large corporations who are after the same dollars . The crux of the matter is a realistic and honest appraisal of exactly what the individual station can do for specific advertisers . Once the station representatives and agencies can get this information regularly and know they can rely on it , the station will be in a good position to receive the spot accounts it deserves . The data are a necessary supplement to , but no replacement for , effective personalized selling . Every station needs to campaign vigorously and steadily at the agencies and with the " reps " in order to achieve its goals . Is there to be a crisis in national spot radio ? Some agencies , admittedly the smaller ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients . Salesmen from radio stations have not been given a very warm reception at some agencies for some time . Agency personnel have been critical of the presentations made by radio 's salesmen , saying that they showed little understanding of the problems of specific advertisers , that they used valuable time to try to put other radio or television stations in a bad light , that they were so full of unproved claims that their sales arguments were meaningless . Agencies complain about violations by some radio stations of the unwritten rule against calling on advertisers directly . Agency buyers have reported publicly that the salesmen from many radio stations are not as effective as those from television stations . Some of those agencies insist that radio salesmen appear to consider themselves in a training phase for later employment as television salesmen . The latter probably manifests itself in circumstances under which joint top management of a radio-and-television mutually owned broadcast entity fails to operate its properties independently or favors television over radio . It is incredible to see the number of major broadcast companies whose executives in top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . These men create their own problems . Unfortunately , the use of a double-rate system by many radio and television stations tends to confuse , rather than to construct . The frequent usage in station presentations of negative remarks about other radio or television facilities , plus inflated claims about the salesman 's own station , have caused some agency buyers to reject the stations which those salesmen so poorly represent . Is there already a crisis in national spot radio ? Very clearly , there is for some stations . But there is much " gold in them hills " in national radio spot schedules and , obviously , some stations are getting it . A CAUTION That there could be dangers of complacency due to progress and prosperity hardly needs to be mentioned . Competition on both the national and the local levels from other media does not stand still . In the national spot market and to a considerable extent in the local field , television and radio are competitive and must often sell against each other as well as against the other advertising media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broadcasting industry but there are also dangers , one of which is the rising cost spiral which accompanies the increased income . In a later chapter of this book , we discuss the management of income and expenses in order to produce profit . For the moment , we should be aware that the figures on revenue show only one aspect of the financial picture . It is an important aspect , of course , for without a healthy income all else in commercial broadcasting could be written off as futile . Still another danger is masked in a regularly ascending curve of income . Extra effort may not be expended to maintain and to increase rising revenues . Such increased effort is necessary in order to offset added costs . The condition calls for more energetic and more creative selling by the localstation salesmen , by the station representatives , by the agencies and the networks and by the industry sales promotion organizations , the Radio Advertising Bureau and the Television Bureau of Advertising . The chief foe of progress is ? it must always be remembered ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a well About the goods he has to sell , Will never reap the golden dollars Like him who shows them round and hollers . ? ANON . WE HAVE ALREADY noted that , in the case of radio , local sales constitute the largest source of income . We have also noted that in television the revenue from local sales runs behind both network and spot in total national figures . Yet , the average amount of local sales per television station is considerably higher than the average amount per radio station . The competition of the greater number of radio stations and the higher rates of television stations are two factors in the differential . The number of salesmen per radio station is , on the average , less than the number employed by a television stations , but the income for a salesman of local advertising , whether in radio or television , can be attractively high . Other than starring roles for top performers , the sales department offers higher individual incomes than any of the other departments of a station . The most usual route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain definite advantages pertain to a choice of sales as a career : ( t ) In any industry , comparable grades of professional status are usually better paid in sales than in any other department ; ( 2 ) The work of the salesmen brings constantly changing challenges ; ( 3 ) The opportunities to learn human nature are boundless ; ( 4 ) The good salesman need not worry about a job since there are always more positions open in sales than in most lines of endeavor ; and , ( 5 ) The man who travels about meeting other people learns of opportunities that never come to the attention of the person who works with the sank people day after day . In spite of both immediate and long-range opportunities in sales , it is I50 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT more difficult to find good salesmen than it is to find most other kinds of broadcasting personnel . Usually , there is a surplus of applicants for most other station positions , but almost always a scarcity of people who want to sell . With the existent opportunities in sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of this should suggest advantages in the choice of a sales career by young persons of college grade . In radio-television , there are plenty of openings for the right people and there should be many opportunities for advancement . We stress the " right people " because we are convinced that nothing can be worst than frustrations experienced in this field by those who are not by nature inclined toward a sales career . No one should ever go into sales work motivated exclusively by the money rewards . He must like to sell or he will be a failure before he starts . SELECTION OF A STATION SALES STAFF In view of the current shortage of candidates for sales work , one of the most difficult tasks of the sales manager is to find and select people for new or replacement positions on his staff . The responsibility is doubly important because wrong choices can be extremely costly . Losses to the station caused by the enraged client or by the broken contracts are too imponderable to try to estimate . The employment of good salesmen can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clients . Since promising sales candidates are in short supply , the selection process should not be conducted haphazardly . Personnel people are in agreement that the essentials in selection are : ( I ) a well defined job analysis in writing ; ( 2 ) some valid testing procedures and ( 3 ) a good , intensive interview . The tendancy to employ on the basis of any single convincing physical , mental or personality trait should be avoided . Before hiring any experienced salesman , his past record should be given prime consideration . If he has been successful in sales in the past , the chances are that he will be successful in the future ; if he has been a consistent failure in the past , the odds against his success are usually too great for a canny gamble . A successful sales record in a field other than broadcasting may or may not be an indication of success in radio or television . If the man has been successful in the selling of intangibles , his chances of doing well in broadcasting may be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to broadcasting from sales experience in a different field will require a considerable amount of time for indoctrination and adjustment . The inexperienced person should not he ruled out as a possibility . This would he a foolish rejection of some people who have excellent long range potentials . ' These people need to he given careful training and supervision . // They should not be expected to produce significant results for some time after their initial employment . Given the patience , encouragement and understanding they should have , they can develop into some of the best salesmen the station can employ . Most of them will be highly appreciative of the time devoted to their development and this will be shown in the surprising amount of business they will later produce . It should be recalled that the most successful salesmen once had to be given that initial start by someone . The interviewer should look for evidences of an extroverted personality , a high degree of intelligence , a gregarious nature , signs of perseverance , an ability to get along with people , a good appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , frankly , a strong desire to make money . Two researchers , Charles F. Haner and Givens L. Thornton , were intrigued by the problem of trying to discover what behavior traits seemed to distinguish successful from unsuccessful salesmen with four medium sized companies . ) While their findings might or might not apply in the case of radio and television salesmen , there could be a strong possibility of an important carryover . Haner and Thornton found that , of several hundred behavior traits analyzed , the most important in distinguishing between good and poor salesmen was the willingness of the salesman to study the needs of the customer on a careful and detailed basis . The next most important trait was the ability of the salesman to set goals and quotas for himself which he was willing to follow . Other factors , in order of their importance were : keeping the customers informed , persistence , analysis of the sales effort , knowledge of the competition , keeping the company informed and coverage of the territory . Those factors least valuable in distinguishing between the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits , personal traits , home life and group activities . In summary , job oriented behavior traits were of highest importance ; personal and social traits were of lesser importance . The truly effective , truly successful salesman in broadcasting is the one who , after convincing his clients to use his station 's facilities , follows through and makes sure that sales results happen which please the clients . Nothing is more desirable in sales than long term salesman client relationships . THE SALES MANAGER AND THE SALES STAFF Bases for Assigning Salesman 's Accounts Several factors need to be considered before assigning a salesman to the accounts on his list . His knowledge of certain retailer 's stores , an understanding of the particular problems of a specific kind of business and the salesman 's previous experience in dealing with certain types of retailers are // all important considerations . Most important , though , is the salesman 's probability of compatible relationships with the accounts . The sales manager needs to use his best judgment in the matching of salesman and client according to their temperaments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the salesman should determine the length of time he remains assigned to each account . Choice station accounts are usually assigned either on a basis of seniority or successful sales experience . A younger , less experienced member of the station sales stall should he prepared to build his initial list into lucrative accounts by providing , excellent service to his clients after they are sold . Accounts , of course , should not he transferred once a good relationship has been established , unless there is no alternative . It takes a good salesman , with plenty of patience and a thorough training in radio or television , to get on a conversational basis with many of the people who are assigned advertising and buying positions with retail establishments . Some store buyers and advertising managers seem to favor the print media so exclusively that one suspects that they have ink in their veins . Unfortunately for the salesman of broadcasting , retail management listens to those buyers and advertising managers . Radio-television salesmen assigned to such contacts should have backgrounds of experience or training in retailing as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to talk the language of those who are engaged in every conceivable category of retail sales . Here a lack of merchandising know-how can be disastrous . It has been estimated that not one salesman in ten can qualify for selling the typical resistant retail establishment because the typical broadcast-media man can not talk with the retailer intelligently about his particular business and suggest solutions for his more important problems . Nor do more than a few broadcasters understand any media except broadcasting . Store managers , as well as buyers and advertising managers , feel comfortable with the printed ad . They can look at it , admire it and show it to their co-op people . It is a tangible ; broadcasting is not . The salesman will not make headway with these men by attacking their use of the print media . Radio and television are so strong and have such an enviable success record in advertising for all categories of retailers that the positive sell is the one and only route to take . We must admit as broadcasters that newspapers will always be the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . But these same retailers can gain much additional business through theft intelligent supplementary use of radio and television . There is no profit in denunciation and derogation . It is the place of the broadcast salesman to make the client feel comfortable in the presence of his kind of advertising and to show how profits can he made from its use . It is his job to bring them to an open mind about radio and/or television . Local Sales 153 Staff Sales Conferences and Reports The sales manager should hold daily sales conferences with the members of his sales staff . Early each morning he should meet with them to check their contacts of the preceding day . In these meetings , strategies may be worked out for that day in line with existent availabilities . Each Monday morning , the sales manager should get individual reports from his salesmen that recapitulate their activities and reflect their work of the previous week . On the basis of these reports , the sales manager is able to spot troublesome cases where it may be advisable for him to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where talent is involved in a potential sale , the sales manager may decide that a follow-up presentation involving the participation of that talent may help a salesman to clinch a sale . At least four times each year , half-day or day-long meetings should be held , perhaps on week-ends , to engage in long range planning . Representatives of the program department and the station " rep " should attend these sessions along with the sales staff . Outside consultants may also be included . The sales manager should keep records in his office of each salesman 's performance with his clients and with the agencies to which he is assigned . Regular reports of progress should be prepared for the station manager . These are not , it should be added , exercises in paperwork . They are supplementary to brainwork . Sales Quotas It is the sales manager 's responsibility to set sales quotas . By making realistic evaluations of each salesman 's list of clients and/or agencies , proper quotas can be established . These , however , can not be rigid expectations . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department stores and the supermarkets , emphasize print media almost exclusively . The newspapers run page after page of advertisements every day for these stores while radio and television settle for a few spot commercials . How can the local station increase its share of that retail advertising ? What kind of work , determination , enterprise and imagination does it take ? We have already noted that it is imperative that a radio or television station story be supplied to the station 's " rep " in order to increase the chances of attracting the investments of national and regional advertisers . That same story , with chapters regularly updated , should be used as a selling tool for the local advertiser . The station master sales plan should he made up of basic information covering the strength of the station , circulationwise , its image in the community and within the industry and , finally , its success stories . It should include descriptions of the facilities and the special equipment which enable // the station to perform its services efficiently . It should relate , in detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever live talent is available and , in the case of television , the film library . If merchandising services are provided , these should be mentioned . Added to this general sales material , special applications should be included which are designed specifically for each individual advertiser . In local sales , the uses of the data differ from the manner in which the materials are used on the national scene . Locally , the contacts are more direct and more personal . Very few deals are closed over the telephone . Local selling involves men calling on men they have called on many times before . Tailor-made presentations and specially constructed commercials or programs must be designed to meet special needs of specific merchants . The local salesman in radio or television used to rely on the power of his media to make good on his promises to the retailer . Today 's salesman knows that there is no magic in a broadcast campaign unless it is targeted to a particular client 's needs and objectives . The modern salesman becomes as interested in helping the advertiser to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales efforts . In a way , the modern broadcast salesman works as much for his clients as he does for his station . If he is truly an authority in retailing , he should be able to make suggestions which not only will surprise the merchant but can make the salesman 's counsel so valuable that the businessman will come to depend upon him for ideas . The retail-oriented salesman ? and he 'd better be ? will know that the advertising he can supply will be successful only if the store is modern in its services , its facilities and its customer conveniences . The salesman should be able to show the retailer how to accomplish that modernization . So the station 's local sales representatives , its salesmen , must be experts in helping the retailer to grow . The advertising on radio or television is but one service which the salesman must be privileged to provide . THE SALESMAN 'S PREPARATION FOR THE SALE Before a presentation is made to any local retailer , the salesman should make a study of that firm 's past and current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successes in general . The field in which the retailer does business should be carefully studied by the salesman so that he will be able to converse intelligently on the prospective advertiser 's interests and problems . Such study will disclose , for example , that the problems of the owner of a shoe store are completely different from those of the owner of a jewelry store , say , in the month of April . The salesman will discover what the peak business months in the year are for such other enterprises as grocery // stores , hardware stores and drugstores . Seasonal fluctuations that differ within various retail categories need to be known if the salesman is to make the right sales calls at the right times . In order to talk to the point in his presentation , the salesman needs to know the retailing methods of any specific client . Patterns of store traffic , uses of merchandise displays , the personalities of store clerks , the conveniences and services of the store and the kinds and quality of merchandise must be studied carefully . The basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about each specific prospect or client and his business . No one , regardless of his background or experience can be fully effective without pertinent knowledge . Studies of local retail establishments should include research into other local retail firms and those in other markets in the same category . For example , in the case of men 's clothing stores , the salesman needs to know the problems of a particular store but he also needs to be thoroughly familiar with the men 's clothing industry . A salesman calling on a men'swear establishment should be well acquainted with the current ads in such publications as Gentleman 's Quarterly , Esquire and the leading sports publications . Additionally , he should study the trade publications for the men'swear field . Such sources of information exist for every kind of retail establishment and they are available in most large libraries . Most radio and television salesmen have not taken the time to do their homework in the various trade publications of each retail category or they have n't known how to make that preparation . The more a salesman for radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category , the more successful he can be in helping to move his merchandise . This , as we have said before , must be the first objective of any good radio or television salesman . One of many reasons why radio and television stations have not garnered their fair share of department store advertising is that their salesmen have not understood the advanced planning of store buyers , merchandisers and advertising personnel . Time and time again , we have witnessed stations spending vast sums of money for beautiful presentations to department stores six or eight weeks before the Christmas shopping season . The advertising budget for that particular store probably was established in the first quarter of the year , if not early in the last quarter of the previous year . Advertising plans in most department stores and in many retail establishments are finalized six months or more in advance of their actual campaigns . This is especially true in the case of seasonal types of advertising where certain lines of merchandise have a consumer demand for a brief period of time . If the salesman from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated for the year he simply wastes his time . Incidentally , some long term business relationships between broadcasters and retailers have been formed by salesmen who anticipated store decisions // on seasonal merchandise . The success of those short term contracts has resulted in year-round advertising by those stores on radio and television stations . Every retailer who is engaged in a bona-fide business and who practices ethically is a prospect for radio and television . The prospect potential is almost unlimited in any market , regardless of its size . In most markets , however , and especially the larger ones that include both radio and television stations , leading retailers can be persuaded to use the broadcast media only when specific campaigns are prepared especially for them . A substantial revision in this pattern is beginning to manifest itself in some major markets . In a small upper Michigan community , which has several radio stations , one broadcasting property boasts Ioi local accounts out of 116 firms in the community . The business ranges all the way from an institutionaltype show for an iron mining company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no accident . THE SALES PRESENTATION Few sales are made in one call . It is not unusual for a salesman to average five to six calls on a retailer , large or small , before an initial sale is consummated . Much that we will have to say about the sales presentation really applies to a succession of visits by the salesman . If the retailer has an agency , no matter how small and how inexperienced it may be in the use of broadcast media , that agency should be consulted before a presentation is made . There may be a resistance on the part of many of the smaller agencies to the possible use of radio and television for their clients . Whenever this happens , it is both fitting and proper for the salesman to take his case directly to the client , explaining his intent in advance , of course , to the agency . Regardless of the attitude of the agency toward broadcasting , whether cooperative or reluctant , the station should and must have a contact with the client . The person who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would have been consulted had there been no agency involved . He may be the advertising manager , the head buyer or the owner-manager of a retail establishment . In calls on retail establishments , the salesman must first sell the merits of his medium to the client . He must also sell a concept that the present advertising policy of the establishment can be improved upon and that increased sales will result . After selling his medium and his concept , the radio or television salesman must then demonstrate how the station 's programming , geared as it is to the community , can be helpful in reaching the retailer 's present and potential customers . The station 's coverage , its circulation and its audience composition Local Sales r57 should be shown in the sales presentation . The salesman must point out the availabilities which can do the most for the client and explain why . The retailer needs every bit of service , advice and guidance that the salesman can give him , particularly if he is a neophyte in the use of the broadcast media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with information on the tools used by similar business establishments which employ radio and television in other cities . The Radio Advertising Bureau and the Television Bureau of Advertising have large inventories of such success stories . Of course , evidences of local successes have motivated many a non-user of radio and television to enter broadcasting . Any salesman will find that his initial presentation is made much more effective through the use of audio tapes , films or slides . These selling aids should first of all demonstrate the impact of his medium and then , with actual commercial samples produced specifically for the store , illustrate what can be done for the respective departments and for the store in general through the use of the station . Most large stations own broadcasting industry presentations on audio tape or on film or slides . These stations then add specific information about their own radio or television operations . Such presentations are effective ; in fact , it is doubtful whether many major department stores would have given serious consideration to the use of radio or television without them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , TvB or RAB can be of major assistance in supplying films , slides and audio tapes . Any station , no matter how small , should prepare its own supplements for each prospective client . Salesmen who have had the benefit of training or experience in radio or television production can be particularly valuable in this preparation . A tour of the station 's facilities , even if it is a small operation , can be very useful in explaining the station to the client . If conducted properly , it can make a strong impression on one who is not acquainted with the workings of a broadcasting station . If " name " talent is being considered in the retailer 's campaign , there should be an opportunity for the merchant to meet that talent . Such a meeting can be arranged during one of the sales talks with the client or at a luncheon or dinner . In most cases , it is advisable to recommend air personalities to large retailers because sponsored talent can be made available for store events or sales meetings and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted that we have said nothing about the use of ratings in the sales presentation . Unless a station is completely dominant in its market , its ratings will not be as important in making a sale as some broadcasters think they are . Most local retailers have a very modest amount of inter158 BROADCAST MANAGEMENT est in a station 's rating service . Their audience index is the cash register a day or two following the start of an advertising schedule . LOCAL SPONSORSHIP OF PROGRAMS VS . SPOT ANNOUNCEMENTS Throughout the development of radio , sponsorship in the aural medium was largely by program segments . This was extremely effective for both local and national accounts because it permitted the closest possible tie between a sponsor and a program vehicle . Whether it was Jack Benny for Jello or the late Pierre Andre on Captain Midnight for Ovaltine , the bridge of sponsorship made an indelible mark on the consumer . Television began with program sponsorship only to see the shift to more spot announcement concentration as costs of television mounted and as smaller or specialized advertisers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium . We have long been of the opinion that a retailer gains much more in his home community through program sponsorship on radio and/or television rather than by the use of spot announcements . We are not arguing against the merits of announcements in terms of their sales pull ; we are talking in terms of getting an audience reaction that will stimulate the community to express its response to a specific program . These reactions give store management an opportunity for correspondence with those consumers who may write letters . It also gives the management of the store , along with his buyers and other key personnel , further proof of the intimacy and effectiveness of radio and television . We have not noticed many letters that come to stations commenting on spot schedules or spot announcements . An outstanding example of successful use of programming is the experience of Oak Park Federal Savings and Loan , formerly a one office establishment in a large western suburb of Chicago , which purchased Chicago Cubs ' radio play-by-play over WGN ten years ago and has renewed each successive year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The total resources of the company grew from $70,000,000 to $140 , - 000,000 in a five-year period . It would seem that in both radio and television , the purchase of some programming is essential , especially if the vehicle involved is one that can reflect genuine credit beyond its basic entertainment or service value to the client . This applies generally to sports , news and programs featuring good music . Listeners and viewers go out of their way to buy well sponsored products and services . In some cases , it may be best to recommend institutional campaigns . Such is the case with the spot schedule of Carson , Pirie Scott &; Co. on some Chicago stations . Other than for particular sale periods , such as end of-month clearances , hack-to-school campaigns and pre- ( 'hristnia ? . // sales , Carsons devotes a very considerable amount of money throughout the year to promote its quality of service , conveniences for its customers , news about the expansion of various departments , additional stores added to its chain , etc . Here , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messages will reach . In the case of Carsons , or any major retailer , obviously the people at the store and its agency want to know the reputation of the station and its impact on the community before a purchase of advertising is made . Spot announcements can often be more effective over a given period of time on radio than on television , assuming , of course , that the right stations are bought . This is because radio is still very much a habit medium . Listeners tune in their favorite radio station in the morning and remain tuned all day , whether at home , in the car or on the beach . Television does not yet enjoy that kind of habitual audience . The television viewer is interested in programs and he tunes to the station that has the particular show he or she desires at a certain hour . Thus changing audience composition is important . The station or the agency that fails to take change into account is not honest with itself or with its advertisers . There are no hard and fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movers of some merchandise and services . They can be good reminder copy . On the other hand , for some big-ticket items , spots alone without program backing may prove ineffective . Some advertisers have soundly combined spot and program buys . The astute advertising manager of the Kitchens of Sara Lee designed a dual buy of network specials plus spot announcements on local television . On the network , Sara Lee is thus able to focus attention on its quality line through its selection of quality programs . The company sustains this major impact with a well balanced local spot schedule . This is good advertising ! Maxwell House Coffee elected to make a similar move but chose to concentrate on local stations where prestige program vehicles were available . The series , " Great Music , " was bought originally on WGN ? TV . The Maxwell House agency , Ogilvy , Benson &; Mather , wanted the client identified with the community through the sponsorship of a distinguished musical offering . While the audience was small in size , it was quality in every respect . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewers was solid . In Los Angeles , Maxwell House made similar moves to buy documentaries on a city 's problems , and the sponsorship of those specials was supported with good spot buys . FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS AFTER THE SALE Some salesmen resent the job of servicing a sale after it is made . These then would rather close a sale , forget about it and get started on another prospect . Such an attitude runs counter to the purposes of selling . As we 16o BROADCAST MANAGEMENT have said , the object of the sale in the first place is to perform a real service for the client . If the campaign is not successful , it will take more effort to get the advertiser back on the air than it did to sell him in the first place . While it is true that the servicing of accounts does not place immediate dollars in the salesman 's pockets , in the long run he stands to gain by it . The salesman interested only in his immediate financial gain is not really interested in what advertising can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sales claims that the station makes . His quick gain can be a long-time station loss . Traffic and Continuity Two indispensable units of any station in client service are traffic and continuity . Traffic is the very heart of the operating organization . Its primary responsibility is the preparation of the daily log showing all program and commercial placements minute by minute throughout each day . The people in traffic check for commercial separation of similar products , usually keeping two brand names for the same kind of product at least ten minutes ( the better stations allow fifteen minutes ) apart in the schedule . Traffic , at most stations , also prepares the weekly shift of assignments for all announcers and , in some cases , the assignment of turntable operators and even engineers , in unusual situations . The rate of the traffic department varies , of course , depending upon the size of the operation and whether or not a network affiliation is involved . Continuity , in addition to the writing of copy for the station , often is assigned the responsibility for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The checking to the station 's standards is another duty of those who work in continuity . Before a salesman makes any call on a client , he needs to check with the traffic unit at the station to learn what availabilities exist in the schedule for the immediate and long-range future . This is his only assurance that what he may sell will be placed on the station at specific times of the day .
