Five weeks ago , in the midst of the rioting that gripped the quiet city of Masan during Korea 's presidential elections , a 16-year-old student named Kim Chu Yul sortied out into Masan 's streets and never returned . The police claimed they knew nothing about him . But last week a Masan angler , fishing in the city 's harbor , brought up Kim Chu Yul 's bloated body . Still protruding from the corpse 's head was a fragment of one of the tear gas shells that Masan police had used in quelling the election-day riot . <P> As the news spread through Masan , 10,000 infuriated citizens , many of them high school students , flocked to the building where Kim 's corpse lay and demanded the body " so we can take it to Seoul and show it to the National Assembly . " When the authorities refused , the crowd ran amuck . Raging through the streets , shouting demands for the resignation of President Syngman Rhee , the rioters sacked Masan 's city hall , the local offices of Rhee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brewery that a local pol allegedly received as a bribe for switching his support to Rhee in the elections . <P> From the brewery-where they found stacks of leftover ballots marked for Rhee 's running mate , 63-year-old Vice President-elect Lee Ki Poong-the rioters moved on to Masan 's police headquarters , smashed through a police cordon and wrecked the station . When Masan 's police chief came driving up , infuriated women set fire to his Jeep and beat him so badly that at week 's end he was still in a coma . For the next two days , the students of Masan paraded ceaselessly through town bearing placards that read " Down with Fraudulent Elections " and " Can Freedom Gained Through Blood Be Taken Away by Bayonets ? " <P> Time to Apologize . Trading on the vast prestige that his 35-year fight for Korean freedom gave him with Korea 's masses , autocratic Syngman Rhee , 85 , has long ridden roughshod over anyone who dared oppose him politically . But in last month 's election , his party 's reliance on ballot stuffing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unprecedented proportions . Masan has long been a stronghold of opposition to Rhee 's Liberals . In 1956 the people of Masan gave Rhee only half as many votes as Progressive Party Candidate Cho Bong Am ( later hanged by Rhee 's police for treason ) . Masan 's voters flatly refused to believe that this time they had voted Liberal by nearly 3 to 1 . <P> Outraged by the election and the bloodshed it produced in Masan. more and more influential Koreans have found the courage to speak out against Rhee . After investigating the election-day riot in Masan , the Korea Bar Association reported : " Police deliberately sought to fabricate evidence of a Communist conspiracy by beating up arrested persons , including wounded ones , and telling them that unless they admitted to participating in a Communist plot , they would be tied in bags and thrown into the sea . " Last week , despite a " national security " law which provides penalties of up to ten years in jail for anyone who attacks Rhee , opposition members of the National Assembly denounced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chang Taik Sang : " Rhee should be told from this house to either retire gracefully or else to apologize to the people , saying ' Please spare me. ' "
