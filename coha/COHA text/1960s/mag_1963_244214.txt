Though two years still remain of his term , France 's President Charles de Gaulle has already let it be known that he will run for reelection . In Paris last week , another beret was thrown into the ring , that of breezy , competent Gaston Defferre , 53 , mayor of Marseille . <P> Defferre is the mysterious " Monsieur X " whose virtues as a candidate have recently been touted by the influential left-wing weekly L'Express . The description fitted Defferre so perfectly that few Frenchmen had any doubt whom L'Express had in mind . As the Monsieur X campaign boomed on , Gaullists began to squirm , and Defferre 's original resistance to the presidential fever weakened . <P> Even a Yacht . Some of Defferre 's fellow Socialists began to squirm as well . Uneasiest of all was Party Secretary Guy Mollet , who has long been jealous of Defferre 's growing power in the party and his even wider appeal to the nation . When the governing board of the Socialist Party met last week at its Paris headquarters just off Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naming anyone as a presidential candidate-at least at this moment . But of the 43 Socialists present at last week 's meeting , fully 35 backed Defferre and only eight stood with Mollet . It seems certain that Defferre will get full Socialist Party support at next February 's special congress . <P> The man who has emerged as De Gaulle 's major rival is nearly as unusual as le grand Charles himself . In a Roman Catholic country , Defferre is a Protestant . He is a co-owner of a prosperous newspaper , Le Provencal , and though a convinced Socialist , possesses one of those conspicuous bourgeois appurtenances , a yacht . An antiCommunist , Defferre nevertheless gets Communist support at elections . <P> Onetime Gaullist . Born at Marsi-llargues , 80 miles west of Marseille , Defferre took his law degree at Aix-en-Provence , joined the Resistance during the war , served for a time as a Gaullist in North Africa . After the Liberation , Defferre was elected mayor of Marseille , has served continuously in Parliament since 1946 , and was a decolonizer long before De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's African empire , was Defferre 's creation . <P> In Marseille , where Defferre lives with his attractive wife Marie-Antoinette in a villa overlooking the harbor , politics can be as rough as in Chicago . Handsome , greying Gaston Defferre plays rough when necessary but is mostly interested in results . During his ten years as mayor , Marseille , France 's second largest city ( pop . 778,000 ) , has balanced its budget , won the national blue ribbon for housing construction , and set up long-range city planning that may become a national model .
