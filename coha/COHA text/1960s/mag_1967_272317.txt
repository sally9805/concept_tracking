SOUTH KOREA <P> More than 250,000 people lined the sandy banks along the Susongchon River north of Pusan . " We should not delay the national task of modernizing Korea , " President Chung Hee Park , 49 , told them . " If we stop working now , Korea will waste another 20 years catching up . " One hundred fifty miles away in Seoul , Old Campaigner and ex-President ( 1960-62 ) Posun Yun , 69 , stirred another crowd of 250,000 by warning that Park 's economic policies were wrecking the country . What is more , Yun charged , Park 's government was " sick with corruption , irregularities and dictatorial authoritarianism . " <P> It was election time in South Korea , and on the eve of this week 's voting , the country echoed with the same names and many of the same words that it heard in the 1963 campaign . The difference is that in 1963 Park was the raw , untested military man who had seized power in 1961 , then traded in his khaki for mufti and taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere 156,000 votes of the 11,000,000 cast ( out of a population of 27 million ) . Going into this week 's elections , Park has four years of civilian government and a strong record working for him . <P> Progress &; Problems . Under the firm rule of Park 's Democratic Republican Party , Korea is emerging from its long years of isolation ( TIME , March 10 ) . Park has sent 46,000 troops to Viet Nam , promoted regional economic cooperation among the non-Communist Asian Pacific nations and normalized relations with Japan-a move that has proved worth $800 million in grants and credits . Park 's five-year development plan has sharply expanded foreign and domestic investment and , for the first time , started Korea on the road toward self-sufficiency . In the past five years , more than 3,600 new factories have been built , and another 18,000 small and medium-sized businesses have been set up , cutting unemployment from more than 11% in 1962 to a current 7% . <P> South Korea 's progress , however , is not without problems . There is widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt-poor countryside , millions of Koreans have yet to share in prosperity . Claiming that Park 's policies have only " made the rich richer and the poor poorer , " Yun has traveled the country from one end to the other , promising that if elected he will cut fertilizer prices and general taxes , raise tax exemptions and increase government salaries 50% . <P> Yun 's New Democratic Party will likely cut into Park 's rural support in this week 's election , but not enough to offset the government 's gains in the cities and along the eastern coast , where South Korea 's prosperity is most evident . Overall , Park is expected to increase his 1963 margin .
