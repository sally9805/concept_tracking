For a change , the Atlantic below , as well as the sky above , was crowded with tourists . Since 1957 , the last year before jets went into transatlantic service , ships have experienced a worrisome 25% decline in passengers . But reservations are now running about 6% ahead of last year , and such luxury liners as the France , Rotterdam and Cristoforo Colombo are booked solidly through mid-September .

This has now changed , and an estimated 30% of all Atlantic sea passengers this year will be traveling on the split ticket . <P> Savoring their new prosperity and enjoying once more the sight of long waiting lists , the ship lines are returning to an old and irritating habit of peak-season travel : overbooking . In the somewhat unrealistic fear of sailing with empty cabins because of late cancellations , at least one line has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive passengers back to the airplane.
