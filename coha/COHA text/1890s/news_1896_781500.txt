txt A trustworthy London paper explains the recent block of the cable betw ' - en Capetown and England by the statement that the innumerable congratulatory dispatches in which the South Africans endeavored to express their joy at ALFRED AUSTIN 'S selection as Laureate completely swamped the telegraph operators . This theory is obviously true . It is known , on the authority of Mr. AUSTIN himself , that he received bushels of such dispatches ; as they could have come from nowhere else , they must have come from the Cape . Why was it that the Rev. Mr. BOND , on discovering that only five of his parishioners agreed with him as to the sinfulness of dancing , instantly declared the intention of resigning ' his place as pastor ai of leaving New-Village to its fate ? If he considers the matter one of importance in an eschatological way , he can find no field where his exhortations and appeals are more needed than right there on Long Island . In most other places , and especially here in New-York , and in fashionable circles , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to dancing . Perhaps they do not regard it as wicked , but they do consider it tiresome , and the practical effect , if one may believe the laments of feminine unregenerates , is exactly what Mr. BOND desires  --  the abandonment of the practice . So he would find little to combat hardly anywhere except at New-Village , and , of course , a life of inglorious ease , however pleasant , is not what . he seeks . People will remark with some surprise that Col. IN:c.Easor.a. , who was supposed to ne an agnostic , declares that " of course , prayers are never answered . " This is a somewhat sweeping statement , and , judged even from his own point of view , can not be based on evidence any better than that which leads his clerical opponents to make assertions exactly the reverse of this one .
