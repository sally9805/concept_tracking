txt The President has finally made up his mind as to an extension of the classified service , and though it must not , we suppose , be taken as final , it is very important . it embraces all the free-delivery Post Offices , of which there are 601 , with only 53 now under the rules . The addition is , therefore , of 54S offices , with some 7,000 employes . Mr. has also brought under the rules all employes of the Weather Bureau outside of Washington , of whom there are some 140 . As we have said , this is au important step in advance , and the President deserves corresponding credit for having taken it . He would have deserved much more if he had taken it earlier , but we should be thankful that we have got this much even at so late a date . We still hope that before Mr. HARRISON retires he will extend the rules to all offices having twenty-five employes or more , and that he will bring under the sanction of the rules and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firmly applied by Secretary Titacv to the labor force of the Navy Department . The contest between Gov . AnnErr and JAMES SMITH , Jr. , for the Senatorship in New-Jersey is a peculiarly significant one . Mr. ABBk.:TT has striven to build up a machine after the manner of DAVID B. and it has been his settled purpose to secure the seat iu the Senate to be va:ated next March by Mr. BLODGETT . He has used all his official power and his influence as head of the machine to plornote that end , but his high-handed course has produced something like a popular revolt . The Democrats of the State gave his machine more than one serious check during the past year , and forced Gov . ABBETT himself into subjection on the question of supporting CLEVELAND for the Presidency . sir . SMITH holds no office and controis no machine , but he has the sagacity to recognize the course of popular sentiment and to see the importance of leading the people in the way they wish to go instead 7f driving or forcing them some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senatorship. and yet the dislike of AnsETT 's methods and the recognition of SMITH 'S regard for popular sentiment have made him a formidable candidate , with a fair proslea of defeating the Governor 's aspirations . The Army Appropriation bill , now pending in the Senate , is certainly a moderate measure , drawn carefully , and managed by Mr. OUTHWAITE during its passage through the House with such consummate tact as to have called out , we believe , only one proposal for the reduction of an item . That was to cut down by $10,000 the appropriation for buying horses , and this he promptly disposed of by offering a compromise of $5,000 , which was accepted . The bill calls for about $80,000 less than last year 's , and less than the average of the last half a dozen years ; and nevertheless it contrives to supply a very useful increase of $135,000 for ordnance stores and infantry , cavalry , and artillery equipments . This will furnish , among other things , some needed machinery for mounting guns and gun carriages on the various seaboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also allow an increase of the metallic ammunition for small arms , which in turn will probably insure a fuller supply for target practice . In fact , all these items of increase are gains for the efficiency of the army , and much skill seems to have been exercised in curtailing in some directions so as to permit increases in others . Should it be found that the former work was carried a little too far , revision in the Senate may rectify it . Mr. HEwrrr , in advocating larger facilities for the elevated roads , had dwelt upon the necessity of a loop at the Battery , a necessity which the Manhattan corporation itself has been urging for years . The Post pointed out that the necessity for such a loop would be obviated if the company wouldkeep its trains moving past South Ferry , instead of making that point a terminus . The Post is right enough abput this . Quite irrespectively of any question of extension , it is absurd that passengers going around the foot of the island , from Cortlandt or Chambers Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay two fares to the same corporation . The proper " loop " is the whole circuit of the city , from the western to the eastern terminus of the roads . The loss of income that would ensue from making this alteration would be trifling , and would gite evidence , which the Manhattan Company urgently needs , of a-desire to accommodate the public . The Legislature of Illinois passed a stringent Anti-Trust law nearly two years ago , and it went into effect on July 1 , 1891 . The law makes it the duty of the Attorney General of the State to enforce its provisions , but he has taken no action . The author of the law is a member of the new Legislature and he is disturbed in mind by the curious inactivity of this officer . Therefore he is about to introduce a resolution which asserts that " not a single prosecution has been commenced , " and directs the successor of the delinquent prosecutor to inquire and report as to the cause of this failure to perform a duty that was clearly imposed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the corporation laws of Illinois by Trust combinations . Several of the most notorious Trusts in the country are doing business under Illinois charters ' and some of these charters were procured after the passage of this statute . Even the Whisky Trust obtained a charter at Springfield . The two committees that emerged from the turmoil of Wednesday 's rapid-transit meeting at the Real Estate Exchange appeared before the Rapid-Transit Commission yesterday to urge their several views before that body , but it is doubtful if much effect was produced . One of these committees was in favor of the extension of the elevated railroad system , which the people of the city have for years shown that they do not want . The other appeared in behalf of real rapid transit , which the people do want and which the city greatly needs , and urged the policy of constructing the road planned by the commission at public expense and for the public benefit .
