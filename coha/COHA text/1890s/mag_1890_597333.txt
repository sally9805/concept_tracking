JUNE , 1890 . No. 2 . LONDON POLYTECHNICS AND PEOPLE 'S PALACES . NO American visitor who observes attentively the institutions and social life of the mother country can fail to be impressed with the marvelous tenacity and recuperative vigor of the English race in England . Such courage and virile buoyancy in the face of the gravest practical problems and in the certain prospect of a long period of turbulence , agitation , and social and political readjustment , the history of the world does not parallel . With the unbroken traditions of a very old country , England has all the vitality and constructive energy of a new one . There is no such thing visible as that racial exhaustion and declension the signs of which in some of England*s continental neighbors seem well-nigh unmistakable . No people in the world , not even the Americans or the Russians , seem farther from the " fagged out " pointthan the English . Their strength , in Scripture phrase , is as their day . They do not welcome change for the sake of change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But once fully convinced , they move with irresistible decision and force . Thus they continue from time to time to make the most important changes in their political constitution , each new change only preparing the way for the next one , and finality seeming still as remote as ever . They have led the world in the stupendous industrial achievements of the past century , and they seem not unlikely yet to lead the world in those social reforms that the modern economic system has made so necessary . It is to this idea that my prefatory remarks have been , somewhat tortuously , leading up . The agricultural depression and decline , the rapid growth of town populations living under lamentably unsuitable physical and moral conditions , the " bitter cry of outcast London , " the terrible misery in sweaters ' dens that recent investigations both official and unofficial have brought to light , the wretched plight of young women of the working classes by the hundred thousand , the anarchist leaven that begins to permeate the growing army of the unemployed - these things constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds and has been thought to forebode England 's decay and ruin . England was slow to appreciate the magnitude of the social problems which form the dark shadow of her industrial greatness , and her most zealous reformers would say that even yet she is only half awake to the situation . But at least she becomes more fully aroused and more thoroughly earnest every day , and is beginning to find and apply remedies in the practical English fashion . The evils of generations are not to be cured in a year or a decade , nor are they to succumb to the virtues of any single specific . The work of reform will be along many lines and through many agencies , all blending and harmonizing in the grand result . It seems to me clear that the significant fact in the social condition of England to-day is not to be found in the degradation and misery of a large part of the population , but rather in the vigor , whole-heartedness , and honest zeal with which the task of amelioration has been entered upon . Underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominations , and the controversies growing out of class distinctions and privileges , there is apparent on all sides and in all Copyright , 1890 , by THE CENTURY Co . All rights reserved . // QUINTIN HOOG. parts of English society a growing sense of justice and of human rights and brotherhood , and a growing sense of the necessity and the obligation that rests upon the community to make all its members sharers to the widest possible extent in the best fruits of modern civilization . The English people are making . the steadiest and most direct steps in the direction of socialism of any nation in the world . And they are doing this without either accepting or rejecting any theory as to the proper functions of the state or the municipal corporation . When it is perceived that a certain thing must be done , England proceeds to do it , using private and voluntary means , public and official means , or more commonly a combination of the two , in a manner peculiarly English and without the possibility of successful imitation anywhere else . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has that of artisans ' dwellings , various questions of sanitary concern , and still other things of which it is no part of my present purpose to make out a list . Every successive phase of the complicated social problem , so soon as it has fairly made its appeal to the public consciousness , becomes the subject of investigation by a royal or parliamentary commission . The report of the commission is usually a signal for action . In some cases - indeed , in many cases - the principal activity will not be through state channels , though under semi-public auspices and sanction . This British method of reform is remarkably illustrated by the great progress technical and prac tical education has made in England as the outcome , in large part , of the famous report of the royal commission on that subject in 1883 , although no legislation has as yet resulted from the report . The English people became conscious of the fact that they were behind the rest of the world in providing educational facilities to meet the new conditions of production and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While perceiving that their industrial supremacy was threatened by the superiority of other nations in technical training , they also began to perceive that the supplying of a useful , symmetrical , and thoroughly practical education would prove a measure of social reform of the very largest consequence . There was developed an immense enthusiasm for technical education , many different ideas and schemes being covered by the term . Societies were formed , money was given , old foundations and endowments were reformed and made applicable to the new work , and the most sagacious minds joined in the task of devising the best sort of practical education for the young people of England under present circumstances . As a result , there is just now beginning to emerge something like the definite outlines of a distinctively English system of practical education . I know of no other single thing which promises to do so much in that grand work of social improvement to which England stands deliberately committed as the scheme of popular education-mental , moral , physical , technical , and recreative - that begins to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and expansion within the coming decade . The English people have taken the trouble to study the experience of the entire industrial world in this matter of practical education , but they have studied their own circumstances with equal fidelity , and their system will be essentially their own . .1 d * I CL Y I II* NiT TI 5 IN*2 ON$* * THE POLYTECHNIC IN EEGENT STEENT. r // It is not my present purpose , however , to discuss the technical education movement in general , but rather to describe a particular phase of it in London , which is a very essential part of the general movement , and perhaps the most significant and characteristic part . While the social and educational aspects of the movement I purpose to describe seem more conspicuous than its relations to the in by degrees , has discovered certain main principles by a large and careful induction , and seems as well adapted to the ends it has in view as the Bank of England or any other piece of machinery . It can best be described in the concrete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the wise and pervasive autocracy of its founder , Mr. Quintin Hogg . Mr. Hogg , who is still in the vigorPOLYTECHNIC ATHLETIC MEETING AT PADDINGTON . dustrial progress and supremacy of the country , it is nevertheless true that the more complete is its success from the former standpoint the more important will it be from the other point of view . If the country can raise up men and women of highly improved efficiency and capacity , its great industries need fear no rivals . What I have called in the title of this article the " people 's palaces " of London would perhaps better be called the " polytechnic institutes " of London . Neither name is completely descriptive . Of the two institutions which stand as the pioneers and models in a group now rapidly forming , one is called by one name and one by the other . The name " polytechnic institute " implies a great school where many crafts and trades are taught . The name " people 's palace " would suggest a place of luxury , recreation , anddelight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good working plan . The " polytechnic , " as now definitely understood and accepted in London , is not an off-hand invention , or an experiment suddenly blossoming out of somebody 's beautiful theory and likely to collapse at any time . Ithas grown ous prime of life , is one of the great merchants of London . His father was once a chairman of the East India Company , and the son owns sugar and coffee plantations in Demerara , and is the head of a large West India firm . There is not the faintest suspicion of the typical philanthropist about him , and perhaps that is one reason why his philanthropic work has been so singularly successful . Ever since his schooldays at Eton , twenty-five years ago , Mr. Hogg has given his evenings and Sundays to enterprises under his own management for the welfare of the boys and young men of London . The Young Men 's Christian Association did not , and does not , reach the apprentices and artisan classes among whom Mr. Hogg found his mission . He began with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system into something better suited to the nature and needs of the lads with whom he had to deal . Religion and the three R 's are excellent things for poor boys and apprentices , in London and everywhere else , but they do not form a sufficient equipment . The boy has a body which needs development by proper physical training ; his mind and character as *iv // well as his muscles need the valuable education that manly sports and recreations give ; and his success as a breadwinner requires instruction and training in the line of his calling as auxiliary to the practical knowledge and skill acquired from day to day in the shop . I am giving Mr. Hogg 's ideas as I understand them . Educated himself in one of the famous English schools where athletic sports and contests have so much to do with the development of physical strength and moral character in the young men of the higher classes , Mr. Hogg quickly appreciated the lack of opportunities for games and recreations among the working lads of the metropolis . As a practical man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our modern industrial conditions of the old apprentice system , and the necessity for systematic instruction to supplement though not to supersede the education of the shop . With all this he believed that religious instruction should remain a part of the scheme , and that it would gain rather than lose by the presence of the other parts . Thus Mr. Hogg 's ragged schQols in the Drury Lane neighborhood developed into a home for boys in which regard was had to every side of the juvenile nature . In 1873 there was added to this earlier work an institute devised for older boys ,  --  those from sixteen up into the twenties ,  --  which was intended to adapt , modify , and expand the Young Men 's Christian Association idea into suitability for the working class ; in short , into an educational and recreative club that should in its attractiveness and its solid advantages be able to draw away young artisans from evil surroundings . Opened first in Endell street , the institute was soon transferred to Long Acre , where , in spite of inadequate accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his assistants the benefit of nearly ten years experience as a preparation for the larger work that was to be undertaken at a later day . The opening for which Mr. Hogg had been " biding his time came in 1882 . The old Polytechnic Institution in Regent street was thrown upon the market , having failed in its original purposes and become an unprofitable property . It had been opened in 1838 , and had been a place where children of the upper classes were taken to hear popular-science lectures , to see shoxvy chemical experiments , and to be amused with all sorts of novel and astonishing things . Children from the country were taken to the Polytechnic as a matter of course , just as they are now , as a matter of course , taken to the Crystal Palace . But as superior attractions came into the field the Polytechnic degenerated . It went into theatricals , and failed . Mr. Hogg seized the opportunity to buy the great building , paying for it about $250,000 . At considerable further expense he altered it and fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men 's Christian Institute , " and then removed to its new quarters the institute which since 1873 had been doing good work in Long Acre . When I say that from its opening in 1882 to the end of 1889 the Regent street Polytechnic has had enrolled as members or students a total attendance of more than seventy thousand , and that its present yearly number of from twelve to thirteen thousand is limited only by the physical capacity of the establishment , it will be evident that it has earned the right to demand public attention . Primarily the institute is a club . It has all the adjuncts of a completely appointed club , and a definite membership as such . To this primary organization is added a great variety of educational facilities , available for members of the club at reduced prices , but also available for outsiders at certain fixed tuition charges for each class or course . These educational departments are for those who are at work during the day and who desire to improve their minds in the evening . But the establishment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better classes , whose tuition fees are large enough to be a source of net revenue , and thus to aid in carrying on the main work . There are also certain special classes and lecture courses open during the day , to which I shall refer in a subsequent paragraph . Membership in the institute is restricted to young men from sixteen to twenty-five . I do not mean that there is any retiring age , but that applicants will not be received as new members if they have passed the age of CLASS IN PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE POLYTECHNIC . // twenty-five . Older men may join the classes and have the educational advantages of the Polytechnic , but they are debarred from participating in the social and recreative features that belong to the club side of the establishment . This is a perfectly sensible limitation . It is not the object of the place to furnish club facilities to mature men , nor would their presence in considerable numbers be advantageous for the younger members . Nor is the place suited to lads under fifteen or sixteen . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully grown young men . Upon no point are Mr. Hogg and his efficient secretary , Mr. Mitchell , more fully satisfied by their experience than upon this point of classification by ages . The present number of active , paid-up members is 3500 . The annual membership fee is twelve shillings ( $3.00 ) if paid quarterly , and ten and a half shillings if paid in advance . The membership would be much larger if the rooms could accommodate all who desire to join . Membership entails no duties or responsibilities , and gives many privileges . It entitles to the use of all the clubrooms and facilities of the place , and gives admission to such classes as the member may choose to attend at about two-thirds the regular class fees . The social and refreshment room is one of the first the visitor will be likely to see . It is sixty feet long by forty-eight feet wide , and is the general lounging and rallying place . It contains a refreshment-bar , where members may order a cup of tea or a substantial supper at very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , the latest notices of the various athletic clubs are posted on bulletin-boards , such games as chess and draughts are permitted for those who like them , and the place has an air of a very comfortable and hospitable living-room for a club of democratic but decent young men . Opening from the social room is a smaller club-room where committees and sections can meet to arrange for rowing events , foot-ball matches , or other affairs of interest and moment . Easily accessible is the lending library , of several thousand volumes , freely at the service of all the members ; and in a separate room about forty feet square is the reading library , supplied with books , reference works , and a large number of standard periodicals . The great gymnasium , a hundred feet long and forty feet wide , is an especially popular feature , and nearly two thousand members avail themselves of it regularly enough to pay the small locker rent of eighteen pence per half-year . Excellent instruction is given by well-qualified and certificated army teachers . The swimming-bath is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated tiles . Its dimen sions are seventy-eight by thirty-five feet . In the winter it is floored over and carpeted and used for reading , writing , and lecture-hall purposes , although the establishment is otherwise provided with a large lecture hall in amphitheater form that will accommodate perhaps 1500 or i8oo auditors . Of the band-practice room , the barber 's shop , and the various minor conveniences that pertain to the place in its character as a club , I need not say anything . The recreative side of life at the Polytechnic is no mild pretense , but a very robust reality . The young men who go in for sports join the athletic club and pay five shillings a year towards the prizes and incidental outlays . The club has an active membership of 500 or 6oo , and is divided into sub-sections of cricketers , foot-ball men , tennis players , rowing men , cyclists , pedestrians , harriers , and perhaps others - individuals belonging , of course , to as many of these sections as they may choose . Mr. Hogg has provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merton Hall , with nearly thirty acres of land , and it has been converted into a cricketing ground and general play-ground that is , I am told , the finest in the kingdom . Mr. J. E. K. Studd , the famous cricketer and muscular Christian of Cambridge UiiW*rsity , has become one of Mr. J. E. K. STUDD . Hogg 's right-hand men in two parts of the Polytechnic work , namely , the sporting and the religious . He is captain of the Polytechnic 's " first eleven , " which is one of the most formidable teams in the country . The athletic club had about sixteen cricket teams at last accounts , and a number of foot-ball teams with good records in the English contests for cups and honors . The rowing club is the largest on the Thames , and is accommodated in a fine // new boat-house , there being nearly two hundred rowing men . The cycling club numbers from fifty to a hundred " machines , " and the rambling club , which makes Saturday halfholiday excursions to the innumerable points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more men . The tennis players have the best of grounds at Merton Hall , and number not less than a hundred . It must be remembered that many hundreds who do not join in the active sports are nevertheless getting regular physical training in the gymnasium , and find their recreation from daily duties , which perhaps involve a good deal of bodily exercise , in the numerous other societies which are as intimately connected with the Polytechnic as the athletic club . The young men who are of a musical turn may join the Polytechnic Male Choir , the Choral Society , the English Concertina Band , the Orchestral Society , or the Military Band , all of which are large and prosperous , and require a considerable amount of preliminary musical knowledge , which may be obtained in the Institute 's music classes . The German Society and the French Society are composed of young men who have taken the class work in those languages and can speak with some fluency . The Chess and Draughts Club is comp6sed of the first-rate players . The Mutual Improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debating club for the training of young politicians . The Polytechnic " E " company ( West London Rifles ) , 4th Middlesex , is the strongest and best company of volunteers in the corps . The Polytechnic battery of the ist City of London Artillery Volunteers , the Polytechnic company of the ist Middlesex Engineers , and the Polytechnic contingent in the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps , are all just sources of pride to the institution . I can only name such useful organizations as the Polytechnic Engineering Society , the Electrical Engineering Society , the Typographical Society , and societies of various trades and *r*afts for the discussion of the more advance*nd theoretical topics affecting their respective callings . For all these organizations of its members , most of which meet weekly , the Polytechnic manages to find convenient quarters . The arrangement of classes in the educational department of this Polytechnic , as of numerous schools throughout Great Britain , is made with reference to the requirements of two important central organizations that grant subsidies under certain conditions . One of these is the Science and Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful instruction in certain specified subjects , chiefly of a scientific character . The other is the City and Guilds of London Institute , which gives subsidies for successful instruction in technical subjects . The Polytechnic 's evening classes may then be grouped as : ( i ) science classes , ( 2 ) technical classes , ( 3 ) practical workshop classes , ( 4 ) general and commercial classes , ( * ) art classes , and ( 6 ) music classes . The young student does not , however , concern himself with this or any other classification , but with the help and adTHE MILE END NOAD. // vice of the managers and teachers he makes out a programme for himself on the free elective plan . The science classes , nearly all of which are large , include such subjects as chemistry , geometry , general mathematics , general mechanics , building construction , machine construction , geology , botany , physiology , mineralogy , steam , electricity , and others , there being four or five separate classes in some of these subjects . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , geometrical drawing , modeling in wax and clay , designing and decorative art , wood carving , etching , chasing and repouss* , etc . All these classes come under the inspection of the Science and Art Department , and " earn** in grants perhaps half what they cost , the other half being mainly met by the pupils ' fees . The technical classes include subjects recognized in the scheme of the City and Guilds Institute ; and among the principal ones in which advanced and theoretical instruction is given at the Polytechnic are carpentry , cabinetmaking , carriage-building , brickwork , plumbing , boqt-making , metal-plate work , toolmaking , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , printing , photography , watchmaking , oils and varnishes , and surveying . In deference to the trades unions and also to the regulations of the City and Guilds Institute , these technical classes are restricted to young men actually in the trades . Apprentices and young journeymen here have the privilege of learning those scientific principles affecting their trades that shop instruction alone could not adequately supply . The practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are restricted to young men already in the trades , include carpentry and cabinet work , staircase work , brick cutting and arch work , machine and iron work , wood-carving , pattern-maliing , sign-writing , plumbing , watch-making , metal-chasing , brass-finishing , electrical work , upholstery , and tailors ' cutting . It is an easier matter to give a list of these classes than to convey an adequate idea of their usefulness and efficiency , or of the scenes of animation and interest that arouse the enthusiasm of the visitor , whether in the social room , the swimining-bath , the gymnasium , or the workshops . In the machine room I found one young man engaged in making a three-horse-power horizontal engine with which to drive his lathe , as he was about to set up for himself in business . Other young men were making a launch engine . Another was at work upon a dynamo . Tools , lathes , gas engines , and much of the machinery with which the shop itself is equipped were shown me as the work of pupils and members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 23. in all these technical departments must themselves be men of thoroughly practical as well as theoretical knowledge . Electrical , physical , and chemical laboratories are much the same everywhere , and no description of those in the Polytechnic is necessary . They have an added interest , however , when occupied by young men of the working classes who give their evenings to the pursuit of science . In the art rooms , under enthusiastic teachers , one finds pupils drawing from the antique , modeling from copied or original designs in clay , wax , and plaster , working out architectural details , and studying both the principles of design and their technical applications to the industrial arts for wood and stone carvers ; for workers in gold , silver , pottery , steel , and brass ; for molding and ceiling designers ; for designers of patterns for wall paper , carpets , and calicoes ; and for other workers in the widening field of decorative and technical art . The commercial and general classes cover all such subjects as arithmetic , bookkeeping , grammar , penmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition , besides special training classes for civil service , pharmacy , ambulance corps , and other examinations . The music department has a number of vocal and instrumental classes . The fullest allowance is made for the fact that boys and young men who work hard all day long can not with impunity spend all their evenings in severe study or in shop-room work . The same individuals are , as a rule , not to be found in the chemical laboratory or the machine shop more than from one to three evenings in the week . In many of the technical and scientific subjects the instruction per week to each individual is limited to one hour , and the same thing is true of the commercial and general subjects . Instruction is , however , so distributed that any individual may cull out * quite as full a course as he has time for , md by a combination of scientific and technical subjects may make the whole course bear strongly in the direction of his trade , supplying just those broadening and valuable elements of knowledge which supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school is a wholly distinct affair . It is for younger pupils who come from the middle class rather than the working class ,  --  these class distinctions being sharply drawn in England ,  --  and it accommodates about five hundred boys of from seven to sixteen years of age . The younger boys are in an elementary department , while the older ones are in the technical and commercial departments , or are preparing for college or professional courses or civil-service examinations . Two or three hundred boys are in the techni // cal department , and they spend the forenoons in ordinary school-room work and the afternoons in the shops learning the principles of mechanical trades . An English boy usually leaves the elementary schools at about thirteen , and goes to his trade . He is too likely to forget what he has learned , and in his new surroundings to lose both education and character . If he could be kept at school two or three years longer , preparing for his trade while carrying his general studies further , it would be immeasurably to his advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " improver , instead of an apprentice , and reach thejourneyman 's status earlier rather than later and with very superior qualifications . Mr. Hogg 's day technical school purposes to supply this desirable continuation of study for the " fifthstandard " boy leaving the public elementary schools . At fifteen or sixteen he is ready to go to his trade , and he will have formed associations and acquired tastes which may be counted upon to bring him into the evening recreations and advanced classes of the Polytechnic . Could there be a more promising scheme than this for the training of skilled mechanics and complete men ? The tuition for this day school is rather high , averaging about $30 a year . This would seem to put its advantages beyond the reach of many mechanics who might appreciate them and desire them for their sons . The evening-class fees average about $* per session for each study to members of the institute and about $1.50 to others . In some subjects they are much less , while in a few special and technical subjects they are much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the wisdom of charging fees . These institutions are not to be regarded as charity affairs , although the fees do not suffice to pay all expenses . The young men and women value their opportgnities more highly and use them more faithfully when they are required to pay something substantial for what they get . These young mechanics and clerks are neatly dressed and respectable , and it would be a blunder to give them palaces of knowledge , recreation , and social enjoyment without asking anything from them in return . They are not mendicants , and are glad to pay their way . From the outset , young women were admitted to the art classes and some other of the educational advantages of the Polytechnic , but not until the early spring of i888 did Mr. Hogg see the way clear to provide for young working-women those social and recreative advantages which in London they need even more , if possible , than young men . To do these things on a large scale requires a heavy initial investment , and payments for deficits from year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one liberal man 's part in sustaining the Young Men 's Institute , Mr. Hogg has now opened a Polytechnic Young Women 's Christian Institute in Regent street , a few doors removed from the other establishment . The buildings leased for young women were not sufficient properly to accommodate more than eight hundred , although a thousand girls promptly enrolled themselves as members , and the number could have been increased many fold if there had been room for them . The buildings have undergone extension , however , and now it is possible to accommodate at least a thousand members . The age limit is from sixteen to twenty-five . The institute is open every evening , except Sundays , from 6:30 to 10 . Eighteen pence per quarter , or five shillings per annum , entitles members to the advantages of the social rooms , reading and writing rooms , sewing-rooms , and parlors , and also gives them the right to attend the concerts , lectures , and entertainments in the great hall of the Polytechnic at members ' rates . The swimming-bath is reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they have the benefit of reduced tuition rates in all the ordinary Polytechnic classes and in a number of special classes for young women only . Among these special classes are included elementary subjects , bookkeeping , short-hand , French , German , the piano , violin , and other musical instruments , dressmaking , millinery , plain and art needlework and mantle making , and cookery . This establishment for young women is an " annex** of the older and larger one for young men , the two being co5perative and coincident so far as is found feasible . The social rooms of which the young ladies have the liberty are homelike and pleasant , and the place has been in every way a brilliant success from its opening day . The young women are so fortunate as to have much personal attention from Mrs.Hogg , whose devotion to their welfare is as great as that of her husband to his thousands of young men . The religious features of the life at the Polytechnic , while voluntary and unobtrusive , have evidently a pervasive and wholesome influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lasting just fifteen minutes . On one evening of the week Mrs. Hogg conducts a large Bible class . Of the Sunday services , Mr. Hogg himself takes charge . He conducts a Bible class on Sunday afternoon , attended regularly by from *oo to 700 young men , and sometimes by a much larger number . A Sunday evening service in the large hall has the special attraction of music by the Polytechnic Male Choir and the Orchestra , and it draws a congregation of // some fifteen hundred . Rooms are set apart for the Polytechnic 's " Christian Workers ' Union , " which simply ranks as one of the many voluntary , self-governed societies of which an account has already been given . Its work is much like that of the Young Men 's Christian Association , and it is announced by its secretary as existing for Polytechnic members " of all religious denominations interested in Christian work ; having special rooms and library for preparation for Sunday-school and other classes , monthly conferences , temperance and social gatherings , open-air work , tract distributing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is also an active " Polytechnic Total Abstinence Society . " In the religious work Mr. Hogg and Mr. Mitchell take just as positive an interest as in any other part of the Polytechnic scheme . They include the spiritual in that symmetrical development at which their efforts are aimed . In the young women 's department Bible classes are conducted on Sunday afternoons and one week-day evening by Mrs. Hogg and Mr. Studd . Although desiring to keep my sketch of the Polytechnic within due limits , I must add that it publishes a weekly journal called the " Polytechnic Magazine , " which is found an indispensable feature ; that it has a savings bank which pays four and a half per cent . on deposits , and offers Mr. Hogg 's personal guaranty as security to the depositors ; that it provides accident insurance ; and that one of its most important features - considering its constituency of thousands of young men in a great city - is the " sick fund . " This mutual benefit society is one of the largest organizations in the Polytechnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitles them in case of sickness to a sufficient weekly cash allowance , besides the attendance of one of the forty or more physicians of standing living in all parts of Londor* who constitute the medical staff ; with other advantages , such as free medicines , and admission to hospital if necessary , a sum sufficient for burial expenses being also paid in case of death . It is needless to say that all such good features as this - and from time to time new ones are devised-bind young men to the Polytechnic , and that each part strengthens the whole . Besides giving his unremitting personal attention ,  --  no small sacrifice on the part of a man of his high social position and absorbing business affairs ,  --  Mr. Hogg has since 1882 invested in the Polytechnic more than half a million dollars . Of this great sum , $300,000 in round figures has gone into the buildings and their equipment , and $200,000 has gone into the cost of current maintenance . The Polytechnic has a large staff of carefully selected specialists for its corps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest popular universities in the world , without any endowments and without burdensome fees . He is a sound financier , and spends not a penny in needless or extravagant ways ; for , while a man of large business and means , there is a limit to his fortune , and he does not roll up the Polytechnic 's expense account for the mere pleasure of paying annual deficits . He has managed to keep the current yearly outlay down to about $70,000 , of which the income of the day school and the various fees of the members and pupils return $40,000 , leaving a deficiency of $30,000 , which Mr. Hogg has been paying out of his own pocket from year to year . If invested permanently in English coii. *ls , an . endowment fund of $1,200,000 would be required to yield an income equal to the sum paid yearly by Mr. Hogg to keep his institute going at full capacity . At a later point in this article I shall have occasion to refer to plans for the endowment of this model institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has borne , single-handed , so magnificently and without any signs of growing weary in well-doing . And now I shall turn to another brilliantly successful institution . A variety of circumstances have combined to give the " People 's Palace , " recently opened in East London , a more extended and popular sort of fame than the Regent Street Polytechnic has acquired . The People 's Palace needed skillful advertising , because it was dependent upon gifts and upon a thoroughly aroused interest in its objects for the means to erect its buildings and enter upon its work . The Polytechnic happened to have for its founder and manager a man with the means to pay its bills , as well as the skill and devotion to make it successful . The " Beaumont Institute , " better known by its other name of the " People 's Palace for East London , " is the outcome in very large part of the efforts of a man who , though he could not pay the bills himself , is one of the most princely beggars of modern times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to carry on the great institution he has built up . Sir Edmund Hay Currie is a very remarkable man . All his life he has been identified with East London , his business interests lying in that quarter . And all his life he has been interested in educational and philanthropic matters , in hospitals , and in the welfare of the masses generally . He distinguished himself in Crimean hospital management . He was chairman of the committee that provided for the extraordinary requirements of East London at the time of the great cholera epidemic . In a like capacity , when East London was scourged by small-pox , // he took thousands of cases to an improvised hospital camp quarantined on a hillside in Kent . When the once great ship-building industry of East London succumbed to competition elsewhere , bringing terrible hardship upon thousands of families , Sir Edmund organized the necessary work of relief . The principal hospital of East London was at one time languishing for funds ; Sir Edmund came to the rescue , and his irresistible tactics and energy as a beggar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural endowments of enthusiasm and energy , such capacity for organization , and so thorough a knowledge of the field and the people , gave up everything else in order to devote himself to the working out of a scheme for a great recreative and educational institution in East London , it was reasonable to look for results . For providing the nucleus of the People 's Palace funds credit should be given to John B. Beaumont , who died about 1840 , leaving money the income of which was to be spent in promoting the education and entertainment of the people in the neighborhood of Beaumont Sqjiare , his East End property . The Beaumont fund wrought a certain amount of good for some years , after which the testator 's survivors who were in charge seem to have got the property into a bad shape , and to have brought its usefulness quite to an end . Application was made to the Charity Commissioners of England , an important official body who have large powers of supervision and readjustment over charitable endowments , to rescue the Beaumont fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Currie , as chairman of the newly appointed Beaumont trustees , was able to recover for its legitimate objects about $6o , ooo of the money originally devised . This sum was not large enough to set on foot any important enterprise , and afI*er several years Sir Edmund in 1881 persuaded his colleagues of the Beaumont Trust to allow him to undertake the collection of $250,000 additional , with which to establish an institution of some magnitude . His courage has been amply rewarded , for the People 's Palace has secured gifts and endowments worth at least twice that sum . Sir Edmund 's financial undertaking was aided by events and publications which gave the prosperous and aristocratic people of the l*Test End their first conception of the condition and needs of East London , with its great neglected plebeian population . Mission workers and social reformers had discovered the existence of East London , and were beginning to make their discovery known . But still more timely for Sir Edmund 's inchoate project was the discovery of East London by a popular novelist . Mr. Walter Besant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autumn of 1882 . In his preface Mr. Besant tells us that he had undertaken many wanderings in the previous summer " in Stepney , Whitechapel , Poplar , St. George's-in  --  the East , Limehouse , Bow , Stratford , Shadwell , and all that great and marvelous unknown country which we call East London , " and that he found there " many wonderful things , and conversed with many wonderful people . " In the body of the book he mentions Stepney Green as being " in that region of London which is less known to Englishmen than if it were in the wildest part of Colorado or among the pine forests of British Columbia , . . . a strip of Eden which has been visited by few indeed of those who do not live in its immediate vicinity . " Two millions of people , or thereabouts says one of the descriptive passages in this fascinating novel , live in the East End of London . That seems a goodsized population for an utterly unknown town . They have no institutions of their own to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no municipality , no gentry , no carriages , no soldiers , no picture-galleries , no theaters , no opera - they have nothing . It is the fashion to believe that they are all paupers , which is a foolish and mischievous belief , as we shall presently see . Probably there is no such spectacle in the whole world as that of this immense ; neglected , forgotten great city of East London . It is even neglected by its own citizens , who have never yet perceived their abandoned condition . They are Londoners , it is true , but they have no part or share of London ; its wealth , its splendors , its honors , exist not for them . They see nothing of any splendors ; even the Lord Mayor 's show goeth westward ; the City lies between them and the greatness of England . They are beyond the wards , and can not become aldermen ; the rich London merchants go north and south and west ; but they go not east . Nobody goes east ; no one wants to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life in the east . Books on London pass it over ; it has little or no history ; great men are not buried in its churchyards , which are not even ancient , and crowded by citizens as obscure as those who now breathe the upper airs about them . If anything happens in the east , people at the other end have to stop and think before they can remember where the place may be . Nothing short of personal inspection and study will give one so good an idea of " the east " and its ways of living and thinking as Mr. Besant 's novel . The truth of fiction is in such matters superior to the truth of statistics . Yet statistics may tell us much , and I am inclined to give the summary findings of a most exceptionally thorough inquiry into the social and industrial condition of East London made recently by Mr. Booth , of the Statistical Society , and presented in an elaborate paper which appeared in the Society 's journal for June , // 73 i888 . The districts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not enter in a detailed way into this gentleman 's classification ; suffice it to say that by " the poor " he means those below the line of full self-support . Within the poverty line he finds 35.2 per cent . of the population , which he further distributes into four classes , as follows : ( A ) the lowest class , loafers , semi-criminals , etc. , 5.2 per cent. ; ( B ) the " very j5oor , " whose earnings are only casual , i i .2 per cent. ; ( C ) intermittent earnings , 8.3 per cent. ; and ( D ) small regular earnings , 14.5 per cent. ,  - -  the last two classes constituting " Ike poor " and being never wholly independent of public relief . Class E , composed of those who have regular standard workingmen 's earnings above the poverty line , includes 42.3 per cent . The higher labor class ( F ) numbers 13.6 per cent . The " lower middle class " ( G ) is 3.9 per cent. , and the " upper middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A classification by callings shows 22.3 per cent , to belong to the " common labor " class ; 23 per cent . to the " artisan " class , engaged in the building trades and mechanical pursuits ; 9 per cent . engaged in " dress and food " preparations ; 9 per cent . classified as " sundry wage ea*rs , " including workmen VOL . XL. - 24. on the highways , shop assistants , seamen , etc. ; 10.7 per cent. , small-profit earners  --  the keepers of small shops , stalls , hawkers , etc. ; 2.8 per cent. , large-profit earners - the keepers of larger mercantile establishments ; 5.3 per cent. , clerks and the " sub-professional class " ; .5 per cent. , professional ; .2 per cent. , those of independent means  --  the residue being made up of those who have no occupations or are not earning a regular livelihood . These figures , in conjunction with Mr. Besant 's descriptions and sketches from the life , may well give some adequate idea of the dullness and dreariness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social , educational , and recreative diversions that break the monotony of the workaday routine and help to make life really worth the living . Mr. Besant 's novel is the story of an ingenuous and clever young gentleman and a lovely and fabulously rich young lady who were quixotic enough to leave the drawing-room life of the west and to devote themselves to the welfare of the east . They planned and built a great " Palace of Delight , " with concert-halls , reading-rooms , picture-galleries , an art and design school , and various classes , social rooms , and frequent fetes and dances . THE HALL , PEOPLE S PALACE . // They threw it freely open to the people , gave the people large share in its management , and made it a great recreative center . On the titlepage Mr. Besant calls his book " an impossible story , " explaining in the preface that he had done this in deference to certain friendly advisers , who had told him it was " impossible " ; he adds , however , " But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would be an error to suppose that Mr. Besant was indebted for his plot to the then incubating project of the Beaumont trustees ; for his work was done and given to the world before he had heard anything whatsoever of that project . On the other hand , the trustees would not fail to acknowledge their obligations to Mr. Besant , both for ideas and also especially for the aroused attention of people of wealth and position . The novel appealed most strongly to the imagination . It was evidently a book with a purpose , written with strong conviction . The novel gave the " People 's Palace " its name , gave the project a great impulse , brought money and influence , and undoubtedly gave emphasis and prominence to the entertainment side of the Beaumont plan . But in the working out of the plan as a whole , and in the arrangement of practical details , the trustees of the Beaumont fund , who also became the People 's Palace trustees , very wisely relied upon the experience and advice of Mr. Hogg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell 's services were incessant and invaluable . The People 's Palace is very fortunate in its location . It is in the Mile End Road , which , as a continuation of the Whitechapel Road , is the great thoroughfare of East London . The horse-cars come to it from north , south , east , and west , not to mention innumerable omnibus lines . As Sir Edmund says , " The net was put down in the right place . " Immediately north is the populous district of Bethnal Green ; on the south lies Stepney , St. George's-in-theEast , Limehouse , and Ratcliffe ; on the west , all of Whitechapel ; and to the east are the unknown regions of Bow , Bromley , and Stratford . Five acres of land were secured at this strategic&gt; point , and the main hall of the centrafl5iiiTding , called " Queen 's Hall , " was opened by the Queen in person on May 14 , 1887 . The active work of the Palace was begun on October 3 , some old buildings on the ground being fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also quite temporary in character , being constructed for gymnasium , exhibition , refreshment , swimming-bath , office , and various other rooms . The Queen 's Hall is a great room , with vaulted ceiling , showily decorated , and imposing in its appearance . It has a fine organ , a large stage for the Palace 's chorus and orchestra , and audience accommodation for four thousand people . In June , i888 , the free library and reading-room THE READING-ROOM , PEOPLE 'S PALACE . // was opened . It is immediately behind the Queen 's Hall , with a separate entrance . It is a huge , eight-sided room , with space around the walls for 250,000 books , and with room at the tables for many hundreds of readers . Donations , largely from publishers and authors , have already accumulated to the extent of about 20,000 volumes ; and nearly all of the newspapers and periodicals which are to be found at the tables are sent free . Among the largest donors to the funds of the Palace is the Drapers ' Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not join the others in the formation of the City and Guilds Institute which carries on so large a work in behalf of technical education . The Drapers subscribed to the People 's Palace fund $20,000 a year for ten years ,  --  half of which should be invested as endowment ,  --  and also gave an additional $ioo , ooo for the building of the permanent technical schools . These schools flank the main building on the east , and were opened in October , i888 . Externally the Palace has anything but a palatial appearance as yet , the front not having been completed . This front part will be a great semicircle , covering the main hall , the technical schools , and the buildings on the west side that will correspond with the schools on the east . The front will have three stories , the lowest one being a newspaper and rendezvous room , with especial reference to the wants 75 of men who consult the papers for employment advertisements ; and there is no reason why there should not be conducted employment agencies on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the uppermost floor the art school will find its habitat . To the rear on the west will be a winter garden , inclosed in glass , full of palms and flowers and tropical fruits , communicating with the library and the Queen 's Hall . The permanent gymnasium and swimming-bath will occupy a detached building just west of the principal pile . This description must answer for the buildings ; which , I may add , will have a great variety of minor appointments and facilities for the various departments of the work . In describing briefly the work of the Palace , I shall observe the following order : ( i ) The recreative features , or the Palace in relation to the general population of East London ; ( 2 ) the social features , or the Palace in relation to its own membership ; ( * ) the educational features , or the Palace in relation to those who join its classes ; and ( * ) the technical day school for boys . The happiness and edification of the general population has from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It touches one 's heart to find out how little pleasure these people have . There is an absolute dearth of amusement in their part of the town . Nobody lives in East Lon THE READING-ROOM , PEOPLE S PALACE . // don who can help it , the better class of retail tradesmen who do business there living in the country . Many of the people , even the elderly folk , have never seen green fields . One might expect to find the cheap variety theaters flourishing in those quarters , but they are wholly lacking . The gin-palace is the only place of resort . Sir Edmund began his operations with a " show , " and he has been giving shows ever since . That he has succeeded in supplying a want is sufficiently attested by the fact that a million and a half of people attended his entertainments in the first year , 1887-88 . He began in October with a poultry and pigeon show , in his small sheet-iron exhibition shed , and in five days about 37,000 people paid twopence each for admission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animals , and Sir Edmund knew how to please them . In November a several days ' exhibition of chrysanthemums attracted 20,000 people . In December the Prince of Wales visited the place to open an exhibition of the work of London apprentices , which remained open several weeks , and was visited by 86 , ooo people . A three-days ' dog show in March , a two-days ' cat and rabbit show in April , and a two-days ' donkey and pony show in July , were all very largely attended . A workmen 's exhibition , opened in May , had been visited by about ioo , ooo ; and space forbids an account of flower-shows and picture exhibitions and children 's entertainments . All these shows made awards of prizes and premiums , and thus stimulated interest , and excited lively anticipa tions of the next year 's exhibitions and rivalries . The great feature of the recreation section for the year was , however , the closing one , opened by the Duchess of Albany in August , i888 . It was a six-weeks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading modern English artists , concerts by the choral and orchestral societies of the Palace , the constant attendance of a famous military band , flower-shows , and a profusion of bunting everywhere throughout the buildings and grounds , with rifle-galleries , swings , and all sorts of side-shows . ' ' The admission fee was one penny ; and 310,207 people , largely the very poor , entered at the turnstile*s . Meanwhile the beauti*TIibrary with itsbooks and papers was free to everybody , and throughout the year it drew an average of a thousand readers a day on week-days and nearly twice as many on Sundays . In the Queen 's Hall , also , three excellent concerts have been given each week on Monday , Wednesday , and Saturday evenings , with an average attendance of 2500 , the admission fees being only a penny or two . Not the least attractive of these concerts are thQse given by the well- trained choral society and the orchestra of the Palace 's own members . The swimming-bath , opened by the Earl of Rosebery in May , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is self-supporting . Altogether , the recreational section has been a most unequivocal success , and has already proved a boon to East London . The organization of the People 's Palace Institute and its social and educational characteristics are upon the general model of the Regent street Polytechnic . The same limits of age , sixteen to twenty-five , were adopted . The enrollment for the first year reached 4200 , of whom about one-fourth were young women . The membership fees were made rather smaller than those at the Polytechnic , but after a year 's experience they have been raised to precisely the same point . Inits very different environment it seemed necessary for the Palace to make its amusing side more conspicuous than its sober educational side , and as a natural consequence the young people at first joined its Institute more for the entertainments and social diversions than for the classes . With the opening of the second year , in October , i888 , it was found advisable to reverse the original plan , and instead of admitting members to the classes at reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates , young men who had joined one or more classes - thus encouraging study and discouraging the use of the Palace solely as a meeting-place and a center of entertainment . The new rule seems a wise one . While the young men and the young women 1/ // // meet in the reading-room , concert-hall , classes , and various entertainments , their suites of social rooms are entirely separate . The old buildings at the back of the main hall , from which the technical schools have been removed to their new quarters , are fitted up for social purposes . The ground floor is exclusively for the young women , and contains a social room , reading-room , sewing-rooms , the lady superintendent 's room , cloak-rooms , etc . Eleven rooms on the upper floor give accommodation to the young men , and contain a billiard-room , chess-room , club-room , and various others for committees , and the like . The Palace Institute has its full complement of athletic clubs , literary societies , and miscellaneous organizations . The Corporation of the City of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cricket , football , and tennis clubs . Mr. Besant , who takes a lively interest in the Palace , is the leader of a literary circle and editor of the " Palace Journal , " a weekly periodical full of announcements , reports of club meetings , athletic events , and local affairs of the Palace , and with literary features of a character that Mr. Besant 's editorship might well be expected to supply . The social life of the young women comes under the wise and helpful superintendence of a very accomplished lady , Miss Adam , who was Lady Brassey 's friend , and her companion on the famous Surn*eam voyages . The young women have the Queen 's Hall for gymnastics three nights in the week , have their swimming clubs and their nights for exclusive use of the bath , have their dances and evening reunions in the social rooms , and are privileged occasionally to invite their masculine friends to dancing parties . East London being what it is , the association of the two sexes at the Palace on social occasions requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be accomplishing among the young women of the East End that excellent work in the good cause of taste and manners that Mr. Besant 's Miss Kennedy is described in the story as doing . The educational workis particularly indebted to Mr. Mitchell , of the Polytechnic , who organized it for Sir Edmund , and undertook the delicate and important task of selecting a staff of instructors . A list of the evening classes would fill half a page . They cover the same fields of general and commercial instruction , science and art , technical and practical trade , music , and special subjects for young women that I have described in my account of the Polytechnic . The technical and practical classes are admirably conducted by instructors who belong practically to the trades they teach , and have also theoretical knowledge . The relations of these classes to the trades unions and to the examination and subsidy schemes of the Government 's Science and Art Department and the City and Guilds Institute are precisely those of the Polytechnic . In 1887-88 PROPOSED FRONT OF THE PEOPLE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 3716 students joined the classes . Last year the number was much greater , and the facilities , with the new school buildings , were very much improved . Sir Edmund dwells with special enthusiasm upon the advantages and prospects of his technical day school for boys . It is limited to about 5oo . Four hundred were enrolled for the initial year before it had opened.These must be boys who have passed the fifth standard in the public elementary schools , and are over twelve years of age . They are expected to be about thirteen when they enter , and it is desired that they shall stay at least two years , and three if possible . They are picked lads , preferably the sons of mechanics in the neighboring districts . A great number of free scholarships are provided , open to schoolboys on competitive examination . The others pay sixpence a week tuition fee . The lads are given a varied course of general instruction , shop work , and laboratory work . There are great numbers of chemical factories in East London , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will all have thorough instruction in the chemical laboratory . All will begin their mechanical training with woodwork , learning to draw , of course , and doing all their shop work , however simple , from accurate drawings previously made by themselves . They then * advance to other lines of work . These boys are all intended for mechanics , their fathers having given a pledge to that effect , and they are all sons of parents whose income does not exceed $iooo a year . When , at fifteen or sixteen , they leave the school to go into trades , they may join the Palace 's evening classes . A junior order of Institute membership has been established , limited to 250 lads from thirteen to sixteen years of age . This day school embodies the same ideas with respect to the best way to bridge over the gap between the elementary school and the proper age for going to a trade as those held by Mr. Hogg . It evidently suits English conditions . The People 's Palace has as yet found it inexpedient to attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classes , and a voluntary Christian Association exists among the young men . Organ recitals of a high character are given in the great hall on Sundays at hours not conflicting with church services . The Palace enlists the personal aid and interests of many people whose visits are of great benefit . Thus on Saturday nights are to be found at a number of tables in the reading-room gentlemen who give advice and information about books and reading . These tables are labeled , so that the inquiring reader knows at a glance where to apply for judicious help in scientific reading , in poetry , fiction , history , biography , economics , etc . The idea is a very admirable one , and might be applied in all great public libraries with wonderful advantage . Mr. Longman , the publisher , is a member of the library committee , and gentlemen of the highest special qualifications are glad to give their services . Musicians of eminence take the solo parts in the concerts , literary men and famous scientists give lectures , and this East End university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best talent of England . Sir Edmund has many ideas and plans yet to be put into execution ; but the place is fairly established upon main lines that will not MACHINE SHOP , C.YIIINASiUIVI , AP* PEOPLE 'S PALACE . // be abandoned . The establishment as soon to be completed will represent an investment , chiefly in bricks and mortar , of about $6oo , ooo . Sir Edmund 's three concerts a week and his numerous popular shows bring in pennies by the scores and hundreds of thousands , and these help to meet the current expenses . The Drapers ' yearly la*g*ss covers a good part of the deficit , and the rest is to be permanently met by an endowment which I shall mention further on . It is not to be inferred that in all the years of the past no other attempts more or less directly in this line had been made by good people for the benefit of the two million human beings of East London . A number of establishments still survive to tell the tale of brave efforts ; but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have rested upon so broad a foundation as the Polytechnic plan . It is one of Sir Edmund 's generous ambitions to make the People 's Palace the head and center of a coflperating group of East End institutions , which are not necessarily to be upon the same exact model , but which unite recreative and educational features for the we'lfare of the young . He believes that life and vigor can be infused into more than one enterprise now languishing under debt or bad management or paucity of resources . The Rev. Freeman Wills is a gentleman whose share in the Polytechnic movement should have due and honorable mention . For several years , with voice and pen , he has been preaching the gospel of institutions upon Mr. Hogg 's plan , and urging their establishment in different parts of London . Shortly before the opening of the People 's Palace he had himself established a polytechnic known as the . " Finsbury , " near the eastern edge of " the City " and close to the well-known Broad Street Station . It is not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed for funds ; but it has several thousand boys on its membership rolls and in its classes , and it manages to survive and do good work . It has influential friends who have made it very considerable gifts , and its large membership seems so strong an argument for its permanent maintenance that it is not likely that it will be allowed to close its doors for lack of funds . Its clubs and societies are in a very lively condition , and while its educational equipment is not equal to that of the two great institutions I have just described , it happens to be in the vicinity of excellent technical and night schools , and its especial function would seem to be the social , moral , physical , and recreative culture of the thousands of young men who live within easy reach of its doors . Mr. Wills had known much of the condition of South London , and of its great and crying need for institutions of just this character ; and in the spring of i888 he obtained on favorable terms the lease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $140,000 in a populous part of South London as a public hall , swimming-bath , and place of resort . It had been a financial failure , and Mr. Wills secured it as a building which could easily be adapted for the uses of a polytechnic . It was opened in June by the Princess Louise , and within three months it had secured a membership of three thousand boys . Its future depends chiefly upon its success in securing , first , the funds that will be required to purchase the building and make the necessary additions , and then the public endowment for which it is a hopeful candidate . It is under the personal management of Mr. Wills , who conducts the weekly " Polytechnic Journal " as the organ of his two institutions . An influential committee acts as a provisional board of trustees . The surrounding districts , which include Kensington , Brixton , Clapham , Camherwell , and parts of other parishes , have a population of 250,000 within a radius of less than one and a half miles from the " Lambeth Polytechnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of the poorest orders . I have spoken of a " public endowment " for which at the time this sketch was written the Lambeth Polytechnic was a candidate ; and this brings me to a part of my subject which is , perhaps , the most important of all . The Charity Commissioners are a board which was created by Parliament in 1853 to superintend the administration of charitable and educational endowments all over Great Britain . In 1883 Professor James Bryce carried through Parliament a bill providing for the amalgamation of the old parochial charities of London find the application of the income to the welfare of the poorer classes throughout the metropolis , under direction of the Charity Commissioners , in the form of provisions for technical education , the maintenance of libraries or museums , the purchase of open spaces and recreation grounds , the establishment or assistaiice of provident institutions and hospitals , and whatever else might seem good to the commissioners in promotion of " the physical , social , and moral condition of the poorer inhabitants . " In about a hundred old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient standing whose original objects had become obsolete , or whose funds , having greatly outgrown the requirements of those objects , were being squandered or misapplied . Under the terms of this act the Charity Commissioners garnered funds and property to the total value of about $15 , ooo , ooo , yielding ( at three per cent. ) a present income of $500 , ooo , // about $200,000 of which is paid over to another body , the Ecclesiastical Commissioners , for Established Church purposes , while the remainder is at the disposal of the charity board for the objects specified in the act . Considerable sums have been devoted to the purchase of parks ; and , in accordance with the evident wish of Parliament and the general public , it was determined by the commissioners to aid technical education . Very thorough investigation was made by the board with the view to discover the best way to promote a technical instruction that would benefit the lower rather than the middle classes . Institutions at home and abroad were studied , Mr. Henry Cunynghame , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole subject . As a result , the commissioners concluded that in England only the richer and middle classes would go to day technical schools , and that night schools for apprentices and young people of the working classes should be supported . They also concluded that in England it would be wholly unwise and impracticable to attempt to make the technical school supplant the shop , and that its instruction should be supplementary and of a more scientific and theoretical character , rather than for the purpose of imparting mere working skill in trades . They were convinced that for the young workingmen of the metropolis it was highly desirable that the gymnasium , the swimming-bath , athletic games , and careful physical training should be provided . They also concluded that it would be fatal to mix ages , and that the period from sixteen to twenty-five was the approved one . Further , they agreed that it would not be well to give apprentice boys " things for nothing . " And thus they had reasoned themselves into the acceptance of Mr. Hogg 's polytechnic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poorer classes of London . They determined to take his school as a model , and to promote the establishment of a series of similar institutes throughout the metropolis . Studying Mr. Hogg 's experience , they were satisfied that $*oo , ooo could be made to pay the cost of plain buildings and to provide an endowment fund that would yield enough to cover at least a good part of the difference between current receipts and expenditures for an institute that would accommodate say four thousand members and a larger number of students . It became known in the spring of i888 that the commissioners would aid in the establishment of a number of these institutes , upon approval of their locations and plans , and upon the securing of at least half the necessary means from private donors . It was understood that $3,000,000 , or the income of that amount , would be devoted by the commissioners to the promotion of polytechnics . They gave Mr. Hogg 's polytechnic $12,500 a year in perpetuity , on condition that a private fund of $175,000 be raised-this being regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been met , the Polytechnic has now an assured income from endowments of $20,000 a year , which places it upon a secure footing . The People 's Palace also receives from the commissioners this same sum of $12 ,  - -  5oo per year . The commissioners further offered in the early summer of i888 to give outright $750,000 towards the maintenance of three polytechnics on the south side of the Thames on condition that an equal sum should be contributed from other sources . The offer created great enthusiasm , and a highly influential committee was formed to carry the project through . It was in anticipation of the acceptance of his institution as one of the three that Mr. Wills opened his Lambeth polytechnic . Large gifts to the South London committee from wealthy city guilds have assured the success of the project . South London has from 8oo , ooo to 1,000,000 people , and many of its districts are almost as dreary and destitute as the East End itself . The easternmost of these South London pQlytechnics has been secured for New SUNOAY CONCEET IN THE GREAT HALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S PALACE . // Cross in Deptford . This parish is bounded by Greenwich , Lewisham , Peckham , and Rotherhithe , and the region has a quarter of a million people . The buildings and grounds of the Royal Naval School have been acquired for this polytechnic through the generosity of the Goldsmiths ' Company , which in October announced its willingness to give an endowment of $12,500 a year , this income being regarded as equivalent to a capital sum of more than $400,000 . The Charity Commissioners promptly met the gift with one of like amount and secured the premises . This polytechnic will be known as the Goldsmiths ' Company 's Institute , and that company will doubtless guard its future prosperity . It will , of course , be conducted upon the Regent street model . The central polytechnic of the South London group will be at the Borough Road , on premises long owned by the Corporation of London , and as an annex it will have the great Royal Victoria Hall , purchased inAugust , i888 , bya committee , of which the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People 's Palace " as a tribute to the memory of the late S*amuel Morley . For the vast population in the vicinity of the " Elephant and Castle " and Spurgeon 's Tabernacle , this Borough Road Institute and People 's Palace will be of inestimable benefit . It has the most promising situation , perhaps , that could be secured in the entire metropolis , excepting that of the People 's Palace for East London . Whether Mr. Wills 's Lambeth polytechnic will eventually be accepted by the South London committee as their third undertaking seems as yet to be uncertain , a rival site being the Albert Palace , at Battersea Park , which has , of late been idle in the hands of a receiver , and which with its grounds could be readily transformed into a most suitable and attractive people 's palace and polytechnic institute . Southwest London , on the north side of the Thames , was made practically certain of a polytechnic institute when early in the summer of r888 the Charity Commissioners offered $250,000 on condition of an equal sum being subscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by Earl Cadogan , valued at $50,000 . Although surrounded by the wealthiest parishes of London , from Fulham to Westminster , this region has its hundreds of thousands of poor people who will profit by the instittite . The arrangements for North London have not progressed so far , at the time this is written , as those for South London ; but the commissioners have signified their willingness to give $i , ooo , ooo for the endowment of four polytechnics in North London , on condition X*oL . XL. - 25-26. that a like sum be secured by voluntary subscriptions for the erection and equipment of the buildings upon plans approved by the commissioners . Committees composed of members of Parliament and influential citizens of the boroughs of Hackney , Finsbury , Islington , and St. Pancras are earnestly working for the attainment of these very desirable institutions . Of the five million inhabitants of the metropolis , North London may certainly claim more than a million , and the need for people 's palaces is only less urgent than in the east and the south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see from nine to twelve of these admirable institutions in the different parts of the metropolis , all well housed , all endowed , and able altogether to provide instruction and amusement for well-nigh a hundred thousand young people of the average age of twenty . They will all have excellent technical , commercial , and general schools for evening students , and technical day schools for lads in the early teens . Each will have an ample gymnasium , a swimming-bath , a recreation ground somewhere accessible , and cricket , foot-ball , rowing , tennis , cycling , and other out-of-door clubs . They will all have social rooms , reading-rooms , literary societies , and indoor clubs of every legitinc*ate description . In addition to provisions for their own members , most of them will provide entertainment and instruction in popular form for the masses , the extent of this part of the work depending much upon the locality and its needs . Certainly this is a very remarkable and a very promising movement . If it stood alone it would be almost lost in the vastness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as an harmonious part of the whole work of popular education that is making its advances tardily but surely in England . The night classes maintained throughout London by the School Board , assisted on the recreative side by the Recreative Evening Classes Association , accomplish no small good . The university extension movement , with its popular lectures , has become an appreciable educational influence ; and Toynbee Hall , which has grown out of the university movement , is an increasing factor in the work of social and educational improvement among the poor . The famous schools of an older order , of which King 's College , the Birkbeck Scientific and Literary Institution , and the Workingmen 's College are instances , still flourish and give instruction to many thousands of people in day and evening classes . The Finsbury Technical College , the City and Guilds ' Central Institution at South Kensington , and the great science and art colleges of the Government adjoining the Kensington Museum , are all at- // tamable by the exceptional young person who aspires to the highest scientific , artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other successful schools of a more or less special character , have their places and perform admirably their proper functions . But the Polytechnic supplies a want so distinct as to be unmistakable . It gives the sons of the people a few years of experience in association together for studies and pastimes and the varied interests and pleasures of youth , that is akin to the experiences that the more favored sons of the wealthy enjoy at Eton , Rugby , Harrow , and the other great public schools , and at the universities . It is a kind of experience that develops manhood , and that may do much to preserve and bring to the front those best traits of English character which the life in crowded towns in too many ways tends to minimize if not to destroy . However successful the polytechnic movement might prove in other and smaller cities ,  --  and it certainly would seem to have a wide applicability ,  - -  there can be no manner of doubt about its fitness for London conditions and about its brilliant and useful future .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
