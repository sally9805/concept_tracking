The Board of Estimate and Apportionment has included the necessary amount in the city budget for this year , to be raised by taxation , and that is the best way to provide for the requirement . It is a little hard to have to pay three years ' taxes for this purpose in one year , but they are taxes which should have been extended over the three years . What is yet to be paid on account of the past is only what should have been paid from the proceeds of taxation when it was due . If payment is required before this year 's taxes are collected the authority exists of issuing bonds in anticipation of the collection of revenue for this as for other municipal payments .
