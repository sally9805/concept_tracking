THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION . DURING the past twenty-five years there have been centennial celebrations of many battles , and of other events connected with the foundation of the republic ; but none has greater significance for us as a nation capable of defending our rights and of resisting pressure from without , than the centenary of the launching of the Constitution in Boston on October 21 , 1797 . She marks the beginning of our navy . Two other ships were launched a few days earlier than she , but neither has won such a place in our affections or in our history . Up to 1798 , the navy , which had no ships , was supposed to be a branch of the War Department , and on May 21 of that year the first Secretary of the Navy was appointed , in accordance with a recent law of Congress establishing a separate department . As the Constitution went into commission about that time , the naval service may be said to have come into existence with her . Her exploits have been the chief addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our foreign relations became more and more unsatisfactory , and some of our ablest statesmen were abroad , unsuccessfully endeavoring to make treaties acceptable to the nation 's self-respect . We were paying tribute in the shape of men to England , of ships and their cargoes to France , and of money to the Barbary powers . While France and England were at war , each strove to outdo the other in its restrictions upon our commerce . The system of impressment begun by England could not be endured by an independent nation , but France would have followed even in that imposition , had it not been impossible to prove an American sailor to be a Frenchman . As it was , her minister to the United States attempted to ride roughshod over our laws , and our ministers to France were insulted and browbeaten . The treatment accorded to one of our ships which grounded on the French coast , and was stripped of her cargo by direction of the government , was enough to make us forget the friendship of France during the Revolutionary War . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . The child of our country in its weakness and poverty , she has survived to a destiny unrivaled in all the annals of naval warfare . She has accomplished without a single failure every task assigned to her , and in a long life has never brought discredit to an officer or a man serving on board of her . Most of our great commanders in the first half of the century began or found their careers upon her decks . Preble , Rodgers , Hull , Decatur , Bainbridge , and Stewart in turn commanded her during the first twenty years of her existence . It was a happy coincidence that she received the name of the great bulwark of our republic . The frigate was authorized by act of Congress on March 27 , 1794 , together with five other frigates , to be used against the Barbary States in the protection of our merchant shipping , and in the deliverance of American captives held for ransom ; but in consequence of a treaty purchased by the payment of tribute to the dey of Algiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of the subject , Congress directed the completion of the three most advanced , one of them being the Constitution . By this delay the timbers were allowed two years for seasoning , and became so hard as to earn for her , fifteen years later , the name " Old Ironsides . " Her completion was hurried forward by the expected war with France . The two main arguments for the new navy were , therefore , the suppression of piracy and // the maintenance of our rights as neutrals . The impressment of seamen on the high seas did not become a burning question until later . The design and model of the Constitution were made by Joshua Humphreys , of Philadelphia , and sent to Boston for use in the construction of the ship . The materials were carefully selected wherever they could be found , and all the best features of the English and French ships were adopted , without regard to expense . Her builder , Colonel George Claghorn , kept her fully three years in the shipyard near what is now Constitution Wharf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final equipment . It is interesting to note that Paul Revere supplied all the copper fastenings . The first day set for the launch was September 20 , and the President , John Adams , and the governor of the State were present to see her off ; but the settling of the ways under the moving load checked her twenty-seven feet from the start . It was not deemed prudent to use rams or tackles on her , and the builder spent one month shoring up the ways . She finally slid into the water on October 21 , 1797 . The United States had been launched on July 10 of the same year , at Philadelphia , and the Constellation on September 7 , at Baltimore . Admiral Preble in his History of the Flag says , however , that " the Constitution was the first of the new frigates to carry the fifteen stars and fifteen stripes upon the deep blue sea . " This flag was hoisted just before the launch by a workman named Samuel Bentley . Captain Nicholson , the inspecting officer , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistance of a man named Harris , took advantage of his absence at breakfast to work off an old grudge by quietly running up the flag . The ship cost , ready for sea , about three hundred thousand dollars . She was one hundred and seventy-five feet long , forty-three and a half feet in beam , and fourteen and a half feet deep , with a tonnage of 1576 by measurement . Her power and classification were distinctly below those of a line-of-battle ship , but she had greater speed under sail , and was thus better fitted to escape from a too powerful antagonist . In relation to modern navies , the armored cruiser New York probably comes nearest to a similar position among the ships of her time . She had less than one half the length of the New York , only two thirds the beam , and about three fourths the draught , - making her not far from one of our gunboats in size . It is said that many of her first guns were purchased in England . She was called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , though the batteries actually consisted of thirty long 24-pounders on the main deck , and twenty-two 32-pound carronades on the spardeck . Two 24-pounders were at times carried on the forecastle as bow-chasers . These guns were heavier than those usually carried on frigates of her own class in foreign navies , and she had only one gun-deck instead of two . In connection with the interminable controversy which subsequently arose over the superiority of the Constitution and her class to the English frigates captured during the war of 1812 , it is well to remember that Mr. Humphreys intended his three larger frigates to be a little better in every respect than English or French ships of the same rating . He aimed at advantages similar to those we are now seeking in our new battle-ships and cruisers : better guns , greater speed , and greater cruising capacity . His reasons , stated in a letter to Robert Morris , still apply . He says : " The situation of our coast and depth of water in our harbors are different in some degree from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable time inferior in the number of vessels to theirs , we are to consider what size ships will be most formidable , and be an overmatch 591 // for those of an enemy . If we build our ships of the same size as the Europeans , they having so great a number of them , we shall always be behind them . I would build them of a larger size than theirs , and take the lead of them , which is the only safe method of commencing a navy. ** Herein lies the secret of our success . It belongs as much to our fame as does the splendid discipline of our men . The humane principle in war is never to fight on equal terms ; otherwise two armies or two ships will be exterminated instead of one . There are always causes behind the results in war , and valuable lessons to be learned . The Constitution received only the reward given to those who have the foresight to provide a better ship , better guns , and a better crew than their opponents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight with the Guerriere she fired a broadside weighing 684 against the Guerriere 's 556 pounds . Two guns were removed before the engagement with the Java , and her broadside was 654 against 576 pounds . Her crew was larger in both instances . The first duty of the Constitution , as was anticipated , proved to be in the war of reprisal against the French , whose depredations on our commerce had become unendurable . Overrating their influence in America , they had begun by seizing English ships in our waters , and had ended by capturing our own ships as well , - so determined were they to force us into an alliance . Our government had no alternative but a return in kind , and in August , 1798 , Captain Nicholson , sailed from Newport with the Constitution and four revenue cutters for a cruise along the coast south of Cape Henry , to pick up French cruisers , privateers , and merchantmen . Towards the end of the year she was assigned to a squadron in the West Indies , where she remained until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the time as Captam Talbot 's flag-ship . Her career during this period does not present much that is exciting , as she captured only a few insignificant prizes . The Constellation had the fortune to be the only frigate which saw really serious service against ships of her own class . Two events , however , were full of promise for the future . The first was a friendly race with an English frigate . The two ships happened to meet at sea not far from San Domingo , and the English captain went on board the Constitution to see Captain Talbot . He looked over the ship and expressed great admiration for her , but declared that his own ship could outsail her on the wind . As he had come out by way of the Madeiras , he offered to bet a cask of wine against an equivalent in money on the result , if Captain Talbot would meet him thereabouts some weeks later . He was going into port to clean bottom and refit . The agreement was made . When the Englishman came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and arranged all the conditions of the next day 's race . They kept near each other during the night , and at dawn made sail upon the firing of a gun . All day long the race continued in short tacks to windward . Isaac Hull sailed the American frigate , watching for every possible opportunity and advantage . His skill in handling the ship under sail gained him a lasting reputation . The men were kept on deck all day , moving from side to side to bring the ship to an even keel on the different tacks . As Cooper says , " the manner in which the Constitution eat her competitor out of the wind was not the least striking feature of the trial . " When the gun was fired at sunset , the Englishman was hull down to leeward . The Constitution , accordingly , squared away before the wind , and joined him just after dark . A boat was waiting , and the English captain came on board like a true sportsman , with his cask of // Madeira . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a social glass of wine in celebration of the event ; especially since English ships did not at all mind impressing an occasional American as a recruit . The next and not very creditable exploit of the Constitution was unfortunate in its ultimate effects . In May , 1800 , a party of sailors and marines , under the leadership of Hull , was sent into a Spanish port to cut out a French letter of marque , Sandwich . The party numbered about ninety , all of whom , with the exception of six or seven , were hidden in the hold of the sloop Sally , armed for the purpose by the Constitution . They ran alongside the Sandwich in broad daylight , and in two minutes had captured her . The marines were sent on shore to spike the guns of the Spanish fort , while sails were bent and she was made ready to leave the harbor . Although this part of the undertaking consumedseveral hours , she escaped without the loss of a single man . No expedition was ever better planned and carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for they lost all their prize-money in paying damages for the illegal capture in a neutral port ; besides , the Sandwich was returned to her original owners . From March , 1801 , to May , 1803 , the Constitution lay at Boston , dismantled , but in September of the latter year we find her in Gibraltar , on the way to Tripoli , as Commodore Preble 's flag-ship . The war with Tripoli would make a long story , and since it was principally carried on with the smaller ships , only an outline will be given here ; but the courage and daring of the American sailors stand out in two or three incidents which can not be passed over in silence . The details of every expedition were planned on the Constitution , and the young commanding officers who came over her side to see Preble ( " boys " he called them ) must have gathered courage and inspira tion from the great commander . The flag-ship was too large for effective service against fortifications protected by shoals and uncertain winds , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procured in Messina from the Sicilian government . From time to time Tripolitan ketches were captured , and fitted out to aid in the service . Just before Preble 's arrival off Tripoli , while in chase of a small vessel at the mouth of the harbor , the Philadelphia had run on the rocks ; and as she could not be got off , Captain Bainbridge and his whole crew surrendered . They were prisoners in the castle during the two years of the war , and were in as much danger from their countrymen 's guns as was the Turk . The Philadelphia had been floated off and brought into the harbor , where she was being fitted up . All the guns were in place and ready for use , when Captain Bainbridge managed in some way to communicate with Preble , giving information about her , and suggesting that she be destroyed , as she was undoubtedly intended for service against her old flag . The subject was broached to Lieutenant Stephen Decatur , who at once volunteered to go in with his own ship , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so far modified by Commodore Preble as to substitute for the Enterprise , in this hazardous service , a Tripolitan ketch that Decatur had captured a few days before . The ketch , rechristened the Intrepid , and fitted out specially for the undertaking , was manned by volunteers from Decatur 's ship , with some additions from the Constitution . In this wretched boat , rigged for sixteen oars , and hardly larger than a fair-sized sailing yacht , seventy-four men left the fleet , accompanied by the brig Siren under Lieutenant Commandant Stewart , and headed for a passage through the rocks to the inner harbor . She arrived in sight of the town in the afternoon , and anchored off the entrance // at nightfall ; but a sudden and violent gale swept her to the eastward , and both she and the Siren had to ride out at sea the terrific storm that lasted six days and nights . At times it was feared that the Intrepid could not last through it ; but the seventh day found both vessels near the harbor , once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not approach within sight of the coast during daylight , but the Intrepid sailed calmly for the port as if on an ordinary trading voyage . Decatur had made all his arrangements to burn the Philadelphia , and then to escape by towing or rowing the Intrepid out of the harbor under cover of the darkness . Every man had his allotted station and task , and as soon as the frigate was taken each was to rush with combustibles to a specified place . The greater part of the crew lay hidden behind the bulwarks , as the ketch drifted slowly down in the halfdarkness of a new moon to the anchorage . It is well to stop a moment to consider what one mistake would have cost them . The Philadelphia had a full crew , all her guns were loaded , and she was surrounded by Tripolitan gunboats . Not one of the Americans could have escaped if the slightest suspicion had been aroused before boarding ; yet they went boldly on to within a few feet of the Philadelphia , and saying that the ketch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , they asked for a line , and begged permission to tie up astern overnight . She lay only forty yards from the port battery , and in the range of every gun . While Decatur coolly sent a boat to make fast to the forechains of the Philadelphia , some of the latter 's crew came out with a line from the stern , and assisted them in making fast there also . A few minutes of cautious pulling on the bow-line , then a wild cry of " Amencanos ! " from the Turks who were looking over the bulwarks , and the Americans were springing up the side in a scramble to see who could be first on the frigate 's deck . In a mad panic the crew were either cut down or driven into the sea . Everything worked exactly as Decatur had planned it , and within twenty minutes the ship was ablaze . His men were fairly driven back into their boat by the flames . The return was even more perilous than the entrance , as all the forts and gunboats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intrepid and dashing the spray into the faces of her men , as she swept down the harbor under sixteen long oars . The flames of the Philadelphia , with the roaring of her guns as they went off one by one in the intense heat , the blinding flashes of the Turkish guns , and the uproar in the town made the night one never to be forgotten ; a fit ending to what Nelson pronounced " the most bold and daring act of the age . " Decatur rejoined Stewart , who was waiting for him outside , and the two set sail for Syracuse . Nine months later , the little Intrepid left a lasting and melancholy memory in our service by her mysterious and fatal ending . She wasefitted as a floating mine , to be carried into the midst of the dey 's flotilla , and then blown up . One hundred barrels of powder and one hundred and fifty shells were placed in her , with a train leading to a convenient spot near the stern . Captain Richard Somers and Lieutenant Henry Wadsworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two small boats in tow for the escape after lighting the fuse . As it was part of their plan not to permit themselves or the ship to be taken by the enemy , who were greatly in need of powder , Somers 's idea is said to have been to blow her up in case they were boarded before reaching the proposed position . The night was very dark when they put out from the Nautilus and disappeared within the harbor . Three gunboats were hanging about the entrance at the time . To those waiting to pick // intense , although it lasted only a few minutes . The Turks had taken alarm at something , and were firing in every direction . Suddenly the Intrepid 's mast and sail were seen to lift within a sheet of flame , and a frightful concussion shook even the ships of the American fleet outside . The crew of the Nautilus waited in vain for the return of their comrades , but none of them came back . So far as was ever known the Intrepid did no damage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day . Amid such scenes as these , varied with hand-to-hand conflicts in the harbor , the Constitution passed two years . In one attack , Decatur fought single - handed with a giant Turk , whom he finally killed by reaching around his body and firing a shot into his back . The ball passed through him , and lodged in Decatur 's clothing . It was during this struggle that Decatur 's life was saved by a young sailor , who lost his arm by interposing it between his captain and the sword of an assailant . No story has been oftener told to American children . The incessant activity of Preble seems remarkable when we consider the character of the service , so far from home , and at all times distant from the bas&amp; of supplies . He traveled thousands of miles in his voyages between Syracuse and Tripoli , with an occasional visit to Tunis for the purpose of overawing the hey , who was not to be trusted . The Constitution bombarded the fortifications three times , and on one occasion , while supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silenced all the Tripolitan guns . The dey was finally forced into signing a treaty of peace , giving American ships entire freedom of commerce in the Mediterranean ; but Preble did not stay to see the end . He was relieved of his command by Commodore Barron , who , on account of sickness , was soon succeeded by Captain Rodgers . The treaty was drawn up in the cabin of the Con-595 stitution , under Rodgers 's directions . By a demonstration of the whole fleet before Tunis , the bey likewise was frightened into making a treaty . The importance of this war was twofold : it gave our merchant - ships comparative safety in the Mediterranean , and it formed the nursery in which our naval officers were trained for the more difficult tasks before them . Nearly all the great names of the next war appear in connection with Tripoli . Whatever may be said of England 's greatness on the sea at this time , it was Anierica , the new nation of the West , which freed Christendom of its scourge in North Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1807 , and was kept on the home coast until the summer of 1811 , in expectation of trouble with England . She made a voyage to Cherbourg , however , to carry over the United States envoy to France , and returned to Washington in the spring of 1812 , after having touched at ports in Holland and England . The crew was discharged , and the ship placed for overhauling in the hands of INathaniel Haraden , her old sailing-master under Preble . Her captain complained that she had fallen off in sailing qualities , and requested that she be hove out for repairing the copper . Mr. Haraden , who knew her thoroughly , at anchor and at sea , not only patched up the copper , but also completely restowed her ballast , leaving about one third of it on shore . The result was magical , and no doubt contributed to her escape from an entire squadron soon after . She dropped down the Potomac in June , with only half her crew and several of the old officers , and , when news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . On July 5 she sailed with a green crew , seine of whom had never been to sea , and many of whom had not even been stationed at the guns and sails . Captain Hull 's marvelous power of The Frigate Constitution . // organization is exhibited in the adventure which befell him twelve days later . We may call this the first of the great international races outside of New York harbor , with the Constitution as prize . It has become memorable in the navy for the use of the kedge-anchor in the shallow water off the Jersey coast . To this day , if one asks an American tar bow Hull escaped from the British in 1812 , he will reply , " He kedged . " At two o'clock on the afternoon of July 17 , when about forty miles east of Cape May , heading for New York , four sails were discovered to the north . Hull immediately tacked to the northeast , and the squadron , which consisted of the Shannon , the Belvidera , the Africa , and the A*olus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase . At four o'clock a fifth sail was made out to windward , bearing northeast in a favorable position to close with the Constitution . This ship was the Guerriere . Fortunately the wind shifted at sunset , which placed the Constitution to windward ; but for forty-eight hours there was either a calm or hardly more than enough wind to give steerageway . Hull employed every expedient known to the seaman to get away , except that of throwing his provisions , guns , and boats overboard . He lost nothing but two thousand gallons of water pumped out to lighten the hull . During the calm , both the English and the Americans resorted to towing by means of boats ; but as the former had five frigates to draw upon for men , it was only a question of time how the struggle would end . One of the ships drew up uncomfortably close , when Hull and his first lieutenant suddenly conceived the idea of fastening all their spare ropes and cables together and paying them out to an anchor carried half a mile ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Englishman , who never afterwards got near enough to throw a shot into the Constitution . The sails were trimmed to take advantage of every catspaw of wind . The men were shifted from one side of the deck to the other , to favor her sailing , and not a man slept in his bunk for nearly three days . All guns were loaded , ready for action , several having been placed to give a fire directly astern . The Shannon , the Belvidera , and the Guerriere opened fire at long range , as fortune of wind and sea brought one or the other within firing distance , but no shot took effect . At one time , during a puff of wind , Captain Hull expected to be overtaken by the Belvidera , so close had she come on the quarter , and lie prepared to cripple her , if possible , before her consovts could come up ; but it was not to be . The chase really ended on the evening of the third day , when a heavy rainsquall came up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men in readiness , let everything go by the run at the instant it struck . As soon as his ship was obscured by the rain , he quickly shortened sail , and went off on the starboard tack at eleven knots . The English , some miles to leeward , deceived by the apparent confusion on the American ship , let go their sails before the wind struck them , and went off more to leeward on different tacks . One hour later , when the squall had passed , the Constitution was hull down , and too far away for any possibility of capture . The chase was abandoned next morning , when daylight found the American almost out of sight . Nothing in the annals of our navy has ever exhibited more perfect seamanship , ready resource , and constant cheerfulness than this chase , in which our ship was pitted against a whole fleet under some of the best English captains . Her next cruise was the shortest and most fateful in her long life of one hundred years , and the whole country was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraged over the outlook on hand . The war with England was unpopular , and nowhere // more so than in New England , the chief sufferer from the embargo . Yankee ports were filled with Yankee ships complaining bitterly that their trade had 1*een destroyed . Incompetence reigned in the army , and the campaign against Canada had proved a miserable failure . Yet here was a ship going out alone to battle with the greatest navy of the world , at a time when England had reached the very summit of her power on the sea . A large squadron was off the coast , as Hull well knew . It had been thought advisable in Washington to have all naval vessels safely anchored in port and dismantled , in order to prevent the English blockading fleet from getting them . Fortunately , Captains Bainbridge and Stewart , both of whom afterwards commanded the Constitution in successful actions against the British , were able to dissuade the department from this foolish step . Orders were sent , however , to keep the Constitution in Boston ; but Hull had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controversy . It is said he feared that the blockade might shut him in , or that he might be relieved by Captain Bainbridge , his senior in command ; at any rate , he got away on August 2 , 1812 , just before the orders reached Boston . He stood to eastward around Nova Scotia to the mouth of the St. Lawrence River , and then to the south and east , but made no important capture . On the morning of the 18th Captain Hull learned from a Salem privateer that a large British frigate had been sighted the day before to the south . The Constitution was accordingly headed in that direction , and at two o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th a strange sail was made out to the east by south , - too far away , however , for any clear indication of her character and nationality . The Constitution was at this time about seven hundred miles due east of Boston , with ample room for the interview which Captain Dacres of the Guerriere - as the ship turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so eager as to indorse on the register of the ship John Adams , from Liverpod , a letter to the commander of the American squadron , expressing a wish to meet a United States frigate of the same force as the President outside of Sandy Hook " for a t*te-h-t*te . " In Isaac Hull , the man who would rather fight than eat , he found everything that was lively and hearty . Many generations of American boys have gloried over the fight between the Constitution and the Guerriere , and Cooper has drawn a vivid picture of the scene . Hull ran down before the wind to take a look at the stranger , and found him with his main topsail aback , waiting for the Constitution to come up . Both ships cleared for action , and when the Constitution was still far astern the Guerriere began firing at long range . Only two or three shots were fired in return , and then the American bore down upon the Englishman in silence . Nothing shows more forcibly the perfect discipline of the ship than this hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades falling around them . Even Mr. Morris , the first lieutenant , found it hard to restrain his impatience , and he asked to be allowed to fire . Not till the ships were fairly abreast and within pistol-shot of each other was the word finally given . The effect was almost instantaneous as a whole broadside struck the Guerriere , followed quickly by a second staggering blow . Her mizzenmast went overboard , and the Constitution was able to pass around the Guerriere 's bow , where she delivered a raking fire which cut away the foremast and much of the rigging . In wearing to return across her bow , the Guerriere s starboard bow fouled the port quarter of the Constitution . It was while in this position that both sides tried to board , and Lieutenant Bush of the marine corps was killed , and Lieutenant Morris was dangerously wounded . Two guns // in the bow of the Guerriere were fired point-blank into the cabin of the Constitution and set fire to the ship . The danger was grave , l ) ut the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the fire . As the ships separated , the Guerriere 's foremast and mainmast went by the board , leaving her a helpless hulk in the trough of the sea . Captain Dacres 's interview was over , having lasted , from the first broadside of the Constitution , just thirty minutes . He was wounded , seventy-nine of his men out of a crew of two hundred and seventy-two were killed and wounded , and not a stick was left standing on his deck . There was no need to haul down the flag ; it was gone with the rigging , and Captain Dacres surrendered perforce . The Constitution had lost fourteen men and had sustained comparatively small injury . Within a few hours she was ready for another fight . The Guerriere was so cut to pieces that she could not be taken into port , and Hull burned her . The last act , after removing the prisoners and wounded , gives one a glimpse of the Christianity and chivalry of these two captains who spoke the same tongue and in whose veins flowed the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything he would like to save from his ship . He said yes , his mother 's Bible , which he had carried with him for years . An officer was sent to get it . Thus began a friendship between these enemies which lasted till Hull 's death in 1843 . Many stories are told of this fight , which was one of the most dramatic in history , both in its action and in its immediate effects upon the country . In the Guerriere 's crew there were ten Americans , who , to the honor and credit of the English , were sent below . One of them , a merchant-ship captain , was standing near Captain Dacres while the Constitution was approaching . The Guerriere was pouring out shot after shot , and broadside after broadside , as the other came like death upon an unsuspecting victim . The silence was appalling , and Captain . Dacres asked the American what it could mean . " Do you think she will strike without firing a shot ? " As the story goes , the American answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , I will join the doctor in the cockpit , where I can be of use in taking care of the wounded . " The English captain 's reply , " Go , if you wish , but there are not likely to be many wounded , " found speedy contradiction . Within a few minutes after the American reached the cockpit , and while he was waiting in agonizing suspense , a terrific roar sounded above the English guns , and the Guerriere staggered under blow after blow . In a few minutes all was silence , and the American , passing a line of wounded , stuck his head up through the hatch to find the Guerriere a hopeless wreck . Tradition has it that in this fight the Constitution obtained her sobriquet " Old Ironsides . " When struck by a shot from the Guerriere , the outside planking did not yield , and the shot fell into the sea . One of the seamen shouted , " Huzza ! her sides are made of iron ! " It is also said that Hull , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first order to fire , and split his breeches from keel to truck . Upon Captain Hull 's arrival in Boston , the news of his victory was received with exultation . It had followed close upon the surrender of Detroit , and was like a bright gleam in the darkness . Our people could now feel that the navy , though small , was not impotent against the greatest sea power of the world , and , ship for ship , we had nothing to fear . Standing by itself , the destruction of the Guerriere amounted to nothing . It was the moral effect which gave it great and lasting importance . The surprise and gloom produced in England by the disaster were equaled only by the inability to explain it . In one English newspa // per we find this conclusion : " From it the inference may be drawn that a contest with the Americans is more worthy of our arms than was at first sight imagined . " The London Times said : " It is not merely that an English frigate has been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a brave resistance , but that it has been taken by a new enemy , - an enemy unaccustomed to such triumphs , and likely to be rendered confident by them . He must be a weak politician who does not see how important the first triumph is in giving a tone and character to the war . " A dinner , in which men of all political parties united , was given to Hull and his officers at Faneull Hall on September 5 . They marched in procession with a great number of prominent citizens up State Street , in the middle of the afternoon , and sat down to what the Palladium called an " excellent dinner , " which must have been interminable , for seventeen toasts were drunk . From these the following are selected as an evidence of the effect of the victory upon " all political parties : " The American Nation May danger from abroad insure union at home . " " Our Infant Navy - We must nurture the young Hercules in his cradle , if we mean to profit by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celebrate - An invaluable proof that we are able to defend our rights on the ocean . " " No Entangling Alliance - We have suffered the injuries and insults of despotism with patience , but its friendship is more than we can bear . " The next action in which Old Ironsides engaged followed in less than five months , with a ship practically her equal . The command had been turned over to Captain Bainbridge , who sailed , in company with the Hornet , for the West Indies on October 26 . At San Salvador they fell in with an English ship , which they challenged to come out and fight the Hornet . She agreed at first , but delayed so long that Captain Bainbridge finally left the Hornet waiting outside of the harbor , and sailed to the southeast along the coast of Brazil . On December 29 , about thirty miles off the coast , two sails were sighted : one a small vessel standing in towards the land , and the other a larger ship , which had headed up , apparently to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British frigate , Captain Bainbridge headed offshore to get more sea-room . The fight between the Constitution and the Java then began , with the latter in chase , - just the reverse of the action with the Guerriere . The firing opened with broadsides from both ships , the Java being on the port quarter of the Constitution and about a mile to windward . As the English frigate was the faster sailer in the light wind which prevailed , she constantly overreached the Constitution , so that there was much manoeuvring to avoid being raked . The battle lasted a little over two hours , and both sides displayed splendid seamanship , but the end found the Java dismasted and helpless . As usual , the American gunnery had been vastly superior to that of the English , although the Constitution 's rigging was so badly cut up that she returned to the United States for repairs . Captain Bainbridge did not consider it practicable to get the Java home , and he accordingly burned her . Lieutenant Hoffman , who set fire to her , had performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days near San Salvador with the Hornet , whose intended victim had not yet come out , the Constitution laid her course for Boston , which she reached February 27 , 1813 , bearing the news of her own victory . She and her crew were received with the wildest enthusiasm , and the town turned out to do honor to the victors . What was better than all to Jack Tar , he received his prize-money for two ships captured within four and a half months . // After extensive repairs , under the direction of Captain Charles Stewart , who went in command of her , Old Ironsides got to sea again on January 1 , 1814 , for a cruise towards the Barbadoes . She captured a few small prizes and attempted to overhaul a British frigate , and was herself chased into the harbor of Marblehead on April 3 by two frigates on the blockade of the New England coast . Captain Stewart had to throw overboard a quantity of old rigging , provisions , and other heavy articles , to escape . He moved down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her last cruise during the war began on December 17 , 1814 , with a long reach to the Bay of Biscay by way of the Bermudas and the Madeiras . The morning of February 20 , 1815 , off the coast of Morocco , opened with a light mist over the sea and a variable wind . At one o'clock in the afternoon a sail hove in sight , followed within an hour by a second . They proved to be the British ships Cyane and Levant , carrying in all fiftyfive guns , firing a broadside weighing 754 pounds against the Constitution 's 654 . The Constitution made all sail to overhaul them , and opened fire on the Cyane , the sternmost ship , at four minutes past six . By fine maixeuvring and rapid handling of guns she played havoc with both English ships without permitting herself to be raked . At one time , when she had forged ahead enough to fire into the Levant , the Cyane attempted to pass astern of her to rake ; but Captain Stewart braced the yards flat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position alongside of the Cyane , into which he poured a withering fire . The Cyane surrendered at ten minutes to seven , and left the Constitution free to pursue the Levant . The prisoners were first removed and damages were repaired , so that it was two hours before the action began again . The Levant surrendered at ten o'clock . This whole action , covering about four hours , was fought by moonlight , and exhibits the wonderful agility of the Constitution under sail . Captain Stewart 's seamanship enabled him to manage two ships without suffering materially himself . The smoke from the guns obscured much of the movement . The British ships lost seventy-seven in killed and wounded , and the Constitution fourteen . The next day Captain Stewart made sail for Port Praya , Cape Verde Islands , the nearest neutral port , where he arrived with his two prizes seventeen days later . The discipline and readiness of the American sailors are again well deinonstrated by an occurrence on the very day after anchoring , when three frigates appeared in the offing . Not knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not respect the neutrality of the port , Captain Stewart made sail to get out of the harbor before the strangers came in . Within seven minutes after the first alarm his ships were all under weigh , standing out to sea . Thus began another of those lucky escapes for which the Constitution had become as famous as for her victories . She and her two prizes hugged the north shore of the island close hauled on the port tack , with the English squadron following and almost within gunshot . In fact , they tried firing at long range . While the Constitution easily held her own to windward , her antagonists weathered the Cyane and Levant . Hoping to divide their forces , Captain Stewart signaled to the Cyane to tack to the northwest , which she did , and in this way escaped . She reached New York without further incident . The same mannuvre was tried with the Levant , but the whole English squadron immediately turned in pursuit , and left the Constitution to sail away . She landed her prisoners at Maranham and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached her . Her last cruise during the war ended at New York on May 17 , 1815. // In the meantime , the Levant , finding escape impossible , had put into her anchorage at Port Praya , and was there retaken by the British ships , whose officers learned to their chagrin that it was the Constitution which had been thus deserted in order to retake an English prize . The subsequent career of Old Ironsides is soon told . Her period of intense activity had passed , and she had won eternal fame by three great victories and three wonderful escapes . After six years of rest she was to carry her country 's flag to distant ports for the protection of American merchant-ships in peaceful pursuits , until superseded by the new agent , which was even then beginning to change the construction of ships and to render them independent of wind and wave . Between the years 1821 and 1838 she made two long cruises to the Mediterranean , for the purpose of holding the piratical states on the southern shore to their treaties . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a prolonged stay in Boston , when the Secretary of the Navy came near accomplishing what no enemy had ever succeeded in doing , - forcing her to strike her flag . He recommended to the navy commissioners that she be broken up , as the cost of repairing her hull promised to equal her original cost . The popular clamor aroused by the publication of this decision resulted in the saving of the frigate . Oliver Wendell Holmes 's poem , Old Ironsides , dashed off in the heat of indignation , did much to create an irresistible public sentiment . It was published in every newspaper through the land , and circulated in handbills at Washington . " Ay , tear her tattered ensign down ! Long has it waved on high , And many an eye has danced to see That banner in the sky . " The necessary money was appropriated , and the ship was practically rebuilt at Boston without alteration of model or plan . No sooner had the excitement subsided than sbe was plunged once more into a discussion more bitter than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up , but there was a very rancorous difference about the propriety of Andrew Jackson as a figurehead . The commandant of the Navy Yard , thinking to please the President and his admirers , had procured a finely carved statue of him , and had placed it under the bowsprit . It raised a great storm of indignation in Boston , and Commodore Elliott put a guard over the ship to protect her against threatened attack . On a dark night , however , during a heavy rain , Samuel Dewey crossed the Charles in a small boat , and , within sight of a sentry posted near by , sawed off the head , which he brought away as a trophy of his exploit . He subsequently carried it to Washington . A new figure-head of Jackson , put on immediately afterwards , remained until 1876 . From 1838 to 1855 the ship was successively in the Atlantic , the Asiatic , the Mediterranean , and the African squadrons , with occasional visits to home ports for repairs . Her commander in China was Captain John Percival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been impressed by the English from an American merchant-ship . By his intelligence and energy Percival rose in the English service , and was captain of the foretop on Nelson 's flag-ship at Trafalgar . As the Constitution went out to China by the way of Cape Horn , and returned through the India seas , her voyage extended completely around the globe . Her cruising days may be said to have ended with her return to Portsmouth , N. H. , in 1855 , where she lay housed over until the outbreak of the rebellion , when she was taken to Annapolis . Once more she made one of her miraculous escapes . She was nearly defenseless , and the opportune arrival of // the Eighth Massachusetts Regiment , under General Butler , saved her from falling into the hands of the Confederates . Her moorings were slipped , and she was towed over the bar by a steamer seized from Confederate owners . A tug from Havre de Grace carried her to New York , whence she was taken to Newport as a school-ship for the Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there rebuilt for the Exposition of 1876 . She made a voyage to Havre in 1878 for the purpose of transporting goods to the Paris Exposition , and her return early in 1879 was , as usual , full of incident . With a cargo of goods on board she ran aground at Ballard 's Point , England , only a few hours out from Havre , and had to be taken to an English dockyard for examination . A few days later , when clear of the Channel , her rudderhead was wrenched off , and she put into Lisbon for repairs . The voyage to New York ended on May 24 , 1879 . After use for a short time as a training-vessel for naval apprentices , she was taken to Portsmouth , N. H. , where she remained , housed over as a receiving-ship , until she was brought to B@ston on September 18 , 1897 . Frequent rebuilding and renewal of parts have changed her hull much as the human body is said to change with time , though the keel and floor timbers are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floated under Preble , Hull , Bainbridge , Stewart , and a host of other gallant seamen . The model has been carefully preserved . In reckoning up the services of the Constitution , it is well to consider the condition of the country during the period of her greatest activity . When she was built , the nation was only a handful of scattered colonies , without experience in wielding the instrument of government framed with infinite pains by our forefathers to foster and strengthen common interests and common action . There were no railroads or telegraph wires to bind us closer together , and to bring our States within easy reach of one another . Any measure by the chief executive and legislative powers which affected adversely the commerce of a section was certain to be followed by talk and threats of separation . We had no background of history to draw upon as a reserve force in national crises . If the war of 1812 was the second war of independence , it was likewise the first for the Union . It was thought by many to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens of one great country , and it taught us something about the relation of the separate States to the central government in the organization for war , and thus strengthened the North to withstand the shock of fifty years later . During the first eight years of our existence as a nation we had no navy , and we could not be taken seriously even by the countries with which hundreds of our ships traded . The merchant-ships were prey to any armed vessel which chose to take out of them either men or money . The spectacle of a frigate loaded down with a valuable cargo of merchandise and dollars , and sent as a present to the dey of Algiers to purchase a peaceful trade in the Mediterranean , is the most humiliating in our whole history . The manning of such a vessel by former American slaves of Algiers was the last touch required to complete the picture . Until we had proven our ability to strike hard blows , we were scarcely better off with the European powers . Our rights as neutrals were totally disregarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even our war-ships , to a slavery different only in kind from that in the Barbary States . As the flag-ship of a squadron which effectually broke up the system of tribute to a nest of pirates , the Constitution will forever deserve our gratitude ; and as the chief actor in a war which united the country in the maintenance // of its rights as a neutral power and of the immunity of its sailors from capture on the high seas , she must be handed down in bodily presence to our children . Let us take the words of a foreigner for an unprejudiced view of our position in naval matters . An accomplished French admiral writes as follows : " When the American Congress declared war on England in 1812 , it seemed as if this unequal conflict would crush her navy in the act of being born ; instead , it but fertilized the germ . . . . The English covered the ocean with their cruisers when this unknown navy , composed of six frigates and a few small craft hitherto hardly numbered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel , in the very centre of fhe British power . But already the Constitution had captured the Guerriere and the Java , the United States had made a prize of the Macedonian , the Wasp of the Frolic , and the Hornet of the Peacock . The honor of the new flag was established . " It is small wonder we exulted , perhaps too extravagantly , over Hull 's victory . May we not say that this triumph so early in the war exerted a strong influence in turning the common people of Massachusetts against the wild talk of separation ? The Boston Centinel , which had condemned the war most unsparingly , heartily rejoiced in the achievements " which placed our gallant officers and hardy tars on the very pinnacle of the high hill of honor , and which established the necessity and utility of a navy . " " This honor and usefulness must thunder in the ears of the navy-haters in high places . Give us a navy . " This ship , launched from a Boston shipyard , commanded by a Yankee sailor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trophy the standard of the invincible navy . The charm was broken , and other victories on the sea followed fast , to prove to the world the existence of an independent nation on this side of the Atlantic . If the first triumph had given a " tone and character to the war , " the Constitution had done more : she had given tone and character to the nation for all time . Although the treaty at the close of the war of 1812 left us very much where we were before , the actual result was to give us standing before the world and complete freedom on the sea . The English have ever been a brave and chivalrous people , but their respect and consideration have been measured largely by the power of a nation to strike back . Our forefathers ' children on both sides of the water have met in friendship and mutual good feeling on the deck of Old Ironsides many times since 1815 . The old ship can not be dismissed without some reference to her successor in the annals of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Monitor have certain curious points of resemblance and of difference . Both were departures in type from what had gone before , and both wrought great changes in the construction of warvessels for the navies of Europe . One stands to-day as the most beautiful example of the old sailing frigate ; the other was but the crude beginning of the modern battle-ship . Both gained their victories over people of the same race and blood and the same maritime traditions . The Constitution went boldly out from Boston in the face of tremendous odds , and the Monitor left New York as a forlorn hope . It is strange that both should have sailed just before a change of orders could reach them . One is almost persuaded to see in this the hand of a good Providence which favored our country . The most important effect of victory in both conflicts was a moral one : in the first case putting heart into the nation , and in the second infusing hope and courage into the North . Washington took a deep interest in the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial of the Mon // itor . Both ships have served in the fulfillment of our destiny as a great and united nation . Monuments in wood were thought by the Greeks to be fitting memorials of strife between people of the same blood . The Constitution still survives , - a hull which has renewed itself with every generation as our most precious memorial of the nation 's glory . Let those who fear the temptations of a growing navy contrast our foreign relations before the coming of the Constitution and our present position in the family of nations . The lack of ships then carried us swiftly into war , as the possession of them now will form the surest pledge of peace .
