HE fields of the writer and actor are different . The one through the published word , if it be seasoned with wit and grace , reaches out to the ends of the earth . The other is much more in the eyes of men , and if he be a really great man is the observed of all observers ; but if he is to live in successive generations , he must have the engaging writer to recount his deeds , or his name is lost to the world . Thus the writer is indispensable to the actor if his name is to be handed down to posterity , and the actor is necessary to the writer if he is to have fitting subjects in which he can display his skill . Dr. Johnson was a great writer and a puissant individuality during the latter half of the eighteenth century ; but , magnificent as his prose style is , - a style which has had vitality enough to live down to the present time , - he is chiefly known to us to-day by the indefatigability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hero worship have combined to produce the most fascinating biography in the language , through which Doctor Samuel Johnson is to-day one of the most interesting characters in English literature . It is by virtue of the gifts of Boswell that Dr. Johnson is an unspeakable delight to us . Boswell is simply a person aside , and yet to him we owe the entertainment which the character of Dr. Johnson supplies us with . Perhaps the self-effacement of a great writer is his most commendable quality . It takes one man to live a notable life , and it takes the best work of another man to make the story of the first man 's life interesting and engaging . The late James Parton , like his great predecessor , James Boswell , was the prince among biographers of this country . Whether his subject was a friend or JAMES PARTON . // a foe , whether he believed in the integrity and principles of the man or not , he brought the signal quality of unswerving truthfulness and impartiality to his work ; and his ability to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never think of the writer *tpart from his work . He reaches the highest point of good work , which is the forgetfulness of self . Mr. Parton is remarkable among the writers of his time for this quality . George Bancroft struts through his " History of the United States , " like a turkey gobbler in a barnyard , conscious at every step that he is bigger than his subject . We have no more striking instance of self-consciousness in our literature , unless it may be in the whoops of Walt Whitman ; but even Whitman 's utterances are the words of a man who has seen a vision . It is necessary , in order that Mr .. Parton 's work should be rightly appreciated , that he should be neither exalted as if he were what he was not , nor misunderstood in his true capacity and outreach . He was a very gifted and remarkable man , but he belonged not to the rank of men of genius , but to the small and distinct class of men who do their work without pushing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing things and describing them as they are . He would be the last to claim a rank for himself that did not belong to him . He was not a man without opinions and convictions , but he was too well-rounded not to respect the convictions of others and not to know his place . If he did not see the whole of a subject , he did not pretend that he did . A more absolutely honest man I have never known . When he trusted others , which was not the work of a moment , he trusted with his whole nature . He had been so accustomed for many years to using his experiences objectively and to making his materials do duty in print that his whole intellectual life was as responsive to his will as the keys of the piano to the intentions of the player . He rejoiced like most literary workers in a few friends , well chosen , to whora he could speak with entire freedom . It was my privilege to enjoy this freedom of access to him ; and although we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something more than communicative , and we found amid wide differences of opinion that there was a large range of common ground between us . He had no enmities to others , no fads to be treated tenderly , no whims to be allowed for , but was a simple , earnest , resolute , . hard-working man , who had his bread to earn , and who tried to do his duty in the position where he found himself . I did not know him until he had been living for several years in Newburyport and had begun to buy his leisure . He was then busy on the " Life of Voltaire , " and was full of enthusiasm over his hero . He liked to talk of his work at such times to a sympathetic person , and he always said things that were unconventional . He saw sharply and keenly the vital things of life either in his heroes or in the persons of his own time , and his talk was seasoned with these suggestive points . To talk with him for an hour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month for one engaged in daily editorial writing . Though Mr. Parton was not an unconventional many and had no oddities to speak of , he saw things intellectually in an unconventional light , and his talk , without in any sense being affected , was suggestive and racy beyond that of almost any man I have ever known . He liked to meet his neighbors , his acquaintances among laboring men , the boys who lived near him , . and strangers , and to talk with them for five or ten minutes as he might have opportunity , and in this way he came to have a large social influence and did a great amount of good . He never seemed to have any aim in this matter , but simply talked out of the goodness of his mind and heart , making himself felt , , wherever he was , as a social force . He undoubtedly was picking up materials all the time , which could be wrought into his writings , but it never seemed to others that he was interviewing them , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he talked . He had high ideas of literary art and service . He would not do hasty work . He was methodical , patient , regular and persistent , and in time he had become so able to control his mind that it responded to // his will like the body to his mind . He did not tax himself to work out great feats within a short time , or if he was hard pressed he gave himself rest as soon as the strain was over . He did not burn midnight oil , neither did he resort to wine or tobacco as stimulants to his brain . He was one of the most temperate men I have ever known . He kept his faculties every day as near as he could at their best , and life flowed on from day to day with an evenness and a quietness that made his home life not only pleasant for others but beautiful in itself . His habits were to breakfast about halfpast seven , then to work in his garden in the summer for an hour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure to be undisturbed until half-past twelve . Then he dined , and after that , in his later years , took a nap . Then he was ready for callers or visits to friends , or for the reading which might be required for the work of the next day . After tea he was usually the companion of his family , hearing his wife or niece read aloud some book or magazine ; and this was his daily round , unless broken in upon , month after month , year in and year out . He did not often go to Boston or New York , or seek a large number of literary acquaintances , and yet he was never unsocial . He was the light and life of two clubs in Newburyport , and he was extremely fond of a good square talk , in which he was fired up to his utmost . In early life he had an extremely quick temper ; he could not argue his case without getting into a heat ; but such was his control of himself by the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passion had passed away , and he could master himself with ease . The facts of his personal career are few and without much public interest , and yet they are the waymarks in a life which if spent in soberness and industry and in quiet retreats , was not without its throes and disappointments and struggles and success . Mr. Parton was born in the cathedral town of Canterbury , England , February 9 , 1822 . His ancestors were originally French millers and farmers , and had emigrated to Canterbury at the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 . His father died when he was four years old , and one of his earliest memories was that of walking across afield in black clothes to attend his funeral . This had such a sombre effect upon him that he never after that date liked to conform to the usual rules prescribed for mourning in the family . One of his last counsels to the household before his own decease was that they should not follow the custom of mourning at his funeral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family removed to this country when James was five years old . He was educated in the schools of New York . city and at White Plains , N. V. In the latter place , he began studies preparatory for college . He was in a boardingschool , where subsequently he became an assistant teacher . It was the distinction of this school that it manufactured Christians . It bore a great reputation , because nearly every boy who passed through it became a member of the Church . Young Parton here for the first time saw that religion was used as a cloak for hypocrisy and bigotry , and a an aid to business . This did not lead him to give up his position as teacher , . but it compelled great searchings of heart as to the reality of the religion which then passed current in society . He could not go to college because he had no money to pay his expenses , but used to get up early in the morning for extra work , and studied Greek in those hours much further than the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually in after years he dropped it and didnot take it up again . He next found himself in Philadelphia , where he was associated with Samuel Edwards , afterwards an Episcopal clergyman , in the charge of an English and classical school , for the prepafation of boys for college , and in this school he was very successful . He used to live much with his pupils , and was greatly beloved by them . On Saturday afternoons he would take nearly the whole school on walks to notable localities around Philadel-. phia , or to paper mills or to foundries or other manufacturing places , and explain to them the principles which were here inoperation // and the part which these interests had in the business of life . He had what was regarded by his pupils as an ideal school . He was very fond of teaching ; he had a passion for it , natural instinct and capacity to convey information to others in a pleasant way , and he used to say that if he were an emperor his greatest joy would be to institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers in the highest rank in that order . Doubtless he would have been a teacher all the rest of his life , had it not been that the seed of religious doubt which had been sown in his mind at White Plains had begun to bear fruit . In 1846 the Rev. Dr. Richard Newton of Philadelphia , a young Episcopal clergyman of about his own age , delivered a course of six sermons on doctrinal subjects , intended to help young persons to a correct belief . Mr. Parton attended them , and when they were concluded went to Mr. Newton to know if he had anything to add to what he had said ; but the young divine had no message for one who had begun to seriously question the reality of supernatural religion . Mr. Parton subsequently slowly reached the conclusion that Christianity , as it is commonly understood , had no reality in the natural order of things , and rejected it as a system not to be believed . Before this he had been in the habit of opening his school with prayer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that hereafter the school would be opened without prayer . He made no explanations , and resorted to no subterfuges , but the result was that he was soon obliged to give up the school . it broke up the future for him and left him without an occupation . He returned to New York city , where he waited for something to turn up . Before this he had written but little , and his first literary work was done for the pleasure of it . Mr. N. P. Willis was then in the heyday of his reputation as a literary man , and was conducting the Home Journal . Mr. Parton sent in his first contribution at this time , not knowing whether he had the literary gift or not . It was an article on " Jane Eyre , " and he discussed the question whether the author was a man or a woman , inclin ing to the latter view . He sent this contribution in by stealth , and as it was not printed for two or three weeks he thought that Mr. Willis regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picking up a copy of the Home Journal shortly after , he found that his essay had been printed in full . He had been anxious to recall it , but now he was glad that he had not done so . This little incident had more to do with his direction toward a literary career than anything else . He was shortly after engaged by Mr. Willis to write regularly for the Home Journal , at $io a week . The next step in the development of his literary career was taken about 1850 . While he was employed on the Home Journal he remarked one day to a New York publisher that an interesting story could be made out of the life of Horace Greeley . When asked why he did not do it , he said that it would require an expensive journey and a year of labor , and that he had not the money to support himself while writing it . The publisher offered to advance him money , and he began at once to collect materials from the neighbors of Horace Greeley in Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appeared in New York in 1855 as the " Life of Horace Greeley . " It was published when Mr. Greeley had risen to the height of his fame as the editor and proprietor of the New York Tribune , and was a fresh and typical biography of a notable American . It made a great sensation in the literary world , and at once introduced the author into a new field . It caused him to be widely known , and led him to devote himself henceforth to authorship as a profession . He also began at this time to write on various political and literary topics . He now made his first ventures upon the lecture platform , which was then a great field of literary effort in New England , and soon found himself one of the notable men of the day . His next book was a collection of " The Humorous Poetry of the English Language from Chaucer to Saxe , " which was published in 1856 by Ticknor &amp; Fields , of Boston . While it was only a piece of literary editorship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone through many editions . In January , 1856 , he was married to Sara Payson Willis , then a widow with two children , who had lifted herself out of straitened circumstances by her pen , and had become well known as a writer under the fictitious name of " Fanny Fern , " which she signed to her first piece , and by which she grew famous before even her friends knew that she was a writer at all . He made her acquaintance in New York city while he was the assistant of her brother in the office of the Home Journal . She had begun to write for the New York Ledger in 1854 , a connection which she retained to the end of her life , and in which she was joined by her husband not long after . The two found in Mr. Robert Bonner a liberal and intimate personal friend , who regarded their joint contributions as of signal value to his paper , and who paid for them liberally . Mr. Parton , indeed , became such a constant contributor to the Ledger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of its regular staff ; and retained that position until near the end of his life . If the full history of Mr. Bonner 's business relations , which were always supplemented by friendly relations , with Mr. Parton and " Fanny Fern " could be related , it would be one of the most honorable and delightful statements of friendship and helpfulness which could be related . Mr. Bonner still survives , and if he should ever feel inclined to give his reminiscences of his relations to literary people , his dealings with the Partons as publisher and friend would be a delightful episode . It was of the greatest service to Mr. Parton that he was able to make a regular engagement with Mr. Bonner on the Ledger . It provided a steady income for himself and his wife , and by this means he was able to take hold of the really great works which now remain as monuments of his wise and sagacious industry . His first effort , after finishing the Greeley volume , was to write the " Life and Times of Aaron Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it he attempted to restore to Burr the outlines of a man . Burr had been painted as a devil . Mr. Parton never desired to make him a popular character or a hero , and was vexed and amused when such an intention was attributed to him . He neither admired Burr nor wished others to do so ; he simply thought him interesting , and tried to make him appear so to others . He made no attempt to blot out the dark spots in his career or to apologize for him . He was immensely attracted by the romance of Burr 's life , and he showed* in this work great ability to handle political facts and give them their place and order in a popular narrative . His next undertaking was the " Life of Andrew Jackson . " In writing this work , as in writing the one on Aaron Burr , he had access to abundant and original materials . He visited New Orleans and the surviving friends of Jackson , and sought to make a photographic picture of the times in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another struggling literary adventurer at this time is a noteworthy illustration of the character of Mr. Parton . He had saved from his earnings the sum of $200 , which he intended to use in making a trip to New Orleans in order to gather materials for the biography of Jackson . He was approached in New York by an impecunious poet , since widely known to fame , who was in great distress and needed badly that amount . He assured Mr. Parton that he could command the money , whenever he required it , and with this assurance Mr. Parton loaned , this little fund , reserved for his Southern trip , in good faith . It did not improve his trust in human nature to find that the poet had betrayed his confidence and had told . a falsehood in order to extort money from him , and that Mr. Parton was simply one more of the persons who had placed confidence in the wrong man . The money was never returned , and Mr. Parton , a wiser and a poorer man , had to devise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means with which to make the journey for gathering the materials that xvould give a graphic interest to his story of the life of Andrew Jackson . Another misfortune befel him in bringing out this work . A large subscription list had been obtained in the South , where // Andrew Jackson was best known , and he was depending upon the payment of these subscriptions on the delivery of the first volume . Hardly had the first of the three volumes been published , when the civil war broke out , and it was utterly impossible for the book to be delivered or to secure the payment of the subscriptions . A work from which he had hoped to reap a sum sufficient to secure his literary independence was almost devoid of profit , and the second and third volumes were published at a heavy loss to his publishers and himself . After the war was over it had a reasonably large sale , but nothing like what it would have had if the civil war had not broken in upon his fortunes . While the conflict was raging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Nexv Orleans that he wrote to General Butler and proposed to prepare a work upon his administration at New Orleans , if the general would give his consent . The doughty chieftain was greatly pleased with Mr. Parton 's offer , and granted him every facility to write an impartial account of what he did during the war in that southern city . Mr. Parton composed a large part of this work at General Butler 's home , having full command of his papers and his per sonal explanations , though the general did not read a line of it , except a page picked up by chance , until it was finished . Mr. Parton was not much given to hero worship , and while his subsequent relations to General Butler were always friendly , the breach between them in opinions and in principles constantly widened . It was the general 's natural abilities which chiefly commanded his admiration . He very strongly disapproved of many of his public acts and utterances , which was natural for one who always acted on his own information and judgment ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated and found a warm response until the end . When Mr. Parton first visited Newburyport , he was a guest of General Butler , who was sailing in his yacht along the North Shore . He was favorably impressed with the water views and rural beauty of the place . Several years later , when his wife 's daughter and her niece , then an orphan , were seeking a less expensive home than New York , his favorable impressions of Newburyport as a quiet New England city revived , and he suggested that Miss Eldredge should take her niece to this place and make it her permanent home . Mr. Parton was at this time himself in the deepest affliction from the loss of his intimate companion in letters , his faithful and devoted wife , and his interest in " Fanny Fern 's " granddaughter was all the more intense from his close relation to her by marriage . When Miss Eldredge removed to Newburyport and had established her home there , Mr. Parton proposed that she should allow him to become a member of the family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the little company might live in a home instead of a boarding-house . He proposed to give her the house , but she was unwilling to accept it from him , and it was finally arranged that Mr. Parton shbuld remain in the family as a boarder , and that his wife 's daughter should pay him rent as her landlord . He could not bear to be separated from these dear friends , and in his then shattered and broken life the care of this little girl , whose name was Ethel , and who afterwards took the family name of Parton , was a great corn-* fort and satisfaction . Out of the common interest of the aunt of this child and of the grandfather by marriage in her future welfare , there sprang up a new and unexpected affection , that resulted in the marriage of Miss Eldredge to Mr. Parton in the spring of 1876 , three years after they had established their home in Newburyport . This new relation was almost a literal fulfilment of the Scripture " And a little child shall lead them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , made the marriage invalid , Mr. Parton , who was the soul of honor in his domestic as well as his private life , immediately separated from his wife , and they did not live together until the marriage had been legally consummated in another state . Great happiness came to him through this new relationship in the last fifteen 4 // years of his life . In the new home what was left of the old one was built into new foundations . It was a case where family friendships ripened by easy stages into the deepest and strongest love . Mrs. Parton did not inherit the literary genius of " Fanny Fern , " but developed as a domestic woman , and found her highest happiness in being a wife and mother . It was in this delightful home that I first met Mr. Parton , perhaps ten years ago . To cross that threshold was to step into radiant sunshine . You could not pend an hour in Mr. Parton 's society there without realizing that he was a happy man . At my first visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine in every direction ; a bright girl , now fifteen , who can swim like a fish and skate like a boy , and who lives a truly natural life , without ceasing to be a genuine girl ; and a lad , now thirteen years old , named Hugo , after the celebrated Frenchman whom Mr. Parton so greatly admired , a youth who perhaps thinks more of hunting and fishing and swimming and playing ball than of books . Though Mr. Parton was always rather delicate , he shared in athletic sports in his youth . He was a good pedestrian and an expert swimmer , easily making more than a mile at a stretch . He could manage a row-boat or a sail-boat , and he played most of the boyish games . On his return from a year 's sojourn in England when he came to be of age , one of the treasureshe brought back was a complete set of cricketing apparatus . He took good care , when he had children of his own , that their brain power should be well complemented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his house as a playground where his boy could invite other boys and make a playcentre for the neighborhood . He used to say : " These children can be young but once , and it is our duty to provide all the joy we can for them . " There were fine currant bushes on one side of this playground ; and when some one remarked to him that the boys stole his currants , he replied with a sly smile : " Did you ever know ripe currants to stay on the bushes when boys were near them ? " He had unbounded resources in the direction of home life , and it was this and his good citizenship which gave him a strong hold upon the people of Newburyport . His grounds permitted of good skating , and , to the horror of the staid citizens , he allowed the boys to skate there with his own children on Sundays . Some of his good conservative neighbors were a little shocked , but Mr Parton was so much beloved that it died down like a quick fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conducted through this playground , and through the stable , which was turned into a playroom for rainy days , and over the rear lot , where a swing had been erected among the apple trees , and which was in active use during the Sunday afternoon I was there . Never was a millionnaire happier in showing a friend over his magnificent home than Mr. Parton was in setting forth the excellences of what he had provided in a simple manner for his children ; and it was in moments like these that the essential goodness of the man appeared to the best advantage . He used to say that he was prouder of his early peas than of any book he ever wrote , and he thought so much of them in the season that one day he referred to a column of peas , when he intended to describe a row : literature and gardening were in very close relations . He used to coast with his children and live in the same atmosphere with them . He never exacted from them a great deference . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow was out of patience with his father because he did not catch the ball well , and burst out in his temper : " I could do better if I had a fellow that could hold me . " At another time , observing a scratch on the end of Hugo 's nose , which had the Roman shape , and asking what was the matter with it , he got the instant reply , " Roman punch Though he had no fondness for animal life , children and animals always took to him . A little kitten used to steal up into his study and curl up in one corner of his desk while he was writing , and children whom even their mothers could not easily control were always happy in his arms or in his presence . He had an intense hatred of cruelty , and if he ever found a // boy inflicting injury upon animals , that boy was not allowed to escape from his hands without an attempt to persuade him to better things ; and he seldom failed in inducing the boy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his little son ask him questions , and few men ever basked more in the sunshine of their children than he did . He used to say that he never knew a woman to amount to much in after life who was not something of a tomboy when she was a girl . The culmination of Mr. Parton 's home life was when the day 's work was done . He kept to his study in the morning , and always had a mid-day dinner . The tea was not a substantial meal , and when it was over the real enjoyment of the day began . Mr. Parton usually sat in one corner of the room , and liked to have every member of the family contribute to the evening 's entertainment . The older ones in their turn read aloud ; and in - this way the children , as soon as they were old enough , had an introduction to some of the best authors of the day . Howells and George Eliot and Kipling and Miss Jewett and Miss Wilkins were mutually enjoyed in this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening recreation became the chief family entertainment of the day . He had no greater pleasure than in being read to by his wife and adopted daughter , and it was their special happiness to contribute in this way to his enjoyment . It is not surprising that it was difficult to persuade him to go outside to spend his evenings ; and yet he was a pretty constant attendant at the two social and literary clubs which Newburyport maintains , and one of their most valued members . He was a good talker , and neither con* versed nor thought in strictly conventional channels ; but he had learned to maintain his opinions with so much frankness and courtesy to others that even the orthodox members of these clubs treated him with great respect , though they might not accept his opinions . It was characteristic of him that he should make much of the household when he came to have a home of his own , and one of his pleasantest essays discusses the duty of being agreeable at home and at the table . One of his sayings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward of living . " When the end of his life was evidently coming on through a slow illness which centered in an affection of the heart , he recognized it to be a duty to keep the home cheerful for the sake of others . He said to his wife concerning the children : " Do not destroy their cheerfulness ; " and they were allowed to go to school as usual until two days before he died , being kept till then in ignorance of what was impending . It was in the spirit of this intense domestic feeling that after the birth of his first child he always called his wife " Mother . " His study , when he first went to live in Newburyport , was on the first floor , and was what had been used by former occupants as the parlor . It was filled with books from floor to ceiling . It contained the larger part of his library , and it was an interesting place to be in . It was essentially a literary workroom . His books had been bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . You could trace the progress of his thought or the evolution of his books by looking at the documents and volumes on particular shelves of his library . It was really representative of his work . The books which we all enjoy the best were not numerous in his collection , and those which he wished to read the most he used to say that he never had time to read . In his case , as in that of most other men of , letters who are constant writers , the reading demanded by one 's work materially cut short the reading that one would like to do as an element of culture ; but by giving his evenings to literary recreation he was able to enjoy a great deal of the lighter literature of the day . Nearly every man 's library shows the lines of his thinking , and Mr. Parton 's was such that one could write his biography to a certain extent by carefully looking through his library . Works on philosophy and religion were few and scattered , but volumes on American leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in French , and he had large collections which he had specially made with reference to his biographies of the early leaders of the government . His library // was unique in its character , containing ery largely what you could find nowhere else , and having comparatively few of the books that everybody owns . In this literary den , where he received few persons besides his intimate friends , he wrought at the " Life of Voltaire " ; and the numerous works which he used in the writing of that biography bear witness to-day to the thoroughness and fidelity with which he executed his task . Beyond his library , the atmosphere of his home was not especially that of a man of letters , and yet it was a characteristic remark made to me once by Mrs. Parton : " I am so accustomed to living with a literary man , that I see everything in the process of being worked up . " After Mr. Parton had bought and refitted his latest home , which was prepared for his special use , though it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , where John Foster had his , in the part of his house which would have been the attic in other houses . It was one-half of the floor that was nearest to the sky , not very high studded , but a place which was fitted to hold perhaps five or six thousand volumes , and was filled with shelves for books on all sides , excepting the space* occupied by windows and doors . He'did most of his writing sitting in a low *sy chair in one corner , and resting his man ? i*cript on a large laphoard that lay on his knees . This study and library still remains as the great biographer left it on the day that he died , October 17 , 1891 . He never allowed himself to he interrupted when he had retired into this upper room to work ; nd it was here that his contributions to the Ledger and the You 1/i 's Oornpanion were written in the last four or five years of his life . There is a tender interest in the customary quarters of literary men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you sit in their chairs or write at their desks , or dip your pen into their inkstands . Their greatness does not inspire you , but you enter into a closer realization of what they did and how they felt . It was with deep emotion that I entered this retreat for the first time after Mr. Parton had showed it to me as the realization of his ideas of literary restfulness , attended by his wife and daughter , and conscious that its presiding genius would be there no more . Mr. Parton had true ideas in regard to the way in which people with literary gifts should manage their time and their incomes . He used to say with Aristotle that the great thing in the world for a man who had brains was to buy his leisure , if possible , before his brain power was used up and he was unable to employ it for creative or original work . For twenty years he labored upon the " Life of Voltaire , " making it to him a costly and toilsome work , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in order to live deeply and thoroughly into the period of which he was writing . He constantly advised younger literary workers to lay by every dollar they could spare , in order that they might have something to fall back upon when they were at the maturity of their powers . Few men have lived among us with a more entire dependence upon literature for support than Mr. Parton did , and few have been more prudent and economical and wise in reserving something for old age and for the time when one wishes to do unremunerative work . He did not become a rich man , but from the Ledger and from the Youth 's Companion he received a steady and liberal income for his weekly contributions , and in such spare time as he could reserve amid his weekly engagements he did the work which will preserve his memory in our literature and among our men of letters . After Mr. Parton had finished the work on " Gen. Butler in New Orleans , " he wrote the " Life and Times of Benjamin Vranklin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career to the American people . This biography is regarded as his best work , though he believed that the " Life of Voltaire " was his most important ' achievement . The " Life of Jefferson " was prepared ten years later , and was perhaps the biography , out of all that he wrote , in which his mind and heart were most closely in sympathy with the subject . He had lived so much in the revolutionary days , and knew so much about the men who then controlled // opinion and were actors in public affairs , that he felt and often expressed a sense of gentlemanly obligation and fellowship to men like Jefferson and Franklin , and he used to dignify them as Mr. Jefferson , and Mr. Franklin , and Mr. Hamilton . The Hamilton family were very " touchy " about his treatment of their g-reat ancestor , but it was impartial . No one ever doubted it save the Hamiltons and a few of their friends , and even they never brought forward any facts to support their criticisms . It was characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he understood it . Thomas Jefferson was his ideal politician . He considered Alexander Hamilton a man of unwise political judgment . Mr. Parton 's opinions were strong on the political struggles of our young nation , but they were founded upon an impartial examination of the facts , and these he strove fairly to present . Voltaire was his ideal of an impartial religionist , and his " Life of Voltaire " fully expressed his conception of what a great biography ought to be . It gave everything about Voltaire and his age that had any possible interest , and it practically painted the manners and thoughts and moralities of the i8th century , as they bore upon his career . Nothing was omitted because it told against him , and nothing was said for him that was not strictly true . Open this book at any point , and you are immediately interested in the narrative . The author never expresses his opinions , but leaves his author to speak for himself . Voltaire was a man of unparalleled activity , and Mr. Parton follows him with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . If any mistake was made , it was in giving too many facts about him . The world has something else to do than to read 1200 octavo pages about even the greatest man of the *8th century . In the lives of Jefferson and Jackson and Franklin , as well as in the early book on Greeley , there was a large and interested audience ready to appreciate his work ; but Voltaire was already a fading figure in the last century , and this effort to fully appreciate him was produced when the persons interested deeply in him are few and far between . Mr. Morley , who has written with singular insight into the career of Voltaire , and into the lives of the principal leaders in the French revolution , highly appreciated Mr. Parton 's work . Nothing more painstaking has ever been done for the great European liberal of a century ago . He regarded this biography as the finality of his literary life , and after it was completed he did not undertake any other work of large scope . Other writings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has passed away , to be reproduced in a new form . They include his splendid monographs in the North Amerz*i-an Review , * in the years when it was edited by Mr. Lowell and Prof. Norton . The papers which he wrote on Webster and Calhoun , 1 on Chicago , and New Vork City , and Girard College and its founder , were in his best vein , frank and fearless statements of truth . Mr. Parton never feared to tell the truth , and in these monographs he surpassed himself . He did a vast amount of work that was simply literary drudgery . He liked to speak to these wider and less literary audiences , and sometimes wondered if he was accomplishing more in that way than in oring upon works better in themselves and more delightful to himself . He had to do it to swell out his income . He seldom wrote anything which ' did not have pith and point . One of hi* latest books , " Captains of Industry , " was drawn from these contributions , and is a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred by books in which the great turning points in the lives of others are presented to them . All his literary work was conscientiously and honestly done , whether it was intended to add a penny to his income or was written with a view to the interests of literature . He never wrote a line to the discredit of the truth or good morals , or persons who deserved well of others . His literary career was without stain or blemish . It only remains to speak of him on a point on which he differed from a great portion of his fellow citizens . He was one who had given up the belief in suThese papers were republished long ago in " Famous Americans of Recent Times , " hut much of his later work is still uncollected. // pernatural religion . This was not accompanied with the giving up of a belief in good morals , or with any throwing of discredit upon the truth as others received it . What Mr. Parton believed he believed with all his heart . Duty and beauty were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to go beyond them . He disliked a bigoted Liberal as much as a bigoted Christian , and he had keen sympathy with those free religionists who take destructive positions , and with Colonel Ingersoll in particular ; but he considered building up better than tearing down , and believed that the mission of the destructives was now nearly over . Formerly he had given his services with pen , voice and ready money to the cause of liberalism , both destructive and progressive ; and this he never regretted , though in later years he ceased to do so . The last time I met him he told me that he had begun to go to church , - the Unitarian Church in Newburyport ; and he said that he liked it , that it was refreshing to go there , and that there was great social strength in it . He was deeply interested in the moral instruction of his children , and took the utmost pains with them at home . He was also interested in the service at church , so far as the music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year of his life he was heard to express a doubt whether , after all , it were best for him to go to the public service , A Corner in Mr. Partons Study , lest he should appear thereby to lend countenance to the practice of prayer , which he considered humiliating and debasing , and which it was always painful for him to witness or to hear . But I never knew Mr. Parton to say what would hurt needlessly the feelings of any one . He did what he thought was right in his own eyes , and at all times his utterances on these subjects were honest and frank and manly . He was never a controversialist . In regard to the future he felt that he did not know what he would like to , and that he must wait patiently for larger knowledge . This was his position in life , and in this longing for the certainty of a larger hope he died . His ideal Sunday of the future was that societies should exist like parishes and should devote themselves on Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had . When men who had natural gifts for preaching could be obtained , they should preach ; and when they could not be had , there should be a service in which the finest things in moral literature should be presented . He would have all the arts of life on its beautiful side set forth most fully in social work among the people . I think that Mr. Parton mellowed a great deal in his feelings on religious subjects toward the end of his life , but I have no evidence that he changed his lifelong convictions . He lived and died a believer in simply natural religion . He was very fond of the writings of Keats , Tennyson , Whittier , Longfellow , Lowell , and of the best translations of Homer , of whom he never tired , and of Shakespeare above all others , whose choice passages he could reel off by the yard ; but Robert Browning he could not endure . In poetry he cared a great deal more for beauty than duty . He enjoyed the perfect play of words as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the exquisite use of language to clothe a thought or represent a scene . Nothing interested him more than to meet with persons whose occupations were entirely different from his own , and a great many of the laboring people in Newburyport were accustomed to stop to talk with him when they met him in the streets . The Roman Catholics liked him , and people of all denominations recognized his quiet and wholesome influence in the community . It was notable that at his funeral there was a very large attendance of poor people and children , those who knew him and loved him ; and at this last gathering of friends around his silent form there was no gloom , no lack of sunshine , and plenty of flowers . He was a lover of light ; he believed in light ; and when he was taken to his long home the hearts of those who followed him were full of huiman sorrow and yet also joyful in the hope for him of light beyond .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
