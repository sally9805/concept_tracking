txt State Detective John M. O. Marsh of this place saved his own life on Saturday night only by the utmost presence of mind and coolness on his part . Ten years ago Detective Marsh sent a man to State prison for a long term . The man vowed vengeance at the time against him for the part he took in the matter . This man was recently released , and repetitions of these threats have reached Detective Marsh 's ears . On Saturday night an attempt to murder the State detective by an infernal machine failed . In the evening mail a wooden box ten inches long , about two and one-half inches broad , and of the same thickness was received by the detective . The psesge was postmarked New York . Detective Marsh can not tell now what impelled him to view the box with suspicion . At any rate , he pried open the box with a screwdriver instead of sliding along the lid in its natural wooden groove . To his working so carefully and cautiously is due his escape from instant death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sandpaper . This rough surface rested upon three parlor matches placed upright , and connected by fuses to three long iron cylinders . As soon as the detective discovered the contents of the box he plunged the latterinto a pail of water . Then he clipped off a piece of the fuse and fired it . The fuse burned Ilse a flash . The detective telegraphed at once to Washington for an inspector connected with the postal detective service . To this inspector he will give up for analysis the cylinders and the whole infernal machine . The person who used the mails for the conveyance of the deadly machine is guilty of two heinous offenses  --  one of sending the box by mail , and the other of attempting to take the detective 's life .
