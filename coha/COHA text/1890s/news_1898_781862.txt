txt If we coin the seigniorage we give statutory sanction to a notorious lie . Under the Sherman act we bought 168 , - 674,682 fine ounces of silver at an average cost of 92.44 cents per ounce . Silver is now worth but 60 cents  --  a fall of 32 cents an ounce . We have lost $53,975,897 by the purchase , considered as a commercial transaction . The loss is actual and demonstrable . We bought a quantity of silver bullion for $155.931,002 . If we closed out the transaction to-day by putting the silver on the market we could get for it only $101,956,105 ? really much less , for if we should attempt to unload the stuff the price would break frantically . Yet in his amendment to the War Revenue bill Senator WOLCOTT treats this loss as a gain , and proposes that the Government shall issue certificates to the extent of $42 , - 000,000 against the supposed profit represented by the difference between 92.44 , the cost price of the bullion , and $1.29 , the coining value at the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge the House of Representatives to resist to the last extremity this vicious attempt to employ the war necessities of the Government to extort from it an admission , on the authority of the vote of Congress and the signature of the President , that BRYAN was right ; that the gold dollar is too dear , that we ought to cheat our creditors , and that the free , unlimited , and independent coinage of silver should henceforth be the cornerstone of our fiscal policy . That is what the adoption of the Wolcott amendment means . It embodies the essence , the vital principle , the original sin of silver free coinage . Its enactment would constitute an affirmation of the wisdom of the Bryanites , of the soundness of their financial maxims , and of the justice and worthiness of that cause which was defeated two years ago only after a campaign of tremendous exertions for the expenses of which great Sums were willingly contributed by men who were shaken with fear of the disaster and ruin that would follow a silver triumph . The fundamental idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Government will make silver worth $1.29 an ounce in gold . That and no other is the fundamental idea of Mr. Wca.corr 's amendment . Indeed , it assumes that the silver in the Treasury vaults is already worth $1.29 an ounce , and so treats it . The coining of the seigniorage is more vicious than the issue of greenbacks to the amount of forty-two millions , for that would involve no other evils than the use of the credit of the Government as a basis for currency and the inflation of the currency so based by that amount . The seigniorage certificates involve all that , and they involve besides the recognition of the theories of the Silver ? Party and the forcing of a profit balance of $42,000,000 out of a loss of $53,000,000 . Out of what Mr. HEWITT called the vacuum they make an asset and " coin " it . The war produces no such stress of need as to force the House to surrender to the Populistic Senate . They may keep the bill in conference until next year without crippling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President has the authority to issue bonds for the ' purchase of gold . Mr. CLEVELAND exercised that authority . Mr. McKim. = can exercise it . He can use the gold in the Treasury and when the stock is nearly exhausted replenish it by a bond issue . He is independent of Congress , if Congress seeks to force upon him abominations of doctrine which he renounced in 1896 by becoming the candidate of the opposition to BRYAN and free silver and the seigniorage . We hope Mr. DINGLEY and Mr. PAYNE , the Republican Oduse'conferrees , will res-sist this blackmailing attempt and that the House will back them .
