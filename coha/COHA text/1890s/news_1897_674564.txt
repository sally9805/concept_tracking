txt It is a pity that the stock gamblers in the Senate of the United States are not better equipped for their vocation as stock gamblers , as well as for their avocation as lawmakers . If they were , they would know that there are two sides to the market , and that money is to be made on the " short " side as well as on the " long . " When they go to the Senate , - many of them . are quite unfamiliar with any more recondite form of aleatory pursuit than that exemplified in the game of poker . Nay , some of them , being deacons and the like at home , are unfamiliar even - with that simple application of pyschology . The result is that when they " see channels " in which they " can be useful " to themselves , their vision is limited . They see . that their votes may enhance the , market price of certain securities . They buy the securities on a margin , and then go and vote to raise the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But : it leaves out a great part of the pleasure of stock gambling . That is in working the market in both directions . " . I will have nothing to do with real estate , " an experienced speculator once declared ; " there is no way of going short ' of it . " But there is a way of going-short of sugar , or of lead . Suppose the members of the Finance Committee or of the Conference Committee of the Senate , instead of " bulling sugar " by buying it and legislating for it , had " beared " it by selling it and legislating against it . There was just as much money to be made in that direction , and the gratitude of the people of - the United States would have been " thrown in , " if that is a consideration which has any weight with Senators . It is true that in that case they might not have found the same facility in securing a benevolent magnate to carry their stocks and . guarantee their accounts . But , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular nostril would be their reputation . The country would save a good deal of money if every Senator-elect were required to spend in a broker 's office the interval between his election and his qualification .
