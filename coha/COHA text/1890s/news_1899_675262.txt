txt One week ago there was discovered a case of smallpox in Everett . The patient was immediately taken off to the penthouse , down the harbor , the premises thoroughly disinfected and roped off , and the inmates quaranrined . The following day every inhabitant of Ward No. 1 was vaccinated . Yesterday , after a deliberation of four days , the Everett Board of Health arrived at the conclusion that every person in the city , 23,000 in all , should undergo vaccination within forty-eight hours and mailed each householder in the city a notice to that effect , stating that free vaccination could be had at the City Hall . YeSterday afternoon hundreds were turned away . Todity the city council chambers were turned into an emergency hospital .

At 2 o'clock the women had crowded against the door of the operating room . The doctors drove them back , but they packed up again to suffocation . Outside , the baby carriages multiplied and lined the street . The babies grew noisier , and finally , at 3 o'clock , it was found necessary to shut the doors and stop the rush . Even then , many who were inside got left . The lymph , 500 tubes of it , was exhausted ; so were the doctors . Most of the patients in the evening were men . The afternoon showed 494 names .
