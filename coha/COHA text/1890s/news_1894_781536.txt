txt The Parisian police raid upon the Anarchists seems to have been very well managed . The individual Anarchist may be hard to get , but the flourishing continuance of an Anarchist organization is a reproach to the police of any country in which it occurs . The raid of the Paris police will greatly discourage the French Anarchists . The Austrian Anarchists will be similarly discouraged if the project of law is enacted that bas been announced , to make the manufacture of dynamite a Government monopoly and to punish all those who infringe upon it . But , in fact , what is needed is not merely national but international legislation . A provision of law regulating the manufacture of dynamite in any country is comparatively ineffectual unless the same provision is enacted in other countries and unless the violation of itis made an extraditable offense by all the civilized powers . A treaty of extradition under which the Mosts and Ravachols and Vaillants and Frenches would be given np to the countries in which they had committed crimes would be a most wholesome and beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a monstrosity when it is extended so as to include rabid animals on four legs or on two . The healthy spirit of revolt against bossism and machine rule in Erie County does not seem to be all on the Democratic side . It was the Democrats that overthrew SrikuitAN and trampled upon him at the last electian , and the Repub:icans got the benefit of it in a strong delegation to the Legislature from that , end of the State . But this delegation appears to be desirous of having it understood that it ' will take no orders from " Boss " PLATT . In fact , the whole Erie County Republican organization is reported to be on the verge of revolt against PLATT and all his ways , and ready to lead an anti-machine movement for the control of the next State Convention . The people of this State in both parties are tired of submission to " bosses " and to the running of things by machine leaders , and they seem to be disposed to run things themselves or at least to have them run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-ready and ever-busy Kearsarge , which was hurried off some time ago to San Domingo , has already investigated the Azua affair , which seems to have resulted from a coincidence of mishaps and mistakes . 4n American trading schooner , the Henry Crosby , when near the port of Azna ; mistook the locality , and , not finding any customs officer coming out ' to board her , sent a boat toward the shore to make inquiries of a group of men observed there . It happened that at this very port Gen. CA3IPOS , the Governor of the province , had shortly before been assassinated , and that an insurrection had broken out . The boat hailed the group , which proved to be one of armed men , perhaps a patrol , and got a reply , but on turning about was fired at , and two of its three men were wounded . It can only be surmised that the boat was suspected of aiming to aid the fugitive assassin or the revolution , and that its turning about was viewed as an attempt to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mail , and meanwhile telegraphs that the firing was " a mistake . " No doubt President HEUREAUX will make the proper amends . As for the insurrection , it is already over and all is quiet .
