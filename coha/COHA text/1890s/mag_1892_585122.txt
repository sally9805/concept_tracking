txt WASHINGTON ALL5TON was an altogether unique figure among the earlier American painters , not only by the character of his performance , but by the high intellectual and imaginative quality which he brought to the study of his art . A particularly deep and strong admiration of him , of the kind which is commonly found to have its root in a vigorous and vital individuality , has long prevailed among those of an earlier generation who knew him ; and to anyone who looks into even the biographical material already accessible concerning him , this is easily explicable . His will be found to be , in other respects as well as in his relations to his art , a most interesting personality , in a time and surroundings in which these were not frequent . Among the chapters in recent biography which will remain long in their readers ' memory , are those in Mr. Adams 's " Life of Richard H. Dana , Jr. , " which describe Allston 's death , and incidentally give a glimpse of his ideals , methods , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nephew , Jared B. Flagg , soon to be published , will increase the means both for this estimate and for the definition of his stature and place among his contemporaries . The outer facts of his life , in so far as they need to be recalled for readers unfamiliar with them , are these : He was born at Waccamaw , S. C. , November 5 , 1779 , of mixed English and Huguenot descent ; showed an early liking and talent for painting ; and when sent to Newport to prepare for Harvard under a tutor , met there Malbone , the miniature painter ( whose pupil he afterward became ) , and others who confirmed his inclinations . He was graduated at Harvard in 1800 ; and a year later , having then finally determined to be a painter , he went to England with Malbone , studied as a pupil of the Royal Academy ( of which West , who befriended him , was then president ) , and spent the next seven or eight y ears there and in France and a , studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married a sister of William Ellery Channing , went back to Europe for another eight years ' stay , and in 1818 ( his wife having died several years before in London ) returned permanently to America . Just after his departure from London he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy . Till 1830 he lived in Boston ; in that year he married again ( a sister of Richard H. Dana , Sr. ) and removed to Cam-N From Michael Setting the Watch . Paradise Lost , Book IV . ( From a tracing in chalk on gauze , made by Aliston from a composition afterward destroyed. ) // bridgeport . During all these years his artistic activity was continuous , but varied ; greatest in London and in Rome , less productive after his return to Boston ; in his later years , in Cambridgeport , being chiefly restricted to a few great pictures , notably " Belshazzar 's Feast . " Leaving this picture still unfinished after years of work upon it , he died suddenly on July 9 , 1843 . Among his friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , were S. T. Coleridge , Benjamin West , C. R. Leslie , Sir George Beaumont , Sir Thomas Lawrence , William Collins , Wordsworth , and many more in England ; and among Americans , Channing , Dana , Irving , Guhan C. Verplanck , Gilbert Stuart , Vanderlyn , S. F. B. Morse , Greenough , Sully , Edward Everett , and , notwithstanding the retirement of his last years , many of the most prominent men of his time . From the letters , reminiscences , and other unpublished papers relating to Aliston , and to be included in his biography , a few extracts are here given . The most interesting portion of his life , in the light it throws upon his character , will probably always be that after his permanent return to America , when his powers were to a great degree recognized , but when he had entered on a phase very different from his prolific activity in London-concentrated upon a few large ideas and ambitions , living retired , contemplative , and absorbed with a few of the works which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written of him in this later aspect , that one is likely to forget how successful had been his part in a very active world , and how well-known and well-liked a figure he had been in London . Among the letters to and from him many glimpses may be had of his years there ; but from this correspondence only one or two passages are taken . One , from a letter to a friend , Fraser , a young artist in Charlestonwritten in a thoroughly boyish spirit , and with opinions which he no doubt afterward revised on some of the magnates of English art-dates from his ar-rivaL " LONDoN , August 25 , 1801 . " Were it in my power , I would certainly make an excuse for having so long delayed writing to you ; but , as I have none to make , I shall throw myself on that candor which my short acquaintance with you has encouraged me to expect . You have no doubt anticipated much , and will , I apprehend , be not a little disappointed at the account of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big with anticipation of every species of grandeur . No city , thought I then , to be compared with London , no people with its inhabitants . But I have found London but a city , and its inhabitants like the rest of the world , much in them to admire , more to despise , and still more to abhor . " As to the country , it is beyond my expectation , beautiful and picturesque ; and the appearance of the people , that of health and contentment ; in short , every leaf seemed to embody a sentiment and every cottage to contain a Venus . But when I arrived in London , what a contrast ! Figure to yourself the extremes of misery and splendor , and you will have a better idea of it than I can give you . Scarcely a luxury but you may command here ; and scarcely a scene of wretchedness but you may witness at the corner of every street . Indeed , the whole city appears to be composed of princes and beggars . I had no idea before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here no one has pride without fortune . Indeed , the most respectable among the middle ranks appear to have no consequence except in boasting of the acquaintance of someone in rank ; and among the greater part , so shameful is their venality , they will condescend to flatter the most infamous for a penny . " It is said in their defence that every man must live , and in so populous a country one must not be scrupulous about the means . But I can conceive of no necessity that should induce a man to degrade himself before those with whom he can not but feel an equality , and whom he has too frequently occasion to despise . But it is time to conclude with this , for I know you must be // impatient to read something about the that is a subordinate excellence . Inarts. deed , were it not , the English artists qwq purchased at a most exorbitant interest . " I have lately painted several pictures ; but am now about one that will far surpass anything I have done before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ looked upon Peter . ' It contains twenty figures , which are about two feet in height , on the whole making the best composition I ever attempted . The two principal groups are Christ between two soldiers , who are about to bear him away , the high priests , etc. , and Peter surrounded by his accusers . The other groups are composed of spectators , variously affected , men , women , and children . " Next week I shall apply for admission into the Academy . The very first figure that I drew from plaster , Mr. West said , would admit me . It was from the Gladiator . ' He was astonished when I told him it was my first , and . paid a compliment ( too pretty to be repeated ) to the correctness of my eye . He also observed that I not only preserved the form , but , what few artists think of , the expression of my subject . You see by this account that I am not very modest . Indeed I despise the affectation of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage you , by proving that much greater men than either you or I were once no better than ourselves . And could I convince you , by flattering myself , of the dignity of your powers , I would boast as much again . Believe me , sir , it is no proof of vanity that a man should suppose himself adequate to more than he has already performed . Confidence is the soul of genius . Great talents to a timid mind are of as little value to the owner as gold to a miser , who is afraid to use it . Great men rise but by their own exertions . It is the fool 's and the child 's pusillanimity alone that are boosted up to fame . How are we to learn our own powers without a trial ? Accident will , indeed , sometimes discover them ; but are we all to wait for accident ? No , sir ; the principle of self-love was implanted in us to excite emulation , and he violates a law of nature who yields to despair without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity is the best friend we can have . " Not that silly conceit founded on adventitious advantages , which exalts us but in our own imagination . But I mean the confidence which arises from a determination to excel , and is nourished by a hope of future greatness . The great Buffon thought there were but three geniuses in the world-two besides himself . And what was the consequence ? His application was indefatigable . He was a genius and ought to surpass other men . He did surpass them . Ca*sar , giving an account of his conquest , said Veni , vidi , vici . ' No man , perhaps , had so great an opinion of his own strength , and no man was capable of more . When a man is thus confident he is not to be discouraged by difficulties . But his exertions rather strengthen as they increase . It was a saying of Alcibiades , and I believe a very just one , that When souls of a certain order did not perform all they wished , it was because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , then , my friend , should you despair ? You have talents ; cultivate them  --  and it is not impossible that the name of Fraser may one daly be as celebrated as those of Raphael and Michael Angelo . Resolve to shine , and , believe me , the little crosses of to-day will vanish before the more substantial joys of to-morrow . " In the meantime let me advise you to beware of love . Love and painting are two opposite elements ; you can not live in both at the same time . Be wise in time , and let it not be said , when future biographers shall record your life , that Mr. Fraser promised much , his genius gave symptoms of expansion beyond mortality , but love , alas ! untimely love had set a seal upon his fame . His soul , which was just about to grasp a world , is now imprisoned within the bosom of a girL ' " Where now are those mighty schemes which were to elevate him to the summit of fame ? Where are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of time ? Alas ! a woman 's tears have washed them from his memory . No longer is he anxious to be distinguished from the // crowd ; no longer does the spirit of Michael Angelo point the way to heaven ; he is blessed with a smile from his mistress , his ambition is contented ; he seeks no other heaven than the bed of roses on her bosom . ' " No , Fraser , let this not be said of you . Love in its place I revere ; but it is not at all times to be indulged . There are many beautiful girls in Charleston , but Raphael and Michael Angelo are still more beautiful than they . " Believe me , with sincerity , " Your friend , " WASHINGTON ALLsToN . " The first of the two following letters from Coleridge , written on a journey to Italy , shows how early one of Allston 's strongest friendships had grown to an intimacy . The second , nine years later , was written just after Mrs. Allston 's death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my silence . Day after day I expected Mr. Wallis . Benvenati received me with almost insulting coldness , not even asking me to sit down , neither could I , by any inquiry , find that he ever returned my call ; and even in answer to a very polite note inquiring for letters , sent a verbal message that there was one , and I might call for it . However , within the last seven or eight days , he has called and made his amende honorable ; he says he forgot the name of my inn , and called at two or three in vain . Whoo ! I did not tell him that within five days I sent him a note in which the inn was mentioned , and that he sent me a message in consequence , and yet never called for ten days afterward . However , yester evening the truth came out . He had been bored by letters of recommendation , and , till he received a letter from Mr. Richardson , looked upon me as a bore-which , however , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more gentlemanly manner . Nothing more was necessary than the day after my arrival to have sent his card by his servant . But I forgive him from my heart .

" I have been dangerously ill for the last fortnight , and unwelLenough , heaven knows , previously ; but about ten days ago , on rising from my bed , I had a manifest stroke of palsy along my right side and right arm ; my head felt like another man 's head , so dead was it , that I seemed to know it only by my left hand and a strange sense of numbness .

To you , and you alone , since I have lert England , I have felt drawn , and had I not known the Wordsworths , should have esteemed and loved you first and most ; and as it is , next to them I love and honor you .

Even now it would not be too late , if the Spirit of Philosophy could be called down on Ministers and Governments . The true Policy is palpable and simple . A child , wearied out by undue exercise of parental authority , elopes , marries with an independent fortune , and sets up for himself .

Pray present him my best thanks for it . He has described your picture so well that I could almost copy it from the description . I heartily congratulate you on its success , and hope that it may prove a trusty pioneer for you to fame and fortune . The last , however , is only dreamt of by young painters ; a dream which becomes dimmer and dimmer as we advance in life . But no matter , the art itself has so much intrinsic pleasures for its votaries that we ought to be satisfied if to that is added but enough of the Mammon to make the ends of the year meet .

From Aliston to Leslie . " BOSTON , May 20 , 1821 . " DEAR LEsLIE : So many things must have been done in the Art since you last wrote , that I begin to feel not a little impatient for some account of them ; but as I have so long owed you a letter , I have no right to expect one from you till I pay my debts ; so I must e en , lazy as I am , write to you . " Of you and Newton I occasionally hear from such of our countrymen as have met you in London ; but they seldom give any distinct account of what either of you are doing ; of which , however , the newspapers sometimes speak , after their manner , with more credit of their own judgment than distinctness in their criticism . The last account which I have seen of you in the latter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year back . I am pleased to find that Newton 's last picture , The Importunate Author , ' from Molii*re , was so generally admired . I can have little notion of the picture , it being a branch of art he has engaged in since I left London . But from the variety of notices , and all favorable , which I have seen of it , I conclude it must have been generally liked by the artists , from whom the newspaper critics , especially when they agree in praising , always take their tone . By the by , have you seen a criticism on Haydon 's Entrance of our Saviour into Jerusalem , ' in an article on the State of the Arts in England , ' in a late number of the Edinburgh Review ? The praise it gives , I think just , but can not say the same of all the censure ; one point , however , in the latter seems well founded  --  the want of those subtle niceties and inflections in the outlines which make so great a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what I always felt the want of in nearly all the pictures of modern date . With respect to the rest of the review , it is but little better than a gross libel on the English schooL The speculations of the writer seem to be those of a man who , in hunting after originality , runs down a common thought till it falls to pieces , then putting it again together , and by stitching on the head where the tail was , is astonished to find what an // extraordinary animal he has been chasing . It is a dangerous thing for a writer to think of his own cleverness when he is engaged in the cause of truth ; the interest of the cause is too apt to become subordinate to the &amp;lat of the pleader 's wit . " But it is time that I say something of myself . Various circumstances have prevented me from recommencing with Belshazzar ' till last September , since which I have , with one interruption , been constantly at work on it . On seeing it at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got my point of distance too near , and the point of sight too high . It was a sore task to change the perspective in so large a picture ; but I had the courage to do it , and by lowering the latter and increasing the former I find the effect increased a hundredfold . I have spared no labor to get everything that came within the laws of perspective correct , even the very banisters in the gallery are put in by rule . Now it is over I do not regret the toil , for it has given me a deeper knowledge of perspective than I ever had before , for I could not do that and many other things in the picture , which are seen from below , without pretty hard fagging at the Jesuit . ' * I have , besides , made several changes in the composition , which are for the better , such as introducing two enormous flights of steps , beyond the table , leading up to an inner apartment . These steps are supposed to extend wholly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , which being just discoverable in the dark , have a powerful effect on the imagination . I suppose them to be principally Jews , exulting in the overthrow of the idols and their own restoration , as prophesied by Jeremiah , Isaiah , and others , which I think their action sufficiently explains . The gallery , too , is also crowded , the figures there foreshorthened as they would appear seen from below . " I have written to Collins by this opportunity , and given him a list of what I have done since I have been here . Among the pictures mentioned I consider Jeremiah ' and Miriam A standard work on perspective . the Prophetess ' the best I have done here : the last , I think , is one of the best I have ever painted , in the back of which is seen the shore of the Red Sea , and on it the wreck of Pharaoh 's army .

" In 1830 , when Allston was already settled in Cambridgeport , and was devoting himself almost exclusively to his " Belshazzar , " a correspondence with Gulian C. Verplauck took place , which sought to draw his art into public service , and called out some characteristic letters . Verplanek , who was a man of letters and a conspicuous figure in public life , was chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings of the House of Representatives . From Verplanclc to B. H. Dana . " WASHINGTON , February 17 , 1830 . " My DEAR SIR : I have this moment written to Aliston about a picture for our public buildings from his hand , which , as chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings , I hope to be able to get ordered by Congress and passed in our general bill for the buildings , etc. , without any flourish , or limiting him to any subject of the day . I hope he will answer me without delay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " Before I leave Congress I trust to do the state some service by reducing the magnificent uselessness of our hail , and leaving it to my successors in a state where common - sense can be spoken and heard , and where a shrill voice or else the lungs of a stentor will not be the chief requisites of a congressional orator . In other words , I am very busy in studying both the theory and practice of acoustics for the purpose of improving the hall , and I am convinced that such a reform would do // more for the legislature , as well as its taste and eloquence , than any law or constitutional amendment . I feel that I can not fill my sheet with anything worth reading , and having begun with the benevolent intention of making you act as Allston 's flapper according to the Laputan usage , must end by again urging upon you that duty . " Yours truly , " G. C. VERPLANcK . " From Aliston to lferplanclc . " CAMBRIDGEPORT , MASS. , March 1 , 1830 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your letter of the 17th ult. until the night before last ( Saturday ) , and I shall endeavor , agreeably to your wishes , to answer it in a business-like manner . Though I have , I fear , but little of that laconic spirit , so essential to it , which I used so much to admire in our excellent friend , S. Williams , of Finsbury Square . Without more flourish , then , you could not desire to be more heartily thanked than I thank you for this additional instance of the friendship with which you honor me . These are not words of courtesy , but of grateful truth , and yet I fear there are certain formidable , and to my present apprehension , insurmountable , obstacles to my profiting by your kindness . The subjects from which I am to choose , you say , are limited to American History . The most prominent of these , indeed the only ones that occur to me , are in our military and naval achievements . Herein lies my difficulty . I will not say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent for battle pieces ; and , perhaps , because they have always appeared to me , from their very nature , incapable of being justly represented ; for to say nothing of the ominous prelude of silent emotion , when you take away the excessive movement , the dash of arms , the deadly roll of the drum , the blast of the trumpet , forcing almost a heart into a coward , the rush of cavalry , the thunder of artillery , and the still more fearful din of human thunder , giving a terrific life to the whole - and all this must be taken from the painter-what is there left for his canvas ? It seems to me ( at least in comparison with the living whole ) caput mortuum . All these things , and indeed much more , can be made present to the imagination by words . In this the poet and historian have the advantage of the painter . I know not where , even among the great names of my art , to look for anything like the living mass of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with these subjects , such as monotony of color , of costume , of form , together with a smallness of parts ( ever fatal to breadth and grandeur ) , that make them , at least to me , wholly untranslatable in the painter 's language . The monotony of color alone would paralyze my hand . Such being my opinion , you will easily believe that I could have no hope of succeeding in subjects of this nature . Indeed , I know from past experience that I must fail when the subject is not of myself , that is , in relation to the powers of my art , essentially exciting . In a pecuniary view , it has been perhaps my misfortune to have inherited a patrimony ; since it has lasted only just long enough to allow my mind to take its own course , till its habits of thought had become rigid and too fixed to be changed when change was desirable . To be more intelligible , having in the commencement of my art and for the greater part of my subsequent life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I of course engaged in nothing which had not that for its chief end , the realizing of my conceptions being my chief reward ; for though the pecuniary profit was always an acceptable contingency , it was never at that time an exciting cause ; so far from it , that I have in some instances undertaken works for less than I knew they would cost . As an artist , I can not , in spite of many troubles , regret this freedom of action , since I feel of such that I owe to it whatever professional skill I may possess . But of late years , since the source of this liberty has been dried up , and the cold current of necessity has sprung up in its stead , I have sometimes , as a man , almost felt the possession to have been a misfortune , for necessity I find has no inspiration ; she has not with me even the forcing power . Willingly , most willingly , would I have been driven by her , but it // seems that at my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed in its own peculiar orbit to be moved by anything extrinsic . In other words , it seems to me almost morally impossible to compose , much less to finish , a picture where the subject does not afford pleasurable excitement . I trust you know me too well to doubt my patriotism because I can not be inspired to paint an American battle . I yield in love of country to no man ; no one has gloried more in the success of her arms , or more sincerely honored the gallant spirits whose victories have given her a name among nations . But they need not my pencil to make their deeds known to posterity . Could I embody them as they deserve , or even make others feel what I have felt , as the fame of them came to me across the water , while I was in kind , hospitable old England ( for such , even while a foe to my country , she ever was to me ) ; could I send that hearty breeze from our gallant native land to their hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would invest them with the grandeur of my art , or touch them not . But the power is not mine . I know you will not doubt the sincerity of this conviction , but you will better estimate the strength of it when I add , that at no time would the commission you propose be more acceptable to me in a pecuniary view than at present . " But may there not be some eligible subject in our civil history ? For myself Ican think of none that would make a picture ; of none , at least , that belongs to high art . But such a subject might possibly have occurred to you . If so , and I find it one from which I can make such a picture as you would have me paint , both for my own credit and that of the nation , be assured I will most gladly undertake it . I am persuaded , however , that you will agree with me in this , that no consideration of interest should induce me to accept any commission from the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My best indeed may be all unworthy , but less than that my country shall not have . In the meantime , that is , till a practicable subject is found , I must beg you to suspend , if such is in progress , the order for a picture . ' You will readily appreciate the motive for this request ; namely , to avoid the censure which the good-natured world are ever too disposed to bestow on all those who seem wanting to their own interests . I know the world too well not to foresee that it would do me essential injury were it known that I declined such a commission . They would not understand the impracticability I have stated , were they even made acquainted with it . Neither would they believe how grievous to me was the necessity of declining it . " There is another class of subject , however , in which , were I permitted to choose from it , I should find exciting matter enough , and more than enough , for my imperfect skill-that is , from Scripture . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should it be ? This is a Christian land , and the Scriptures belong to no country , but to man . The facts they record come home to all men , to the high and the low , the wise and simple ; but I need not enlarge on this topic to you . Should the Government allow me to select a subject from them , I need not say with what delight I should accept the commission . With such a source of inspiration and the glory of painting for my country , if there be anything in me , it must come out . Would it might be so I But let us suppose it-well , supposing such a commission given , there 's a subject already composed in petto , which I have long intended to paint as soon as I am at liberty : the three Marys at the tomb of the Saviour , the angel sitting on a stone before the mouth of the sepub chre . I consider this one of my happiest conceptions . The terrible beauty of the angel , his preternatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bewilderment of the three women , the streak of distant daybreak lighting the City of Jerusalem out of the darkness , and the deep-toned spell of the chiarooscuro , mingling as it were the night with the day , I see now before me ; I wish I could see them on the walls at Washington . " Now as to the price , should such a dream , I will not call it hope , be realized , it would be eight thousand dollars , which I believe was the price given // to Colonel Trumbull for each of his pictures . I should not indeed refuse ten thousand , should Uncle Sam take the generous fit upon him to offer it , but eight is my price for that particular composition , which would consist of four figures , seven feet high ; the picture itself ( an upright ) twelve or thirteen feet high and ten or twelve wide . Were I to undertake a larger composition from another subject , and of the dimensions of Colonel Trumbull 's , which I think are eighteen by twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I fear this last sum would frighten some of your grave members ; my conscience would , however , be quite safe in making the demand , were it even more . And I think I have already given the world sufficient proof that I am not mercenary . " Pray do not let any part of this letter get into print .. I beg you will not think from anything I have said , that I intend any disrespect to the painters of battles , or that I would under-rate such pictures . I meant only to express my own peculiar notions of them , as picturable subjects , quoad , myself . There are many of deserved reputation , which show great skill in their authors ; and among those of modern date , it would be unjust not to mention , as holding the very first rank , Mr. West 's Wolf ' and the Death of Warren and Montgomery , ' and the Sortie ' by Colonel Trumbull .

" My IDEAR Sm : Your letter only convinces me the more that we must , if we can , have one specimen of high art ' on the wall of the CapitoL By American history , mere revolutionary history is not meant . To Scripture , I fear we can not go in the present state of public opinion and taste . But does our anterevolutionary history present no subject ? The landing of the pilgrims , a threadbare subject in some respects , has never been viewed with a poet 's and painter 's eye . What think you of that , or of any similar subject in our early history ? Your townsman , Dr. Holmes , has recently published a very useful , though not important , book of Annals . ' A hasty glance over the first volume of this would perhaps suggest some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilgrims . I have read your letter to Colonel Drayton , who fully agrees with me in honoring your feeling upon this subject , and still wishes to call upon your services in embellishing our national annals . Emulating our friend Williams , not from choice , but from the wish not to lose the mail , I will not turn over the leaf . " Yours truly , " G. C. VERPLANCK . " From Allston to Verplancle . " CAMBRIDGEPORT , March 29 , 1830 . " My DEAR Six : Your two letters of the ninth and twelfth have , as the business phrase is , duly come to hand ; as you full well know that I can not be insensible to such persevering kindness , I will not trouble you with a repetition of thanks , but proceed to answer them in as business-like a way as I can . " To the first subject you propose , The Landing of the Pilgrims ' ( not unpicturesque ) , I have a personal objection . It has already been painted by an old friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom I would on no account give pain ; which I could not avoid doing were I to encroach on what , at the expense of several years labor , he has a fair right to consider as his ground . I do not like rivalry in any shape ; and my picture on the same subject would seem like it . Indeed , it would give me no pleasure to beat anyone . Nor do I consider this business of beating ' as having any natural connection with excellence of any kind , which to be such must be intrinsic and independent of comparison . Nature never made two minds alike ; and if the artist , whether poet or painter , has any of the mens divinior with the power of embodying it , his production must have &amp; distinctive excellence , // which not a hundred bad or good ones by another can either increase or diminish . I know this is not the doctrine of the Reviewing age , but I believe it to be true , nevertheless . Moreover , I doubt if competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the love of excellence in the abstract , and for itself , that alone can produce excellence . And I believe that Raffaelle loved Michael Angelo because he thought him his superior , for that excellen7ce which he could not reach himself . There may indeed be clever imitations , got up under more ignoble impulses , a kind of second-hand originality , as Edmund Dana calls them , that might pass for it ; nay , the world is full of them , mocking each other , and sometimes mocking at , and how bitterly-But here I am wandering off , like Tangent in the play , I hardly know where . After this excursion I will not trouble you with my objections to the other subject , the Leave-taking of Washington , ' lest I have no room for one of my own choosing , which I should be glad to have you approve , namely : The First Interview of Columbus with Ferdinand and Isabella , ' at court after the discovery of America , accompanied by natives , and so forth , exhibited in evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book it is unnecessary for me to describe the scene . Here is magnificence , emotion , and everything , the very triumph of matter ' to task a painter 's powers . The announcement and the proof of the birth of a new world . This is not thought of now for the first time . I have long cherished it as one of the dreams which the future , if the future were spared me , was one day to embody . But to business ; the size of a picture from this would be not less than eighteen feet by twelve , perhaps twenty by fourteen ; and the price fifteen thousand dollars . As to its class , I know not what subject could be said more emphatically to belong to America , and her history , than the triumph of her discoverer . We , who now enjoy the blessing of his discovery , can not place him too high in that history which without him would never have been . Besides , the beautiful work of Irving has placed him as the presiding genius over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal , fountain of our national literature ; the fame of which Columbus was so long defrauded is now restored to him , and it will endure , at least with every American heart . Pray excuse my heroics , I did not mean to get into them . May I venture to suggest one popular hint . The subject is from an American book , and a book , too , that any country might be proud of . Now I am going to take a liberty , for which I feel assured you will not require any apology . Could not a commission also be given to my friend Yanderlyn ? He is truly a man of genius , who has powers , if opportunity is given to call them forth , that would do honor to his country . His Anadne ' has no superior in modern art ; his Marius ' also , though not equal to that , is still a noble work . Some persons have unjustly censured him for not having painted many such pictures . The wonder to me is how , circumstanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could have attained to the knowledge and power in the art which those works show him to possess . For , I say it not in friendship , but in simple justice , Yanderlyn is a great artist . I have known him for many years , in France and Italy , intimately , and I never knew the time when he had not literally to struggle with poverty ; the process of procuring his daily bread stifling powers that , if allowed freely to act , would have filled Europe with his name . I fear that like the subject of my last letter , he finds no inspiration in necessity . Let his country now call his genius forth , I know he will do her honor . With this opinion of him , I need hardly say that my own commission would be doubly welcome , should I hear at the same time that an equal commission was also given to Vanderlyn . And if Uncle Sam 's generous mood would incline him , too , to commission Morse and Sully , I should then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own , and you know what I think of him . The quickening atmosphere which he is now breathing in Europe , will open some original and powerful seeds which I long ago saw in him . I am much mistaken if he has not that in him which will one day surprise . And Sully has historical powers , already // ( Facsimile of a pen and ink drawing by Aliston , from his painting. ) proved in his Crossing the Delaware , ' of no common order . " I am much gratified to learn the interest which Colonel Drayton does rile the honor to take in my behalf . I knew him some years since in London , and I have met few persons with whom I have been so much pleased on so short an acquaintance . Pray present him my respects and thanks . Should the commission be given I hope they will not limit me as to time , as I have several engagements that must previously be fulfilled . My interest would , of course , preclude any unnecessary delay . " Faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house " owing to a pressure of other business , " and the whole matter lapsed for several years . In 1836 , however , the measure , never entirely dropped , was carried through ; and a new correspondence , this time with Mr. Jarvis , of the committee , shows that in the interval he had incurred an obligation to finish his " Belshazzar , " which weighed upon him to an almost morbid degree , and was now the leading motive of his refusal of an offer which , especially coupled with his need of money , must VOL . XL-8 have presented great temptations to his mind . Apart from Allston 's own ambition to finish his great picture , it was to be paid for by a subscription of $1,000 each from ten gentlemen , and a part of the money had been already advanced . " GAMBRIDGEPORT , June 24 , 1836 . " DEAR JArivls : I have just received your letter of the eighteenth inst. , informing me of the passage of a bill by Congress for supplying the vacant panels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention in my behalf , I beg you to accept my best thanks ; but I regret to say , that under present circumstances it is not in my power to profit by them . I had anticipated this contingency , and had long since deliberately made up my mind on the subject . I am not a free man , nor shall I probably become one in less than three years ; for after the completion of Belshazzar ' ( which I expect to resume in a few weeks ) I have several other pictures engaged , which I am bound in honor to finish before I undertake any new work . An expected picture at an uncertain time is an incubus to my imagination ; I have therefore , under this feeling , declined five Figures from Jacob 's Dream . // commissions within the last eighteen months . Could you know but the twentieth part of what I have suffered from the ( compelled ) delay of Belshazzar , ' you would readily believe that my peace of mind requires me to withstand to do . Even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . I do not , however , believe there was any ill-nature in this ; but words , if unjust , may be hard without ill-nature . I never quitted Beishazzar ' at any time the present temptation , for temptation it certainly is ; but he is safe who knows when he is tempted , seeing the end in the beginning . Were I free from my imperative engagements , nothing would delight me more than to fill one of the panels of the Rotunda . It has often been a pleasant dream to me ; but I am not my own master and must dismiss all such dreams . " I would not recall , much less repeat , the many injurious speeches that have been made about me for not finishing this picture , though it was a private affair , with which the public had nothing but when compelled to do so by debts contracted while engaged upon it , and which I could discharge only by painting small pictures ; many of which , from being forced work , cost me treble the labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a pittance of profit-nay , some hardly enough to cover their expenses , and of course without the means of returning to the larger work . You know that I have been unremitting in my labors . For years the Sabbath was the only time that I have been absent ( except on business ) from my painting - room , and I Figures from " Jacobs Dream . ' // never sit there with my arms folded . That I have not brought more to pass was because I was like a bee trying to make honey in a coal-hole . But , thanks to some noble - hearted friends , those dark days are now past . They have taken me out of the squirrel cage ; my foot no longer falls in the same place , but every step I take carries me onward . By the assistance of these friends , my mind is now at ease ; but it would not long continue so were I to accept the commission which your friendship has so kindly labored to procure me . If in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibility , they can hardly be expected to be more considerate when every man in the country might claim to be a party . Will he never finish that picture for Government ? ' might be asked from Castine to St. Louis . No money would buy off the fiends that such would conjure up . I am now an old man , and am besides too infirm of body to bear these things as some might ; they would soon wear away the little flesh I have . A regard for my peace therefore will compel me to decline the Government commission , should it be offered me . " But I must wind up this long epistle by again expressing my grateful thanks for your kindness , which I trust you know I most sincerely feel , though for the reasons assigned I can not avail myself of it as you had hoped . That it might not be thought ( from ignorance of my motives ) that I had carelessly thrown fortune from me , ' I wish you to show this letter in confidence to Mr. Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aliston. friend , what I could not have written to him , and it will save me the awkwardness of a more formal exposition of the reasons for declining the honor which the committee would confer on me .
