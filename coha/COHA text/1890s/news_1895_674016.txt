txt The German-American voters of New -- Yolk City have become a pretty numerous and substantial party . On the issue of chief interest to themselves they determined the result of the election . Being possessed of an issue , they ought to have a policy . We can suggest one . The law-making power of the State 3s absolutely in the hands of the Republicans . They have the power , and with it the responsibility of action or inaction on any project of legislation that may be suggested ; and they must take the consequences . The section of our new Republican Constitution that prohibits bookmaking also guarantees the right of petition . The thirty or forty thousand German-American citizens whose votes made the majority on Tuesday should appear before the Legislature shortly after the 1st of January by petition It ought to be a petition of impressive brevity in its prayer , but of memorable heft and numbers in its signing . A grant of power for local self-government within specified limits is all that need be asked for  --  the privilege of the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be modified to suit their habits and their sense of right . The Republican Legislature and the Republican Governor must either grant or deny such a petition . It would fall in a political year when Republican politicians , and especially Republicans of Presidential imaginings , will be most polite to all large groups of voters and painfully wary of denying safe requests . But is the Sunday question sale ? That is a problem that the Republican law-making powers will not be called upon to solve unless our German friends force it upon their attention . The question is tremendously live . It ca n't be burked . The Republicans must have some policy ; they must be either men or mice . Make them speak out .
