txt While there is the greatest activity shown in the close Congressional districts , notably in those of Major and ex-Gov . Foster , the real storm centre of political factions will be situated next week in and about the capital of the State . The novelty of a special session under any circumstances ? would attract great attention , but when the iSovernor has been compelled to eonvene the Legislature for the single purpose of ousting from office men who are alleged to be corrupt , and regarding one of whom he has publicly expressed the opinion that he was dishonest , it naturally excites the greatest interest andsensaLionel rumors as to what will be develtped . The Democrats have a good working majority in both branches of the Legislature , and , if united , could sustain the Governor by at once repealing the law under which the appointments were made . Unfortunately for the Democracy , nearly every member of the Hamilton County delegation is friendly to the ** Board of Public Improvements . if the law la repealed and the board abolished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President , is the man who Gov . Campbell says is dishonest . The friends of the board are exceedingly anxious to gain friends and defeat the object of the session . Last Winter the Democrats reorganized several of the cities by ousting Republicans and placing them under the control of boards of their own political complexion . Dayton , Hamilton . and Columbus were among the number , and to hold the members from these ( Mies solid In their opposition to the Governor they threaten that in the . event they vote with the Republicans to abolish the Cincinnati board , they , too , will form a combination and abolish every board that was given birth last Winter . It is this threat on the part of the Hamilton County members that complicates the work after the session convenes , and will lead to something of the sensational nature . There is no question as to Gov . Campbell 's expectations of being supported by the Republicans and enough of his own party to bring about a repeal of the law and the enactment of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell is very cool and carries himself as one fully determined to rid himself of all compromising alliances . He feels confident of his position , but just what evidence he has against President Reemelin and two other Democratic members of the Cincinnati Board no one can find out . quite a number of Democratic politicians arrived to-night , among whom are a small sprinkling of members . All are at sea as to what will transpire on Tuesday , when the Legislature is to convene in special Session . A tremendous pressure is being brought to bear to induce Mr. Reemelin , the President of the Cincinnati Board , to resign , two others having consented to follow him . If this can be brought about by noon tomorrow , the Governor has intimated that he will revoke the proclamation , appoint three others to till the vacancies , and then allow the Legislature in its regular session to give Cincinnati an entirely new charter . The board furnishes work for over 2,000 employee , and it is argued that if Reemelln holds outevery one will be ousted under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati for two days working to bring about a compromise , hoping to save the State ticket and the Congressman , if such a thing , is possible , Mr. Brine is expected here to-morrow to aid in the labors of love and harmony . Gov . Campbell , referring to the indorsement given Mr. Reemelin by the CineinnAti Executive Committee , said : These gentlemeh have made it very hard for decent men to support the ticket there with any enthusiasm . They have slaughs tered Ottie Cosgrove , who could easily have been elected , and thus have added one Republican to the next Congress . " The Governor , when asked if it were not possible that the Legislature might appoint a committee to investigate such charges as might be made against the board , replied in the affirmative , but added , " The strong probability is that the Democratic Party would not recover from the exposure during my lifetime or yours ; that is to say , if the Democratic Party through its boards in the General Assembly proposed to become the apologist and defender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature fails to adopt your recommendation 1 " " I do not consider that probable , certainly not unless the Republican members are recreant . My proposition is merely to restore to the people that of which this General Assembly deprived them . If this be not done  --  more than that , if they do not pass such legislation under suspension of the rules with alacrity and avidity ? there will not be enough left of the Democratic Party to pay for counting In November . If the Legislature sits two days , it may , so far as I am concerned , sit all the rest of my term . It can make the matter no worse by sitting here all the time after that The moral effect of legislating this board out , if it be done speedily , will be incalculable , and the Democrats will sweep the State , but if they are going at it in the spirit of a man who is going to have a tooth pulled , and put it off until the last minute and a make weary face when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is and adjourn . " FALSE PROMISES ABOUT WAGES . AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE EVIL EFFECTS OF THE at'KINLEY LAW . An illustration of the pernicious effects of the MoKinley high protective tariff law upon the interests of workingmen was given yesterday at the meeting of the Central Labor Federation . A committee came from the silk ribbon weavers of Paterson , N. J. The members said that while the tariff law was still a bill in Congress the working people in Paterson were told that if it should become a law the wages of working people would be increased , and people would witness a new era of glorious prosperity all over the land . Trade would revive and everybody would be happy . But instead of " a new era of glorious prosperity " the contrary seemed to be the rule . For since the bill became a law the wages of the silk ribbon weavers have been reduced 25 per cent . and the operatives are out on strike to resist the reduction .
