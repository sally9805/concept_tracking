txt The first meeting of the delegates to the grand convention of railway employes was held yesterday morning , in the Lenox Lyceum . The convention is to hold a three days ' session . The purpose of the gathering , which is notable as being the largest of its kind ever held in this country , is to impress upon all members of the various organizations the necessity of a higher education , to discuss the question of a closer unity among the laboring masses , as to how their conditions can be bettered , and to seek a way to a better representation of the grand army of workers in legislative halls . Nearly 2,000 delegates are expected to attend the convention , but not more than a third of that number had arrived yesterday . The delegates come from all parts of the United States and from Canada and Mexico . The orders represented are the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers , the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen , the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen , the Order of Railway Telegraphers. the Switchmen 's Mutual Aid Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railway Car Inspectors . The delegates were slow in coming together yesterday morning , and , although the hour set for calling the convention to order was 10 o'clock , it was not until more than an hour later that the work of the convention began . The main hall of the Lyceum had been prepared for the meeting . Around the circular walls of the hall were hung hard-wood panels bearing the arms of each State of the Union . Across the stage was draped a huge flag of the United States . The convention was called to order by C. F. Weisz of the Order of Railway Car Conductors , and who had been appointed Chairman of the Executive Committee . Among those who were on the platform were E. E. Clark , Chief of the Order of Railway Conductors : Frank Arnold , Secretary of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen ; Charles F. Wilkens . Assistant Grand Conductor of the Order of Railway Car Conductors ; E. E. Greely , Assistant Grand Secretary of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen ; P. H. Morrissey . Assistant Grand Master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chaplain of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen . The address of welcome was delivered by State Senator T. C. O'Sullivan . In reply to it , Mr. Morrissey said that the time had come to renounce the old trades union methods so long in use and to make the fight for their rights and liberties in the Legislatures of the States and in the halls of Congress . Legislation , he said , was needed more than arbitration . " We , as railroad men , " the speaker added , " stand to-day as a bulwark against the advancing wave of Anarchy that is sweeping over this country . We are lawabiding citizens , but the time has come when we must make the laws as bell as abide by them when they are made . " P. F. Doyle of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and who is a member of the State Board of Arbitration said that he wanted to read a bill which he had succeeded in getting into the statute books of New-Jersey . It was a bill imposing a fine of $500 on any person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any association or brotherhood as a condition of retaining employment . Mr. Morrissey remarked that the law was not worth the paper upon which it was printed , so long as it was operative in one State only . It would be easy , he said , for any road , the Pennsylvania , for instance , to employ all its men either in New-York or Pennsylvania , and then send them into New-Jersey to work . Mr. Morrissey said that in his opinion it would be wise to appoint a committee in each State of the Union to watch the Legislature . There should also be a standing committee at Washington to look after the Government of the United States . To illustrate this he told of a pernicious , though innocent-looking bill that nearly became a law , and would have , too , had it not been for the vigilance of the newspaper correspondents , who had detected the flaw . The bill in question made it a felony to willfully delay or interfere with the progress of any train carrying passengers or the United States mails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbers and men of that ilk , but in Mr. Morrissey 's opinion it applied to those who tied up trains oy striking . With the close of Mr. Morrissey 's address the convention went into executive session . It was expected that the public meeting which was held last night would be largely attended . The expectation was not realized , not more than two or three hundred people being present . This was caused , the speakers of the evening explained , by a misapprehension as to the purpose of the meeting . The delegates who are in the city did not attend it , as no business was to be transacted. and a report which had gone out that the meeting was to be a secret one prevented outsiders from going . E. E. Clark , who was the first speaker of the evening , said that history had repeated itself . The first victory for organized labor , he said , was won by the children of Israel centuries ago . To-day , he declared , we have with us the master still in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . Selfishness , with which all are imbued , makes the capitalistic trust more cohesive , and has an opposite effect upon the labor trust . General Master Sargent made a stirring address and was frequently applauded . " This is no time , " he said , " for an aristocracy of labor . Never was there a period when there was a greater necessity for firm organization of the laboring masses . This is one of the greatest countries the sun shines on . If I say this Nation has been a prosperous one , who can deny it ? We have had no famine , no pestilence ; we have had plenty of the products of the earth , and to-day there . is within the confines of this country as much money as any other can show . " And yet , " said the speaker , after an impressive pause . " starvation is in our midst . Thousands of half-starved , halfclothed men are wandering about this country begging for work . Call them what you may , call them ' hobos , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men  --  men out of work and who ca n't find work . " Now , I ask you if there is not something grievously wrong when such a state of affairs can exist ? There is somebody responsible for it , and some day there will be a reckoning , either here or above . " Is there a remedy ? My ' friends , there Dever was yet an evil that did not have a remedy . That remedy does not lie in Anarchy , nor in rebellion ; it lies in a higher education of ourselves and in the united efforts of the honest workingmen of this country . " The time has come when the working people of this country will have to look out for their own interests , and not trust to others . " The speaker pa-id his respects to politicians , and in conclusion said that the experience of the last eighteen months had opened the eyes of the working people . The real work of the convention will begin this morning at 10 o'clock . Mr. to Visit Navy Yard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the St. Denis Hotel , and who spoke to naval veterans in Brooklyn yesterday , will visit the-Brooklyn Navy Ta-d to-day , and  - -  inspect the docks and several other parts of the Government property there He will be the guest of Admiral Ghemrdi at luncheon , and will return to Washington this evening .
