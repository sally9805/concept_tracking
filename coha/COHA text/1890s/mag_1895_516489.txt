T EGUCIGALPA is the odd name of the capital of the republic of Honduras , the least advanced of the republics of Central or South America . Somerset had learned that there were no means of getting to this capital from either the Pacific Ocean on one side or from the Caribbean Sea on the other except on muleback , and we argued that while there were many mining - camps and tailitary outposts and ranches situated a nine days ' ride from civilization . capitals at such a distance were rare , and for that reason might prove entertaining . Capitals at the months of great rivers and at the junction of many railway systems we knew , but a capital hidden away behind almost inaccessible m oun tairi s , like a monastery of the Greek Church , we had never seen . A door-mat in the front hall of a house is useful , and may even be ornamental , though it is never interesting ; but if the door-mat be hidden away in the third-story back room it instantly assumes an importance and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of usefulness . Our ideas as to the characteristics of Honduras were very vague , and it is possible that we might never have seen Te gucigalpa had it not been for Colonel Charles Jeffs , whom we found apparently waiting for us at Puerto Cortez , and who we still believe had been stationed there by some guardian spirit to guide us in safety across the continent . Colonel Jeffs is a young American mining engineer from Minneapolis , and has lived in Honduras for the past eleven years . Some time ago lie assisted Bogran , when that general was President , in one of the revolutions against him , and was made a colonel in consequence . So we called him our military attachd , and Griscom our naval attache , because he was an officer of the Naval Brigade of Pennsylvania . Griscom had joined us in New York three days before we sailed , and Jeffs we found at Puerto Cortez . It was there that he first made himself known to us by telling our porters they had no right to rob us merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . He made us understand at the same time that it was as gringos , or foreigners , we were thereafter to be designated and disliked . We had no agreement with Jeffs , nor even what might be called an understanding . He had , as I have said , been intended by providence to convey us across Honduras , By ? j*ICHA ? j*D flA7j*DI*G 1247'IS // and every one concerned in the outfit The railroad journey from Puerto Corseemed to accept that act of kindly fate tez to San Pedro Sula lasts four hours , without question .

About thirty years hire the mules . " And so it was settled , ago an interoceanic railroad was projectand we went off to get our things out of the custom-house with a sense of perfect onfidence in our new acquaintance and of delightful freedom from all responsibility . And though , perhaps , it is not always best to put the entire charge of an excursion through an unknown country into the hands of the first kindly stranger whom you see sitting on a hotel porch landing , we found that it worked admirably , and we depended on our military attache so completely that we never pulled a cinch-strap or interviewed an ex-Presi*lent without asking his permission first . I wish every traveller as kindly a guide and as good a friend . The train to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three little cars , with no glass in the windows , and with seats too wide for one person , and not at all large enough for two . The natives made a great expedition of this journey , and piled the cramped seats with bananas and tortillas and old bottles filled with drinking-water . We carried no luncheons ourselves , but we had the greater advantage of them in that we were enjoying for the first time the most eantiful stretch of tropical swamp land and jungle that we came across during our entire trip through Honduras . Some- 5OMER5ET. times the train moved through tunnels of palms as straight and as regular as qwq The grades are in some places very steep , and as the engine was not as young as it had been , two negro boys and a box of sand were placed on the cow-catcher , and whenever the necessity of stopping the train was immediate , or when it was going down hill too quickly , they would lean forward and pour this sand on the rails . As soon , as Griscom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up their places to them , and after the first station we all sat for the remainder of the journey on the cow-catcher . It was a beautiful and exhilarating ride , and suggested tobogganing , or those thrilling little railroads on trestles at Coney Island and at the fetes around Paris . It was even more interesting , because we could see each rusty rail rise as the wheel touched its nearer end as though it meant to fly up in our faces , and when the wheel was too quick for it and forced it down again , it contented itself by spreading out half a foot or so to one side , which was most alarming . But the interest rose even higher at times when a stray steer would appear on the rails at the end of the tunnel of palms , as at the end of a telescope , and we saw it OUR MILITARY ATTAcHI*. growing rapidly larger and larger as the train swept down upon it . It always lurched off to one side before any one was killed , but not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles , and , on our part , some inward debate as to whether we bad better jump and abandon the train to its fate , or die at our post with our hands full of sand . We lay idly at San Pedro Sula for four days , while Jeffs hurried about collecting mules and provisions . When we arrived we had insisted on setting forth that same evening , but the place put its spell upon us gently but firnily , and when we awoke on the third day and found we were no nearer to starting than at the moment of our arrival , Jeffs ' perplexities began to be something of a bore , an.d we told him to put things off to the morrow , as did every one else . San Pedro Sula lay in peaceful isolation in a sunny valley at the base of great mountains , and from the upper porch of our hotel , that had been built when the railroad was expected to continue on across the continent , we could see above the palms in the garden the clouds moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifts of snow in the hollows between . We used to sit for hours on this porch in absolute idleness , watching Jeffs hurrying in and out below with infinite pity , while we listened to the palms rustling and whispering as they bent and courtesied before us , aud saw the sunshine turn the mountains a light green , like dry moss , or leave half of them dark and sombre when a cloud passed in between . It was a clean , lazy little place of many clay huts , with gardens back of them filled with bananapalms and wide-reaching trees , which were one mass of brilliant crimson flowers . In the centre of the town was a grass-grown plaza where the barefooted and ragged boy- soldiers went // through leisurely evolutions , and the mules and cows gazed at them from the other end . Our hotel was leased by an American woman , who was making an unappreciated fight against dirt and insects , and the height of whose ambition was to get back to Brooklyn and take in light sewing and educate her two very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his portrait hung in the dining-room of the hotel . She used to talk about him while she was helping at dinner , and of what a well-read and able man he had been . She would grow so interested in. her stories that the dinner would turn cold while she stood gazing at the picture and shaking her head at it . We became very much interested in the husband , and used to look up over our shoulders at his portrait with respectful attention , as though he were present . His widow did not like Honduranians ; she might have made enough money to take her home . had she consented to accept them as boarders , but she would only receive gringos at her hotel , which she herself swept and scrubbed when she was not cooking the dinner and making the beds . She had saved eight dollars of the sum necessary to convey her and her children home , and to educate them when they got there ; and as American travellers in Honduras are few , and as most of them ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am afraid her chance of seeing the Brooklyn Bridge is very doubtful . We contributed to her fund , and bought her a bundle of lottery tickets , which we told her were the means of making money easily ; and I should like to add that she won the grand prize , and lived happily on Brooklyn Heights ever after ; but when we saw the list at Panama , her numbers were not on it , and so , I fear , she is still keeping the only clean hotel in Honduras , which is something more difficult to accomplish and a much more pubhic-spir ited timing to do than to win a grand prize in a lottery . We left San Pedro Sula on a Sunday morning , with a train of eleven mules , five to carry our luggage and the other six for ourselves , Jeffs , Charwood , Somerset 's servant , and Emilio , our chief moso , or muleteer . There were two other mosos , who walked the entire distance , and in bull-hide sandals at that , guarding and driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with us an hour or so after we had halted for the night . I do not know which was the worst of the mosos , although Emilio seems to have been first choice with all of us . We agreed , after it was all over , that we did not so much regret not having killed them as that they could not know how frequently they had been near to sudden and awful death . The people of Honduras , where all the travelling is done on mule or horse back , have a pretty custom of riding out to meet a friend when he is known to be coming to town , and of accompanying him when he departs . This latter ceremony always made me feel as though I were an undesirable citizen who was being conveyed outside of the city limits by a Vigilance Committee ; hut it is very well OUR NAVAL ATTAcHE . // meant , and a man in Honduras measures his popularity by the number of friends who come forth to greet him on his arrival , or who speed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were accompanied out of San Pedro Sula by the consular agent , the able American manager of the thirty-seven miles of railroad , and his youthful baggage-master , a young gentleman whom I had formerly known at Newport , and who is generally supposed to be dead . Since our meeting he had been four times around the world as a sailor before the mast , had played in Ed Cleary 's Pinafore company at Valparaiso , waited on table at Seattle , and tried ranching in Patagonia ; and I afterwards learne&amp; from an officer of Admiral Meade 's squadron that once when he was serving his country on a man-of-war he came aft in his bare feet and threw the ship 's doctor into hysterics by offering him letters of introduction to all the principal clubs in Sari Francisco . Our escort left us at the end of a few miles , at the foot of the mountains , and we began the ascent alone . From that time on until we reached the Pacific Ocean we moved at the rate of three miles an hour , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honduras , ten hours being a day 's journey . Our mules were not at all the animals that we know as mules in the States , but rather overgrown donkeys or burros , and not much stouter than those in the streets of Cairo , whether it be the Street in Cairo of Chicago , or the one that runs in front of Shepheard 's Hotel . They were patient , plucky , and wonderfully sure-footed little creatures , and so careful of their own legs and necks that , after the first few hours , we ceased to feel any anxiety about our own , and left the entire charge of the matter to them . I think we were all a little startled at sight of the trail we were expected to follow , but if we were we did not say so , at least not before Jeffs . It led almost directly up the face of the mountain , along little ledges and pathways cut in the solid rock , and at times was so slightly marked that we could not see it five yards ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail was always leading upwards , the mules did not once put down any one of their four little feet without first testing the spot upon which it was to rest . This made our progress slow , but it gave one a sense of security , which the angle and attitude of the body of the man in front did much to dissipate . I do not know the name of the mountains over which we passed , nom* do I know the name of any mountain in Honduras , except those which we named ourselves , for the reason that there is not much in Honduras except mountains , and it would be as difficult to give a name to each of her many peaks as to christen every town site on a Western prairie . When the greater part of all the earth of a country stands on edge in the air , it would be invidious to designate any OI ) ** particular hill or chain of hills . A Honduranian deputy once crumpled up a page of letter-paper in his hand and dropped it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " is an outline map of Honduras . " We rode in single file , with Jeffs in front , followed by Somerset , with Griscom and myself next , and Charwood and Emilio bringing up the rear . The packmules , as I have said , were two hours farther back , and we could sometimes se&amp; them over the edge of a precipice crawling along a thousand feet below and behind us . It seemed an unsociable way for friends to travel through a strange country , and I supposed that in an hour or so we would come to a broader trail and pull up abreast and exchange tobaccopouches and grow better acquainted . But we never came to that broad trail until w&amp; had travelled sixteen days and had left Tegucigalpa behind us , and in the foreground of all the pictures I have in my mind of Honduras there is always a row of men 's backs and shoulders and bobbinghelmets disappearing down a slippery path of rock , or rising above the edge of a mountain and outlined against a blazing blue sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we spoke in a loud* vokie or turned in time saddle , though sometimes we rode silently , and merely raised an arm to point at a beautiful valley below or at a strange bird on a tree , and kept it rigid until the man behind said , " Yes , I see , " when it dropped , like a semaphore signal after the train has passed . - Early in the afternoon of the day of our setting forth we saw for the last time time thatched roofs of San Pedro Sula , lik&amp; a bare spot in the great green plain hundreds of feet below us , and then we passed through the clouds we had watched from the town itself , and bade the eastern coast of Honduras a final farewell . // The trail we followed was so rough and uncertain that at first I conceived a very poor opinion of the Honduranians for not having improved it , but as we continued scrambling upwards I admired them for moving about at all under such conditions . After all , we who had chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain of what was to the natives their only means of communication with the outside would . It is interesting to think of a country absolutely and entirely dependent on such a thoroughfare for every necessity of life . For whether it be a postal card or a piano , or a bale of cotton , or a box of matches , it must be brought to Tegucigalpa on the back of a mule or on the shoulders of a man , who must slip and slide and scramble over this trail for nine days . Sometimes this highroad of commerce was cut through the living rock in steps IN A cENTRAL-AMERICAN FORE5T. // as even and sharp as those in front of a brownstone house on Fifth Avenue , and so narrow that we had to draw up our knees to keep them from being scratched and cut on the rough walls of the passageway , and again it led through jungle so dense that if one wandered three yards from the trail he could not have found his way back again ; but this danger was not imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail without having first hacked and cut his way there . It was not always so difficult ; at times we came out into bare open spaces , and rode up the dry bed of a mountain stream , and felt the 7full force of the sun , or again it led along a ledge of rock two feet wide at the edge of a precipice , and we were fanned with cool damp breaths from the pit a thousand feet below , where the sun had never l ) enetrated , and where the moss and fern of ceaturies grew in a thick dark tangle . We stopped for our first meal at a bare place on the top of a mountain , where there were a half-dozen mud huts . Jeffs went from one to another of these and collected a few eggs , and hired a woman to cook them and to make us some coffee . We added tinned things and bread to this luncheon , which , as there were no benches , we ate seated on the ground , kicking at the dogs and pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food in our hands . In Honduras there are so few hotels that travellers are entirely dependent for food and for a place in which to sleep upon the people who live along the trail , who are apparently quite hardened to having their homes invaded by strangers , and their larders levied upon at any hour of the day or night . Even in the larger towns and socalled cities we slept in private houses , and on the solitary occasion when we were directed to a hotel we found a bare room with a pile of canvas cots heaped in one corner , to which we were told to help ourselves . There was a real hotel , and a very had one , at the capital , where we fared much worse than we had often done in the interior ; but with these two exceptions we were dependent for shelter during our entire trip across Honduras upon the people of the country . Sometimes they sent us to sleep in the town-hall , which was a large hut with a mud floor , and furnished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stocks for prisoners ; for it served as a school or prison or hotel , according to the needs of the occasion . We were equally dependent upon the natives for our food . We carried breakfast bacon and condensed milk and sardines and bread with us , and to these we were generally able to add , at least once a day , coffee and eggs and beans . The national bread is the tortilla . It is made of corn meal , patted into the shape of a buckwheat cake between the palms of the hands , and then baked . They were generally given to us cold in a huge pile , and were burnt on both sides , but untouched by heat in the centre . The coffee was always excellent , as it should have been , for the Honduranian coffee is as fine as any grown in Central America , and we never had too much of it ; but of eggs and black beans there was A DRAWER 0 WATER . // no end . The black-bean habit in Honduras is very general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes cold and sometimes hot , sometimes with bacon and sometimes alone . They were frequently served to us in the shape of sand wiches between tortillas , and again in the form of pudding with chopped-up goat 's meat . At first , and when they were served hot , I used to think them delicious . That seems very long ago now . When I was at Johnstown at the time of the flood , there was a soda cracker , with jam inside , which was served out to the correspondents in place of bread ; and even now , if it became a question of my having to subsist on those crackers , and the black beans of Central America , or starve , I am sure I should starve , and by preference . We were naturally embarrassed at first when we walked into strange huts ; but the owners seemed to take such invasions with apathy and as a matter of course , and were neither glad to see us when we came , nor relieved when we departed . They asked various prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have asked a native for the same service , at least so Jeffs told us ; but as our bill never amounted to more than fifty cents apiece for supper , lodging , and a breakfast the next morning , they can not be said to have robbed us . While the woman at the first place at which we stopped boiled the eggs , her husband industriously whittled a lot of sharp little sticks , which he distributed amongst us , and the use of which we could not imagine , until we were told we were expected to spike holes in the eggs with them , and then suck out the meat . We did not make a success of this , and our prejudice against eating eggs after that fashion was such that we were particular to ask to have them fried during the rest of our trip . This was the only occasion when I saw a Honduranian husband help his wife work . After our breakfast on the top of the mountain , we began its descent on the other side . This was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they stepped even more slowly , and so gave us many opportunities to look out over the tops of trees and observe with some misgivings the efforts of the man in front to balance the mule by lying flat on its hind quarters . The temptation at such - times to sit upright and see into what depths you were going next was very great . We struck a level trail about six in the evening , and the mules were so A STRETCH OF CENTRAL-AMERICAN RAILWAY . // delighted at this that they started off of their own accord at a gallop , and were farther encouraged by our calling them by the names of different Spanish genel ' - als . This inspired them to such a degree that we had to change their names to Bob Ingersoll or Senator Hill , or others to the same effect , at which they grew discouraged and drooped perceptibly . We slept that night at a ranch called La Pieta , belonging to Dr. Miguel Pazo , where we experimented for the first time with our hammocks , and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large household of Indian maidens , mosos , and cowboys . There are men who will tell you that they like to sleep in a hammock , just as there are men who will tell you that they like the sea best when it is rough , and that they are happiest when the ship is throwing them against the sides and superstructure , and when they can not sit still without bracing their legs against tables and stanchions . I always want to ask such men if they would prefer land in a state of perpetual earthquake , or in its normal condition of steadiness , and I have always been delighted to hear sea-captains declare themselves best pleased with a level keel , and the chance it gives them to go about their work without having to hang on to handrails . And I had * feeling of equal satisfaction when I saw as many sailors as could find room sleeping on the hard deck of a man-of-war at Colon , in preference to suspending themselves in hammocks , which were swinging empty over their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees , with the weight of both his legs and his body on the base of the spinal column , which gets no rest in consequence . The hammock is , however , almost universally used in Honduras , and is a necessity there on account of the insects and ants and other beasts that climb up the legs of cots and inhabit the land . But the cots of bull-hide stretched on ropes are , in spite of the insects , greatly to be preferred ; they are at least fiat , and one can lie on them without having his legs three feet higher than his head . Their manufacture is very simple . When a steer is killed its hide is pegged out on the ground , and left where the dogs can eat what flesh still adheres to it ; and when it has been cleaned after this fashion and the sun has dried it , ropes of rawhide are run through its edges , and it is bound to a wooden frame with the hairy side up . It makes a cool , hard bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children at night , and spread directly on the earth floor . During the day the same hides are used to hold the coffee , which is piled high upon them and placed in the sun to dry . We left La Pieta early the next morning , in the bright sunlight , but instead of climbing laboriously into the sombre mountains of the day before , we trotted briskly along a level path between sunny fields and *delicate plants , and trees with a pale green foliage , and covered with the most beautiful white and purple flowers . There were hundreds of doves in the air , and in the bushes many birds of brilliant blue and black or orange and scarlet plumage , and one of more sober colors with two long white tail feathers and a white crest , like a macaw that had turned Quaker . None of these showed the least inclination to disturb himself as we approached . An hour after our setting forth we plunged into a forest of manacca-palms , through which we rode the rest of the morning . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manacca-palm differs from the cocoanut or royal palm in that its branches seem to rise directly from the earth , and not to sprout , as do the others , from the top of a tall trunk . Each branch has a single stem , and the leaf spreads and falls from either side of this , cut into even blades , like a giant fern . There is a plant that looks like the manacca - palm at home which you see in flower-pots in the corners of drawing-rooms at weddings , and consequently when we saw the real manaccapalm the effect was curious . It did not seem as though they were monster specimens of these little plants in the States , but as though we had grown smaller . We felt dwarfed , as though we had come across a rose-bush as large as a tree . The branches of these palms were sixty feet high , and occasionally six feet broad , and bent and swayed and interlaced in the most graceful and exquisite confusion . Every blade trembled in the air , and for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustle . Not even the hoofs of our mules gave a sound , for they trod on the dead leaves of centuries . The palms made a natural archway for us , and the leaves hung like // a portiZ*re across the path , and you would alike , with no attempt at ornamentasee the man riding in front raise his arm tion within , or landscape-gardening withand push the long blades to either side , out , although nature has furnished the and disappear as they fell again into place most beautiful of plants and trees close behind him . It was like a scene on the on every side for just such a purpose . tropical island of a pantomime , where The walls of a Honduranian hut are everything is exaggerated both in size and made of mud packed round a skeleton of in beauty . It made you think of a giant interwoven rods ; the floor is of the naaquarium or conservatory which had been ked earth , and the roof is thatched with long neglected . the branches of palms . After the house qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout-rod , and sprang upright again with a sweep and rush as the monkeys leaped off chattering ' into the depths of the forest . We rode through this enchanted wilderness of wavering sunlight and damp green shadows for the greater part of the day , and came out finally into a broad open plain , cut up by little bubbling streams , flashing brilliantly in the sun . It was like an awakening from a strange and beautiful nightmare . In the early part of the afternoon we arrived at another one of the farm-houses belongin , , to young Dr. Pazo , and at which he and his brother happened to be stopping . We had ridden out of our way there in the hopes of obtaining a few days ' shooting , and the place seemed to promise much sport . The Adams River , filled with fish and alligators , ran within fifty yards of the house ; and great forests , in which there were bear and deer and wild-pig , stretched around it and beyond it on every side . The house itself was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all built very much GENERAL LOUI5 BOGRAN , EX-PRESIDENT . // ter for drinking and cooking is kept in round jars of red clay , which stand in rings of twisted twigs to keep them upright , and the drinking vessels are the halves of gourds , and the ladles are whole gourds , with the branch on which they grew still adhering to them , to serve as a handle . The furnishing of the house shows the same dependence upon nature , the beds are either grass hammocks or the rawhide that I have described , and there are no chairs and few benches , the people preferring apparently to eat sitting on their haunches to taking the trouble necessary to make a chair . Everything they eat , of which there is very little variety , grows just beyond the cleared place around the hut , and can be had at the cost of the little energy necessary to bring it in-doors . When a kid or a pig or a steer is killed , the owner goes out to the nearest peak and blows a blast on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish fresh meat hurry across the mountain to purchase it . As there is no ice from one end of Honduras to the other , meat has to be eaten the day it is killed . This is not the life of the Honduranians who live in the large towns or so-called cities , where there are varying approaches to the comfort of civilized countries , but of the country people with whom we had chiefly to do . It is as near an approach to the condition of primitive man as one can find on this continent . But bare and poor as are the houses ( which are bare not because the people are poor , but because they are indolent ) , there is almost invariably some corner of the hut set aside and ornamented as an altar , or some part of the wall covered with pictures of a religious meaning . When they have no table , the people use a shelf or the stump of a tree upon which to place emblematic figures , which are almost always china dolls , with no original religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tinsel and silk , and which they have surrounded with sardine-tins and empty bottles and pictures from the lids of cigar-boxes . Everything that has color is cherished , and every traveller who passes adds unconsciously to their stock of ornaments in the wrappings of the boxes which he casts away behind him . Sometimes the pictures they use for ornamentation are not half so odd as the fact that they ever should have reached such a wilderness . We were frequently startled by the sight of colored lithographs of theatrical stars , advertising the fact that they were playing under the direction of such and such a manager , and patent- medicine advertisements and woodcuts from illustrated papers , some of them twenty and thirty years old , which were pinned to the mud walls and worshipped as gravely as though they had been pictures of the Holy Family by a Raphael or a Murillo . In one hut we found a life-size colored lithograph of a woman whom , it so happened , we all knew , which was being used to advertise a sewing - machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from home that we bowed to it very politely , and took off our hats , at which the woman of the house , mistaking our deference , placed it over the altar , fearing that she had been entertaining an ang2l unawares . The house of Dr. Pazo , where we were most hospitably entertained , was similar to those that I have described . It was not his home , but what we would call a hunting-box or a ranch . While we were at luncheon he told a boy to see if there were any alligators in sight , in exactly the same tone with which he might have told a servant to find out if the lawn tennis net were in place . The boy returned to say that there were five within a hundred yards of the house . So , after we had patiently waited for Griscom to finish his coffee , we went out on the bank and fired at the unhappy alligators for the remainder of the afternoon . It did not seem to hurt them very much , and certainly did us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to hit it back of the fore leg , or to break its spine where it joins the tail ; and as it floats with only its eyes and a half-inch of its nose exposed , it is difficult to reach either of these vital spots . When the alligator is on a bank , and you attempt to crawl up on it along the opposite bank , the birds make such a noise , either on its account or on their own , that it takes alarm , and rolls over into the water with an abruptness you would hardly expect from so large a body . On our second day at Dr. Pazo 's ranch we divided into two parties , and scoured the wilderness for ten miles around after game . One party was armed with shotguns , and brought back macaws of wonderful plumage , wild turkeys , and quail in abundance ; the others , scorning anything // but big game , carried rifles , and , as a result , returned as they set forth , only with fewer cartridges . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . It was a wild-cat with a long tail , who patiently waited for us in an open place with a calm and curious expression of countenance . I think I was more surprised than he was , and even after I had thrown up the ground under his white belly he stopped and turned again to look at me in a hurt and reproachful manner before lie bounded gracefully out of sight into the underbrush . We also saw a small bear , but he escaped in the same manner , without waiting to be fired upon , and as we had no dogs to send after him , we gave up looking for more , and went back to pot at alligators . There were some excellent hunting-dogs on the ranch , but the Pazo brothers had killed a steer the night we arrived , and had given most ofit to the dogs , so that in the morning they were naturally in no mood for hunting . " What we should have done , " the Pazo brothers said , " was to have tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meat , and then they would have been keen for game in the morning . " As we had travelled three days out of our way to shoot over those same dogs , we could only agree with him politely . It was an interesting example of the spirit in which many things are carried out in Honduras . There was an old grandfather of an alligator whom Somerset and I had repeatedly disturbed in his slumbers . He liked to take his siestas on a little island entirely surrounded by rapids , and we used to shoot at him from the opposite bank of the river . He was about thirteen feet long , and the agility with which he would flop over into the calm little bay , which stretched out from the point on which he slept , was as remarkable as it was disappointing . He was still asleep at his old stand when we returned from our unsuccessful shooting tour , so we decided to swim the rapids and crawl up on him across his little island and attack him from the flank and rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a small scale . On that occasion , if I remember correctly , the raw recruits were uniformed only in Martinis and cartridge - belts ; but we decided to carry our boots as well , because the alligator 's island was covered with sharp // stones and briers , and the sand was very hot , and , moreover , we had but vague ideas about the customs of alligators , and were not sure as to whether he might not chase us . We thought we would look very silly running around a little island pursued by a long crocodile and treading on sharp hot stones in our bare feet . So each of us took his boots in one hand and a repeating-rifle in the other , and with his money-belt firmly wrapped around his neck , plunged into the rapids and started to ford the river . They were exceedingly swift rapids , and made you feel as though you were swinging round a sharp corner on a cable-car with no strap by which to take hold . The only times I could stop at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bed of the river , and was so held in a vise , while the rest of my body swayed about in the current and my boots scooped up the water . When I wanted to go farther I would stick my toes between two more rocks , and so gradually worked my way across , but I could see nothing of Somerset , and so decided that he had been drowned , and went off to avenge him on the alligator . It took me some time to get my bruised and bleeding toes into the wet boots , during which time I kept continually looking over my shoulder to see if the alligator was going to make a land attack , and surprise me instead of my surprising him . I knew he was very near me , for the island smelt as strongly of musk as a cigar-shop smells of tobacco , but when I crawled up on him he was still on his point of sand , and sound asleep . I had a very good chance at seventy yards , but I was greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crawling along , gathering thorns and briers by the way , I startled about fifty birds , and the alligator flopped over again , and left nothing behind him but a few tracks on the land and a muddy streak in the water . It was a great deal of trouble for a very little of alligator ; but I was more or less consoled on my return to find that Somerset was still alive , and seated on the same bank from which we bad both started , though at a point fifty yards farther down stream . He was engaged in counting out damp Bank-of-England notes on his bare knee , and blowing occasional blasts down the barrel of his rifle , which had dragged him and itself to the bottom of the river before the current tossed them both back on the shore . The two days of rest at the ranch of Dr. Pazo had an enervating effect upon our mules , and they moved along so slowly on the day following that we had to feel our way through the night for several hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Griscom and I had lost ourselves on the mountainside , and did not overtake the others until long after they had settled themselves in the compound . They had been too tired when they reached it to do anything more after falling off their mules , and we found them stretched on the ground in the light of a couple of fluttering pine torches , with cameras and saddle-bags and carbines scattered recklessly about , and the mules walking over them in the darkness . A fire in the oven shone through the chinks in the kitchen wall , and showed the woman of the house stirring something in a caldron with one hand and holding her sleeping child on the hip with the other , while the daughters moved in and out of the shadow , carrying jars on their heads and bundles of fodder for the animals . It looked like a gypsy encampment . We sent Emilio back with a bunch of pine torches to find the pack - mules , and we could see his lighted torch blazing far up the trail that we had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of him . There was only room for one of us to sleep inside the hut that night , and as Griscom had a cold , that privilege was given to him ; but it availed him little , for when he seated himself on the edge of the bull-hide cot and began to pull off his boots , five ghostly feminine figures sat upright in their hammocks and studied his preparations with the most innocent but embarrassing curiosity . So , after waiting some little time for them to go to sleep again , he gave up any thought of making himself more comfortable , and slept in his boots and spurs . We passed through the pretty village of Trinidad early the next morning , and arrived at nightfall at the larger town of Santa Barbara , where the sound of our mules ' hoofs pattering over the paved streets and the smell of smoking street lamps came to us with as much of a shock as does the sight of land after a week at sea . Santa Barbara , in spite of its pavements , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its isolation , the advent of five strangers was so much of an event that the children of the town followed us , cheering and jeering as though we were a circus procession ; they blocked the house in which we took refuge , on every side , so that the native policemen had to be stationed at our windows to wave them away . On the following morning we called to pay our respects on General Louis Bogran , who has been President of Honduras for eight years and an exile for two . He is now permitted to remain in his native town of Santa Barbara , but there are many who think it will not be long before he will again reside in the government palace at the capital . He is a very handsome man , with a fine presence , and with great dignity of manner , and he gave us an audience exactly as though he were a dethroned monarch , and we loyal subjects come to pay him homage in his loneliness . I asked him what he regarded as the best work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Peace for eight years , * ' which was rather happy , when you consider that in the three years since he left office there have been four Presidents and two long and serious revolutions , and when we were in the capital the people seemed to think it was about time to begin on another . We left Santa Barbara early the next morning , and rode over a few more mountains to the town of Seguaca , where the village priest was holding a festival , and where the natives for many miles around had gathered in consequence . There did not seem to be much of interest going on when we arrived , for everybody in the town and the visitors within her gates deserted the booths and followed us in a long procession down the single street , and invaded the house where we lunched . Our host on this occasion set a table for us in the centre of his largest room , and the population moved in through the doors and windows , and seated themselves cross-legged in rows ten and fifteen deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us gravely and in absolute silence . Those who could not find standing - room inside stood on the windowsills and blocked the doorways , and the women were given places of honor on tables and beds . It was somewhat embarrassing , and we felt as though we ought to offer something more unusual than 503 the mere exercise of eating in order to justify such interest ; so we attempted various parlor tricks , without appearing to notice the presence of an audience , and pretended to swallow the eggs whole , and made knives and forks disappear in the air and drew silver dollars from the legs of the table , continuing our luncheon in the mean time in a self - possessed and polite manner , as though such eccentricities were our hourly habit . We could see the audience , out of the corner of our eyes , leaning forward with their eyes and mouths wide open . and were so encouraged that we called up some of the boys and drew watches and dollars out of their heads , after which they retired into corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather an expensive exhibition , for when we set forth again they all laid claim to the dollars of which they considered they had been robbed . The men of the place , according to their courteous custom , followed us out of the town for a few miles , and then we all shook hands and exchanged cigars and cigarettes , and separated with many compliments and expressions of high esteem . The trail from Seguaca to where we rested for the night led through pine forests and over layers of pine needles that had been accumulating for years . It was a very warm dry afternoon , and the air was filled with the odor of the pines , and when we came to one of the many mountain streams we disobeyed Jeffs and stopped to bathe in it , and let it carry us down the side of the mountain with the speed of a toboggan . We had been told that bathing at any time was extremely dangerous in Honduras , and especially so in the afternoon , but we always bathed in the afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these roaring rapids as the best part of the day . Of all our recollections of Honduras , they are certainly the pleasantest . The water was almost icily cold , and fell with a rush and a heavy downpour in little waterfalls , or between great crevices in the solid rocks , leaping and bubbling and flashing in the sun , or else sweeping in swift eddies in the compass of deep , shadowy pools . We used to imprison ourselves between two rocks and let a fall of water strike us from the distance of several feet on our head and shoulders , or tear past and around us , so that in five minutes the // soreness and stiffness of the day 's ride were rubbed out of us as completely as though we had been massaged at a Turkish bath , and the fact that we were always bruised and black and blue when we came out could not break us of this habit . It was probably because we were new to the country that we suffered no greater harm ; for Jeffs , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular stream for the first time , came out looking twenty years older , and in an hour his teeth were chattering with chills or clinched with fever , and his pulse was jumping at one hundred and three . We were then exactly six days ' hard riding from any civilized place , and though we gave him quinine and whiskey and put him into his hammock as soon as we reached a hut , the evening is not a cheerful one to remember . It would not have been a cheerful evening under any circumstances , for we shared the hut with the largest and most varied collection of human beings , animals , and insects that I have ever seen gathered in so small a place . I took an account of stock before I turned in , and found that there were three dogs , eleven cats , seven children , five men ( not including five of us ) , three women , and a dozen chickens , all sleeping , or trying to sleep , in the same room under the one roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the night , I stepped on the pigs , and startled three or four calves that had been sleeping under the porch and that lunged up out of the darkness . We were always asking Jeffs why we slept in such places , instead of swinging our hammocks under the trees and camping out decently and in order , and his answer was that while there were insects enough in-doors , they were virtually an extinct species when compared to the number one would meet in the open air . I have camped in our West , where all you need is a blanket to lie upon and another to wrap around you , and a saddle for a pillow , and where , with a smouldering fire at your feet , you can sleep without thought of insects . But there is nothing green that grows in Honduras that is not A HALT AT TRINIDAD . // saturated and alive with bugs , and all manner of things that creep and crawl and sting and bite . It transcends mere discomfort ; it is an absolute curse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would be as absurd to write of Honduras without dwelling on the insects , as of the west coast of Africa without speaking of the fever . You can not sit on the grass or on a fallen tree , or walk under an upright one or through the busbes , without hundreds of some sort of animal or other attaching themselves to your clothing or to your person . And if you get down from your mule to take a shot at something in the bushes and walk but twenty feet into them , you have to be beaten with brushes and rods when you come out again as vigorously as though you were a dusty carpet . There will be sometimes as many as a hundred insects under one leaf ; and after they have once laid their claws upon you , your life is a mockery , and you feel at night as though you were sleeping in a bed with red pepper . The mules have even a harder time of it ; for , as if they did not suffer enough in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which fasten themselves to the neck and suck out the blood , leaving them so weak that often when we came to saddle them in the morning they would stagger and almost fall . Sometimes the side of their head and shoulders would be wet with their own blood . I never heard of a vampire attacking a man in that country , but the fact that they are in the air does not make one sleep any the sounder . In the morning after our night with the varied collection of men and animals we put back again to the direct trail to Tegucigalpa , from which . place we were still distant a seven days ' ride .
