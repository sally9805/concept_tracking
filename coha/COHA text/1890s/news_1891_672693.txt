txt The Directors of the ' World 's Columbian Exposition to-day refused to oon/irra several of Director Davis 's nominations of Department Chiefs . They rejected Walter S. Maxwell to be Chief of the Horticultural Department by a vote of 25 to 8 , and refused to confirm E. Stone as Chief of the Department of Foreign Affairs . In the general war that was-declared on Director General Davis 's nominations Fred V. 3 . Skiff of Colorado was more fortunate , for the board confirmed him as Chief of the Department of Minkel and Mining . Mr. Blaine 's hand is clearly seen in the rejeo Lion of Mr. Stone . When Mr. Blaine made his European trip Mr. Stone was editorof a Chicago newspaper and detailed a reporter to follow Blaine all over Europe . Blaine has never forgotten this . There is a further reason for the rejection in the old fight between the different branches of the World 's Fair management . Mr Stone might have fared better but for the resolution adopted by the Board of Control , declaring that all treaties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspices of the National Commission or its ? Slicers and not by agents of the local Directors . This resolution was adopted Thursday and sent to President Baker . Instead of taking any notice of the resolution , the Directors promptly held . Mr. Stone 's confirmation up . The resolution of the Board of Control was adopted in pursuance of that section of the act of Congress that declares that all negotiations with foreign Governments shall be conducted by the National Commission . While the Federal Commietsioners have not heretofore exercised the authority given to them by Congress , they have never surrendered their rights in that respect and were preparing to begin a vigorous foreign policy . At an informal conference after the Directors adjourned yesterday , members of the Board of Control cautioned Director General Davis that he would not be allowed to issue any commissions to agents going abroad to " work for the fair . They will not even permit him to sanction the work that was to be done by exGOV . Waller , Carl Schurz , ex-Senator Eustis , Promoter General Handy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credentials or recognition whatever . An entire rearrangement of the commission will be demanded . The light is a square one between the Blaine and anti-Blaine people over the control of the foreign department . The local papers , notably the Chicago Tribune , have cilltied THE TisiEs for calling attention to this unseemly row and have declared that there Was only peace and harmony in the management of the fair . So far they have been able to gloss over the trouble for the benefit of their readers . But it will be no longer possible to conceal the fact that there is a glorious row in the tuner circles . The trouble has only begun . Contracts Ior the manufactures and liberal arts and the woman 's building were let this week . Members of the California State Commission have applied to the Ways and Means Committee for the privilege of selling wines and fresh fruits in their State building . They were informed that such sales , if made at all , would be subject to the same restrictions as those governing other dealers . Manufacturers of sawmills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their display- One reason for this 16 that space in Machinery Hall is too valuable for a display which would require a great deal of room . Officers of the llllnois Central Railroad have named $5 per car as the switching rate for oars containing building material This rate applies to consignments from all intersections except Harvey and is Stock Yards , from which points the rates will be $6 per car . An additional charge of from $1 to $2 will be made for switching the oars to the buildings for which the material is to be used . This will be paid to the Exposition Company , and for that work the Illinois Central furnishes two engines without charge . Traveling men will take an active part in the World 's Fair . They are going to hold a congress in July , and will spend $50,000 to make it a success . All of the associations of traveling men throughout the country will be asked to take part in the work of booming the exposition in general , and the Traveling Men 's Congress in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part in the exposition , says that the Government has appropriated $100.000 for a display , and will require one acre of ground for its buildings . The Dairy School promises to be one of the interesting and novel features of the rata The school will be conducted in the nature of a contest in milk giving and butterinakfrig . The cows will De fed and milked , and the buttermanufactured and sold on the grounds . The dairy associations wish to have the work done and the tests made publicly , so that those interested may see the entire process . The first united effort to have the ? exposition kept open Sundays originated in California . Petitions have been prepared and sent all over the country requesting the National Commissioners to keep the gates open seven days of the week . It is not probable that any action will be taken on the Sunday opening question until early in 1-893 . Petitions against keeping the gates open Sunday continue to pour in on Secretary Dickinson , and , acting under instructions of the commission , they are referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees lit to take the question up . When it conies before the commission severer members will make a strong light for a seven-day fair . Commissioner Massey will probably lead the debate . Congressman Allen C. Durborow of Chicago wants Congress to hold an extra session in this city daring the dedicatory ceremonies in October , 1892 . He has a plan which , if carried out , will bring President Harrison and his Cabinet , the Justices of the Supreme Court , and both branches of ; Congress , as well as every State Legislature in the country , to Chicago . His idea is that these bodies should assemble in large halls and be addressed by their leading members on the subject of the discovery of America and the World 's Columbian Exposition . The appropriation of Illinois will be $300,000 . Efforts of friends of the bill to raise the amount to $1.000,000 failed , and a bill for $800,000 was agreed upon . The appropriation will be expended under the direction of the State Board of Agriculture . Attorney General Miller has rendered a decision that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the effect that these exhibitors can bring with them enough employes to show the process of manufacturing the goods they display without being held for violation of the contract-labor law . The decision was rendered at the request of the French Consul in Chicago , who represented that many manufacturers in Prance would not take part in the fair unless they could bring a limited number of employes along . An address has been issued by the General Committee on Labor Congresses of the World 's Congress Auxiliary . The General Labor Congress will be arranged with the co-operation of the most distinguished students of labor problems and the most widely known leaders in the industrial world .
