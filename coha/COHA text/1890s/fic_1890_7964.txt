Adams , Oscar Fay , 1855-1919 : RENUNCIATION. from Renunciation ( 1890 ) Nay , friend , farewell ! for if I loved you less , It might be I should strive to hold you fast In bonds of friendship you had long o'erpast , And play the tyrant where I hoped to bless . Yet , since my love still pleads , I fain would press Once more your hand e'en while I seem to cast It coldly from me with these words at last ,  --  I may not keep and you may not possess ! Sweet friend , believe me , it is better so ,  --  To part while love finds yet no cause for grief In slowly-waning faith , lest haply you Should one day find some flaw in me you knew Not of , and I through tears should watch you go , Knowing your soul in mine had lost belief . Oscar Fay Adams .
