By Benlamin Pen/ia/low S/izYlal*er . I. N a cold and disagree able morning in the spring of 1833 the writer became a passenger on * the daily coach flying between Portsmouth , N. H. , and Boston , and took his seat , outside , with Mendrum - " Jack " familiarly called , - the best driver on the route . Though the day was not auspicious , and his feelings had been tried by an affectionate parting from home , the boy of eighteen , embarked on a new enterprise , soon overcame desponding reflections , and surrendered himself to the novelty of his ever changing environment . Every mile was replete with new interest , and the future was radiant with hope . There was a check to exuberance , however , while riding over Hampton marshes . His hat blew ofi ; necessitating a stop to recover it , and the objurgations of " Jack " and the delayed passengers on his defenceless head were fearful , as he took his seat again on the box with the driver . Mendrum was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad impression his free remarks had made on his young companion , he tapped a fount of anecdotes for his delectation , thus restoring good fellowship between them . About five o'clock , p . M. Boston was reached . The coach rattled under the arch-way of the old Eastern Stage-House , in Ann street , and the inside passengers " booked " themselves for the night . The outsider was " looked for " and soon found himself in other quarters . The Eastern Stage House of that day , kept by Captain Brown , was a paintedbrick edifice , three stories high , gloomy without , but within cheerful with hospitable fires and genial companionship . It was the resort of eastern people , who there met early associates and welcomed strangers to the metropolis ; and merrier groups it would have been hard to find than assembled under that noted rooftree . The structure was the exact counterpart of the tavern in Golden Cross , where Mr. Pickwick had his first adventure ; the arch leading to the stables in the rear opening beneath , just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box , to avoid a header . Domiciled in a boarding house in Union street , at two dollars per week , and becoming one of a band of twenty congenial spirits , I became very speedily contented , and gave myself up to the enjoyment of new scenes and happy surroundings . A whole block of boarding houses extended from Dr. Hague 's ( Baptist ) church , on the corner of Union and Hanover streets , to the corner of Sudhury street , and at i i . M. , the ringing of the Cockerel Church bell on Hanover street - the signal to " lead on the boarders " - was responded to by a rushing procession of hungry men and women toward their respective quarters , scarcely excelled by the more recent rush on a steamboat at the sound of the dinner gong . Hancock engine , No. 10 , was housed directly opposite . It was the leading " tub " of the old fire department , the members of which company were as acute as greyhounds , on the scent of a fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not if they only had an excuse for getting out the machine and even a poor excuse was not always apparent . I was deeply interested in No. 10 . Shortly after getting settled in my boarding house , a cloud of anxiety hovered over the house resulting from an order from Gov . Everett that the militia of the Commonwealth should be mustered in honor of President Jackson , who was to visit Boston in June . There were twenty in our house eligible for duty , and escape seemed impossible . They went away in // the morning with a despondent feeling lest the recruiting officer should come during their absence and put them in the list , and returned at night feeling crushed with the uncertainty regarding their fate . It was a gloomy time , mirth was tabooed , EXPERIENCES DURING MANY YEARS . by Catharine - the good-natured Irish girl and maid-of-all-work - who was a great favorite with the boarders , and fully understood the situation . She had lived for a number of years in France , and was perfectly familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitors at the door she wittily resolved what to do . The scribe assumed his pen and tablets and prepared to write , and the inquirer , in a pompous manner , asked her if there were any there liable to perform military duty . " I do n't understand , " she replied in French . He looked surprised . " What does she say ? " he asked of his assistant . " I du n no , " was the reply . " Say , " said he , " is there anybody-see , anybody - liable , l-i-a-b-e-l ( spelling the word wrong ) to do - shoulder arms , you know ? " Another response in the lingo irritated the officer exceedingly . " Is there anybody here that can speak English ? " he almost yelled . Another reply in French almost drove him mad . The lady who kept the house , hearing the altercation , put her head out of a near door . She dressed in the most outlandish manner , and wore a turban of the Turkish pattern , rolled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of her through the half-opened door , which instantly satisfied him . " They 're cussed furriners , " Catharine heard him say to his companion as they turned away . That Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber , even the luxuries of the table assumed a two-dollarous aspect . and depression sat , like unraised dumplings , upon every heart . As was expected , one day the enrollers came during the absence of all , one bearing the ink-horn and scroll , the other with the bearing of authority to gather in the names . The door-bell was answered night there was a gathering of the boarders in the kitchen , and Kate was voted the " Kate of their consolation . " Until the event occurred which had threatened their peace , they made their exits and their entrances by the rear door , to evade questioning , all the " liables " in the rest of the block being held to // their obligation to appear " armed and equipped . ' I went to work with a book-printing firm in School street , whose imprint I occasionally meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printer . At that day it was essential that a printer should be a perfect master of all branches of the art , and I applied myself diligently to obtain a knowledge of everything pertaining to the craft , and succeeded measurably well . Our office was at No. 8 , School street , extemporized from an old dxvelling-house , which had yielded as if under protest , the several wall-papers still remaining , and the various closets and fireplaces left as when the occupants held possession , blending the domestic and the mechanical in ludicrous incongruity . The office began on the second floor ( the lower story being vacant ) , the lefthand side of which was occupied by " Peter parley " ( S. G. Goodrich ) , whose juvenile works at that time were numerous and popular . We employed numerous writers , whose works all bore the imprint of " Peter Parley . " He was a tall , dignified and very gentlemanly man , with a face suggestive of good living , his gray hair and gold spectacles giving him a classical appearance . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had led to the upper apartments , but now served as a refectory , which held the many good things of life essential to creature comfort . The part of the stairway floored over above served as a place of deposit for coal , connected with the printing-office . One day some coal was needed and procured , and a sturdy Hibernian employed to lift it from the sidewalk to the receptacle . He had mounted with one basketful on his shoulder and , according to directions , threw it into the old stairway , when , with a great crash , basket , coal and all went tumbling down upon Peter Parley 's delicacies below , mixing them up in indiscriminate ruin . The scene that followed was intensely funny : the Irishman holding on to his hat , and looking down the abyss , while the red face and flashing spectacles looked up from below in angry wonder at the happening , Pat thinking it was a trick put upon him and yelling , in Anglo-Irish , for some one to bring back his basket . The infuriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper flooring of the stairway was strengthened , the coal deposited , and that was the end of it . The Old Corner Bookstore , then kept by Allen &amp; Ticknor , Russell &amp; Odiame , and Leonard C. Bowles furnished printing for the concern with which I was connected , through which I made acquaintance with , or knew of ? , a number of those then famous or who afterwards became so . The U ; u/arian Observer was printed . there , edited by Rev. Dr. Ezra S. Gannett , I think , in which a discussion was pursued for several months between Orestes A. Brownson and two young theological students , respectively G. E. E* and C. A. B. , whose initials will be recognized . The Scr45tura/ Interpreter was likewise printed there , edited by Mr. Gannett , and published , with the Observer , by Leonard C. Bowles . One of the contributors to the Interpreter was remarkable for wearing low-quartered shoes in winter , great theological research , . and a querulous temper , and quite a scene was at times exhibited when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Gannett himself was a very nervous man , and would have things done his own way , as I realized on one occasion . I had set up a sermon for him , and assumed the printer 's right to punctuate , sprinkling in commas and semi-colons lavishly . When the proof was returned I found that every point I had put in was marked out , with a note on the margin : " I am writing for adults , not children . " The New England Farmer , edited by Thos . G. Fessenden , was also printed in the office . Mr. Fessenden was the " Dr. Caustic , " contemporary with Washington Irving and James K. Paulding , and a subject for their most pungent sarcasm in " Salmagundi . " He was a dark , ponderous man , without a trace of humor in his appearance , and yet he had written much of a witty character in the past , and had published a sarcastic volume in London - where he had found himself shelved and in a severe strait - called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor of the old bank-bill plate , who // had a remedy for all nervous diseases , which he called " Tractors . " There was embryotic electricity in it - two magnetic points applied to the parts affected , to restore interrupted circulation , which did not strike the Englishmen , and Fessenden was reduced to write his hook . He was affable and kind , and a great favorite with his printers and his readers . Mrs. Lydia Maria Child had her " Appeal in Behalf of that Class of Americans called Africans , " her Auti-Slaverj ' Annual , and her Young Housekeeper . She was a very charming woman , short and plump , with a ruddy and very expressive face , and eyes sharply comprehensive of everything they rested on . I can not remember that I came in for more than a fair share in her regard . She was very particular about her proofs , and on one occasion there came near happening a mistake , that , hut for its timely discovery , might have caused trouble . Each chapter of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them was , " Skins may differ , " etc . To the horror and ange of the printer this was found to read , just as the proof was to he sent to Mrs. Child , " S/ibis may differ . " There was an investigation , but the compositor who set it up was a dull man , who claimed that he followed copy , deeming that the word " shins " conveyed the better meaning . I had the honor of setting up John G. Whittier 's " Slave Ships " for the Annual . Science , too , added to the variety of print pertaining to the office . Spurzheim had just sprung phrenology on Boston , which was agog with the fascinating science , and Dr. N. B. Shurtleff was an early convert and published a book on the subject , while Dr. A. A. Gould , the conchologist , was a constant visitant , superintending the preparation of a valuable work on shells . Besides these was the pictorial introduction to a Polyglot Bible , to be published by a Brattleboro ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for variety and yielded abundant opportunity for becoming acquainted with those connected with the book-making and printing guilds . The " Old Corner Bookstore , " in 1833 , occupied by Allen &amp; Ticknor , was an object of deep interest to me . From it were issued many books , even then , and more than professional interest was awakened by the fact that James T. Fields , my early friend and townsman , was connected with it . From the rear window of the printing office the cupola of the royal Province House , surmounted by the Indian-vane , arose above the buildings that surrounded it , the most prominent of which was the gallery of Chester Harding , the portrait painter , the large window of which looked down upon a square of back yards , of most inartistic quality ; and the Rev. Hosea Ballon 's Universalist church , formed the xvesterly / side of a quadrangle , our office form ing the northerly side , continued to Washington street by Sumner s crockery store . The entrxnce to the gallery was through a passage-way from School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most noted artist of that May , and his portraits were held in high repute . He painted the most distinguished people in town , and many came from far to be depicted by him . Carriages were constantly bringing subjects for the practice of his art ; but the artist , hidden by the green cambric curtain , which half shrouded his window , was rarely seen . A silent mystery rested upon his precinct , impenetrable to the square , and yet " Hardin&amp; s Gallery " was a famed resort to lovers of art , next to the Athen*eum in importance . Mr. Harding on the street was a tall , commanding man , with a face indicative of good-living , but his bearing denoted reserve and a withdrawing from social intimacy . He became , I believe , wealthy , but I know nothing of him subsequently to * save that he painted a picture of " Boz " ( Charles Dicken5 ) in 43 , as I remember him with his amplitude of waistcoat and ambrosial look . Mr. Ballou , daily seen upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most commanding figure , tall and stately , his face grave but benign in its expression , his bearing indicative of benevolence and kindness . He was an object to me of profound reverence , the character of his ministration , I thought , indicated in his presence . I frequently attended his church , and learned to admire him for his earnest // eloquence in support of the doctrines contained in his then unpopular belief . He was the acknowledged chief of his denomination , and was very emphatic in enforcing his arguments . One Sunday he was at his best , and had presented a figure of rhetoric that to sensitive ears was startling , when a man in the seat behind me , evidently a stranger there , leaned forward and tapped me on the shoulder . " Who-who -- is that ? " said he , in an anxious whisper . I told him that it was Hosea Ballon . He appeared horrorstruck and , seizing his hat darted for the door . He had probably come there , mistaking the church for the Methodist church in Bromfield street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which not unfrequently happened . Once an out-oftown minister , engaged to exchange with his Bromfield street brother , came up into Mr. Ballous pulpit . Mr. Ballou received him cordially and invited him to stay , but , learning his mistake , he made speedy tracks from the perilous ground . There were two classes of Universalists at that day , the most numerous body maintaining the tenets of John Murray as promulgated by Mr. Ballou , holding that all sins were forgiven at death , and the sinner , however wicked , was transformed and saved through the Redeemer 's intervention ; the other , represented by Rev. Paul Deane , believing in the gospel of universal salvation , but making the salvation conditional , attained only through merit , winning but by spiritual seeking and repentence in the world to come . These were called Restorationists , and there was a silent feud and non-intercourse between them . But new light brought a change of condition . The ultra conservatives yielded to awakened reason , and the two divisions merged in one , the Restorationist doctrines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the progressive ideas being the faith of the denomination after the death of Mr. Ballon and his contempories . The Universalists avowed their faith in a creed and were preached against as infidels , while the Unitarians , with no creed , were more mildly regarded . Many stories were rife regarding Mr. Ballou . He and Rev. Dr. Lyman Beecher , of Park street church , were intimate friends , and were continually in pleasant controversy . On one occasion Dr. Beecher greeted him with the text : " The wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that fear not God . " " Now , " said the Doctor , " how can you get them out ? " " Well , " replied Ballou , " I read that death and hell were cast into the liquid fire , ' and how are you to put them in ? " On another occasion a lady said to him , " Mr. Ballou , how do you construe to your congregation the text , Ye generation of vipers , how shall ye escape the damnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam , " said he , " I have none of that class in my parish . " II . FROM my earliest boyhood , beyond the infantile period , I had delighted in witnessing stage plays , and indulged , so far as a very limited exchequer would admit , when good companies , or those of a " provincial " cast , came to Portsmouth , where they were gladly welcomed . I once walked from Dover to Portsmouth , - twelve miles - on a hot summer day , to see " She Stoops to Conquer " and " The Maid of Munster " performed by the Tremont Theatre Company , with Geo . H. Barrett and wife , Win . H. Smith and wife , Thayer , Johnson , Andrews , Mrs. Barnes , Miss McBride and others whose names I have forgotten in the troupe . Portsmouth was a patron of the drama long before it was tolerated in Boston , and plays were performed without resorting to the subterfuge of calling them " Moral Lectures , " under interdiction of law . The drama was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first wish , on arriving , was to see a play . On the evening of my first pay day I started out , alone , to find the old Boston Theatre , with the location of which I had made myself acquainted ; but , on arriving , I found the door locked and not a sign of light visible about the building . I was greatly perplexed and probably showed it in my manner , for a gentleman who was passing kindly asked what I was seeking . I told him my purpose , when he informed me that the theatre was not open on Saturday // evenings , and seeing I was a stranger , he adjured me , in the absence of those who had a right to advise , to abandon an intention which would be disastrous to me in the end , and take higher and nobler action in life than to indulge in its frivolities which were spread to attract the unwary on every side in a great city . This , and much more , was said , the speaker assuming no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as we stood beside a lamp-post , he " held me with his glittering eye , " a willing listener , for a quarter of an hour . A father 's wishes for his own son could have been no more tender than those he breathed for me as we parted . Those words had their effect in many ways . They restrained my theatrical bent for months , and , though afterwards a good p ! ay was my delight , and is still , I have never forgotten the admonition . President Jackson visited Boston June 30 , 1833 , and I remember the feeling of fiendish glee with which I looked upon our state militia as they were reviewed by the President and Governor Everett the next day after his arrival , conscious of my own escape . He was received royally by officials , troops and people , everybody desirous of seeing the old hero ; and as he rode through the streets on a horse three sizes too small for him , his long legs nearly touching the ground , his broad-brimmed white hat constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was majestic in spite of the equine discrepancy . The ovation was hearty and sincere ; party spirit yielded to patriotic admiration , and New Orleans was not so far away , in time , that its defender was forgotten . The streets gave their voice for his welcome , and every window on the route which he passed fluttered with a cambric benediction . As he rode by our premises a volley of wine was poured in honor of the occasion , the head of our firm proclaiming that he had voted against him but regretted that he had done so , drinking his health fervently and wishing him long life . Then the tumult which occurred when the street in front of the Tremont House was packed with people , as " Old Hickory " and his entire cabinet , with many other dignitaries , took their places on top of the front porch ! It was an immense time and I was there to see . But the mutations of life happen very suddenly , and this cordiality was turned into hate when , after the " old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that he had written the order for removing the United States deposits while in Boston . The reaction of feeling was a complete revolution , even the one who had drunk his health and long life saying he would contribute fifty dollars to a fund for procuring the killing of the old rascal . But when Jackson died , a few years afterwards , a public funeral was accorded to him , with a catafalque , mourning councilmen in coaches , and all the pageantry of grief ; the old animosity was buried , and now every tongue that licks a one-cent postage stamp pays tribute to his memory . Long before coming to Boston , I baa become , by reading and private information , quite familiar with localities associated with its history , and my first summer was devoted to visiting the several scenes pertaining to revolutionary incidents , Bunker Hill being especially remembered . A relative of mine had taken part in the battle - Noah Cutts , of Spruce Creek , Me. , who was an object of profound veneration to me , and therefore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . The main features of the hill were then unobscured by buildings , the intrenchments were plainly discernible , the course from Marton 's Point to the redoubt unobstructed , and there were those frequently ready to point out the several salient aspects of the strife , numbers of the participants being then living , and their sons equally able to describe the scene . The monument had been built up about thirty feet , upon which work was suspended , owing to a miscalculation in making the plans , and by its incompleteness added to the interest of the environment . The " spot where Warren fell " was a thrilling thing to see , and my blood curdled to have it told me by one wko saw Ike body , that there it lay , with a bullet hole in the back of the head I was a zealous pilgrim to all the patri // otic shrines , and became so imbued with the Boston atmosphere that I felt myself almost a native. ; few Bostonians excelled me in point of enthusiasm over the city 's history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer to visit the Common , then not invested with trees to any great extent , and " view the landscape o'er " from the Beacon-street mall or , at times , from the higher elevation of the State House steps . The whole view , west and south , was unobstructed , - Brookline , beyond Back Bay , Parker 's Hill , and the circumambient country " clothed in living green , " with scarcely a dwelling in sight . The bay , separated from the Charles river basin by the Mill-dam continuation of Beacon street , was a beautiful sheet of water at high tide . The outer walls of the Public Garden had been laid , and the filling-in commenced , the bay still flowing to its base . The Common , in front of the State House , bordered by the malls on Beacon and Tremont streets , was an uninterrupted green lawn , on which the Lancers were wont to exercise and the militia perform their evolutions , with no admonitions to " keep off the grass . " Before the summer of 1833 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a more social turn , diverting my attention from out-door explorations . I had contracted an intimacy with members of a family residing in Winthrop Square , then occupied for residences , the entrance to which , from Franklin street , was by a court leading by the old Church of the Holy Cross , at night lighted by a " lantern dimly burning ; " and I was a frequent visitor there , as the winter approached . One evening I made a call , and the evening was so pleasantly passed that I took no note of time , nor that a snow-storm , which had commenced when I came in , was now raging violently without . My visit was somewhat prolonged , and I found , on departing , that the snow had piled itself into formidable drifts , the wind raising a hurly , against which it required considerable effort to contend . As I was stumbling along , with my head bent down , I was attracted by an object , just outside the course I was taking - revealed by the flickering lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift . It bore semblance to the human form . As the curiosity of the fisher-girl was excited ( see " Peter Simple " ) by stepping upon the nose of O'Brien , as he lay buried in the sand , my curiosity stayed my steps , and I found , literally buried in the snow : a female form ! I proceeded to push away the snow with my hands , and after a few moments succeeded in freeing the object of my solicitude , whom I found to be alive and sleeping as sweetly as if she had been on a bed of down . As I lifted her up to bear her nearer to the light , she threw an arm around my neck and faintly breathed the name of " Stephen , " relapsing again , into forgetfulness . From her breath I judged the cause of her insensibility . By the dim rays of the lantern she appeared to be a girl not out of her teens , with a very pretty face , and there I stood , the Stephen of her dream , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange situation to be placed in . The snow was pelting pitilessly , and I scarcely knew what to do . I heard the tone of an organ down under the cathedral , and , stooping , could see a figure playing upon it in a far corner , but I could not have made myself heard ; when it occurred to me that I might find a watchman in Franklin street or , failing that , seek the aid of an engine company on the corner of Theatre alley and Franklin street , to free me from my difficulty . Fortunately several of the firemen were at their house , though late ; to them I transferred my burden , and I left her , I confess , almost reluctantly , for she had awakened my deepest pity , and , besides , I felt I had a sort of right to her by original discovery . I plunged out into the snow again , to make my way to my boarding-house , pleased to know that I had probably saved a weak fellow-creature from a miserable death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " Stephen " whose name was so tenderly and fragrantly breathed upon my shoulder a nonentity , and nothing was left me but the mystery and memory of my adventure . // The mutations of a boarding-house career had brought me , in 1834 , around to Court Square , then neighboring with law offices and business plants , with Tudor Building on the corner of Court street , in the basement of which was the embryo of the Parker House , Harvey D. Parker having his business beginning there . It was a noted resort even in those early days . Daniel Webster had his law office above . Tudor 's was a rough two-story building , of dark granite , and looked more like a prison than a structure built for civil uses ; but it was massive and grand , and one of the architectural marvels of its time . When , in later years , it was to be taken down to make way for the new hotel , it was bought for Manchester , N. H. , and every rock was restored to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days agitators against the Catholic religion , and Catholics were denounced as aiming at the subversion of our institutions . Though limited in numbers , with two churches to represent their faith , the Red Woman of Babylon , with her multitudinous offspring , was seen in portentous and perilous perspective by the narrow-minded and bigot. ed ,  --  the majority , with no religion at all , manifesting the deepest interest . There was a convent school on Mount Benedict , the scholars of which were , for the most part , children of the best families of Protestant Boston . The instruction was purely secular , its curriculum confined to the requirements of a refined education . The institution was regarded with deep suspicion , the idea of a " convent " conveying an impression that it must be of a character like those of the Old World , regarding which such fearful stories had been told . Yet it was considered safe from violence , supported as it was by the patronage of Boston . On Saturday . August is , 1834 , a report had gone abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her will , and an excitement ensued that led the selectmen to visit the place and ascertain the correctness of the report . Everything was found to be right ; but instead of immediately publishing the result of their visit , as should have been done , it was deferred , the excitement growing and spreading through Sunday , until , on Monday , when the report was made , but which few heard , the feeling had become irresistible . On the evening of August *9th an alarm of fire was sounded from Charlestown , and the Boston " tubs , " as customary , went over , to find that the alarm had proceeded from the burning of a bonfire on a hill adjacent to Mount Benedict . It was evidently a preconcerted signal to call the firemen from Boston to the scene , who might be incited , as many of them were , to take part in the programme which ensued . Attention was immediately paid to the convent , the gates and doors were forced , the teachers and pupils driven forth into the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand raised to stay the outrage . My gorge arose , next morning , when one of my fellow-boarders , a fireman . exhibited triumphantly a piece of golden drapery taken from the altar . I threatened to inform upon him , but be cried pcccavz and suppressed the evidence of his crime , and I did not , though strongly tempted to do so . The succeeding day was the most serious of any I ever witnessed , before or since . A public meeting was called at noon , over which the venerable Harrison Gray Otis presided . Faneuil Hall was crowded to its utmost holding capacity , and eloquent denunciation of the outrage was uttered by the foremost Boston orators . A silly rumor having found utterance that the Catholics were marching towards Boston from distant places to avenge the burning of the convent , the organized companies were ordered under arms with loaded guns , street patrols were established , people abroad after ten at night commanded to give an account of themselves , and Boston was virtually in a state of siege . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ringing of the Old South Bell . On the 21st was witnessed a series of terrific thunder-storms , which lasted throughout the day , almost unremittingly . At about three o'clock p . M. , the Old South bell struck up a lively peal , which electrified Boston , and , unheeding the // thunder-crash and the rain which was falling in torrents , everybody was out , hurrying to Franklin street . I threw down my composing stick and started with the rest . Franklin street was densely packed by a crowd of anxious people , but there was no angry perturbation . An almost Sunday solemnity pervaded the scene , and Bishop Fenwick , from the *Thurch steps , harangued the multitude , exhorting to peace . It was like oil upon troubled waters . The crowd dispersed and order reigned supreme . The ringing of the bell was for a fire in Roxbury , the lightning having struck a barn . One or two were punished for the grave offence , but the feeling that prevailed reached the jury-room and the greatest offender escaped . Investigation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair , several entire companies were disbanded , and numbers of individual members expelled , but no legal action followed . The outrage reflected discredit upon a body of honorable men , and the large majority repudiated the perpetration . The Boston firemen comprised the very flower of the young men of the town - daring , energetic , active - for whom the service had an indescribable charm . All trades , professions and callings were represented in their ranks , and voluntarily they gave themselves to the public good , defying peril in pursuance of their adopted duty . The twenty engine companies were mainly composed of those living in the vicinity of the venerated " tub , " bearing the local number , and though the united motive was duty to the public , there was a rivalry between the several companies , each claiming superior merit for its own machine and its ability to " wash down " all competitors . One night , during an alarm of fire , there was a collision of several companies in Court street , when I saw the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meteor in the air , to come down with a crash on the heads of contestants for a passage through , which alone the fire helmets worn would have resisted . There would be a struggle for precedence , at times , at a fire , but never to the delay of effort , the engineers settling the matter . So intense were many of them , and so proud of their calling , that they wore about them their belt and " spanners , " when off duty , and , whatever they might be engaged in , when the bell struck for fire , they would leave everything and dart for their machine . There was a sort of poetical witchery , a weird attraction , about the fireman 's duty , of interest to every one , through sympathy with the fireman , and the mode by which alarms were given - the blaring of the bells and , at night , the loud clatter of the watchman 's rattle in the street . In the still of the night , the tinkle of a distant bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , and another , coming nearer , until all the bells conjoined in one accord of alarm , the watchmen sounded their rattles and hoarsely cried " Fire " and everybody on the street took up the cry , sending it into quiet homes . Awakened from their slumbers , all were on the alert , and an aroused town filled the windows , demanding , of passers by , " Where 's the fire ? " Nobody could tell , and the engine ran wildly to find the cause of the alarm , uncertain often what direction to take . I well remember a summer night , in Court Square , when an alarm was given and a bright flame shot up into the sky that called for my pursuit . It was from a fire in a half-finished house , occupied by Irish families , at the corner of Summer and South streets , to some shavings beneath which fire had been set . It was discovered that the fire had been kindled by two joking young carpenters , out on a lark , who from a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , arson at that day being punished with death . I heard the trial , in 1835 , and Russell and Crockett were hanged in March , r8*.6 . I heard another interesting trial in the court-house , afterwards City Hall . An Irishman , a very worthy man , had been to the Quincy Market on a Saturday night , to purchase his small stores , and was returning , through Merchants ' Row , with a large basketful . When opposite Clinton street he was attacked by a band of Boston roughs , his basket upset , and a // violent attack made upon himself . When reduced to the last extremity , he drew a small knife from his pocket and , jerking it open , struck the principal assailant with it . It penetrated to his heart and he died instantly . The man was tried for murder , hut was acquitted . I was in the court-house when the verdict was given . The prisoner stood up within the bar as pale as death . As he heard the words " Not Guilty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him a blow , the pain from which must have kept him from fainting . The seven Spanish pirates , for robbing the brig Mexican , of Salem , and setting fire to her , were tried before Judge Story , at nearly the same time . The court-house was found to be too small , and , after a day or two , the court was *emoved to the hall in Masonic Temple , where the trial was completed , the pirates convicted , and sentence passed . This last was impressive in the highest degree . The gown and black cap gave added solemnity to the occasion , the judge 's sentence - translated for the prisoners - feelingly rendered , and a hush , like the death to which they were doomed , rested upon the crowded audience . One of them , named De Soto , was subsequently pardoned by President Jackson for some humane action he had previously rendered to a wrecked American crew among the Bahamas . He was as handsome a man as I ever saw : tall in figure and very graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large dark eyes as soft and gentle as a woman 's ap-parently ,  --  " As mild a mannered man As ever scuttled ship or cut a throat , " This case was peculiarly interesting to me , as I knew one of the crew of the Mexican , whose memory was chiefly instrumental in convicting the pirates , but whose kind heart would have saved them from their tragic fate . The Mexican was going out , light , with thirty thousand Spanish silver dollars , in the run , with which to purchase Cuban produce for the New England market . She had almost reached her destination , when a long , low , rakish , black schooner hovered about the brig an entire day and night , in the morning bearing down upon her and boarding her with an armed crew . Resistance was useless , the crew were violently driven below , the treasure secured , and after setting fire in the cook 's galley the pirates left , securing the sailors below . A glass skylight over the cabin they had overlooked , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , releasing his companions , a great smoke was kept up until the schooner was out of sight , and the Mexican reached her port . The schooner - the Panda - was afterwards captured by a British cruiser , and the seven pirates , including the captain and mate , were surrendered to American justice , which they received , in Boston , in * with the exception named . III . THE Memorable year , 1835 , was further distinguished , to me , as the year of my majority , the 12th of July being the 21St anniversary of my birthday . The question even then arose , as it has arisen many times since , whether a person is eligible to vote on his 21st birthday or during the year succeeding , as , it was mooted , he could not be twenty-one years old until the last day of the year had expired . I settled the matter , so far as I was concerned , by voting for Martin Van Buren in November . The then " New Court House " was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been suspended during the winter , and a wide trench , filled with water , surrounded it , in March , I 834 , when operations were renewed . One dark and cold evening we were startled by a cry for help as we , some twenty of us , sat about the cannel coal fire . It was hardly definable , at first , but the second appeal was distinct - " Help " We all rushed out to find a poor fellow standing up to his neck in ice-cold water , yelling lustily for assistance . He had been in somewhere to get " something hot , " and after , perhaps , doubling the dose , had attempted to navigate the dark square , when he missed his bearings and fell into the ditch . A more pitiable object it were hard to imagine ; but in spite of all our urging that he should go into the house , // he with drunken persistency refused , and sitting on a convenient block of granite , launched out into a lecture on temperance , exceeding in its practicality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The effort combined philosophy , scripture , humor , pathos and sound sense , which a crowd of listeners , immediately gathered , might have profited by . He was evidently a genius , and the struggle in him between rum and water had keyed him up to a condition of eloquence that made the airs of that dark March night vocal . We left him to the care of others and never learned who he was . There was among our number a young printer , a bright and intelligent man , the embodiment of good humor and social fellowship , but who was addicted to his cups and often came home in a state of intense fuddle , but inoffensive and always gentlemanly in manner . We talked with him about it repeatedly , and he had seriously expressed contrition and promised to reform his habit ; but he had signally failed , and the incident which had occurred suggested the preparation of a total abstinence pledge , binding all the boarders to abstain from drink until January , 1834 , which pledge was prepared and signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sacrifice by doing so . The pledge was kept inviolate during the summer months , but as fall approached , preceding Thanksgiving Day , there were evident signs of irksomeness under its restraint , as in the case of things inhibited which may be of no earthly interest to any , yet the restriction awakens and feeds a desire for the very object denied . The pledge was kept constantly in sight upon the parlor mantelshelf* , and it was scanned and laughed about every day by the congregated boarders . One evening just before Thanksgiving , some half dozen surrounded the grate , with a purpose that soon revealed itselfi , involving the destruction of the pledge , the one for whose good it was intended not being of the party . Amid considerable laughter , one gave the paper a slight twitch , another did the same , a third followed , and so on to the last one , who drew it to the edge of the shelf , when the paper fell over and was drawn into the fire . In vain was appeal made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their act , but it Was turned off with a laugh , and , after months of self-denial , our friend fell away into his old practices . Our venerable landlady had watched the proceedings with deep interest , and schemed to avoid all intoxicants in her Thanksgiving preparation . She had excluded them from her pies and sauces , knowledge of which had got out somehow , and when a bowl of fragrant sauce was placed upon the table , one of the repudiators , a very good man of East Boston , drew a bottle containing brandy from some portion of his dress , and poured it into the bowl ! A shout went round the board at the supposed triumph over those who were loyal to the pledge , but it ceased when three present abjured the pudding as a sacrifice to principle . It was a reproach to the recanting pledgers which they keenly felt , and it rankled during my residence in the house - the object of our care going to the dogs as rapidly as possible . There was a coincidence connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaken an incredulous smile . No one would impute the fact I state to supernatural causes . Nearly forty years after the incident occurred , every one who broke that pledge was dead , excepting the three who were true to it , and in 1890 two of the three were living . I need not say that I was one of the two survivors , as it were hardly possible that I would write the account were I not living at date . I had a young friend , however , who was afflicted with doubt in a case of post-mortem identity . He had been suspended from the revenue service and made a petition to get back , properly indorsed , one of the signers being a distinguished jurist who died a short time before the petition was presented . The petitioner came to me and anxiously inquired if it were necessary for him to state that the name was written before its possessor died I During the winter of i835 I concluded my boarding-house life , and went to the South End to reside in a family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of " the happiest " by and by . Still pursuing my task as a journeyman printer , with an emolument " nothing to speak of , " as the good man said about his religion , the months rolled by , until one day of the following October , when , walking briskly down to my work , I was attacked with hemorrhage , which continued until I reached Beacon street , where my good friend , Dr. N. B. Shurtleff ; gave me something which stopped the effusion . At night , however , it came on again , and the " regulars " were called in ; but physicians were unable to entirely suppress the outflow , and day by day I saw my life-blood diminishing without hope of remedy . At length it was positively announced that I must go to some warm climate or accept the consequences . This was like a sentence of death , for I had no means at handy disposal , resulting from my earnings , and , not being winged like a bird , flight from my doom seemed impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this decree , came a visitor from Demerara , British Guiana , after twenty years absence , who , with means and disposition , prepared to take me back with him . He was a brother of one who was dearest to me on earth , and a warm affinity was established between us , which never relinquished its hold . The condition of things was changed , and hope sounded its loudest note , seconded by my beloved friends , who arranged matters for my departure with the heaven-sent benefactor . The time allotted for the limit of his stay was nearer than my ability to go admitted , but the winter set in early and cold , the brig he was to go back in became frozen in at Hartford , Conn. , and a whole month passed before the summons came for him to join the vessel . Everything being ready we took our departure - a very sad one to all but me . I was sustained by a wonderful confidence and buoyant hope , for I saw health awaiting me and a safe return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was urging me on . The Worcester Railroad was only just then completed to Framingham , the Bos ton station being an old-fashioned dwelling house , then standing where the Washington street bridge now spans the Bostor and Albany railroad , and here we embarked in a little rough wooden car , scarce larger than an omnibus , to take stage at Framingham for Hartford , Conn. , some hundred miles beyond , - a long journey for a sick man to contemplate . Arrived at Framingham , a good augury awaited me . As I stepped upon the floor of the temporary station , there lay glistening at my feet a small gold scarfpin , in the form of a cross , ornamented with garnets around a pearl centre , and I accepted it as a sign , as Constantine did the cross in the heavens , the similar fact of which I was to learn later . Afterxvards , for twenty times during the day , I took out my cross and counted the gems , as devoutly as a nun tells her beads . That tedious ride was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , appreciating my condition , waived all her claim for polite and comfortable consideration , yielded to me the best seat , and , by her assiduous kindness , made the long journey more like a pleasure trip than a race for life . I shall never*forget her sweet solicitude , and her conduct was woven among my young fancies with bright prominence . A snow storm occurred en roule , and it was snowing violently as we reached Hartford at nine o'clock p . M. The lavish comforts of an old-time tavern , more profuse than elegant , soon relieved the ill effects of our journey , and after a sound night 's rest we started by the stage , early next morning , for Middletown . It was a cold and eventless ride , but the hostelry there was good , and after another night 's rest we started for Saybrook , in a close carriage , under the care of a driver as black as coke . He was a bright and cheerful fellow , and sang or whistled , as we sped along , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to next to nothing . " Driver , " said the Nestor of our party , his teeth chattering with cold , " take us somewhere where we can get a good hot egg nog . " " Yes , sah , " replied the sable attendant , grinning as if the proposition were in // EXPERIENcES DURING MANY YEARS . exact accordance with his fancy . The rest of the party acquiesced gladly in the timely suggestion . Nearing an old wayside inn the party got out , and soon a steaming compound exhaled fragrant odors around the smokeclouded bar-room . It was a great effort , and seemed to be self-conscious of its power . There was considerable egg and more of nog in it , and , after partaking about half , we gave the balance to our colored friend , who took it all down without a struggle . From that moment I have never doubted the capacity of the negro . We started again with decidedly improved feelings . The weather evidently was growing tropical , and a smell of Jamaica pervaded the atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside world . We were riding down the bank of the Connecticut , and , scratching a peep-hole through the frost , our Nestor declared that the river-tide was running up ; the other of our party said it was running down , while to me it seemed to be standing edgewise . We permitted the question to remain unsolved , the horses jogging along at a rapid rate , and in good time we found ourselves at an old tavern in Saybrook , when the driver , throwing his reins to a hostler in waiting , escorted us into the kitchen , where a brisk fire was burning , and suddenly fell into a comatose condition so deep , from the effects of his potation , that he had to be carried to his bunk . We were the only guests at the hotel , and for a week had to endure the annoyance of waiting the clearance of our vessel from the ice , which bound her hard and fast at her moorings . Relief at last came . A strong north-wester broke up the ice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brig Alexvzder , of 192 tons , with forty-two horses on deck , and tiers of hay bales on the temporary roof above them , dashed out by Montauk Point into the broad Atlantic . For ten days we had a terrible time of it , the fierce wind and mountainous waves tossing our little vessel about , to our great discomfort and considerable fear . For myself , I felt that , as I was running away from death , it were not strange should he overtake me here in mid-ocean and pre vent my escape , which would settle matters definitely , and therefore I took a philosophical view of the contingency and resolved not to kick against fate , especially as it seemed inevitable . But while we were tossed about almost at the mercy of the waves , I found a certain degree of assurance in the calmness of the sailors , who , in the midst of the most violent perturbation , were constant in their care to have every rope properly brailed , denoting , I thought , a belief in our common safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was luxurious , the Alexander speeding along towards the equator before the " trade winds ; and in eighteen days we arrived at Georgetown ( Demerara ) , the capital of British Guiana . We dropped anchor at midnight , and in the morning found ourselves surrounded by vessels of many nationalities , under the guns of a frowning fort , with the English flag floating from its mast-head , the reveille just being sounded as the sun came up from the sea , and the morning gun sent its note over the waters . We were in the mouth of a turbid river , which flowed , as if reluctantly , into a turbid sea , the waves of which dashed lazily upon the beach . The town lay , embowered in tropical trees , on the left , and far away on the right the river bank was hidden by vegetation , above which , at intervals , rose tall chimneys , denoting the home of the sugar cane . It was a very captivating scene to those who had just left the land of ice and snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a lady passenger on board whom we had never seen , detained in her berth by seasickness , which threatened to be the death of her ; but her curiosity had not succumbed to the malady , and she had wormed from the steward all that he knew about us , to which fact I was subsequently indebted . We were boarded b the custom-house authorities , in whose boat came a gentleman in white , with whom the lady , closely veiled , passed over the side of the vessel into the boat , which was rowed ashore , and she passed from our vision forever . From the light-house , within the bounds of the fort , the signal flag , // announcing our arrival , had brought troops of friends to the wharf ; and , leaving the vessel in the stream , we were set ashore in the ship 's boat . We were escorted by quite a procession of black and white to the domicile where I was to remain a guest for nearly two years . I had improved a good deal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had no recurrence of the hemorrage after going on board the brig . The scene that met my gaze from the deck that morning was most enchanting . The town , beyond the fort , was embowered in strange foliage , the cabbage palm and cocoanut conspicuous , the tiled roofs peeping out through interstices of green - the wide river running a turbid flood to join the sea , on which lay a fleet of merchantmen bearing their several national flags , with a huge British man-ofwar , her teeth frowning ominously , as the crowning feature of the display . On the farther side of the river , rising above a forest of vegetation , appeared tall chimneys , showing the domain of the sugarplant , the plantations stretching away down the coast and melting into distance . A gun from the fort , responded to by one from the war-ship , saluted the UnionJack of England as it mounted to the peak , and I realized that I was in a foreign country , and the hot sun gave assurance of a warm welcome . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully sharing in that accorded to my companions , restored to family and friends ; for great hospitality is characteristic of the tropics , and my illness appealed to their sympathies . " He look , truly , like a biled fowl , " one of my colored sympathizers said as she saw my cadaverous countenance . The first duty of an emigrant , proposing to remain any time in the colony , I found was to enter himself at the proper office , and take out what was termed a " ticket of resideice , " for which two dollars was demanded , binding the holder to perform all obligations of a good citizen regarding the public peace , and to appear twice a month , " armed and equipped as the law directs , " to perform military duty beneath the burning sun . This I at once attended to . A descrip tion had to be given from personal inspection and in the table noting the color of my hair , eyes and complexion , the clerk wrote across the three columns , W ? 1/e . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of William IV. , I returned home to find a " fine fat fodgel wight " awaiting me , clothed in white from hat to boots , who addressed me by name , with the cordiality of an old acquaintance , and asked me as a preliminary question if I supposed people could live in the colony without working ? I told him I thought I should test the matter for a short time - as I had got my exemption from military service for three months , on account of disability - and asked him to explain his conundrum , especially how he knew me . He then told me he was printer to the home government , and of the Royal Gazette , its official organ , and had heard of me , as a printer , from his wife , my fellow-passenger , who had learned the facts from the steward . I accepted terms with him , to commence as soon as I was able , and for twenty months was a compositor on the " Royal Gazette of British Guiana , " published by Baum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pennsylvanian , and Mr. Dallas a light mulatto ; and a more perfect gentleman and a better printer I had never met with . He was educated in Scotland and acquired the art of printing there , in all branches of which he was a perfect master . He was affable in the highest degree and always treated me with a kindness which rendered our relations very pleasant . Upon accepting my conditions of citizenship and perusing the several details , dreading the military service to which I was held , I found a clause in the instrument exempting " apprenticed laborers " from military duty , as an inducement to emigration . This inspired a new idea . Why might I not assume the rSle of Apprenticed Laborer ,  --  and how was my name to be distinguished from the ones that availed themselves of it ? I would try the experiment any how , and felt further moved to it by the fact that my shopmates were continually rallying me about my appearance on parade , armed with a king 's arm gun , wearing a // short-tailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I hoped to disappoint them . I accordingly procured a blank indenture , which I duly filled out , binding myself to Baum &amp; Dallas for an indefinite term , and presented it to Mr. Dallas , without stating my object , requesting him to sign it for the firm . He at first refused , on the ground that there was no necessity for it , but when I put it as a Yankee measure of business security , he fell into the trap and signed , nobody but ourselves knowing about the transaction . I got the instrument duly registered , forgotten among the mass , and waited the result . My exemption expired on the first of April , which was Monday , and I knew that my first appearance as a soldier was to have occured the next day . Early in the morning , as I expected , I was visited by a very beery looking man of a semimilitary appearance , who came to apprise me of my doom . After a little banter about it , I showed him my paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie in my obligation , and I was happy . My associates wondered at my failure to prepare - " the Yankee in regimentals , " a florid figure in their fancy - and when the day actually came , and I walked along the line of sweltering heroes before the printing-office , they looked as if they were expecting an instant trial by drumhead court-martial and my execution on the spot . Mr. Dallas was a lieutenant in the company and was filled with equal wonder , not knowing the effect of the indenture , and I never enlightened them until I left , when they accorded to me the credit of a cute " yankee trick . " I did not feel very proud of it , though , and justified the means .
