New York , Jan. 12 , 189  --  . My Dear Brother : You did well to stay West . Would to God I had ! Julia 's big party came off last night . I told her weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be it must be , of course , and that I would pay all the bills , but I wished it distinctly understood I would n't have anything else to do with it . She assured me that nothing whatever would be expected of me . Unfortunately , she was n't the only woman with an American husband , and that people would understand . She promised me I should have a voice in the matter of cigars and champagne  --  you can know they were all right  --  and I believe the success of the party was , in a great measure , due to them . My having " nothing whatever to do " with it consisted in hearing nothing else discussed for days , and on the night in question having no room I could call my own , my bedroom being devoted to the men ( of course you know that Julia and I have n't shared the same room for years , not since the six months she spent with her married sister , Lady Glenwill ) , my own sanctum down stairs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang around in any place I could find , all ready for the guests a couple of hours before they began to arrive . Of course , too , she finally bulldozed me into helping her receive . You see , the little woman really was worn out , for she had overseen everything . She is a wonder ! There is n't an English servant in New York , or London , either , who can teach her anything , altho ' our second footman happens to have been with the Duke of Cambridge at one time . Not that I care a damn about such things  --  except that the Duke is a soldier  --  but in speaking of them I get to taking Julia 's point of view . I helped her receive some of the people , to sort of give her a feeling of not having the whole infernal thing on her own shoulders . Everybody Julia wanted came , and a great many she did n't want . I suppose out where you live you do n't have to ask the people you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask the people you do want . I have some business friends , first-rate fellows , with good looking , dressy wives , but Julia bars them every one because they are n't fashionables . You ought to see me when I 'm fashionable ! The most miserable specimen you ever saw . I look just like one of the figures in a plate in a tailor 's window , labeled " latest autumn fashions , " and I feel like one , too . Julia looked stunning ! By Jove ! she was the handsomest woman there . There is n't another in New York anywhere near her age who can touch her . They say every one asked about her in London when she went out with her sister in English society , and I do n't wonder . You know she has a tall crown of diamonds  --  tiaras , they call them  --  I 've always been ashamed to tell you before ! She came home with it from Tiffany 's one day , and said it was my birthday present to her , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Duchess could have worn the same sort of thing any better . The young one , too , looked as pretty as a  --   --  whatever you like , only it must be damned pretty ! It was her first ball , you know ; she 's a  --   --  , you know what , it 's her first time in society . She had more bouquets than Patti used to get when you and I were running about town . And she was as unconcerned about it ! She 's fashionable enough  --  I only hope she is n't too much so . I do n't want her to marry this young Lord who 's hanging around , and I say so three times a day . The " young'un " says I 'd better wait till he 's asked her , but I do n't dare . Julia 's fixed on it . She wo n't even argue with me , so you can imagine how determined she is . But I want my daughter to marry an American , and live in her own home where her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : most of these marrying foreigners that come over here want money , and I 'll be hanged if I 'll give the young'un a penny if she takes this one . I mean it . I give you my word . He led the cotillon with her last night . I would n't watch it . I staid in my den and helped smoke the cigars . None better ! I can tell you that ! Well , good bye , old man . If you hear of any thing good out your way to drop a couple of hundred thousand in , let me know  --  better wire me . Politics have played the deuce with my Utahs . Julia sends her love , and wants me to enclose you yards of newspaper clippings about the party . Ha ! Ha ! Not by a damn sight ! It 's enough that I was bored to death by it ! The " young'un " often speaks of you . She is getting togged out to go with her mother and do the town in the way of At Homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to enjoy it , and pity us . Us ! In Wall street ! The Elysian Fields of America ! Can I do anything for you here ? You know I am always glad of a chance . Your affectionate brother , WILL . How about that girl you were running after ? Why do n't you give it all up ? You know what a bad lot she is . Settle down and marry . It 's the only real happiness . Believe your old brother . II Letter from Mrs. Wm . H. Makeway to Lady Glenwill , of London . Thursday . My Darling Tina : It is over , and my dear , I 'm dead ! Only  --  such a success ! Surpassed my wildest dreams ! If you had only been here . In the first place every one of any consequence in New York came ; except , of course , those who are in mourning . There are certain people who have always held off from me , you know ; but they 've come around at last , and were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all their jewels , and you know that always speaks well for the hostess . I wore my tiara that Will so generously gave me my last birthday ( of course he hates it himself , but I brought it home , and he had to give in  --  the Dear ! ) . My wedding necklace , three strings of real pearls , and one string of those " Orient " things we bought on Bond St.  --  no one could ever tell the difference except Will , who makes a fuss every time I wear them . He swears he will give me a new real string if I put them on again , but I tell him we must economize now to make up for what the party cost . My dress was charming . Grace Nott brought it over from Pacquin for her mother , and meanwhile this cruel indecent new tariff came on ! Get down on your knees , my dear , and be grateful you do n't live in this wretched country which is being turned into one great picnicking ground for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay an awful duty , and then , fortunately for me , but of course it was terrible for them , something in Wall Street went up instead of down , or vice versa ( I never can understand those things ) , and the poor Notts went to smash . The dress was to be left in the custom house . When I heard about it I bought it , duties and all . My dear girl , it fitted me like a dream . Did you ever hear anything like it ? Of course , Mrs. Nott never could have squeezed herself into it , so it 's just as well she did n't try ! It is the new color , and made in the very latest way  --  in fact , the coming spring mode . I really think Will 's description is the best . I 'll try to quote it to you : " It begins at the top  --  i.e. decidedly below the shoulders  --  to be one kind of a dress , changes its mind somewhere midway , and ends out another sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but comes to grief and a big jewel , somewhere in the back . The other side , taking warning , starts off in an absolutely different way , color , and effect , and explodes at the waist under the opposite arm in a diamond sunburst and a knot of tulle , on accidentally meeting its opponent half . " It really is quite like that , too ! Will is as amusing as ever . And he was so sweet about the party . Of course , at first , I had to be very diplomatic and get his consent without his knowing . He still hates society in the most unreasonable manner ; would even rather stay at home quietly than go to his club . But last night he accepted the inevitable and behaved like a prince . I wonder how many couples in New York who have been married nineteen years are as happy as Will and I are ? He made a great fuss , of course , about the champagne and cigars . You would have thought the whole fate of the ball depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous price . However , he pays for them , and they made him happier ; so I do n't complain . I am sure , after all , he enjoyed the ball thoroughly , too . You could see it in his face . And what perfect manners he has ! Do you remember ? Will may not be " smart , " but he 's a gentleman , and his grandfathers before him were gentlemen , and that always tells . We do n't seem to have had many grandfathers , my dear  --  of our own , I mean , of course . I know you 've married a wonderful collection of them , dating back to goodness knows when , but it is n't so important for American women ; they can acquire breeding in their own lifetime . I know no other nation whose women can do the same , and even our men have n't the same ability . Look at the American duchesses  --  do n't they grace even the parties at Marlborough House ? Look at yourself , my dear girl . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still you must acknowledge your success in England is conspicuous . Will 's manners are perhaps a little old-school , but that 's much better than the new-school . Young men 's manners nowadays are becoming atrocious , and I 'm sorry to say I think they get them from England . The first thing one knows the only gentlemen left in America will be the women . But I hope American men wo n't lose their reputation  --  deserved , you must acknowledge  --  of being the most courteous men in the world to women . Well , to go back to the ball . Of course , all my feelings outside my guests were centered in Helen . I might as well tell you at once , she is considered the most attractive debutante of the year  --  not by me , I do n't mean , nor by my friends , but by the people who hate us , and everybody . I think she is very like you , a sort of distingue air that you always had . I sometimes wonder if some of our grandmothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have had grandmothers ) , if some one of them  --  hope not two  --  did n't make a wee slip once when royal personages were about ! Of course there is no use boasting of royal blood in one 's veins when it has no business there , but that would account for certain things . You may remember the old portrait of mother 's mother . She looked a perfect duchess . Helen can have a title if she wants it . I might as well tell you now . Please find out all you can for me about young Lord  --   --  . He will be Duke of  --   --  when his father or some one dies ; so find out if you can , too , how long you think it will probably be before he becomes a duke . And is he rich or poor ? He need n't be rich , but I do n't want to think it 's Helen 's money he 's after . I 'm doing all I can to bring about the match , and yet I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine to make a loveless marriage . Helen is n't exactly pretty , but she 's extremely attractive . Her figure is perfect , and she 's the most stylish thing in the world . I am very happy today as I think that I have lanceed her in the best New York can offer . It has not been all downhill work . Her father 's name entitled her to it ; but he hated society , so he was more of a drawback than anything else . I could n't boast of any social position in Buffalo , and it 's extraordinary how well that was known here . However , the fact of my being of a good , sterling , unpretentious family did help in the end , when I got started , and people saw I was serious about " getting in . " Of course , you gave us our first big push forward , you darling . An entree into smart English society does n't mean so much for a New Yorker nowadays as it used to , but it means a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to know when in London , so it is wise to take her up at home , and I , always having Helen 's future in mind , took advantage of every possibility . Perhaps I should n't have had to push my way so much here if the Prince of Wales were still making an American girl each season , but you know for several years now he seems to have given it up . I think he was discouraged by the last two he made at Homburg ; neither of them had any success here the following winter , " hall-marked " as they were , and even London has n't found them husbands yet . Of course , as to one of them , I remember the gossip you wrote me about Colonel  --   --  . But , as you said , he had a wife and other incumbrances ; so the least said about that the better . Under any circumstance , I think it 's a much bigger triumph to give Helen all New York first , now , simply by our own right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early drawing-room , and see what happens next . I shall depend upon you , dear , to see that we go to one of the Princess ' drawing-rooms , and do n't get palmed off on one of the Princess Christian 's or anything of that sort . Helen was dressed very simply , of course , and no jewels , but looked so sweet . Lord  --   --  was devotion itself all evening . Naturally every one is on the qui vive for the engagement , but that 's all right . They danced the cotillon together . We had charming favors , not too extravagant  --  that 's such wretched taste  --  but things we bought in Venice last year , and Hungarian things , and some Russian , and a set of tiny gold things Tiffany got up especially for us . I had several people down from Buffalo , and mother , of course . I wish you could have seen her , bless her heart . She had on all her old lace , and my coiffeur did her hair beautifully . She looked so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quadrille with him , and how graceful and dignified she was . You would have been very proud . I was . Lots of people asked about her , and some seemed so surprised when they heard she was my mother . How rude people are ; and what did they expect my mother to be like ? After all , do I look like the daughter of a washerwoman ? I think not . We might ask the Grand Duke  --   --  , if we meet him again at Aix . You know I told Will about my small , timid flirtation with the Russian , and really he seemed proud of my absurd little conquest ! A convenient husband for some women we know , would n't he be ? Ah , but then you see they would n't deserve him ! Sherry did my supper . He imported some birds from Austria especially for it , and invented some dishes of his own . I think it was all right . People said so , but , of course , you ca n't believe people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was like magic . We seated every one at little tables which seemed to come up thro ' the floors . They were everywhere except in the ball-room ; that was left clear . We 've built the ball-room since you were over . Will bought the house next to us ( such a sum as they asked when they heard we wanted it ! ) and the whole lower floor we made into a ball-room . It just holds my series of Gobelins we bought for that outrageous price two years ago in Paris at the Marquis de Shotteau 's sale . For flowers , I had quantities of gorgeous palms and lovely cut flowers in bowls and vases wherever it was possible . That was all ,  --  I hate this stuffing a house with half-fading flowers , it always suggests a funeral to me , with the banked-up mantels for coffins . It 's horrid , I know , but I ca n't help it . However , if I am writing in this vein it 's time I stopped . My letter is abnormally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stamps will be put on it . Forgive me for mentioning it , my dear , but we always have to pay double postage due on your epistles . I do n't mind at all  --  they are quite worth it  --  only I thought you might like to know . I have all the newspapers about the ball for you , but I will wait till after Thursday and then send them on in a package . I want to see what Town Topics will say . Nobody cares , of course , only you do n't like to see horrid things about you in print . Sometimes it treats me very well , and it 's devoted to Helen , but once in a while it 's atrocious . I 'm only a little worried about Lord  --   --  . I do n't want it to say I am after him for Helen , because I am not ! If the English papers have anything in , please send them over  --  I know some articles are going to be written . If there are any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains to contradict them . The English press seems often determined to make American society ridiculous . Will says we will be greatly indebted to your husband if he will get us a house for the season , as you proposed . Carleton House Terrace , if possible ; if not , use your own judgment , only not Grosvenor Square  --  they make too much fun of strangers who go there . I hope you are well and taking some sort of care of yourself , which you know you never do . And please , if you go to Paris at Easter , be sure to write us at once if sleeves are still growing smaller , if hats are big or little , and whether it 's feathers or flowers , or both . Also , of course , anything else that will help us . And do n't forget to find out all you can about Lord  --   --  . And do you advise announcing the engagement before her presentation , or afterward ? And by no means say a word to anybody , as he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently opposed to it . But I think Helen and I together will be too much for him , and if absolutely necessary my health can give out ! That had to happen , you remember , before I could get him out of 15th street and up here . My love to the Hon. Bertha . How is the dear child ? I long to see you . Say what you like , this society life is n't altogether satisfactory . I think after Helen is happily married  --  to whomever it is  --  I shall drift quietly out of it , and gradually take to playing Joan to Will 's Darby . I 'm sure Will would love it . Love to you both , and a heart full to yourself , Tina , dearest . Your affectionate old sister , MARY . P.S.  --  Do n't laugh at what I said about a society life . Of course I do n't mean it . I do n't believe I could live without it now . I 'm tired after the ball , that 's all . To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . I shall take two phoenacetine powders right away . Do you know about them ; they 're so good . Did I ask you if you went to Paris Easter to be sure and write me if sleeves  --   --  O yes , I remember , I did . III From Miss Makeway to Miss Blanche Matheson in Rome . Thursday . My darling Blanche : Of course I know you are having a wonderful time in Rome with Royalties and all sorts of smart people and gay entertainments , but still I wish you had been at our ball last night . I believe you would have enjoyed it . I do n't think anyone can deny we know how to give balls in America , and mama is a wonder ! You know she 's been fishing for guests for this ball for years . And she would n't give it till she was sure of a list of people who would be present that would bear comparison with anybody 's ; and , my dear , we had it ! And I am sure mama feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been worth while  --  the French chef and his terrible extravagances , for you must pay to be known as a good house to dine at  --  all the deadly afternoon parties , all the exorbitant fees paid for years to the opera singers to sing , the house at Newport  --  and the one at Lennox , the seasons in London , that shooting box in Scotland ( it bored us to death ) , it was all worth while now that we have arrived at the toppest top . And no one could become her position better than mama . A society matron of the first water is certainly her metier . Lord  --   --  is very much struck with mama . I will tell you about him later . Of course poor papa looks a little what that amusing young Englishman would call perhaps 1872 . He was n't in it for a minute ; bored to death , poor thing . You know he hates parties . Thank heaven I am " out " at last , for now I can go to everything that comes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to , because I may marry soon ! I wish I could see your expression when you read that . Of course it is Lord  --   --  . He proposed last night , but I told him he must wait , and propose again in a couple of weeks . I was n't ready to decide yet . I must be free " out " for a couple of weeks at least . He will be Duke of  --   --  , some day . As the Duchess I shall have precedence over Mamie Smith , Gertrude Strong , and Irene van Worth , and even over all the older women who have married abroad , except the Duchesses of  --   --  and  --   --  . Think what fun it would be to sail in everywhere ahead of Mamie Smith , after all the insufferable airs she has put on ! I do n't believe I could make a better match . Besides he 's youngish and good-looking , has splendid estates , and I really like him . I mean I think he is the sort of man you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no real social life anywhere but abroad , and there 's no other life that would n't bore me to death . It 's only natural , for my whole childhood was spent in an atmosphere of searching after it . Ever since I can remember the chief occupation and interest of mama was how diplomatically to get into the smartest set with dignity . It seemed as difficult as the proverbial camel and eye of a needle and the rich man getting into heaven , and in my younger days the three were all very much mixed up together in my mind . I think I should prefer London to Paris . Smart life in Paris seems to be so very much more immoral than in London , judging from what one hears and the books one reads , and you know I do n't care about immorality . I get that from mama , too . She is shocked all the time in the " world , " over here even , tho ' she tries to hide it . Our house looked lovely last night . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough supper and just enough people . One of the secrets of success in society is not to overcrowd anything . Of course there were some drawbacks to the ball , but small things that did n't really count . Mary Farnham came and sat the whole evening thro ' , as usual , without once dancing . Even papa said he " drew the line at that . " Why does n't she take something ? You see lots of things advertised that change people almost as big as she into a perfect shadow in no time . You feel so sorry for her when she 's your guest . I had a great mind to put Lord  --   --  to the test , but I did n't quite dare ! Then Tommy Baggs came and repeated his customary gymnastics  --  waltzed on everybody 's toes in the rooms ( slipper sellers ought to pay him a commission ) , tore two women 's gowns nearly off their waists and spilled champagne frappe down Mrs. Carton 's back ; would have ruined her bodice , if she 'd had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lamb . Her teeth were fairly chattering , but she laughed and said it was rather pleasant . Good heavens ! Who do you suppose is down stairs ? Lord  --   --  ! It 's going to be a bore if he 's coming every day . I shall go down and tell him these two weeks I am to have a complete holiday . Do write me all you 're doing . With love always , HELEN . Later  --  I have accepted him ! He was so perfectly charming ! I could n't help it ! IV From a Guest . Thursday . My dear Claire : I was so glad to hear from you about Florida , and , as you are having such an amusing time , and as the season here is practically finished now that the much-talked of Makeway ball is over , I 've decided to join you next week . Besides , I 've missed you awfully , and it will be so nice to be with you again . Will you be so good as to engage my rooms for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not near the elevator by any means ; not above the third floor  --  but not on the first . Please see that the coloring is blue or pink ; I 'm not particular about design or material , or anything of that sort ( I do n't think people should be too exigeant )  --  only yellow , or red , or white , or green rooms are too awfully unbecoming to me . Have drawing-room to connect with the bedroom please , and then a room for my maid . I hope you wo n't have to pay more than seven dollars a week for her ( all included , naturally ) . She is n't at all particular . I 'm sure I could n't afford to keep her if she were , and she 's such a treasure . Of course she reads all my letters and minds my own business more than I do myself , and uses up my crested writing paper at a terrific rate ; but that one expects  --  do n't you think so  --  with a good servant ? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'll tell you . In the first place it was a great success , and that settles it ! The Makeways are now a power in New York society , and there 's really no reason why they should n't be . His family are all right and her English connections are better ; and then what a charming woman she is ! She makes a perfect hostess . Such tact ! Everything was carried out in the best of taste . If they erred at all it was on the side of simplicity ; and yet that gives you a wrong idea about the ball , because it really could boast of splendor . Yes , I mean it , but of a solid , real kind . There is nothing papier mache about the Makeway house ; nor about its owners , nor about their entertainment . You ca n't help but believe this , and it gives you a sense of social security ! Everyone anyone would want in their house was there . If any line was drawn tightly inside the smart circle , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England as a slightly early-Victorian hostess , or if our presidents had at all the position and social power of royalties , she would be ticketed perhaps as of the Hayes period , except that would imply " Total Abstinence , " which would mean instant death to anyone in smart society , thank goodness ! I suppose you 've heard that old mot of the dinners at the White House during the Hayes administration , that water flowed like champagne ! Well , that will never be said of the Makeways . Their wine was the very best , too ; I never had better at any party , seldom as good , and even John , who scoffs at the idea of women being a judge of wines , confesses , that , though we 've entertained everybody all our lives , we 've never had such a good wine inside our doors . The supper was , in the first place , comfortable , and , in the second place , faultless . ( There was a queer kind of game , which I loathed , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances it was the right thing , so I choked it down . ) The music was superb  --  all the good Hungarian orchestras in town . The cotillon favors were lovely , and some very stunning gold and jeweled things from Tiffany 's must have cost a fortune . But of course what you want to know about most is the people and what they had on . I wore my  --  but you 'll see my dress in Florida , so never mind . Mrs. Makeway had a superb dress , but she always dresses handsomely . What a nice man Mr. Makeway is . You felt sure he was bored to death by the party , and all of us at it , but he concealed it with such charming manners and such natural courtesy that you really felt somehow it was a pleasure to come and put him out . The daughter is a great success ; there 's no denying that . She has a perfect figure , and is very graceful . She seems to have her father 's manners , brought up to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , you can tell that , and apparently she can be an eventual duchess , if she wishes . Young Lord  --   --  is still here , and his devotion in the Makeway quarter is undisguised . Everyone likes him , and says he is n't the sort of young fellow to be merely after her money ; but no one can tell if Helen is going to take him or not . I am sure of one thing , she will do as she pleases . There were beautiful jewels in evidence at the ball . Mrs. Makeway wore , I believe , a dozen strings of the most gorgeous pearls . All real , of course , with their money . They must represent a fortune in themselves . Poor old Mrs. Hammond Blake came with all her Switzerland amethysts , and a few new topazes mixed in ( she must have been at Lucerne last summer ) . She looked like one of those glass gas-lit signs . But really , all the best jewels in New York were there . And it is wonderful to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world have welcomed the revival of black velvet if they have n't the pearl collarettes . I shall be wanting something of the sort myself soon . Woe is me ! And John does keep looking so abominally young . I tell him out of courtesy to me he must get old more quickly , or people will be saying I married a man years younger than myself ! John says I need n't trouble to furnish people with subjects for talking ; they can make up their own . But I do n't think we are gossips nowadays here in America ; do you ? Which reminds me that everybody says the Mathews are going to separate at last . She 's going to Dakota , and get it on incaptability , or cruelty , or some little thing like that . Everybody wondered at first why , since she 'd stood it so long , she was going to divorce Ned now , at this late day , but it has leaked out . Think of it  --  Charlie Harris ! Are n't you surprised ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Harris got the children , so I presume Mrs. Mathews will keep hers to give Charlie in place of his own . If I remember the number he will be getting compound interest ! You know the Mathews babies came with such lightning rapidity we lost count . One was always confusing the last baby with the one that came before it . Anyway , I think Charlie Harris gets the best of it ; so , even if it is n't altogether ideal to possess your children " ready made , " as it were , still Elsie Mathews is a charming woman , and I never could bear Mrs. Harris . She told such awful fibs , and her exaggerations were not decorative ; they were criminal . Why , I could n't recognize a piece of news I told her myself when I heard her repeating it to some one else not five minutes after , as John says . Heavens ! for the third time , " as John says , " I must stop . But I am a very happy married woman ! John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I hear from you I will telegraph my train . We missed you awfully at the Makeways . John spoke of it several times . He loves to dance with you because you are always ready to sit it out and do all the talking . Dear me , I 'm afraid that does n't sound complimentary , but I assure you he meant it as such ! How nice it will be to be with you . You are n't strict about your mourning , are you ? I do n't think it 's at all necessary , way off there . With love , always affectionately , MAYBEL PARKE RODNEY . V From an Uninvited . Thursday . My Darling George : I hope this letter will reach you before you leave Minneapolis . I do wish you would leave politics alone , if they 're going to take you away like this . Believe me , the country can get along much better without you than I can ! When we are married you have got to give them up . When we are married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finally settled , I presume I shall be invited to Mrs. Makeway 's parties ! I was n't asked last night to her big ball !  --  not that I care . I am sure that beast of a husband of mine will never be able to prove his nasty charges against us , and that I shall win the case . Then there 'll be no excuse for Mrs. Makeway and her prudish set , and I promise you they shall eat " humble pie , " if there 's any left in the world after all my dear friends have made me devour . Tom has been making overtures to my maid through a detective , but Lena is faithful to us , and I 've promised her double any sum they offer her . When my position is all right again , I shall go in for society in the most extravagant , splendid way for one long , brilliant , spiteful season , and I shall punish every one of these women who have snubbed me so terribly . After all , half of them owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my family to back me there will be no trouble about my being absolutely reinstated . My people will back me up , too , for we have never had a scandal up till now . We have been almost the only family left . Of course the papers are full of the Makeway ball , and the pictures of Mrs. Makeway are too deliciously absurd for anything . One looks like that one of me in the Evening News when I gave my evidence . I really believe it 's the same picture . I hear that she looked rather well with her famous pearls on ( which , between you and me , I believe are false ) , and her tiara , which all the out-of-town people go to the opera to see . But they say she was dressed entirely too young , and showed she thought her own party a great success . However , what can you expect ? She was nobody ; her family are most ordinary people , the kind that are prominent in some unfashionable church and influential in its Sunday-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancestor of some sort who fought in the War of Independence  --  a common soldier , I suppose , in Washington 's army ; that 's why she has had an office in the " Daughters of the Revolution . " We had several ancestors in the war  --  commissioned officers ; and they all fought for King George , thank heaven ; and if they had only won my father would have been the third Lord Banner , probably , if not something better . So hang Mrs. Makeway ! Her daughter is an ugly little creature ; she has n't a single feature that does n't go its own way irrespective of the others , and with a total disregard for the tout ensemble of the poor girl 's face . You know the sort of thing  --  each feature seems to be minding the other 's business . Her teeth look lovely , but I believe some of them are " crowns "  --  they do that sort of thing so well nowadays ! What I will grant her is a beautiful figure , but my corset-maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of honor she laces awfully ! They say she had the best time of any girl at the ball ; which , if you ask me , I think beastly taste . The house everyone says looked very beautiful  --  of course , money will do everything  --  and the music was superb for the same reason , and the supper not too extravagant . ( I suppose they economized on that ! ) But lots of people I 've met say they were bored to death , and that there was an awful crowd . It 's extraordinary the people she had there ! How she got them I do n't know  --  all the swells . But dear me , after all , that 's nothing ; swells will go to anyone who 'll amuse them . I hear old Makeway looked fearfully miserable , and , instead of paying other women compliments , made love to his own wife all the evening . It 's extraordinary , because he is really a gentleman . His great-grandfather and my great-grandfather were great chums ; made their money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , the Pinkertons have written me that they have still more evidence against Tom . They say she is " doing a turn "  --  whatever that is  --  in some variety theatre . According to accounts she did Tom for a good deal  --  just served him right . Do hurry back  --  I miss you so , and am so lonely . It 's a year and a half since we 've been separated so long as this . Come back . Do n't make me jealous or suspicious . Besides it is n't complimentary to trust me so tremendously . The lawyer is here  --  I hope he has come to assure me of my positive victory . * * * * * He has thrown up the suit . We are lost ! He says Tom has indisputable proof , and that there is no use trying . Can Lina be a wretch after all ? or do you suppose it is your man ? Come at once , at no matter what sacrifice . The Majestic sails on Wednesday . Had n't we better throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of everything , your adoring EDITH . The Plaintiff Two Letters From Mr. John Stuart Kennington to Mrs. Kennington , his wife . From Mrs. John Stuart Kennington , by special messenger , to the law firm of Jordan &amp; Fields . I From John Stuart Kennington to Mrs. Kennington , his wife . Newport , October  --  th , 189- . Suspicion is absolutely foreign to my nature . Therefore , far from a thought of worry when I found my business visits to New York this summer becoming more and more easy to make as far as you were concerned , I used instead to get " a lump in my throat " on the train which left you here behind , believing that your love for me influenced you to hide your own feelings and aid me all you could in the performance of my duties , even at the cost of your own preferred pleasure and at the price of a good many hours of loneliness . Loneliness ! Oh , what fools we men sometimes are ! Yes , and how careless you women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my plans suddenly , deciding I would n't go to New York that week after all , although my bag was packed and Smithers already at the station with it . The instantaneous look of disappointment which leaped across your face , and which for some seconds you did n't sufficiently realize to conceal  --  what a vista that look opened out to me  --  a hellish vista ! And your constrained little smile  --  a sort of conscious visible movement of the muscles about your mouth  --  " on purpose "  --  came too late . That first look had been like a Roentgen ray over the last six months of our life  --  lives I should say , for while you and I were living one life , you at the same time , without me , were living another . Then I understood this summer 's comfortable weekly good-byes , so different from other years ! I think , down in the bottom of my heart , I understood all at that moment ,  --  though I would n't acknowledge it not even in secret to myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my eyes were damnable witnesses against you . I could n't believe them , and doubt if I would have if you had not confessed . Of course , I knew whenever we had guests Jack Tolby was always one of them , and also one of the guests wherever we went , but it only seemed natural . He was extremely agreeable in our house ; it 's only now I realize he has always rather avoided me at the club . I suppose even men like him have some sort of conscience , or at least a sense of decency , if not of honor , toward their own friends , and , if so , good God , how ashamed he must have been every time he had to take my hand ! And you , when you received my lips on yours , already satiated with kisses in my absence ! Ugh ! Kate ! Kate ! how I hate you ! Yes , hate is the word . And to think you are the mother of my children ! That is the big hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is entirely for their sake , not at all for yours . You who have been the first to drag the name of Kennington in the public mud . Three honest generations of us have kept it clean and honorable , and our wives have done the same for us all down to you  --  all except my wife . I used to think that in marrying me you had placed me deeper in your debt than I could ever repay . Ever since the first time I saw you I loved you ; and after that meeting I put my arms about no woman  --  arms that had been free enough before  --  until I put them around you . And since then the same . I have been an absolutely faithful husband to you . Do you understand what that means ? I do n't believe so . I preferred you to every other woman in the world . When away from you , your memory guarded my embraces . Yet I am not a romantic man . Now , for instance , I look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a girl with no money and no particular position in the world ; and in marrying me you obtained both . You have reveled in society  --  thanks to me and my family  --  and this is the return you have made . You have dishonored us . Now listen ; this is what I propose doing . I do not intend to have my children suffer publicly , as they would , especially my two little daughters , if your disgrace were made public . It happens to be with us that a father 's falling in this direction does not so seriously , if at all , affect his children ; therefore , for their sake , instead of my divorcing you , I am going to give you proof and witness by which you may divorce me , for your own sin . But there are certain conditions with which you must comply . I will send by my lawyer a paper , which you will sign in the presence of witnesses before any further steps are taken . In this paper you will agree on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview with him ( this is not an age nor a country of duels ) , and I demanded that he make me the reparation of marrying you when you are free . I must frankly say from his manner I do not judge him over anxious . I believe even a duel with pistols would on the whole have pleased Tolby better . It is true that precedent is not in his favor . His own experience with you will doubtless make him a little uneasy . To continue : You are to marry him . You are to demand of me in your suit the sum of $  --   --  ( and do not be uneasy , you will win your suit ) . This will be convenient for you when you re-marry , for you know Tolby has n't a cent . It will be a real love match on your part , charming ! You are to give all my mother 's jewels to our oldest daughter on her marriage , and all the jewels I have ever given you to our second on hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to have the jewels . As to the children I shall have to submit , in my role of the guilty party , to letting you have control over them ; but I warn you that this is to be only nominal . If ever I find you prejudicing either one of them against me in any way whatever  --  even if I find their affections are being alienated from me by some sort of public opinion or gossip  --  I warn you that when each one is old enough to understand he shall be told the truth . You had better look to it then that my children love me . Your own hold over their affections rests upon it . These points , and a few others bearing upon them , will be set forth legally in the paper which my lawyer will bring you . Kindly send me word if you are prepared to sign , and , if so , when Mr. Jordan or his representative may call . Good bye . JOHN STUART KENNINGTON . II From Mrs. John Stuart Kennington , by Special Messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No.  --  East 66th street . Benj . K. Jordan , Esq . Dear Sir : On second thoughts , after you have left me , I have decided to ask you to write Mr. Kennington as follows  --  I mean I will give you the idea of what I wish said : Acknowledge the receipt of his letter , and say I shall be delighted to sign the paper he proposes at his earliest convenience . I must ask , however , that he submits the document through you , etc. ( the same as we agreed on just now in our interview ) . Now , besides , you must demand for me the following changes or corrections , or whatever is right to call them , in the paper . First , the sum of $  --   --  is too small ; $  --   --  must be added to it . Also , I am not willing to give up all my homes . Either the house in New York , or in Newport , or on Long Island must be made over to me . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my daughters unless I should choose to do so of my own free will . For the other jewels I have no use whatever . You can express that as you see fit . Ask him to let me hear as soon as possible . Yours truly , GERTRUDE CORTE KENNINGTON . Tuesday . The Summer A Letter Grand Hotel de l'Europe , Aix-les-Bains , Sunday . My Dear Mary : Our summer has been a perfect failure . I said in the very beginning if we followed John and the children 's ideas it would be ; but as I was in the minority I gave in . Fortunately we did catch the tail end of the London season . The others wanted to go straight on to Paris , but for that once I put my foot down  --  and all the trunks as well . It was very warm ; still there was a great deal going on , so we did n't mind the heat , at least I did n't . Heat in London during the season is such a different thing from heat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sufficient distraction to take your mind off it . I was doing something every minute . That 's the charm of London . Every hour of the day there is something , and if there ever was a dull interval I dropped into one of the picture galleries . You know you have to do that sort of thing over here . People talk about pictures , and some do it very well , too , and you really meet painters out . The children go and see things that are good for their education , you know  --  the Tower , where Mary Queen of Scots , or Anne Boleyn , I forget which , was beheaded , and the  --  well , all sorts of places like that . The heat made them rather irritable , and Evelyn had a rash , but I thought it was good for them to see all the historical sights . So we staid on just the same till after Goodwood . And the races ended my pleasure , for next we started for Lucerne . I said all along there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do go there , but on their way to somewhere else , or coming home at odd times , and not for too long . There is never really any society there . I knew it . I have had experience with it . Besides , we know the places that every one does go to in July and August . I preferred Homburg , with Aix at the end , but I would have put up with Trouville first , or Ostend , or even Dinard . But no , Switzerland it was ! I hate it ; I always did . It 's too like its photographs . It has absolutely no style . It 's all nature , nature , nature ! The mountains and lakes , no matter how old they really may be , still always have the beaute du diable ; and for a woman of my age  --  who has to resort to art to keep herself looking the slightest little bit younger than she is !  --  it gets on one 's nerves , all this natural beauty ! I prefer some place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make itself up a little with gorgeous hotels , casinos , theatres , and baccarat tables . Mountains bore me , and I hate to go on the water . There at Lucerne the mountains stood continually and solemnly around , just like elderly relatives at a family reunion , and the flat lake lies as uninteresting as the conversation of these estimable creatures would be . And then the people ! The town crowded to suffocation , scarcely breathing space , and yet nobody there . To be sure once in a while one notices an extraordinary old frump go by , who turns out to be the Duchess of this , or Princess that , but I assure you one would have been ashamed to drive in the park with her ( at home ) , unless she was placarded . Now and then somebody decent from New York or Boston arrived on a morning train , but , of course , they usually left in the evening , driven away by the glare , or the white dust , or by the eternal tourists . That man Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen people in the world put together . Sometimes , of course , they are amusing . One day I went to see the Lion ! Do n't laugh . John bet me five hundred dollars I would n't go . So , of course , I did . Fortunately I 'd heard the children explaining it or I should n't have enjoyed so much the following joke . A woman and her daughter , both Cooks , ( tourists I mean , of course , tho ' heaven knows what the mother might n't have been at home ) , stood in front of the monument . " What 's this , Clara ? " asked the older woman . CLARA . Why this is the famous Lion of Lucerne , mother ! MOTHER . Oh is it , ai n't it lovely ! What 's it for  --  I mean why is it ? CLARA . Why , you know , mother , for defending poor Marie Antoinette in the Tuilleries ! MOTHER . Oh , did it ! And then people say lions are such nasty , heartless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! the lion did n't do it ; it 's only put up for a monument to the soldiers who died trying to protect her from the mob ! MOTHER . Oh , I see ; it 's just a fancy picture ! Well , anyway , I think it 's awful sad . * * * * * What do you think of that ? And those are the kind of people Switzerland was full of . Some were alone , and some were impersonally conducted in a very loose sort of way . Wherever you wanted to go they were sure to be ahead , and kicking up a middle-class dust that choked you . The loud sound of their incessant talk echoed from snow peak to snow peak . And their terrible clothes , chosen evidently " not to show the dirt " ( but they did ) , came between your eyes and any beauty of scenery there might be , even if you cared to see it , and I did n't . And then the droves of rich Americans at the hotels ! Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress ? Where did they learn how not to behave ? Those are the questions I asked myself continually , and always gave them up ! I became so tired of hearing of Pilatus and the Rigi , I felt as if one were at the head of my grave and the other at the foot ! I had a sort of indigestion of mountains and lakes ! And there was John ! rushing out every other minute to sit and look at them ( I assure you I was threatened very much with the neuralgia from the damp of the lake terrace ) . And he climbed everything that was climbable , even preferred walking up ; but when there were railways I made him take them for fear he 'd hurt himself . I believe he went to the top of every blessed thing that had any top ! I found plenty of horrid people to look down on without going to the tops of mountains . I tried to drive , but there was n't a decent turnout in the place . I went out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear I 'd be run down by one of the steamers crowded with Cooks . Oh , no ! assez of Switzerland for me ! I said to John  --  " Bring me here to bury me if you like , but do n't bring me here alive again . " And finally , when he and the children could n't find anything more to climb , I managed to move them on to Aix , and here I am . And , of course , the English season has just finished , and the French people have n't begun to come yet , and Aix is hot , and dull , and empty ! Really , is n't it trying ? There are even only second-rate cocottes about , none of the smart ones yet ! I am dying of the blues . Besides I have to take the baths , although I do n't want them , because the only way I managed to persuade John to come here was by pretending I needed them ! When I think of you in Newport , in spite of the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dinners , and your balls , I am green with envy . These are the times when life seems really almost too complicated to worry through . Or course if I were like John 's sister Margaret , sort of half-crazy , who loves the real country , prefers a farmhouse to a hotel , fields and woods to a casino , I might get on well enough . But I consider that nothing short of a morbid state of mind . If you love me , write me soon , and cheer me up . But do n't tell me of too much going on with you , or it will be more than I can bear . If you could honestly say that it was rather a dull season in Newport this year , you do n't know what a comfort it would be . I do hope John and the children appreciate the sacrifice I am making for them . I 'm sure I try to have them realize it . It only shows what we mothers will do for our children . With love , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , as you can imagine , the shops at Lucerne were filthy . I did n't buy a thing except some presents for the servants . At Aix the shops are better , but with so few people here , somehow one has no inspiration . I 've bought literally nothing except five hats . The Children Three Dialogues I. Divorce . II . Birth .

Miss Claire , sliding down from her chair , says " Thank you , " with perfect composure and a conventional smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dance . TOM . Shall we stop here in this set ? CLAIRE . No ! Becky Twines ' dress would ruin mine . And she made her maid give her that one on purpose I 'm sure , because she knew what I was going to wear . But I do n't care . I heard mama say , yesterday , her mother , in spite of all her money , had n't been able to buy her way into several houses . I do n't think she ought to have been invited to join our dancing class at all . When people buy their way into other people 's houses like that , how do they do it do you suppose ? Does the butler sell tickets at the door , do you think ? TOM . Perhaps so ! Butlers look like that . My ! I 'd jolly like to be a butler ! ( They have moved on to another set . ) Shall we stop here ? CLAIRE . Oh , no , not here ! Teddy Jones always mixes us up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squeezes the girls ' hands , too . CLAIRE . Oh , that we do n't mind ! Would you like to sit this dance out on the stairs ? ( She would prefer it herself . ) TOM . No , let 's dance . Come on , this is a good place . CLAIRE . As you please . Do you like kissing games ? TOM . ( Red in the face . ) No ; do you ? ( He does . ) CLAIRE . Oh , I do n't mind . ( An embarrassed pause . ) TOM . I like football and those kind of games . CLAIRE . They are all very well for boys . But I do n't much care for games myself , and , besides , I do n't have the time . TOM . What do girls do with themselves all the time ? CLAIRE . Oh ! I have my lessons , and I walk out with my maid every morning , and I dress three times a day , and then I have visits to make on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new father , have n't you ? CLAIRE .

( They are sitting on the steps of the large piazza of a beautiful country house , the two little girls affectionately close , the boy at an awkward distance . There has been a pause in the conversation , which the boy breaks . ) BOB . We 've got a new baby at our house ! ( Splendid effect ! ) ELSIE , TERESA . ( Together . ) Oh ! ( Their eyes are suddenly bright and their faces glow with a sort of awed curiosity and pleasure , not unmixed with envy . ) ELSIE . What kind ? TERESA . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Proudly . ) A boy , of course ! ( The two little girls ' faces fall for a second , and they are silent , but not for long . ) ELSIE . Of course there have to be boys sometimes . TERESA . Yes , to make a change . ELSIE . Is n't it funny where babies come from ! BOB . Yes , you find them in cabbages . ELSIE . Oh , no ! They come down in rainstorms . TERESA . No , no ! They come out of the flowers . BOB . Stuff ! ELSIE . They do come from the skies , because you know the stars are little babies waiting to be picked . TERESA . I thought the stars were the places where God put his fingers through . BOB . They are n't any such thing ; they 're the gold tacks that fasten on the carpet of heaven . ELSIE . When I grow up I shall have eleven babies , because I have eleven favorite names , and I shall have them all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and there wo n't have to be any horrid older brother and sister , always getting the best of everything . TERESA . And I 'll tell you what ! I 'll have eleven children too , to marry yours . BOB . No , I 'll marry one of them . ELSIE . No , you must marry one of us . BOB . Which one ? ELSIE . Well , I think it would be best for you to marry me and be father for my eleven children . I want them to have a father . I love my father . TERESA . Yes ; but then who 'll be a father to my children ? ELSIE . Yours can be sort of orphans ; they need n't ever have had any father . TERESA . ( Approaching a tearful state . ) No , that 's awfully sad . I want my children to have a father , too ! BOB . Never mind . I 'll be their father besides . ELSIE . Let 's play house . TERESA . Let 's ! BOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two girls ! ELSIE . No , that 's too rough . We 'll play husband and wife .

Now we 'll have a little girl baby , and ( to Teresa ) you must be it . TERESA . No , I want to be the wife now , and you be the baby . ELSIE . No , I 'll be the husband , and let Bob be the baby . BOB . I wo n't be the baby ! TERESA . Anyway , it is n't polite for a little baby to come right away like that . They never do . ELSIE . That 's so ; you have to wait till the news that they want one gets up to the skies . III Death Teddy and Elsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the drawn curtains .

( Sob . ) Now he 's an angel . TEDDY . ( Thoughtfully . ) Do you really think papa would like being an angel ? ELSIE . Everybody likes to be an angel . TEDDY . I do n't . ELSIE . O Teddy ! TEDDY . It sounds stupid to me , like Sunday all the week . Besides , papa wo n't have any office there , and what 'll he do without an office ? ELSIE . Is n't it awful . ( Sob . ) Poor papa ! TEDDY . ( Swallowing a lump . ) Do n't cry ! There is a slight noise overhead . ELSIE . O Teddy ! What was that ? TEDDY . ( Trembling . ) Do n't be afraid ! ( He puts his arm comfortingly around her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELSIE . What is it like to be dead . TEDDY . It 's like school all the time , never letting out , and no recess . ELSIE . ( With another sob . ) Poor papa ! Are you afraid of him now ? TEDDY . No  --   --  ELSIE . Do you want to go up and see him ? TEDDY . No . That is n't him anyway upstairs ! ELSIE . Yes , it 's him ; only his soul is n't there . TEDDY . Do you believe it ? Say , if that 's true , how did his soul get out ? ELSIE . I 've thought of that . This is what I believe : When people die , God kisses them , and their soul comes right out of their lips to God 's . TEDDY . I 'll never play be dead with you , anymore . ELSIE . No , I do n't want to , either . TEDDY . God might think I really was dead , and I might lose my soul . ELSIE . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ; I forgot . I say , Elsie , I 'm never going to be wicked again in all my life . ELSIE . Nor I. TEDDY . Oh ! girls never are wicked . I believe when we die Death comes along and pulls us by our feet ; that 's why our souls go out . They 're afraid of Death . ( Elsie shudders , and nestles closer to her brother . ) TEDDY . Do n't be afraid ; I wo n't let him catch you . ELSIE . Poor mama , she cries all the time . TEDDY . And she wo n't eat . ELSIE . I know where there are some little cakes . TEDDY . ( Eagerly . ) Could you get them ? ELSIE . Not alone . I 'm afraid . TEDDY . I 'll go with you . ( They get down out of the big chair . ) Do we go to school the next day after it ? ELSIE . Yes ; and wear all black . ( Sobs . ) Poor papa . TEDDY . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're crying too . TEDDY . No , I ai n't ! ( Crying . ) ( She kisses him . He is comforted , but very much ashamed . ) ELSIE . Do you think we can go to the circus next week just the same ? TEDDY . I do n't care about circuses now . ELSIE . Neither do I. I do n't want to go anyway . Let 's find the cakes . TEDDY . And then we 'll make a coach out of the chairs , and you 'll drive me four in hand . They go out of the room smiling . Maternity Three Letters and a Cable from Mrs. Stanton , a Widow I To Robert N. Stanton , Esq. , her son ( and only child ) Venice , Thursday . My Darling Boy : Your letter reached me a few moments ago . We were just starting off to see the Tintorettos in the Scuola , but I opened your envelope before I stepped into the gondola , and read enough in the first few lines to let the others go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one in all the world wishes you more joy , more real happiness , than your mother . I wish it more than anything else in the world , and have prayed for it for you every night of my life since you first came into this world . And I 've always counted a wife for you as one of the chief joys of your future . I have always wanted you to marry , only I have always said to myself  --  not yet ; I ca n't spare him yet . Mothers begin their children 's lives by being the most unselfish beings in the world ; and then , as we grow older , I 'm afraid we are inclined to go to the other extreme . I wo n't tell a falsehood and say I am glad you are going to be married now . Forgive me , dear , forgive me ; but in my heart there is still the same cry  --  " Not yet ! not yet ! " Oh , I know I 'm wrong ! It is to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , after all , I was so unprepared , and you are my life , dear  --  my everything . You must let me sigh just a little ; I 'll promise to be all smiles at the wedding . When you first laughed in the sun , and twinkled your baby eyes at the stars I was not a very happy woman . You were only six months old when I divorced your father . ( How much I have regretted that step since . It would have been far better had I borne with him . He was the only man in the world for me ; and he would have come back to me if I had only waited . Then , instead of dying wretchedly miserable as he did , he might have been alive to-day , and we would be companions for each other ; but I was proud and wilful  --  however , enough of that . ) As I said : when you were a tiny baby I was an unhappy woman , with an heart empty and bruised . How I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , nor can you imagine , the comfort , the blessing you became to me ! Your butterfly-like little kisses made well all the bruises ; your little hands , with their soft , flower-like caresses , smoothed away the troubles , and before long you seemed to have crept in , little body , little soul , into my heart , till you filled it completely . And now I must share  --  Oh , we are selfish , we mothers ! for I want all  --  all ! I used to be a little jealous , in those early days , even of your nurse . Do you know , Rob , that I bathed my baby every morning of your little life , so long as you took infant tubs ? I would n't leave it to anyone else ; and for more than one year of your life , in the middle of each night and early morning , I warmed over a little spirit lamp ( I have it yet ) your preparation of milk , and fed it to you , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , if the doctor would n't let me feed you as I hungered to do . How soon it was you knew me . I could make you smile when no one else could ; and what a joy it was to see a love for me coming into your infantile existence . I had cried a good deal before you were born , and some afterward , first out of relief and then for pure gladness . But under your dear influence I gradually forgot how tears came . You almost never cried ; and what a good baby you were  --  oh , a blessed baby !  --  and I tried to repay you by not worrying you with too many kisses , with too much loving , which I 'm sure is not good for a child . Sometimes I had to clench my hands , so strong was my desire to take you up and clasp you tight . Then how quickly you began to grow ; and before long my letters and intimate conversation began to be filled with what " Rob said this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never knew so naively witty a child ! And soon you reached the age when I could play the role of comforter . The knocks and bruises I 've healed by kissing them !  --  do you remember one-third ? I 'm sure I do n't . The many imagined slights of your little friends , which were forgotten on my lap ! The little aches and pains that were slept away in my arms ! How full my life was then ! What a blessed boy you were ! And then those half-lonely years , when everyone frightened me  --  by saying you would be spoiled  --  into sending you away to school . I begrudge those months I spent without you yet . But how we enjoyed the vacations ! That 's when we began reading together again real stories , not those of the younger days . Do you remember your favorite when a very small boy ? We always read it when you were n't feeling very well , or after you 'd been punished for being naughty , sitting together in the great big old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose mother died in a garret , and they were so terribly poor they had to beg a coffin for her , and they alone followed it to the grave . There was a very trying and sad woodcut of the two little orphans doing this , and we always cried together over it . It was n't a healthy story for a small boy , and I do n't know how we got hold of it . Oh yes , I do ! It was published by the Tract Society , and had a moral . It was your aunt sent it to you , but I have forgotten the moral . The football period began in the school vacations , and went all through college ; but still I think you were always more fond of books and music than athletics ; and I was never good at outdoor sports ; I only managed to master tennis so as to be able to play with you . The four years of college had some loneliness in them , too ; but I enjoyed my visits to Williamstown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal again , for I said when Rob comes out he will want to go . He will have at least three cotillon years , and I want him to go in the best society we have . Besides , there is sure to be a wife ; let her be a girl of our own position and class . But the dearest parts of your college life were our four trips abroad during the summer . And then it was that I began to turn the tables , and when I was tired to lean on you , and when disagreeable things happened to let you take mother in your arms and hold her there till she promised to forget them . Then it was when your judgment began to mature , and I found it so clear and good , and have been guided by it ever since . Oh , those perfect years between the day you graduated and now ! How proud I was of you , too , in society . It seemed to me no one was so brilliant a talker at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to my neighbor instead of straining my ears across the table in your direction . And I am sure it was not maternal prejudice that picked you out in a ball room , for it was not I who made you leader of all the cotillons so long as you cared to dance them . Then how more proud I was of you when you interested yourself in politics . I love my country . Your father fought , and bravely , in the civil war ; so did my brother . And I know if such a terrible calamity as another war should befall us , you would be ready . The patriot fights for his country , in peace , in politics , and I am happy to say your interest in our government is as keen and active to-day as ever . Then there is the ever increasing success in your profession  --  have n't I been through it all with you ! Never , I am sure , were a mother and son more sympathetic . The reason I came abroad this year was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . I realized you now preferred staying home with me evening after evening instead of going out . I loved it , but I knew it was wrong . I argued if I went away for a little you would go out into society again , and to your clubs , seeking companionship . It was not good for a young man  --  I said to myself  --  not more than thirty-three , to be spending all of his spare time with an old woman  --  for practically I am that , though you must never call me so ; it would break my heart ! And so , though it was really an awful break for me to do it , I went away , and the only thing I wanted to happen did , only more . Oh , yes ! more than I wanted  --  because I did n't want you to marry  --  not yet ! And if I had n't gone away you would probably never have met this Miss Stone , and you would have been just as happy . For you were happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh , of course , I know not so happy , and not in the same way , but later on you would have met perhaps Miss Stone , or somebody else you would have cared for in the same way ; do n't you think so ? I am afraid , if I let myself , I 'd be sorry I went away . And yet no  --  no ; I 'm not so selfish as all that . If you really have found the one woman in the world for you I will try to be glad . I WILL be glad . I AM glad ! There ! I am . After all it is your happiness . How unhappy I should feel if you loved her and she had n't returned your love ! Yes , it is much better as it is  --  for you , so it must be for me , too . Allowing even for all a lover 's enthusiasm , Miss Stone must be very charming and very lovable . I can see it in her picture , too , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I should have been cruelly anxious to see what she was like . She is very pretty  --  very . I am obliged to confess that . I think I shall come to love her for her own sake , and not only for yours . If only she will love me ! You love me more than I deserve or merit , so do n't say too much about me or she will be sure to be disappointed . If I must be a mother-in-law ( horrid name ) , I want to be a nice one and be loved . I shall do my best . Only it is the giving you up . O Rob , darling ! What shall I do without you  --  without my blessed son ? Breakfast alone , luncheon alone , dinner alone , everything alone ! Ah , I ca n't bear the thought of it ! No ! No ! I do n't mean that ! But of course I ca n't and wo n't live with you  --  it 's very kind and like you , dear , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . You 'll see enough of me , I 'm sure , as it is . And I shall have my memories . Baby and boy , you are mine alone . I did n't have to share you then ; and I wo n't have to share the memories now , and no one can take them away from me . And what if you make me a grandmother ? It is n't at all sure . Everybody does n't have babies now , like they used to . Still , if you do ! Well , I shall probably adore it . But then I must settle down , wear caps , and perhaps revive a widow 's veil . I certainly shall have to be more dignified and not go gallivanting about everywhere , and control some of my enthusiasms , or I shall be a ridiculous old creature . You see , I have always kept your age . Now I must take one awful flying leap to my own ; and then go along with myself properly . I shall have to become much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good thing that will be for me , too , I 'm sure  --  What do you think ? They 've just knocked on the door and told me it is dinner time . I 've been three hours over this disgraceful letter . I knew I 'd been dreaming1 a good deal between sentences ; but I did n't know it was so bad as all that . Well , I 'm going down to tell the others my good news ( you understand that good , do n't you ? ) , and we 'll drink to the health and happiness of you both in some crimson Chianti . And they shall all see how happy I am over your happiness . For I am . And you will see it , too , when I come back ; which will be as soon as I can . 1 The words " and crying " are well scratched over , so he could n't possibly read them . Good bye , my boy . Forgive your old mother if she 's seemed a little cross in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write Miss Stone a little letter to-night . God bless you and her ( and me ) , and fill your lives as full of happiness as your hearts can hold and mine can hold for you ! Good night , my comfort , you best son in the world ! Your devoted MOTHER . Yes , yes , I am glad , dear ; so glad . Do n't misunderstand my letter . Your mother is glad , honestly and with  --  yes , I can say it now  --  with all her heart . II A Cable to her son . ( Sent fifteen minutes after the preceding letter . ) Overjoyed , congratulations , love . MOTHER . III Letter to Miss Lucy Stone , Troy , N.Y. VENICE , Thursday . My dear Miss Stone : So you are going to take my boy away from me ? I begrudge him , just a little , or just a good deal ; but I will tell you a secret . I feel pretty sure that when I know you , I shall be grateful to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter ; and you must love me , for after all if it was n't for me you would n't have him , would you ? He has been a perfect son , and they make perfect husbands . And he loves you , my dear . Oh , if you had any doubts of it  --  which of course you have n't , or I should n't like you  --  but if you had , could you have read over my shoulder his letter to me to-day telling me about it . I am very impatient to know you , but I think we shall be great friends , through Rob , before we even meet . Till then believe me your  --  dear me , what ?  --  your Robert 's affectionate old mother . KATHERINE MILES STANTON . I am sending with this a little old jewel I found at an old shop the other day ; it is a love ring of the sixteenth century . Perhaps you will find a place for it . I send it with my love . K. M. S. IV Letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thursday . Dear Gertrude : You will be very much surprised to hear from me , I imagine , as a correspondence is something we could never keep up . But our friendship has lasted without it a long time , my dear girl  --  forty-two years  --  for we met when I was fourteen . I have n't forgotten yet how the whole school became bearable after you took possession of the other little white cot in my room . It 's a year and a half now since I 've seen you , and I 've missed you . Troy is so near ; and yet , after all , it is so far , too , when we realize how seldom we meet . You must give me a whole winter soon ! Yes , for I am going to be alone ; Rob is going to marry , and that 's why I am writing you . It is to a Miss Lucy Stone , of Troy . Do write me about her . Do you know the family ? Are they friends of yours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't blame him after seeing her picture . She is lovely ( and charmingly dressed ) , and I am sure Rob would never fall in love with any one but a lady . Still , I want to know if she , or rather her family , are really smart people , or what . Even if they are " what , " I 'm sure it wo n't make any difference to Rob , and so it must n't make any difference to me . But it will be a relief to know that they are friends of yours , or even that you know them . I pretend not to believe in class distinctions , and I do n't ; but when it comes to your own son , somehow or other you do want him to choose his wife among his own social equals . Between you and me I am just about broken-hearted . I know it is very wrong of me , but I had sort of let myself grow very dependent upon him , and always had looked upon his marriage much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote and the end of all things . It still seems like the end of all things , but in time I shall get used to it . I feel simply ashamed of myself for feeling as I do now . Of course , if it were given me the choice , " your son 's happiness , woman , or your own selfish comfort , " I would n't hesitate a moment , but it 's so hard for a mother who has spent such happy years with her son to realize that his happiness does altogether and absolutely depend on some one else , and on that one and no other ? And then we always have that terrible doubt ,  --  has he chosen the right woman for him ? Just as if he was n't , after all , the best judge for himself . Of course he is ; and in time I know I shall be able to thank God he made this choice , but just now  --  just to-night  --  it seems to me I come nearer to envying you your childless wifehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sentimental , unreal city , does n't help me any ! Forgive this , I 'm afraid morbid , letter , and believe me affectionately always  --  write me the truth  --  your school girl friend , KITTY . Have they any position whatever in Troy ? A Letter of Introduction Four Letters I. From Mrs. Joslyn of New York to Mrs. Lemaire of Washington . II . The same . III . From Mrs. Lemaire to Mrs. Joslyn . IV . From Mr. Hamilton-Locks to the Hon. Forbes Redding of England . I Letter from Mrs. Joslyn of New York to Mrs. Lemaire of Washington , unsealed and unstamped . Friday . My Dear Mrs. Lemaire : I am very happy to introduce to you Mr. Hamilton-Locks , of London , a friend of mine , who goes to Washington for the first time . I know I am giving you both a pleasure in bringing you together , and any courtesy you may be able to extend to Mr. Hamilton-Locks will be as if shown to me also . Always sincerely , EMILY JOSLYN . II A second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special delivery stamp . Friday . My Dear Mrs. Lemaire : I gave a letter of introduction to you to a young Englishman this morning . I hasten to write , and beg you , as far as I am concerned , to pay no attention whatever to it . He was sent over to us by Lady Heton , a traveling acquaintance , whom we know really nothing of , and it 's been a great bother trying to be civil and everything else to him . I felt obliged to give him the letter , but you will understand by this that you are to ignore it quite as much as you like . He is no friend of ours whatever , merely an acquaintance that has been forced upon us . We hear you are having such a gay season in Washington . We think of taking a house there for next winter . Can you manage to keep out of the political set if you want to ? I do n't mind ambassadors , but I should think all the other people would be most ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball ; wo n't you ? If so , do lunch with me the day after ; do n't forget . Yours , ever sincerely , EMILY JOSLYN . III Letter from Mrs. Lemaire to Mrs. Joslyn . Wednesday . My dear Mrs. Joslyn : Where is your young Englishman ? I adore young Englishmen , and why does n't yours come to see me ? Did you give him the letter ? He has been in Washington a week , is constantly at the P  --   --  ' s , and all the diplomatic corps are entertaining him . The women are mad about him , he 's so awfully good-looking . If you want a house in Washington next winter why not rent ours ? We are going to Rome in December . Yours , always cordially , GERTRUDE LEMAIRE . IV Letter from Mr. Hamilton-Locks to the Hon. Forbes Redding . WASHINGTON , January , ' 97 . My dear Old Chap : This place is a very good sort , rather like a little English Paris ; more cosmopolitan than Boston , I mean , tho ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . The embassy is giving me no end of a good time . I 'm sure I 'm more than grateful to your uncle . I find society in this place is more like European without trying to be , while in New York they try more , and are n't . New York society has an air of its own , and , I must say , it 's a damn fine air , too . Of course , like other places , it has some frumps , and what Blanche Heton meant by giving me a letter to a Mrs. Joslyn is more than meets the eye . But we are not burnt twice by the same flame . The lady gave me in turn a letter to some one here , and I was so afraid I 'd forget and use it by mistake , or leave it at the woman 's door one day when I 'd been drinking a good many whiskeys and sodas and did n't care what I did , that I tore it into bits and dropped them in an umbrella stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me . There 's no use in running any risks . And when a woman over here is stupid she 's damn stupid . So is she superlatively fetching when she is charming . And , by Jove ! but they know how to draw the line  --  all but Mrs. Joslyn . People over on this side think every Englishman comes over after a wife , and at first they pretend to be very haughty and independent , and then if they find out he is not after a wife after all , like your humble servant , they are quite angry about it . I hope you 're keeping an eye on my dogs for me . Love to Millicent . Yours , TED . Wagner , 1897 A Letter from Lady Aires to the Countess of Upham , at Homburg . BAYREUTH , Aug. , 1897 . My dear Rose : Our stay at Bayreuth is nearly over  --  the last opera to-morrow ; and , to be frank , I am extremely glad , although of course it has been perfectly charming . First we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Why they call them a " Ring " I ca n't see yet ; and I do n't like to ask , it gives the musical people who really know the chance to be so superior , and they are conceited enough as it is , goodness knows . Anyone would think it was a disgrace not to have been lullabyed to sleep when a baby by a symphony orchestra ! I 'm sure it is n't my fault if I do n't know which is Schumann and which is Schubert ; and what 's the difference ? ( Between you and me I do n't care . Of course I adore music , but it 's like a great many other things  --  you must n't ask too many questions ! ) Well the first day was " Parsifal . " It 's a dear ! Beautiful , perfectly beautiful ! I wore my white mulle with my green and white hat , and if I do say it ( and I must , for I 'm sure no one else will say it for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't see a better turned out woman . Such a tremendous lot of smart people as are here , too . Really you ought to have come . I 'm sure you would have enjoyed it . Between the acts it 's quite like Sunday in the park . The entre-acts are very long , giving us a chance to shake out our frocks and wake up and amuse ourselves . Some people go up a little hill , or into some pine woods ; but that 's rather dull , for you do n't meet half so many others  --  most everyone stays in front of the theatre . But I must tell you about " Parsifal . " In the first place it is awfully long . And Parsifal himself is entirely too fat ! I am sure such a very good young person as Parsifal should n't have a stomach ! There are a lot of sort of monks in rather fetching pink red cloaks , with pale bluey gray skirts underneath . ( Not at all a bad combination , and gave me an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief is ill , and almost always in great pain , but it does not prevent his singing the longest of speeches . Parsifal kills a lovely swan  --  it flies in so naturally . Really Wagner was a most wonderful man ! Then there is a Gypsy girl ; a sort of snake charmer , who has bottles of things all through the play . I could n't make out quite if she were Parsifal 's mother or what . But she is quite mad , and wears only a very uninteresting old brown dress . I must make this criticism of Wagner : You do n't see many pretty dresses in his operas . Then everyone goes to a banqueting hall , which is also partly a church . The scenery moves along in a most miraculous way and the hall is really very lovely . There are children in this scene , and they lift the chalice , and it glows  --  an electric light in it you know , but it 's really lovely . And the music is simply heavenly . I assure you I cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you why , unless it 's the poor wretched creature ( Am  --  something his name is ; I ca n't find my programme ) . He 's very handsome . I intend to buy his photograph . He has to lift the holy cup , and he feels he is unfit to do it . He is a sinner and wishes he were dead , and somehow or other you feel awfully sympathetic with him . I know the times I 've been to church and knelt down so ashamed I could n't lift my head , thinking of some of the beastly wicked things I 've done in my life . And that 's just what the second act is . A crowd of women try to seduce Parsifal , but they are all German chorus women , and it really does n't seem such a great temptation . But then the girl who was ugly in the other act comes on very beautiful ( but hideously dressed , why do n't they get Worth or Doucet , I wonder , to help them ? ) and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parsifal , and then everything goes suddenly to wrack and ruin . I shall never dare kiss any very good young man again  --  not after that ! In the last act , this same creature , looking more like Act I. , washes Parsifal 's feet . I should hate to play that part , but it 's all very pretty and affecting , and the music  --  well there are no words to describe it . And the whole rest of the act is too wonderful ! Really you have to cry . Of course , it 's too long , and you 're awfully hungry , but there is a rather smart restaurant now , where everybody goes afterward to get their spirits back ; which reminds me that Mrs. Gordon turned up yesterday and appeared at the restaurant at night , affording us a good deal of amusement . First she started to courtesy to the Royalties , who do n't want to be noticed . This she perceived in the middle of her courtesy , and cut it short in a quick way , which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had burst or broken . Then she flew all over from room to room , trying to find a table that suited her , disturbing the whole atmosphere , like meteors are said to do in the skies , and creating the impression , or trying to , that she owned the entire place . She wo n't be happy here , for it is n't easy for anyone else to own anything where Frau Wagner is installed ; which reminds me to stop this gossip and tell you seriously about the other operas . The first of the Ring is the Valkyrie ; you can remember it because of Lord Dunraven 's yacht . And they swim around in the water ; which is , I suppose , why he called it so . But no ; on second thoughts , that is n't it at all . The first opera is Rheingold , and it 's the Rhine maidens that go swimming about . How absurd of Dunraven to have made such a mistake . I like the Rheingold awfully . The first act looks just like water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second act , there are two splendid big men  --  one in white , the other in black bear skins  --  who are rather fetching . The Rheingold is the least sociable of the operas , as there is no entre-act . But it is fortunately a great deal the shortest . I think it is one of my favorites . I seem to know more what Wagner is about in it . I do n't believe he knows himself what he is about some of the time in the Valkyrie . This second opera is awfully long . However , it has two good entre-acts , when you can walk around and talk to everybody ; and I can assure you we have plenty to say after having been kept quiet for over an hour in the dark theatre . The chairs are so uncomfortable , and if you move somebody hisses . There is not much politeness in Bayreuth . We do n't get as good a view of the stage as some people , but we have splendid places ; the Countess of  --   --  is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind are the  --   --  s , and near by Lady  --   --  . So you see we could n't possibly have better seats . For the Valkyrie I wore a new mauve and pale green frock . I do n't think you 've seen it . The bill was atrocious . I sha' n't pay it ; but the costume is a great success . Portions of this second opera are awfully tiresome , first one couple and then another , going on for hours about nothing , but there are some exquisite clouds that move and grow and scatter exactly like nature , only more so , and make up a little for the dull people . I notice one thing : all the gods and goddesses have always such troubles . There is n't a single happy creature among them , not even Wotan , who is god of them all , and wears a silly gold curl over one eye . I think it lowers his whole dignity ; but they make a great many mistakes like that . Of course , one ought n't to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoy the beautiful music , but my nature is so sensitive I ca n't help it . There are a lot of Valkyrie , you know , who wear a sort of antique dress-reform costume , not pretty , and ride through the air on deliciously funny-looking horses . And Brunhilde , the leader of them , a rather nice person , behaves quite like a human being in " Siegfried , " the next opera , which I will tell you about later . In " Valkyrie " you think she is going to be burnt up , but in " Siegfried " she is saved after all . I suppose there is some sort of Biblical idea about hell . You recognized the Bible very often in " Parsifal . " I much prefer Siegfried as a person to Parsifal . He 's not such a very good boy . There 's more an air of athletics , football , rowing , and all that about Siegfried , while Parsifal smacks just a little , I think , of the Young Men 's Christian Association . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it saved Brunhilde 's life , and I would n't mind running a few risks myself to be saved in the same way ! You get perfectly drunk with this music of the last act of Siegfried . Of course , my dear , you know I am now writing about the third opera , " Siegfried . " You must follow me closely , for it 's very easy to get confused about them . " Siegfried " is awfully long , too , and the first act  --  well , I do n't mind telling you I slept a good deal . You see , the theatre gets so stuffy , and then one is digesting one 's luncheon , and the stage is so dark , and I maintain that the music soothes you . I wore , of course , another dress , something quiet , as it was rainy , but I saw no one who looked any better . Between the first and second acts I managed to get a bow and a hand-shake from the Prince , to the visible envy of Mrs. Gordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She flutters around the royalties every minute , like a nervous bird , and as if they were her nest of eggs and a bad little boy was in the neighborhood . I hate snobs ; do n't you ? I am lunching , by the way , with Mrs. G. to-morrow . Quite a big , smart party of us , I hear . That funny dragon comes in " Siegfried , " you know , and of course it is much more amusing here than in Covent Garden or New York . But it 's the last act that I love ! Such passionate music ! Brunhilde falls madly in love with Siegfried , who is , of course , ever so many years younger than she . But it 's just like us women , especially when we are Brunhilde 's age . For I suppose she 's forty something , as she was grown up and went to sleep before Siegfried was born , and when he kisses her he seems to be quite a man ! By the way , Brunhilde was put to sleep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother and father , who are really sister and brother . If you think of it , the story is extremely indecent , but operatic things never seem to be shocking ; music , apparently , covers a multitude of naughtiness , like charity is reported to do . Very likely that 's why Mrs.  --   --  is always doing so much for institutions and what not  --  for her sins , I suppose . I always thought she was a naughty old hypocrite ! By the way , there is a comic character in " Siegfried , " and in one of the others , I forget which , called Mime  --  a funny little dwarf , the sort of thing they put in a Christmas pantomime to amuse the children . Later . I have just come from the " Goetterdaemmerung , " the last opera , and I am completely exhausted . I am as if I were in a dream , and can only think and feel and write of this beautiful , beautiful music and scenery . I am absolutely absorbed in it . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am sure I never could have . I really ca n't believe they felt the thing . Our train goes at 1:45 . Such a nice hour ; one does n't have to hurry in the morning , and can have one 's hair done properly . I have a charming new way of doing the hair . I got it from a Frenchwoman who sat just in front of me in the theatre to-day , and when it was light enough I studied the arrangement till I got it by heart . You want something like that to do during the long duets . Otherwise your attention is apt to wander from the opera , or you get sleepy . To go back to the opera , it began with the same scene that Siegfried finished with , which was rather disappointing , but a real horse came on and behaved as quiet as a lamb , with Brunhilde screaming like mad all about him . I suppose they put cotton in his ears , or something . The scene changed ( without letting us go out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to the house , where Siegfried falls in love with another woman ( Oh , these men ! ) I forgot to tell you , my mind is so full of the music , that I wore my new Russell &amp; Allen winter frock , and I caught lots of people taking it in . But , dear me , how badly the German women dress ! I have n't seen a single chic one among them since I 've been here , I do n't believe I shall come to Bayreuth again . Besides , the music is too wearing . The Rhine maidens come back in this act ! It is most wonderful the way they swim about ! But , as far as I can gather , they are rather nasty cats . One thing I will say , though : I think Wagner 's on the side of the women ; for , in spite of Brunhilde 's being in love with little more than a boy , she has all your sympathies . So has Siegfried , too ; which is odd . I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed so sad . This whole opera is very depressing . We reach Munich to-morrow night at 7 ; and I propose going to the Residenz Theatre there , and seeing a light opera just for contrast . But how bad the shops are at Munich . I believe there are some good pictures , but I think one sees so many pictures in Europe ; do n't you ? I presume you know Brunhilde behaves rather like Dido in the end : nearly everybody , more or less , is murdered off , and there is a sort of Madame Tussaud exhibition in the clouds at the curtain . Of course , I have n't really given you any sort of an idea about it at all . There are no words that will adequately describe it , only I promised to give you a detailed personal account ; and I have done so . The reason we are going to Munich is we ca n't get a sleeper yet , everything is so crowded . Is n't it disgusting . This last opera is rather too noisy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there 's a men 's ballet in it that is rather nice ; not dancing , you know , but singing and posing and walking about , with imitation bare legs , most of them . But I think the best thing about the opera is it leaves you in such an exalted mood . I know I wo n't be able to think of small or worldly things for weeks , much less write about them . Before I forget it , be sure and write me if it 's true that Mrs.  --   --  and Sir George  --   --  are both at Homburg , at the same hotel . I hear they are , and there 's no end of talk about it . But then I find there 's no end of talk about everything and everybody . It is not that people mean badly , but one has to pass the time somehow . I think I love best of all the Rheingold music . It is like a jeweller 's shop window in Bond street ; it seems to shine and glitter and sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , there 's very little chance to display them . Women wear the usual small string of pearls . That 's about all . As most everyone wore one I wear two , with a different pendant each day . I like to be just a little original , and keep my own individuality . Well , now I must tumble into bed or I shall lose my beauty sleep . I 'd hate to have my figure get like these German singers . I wonder why ! I 'd have myself strapped between boards  --  I 'd do something . Good-bye , my dear . Write me all the gossip you can get a hold of . I have n't sent you any in this , but that you could n't expect . It was impossible that this letter should be anything but Wagner , Wagner , Wagner . I wish you could have been here with me  --  you 'd have seen heaps of your friends . Of course I ought to tell you one thing , because I felt it myself : there 's nothing catchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letter A second Letter from Lady Aires to the Countess of Upham . Munich . My dear Rose : It was very thoughtful of you to write me so soon , and Aubrey and I wish very much we could join you , but our money is all spent and we must hurry back to England , where we can economize by making cheap visits among our friends for a couple of months . In December we go to New York to spend the winter with mother . You never go home , do you ? I am so glad you felt you got so complete an idea of Wagner from my letter . I was a little afraid I had n't done the whole thing justice , but I assure you there were many more people there than I thought of suggesting , and the operas , tho ' long , are very delightful . Here in Munich the chief thing is the picture gallery , as of course at this time of year all fashionable society is away and the theatres and opera either closed or giving second-rate performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , and are full of masterpieces , many quite as atrocious as masterpieces so often are . The principal one  --  its name begins with a P  --  is the one we 've been to . I wish you could see the Rubens , or else it 's the Van Dykes  --  I forget which , but they are beautiful ; and when one thinks how long ago they were painted , it 's wonderful , is n't it ? One thing awfully interesting about a picture gallery is to see the absurd difference in women 's dress now and in former times ; do n't you think so ? And sometimes one gets ideas for one 's self . This particular gallery is altogether one of the most satisfactory I 've ever been in . It was n't crowded full of Baedeker people and that sort of thing . In the second room we went in we met Lord and Lady Jenks and the Countess of Towns . That was the room where we saw a portrait the living image of Janet Cowther . We all shrieked with laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother calls an " ingrowing face "  --  it sinks in instead of coming out , so that the poor creature ca n't know what it seems like to have a real profile . It 's extraordinary that there should have been two such faces in the world  --  do n't you think so ?  --  even with two or three hundred years between them . The portrait was painted by  --  dear me ! I ca n't remember , but it was some one we all know . There 's one thing I should n't mind , and that is knowing the lady 's corset maker ; I 'd like to give his address to Janet , because , my dear , in spite of her face he had made the lady 's figure beautiful . I think that 's really the nicest part of a picture gallery  --  seeing comic likenesses to your friends . Lady Jenks and I sat down on an uncomfortable bench without any back and talked away for nearly an hour . What an amusing creature she is ! Has stories to tell about everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your husband got on awfully , and only lived together as a matter of form ! I took up your cudgels , my dear , and told her it was n't true in any particular ; that Ned adored you and was an angel . Of course , he got drunk  --  that I knew , as all the world did , but you were used to that . It is n't true , is it ? He never struck you ? I 'm sure he did n't ! You 'd have told a good friend like me ; would n't you ? Well , just as Lady Jenks and I finished the others came back from going through all the other rooms . We were everyone of us dead tired , looking at pictures is so fatiguing . We decided to go back to the hotel and have tea in the garden . But I think it is a dear gallery , and to-morrow  --  we do n't leave till the next day  --  if we 've any time left after doing the shops , I intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Write to Eaton Sqr. ; the servants will forward . Poor things , they must have had a dull summer ! They say the heat in town has been fearful ! But I do n't think servants mind ; do you ? And then they have the run of the house . I am sure they use the drawing-room and sleep in my bed ! Good-bye , Lovingly , FANNY . Aubrey says Janet 's portrait is by Rembrandt ; but I tell him I do n't think it was by a Frenchman at all , I think it was by Greuze . Sorrow A Letter A Letter to Mrs. Carly , Florence , Italy . New York , Wednesday . My Dear Mary : You were right when you said to me , two years ago , that the time would come when I would realize the futility , the selfish , the absurd insufficiency of my life . It is now six months since I lost my little girl  --  my only child . I thank you so much for your letter ; I was sure you , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people what I suffered and feel still . And it need n't have been  --  I shall always maintain it need n't have been ! She was overheated at dancing-school and caught cold coming home . I was late dressing for an early dinner , thought it was nothing , and paid no attention . From the dinner I went to the opera , from the opera to a ball , on to somebody else 's . I was dead tired when I came home and fell into bed and asleep . All this time , my child , with her cold , was sleeping close beside an open window ! The maid was careless , of course , but it was n't her child  --  it was mine  --  and I hold myself most to blame . In two more days the doctor told me she could n't live . I shall never forgive him ! In six hours she was dead . I think I went quite mad . I know I really felt as if I had wantonly murdered her ; and I still feel I was myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so sorry you never saw her . " I love my mamma best , and God next , " she kept on saying all that last day . One wondered and wondered what thought was in her little brain . " You are mother 's darling , " I said to her  --  " mother 's precious little girl , but God gave you to her , so you are God 's first ! " She threw her arms about my neck and kissed me , and said : " I like you better than all the little boys at dancing-school put together ! " She fluttered about the bed with her arms like a little tired bird ! She made me sing to her . I sang hours and hours  --  lullabies and comic songs she liked best . My maid came to me : " Madame is lunching out . " I was furious with her for coming to me with any such remark . " Telegraph ! " was all I said . " Telegraph what , madame ? " " I do n't care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch a little soul going  --  a little soul that is all yours , or at least that you thought was all yours ! To watch the light of life fade and fade out of a face precious to you , into which you can not kiss the color again ; to watch this little life , dearer to you than your own , slip , slip away from you in spite of your hands clutching to hold it back , or clasped in prayer to keep it ! To sit and lose and be helpless ! Oh , the agony of it ! Marie came once more ; it was dark ; I guessed her errand , and only looked at her . She went away without a word . I took the child out of the bed  --  it was like lifting a flower . At dawn she died in my arms . Oh , were ever arms so empty as when they hold the dead body of someone loved ? And then began the revelations . The stilted letters of condolence , written with exactly the same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and couched very much in the same sort of language . One woman recommended her dressmaker as being the most chic woman in New York for mourning  --  as if I cared ! A great many cards were left at the door with their corners turned down , and for awhile no invitations came . That was all ! Most of the people I was unfortunate enough to meet made such remarks as  --   --  " My Dear Mrs. Emery , I am so sorry to hear of your loss " ( as if the house had been burned down or the silver plate had been stolen ) ; or else  --   --  " Dear Mrs. Emery , I was so shocked to hear it ; such a sweet child ! Which was it , a boy or a girl ? Oh , yes , I remember , a boy  --  a nice creature ; but , my dear , so many boys turn out badly . You must try and console yourself with thinking perhaps you have both been saved a world of trouble after all ! " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another woman came to me , saying : " You poor , dear thing ! I 'm glad you are bearing it so well  --  you look splendidly . Of course you wo n't stay in mourning long ; will you ? It 's really not necessary for a child ; and then I think one needs the distractions of society to drown one 's sorrows ! " And all in such a flippant tone ! There are some who have n't heard of it at all , which seems so strange to me , who see and think of nothing else indoor and out ! And Sue Troyon I shall never forget or stop loving as long as I live . She put her arms about me and kissed me , when she first met me , right in the street , and never said a word , but her eyes were wet . She is a woman and a friend ! So now I am going to join you abroad , to travel and live among pictures and music and real people . These months out of society have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I ca n't stand it . The inanities of an afternoon At Home are more than I can bear . Everybody repeating to each other the same absurd commonplaces over and over again . Society conversation in one way is like a Wagner opera : it is composed of the same themes , which recur over and over again ; only , in the conversation referred to , these themes are deadly , dull , fatuous remarks . As for balls and evening parties , I do n't care about dancing any more , somehow , and to see the young debutantes about me almost breaks my heart , full of memories of my daughter and what she might have been . Tears are not becoming to a very low-necked dress , and should n't be worn with powder and jewels . No , my dear Mary , I see in this society of ours , we all grow so hardened , that if we do n't have some such grief as I have had , we become hopeless . People soon forgot I had ever had a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years . I find myself becoming a bore , because of perhaps a certain lack of spirit that I used to have ; and I began to realize that I had never been liked for myself , but for what I gave , and for the atmosphere of amusement which I helped to create by nearly always being gay and enjoying myself . As you yourself said of society , it is absolutely unsatisfactory . I never knew a purely society woman yet who was n't somewhat or sometimes dissatisfied . First , they ca n't go as much or everywhere they want ; and soon after they have all the opportunities they desire , they find that is n't sufficient , after all , to make life perfect , and then the boredom of fatigue begins to creep upon them with the years , and soon old age begins like a worm to eat into what happiness they have had . Oh , no ! When I think of how full your life is , of the interesting people you know  --  not merely empty names with a fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the places you see and the books you read ; and then hear you say your life is too short to see or enjoy a third the world has to offer you ! You happy , happy woman you ! Well ! The house is for sale ! What furniture I want to keep stored ! John , who is prematurely old and half-dead with trying to earn enough money to keep us going as we wished in New York , has entered into it all in exactly my spirit . He has sold his seat on the stock exchange . He has disposed of all his business interests here . We find we have quite enough income to travel as long as we like , moderately , and to live abroad for as many years as we please . When we get homesick  --  as we are both sure to , for after all we are good Americans  --  we will come back here and settle down quietly in some little house , near everybody , but not in the whirlpool  --  on the banks of society , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can go and paddle in it for a little , just over our ankles . Two weeks after you receive this letter you will receive us ! We sail on Kaiser Wilhelm to Naples . No one here knows what to make of us ! It 's absurd the teapot tempest we 've created . The verdict finally is that we 've either lost our money or else our minds ! With a heart full of love , Affectionately , AGNES .

A charming , delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , with a perfect mail . No nasty business letters from America , but only most desirable invitations , notes full of gossip , and regrets from the Thompsons for the expensive dinner I felt obliged to give them at Armenonville , so I wo n't have to give it ! One 's old friends in America are really rather a bother , coming to Paris in the very middle of the season . If they came only in midsummer , when every one is away , one would be very glad to do what one could , if one were in the city . Of course , as far as the Thompsons themselves are concerned , I love them . My coffee never tasted so deliciously , and Marie said I looked unusually well after my night 's rest . To be sure Marie says that every morning ; but never mind , it is always pleasant to hear the first thing one wakes up , and I only wish I did n't have a sneaking fear that the new Empire pink bed-hangings help a good deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret ; no one else has it ) , laved my face in rose-water , and then I had a wee little nap by way of a starter for the day . After my bath I answered my mail ; and then , Marie having manicured my nails , my toilet was made . I wore , to go out , my striking blue costume , with the hat and sun-shade to match , which always necessitates the greatest care with the complexion . I use an entirely different powder with this dress , and one has to be most careful about one 's cheeks . But Marie is invaluable so far as the complexion is concerned , and I went out quite satisfied . First , to the hair-dresser 's to have my hair re-dyed , as I went to the races in the afternoon , and the light there is very trying . Unless your hair has been dyed very lately it is quite useless to go . My hair was never done so well . I am trying it a very little darker , and I am almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shops . I think it is always a good thing to have one 's carriage seen waiting outside the smart shops often . I priced a great many things , and had several  --  which I of course have no idea whatever of buying  --  sent home on approval . To the dressmaker 's , to try on my new dress . It was finished ; but did n't suit me . I am having entirely new sleeves and all the trimming changed . I persuaded them it was their fault . I had really thought I should like it that way until I saw it completed . Then to breakfast with the Countess of  --   --  ; a charming dejeuner . All the women very desirable to know and very chicly dressed , and not one looking so young for their age , I am sure , as I. In fact , several made that remark to me . I know they say just the opposite behind my back , but it is pleasant to hear nice things under any circumstances . I think it is all one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our faces . I left dejeuner first , because that makes a good impression , as if you are crowded with engagements , and flatters your hostess , who is naturally pleased to catch a much-sought-after guest . I really drove home to rest a little before the races . I find taking off everything and indulging in complete relaxation , if only for ten minutes , is wonderfully refreshing , and saves lots of lines ! While I was resting my masseur came and gave me face massage . There is nothing like it for a wrinkle-destroyer . And the man is a rather nice person who amuses me . I got him two new clients at the luncheon today . As the other women said , one is only too willing to pay extra to get a man who is good-looking . The races were very exciting . It was a lovely day , our coach had a fine position , and our party was much stared at ! I had the most conspicuous seat , and did my best to become it . It is n't for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I owe it to my dress-maker to make the statement that no one else had on a better gown . I wish that statement was the only thing I owed him ! I won forty louis ; I do n't know how . I am absolutely ignorant about horses . I only go because it seems to be the thing to do now . But I thought one of the jockeys looked rather fetching , and so I put my money on him , and he happened to win . We all went for tea to Mrs.  --   --  ' s , where one of the most expensive singers sang . But I did n't hear her , because if you go into the music room you have to sit down in rows , and you do n't see any of the people . I was obliged to hurry away , as my appointment with Jacques to-day was for 6:30 , and I wanted to stop at an imitation jeweller 's place in the rue de la Paix , where I had heard were some wonderful paste necklaces . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never tell a soul it 's not real . I was late home , but Jacques , the dear boy , was waiting , and seemed to me sweeter than ever this afternoon .

I know he is much younger than I , and all that , but he 's so sweet , and , after all , I have enough money for two . The Westington 's " Bohemian Dinner " A Letter The Sherwood 58 West 57th St. My Dear Dora : We are just home from dining in one of the smartest houses in New York , and I 've been bored so wide awake I ca n't think of going to bed , so I am sitting in my petticoat ( that charming white silk , much-festooned , and many-flounced one you brought me over from Paris ) and a dressing sack ( pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , but Dick does n't paint it any more  --  it 's getting thin , dear !  --  and I 've nice little swansdown lined slippers over my best white silk-stockings . I 've worn to-night the best of everything my wardrobe affords , and I was n't ashamed of myself ! No , I was much more ashamed of the Westingtons , and I 'm going to tell you all about it before I touch the pillow ! I 'm sure you 'll be amused . In the first place , to be honest , we were rather pleased to be asked . There is no one smarter than the W. 's , and , besides , they are attractive and good-looking . The truth is , we 've always been anxious to go to their house  --  heaven knows why , now that we 've been . We are sufficiently punished , however , for being so foolish as to be flattered by our invitation . For , my dear , we were n't asked to a swell dinner at all ; we were invited to what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a dull and ungainly one ) , and it was apparently taken for granted that , as Dick painted and I had n't millions , we were decidedly eligible . Of course , as you know , there is no such thing as a real Bohemia in New York . The dinner was given in honor ( apparently ) of the Hungarian pianist Romedek and his wife . He has been an enormous success here this year , and society has taken him up . But the trouble is with Madame Romedek ; no one is sure she is Madame Romedek , and a great many people are sure she is n't . She is a pretty , rather common-looking person , with no particular intelligence or esprit . I am told she is more communicative under the table than she is over it ; and I know some men are crazy about her . Of course , she is n't a woman any of us can stand for a moment . If Romedek were a painter we should know she 'd been his model , and be awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great one  --  I wish you could hear him ) ; and they say she has n't even the social prestige or poetic license of having been an artist 's model , but of having been something quite wrong to begin with . Naturally , you see , some of society wo n't have her at any price . Those that must have him have difficulty in entertaining them . I hear one prominent woman who was asked last week to dine and meet the Romedeks considered herself insulted , and has struck her would-be hostess ' name off her visiting list . So you see it was n't all plain sailing with the Westington 's , and I can hear them decide between themselves to give a " real Bohemian dinner ; " that is , ask people who " do things , " and whom you sometimes do meet out at houses where they are not particular about mixing  --  the kind of people who would probably not take offense at being asked to meet Mrs. Romedek without having her marriage certificate for their dinner card . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being asked to meet anybody . Thank goodness ! I feel perfectly secure about my reputation , and also about my position , which is quite good enough to please me . But there is a difference in being asked to meet a questionable person because that person is brilliant , or beautiful , or talented , and that therefore you ( belonging to the aristocracy of brains ) will appreciate her , and , on the other hand , being asked to meet her because you are an artist 's wife and do n't mind that sort of thing . We do mind it very much ! We do n't even care for it in geniuses  --  only we overlook it in a genius ; disregard it as not being our affair . But to be asked to meet a silly , loose woman with the idea that I wo n't mind , almost as if I approved , I resent that . However , let me tell you who was there . On Mrs. Westington 's right , of course , sat Romedek , and he is very handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westington enjoyed her dinner if nobody else did . On Mrs. W. 's left was Mr.  --   --  , who is , you know , a great swell here and who poses as being a fast patron of the arts and graces  --  especially the graces  --  after the pattern of a Frenchman who has his entree behind the scenes of the opera . His wife never accepts invitations that he does ; they meet , you know , under their own roof , for the sake of the children  --  but under their own roof only . So in her place Belle Carterson was asked , who has gone in for keeping a swell florist 's place , and they say is making money . She is independent , and I like her , but of course it is considered by her friends in society that since she went in for business she ca n't refuse to meet anyone . Dick sat next to her , and had on the other side of him Mrs.  --   --  , who likes celebrities without the knack of selection , and whose invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kept open as long as possible to see if something better wo n't turn up . Then came Mrs. Romedek and Mr. Westington ; he looking bored to death , and she as if she did n't know where she was at . Then Bobbie Lawsher , who writes books and operettas and things  --  rather amusing he is , but becoming more and more of a snob every day . It 's bad enough to see a woman straining every nerve to get into society , but when you see a man it 's worse than ridiculous . I met him at a smart party the other night , and he stuck by me for hours , asking who everybody was till I lost my patience and told him I could n't be a Blue Book for him or anybody , and he would either have to dance with me at once or go to some one else with his questions . I never knew any one who could bring in the names of as many smart people in one short remark as Bobbie can . If you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a wager that , in his answer , in a perfectly natural way , he will mention familiarly three smart society women ( calling one at least by her first name ) . Of course he does get asked a great deal , because he 's little more than a snub-cushion  --  holds any amount of them as easily as pins . Besides he goes to afternoon bores , like Teas and At Homes and Days , for which free and untrammelled men can only be obtained by subterfuge and trick or some extraordinary bribe . To a young man like Bobbie Lawsher afternoon affairs are a sort of happy hunting ground , a social grab bag , where he can never be sure there is n't a dinner invitation , or one for the opera , or a luncheon , to be secured if one is clever and careful . Why , when a woman has a man guest back out at the last moment from a dinner , the first thing she does is to rush off to any At Home , that 's going on , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him fill her vacancy . Bobbie has accomplishments of a certain sort , can sing a pretty little song in a pretty little way , and can pass a tea cup without spilling , and drink tea himself , and can hang around when he 's wanted , and be got rid of easily when he is n't . He is a sort of society errand boy , and very useful . I take it back about his having accomplishments  --  a better word for them is conveniences ! Well , on the other side of Bobbie was Mrs.  --   --  , red in the face , so angry she was asked to meet Madame Romedek , talking with poor Bobbie in a sharp , spasmodic sort of way , as if she were carrying on the conversation with her knife and fork , cutting the sentences into bits , some ignoring and some eating ,  --  and none agreeing with her , or she agreeing with none . Then George Ringold asked , I suppose , for me . I am quite aware that women who are indiscreet themselves think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George and me . I am very fond of him , and so is Dick . And he has kissed me , and Dick knows it ; but I am sure I need not tell you that is all . On the other side was Romedek , and perhaps I ought to feel complimented , but as , thanks to Mrs. Westington , we did n't succeed in carrying on to a finish any single conversation we started , I do n't allow myself to be too flattered . Mrs. W. talked music , of course  --  the commonplaces of it  --  such as any well-bred , smart , educated woman of the world knows how to talk nowadays , with perhaps just one good , big , absurd mistake thrown in ,  --  thus , by the grace of humor keeping banality from becoming absolutely fatal . Madame Romedek was rather amusing . She tried to be the lady  --  which , as she does n't know how , and only succeeds in being impossibly stupid , must have bored the men on each side of her tremendously . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . If they would make the best of the bargain , and be frankly a common cocotte gone right , they would certainly be more amusing , and might have something like success , at any rate with the men . The food was excellent , the wine good , the house lovely ! And as soon after dinner as was at all decent , we left . We decided in the cab on our way home , from no point of view had it paid ,  --  financially least of all ; for our dinner in the restaurant , with all our jolly friends , would have cost us only seventy-five cents , while our cab bill for the evening was three dollars . As for having had a good time , there was only one person there who had that  --  Mrs. Westington herself . I believe even the servants must have been bored by the dinner , unless , perhaps , Madame Romedek flirted with them ; which I should think extremely likely . I am getting sleepy now , of which fact my letter undoubtedly bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams to you , and none to me  --  I do n't like them ! Write me what you are doing in Paris . I am sure your husband will have his usual great success in the Champ de Mars . We are all very proud of him . With love , dear Dora , GUENNE BARROWS . The Gamblers I.

( She asks the gentleman to place a third louis for her . In doing so the chip rolls from his fingers ; he immediately recaptures it and places it properly . ) Monsieur , monsieur , if you please . Return me my louis , if you please ! I never play a louis that has rolled on the table . That would bring us bad fortune , you would see ! Thank you , thank you very much .

O yes , yes , we will be paid ! All the better ! Two louis for me if you please , thank you . Monsieur , I am sorry to trouble you to give me my four louis ! No , no , you have n't given me enough !
