txt Our wheat crop , raised mostly in the States of Illinois , Kansas , Iowa , Nebraska , Wisconsin , Minnesota , the Dakotas , and . Michigan , ran up last year to the great total of 600,000,000 bushels . One year ago the advocates of silver free coinage looked to these States for firm support . They were jubilant about the sentiment in the Northwest , and sound money men were apprehensive . And one year ago the State of Kansas was in a state of most violent political ferment . INGALLS had sunk to the bottom , and out of the depths had come strange , formless , unclassified creatures , PREFER and SntiipsoN , yeasty accidents or a new product ? no one could say which . The Democrats of Wisconsin on Wednesday adopted a perfectly sound financial platform . They oppose free and debased silver coinage as dishonest . They insist that all dollars in the currency shall be of equal intrinsic value . In Nebraska the other day the Democrats repudiated a free-silver plank . In Michigan the silver men received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Northwestern States is extinct . Kansas , too , is tranquil . PEEPER and SiniPsoic are the two most inconspicuous persons in Congress , and JOHN J. INGA.LLS is beginning to stir about . Hope springs afresh in his bosom . There is an obvious , indisputable , and interesting relation between the big wheat crop and the subsidence of the silver craze , between the restored prosperity of the Kansas farmer and his diminished interest in third party movements . But . in the Southern States 8,652,579 bales of cotton were raised last year ? by more than a million bales the largest crop ever raised  --  and there the free-coinage mania rages unabated , if we may believe the propagandists , and the schismatic Alliance has thousands of solemn and active sectaries . The paradox is only apparent . When the granaries of the Northwest were bursting , the granaries of Europe were lean . Our surplus wheat was taken over the Atlantic at high prices . The South 's cotton crop , on the other hand , was too big for the world 's need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ruled for many months . The great crop at low prices brought loss and . ruin to the South . The priests of the greenback and of the sixty-five-cent silver dollar have been tireless in teaching our people that the cure for debt is more currency . The acceptance of that doctrine has made ardent free-coinage men of the impoverished cotton planters and those dependent on them , to the unspeakable delight of Senator JONES and Mr. TELLER . Dispatches to THE TIMES of Wednesday stated that the reduction in cotton acreage in South Carolina this year would be trom 25 to 50 per cent . The farmers propose to raise their own corn and other farm crops for feeding , and to treat cotton as a surplus crop . From other parts of the South we hear similar reports . If these intentions are carried out , we may read next year a sound money resolution in the platform of the Texas Democrats , Georgia may reject a free-coinage plank , and South Carolina shake off Tiuzi. &N; and the Farmers ' Alliance .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
