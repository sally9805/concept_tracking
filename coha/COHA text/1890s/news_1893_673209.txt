txt aqueduot , it wea deoided to wipe out the vila laces of Kirbyville and New-Castle Corners , ' each about a half mile from Mount Kisco , ' and also an outlying negro settlement . There are about a dozen dwellings in each of the three places . After looking over Mount Kisco , Commis- ' sioner Daly said that a corps of Sanitary In- ' specters would be kept there all Summer . From Mount Kisco the party proceeded to Katonah . The Commissioner had not been there before , and as there was some talk of hostility on the part of the villagers , Mr. Pugsley and his ferocious outfit were taken along for backing . Katonah was not in warlike paint . The storm may have had something to do with it . but a boy with a cheese sandwich in one hand and Storekeeper J. M. Lyon with a smile and an . umbrella were the only signs of activity at the station . Mr. Lyon took Mr. Daly and his party under his wing , and introduced them to several other staid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its whistle at the curve . They greeted the Commissioner and his companions with quavering voices , and then Mr. Lyon , acting as guide . led the procession down . a lane and through a barnyard to Cross River , , a dark and turgid stream . Several other staid . citizens joined the procession at cross streets , and windows flew up and laces were pressed against the glass as the party wended its way in the snow and down the hill to the brook . Mr. E. Wegmann . Jr. , the resident engineer of the aqueduct , showed the Commissioner and his party a dirty stream of water flowing into the creek as the drainage of the town , and after a brief tour Mr. Daly and Dr. Edson decided that the town would have to go . The population is 500 , there are seventy-five houses , and nearly all of the town is down along both sides of the creek . There are many handsome cottages or hew-Yorkers lining the water . On one side of the creek is the handsome house or ex-Collector of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town practically , everything will be destroyed .. Only a few houses high on the hillside will remain , and the " dead line " will come almost up to the railroad station . In dealing with Katonah , Commissioner Daly departed from his custom . The site of the town bad already been marked oy the Aqneducs Commissioners for use when the Cornell dam was finished , but condemnation proceedings were not being pushed , and the inhabitants were expecting to remain for several years . Instead of ordering the destruction of the place in ten days under the new law , Mr. Daly and Dr. Edson decided on a compromise by ? which the condemnation proceedings authorized under the old law will be pushed with all possible haste . Lawyer Dykman said last night ; that the town would be put up at auction by June 15 , and would bo moved away or destroyed a few days later . Meanwhile the Public Works Commissioner will take charge or the sanitation of the town , and will do away with existing evils as far as possible . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now Katonah will be deep under water . This dam will be backed by a lake 4,000 acres in extent . " The water , " said Dr. Edson , after leaving Katonah , " is already growing better as a result of our raids , and this Summer it will be purer than ever before . " ?
