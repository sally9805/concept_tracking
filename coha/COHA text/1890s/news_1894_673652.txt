txt The announcement that the Andorrans have determined to throw off the yoke of France and to declare and maintain their independence is calculated to produce a sympathetic thrill in the American bosom , without reference to the incidental questions how they came to be under the French yoke , what the burden of that yoke is , who the Andorrans are , and where Andorra is . The announcement , as we have given it , is indeed not precisely accurate . The fact seems to be that it is the Bishop of Seo de Urge ! who has determined to throw the French yoke off from his Andorrans , the French yoke being a suzerainty that has existed since 1278 and been acquiesced in by the Bishop of Urge ! . But after 616 years that prelate finds that he can no longer endure the yoke . Stimulated , perhaps , by the example of the King of Corea , he gives out , in a pastoral letter , that he rejects the French suzerainty , and that henceforth he proposes to tax and govern the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andorrans feel about it is not known , nor perhaps is it material . There are fewer than 7,000 of them , and they are all good Catholics . The probability is that they do not think or feel about it at , all . Andorra is one of the queer little anomalies that used to be so much more common . tn Europe than they are now , since the unification of Italy and the unification of Germany . Geographically , it is a saucer at the top of the Pyrenees , lying between France and Spain , containing fifteen square miles , and inhabited , as aforesaid , by some seven thousand people addicted to pastoral pursuits and to smuggling , for which the saucer , by situation and surroundings , is admirably adapted . In fact , while the Bishop of Urgel , Whieh IS the nearest cathedral City on the Spanish side , and ' in whose diocese the Andorrans are , directly derives in episcopal revenue but $192 yearly from Andorra , it is conceivable that by winking at smuggling , as prelates have been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the income he receives from the churches of Lerida . It does not clearly appear why the Bishop should all at once have grown so restive under the French yoke . The dual Government does not seem to be a very admirable contrivance for the regulation of an enterprising community . But the Andorrans , whatever else may be charged upon them , are not enterprising . The magistrates are also the commanders of the militia . of which Andorra has a force of 600 , and on their off days they are police magistrates , deciding the cases that come before them , with no regard to written law , for there are no written laws in Andorra . One of them represents the Bishop and the other the French Republic . It may be assumed that they are not overworked , since the chief breaches of the public peace are stabbing affrays , which are settled out of court by arrangement with the priests of the six parishes into which Andorra is divided . There is another system of civil jurisprudence , also dual . The appellate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republic , and an appeal lies from the former to Urgel and from the latter to Paris . The " patronage " of Andorra does not seem worth fighting for . A district leader would disdain it . Neither is France like-1y to climb the Pyrenees and surround the saucer for the sake of securing $192 a year to the Treasury of the republic . But it may be suspected that the Bishop has ulterior views . Perhaps the laurels of Prince Albert of Monaco will not suffice the good Bishop , and he dreams of establishing a health resort in the Pyrenees that may bring him in some of the revenues of Monte Carlo . At any rate , he has an admirable site for a lottery , and the Church in Spain does not oppose lotteries . This seems to afford a great opportunity for the Louisiana Lottery Company , which does not find itself altogether happy in its precarious lodgings in Honduras and Florida . Perhaps it is the lottery people that have put the Bishop up to defying France . At any rate , an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the ideal site for a lottery company , and the Louisiana people should , at once approach the Bishop in a spirit of conciliation and generosity .
