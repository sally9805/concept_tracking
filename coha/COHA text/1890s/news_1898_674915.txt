txt A week ago tonight a dispatch to THE TIMES stated that Ambassador Hay was being considered as the successor of Secretary of State Day . To-day the announcement is made and not contradicted by the Administration that Col. Hay has accepted the place and will occupy it as soon as Secretary Day retires from the office . Some of the reasons that led the President to regard Mr. Hay with great favor were given at that time . His diplomatic training , his skill in managing all diplomatic matters that have been intrusted to him , and his tactfulness in Great Britain at a period when it is highly important that feeling between the two nations should be supported with dignity and unquestionable sincerity , had indicated his quality as a man for the emergency , and his correspondence with the President touching the preliminary efforts of the Spanish Ambassador at London to bring about peace negotiations made him a specially valuable man at a very critical moment . It was through Mr. Hay that the President became aware , before the appearance at the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request to learn the term. ; of peace of the United States , that such a visit might be expected at an early day . Mr. Hay thus obtained a very complete insight into the controversy and the expectations of the Spanish Government , and this familiarity with a subject that may occupy the attention of the Department of State for a considerable time doubtless helped the President to the conclusion to ask Mr. Hay to join his Cabinet . There seems to be little doubt that Mr. Whiteiaw Reid will go to London to take the Place of Ambassador Hay . This will be a promotion for Mr. Reid . When he was at Paris he was Minister . At the Queen 's jubilee ' he was special envoy , but he made many friends hi London as the representative of the United States , and was shown distinguished honors on that festival occasion . His task will be a difficult one , as the tone of comment of the London press on Mr. Hay 's withdrawal must convince those who read it . The President is understood ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there does not appear to be any reason to look for resistance to his confirmation from Senator Platt . Mr. Platt has repeatedly asserted , recently , that he does not now attempt to prevent the doing of everything that he can not heartily approve of , but takes what the can get and tries to be satisfied with those things which do not fully commend themselves to his judgment . The President does not take the halfhearted view of Mr. Reid as an Ambassador that is possibly cherished by Mr. Platt . He will have great confidence in his judgment and experience , and will have the satisfaction of gratifying a desire on Mr. Reid 's part that he could not gratify at the time he was obliged to select another to be Ambassador to Great Britain . Mr. Hay will be obliged to leave London shortly , as there will be something less than six weeks to elapse between the naming of the commission on which Secretary Day is to sit and its meeting in Paris on Oct. 1 . It is not expected that he will leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about a fortnight or three weeks , in order to meet Secretary Day here before the latter sails for Paris .
