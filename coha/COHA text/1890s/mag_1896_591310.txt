THE CHILDREN OF THE ROAD . I. THE real " road " is variously named and variously described . By the " ambulanter " it is called Gypsyland , by the tramp Hoboland ; the fallen woman thinks it is the street , the thief that it means stealing and the penitentiary ; even the little boy who reads dime novels and fights hitching-posts for desperadoes believes momentarily that he too is on the real road . All these are indeed branches of the main line . The road proper , or " the turf , " as the people who toil along its stretches sometimes prefer to call it , is low life in general . It winds its way through dark alleys and courts to dives and slums , and wherever criminals , hoboes , outcast women , stray and truant children congregate ; but it never leads to the smiling windows and doorways of a happy home , except for plunder and crime . There is not a town in the land that it does not touch , and there are but few hamlets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its twists and turnings . The travelers , as I have said , are of all kinds , conditions , and ages : some old and crippled , some still in their prime , and others just beginning life . To watch in thought the long and motley procession marching on is to see a panorama of all the sins , sorrows , and accidents known to human experience . Year after year they trudge on and on , and always on , seeking a goal which they never seem to find . Occasionally they hait for a while at some halfway house , where they have heard that there is a restingplace of their desire ; but it invariably proves disappointing , and the tramp , tramp , tramp , begins afresh . Young and old , man and woman , boy and girl , all go on together ; and as one dies or wearies of the march another steps into his heel-tracks , and the ranks close up as solidly as ever . The children of the road have always been to me its most pitiful investiture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looked to the rescue of these prematurely outcast beings . It needs skilled philanthropists and penologists , however , for such a work , and I must content myself with contributing experiences and facts which may perhaps aid in the formation of theory , and thus throw light upon the practical social tasks that are before us . There are four distinct ways by which boys and girls get upon the road : some are born there , some are driven there , others are enticed there , and still others go there voluntarily . Of those who are born on the road , perhaps the least known are the children of the ambulanters . The name is a tramp invention , and not popular among the ambulanters themselves . They prefer to be called gypsies , and try at times , especially when compelled by law to give some account of themselves , to trace their origin to Egypt ; but the most of them , I fear , are degenerated Americans . How they have become so is a question which permits of much conjecture , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken as applicable to the entire class . I know only about fifty families , and not more than half of these at all familiarly ; but those whom I do know seem to me to be the victims of a pure and simple laziness handed down from generation to generation until it has become a chronic family disease . From what they have told me confidentially about their natural history , I pieture their forefathers as harmless village " do-nothings , " who lounged in corner groceries , hung about taverns , and followed the fire-engine and the circus . The // second generation was probably too numerous for the home parish , and , inheriting the talent for loafing , started out to find roomier lounges . It must have wandered far and long , for upon the third generation , the one that I know , the love of roaming descended to such a degree that all North America is none too large for it . Go where one will , in the most dismal woods , the darkest lanes , or on the widest prairies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unkempt family . He comes and goes as his restless spirit dictates , and the horse and wagon carry him from State to State . It is in Illinois that I know his family best . Cavalier John , as he proudly called himself , I remember particularly . He gave me shelter one night in his wagon , as I was toiling along the highway south of Ottawa , and we became such good friends that I traveled with his caravan for three days . And what a caravan it was ! A negro wife , five little mulattoes , a deformed white girl , three starved dogs , a sore-eyed cat , a blasphemous parrot , a squeaking squirrel , a bony horse , and a canvas-topped wagon , and all were headed " Texas way . " John came from Maine originally , but he had picked up his wife in the West , and it was through their united efforts in trickery and clever trading that they had acquired their outfit . So far as I could learn , neither of them had ever done an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to fourteen , and the deformed girl was nearly twenty . John found her among some other ambulanters in Ohio , and , thinking that he might make money out of her physical monstrosities at " side-shows , " cruelly traded off an old fox for her . She ought to have been in an insane asylum , and I hope John has put her there long ago . The other " kidlets , " as they were nicknamed , were as deformed morally as was the adopted girl physically . They had to beg in every town and vil lage they came to , and at night their father took the two oldest with him in his raids on the hen-roosts . It was at town and county fairs , however , that they were the most profitable . Three knew how to pick pockets , and the youngest two gave acrobatic exhibitions . None of them had ever been in school , none could read or write , and the only language they spoke was the one of their class . I have never been able to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tramp dialects with a dash of English slang . On the journey we met another caravan , bound west by way of Chicago . There were two families , and the children numbered sixteen ; the oldest ranging from fifteen to twenty , and the youngest had just appeared . We camped together in a wood for a night and a day , and seldom have I sojourned in such company . John had given me a place with him in the wagon , but now the woman with the babe was given the wagon , and John and I slept , or tried to , " in the open . " In the other wagon , both sexes , young and old , were crowded into a space not much larger than the ordinary omnibus , and the vermin would have made sleep impossible to any other order of beings . The next day , being Sunday , was given over to play and revel , and the poor horses had a respite from their sorrows . The children invented a queer sort of game , something like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as block . They kicked , pounded , scratched , and cursed one another ; but when the play was over all was well again , and the block was tucked away in the wagon for further use . Late at night the journeys were taken up once more , one caravan moving on toward Dakota , and the other toward the Gulf . " Salawakkee ! " * cried John , as he drove away ; and the strangers cried back , " Chalamul " 2 I wonder what has become of that little baby for whom I sat the night out ? So long . 2 Live welL // It is nearly ten years ago now , and he has probably long since been compelled to play his part in crime , and scratch and fight as his older brothers and sisters did on that autumn Sunday morning . Certainly there is nowhere in the world a more ferocious set of children than these of the ambulanters . From morning till night it is one continual snap and bite , and the depraved fathers and mothers look on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their only outlook in life is to some day have a " rig " of their own and prowl throughout the land seeking whom they may devour . To tame them is a task requiring almost divine patience . I should not know how to get at them . They laugh at tenderness , never say " thank you , " and obey their parents only when driven with hoot arid whip . I wish that I could suggest some gentle method by which they could be rescued from the road and made good men and women . It always seems harsh to apply strict law to delinquents so young and practically innocent , but it is the only remedy I can offer . They must be put under stiff rule and order , and trained long and hard . Although lacking gypsy blood they have acquired gypsy character , and it will take generations to get it out of them . Just how many children are born on the road is a question which even the ambulanter would find difficult to answer . They are scattered so widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . In the families that I have met there have never been less than four children . Gypsy Sam once told me that he believed there were at least two hundred ambulanter families in the United States , but this will strike every one as a low estimate ; however , if this is true , and each family has as many boys and girls as those that I have met , then there must be at least a thousand of their kind . Another kind of ragamuffin , also born on the road , and in many ways akin to the ambulanter , although wanting such classification , is the one found so often in those families which every community supports , but relegates to its uttermost boundary lines . They are known as " the McCarthys , " " the Night Hawks , " or " the Holy Frights , " as the case may be . I have found no town in the United States of twenty thousand inhabitants without some such little Whitechapel in its vicinity , and , like the famous original , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a great deal of fiction afloat concerning these tabooed families , a number of them being simply poor or lazy people whom the boys of the vicinity have exaggerated into gangs of desperadoes . There are , however , some that are really very bad , and I have found them even in new little villages . They are not exactly out-andout criminals whom the police can get hold of , but moral lepers who by public consent have been sentenced to live without the pale of civilization . Some years ago I had occasion to visit one of these miniature Whitechapels . It was situated in a piece of woods not far from St. Paul , Minnesota , and belonged by right of appropriation to three families who were called " the Stansons . " A tramp friend of mine had been taken sick in their camp , and I was in duty bound to go out to see him . I managed to find the settlement all right , but was stopped about a hundred yards from the log shanties by a bushybearded man , barefooted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My story evidently satisfied him , for he led the way to the largest of the shanties , where I found my friend . He was lying in the middle of the floor on some straw , the only furniture in the room being a shaky table and a three - legged chair ; all about him , some even lying in the straw beside him , were half-clothed children of both sexes , playing " craps " and eating hunks of bread well daubed with molasses . I counted nine in that shanty // alone , and about as many again in the other two . They belonged severally to six women who were apportioned after Mormon custom to three men . The tramp told me in his dialect that they really were Mormons and came from Utah . He was passing by their " hangout , " as he called it , when taken ill , and they hospitably lodged him . He said they had not been there long , having come up the river from Des Moines , Iowa , where they had also had a camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to St. Paul , to acquire a reputation among the city lads for all kinds of " toughness . " I suppose they were " tough " when considered from certain view-points , but , as the tramp said , it was the silliest kind he had known . They were not thieves , and only lukewarm beggars , but they did seem to love their outlandish existence . The children interested me especially , for they all spoke a queer jargon which they had invented themselves . It was something like the well - known " pig Latin " that all sorts of children like to play with , but much more complicated and difficult to understand . And , except the very youngest , who naturally cried a little , they were the jolliest children I have ever seen in such terrible circumstances . The mothers were the main bread-winners , and while I was there one of them started off to town on a begging trip , with a batch of children as " guy . " The men sat around , smoked , and talked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they occasionally raided a hen-roost . Since my visit to the Stansons I have seen three of the children in different places : one , a cripple , was begging at the World 's Fair ; another was knocking about the Bowery ; and the third , a girl , was traveling with an ambulanter in the Mohawk Valley . Not all of these families are like the Stansons . A number are simply roughand-tumble people who haunt the outskirts of provincial towns , and live partly by pilfering and partly from the municipal fund for the poor . Somehow or other the children always dodge the school commissioners , and grow up , I am sorry to say , very much like their usually unmarried parents . On the other hand , there are several well - known organized hands , and they thrive mainly , I think , in the South and West . Near New Orleans there used to he , and for aught I know they are still there , " the Jim Jams " and " the Rincheros ; " near Cairo , Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dippers ' ; " and not far from New York , in the Rapaho Mountains , I knew of " the Sliders , " but they have since moved on to new fields . Each of these families , or collection of families , had its full quota of children . Very often the public becomes so enraged at their petty thefts that an investigation is ordered , and then there is a sudden packing of traps and quick departure to a different neighborhood , where a new name is invented . But the family itself never dies out entirely . There are a few children who are born in Hoboland . Now and then , as one travels along the railway lines , he will come to a hastily improvised camp where a pale , haggard woman is lying , and beside her a puny infant , scarcely clothed , blinking with eyes of wonder upon the new world about him . I know of no sadder sight than this in all trampdom . Not even the accident of motherhood can make the woman anything but unhuman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world which I believe is unequaled for certain forms of wickedness . Fortunately , his little body usually tires of the life ere he conies to realize what it is , and his soul wanders back to regions of innocence , unsoiled and unscarred . I wonder whether there are still men in iloboland who remember that interesting little fellow called " the Cheyenne Baby " ? Surely there are some who have not forgotten his grotesque // vocabulary , and his utterly overpowering way of using it ? There are different stories concerning his origin , and they vary in truthfulness , I have heard , as one travels southward from the Northern Pacific to Santa   . I give the one told in Colorado . It may be only a " ghost story , " and it may be true ; all that I know is that it is not impossible . According to its teaching , his mother was once respectable and belonged to the politest society in the Indian Territory . When quite a young girl she carelessly fell in love with a handsome Indian chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , married him and went away into his camp . It must have been a wild life that she led there , for within a year she was separated from him and living with another Indian . It is the same pitiful story for the next five years ; she was knocked about from tent to tent , and camp to camp . Her enemies say that she liked that kind of life , but her friends know better , and claim that she was ashamed to go home . However it was , she went over to the cowboys after a while ,  --  and it was then that the baby was horn , and she met the man , whoever he was , that introduced her into Hoboland . She appeared one night at a " hang-out " near Denver , and there was something so peculiarly forlorn about her that the men took pity on her and pressed her to stay . She did , and for some time traveled with the hoboes throughout the districts lying between Cheyenne and Santa   . The boy became a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in Hoboland who was ever taught to be really good . The mother had stipulated with the men that they should never teach him anything bad , and the idea struck them as so comical that they fell in with it . Though they swore continually in his presence , they invariably gave him some respectable version of the conversation ; and while about the only words he knew were curses , he was made to believe they signified the nicest things in the world . He died just as unknowing as he had lived , but it was a cruel death . He and his mother , together with some companions , were caught one night in a wreck on the Union Pacific , and all that the survivors could find of him to bury was his right arm . But that was bravely honored , and , unless the coyotes have torn down the wooden slab , the grave can still be found on the prairies . I can not leave this division of my theme without saying something about that large army of unfathered children who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road as the less known types . True , many of them at birth are handed over to some family to support , but the great majority of these families are not one whit better than the ambulanters . They train the orphans put into their care , in sin and crime , quite as carefully as the hobo does his beggar boy . These are the children who make up the main body of the class I have been considering , and it seems to me that they increase from year to year . At present , the only legitimate career for them is that of the outcast , and into it they go . Few , indeed , succeed in gaining a foothold in polite society . Their little lives form the borderland of my second class , the children driven to the road . III . Concerning the children who are forced upon the road there is a great deal to be said , but I am not sure that much talk should not be directed against the popular belief that their number is legion . Socialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compelled by hunger to beg and steal for a living . In England , I once heard a labor agitator declare that there are a million of these juvenile " victims of capital " in the United States alone . I do not know where the man got his information , but if my finding counts for anything it is deplorably unsound . I can not claim to have studied the // subject as carefully as is necessary to know it absolutely , but in most of our large cities I have given it close attention , and never have I found anything like the state of affairs which even the general public believes to exist . For every child forced by starvation to resort to the road I have met ten who were born there , and nearly the same number who were enticed there . In saying this , however , I do not want to draw emphasis or sympathy away from that certainly existing class of children who really have been driven into outlawry . But it is an injustice to our sober poor to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted . Not long ago I made it my especial business for a while to look into the condition of some of these compulsory little vagabonds in New York city . I picked out those children whom one sees so often pilfering slyly from the groceryman 's sidewalk display . It is an old , old trick . The youngsters divide themselves into " watchers " and " snatchers ; " the former keeping an eye on the police as well as the owners of the things coveted , and the latter grabbing when the wink is given . The crime itself is not a heavy one according to the calendar , but it is only a step from this to picking pockets , and only a half-step farther to highway robbery . I chose this particular class because I had often noticed the members of it in my walks through the city , and it had seemed to me the least necessary of all . Then , too , there was something in the pinched faces that made me anxious to know the children personally on grounds of charity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively well fed , to say the least , and , much as one pities their fate , he will seldom have cause to weep over their starved condition . But here was something different , and I fancied that I was to get a glimpse into the life of those people to whom the socialist points when asked for living examples of human woe caused by inhuman cnpitalists . It was not hard to " get in " with the children . Finding that I was willing to play with them at their games in the alleys and on the tops of their rickety tenement-houses , they nudged up to me , arid we were soon pals . There was nothing particularly new in their life , but I was struck with the great interest they took in their petty thefts . In the midst of the most boisterous play they would gladly stop if some one suggested a clever plan by which even a can of preserves could be " swiped , " as they called it , and the next instant they were trying to carry it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctive criminals , far from it ; but a long intimacy with the practices of outlawry , though small in their way , had so deadened their moral sense that sneak-thieving came to them almost as naturally as it does to the kleptomaniac . Even in their games they cheated whenever it was possible , and it seemed to me that the main fun was seeing how cleverly and yet boldly they could do so without being detected . I recall distinctly one afternoon when we were playing " Hi spy . " A little fellow called Jamie took me aside , and in the most friendly way advised me not to be so " goody-goody . " I had been very unlucky in getting caught , and he said that it was because I gave in too quickly . " When ye hear yer name , " he continued , " jus ' lie low , cause like as not the catcher ai n't seen ye , n ' if he has he ca n't prove it ; so ye r ' all right anyhow . Ye 11 always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; n ' there ai n't no fun in that , is there ? " he added , winking his left eye in a truly professional manner . So much for their native endowment . Their accomplishment in thieving , I have no doubt , kept them often from going hungry , notwithstanding the fact that there was honest industry at home , generally that of the mother , while the fa // ther 's earnings went almost bodily into the publican 's till . I found it much more difficult to make friends with the parents , but succeeded in several cases , - that is , with the mother ; the father I usually found drunk at the saloon . I shall not try to give an account of the squalor and sorrow that I encountered ; this has been done in other places by far more able pens than mine ; but I can not forbear making a note of one little woman whom I saw sewing her very life away , and thinking all the while that she was really supporting her hungry children . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the alley window , driving the needle with lightning-like rapidity through the cloth , - a veritable Madonna of the Needle . Her good cheer was something stupendous . Not once did she murmur , and when her brute of a husband returned , insanely intoxicated , she took care of him as if be were the best man in the world . I was careful that she did not hear from me about the tricks of her wayward children . Some day , however , I fear that one of them will be missing , and when she goes to the police station to make inquiries I should rather not confront her . The main reason why hungry boys and girls are found upon the road is drunken fathers . There are also children who , instead of being forced to steal , are sent out into the streets by their parents to beg . From morning till night they trudge along the busy thoroughfares , dodging with catlike agility the lumbering wagons that bear down upon them , and accosting every person whom their trained eyes find at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , if perchance they have had the necessary luck during the day , they crawl back to their hovels and hand over the winnings to their heavyeyed fathers . Or , as often happens , if the day has been unsuccessful and the pennies are not numerous enough to satisfy their cruel masters , they take refuge in some box or barrel , and pray to the beggar 's Providence that the next day will go better . They come , as a rule , from our foreign population . I have never found one with American-born parents , and in many instances the children themselves have emigrated from Europe , usually from Italy . There is no doubt that they have to beg to live ; but when one looks a little farther into their cases , a lazy or dissipated parent is usually the one to blame . Then , too , mendicancy is not considered disgraceful among many of our immigrants , and they send their children into the streets of our cities quite as freely as they do at home . They also are mainly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns support , where babies are rented to grown-up beggars to excite the sympathy of the passers-by . I looked into one of these places in San Francisco , while traveling with the hoboes , and it was the very counterpart of an African slave-market . A French-Canadian woman , old enough to be the great-grandmother of all her wares , kept it . She rented the babies from poverty-stricken mothers , and re-rented them at a profit to the begging women of the town . There were two customers in the place when I entered , and the old wretch was trying in true peddler style to bring out the good points of four little bits of humanity cuddled together on a plank bed . " Oh , he s just the kind you want , " she said to one of the women ; " never cries , and " - leaning over , she whispered in a Shylock voice - " he do n't eat hardly anything ; half a bottle o ' milk does him the whole day . " The woman was satisfied , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in her arms and went out into the town . The other could find nothing that suited her , but promised to return the next day , when " a new batch " was expected . Such are the main avenues by which // boys and girls are driven to the road in the United States . Hunger , I candidly admit , is the whip in many instances , but the wielder of it is more often than not the drunken father or mother . It is the hunger that comes of selfish indulgence , and not of ill-adjusted labor conditions . III . Of my third class , those who are enticed to the road , - and their number is legion , - I have been able to discover three different types . The old roadster knows them all . Wherever he goes they cross his path , and beg him to stop awhile and tell them of his travels . They seem to realize that they have been swindled , - that the road is , after all , only a tantalizing delusion ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their elders , and it is in the hope that ti ? ese will in the end put them on the right track for the fun they are seeking that they hail them , and cry , " What cheer ? " It is a pitiful call , this , and even the " old stager " winces at times on hearing it , but he can not bring himself to go back on " the profession , " and , quickly conquering his emotion , he gives the tiny traveler fresh directions . The latter starts out anew , hoping against experience that he is at last on the right route , and plods on eagerly until stopped again at some troublesome cross - road where he does not know which turn to take . Once more he asks for directions , once more receives them , and so the ceaseless trudge goes on . It is mainly at the cross-roads that I have learned to know these children . Notwithstanding my alien position , they have hailed me too , and inquired for sign-posts . I have seldom been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I most desired , but surely there are others who can . The children of this third class that one meets oftenest are what the older travelers call " worshipers of the tough . " They have somehow got the idea into their heads that cowboy swagger and the criminal 's lingo are the main features of a manly man , and , having an abnormal desire to be such an one as quickly as possible , they go forth to acquire them . The hunt soon lures them to the road , and up and down its length they scamper , with faces so eager and intent that one is seldom at a loss to know what they are seeking . There are different explanations of the charm that this wild life has for them . A great many people believe that it is purely and simply the work of the devil on their evil-bent natures ; others , that it is the result of bad training ; and still others , that it is one form of the mimicry with which every child is endowed in larger or smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of their hearts they are no worse than the average boy and girl , but they have been unfortunate enough to see a picture or hear a story of some famous rascal , and it has lodged in their brains , until the temptation " to go and do likewise " has come upon them with such overwhelming force that they simply can not resist . Each one has some particular pattern continually before his eyes , and only as he approaches it does he feel that he is becoming " tough . " Now it is " Blinkey " Morgan that fascinates them , and , despite his terrible end , they strive to be like him ; then it is " Wild Bill , " whoever he may be ; and not unfrequently it is a character that has existed only in dime novels , or not even so substantially as that . I remember well a little fellow , about thirteen years old , who appeared in Indian-scout attire one night at a " hang-out " near McCook , Nebraska . He dropped in while the tramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a laugh on the " Q " railway as they gave on seeing him . It was impolite , and they begged his pardon later , but even his guardian angel would have smiled . He was dressed from head to foot in leather clothes , each piece made by himself , he said , and at his belt hung an enormous revolver , which some one had // been careful enough to make useless by taking out an important screw . It was in the hope of finding one at the camp that he visited it , but the men made so much of him that he remained until his story was told . It was not remarkably new , for all that he wanted was a chance to shoot Indians , but his hero was a little unusual , - Kalamazoo Chickamauka , he called him . When asked who he was and where he had lived , all that the youngster could say was that he had dreamed about him ! I saw him again a week or so later , not far from Denver , tramping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his measure , and he hoped to be at " Deadtown , " as he miscalled Deadwood , in a few days . He had not yet found a screw for his " gun , " but he was sure that " Buffalo Charlie " would give him one . Of course this is a unique case , in a way , for one does not meet many lads in such an outfit , but there are scores of others just as sincere and fully as innocent . If one could only get hold of them ere they reach the road , nearly all could be brought to reason . They are the most impressionable children in the world , and there must be a way by which this very quality maybe turned to their advantage . What this way shall be can be determined only by those who know well the needs of each child , but there is one suggestion I can not forbear making . Let everything possible be done to keep these sensitive boys and girls , but particularly the former , from familiarity with crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the picture-covered dime novels and the flaring faces of the Police Gazette . It is just such teaching by suggestion that starts many an honest but romantic boy off to the road , when a little cautious legislation might save him years of foolish wandering , and the state the expense of housing him in its reformatories later on . I write with feeling at this point , for IL know from personal experience what tantalizing thoughts a dime novel will awaken in such a boy 's mind . One of these thoughts will play more havoc with his youth than can be made good in his manhood , and lucky is he whom it does not lure on and on until the return path is forever lost . Something like these children in temperament , but totally different in most other respects , are those lads that one meets so often on our railways , drifting about for a month or so from town to town , seldom stopping in any of them over a day , and then suddenly disappearing , no one knows where , to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand miles distant . Occasionally they are missed from the road for over a year , and there is absolutely no news of their whereabouts ; but just as they are almost forgotten they come forward once more , make a few journeys on the freight trains , and vanish again . There are cases on record where they have kept this up for years , some of them coming and going with such regularity that their appearances may be calculated exactly . Out West , not very long ago , there was a little chap who " showed up " in this way , to use the expression that the brakemen applied to him , every six weeks for three years , but this was all that was known concerning him . When asked who he was and where he belonged , he gave such evasive answers that it was impossible to come to any trustworthy conclusion about him . He would have nothing to do with the people he met , and I have heard that he always rode alone in the box cars . In this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , these little nomads take great pleasure in talking with strangers , but they are careful not to say too much about themselves . They ask questions principally , and skip from one subject to another with a butterfly rapidity , but manage to pick up a great deal of knowledge of the road . The tramp 's theory of them is that // they are possessed of " the railroad fever , " and I ani inclined to agree with them , hut I accept the expression in its broader sense of Wanderlust . They want to get out into the world , and at stated periods the desire is so strong and the road so handy that they simply can not resist the temptation to explore it . A few weeks usually suffice to cool their ardor , and then they run home quite as summarily as they left , but they stay only until the next runaway mood seizes them . I have been successful in getting really well acquainted with several of these interesting wanderers , and in each case this has been the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and many of them could not be if they tried ; but they have a passion for seeing things on their own hook , and if the mood for " a trip " comes it seems to them the most natural thing in the world to indulge it . If they had the means they would ride on Pullman cars and imagine themselves princes , but lacking the wherewithal they take to the road . I knew in New York State a boy of this sort who had as nice a home as a child could wish , but he was cursed with this strange Wanderlust , and throughout his boyhood there was hardly a month that he did not run away . The queerest things enticed him to go . Sometimes the whistle of a railway engine was enough to make him wild with unrest , and again the sight of the tame but to him fascinating village street was sufficient to set him planning his route of travel . In every escapade it was his imagination that stampeded him . Many a time , when he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world at large , and what it held in waiting for him , would dance across his brain , and before he could analyze it , or detect the swindle , lie was scampering off for " the depot . " Now it was a wish to go West arid play trapper and scout and then it was the dream of American boyhood , - a life cramped but struggling , and emerging in glorious success as candidate for the presidency . Garfield 's biography , I remember , once started him on such a journey , and it took years to get the notion out of his head that simply living and striving as Garfield did was not sure to bring the same results . Frequently his wanderings ended several hundred miles from home , but much oftener in some distracting vagabond 's " hang-out " in a neighboring city . Fortunately the fever burned itself out ere he had learned to like the road for its own sake , and he lived to wonder how he had harbored or indulged such insane impulses . A large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgent parents to return to , and after a while the repeated punishment seems to them so unjust and cruel that there comes " a trip " which never ends . The Wanderlust becomes chronic , and mainly because it was not treated properly in its intermittent stage . There is no use in whipping these children ; they are not to blame ; all that one can do is to busy their imaginations in wholesome ways , watch them carefully , and , if they must wander , direct their wanderings . In many cases this is possible , for the fever breaks out aniong children of the best birth as well as among those of the lowest ; and in these instances , at least , the parents have much to answer for if the children reach the road . I look upon this fever as quite as much of a disease as the craze to steal which is found now and then in some child 's character , and it deserves the same careful treatment . Punishment only aggravates it , and develops in the boy a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some day this trouble in so many boys ' lives will be pathologically treated by medical men , and the sooner that day comes the better will it be for many unfortunate children . It is a different story that I have to tell of the children decoyed into Hoboland . True , they also are , in a measure , seized with this same Wanderlust , and // without this it would be impossible for the tramp to influence them as lie does ; but , on the other hand , without him to excite and direct this passion , very few of them would ever reach trampdom . He happens along at their very weakest moments , and , perceiving his advantage , cruelly fires their imagination with tales of adventure and travel , and before they discover their danger he has them in his clutches . It is really one of the wonders of the world , the power that this ugly , dissipated , tattered man has over the children lie meets . In no other country that I have visited is there anything like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collects the likely boys about him at his " hang-out , " picks out the one that he thinks will serve him best , and then begins systematically to fascinate him . If he understands the art well ( and it is a carefully studied art ) , he can almost always get the one he wants . Often enough his choice is some well-bred child , unaccustomed , outside his dreams , to any such life , but the man knows so perfectly how to piece out those dreams and make them seducingly real that in a moment of enthusiasm the youngster gives himself up to their bewitching influence and allows the wretch to lead him away . As a rule , however , his victims are the children of the poor , for they are the easiest to approach . A few hours of careful tactics , provided they are in the mood , and he has one of them riding away with him , not merely in the box car of a freight , but on the through train to Hoboland . Watch him at his preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash-barrel in a filthy back alley . A crowd of gainins gaze up at him with admiring eyes . When he tells his ghost stori Cs , each one thinks that he is being talked to just as much as the rest , and yet somehow , little by little , there is a favorite who is getting more and more than his share of the winks and smiles ; soon the most exciting parts of the stories are gradually devoted to him alone , but in such an artful way that he himself fails to notice it at first . It is not long , however , before he feels his importance . He begins to wink , too , but just as slyly as his charmer , and his little mouth curls into a return smile when the others are not looking . " I m his favorite , I am , " he thinks . " He 11 take me with him , he will , and show me things . " He is what the hobo calls " peetrified , " which means , as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard amount to very little in themselves , but the way they are told , the happy-golucky manner , the subtle partiality , the winning voice , and the sensitiveness of the boy 's nature to things of wonder , all combine to turn his head . Then his own parents can not control him as can this slouching wizard . In Hobohand the boy 's life may be likened to that of a voluntary slave . He is forced to do exactly what his " jocker " commands , and disobedience , willful or innocent , brings down upon him a most cruel wrath . Besides being kicked , slapped , and generally maltreated , he is also loaned , traded , and even sold , if his muster sees money in the bargain . There are , of course , exceptions , for I have myself known some jockers to be almost as kind as fathers to their boys , but they are such rarities that one can never count upon them . When a lad enters trampdom lie must be prepared for all kinds of brutal treatment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be for him . In payment for all this suffering and rough handling , he is told throughout his apprenticesbip that some day he too will be able to " snare " a boy , and make hh*m beg and slave for him as he has slaved for others . This is the one reward that tramps hold out to their " prushuns , " and the little fellows cherish it so long that , when their emancipation finally comes , nearly all start off to do the very same thing that was done to them when they were children . // West of the Mississippi River there is a regular gang of these " ex-kids , " as they are termed in the vernacular , and all are supposed to be looking for revenge . Until they get it there is still something of the prushun about them which makes them unwelcome in the " old staber " class . So they prowl about the community from place to place , looking eagerly for some weak lad whom they can decoy and show to the fraternity as evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful thing they are doing . If you remonstrate with them , they reply , " W'y , ye do n't think we ye been slavin ' all this while fer nothin ' , do ye ? It s our turn to play jocker now , " and , with a fiendish look in their eyes , they turn and stalk away . Ten years and more of tramp life have killed their better natures , and all that they can think of is vengeance , unscrupulous and sure . In this way the number of boys in Hoboland is always kept up to a certain standard . Every year a number are graduated from the prushun class , and go out into the world immediately to find younger children to take the places they have left . In time these do the same thing , and so on , until to-day there is no line of outlawry so sure of recruits as vagabondage . Each beggar is a propagandist , and his brethren expect of him at least one convert . Iv . There is not much that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntarily . I am sure that there are such , for I have traveled with them , but it has been impossible for me to get into their life intimately enough to speak of it intelligently . Even the men constantly in their company can say but little about them . When asked for an explanation , they shake their heads and call them " little devils ; " but why they are so , what it is that they are seeking , and where they come from are questions to which they are unable to give any satisfactory replies . I know about twenty , all told , and , as far as I have been successful in observing them , they seem to me to belong to that class of children which the criminologist Loinbroso finds morally delinquent at birth . Certainly it would be hard to account for their abnormal criminal sense on any other ground . They take to the road as to their normal element , and are on it but a short time ere they know almost as much as the oldest travelers . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive powers almost uncanny . To hear them talk makes one think , if he shuts his eyes , that he is in the presence of trained criminal artists , and I have sometimes imagined that they were not children , but dwarfed men born out of due time . They undertake successfully some of the most dangerous robberies in the world , and come off scot-free , so that old and experienced thieves simply stare and wonder . The temptation is to think that they are accidents , but they recur so frequently as to demand a theory of origin and existence . They are , I do not doubt , the product of criminal breeding , and are just as much admired in the criminal world as are the feats of some Wunderkind , for instance , among musicians . Watch the scene in an outcast 's den when one of these queer little creatures comes in , and you may see the very same thing that goes on in the " artist 's box " at some concert where a prodigy is performing . The people swarm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till the proprietor finds him a valuable drawing card for the establishment . The child himself seldom realizes his importance , and , when off duty , plays at gaines in keeping with his age . The instant business is suggested , however , his countenance assumes a most serious air , and it is then that one wonders whether he is not , after nll , some skillful old soul traveling back through life in a fresh young body . Indeed , there is so much in his case that appeals to my // 70 sense of wonder that I simply can not study him for what he is ; but there are those who can do this , and I promise them a most interesting field of observation . I know enough about it to believe that if it can be thoroughly explored there will be a great change in the punishment of criminals . These boys have in them in largest measure what the entire body of moral delinquents possesses in some degree ; and when these baffling characteristics have been definitely analyzed an ( l placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be worth while to say what I can about their physical appearance . The most of them have seemed to me to have fairly well-formed bodies , but something out of the ordinary in their eyes , and in a few cases in the entire face . Sometimes the left eye has drooped very noticeably , and one boy that I recall had something akin to a description I once heard of " the evil eye . " It was a gypsy who explained it to me ; and if he was right , that " a little curtain , " capable of falling over the eyeball at will , is the main curiosity , then this boy had the evil eye . He could throw a film over his eye in the most distressing fashion , and delighted in the power to do so ; indeed , it was his main way of teasing people . He knew that it was not a pleasant sight , and if he had a petty grudge to gratify he chose this very effective torment . Concerning the faces , it is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly deformed , but there was a peculiar depravity about them that one could but notice instantly . At times I fancied that it was in the arrangement of features rather than acquired expression of the life ; but there were cases where the effects of evil environment and cruel abuse were plain to see . I have sometimes taken the pains to look up the parents of a child who thus interested me , but I could not discover any similarity of depravity in their countenances . There was depravity January , there , to be sure , but of a different kind . I believe that the parents of these children , and especially the mothers , could tell a great deal concerning them , and the theorists in criminology will never be thoroughly equipped for their work till all this evidence has been heard . The foregoing is but a partial summary of several years ' experience with the children of the road . It is far from being what I should like to write about them , but perhaps enough has been said to forestate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these children and learned to know them " in the open. ** Surely there is kindness and ingenuity enough in the world to devise a plan or a system by which they may be snatched from the road and restored to their better selves . Surely , too , these little epitomes of Wanderlust , and even of crime , are not to baffle philanthropy and science forever . I feel sure that whatever may be the answer to the thousand questions which centre in this problem , one thing can be done , and done at once . Wherever law is able to deal with these children , let it be done on the basis of an intelligent classification . In punishing them for their misdemeanors and crimes , let them not be tumbled indiscriminately into massive reform institutions , officered by political appointment and managed with an eye to the immediate interests of the taxpayer instead of the welfare of the inmates . The one practical resource that lies nearest to our hand as philanthropic sociologists is the reform of the reformatories . We may not hope to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we are deserving of a far worse punishment than these moral delinquents if , as well born and well bred , we do not set ourselves resolutely to the bettering of penal conditions once imposed . First of all , we must have a humane and scientific separation of the inmates in all these reformatories . Sex , age , // height , and weight are not the only things to be taken into consideration when dealing with erring children . Birth , temperament , habits , education , and experience are questions of far more vital importance , and it is no unreasonable demand upon the state that careful attention to each of these points be required in the scheme of such institutions . Put an ambulanter 's child with a simple runaway boy , and there will be two ambulanters ; associate a youngster with the passion to be " tough " with a companion innately criminal , and the latter will be the leader . The law of the survival of the fittest is just as operative in low life as in any other . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially good must yield to them unless zealously defended by outside help . It is suicidal to put them together , and wherever this is done , especially among children , there need be no surprise if criminals , and not citizens , are developed . Second , the management of reformatories should be in scientific hands ; and just here I am constrained to plead for the training of young men and women for the rare usefulness that awaits them in such institutions . It is to these places that the children I have been describing will have to go , and , with all respect to the officials now in charge , I believe that there are apt and gifted young men and women in this country who could bring to them invaluable assistance , if they could only be persuaded to train for it and to offer it . I do not know why it is , but for some reason these institutions do not yet appeal to any large number of students who intend taking service in the ranks of Reform . rrhe University Settlement attracts many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that universal brotherhood which I believe is drawing on . Meanwhile , there is a moral hospital service to be carried on in penal and reformatory houses . Shall it be done by raw , untrained hands , or by selfish quacks , or by careful , scientific students ? Must the moral nurse and physician be chosen for his ability to control votes , or to treat his patients with skilled attention and consideration ? If the treatment of physical disease offers attractions that call thousands upon thousands of young men and women into the nursing and medical professions , here may be offered a field even more fascinating to the student , and so full of opportunity and interesting employment that it will be a matter of wonder if the supply does not speedily exceed the demand . There is one thing more . Reformatories , planned , officered , and conducted according to the principles of scientific philanthropy , should be stationed , not at the end of the road , bat at the junction of every by-path that leads into it .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
