txt HE death of General Sherman removes the last of the conspicuously successful generals of the Union forces . It is true that there are still living in the North generals who have commanded large armies with distinction , who have fought and won great battles . But neither Bud nor Rosecrans , neither Pope nor Banks , remained in active command till the close of the war . The day of final triumph found others in their places . Hence it may not be inappropriate at this time , when , arrested by the death of the brilliant officer who has so recently left us , the minds of those who have lived through the war naturally turn to the scenes they have witnessed and the experience they have passed through , to glance at some of the more salient features and characteristics of our late struggle . The magnitude of the task which the North proposed to itself  --  the conquest of such a vast territory , defended by such an able , resolute , and gallant population-was not fully seen at the beginning . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring of 1861 . The splendid opportunity , which then existed and never came again , of increasing the regular army to a force exceeding a hundred thousand men , was carelessly thrown away . Sherman , who insisted that at least two hundred thousand men would be required for the single task of opening the Mississippi River , was regarded , even as late as the fall of 1861 , by the then Secretary of War , as almost insane . Similar misconceptions prevailed among our Southern neighbors . Their authorities made no use of the opportunity which existed at the outset of the war of carrying cotton to England and drawing bills against it for the financial needs of the Confederacy . The orders which they sent to Europe for the purchase of arms and ammunition were wholly inadequate to their needs . Their preparations for defending their borders against the threatened invasion of the North were exceedingly imperfect . Nor was this to be wondered at . The people of the United States then were and are still an unmiitary peoplelike their cousins on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , by no means averse to fighting ; they are unquestionably as obstinate and resolute fighters as any people on earth . But that is quite a different thing from being a military people . The " art military " was cultivated by but few of the officers of the regular army ; to the major part of them and to the public at large it was nearly unknown . Hence , the recommendations of sagacious military men , like Sherman , on our side , and J. E. Johnston , on the other , were made to unreceptive ears , and were received with that peculiar impatience // with which people of average abilities and fair success in life hear unwelcome advice on a subject of which they know nothing , but which in their hearts they believe to be a very simple matter . The North was the first to rise to the height of the situation . Not only did the mortifying issue of the first battle of Bull Run put an end to the easy-going confidence with which up to that time her prosperous communities had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of rousing that strong and determined purpose to achieve success , which had always characterized the energetic , indefatigable , resolute workers of the Eastern and Western States from Maine to Minnesota . The Northern people , accustomed to the control of ample resources and to the carrying on of large business undertakings , made their preparations in the winter of 1861 and 1862 on a large scale . There was no stint anywhere . Men , money , ships , guns , horses , equipment of every kind , were freely forthcoming . The spring of 1862 saw large armies , admirably appointed , welldrilled , and well-officered , standing on the borders of the Confederacy , waiting only the order to march ; a wellequipped navy , not only held all the Southern coast in the grip of its blockade , but dominated the great rivers which commanded the communications of all the advanced posts of the enemy in the West . And these vast hosts were full of a genuine and strong devotion to the cause of their country . On the other side of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South . A careless confidence , degenerating often into contempt for their adversaries , combined with the unfamiliarity of the Southern planter with the conduct of great business enterprises , was evidenced in the weak army which J. E. Johnston opposed to that of McClellan in the East , in the wholly inadequate preparations of A. S. Johnston to maintain the hold of the Confederacy in the States of Kentucky and Tennessee , in the insufficient defences of New Orleans . When the storm had passed away , New Orleans had fallen ; Kentucky and Tennessee were under Federal control ; the Missis sippi was free as far as Vicksburg ; and it was Richmond and not Washington that was in imminent peril . But the series of disasters with which the year 1862 opened did not daunt the spirit of the South ; on the contrary , the soldiers and people of the Confederacy , now realizing for the first time the desperate nature of the contest , strengthened themselves in their determination never to yield , and redoubled their efforts . The levies of the North were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In place of the comforts and luxuries which were ruthlessly taken away by the invasion and the blockade , was now to be seen the patient and enduring temper which can dispense with all that is not of absolute necessity . The Southern generals met the superior numbers of their foes with an audacity and enterprise which they had not hitherto shown that they possessed . Six weeks after Fort Donelson had surrendered with fifteen thousand men , and Kentucky and the greater part of Tennessee had been abandoned to the Union arms , the scattered and demoralized forces of the Confederacy in the West were united under the lead of Albert Sidney Johnston . That able and daring officer at once took the initiative . Grant at Shiloh was surprised by one of the most sudden , fierce , and determined onslaughts known to military history ; and although he , with the aid of a portion of Buell 's army , held his own , and finally succeeded in forcing his opponent to retire , the whole affair showed how far the Soath was from being willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his marvellous sagacity and daring enterprise , entirely disconcerted the plans of the Washington Government for massing an overwhelming force against Richmond ; and , on Jackson 's finally uniting his force to that of Lee , McClellan , whose peculiar characteristics were ill suited to deal with such emergencies , was forced to undertake a dangerous and difficult retreat from the immediate neighborhood of Richmond to Harrison 's Landing on the river James . The Federal Government , with a praiseworthy desire to stop unnecessary expense and a happy credulity as to // the certainty of the success which they were sure must result from their really enormous military preparations for the spring campaign , had , early in April , 1862 , actually stopped recruiting , and the Army of the Potomac now urgently needed reinforcements . But the people of the North were in their comprehension of the situation far ahead of their rulers . The governors of the Northern States met together , and begged President Lincoln to call for three hundred thousand men . Mr. Lincoln was really astounded at the size of the requisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . He thought at first that half the number would do . But the governors , Andrew , Morgan , Curtin , Morton , and the others , able men of affairs and of large experience , and who were moreover the representatives and spokesmen of the business men of the North and West , knew better , and three hundred thousand it was . These illustrations show how the emergencies of the war served to bring out the resolute and unyielding traits belonging to our race  --  the unconquerable determination to meet and conquer every difficulty , either by some new contribution of force , or by some desperate and daring expedient , or by patience and perseverance under existing circumstances . The war thus becomes psychologically interesting as an exhibition of the Anglo-Saxon race on trial , and on a grand theatre . What we have just said about the governors of the Northern States and President Lincoln leads naturally to the characteristics of the latter 's administration during the war . It certainly can not be said to have been a brilliant administration . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessarily spent , a great many men needlessly sacrificed , and a great deal of time uselessly consumed . The resources of the North were vast , and they were tendered to the Government with a patriotism and liberality that knew no measure . But the task was one that would have taxed the abilities of the most experienced ruler , and Mr. Lincoln was anything but an experienced ruler . Wisely , economically , and judiciously to collect and dispose of the enormous resources of the United States required a familiarity with the conduct of affairs on a large scale , utterly beyond anything with which the President had ever had anything to do in the whole course of his life . Abraham Lincoln , though new to public office , was probably the wisest and most sagacious statesman we have ever had in this country ; his political management of affairs during the war illustrated his great qualities and won the admiration of all men . But the military tasks imposed by the war were not only entirely outside of Mr. Lincoln 's previous experience , but even he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first realize that in such matters he had better consult experts , and be guided by them . His first appointments in the army were made almost at random . Major-generals , brigadier-generals , colonels , lieutenant-colonels , without technical training and of no military experience , appeared like comets at the head of armies and departments , or invaded the hitherto sacred quarters of the officers of the regular army , and many were the blunders with which the fates avenged these uncalled-for and injudicious vagaries of the new President . In this connection it is interesting to note the difference between the mistakes into which President Lincoln fell in his management of military affairs , and those made by his rival on the other side of the line . The fllinois lawyer was , as we have just said , absolutely without any knowledge of military matters , and , what was quite as important , he was entirely unacquainted with the personnel of the army . Mr. Davis , on the other hand , had been educated at West Point , and had moreover been Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well known as are the members of the bar to a lawyer in large practice . The characters , special acquirements , abilities , defects , of the leading lawyers of a great city are always more or less accurately known to their brethren , while a layman coming from another city must pick up his information about them as best he can . So it was with the two Presidents . Mr. Lincoln 's want of acquaintance with the army displayed itself in sundry astonishing appointments to high commands . Mr. Davis , on the // other hand , not oniy knew his men perfectly well , but he had the great advantage of making out his own rank listan advantage which was really unique . On the other hand , there were disadvantages , and those real ones , which were inseparable from the relation in which the President of the Southern Confederacy stood to the high officers in its service . There was first , the almost inevitable tendency of a man in his position , who has been educated for the army , to meddle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Davis not infrequently yielded , and from which several of the most distinguished generals of the South suffered from time to time ; and , secondly , there was the personal relation between Mr. Davis and the leading officers , men of somewhere near his own age , and in regard to whom he , naturally enough , entertained the usual personal feelings that everyone has for those whom one has always known . Hence , while it cost Mr. Lincoln nothing to relieve any officer whom he thought to be unfit for his work , or to sustain one who was , as he thought , doing it well-they being all , or nearly all , personally unknown to him-it was an open secret that Mr. Davis 's preferences and dislikes interfered , in the opinion of many good judges , with his management of the military affairs of the Confederacy . It is plain from what has just been said , that the errors of the Northern President were of a kind that experience could be expected to cure-that is , if he were at bottom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while those peculiar to Mr. Davis 's administration were not likely to become ameliorated by lapse of time . And this turned out to be the fact . Mr. Lincoln 's ability to select men for high military command increased visibly from year to year during the war ; and not only was this the case , but his ability to give them an intelligent and appreciative support and encouragement , if they deserved it at his hands , became with every year more and more apparent . The President became , in fact , a diligent student of the war . He found in time that the rules of war were only the rules of sound sense and experience applied to a subject the general principles of which , although he knew nothing of them at the beginning of his administration , he found himself able without great difficulty to acquire and act upon . Hence his conduct of affairs became with each year more judicious and capable . No generals could ask from any government for more considerate and intelligent support than that usually accorded by Mr. Lincoln to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Davis 's peculiarities grew every year more and more pronounced . It is not necessary to give illustrations at length ; it will suffice to compare the steady and unwavering backing which General Sherman received in his Atlanta campaign with the treatment of General Johnston by the Confederate Government . At the same time , it would be foolish and useless to deny that in one respect , and that a very important one , Mr. Lincoln 's administration of military affairs cannot be said to have improved with the progress of the war . We refer , of course , to the influence which the supposed necessities of politics had upon appointments to high command and assignments to duty in the field . Not even the most devoted admirers of President Lincoln would undertake to maintain that he always acted up to his lights as the commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States in all the commissions which he conferred , or in all the tasks which he laid out to be performed by the soldiers and sailors . For instance , it will hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii the spring of 1864 reached a point of development quite adequate to the task of refusing to General Butler the command of the two corps destined to make the co-operative movement on Richmond . To suppose that Mr. Lincoln did not know better than this , is to do gross injustice to his mental faculties . Everybody in the United States who knew anything about military matters , who had followed with the slightest attention the course of war , was amazed at the selection of Butler , not because he was nOt an able man , or a patriotic man , but because he had given no evidence of capacity for such a re // sponsible task , and because there were plenty of men to be had who had shown talent of a high order . Mr. Lincoln must have known , we repeat , that to intrust this important duty to Butler was not a thing which could be defended on purely military grounds ; more than this , he knew as well as anybody that it was not common sense to do it . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officer who had just been called by Congress to take the general charge and management of all the military operations . For Grant desired that this important command should be given to General William F. Smith , whose brilliant operations near Chattanooga had deservedly won the highest encomiums . Whether any supposed political necessity could justify the course which Mr. Lincoln saw fit to pursue on this and similar occasions , is , to make the best of it , exceedingly doubtful Certainly no political crisis at that time was impending which could serve as such a justification . Common sense and the plainest principles of duty alike demand that the conduct of military movements shall be intrusted to the most skilful and competent officers who can be found . And although the American people , with their wonted tolerance and charity , have long since forgotten and forgiven these acts of a president whose devotion to the cause of his country was so conspicuous and sincere , yet some consideration of them can not be omitted in making an estimate of Mr. Lincoln 's administration of our military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapse of so many years , its characteristic features stand out far more clearly than they did at the time . We must acknowledge that the lack of a sound military direction at Washington for the first three years protracted the struggle by expending our efforts to a very considerable extent in useless or ill-considered plans . Things certainly went better when Grant was called to take the entire control ; but even under him there were costly and unnecessary expeditions , and not a little scattering of forces which might have been concentrated to give additional strength to the blows which he was preparing to strike . On the other side , also , we see the same faults . If the trans-Mississippi troops had been placed under Johnston* s orders , who can tell how long that able soldier might not have held Vicksburg ? Had Beauregard 's and Johnston 's advice been heeded in the last few months even , it is possible that a really formidable army might have been collected to confront Sherman in the Carolinas . But the very natural tendency of the invader to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of his antagonist to be prepared for defence at all points , operated to multiply occasions of conflict and rendered the main operations of the war less formidable and striking than they might have been made . In the conduct of their campaigns the generals in our war , on both sides , showed themselves better strategists than tacticians . The safety of the armies was very rarely compromised by lack of due precautions to keep up the communications . The maneuvring was sometimes very skilfuL The operations of the Atlanta campaign contain admirable illustrations of good strategy on the part of both commanders , * and there are other instances in plenty , of which the operations of Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley in the spring of 1862 are , perhaps , the most conspicuous . But , mainly owing , we suspect , to the absolute lack of experience before the war in seeing large bodies of men and observing their movements , it certainly seemed to be well-nigh impossible for the American general when he took the offensive , to get his battle fought as he intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's battle at Seven Pines ; * General Lee 's battles at Malvern Hill and at Gettysburg ; General McClellan 's battle at Antietam . These are instances of battles undertaken with preparation- though this is not so true of Malvern Hill as of the others-and with a plan in each case deliberately adopted , to carry out which the commanding general used his best endeavors . Yet the result was notoriously far * while this is being written the news arrives that General Joseph K Johnston , Sherman 's great antagonist in that campaign , has passed away . Of the confederate officers , he was second only to Lee . t As the confederates term the action of May 111 , 1862. // from satisfying his just expectations . General Thomas 's battle of Nashville constitutes a brilliant exception to these remarks . The easier tactical task of repelling an attack was often most ably performed , as , for instance , by Lee at Antietam and Fredericksburg , and by Meade at Gettysburg . Then there were generals , the most conspicuous of whom were Grant and Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed to directing the details of the conflicts which their manoeuvres had rendered certain to occur . The battles near Atlanta in July , 1864 , and the series of bloody actions in May and June , of the same year , in Virginia , illustrate this . The mode in which cavalry was employed in our war varied a good deal with different commanders , and in different stages of the war . From the time when the Black Horse Cavalry struck terror into the demoralized three months ' volunteers at the first battle of Bull Run to the day when Sheridan 's powerful cavalry corps held Lee 's line of retreat from Appomattox Court House , both sides doubtless learned much regarding the employment and functions of mounted men . But American generals did not , it must be confessed , take readily to the task of handling properly this arm of the service . Very likely the fact that cavalry could no longer be expected to perform on the field of battle the duties which had hitherto constituted their chief and most glorious function , rendered our officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their horse . At first , picket duty seemed most attractive-not to the cavalry , of course , but to the general commanding the armyand horses and men were freely and ruthlessly sacrificed in this way . Then there was the important but humble task of guarding trains . But what fascinated alike the imagination of the trooper and the ingenious mind of the American general , was a raid , designed to burn bridges and tear up railroad tracks , to destroy supplies , capture trains , and the like . An operation of this kind necessarily involved great risks , but , bordering , as it did , in its characteristic features , on partisan warfare , it possessed great attractions for the cavalry themselves . What good was accomplished in this way has never been figured up . Stuart 's raid around McClellan 's lines in June , 1862 , may have served a useful purpose in creating a feeling of insecurity in the Army of the Potomac ; but the only tangible result of the repetition of the performance in August of the same year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while , when for the third time the manoeuvre was tried , in the Gettysburg campaign the next summer , the march of the Federal army northward actually prevented the Confederate cavalry from rejoining their main army and reporting the movements of the Federals . It was much the same thing in our experience . Hooker , the first general to set a proper value on his cavalry , no sooner got a large and finely mounted and equipped body of cavalry together , than he sent them off , a fortnight before he commenced his own campaign , to destroy the enemy 's communications and supplies , and to render their retreat , in the event of a Federal success in the impending struggle between the two armies , more disastrous than it otherwise could be . The result of this farseeing move was to deprive the Army of the Potomac of the information which would have prevented the great disaster of the campaign of Chancellorsville . In the march on Gettysburg , in the summer of 1863 , General Meade employed his cavalry with excellent judgment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallant and successful fighL on our right flank on July 3d , fully justified his policy of keeping his cavalry well in hand , and under his own eye . But this policy was entirely reversed by General Grant . The campaign of 1864 had hardly opened when Sheridan was allowed to go off , on his own suggestion and evidently against Meade 's judgment , with nearly all the cavalry of the army , on a raid toward Richmond , and it was not until Grant had crossed the Pam unkey that the cavalry rejoined the main body . Then , for a very few days , they remained with the army , and rendered excellent service , among other things // capturing and holding Cold Harbor . But when , a fortnight later , the army had got down before Petersburg , Sheridan was on another raid , and the opportunity which really existed during the 16th and 17th of June of taking Petersburg when its defenders numbered less than fifteen thousand men was unknown at headquarters , simply for lack of cavalry to make the needed reconnoissances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Sheridan won in the Appomattox campaign have demonstrated beyond doubt or cavil that the best service to which cavalry can be put in modern warfare , is to be rendered in conjunction with the operations of the main army . But that this service was rendered in this campaign by Sheridan 's cavalry was certainly not due to General Grant . He had planned for Sheridan , and had ordered him to execute , a movement on the upper James , with a view of destroying the enemy 's supplies and communications , and , after having accomplished these tasks , he was to join Sherman in the Carolinas , or else , if that were found impracticable , he was to fall back to Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley . Fortunately for the country , Sheridan found it impossible to carry out his orders , and he therefore made his way to General Grant at City Point . Even here , both Sheridan and Rawlins , Grant 's chief of staff , a thoroughly practical and able man , were by no means sure at first that Grant intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was destined for the campaign which was then just about to open ; and it is quite certain that Grant inclined even at this period to the opinion that Sheridan would do well to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac and join Sherman in North Carolina . Other instances of this strange inability or unwillingness of the American general to make use of cavalry in connection with the operations of the main army readily occur . Sherman , as is well known , in his Atlanta campaign , did not rel*y to any great extent on his horse , although the opportunities for employing cavalry to advantage must have been of constant occurrence from the time he left Dalton . And in his march across the country to Savannah he took with him only two brigades , in all about five thousand men . At the close of the war , however , this arm of the service had gained due recognition . Not only was the country ringing with the achievements which Sheridan , at the head of his ten thousand horse , had obtained in the Appomattox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Wilson , at the head of a similar force , fresh and admirably mounted and equipped , was overrunning the now almost deserted States of Alabama and Georgia , destroying and defeating everything that came in his way . In this case there was , it is true , no army for the cavalry commander to co-operate with . But this movement of Wilson 's was no ordinary raid , for he was practically sure of meeting no opposition which his force was not quite adequate to overcome ; it was rather the march of an invading column . The views above given as to the employment of cavalry on raids differ , we presume , from those entertained during the war by most of the leading generals on both sides . Yet there is nothing , we submit with confidence , in which the effect of the lapse of time is more discernible than in changing our views of cavalry raids . It is almost inconceivable to us now , that General Lee should have sent Stuart , with less than two thousand cavalry , in October , 1862 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the towns and counties of central Pennsylvania , picking up horses , clothing , boots and shoes , a few prisoners , and what not , and running the most imminent risk of being captured with his whole command . What possible good could Stuart do to the Confederacy with his petty booty , which could be compared for a moment with the exultation with which the news of his capture would have been received at the North , and the injury which it would have been to General Lee 's army to have lost its great cavalry leader ? So in the Gettysburg campaign-when Lee actually gave Stuart carte blanche to do as he likedwhether to keep between the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac , or to attempt to make the cir // cuit of the latter army . What Lee and Stuart had in their minds as conceivably-by any effort of the imagination - of more importance than the ascertainment by the Confederate cavalry from day to day of the movements of the Federal army and the conveyance of this information promptly to General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that stage in the war , it was out of the question that the Federal Army should be " rattled " by any such game as this . Both officers and men were altogether too well seasoned to war to care very much where Stuart 's four or five thousand men might be . The trains were well guarded ; all Stuart succeeded in bagging were a hundred and twenty-five wagons and four or five hundred prisoners ; but , as this was all he had to show in justification of his course , he brought them all in , notwithstanding the continual delays caused by such impedimenta . General Halleck was probably the only Federal officer at all worried by this eccentric movement of Stuart 's , and he kept telegraphing Meade , who was in command of the Army of the Potomac , to take measures to capture Stuart 's column , which might , so Halleck thought , do unknown damage somewhere . But Meade , intent on the great task before him , was not to be diverted by any side-show like this . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halleck , " being to find out and fight the enemy , I shall have to submit to the cavalry raids around me in some measure . " The truth is , that , considering the great difficulties which , during the period of our war , attended the raising of a well-drilled , well-equipped , and wellmounted body of horse , it was not good policy for any commander , and especially for any Confederate commander , to take needless risks with his cavalry , or to subject it to unnecessary hardship and loss . While it is perfectly true that occasions where a body of horse could be utilized in actual combat were infrequent , it must be remembered that cavalry had other and often much more important functions to perform than taking part in a pitched battle , and that for the due performance of these duties the utmost efficiency of both horses and men was required . Take as an illustration the work of Sheridan 's command in the last campaign . Here was a corps of cavalry , admirably commanded and sufficiently large to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the march of the infantry , ascertaining the right roads , seizing the important points in advance of the arrival of the main columns and holding them until support arrived , it rendered the task of the infantry and artillery , which constituted the main army , immeasurably easier and much surer of successful accomplishment . Finally , in actually getting ahead of the flying foe and barring his retreat , Sheridan 's horse showed to perfection what cavalry can do in modern war . But in order that cavalry can render such service as this , their strength and efficiency must be carefully preserved until the decisive moment arrives . And the decisive moment is the moment when the great collision between the two armies takes place . For in spite of all the railroad ties that were torn up , and of all the barns that were burned , General Lee did not leave Petersburg and Richmond until the r*sult of the battle of Five Forks rendered it impossible for him to remain in his lines ; and the battle of Five Forks was won by infantry and cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of American generals in regard to the proper modes of employing cavalry , there was never any question of a similar nature as to the proper function of artillery . Differences of opinion there certainly were as to the organization of this arm ; attention has recently been called to them in an able paper by the late General Hunt , Chief of Artillery of the Army of the Potomac , read before the Military Historical Society of Massachusetts about a year before he died , and printed for the first time in the Journal of the Military Service Institution for March , 1891 . His conclusion is unquestionably sound ; it is " that with proper organization and administration our artillery in the Civil War , good as it was , might have been made more serviceable and produced greater results ; " but he admits , and in // fact claims , that the efficiency of this arm of the service in the late war was most marked . This was , by the way , as true of our adversaries as of ourselves . The American soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the beginning , the guns were well served . In process of time , the chiefs of artillery , as well of the various corps as of the armies themselves , came to be famous men . It was a pity that the full rank to which the Federal officers performing these duties were fairly entitled was never accorded to them by their Government . But the matter being a somewhat complicated one , Congress could never be got to pay proper attention to the organization of the artillery . Infantry , of course , constitutes the main body of all modern armies , and by the quality of its infantry an army must be judged . The capacity of Americans to make excellent soldiers was proved in the war beyond a question . That hundreds of thousands of men , most of them entirely unacquainted with the elements even of discipline and drill , were transformed in so brief a period into officers and soldiers was certainly one of the wonders of our time . But the material was in the main of the best ; the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there were from the beginning many opportunities for practising what had been learned . The armies of 1862 were far and away superior to the levies of 1861 . The armies of 1863 were decidedly superior to those of 1862 . But in 1863 it is probable that the highest point of efficiency was reached in both the Federal and Confederate armies in the East , and certainly in the Western army of the Confederacy . From the autumn of 1863 these three great armies began to become less serviceable . Let us see why . Take , first , the Army of the Potomac . This army , when it fought at Gettysburg , in July , 1863 , contained , it is true , some poor troops , but it contained few or no green regiments , and no raw recruits whatever . The officers and men were veterans , the greater part of whom had had two years service in the field . They had known victory and defeat ; they could march and they could fight ; they had had all sorts of experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that could happen to them . Had a proper policy been pursued in regard to the inevitable losse*-had the old regiments been kept up assiduously to the maximum strength , or to anything like the maximum strength , the Army of the Potomac would not only have been stronger at Gettysburg , but it would have gained in every way during the winter which ensued . It would have been superior in point of efficiency when it entered on the campaign of 1864 to the army which fought at Gettysburg , for the prestige of that great victory would have been the heritage of all its regiments , and would have inspired the new recruits as well as the old soldiers . But this great advantage was thrown away by the people of the North , or at least by the greater part of the Northern States . Instead of building up the old regiments , new ones were raised . Instead of utilizing the army 's capital , if we may so call it , of long service , thorough acquaintance with the duties of officers and soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , of dark and bloody days of defeat manfully and patiently borne , of glorious scenes of victory rewarding steadfast valor and unremitting energy  --  the greater part of the North blindly and recklessly threw it away . Veteran regiments , whose names and numbers had become deservedly famous , whose very traditions would forever have secured their efficiency , were allowed to waste away until they scarcely equalled a couple of full companies , and their places were taken by troops who had never smelt powder nor seen the face of the enemy . It is difficult to speak with patience of this wretched business . It is pleasanter to turn to those few States , which , like Wisconsin and Illinois , kept up to their full strength the regiments which had first gone out , and with whose names were associated the honor due from the State to the steadfast performance of duty and to gallant deeds of arms . But it is plain that no army reinforced in numbers as was the Army of the Potomac after the battle of // Gettysburg could be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that it must sensibly decline . The army with which Grant crossed the Rapidan on May 3 , 1864 , was no doubt larger by some twenty or thirty thousand men than that which began the battle of Gettysburg ; but among the old regiments was much worthless material-men whose enlistments had been induced by the extravagant bounties then paid by the States and cities of the East to get their quotas filled  --  and then there were plenty of absolutely new regiments , which had not been organized six months . On the other side of the river the army of Lee was weaker than it was at Gettysburg , for the very decisive reason that it had not been able to make up its losses in that terrible fight . It had seen its best days . And the same remark applies to the main Confederate army in the West . The sanguinary struggle of Chickamauga had cost the Confederates dear ; and , followed , as it was , by the recall of Longstreet 's corps to Virginia , and also by the rout of Missionary Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who replaced the unfortunate Bragg , to take the field with a force anything like as efficient as that which so fiercely attacked Rosecrans in September , 1863 . The national instinct on this subject is perfectly correct . It was at Gettysburg and Chickamauga that our American armies were at their best and did their best . Never were they-either before or after those memorable engagementsso strong , so well officered , so fierce , so determined to win , so resolved not to yield . They were then , we repeat , at their best-containing none but seasoned troops , under veteran officers , inured to war , both armies confident of victory , and pretty nearly , taking all things together , equally matched . And no one can read the story of those great battles without being proud of his country and his race , for never was there more resolute and obstinate and gallant fighting done , nor ever were severe losses more unshrinkingly borne . Nor can it be truly said of either of these battles that the beaten army did not fight as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is glory enough for all . Hence it is fitting that both fields-Gettysburg and Chickamauga-should be dedicated to the perpetual remembrance of the great battles so worthily fought there . It may have been noticed that the Federal army of the West was not included in the foregoing estimate . We are disposed to think that , unlike the armies of Johnston , Lee , and Grant , the army commanded by Sherman entered upon the campaign of 1864 in better condition in every respect than it ever was in before . It had had ample time to repair the losses of Chickamauga ; it had not been weakened , as had its antagonist , by the withdrawal of a part of its force for service elsewhere ; its losses at Missionary Ridge had not been large , and its success there had been of the most striking and brilliant kind . It was composed in the main of Western regiments that had enlisted in 1861 , and had , to a great extent , at least , been kept up to a fair average of strength by the wiser and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of recruiting their contingents , of which we have spoken above . Hence General Sherman 's army reaped the full benefit of all the most favorable military conditions that can affect the efficiency of an army . Its unity had been strictly preserved ; it had not been depleted by losses or by detachments , it had not been " watered " by the addition of raw troops . It was under a commander who was the idol of his men , whose great abilities were universally and cheerfully acknowledged , and who possessed the entire confidence of the general-in-chief and the Government at Washington . And these favorable conditions continued to the close of the war . In Sherman 's progress toward Atlanta , although it was marked at times by severe fighting , the losses were never excessive , considering the size of the army . While Grant , by his reckless and wasteful attacks , was throwing away his veterans ten thousand at a time , and in fact actually changing the very structure of the Army of the Potomac , his lieutenant in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had set // out from Dalton . There had been suffered , it is true , some losses that might have been avoided , but neither these nor the unavoidable casualties of the campaign , materially affected the identity or the strength of the command . The army which entered Atlanta was the army of Chickamauga and Missionary Ridge , of Peach Tree Creek and Decatur . Its career had been one of almost uniform success . The veteran troops had had their confidence in their leader and in themselves largely augmented by their experience in this campaign . They felt themselves strong enough for anything . They were ready for new tasks . They were full of enterprise and hope . And not only the admirably conducted march of Sherman to Savannah , and his still more brilliant march from Savannah to Goldsboro ' , but the resolute and steady resistance which Thomas was at the same time making to Hood 's invasion of Tennessee , crowned as it was by the decisive victory of Nashville , show , perhaps better than any other events in the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and boldly but judiciously managed , can accomplish . In the beginning of this paper we spoke of the magnitude of the task which the North proposed to itself . It was not without apparent reason that the world doubted and smiled in derision at the presumption of the Northern Government in thinking that it could succeed in such a gigantic undertaking . Was it possible that a nation with such an insignificant navy could establish an effective blockade over three thousand miles of sea-coast ? Did the Northern generals suppose that armies large enough to overcome the fierce and universal resistance which was to be expected could live on the country they were invading ? And if not , did not the great distances to be traversed render the problem of transportation and subsistence well nigh an insurmountable one ? Some successes , no doubt , the great superiority of the North in men and material might enable it to win ; very possibly the boundary might be pushed back a certain distance . But for the Northern forces to overrun the South , or to follow up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to maintain themselves in the midst of an unfriendly population and on a soil in great part destitute of the means of subsistence , as a great portion of the Southern Confederacy unquestionably was , seemed to many disinterested and clear-headed men of those days well-nigh impracticable . It is true that neither Lord Palmerston nor the Emperor Napoleon the Third inclined to the side of the North ; nevertheless we believe that it was not by any means wholly due to their unwillingness to see us succeed that they predicted our failure . We believe that they judged the probabilities of the case by the light of experience ; and , judging by the light of experience , it was not likely that the North would succeed if the South should resolutely persist in endeavoring to maintain her independence by force of arms . Lord Palmerston and the Emperor of the French were probably as well qualified to have an opinion on this subject as any two men in Europe ; the one had been Secretary at War from 1809 to 1815 , in the time of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been a diligent and intelligent student of the campaigns of his great uncle . Both these experts predicted the failure of the North . And it may safely be admitted that if the conditions of warfare had been the same in 1861 as they were in 1815 , or , in our judgment , as late as 1850 , their prediction would in all probability have been fulfilled . But the conditions were not the same . Steam and electricity had in the intervening time asserted their power , and had rendered possible for a McClellan or a Grant what had been impossible for a Napoleon . It was found that the capacity of the territory , through which it was proposed to move an army , for the task of supporting that army might generally be disregarded . It was found perfectly feasible to maintain a large force for any length of time in regions where no subsistence of any sort or kind was furnished by the soiL It was found that water-transportation of men and supplies was as certain and uniform , as much to be relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waves // of the ocean and the strength and direction of the flow of rivers could equally be ignored when it was proposed to transport troops , or subsistence , or ammunition , to a given spot . It was found that a blockade maintained by steam vessels , though not absolutely perfect , was a far more certain and constant check on foreign intercourse than could be effected by any employment of sailing vessels . By the telegraph all available resources could be utilized without the loss of a moment , and all information instantaneously communicated to or from headquarters to or from any part of the theatre of war . In other words , machinery had in the progress of time become one of the great factors in military operations , and its introduction worked as marked a revolution in the practice of commanders on land and sea , as its adoption for purposes of manufacture or of intercommunication had worked in the world of business and ordinary life . And , what was of the greatest importance to the North , the advantages of this great change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stronger and more wealthy of the two combatants . There had been but little in the way of example to follow . Steam-vessels had , it is true , supplied in great part the allied armies in the Crimea . There had also been a short railroad constructed for the accommodation of the English from Balaklava to the front , but it had taken a great while to build , and it was not very serviceable after it was built . The French and Austrians had also used their railroads in the short Italian war of 1859 . But there was really not much to serve as a precedent . The task of developing the possibilities of the use of steam and electricity in warfare was , therefore , first tried on a large scale in the war of secession . Naturally and inevitably it fell to the North to deal with the subject with the greater thoroughness and ingenuity of application . For the North could overcome the great natural difficulties presented by the geographical conditions under which the war was to be carried into the Confederacy only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powerful agency of steam , and the incalculable assistance afforded by the electric telegraph . And it will probably be conceded without demur , that no people ever lived more capable of making ingenious and useful applications of steam and electricity to war or to anything else , than the people of the Northern States . The first thing to do was to enlarge the navy so as to compass a blockade of the Southern coast , and the next thing was to build a navy for use on the great rivers which run through the heart of the Confederacy . That both tasks were successfully accomplished in a very brief period reflects the greatest credit on the officers of the navy . We have not time here , nor is this the place , to give the details ; but in a couple of months or thereabouts the blockade had become reasonably effective on the Atlantic seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico ; and , partly by purchasing river steamers and refitting them , and partly by building new and armorplated vessels , the Federal Government , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its tributaries , which laid those great avenues into the interior of the South open to the Northera invaders . The first fruit of the employment of this naval force in conjunction with the army was the capture of Fort Donelson in February , 1862 , with its entire garrison , entailing the evacuation by the Confederate General A. S. Johnston , of the greater part of the States of Kentucky and Tennessee . The task of providing subsistence and forage for the armies of both the North and South during the long months of winter and spring , when the roads were well-nigh impassable and the surrounding country afforded next to nothing which could be of service , was immensely simplified by railroads . It might be thought at first sight that the advantage of this arrangement lay with the army which was on the defensive , as their opponents would naturally be obliged to cut loose from their railroad communications in any forward movement . But it should be considered that the all-important thing for the North , whose resources so immeasurably exceeded those // of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get together at a point from which , as soon as the season opened , operations could be successfully commenced ; and that railroads and steamboats made it always possible for the North to accomplish this . Thus , during the winter of 1864 and 1865 , somewhere near 130,000 men were comfortably quartered and supplied in the Federal lines from Bermuda Hundred to Petersburg , in a country where absolutely nothing was furnished from the soil or by the inhabitants ; and when the time came , Grant was able to open the campaign with an overwhelming superiority of force . If the railroads now in operation in Russia had existed in Napoleon 's day , it may well be believed that he would have supplied his immense army with subsistence and forage during the winter of 1812 and 1813 , and would have made a success of his invasion . And , it may equally well be believed , that , had it not been for the railroads in France , the Prussians could never have maintained during the winter of 1870 and 1871 the enormous army which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks to a close . The war is now receiving at the hands of the American people its due measure of attention . Much of this is naturally devoted to the accumulation and arrangement of evidence , and to the elucidation of disputed questions of facts . Much of it is given to the study of the characters and actions of the prominent leaders , and to forming correct estimates of their respective shares in bringing about the great events of the time . Our principal object in writing the foregoing pages has been to draw a few of the military inferences and conclusions which , it seems to us , the narrative of the admitted facts warrants . This task of criticism has an importance of its own . For it is only by clearly perceiving and frankly recognizing the lessons taught by our own experience that we can hope to apprehend correctly the military problems of the future.
