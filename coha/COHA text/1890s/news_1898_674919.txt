txt The Berlin correspondent of The Times says the press teems with discussions of the Hispano-American war . " One point , " says the correspondent , " on which all agree is that if America has not yet reached her zenith , Spain has probably touched the nadir of her greatness . " The National Zeitung advises Spain to retire for a moment from the lists of the powers and devote herself to the cultivation of her land , and to rest satisfied in her Mediterranean interests , which still give her influence in all foreign questions . " The same paper thinks that America 's direct gain is small and that her weight as a great power is practically unchanged . The cause of this indication is found to be in the theory entertained here that a power withcut a vast standing army , drilled k. ' nd molded together into a spirit of absolute organic discipline , can not hope to face any other power In the proud possession of such an army , and it is doubted whether America will reorganize her army on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is clearly demonstrated by the writer when he says that 4,000,000 of raw soldiers will not much alter the situation . They must be drilled and taught the science of war if they are to be of use against armies obeying one voice , and moving as the wheels of an engine with one motion , impelled by one hand and directed against one end . " The Frankfurter Zeitung , on the contrary , thinks America has begun a new life and inaugurated a new policy of usefulness good for mankind . It says the American State is built on freedom and tolerance , untrammeled by the bureaucratic traditions which hamper older nations . Had Spain won , ' says the Zeitung , both nations would have been blighted by priestly absolutism , corruption , and relentless despotism . ' " The Zeitung considers the Philippines a question where America must prove herself worthy by the position she has won and undertaken to uphold . "
