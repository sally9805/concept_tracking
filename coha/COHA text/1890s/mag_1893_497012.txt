PHILLIPS BROOKS 'S LETTERS TO CHILDREN.1 WITH NOTES ON HIS HOME LIFE . IE following letters were written by the late Bishop Brooks to the children of his eldest brother during his various journeys , beginning with one made in 1882-83 , which extended over a year and included the journey to India . Sailing from New York in the Servia about the middle of June , 1882 , he was joined by the Rev. Dr. McVickar of Philadelphia , and the Rev. Mr. Franks of Salem , who remained with him for two months , traveling in England , France , and Italy . Later Mr. H. H. Richardson , the architect , with a young friend joined the party in France , and they all continued together for several weeks . When they separated , Dr. Brooks went to Germany , where he visited several of the university towns , making Berlin his headquarters , and remaining there long enough to look into its university life , and to learn something of its great men and its theology . Late in November he was joined at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journey into India . This journey most successfully accomplished , Mr. Wendell left him at Cairo , and Dr. Brooks , after a little tour into Spain , returned to England , where he spent a delightful two months , seeing much of its great people . Here he was joined in July by Mr. Robert Treat Paine of Boston , and after another fortnight on the Continent he took the steamship Ce*halonia at Liverpool on September 12 , reaching Boston on September 22 . This was an eventful day to many households throughout the city . Members of his family , who were scattered , gathered to meet him and to celebrate his return with festivities ; and it was pleasant to see how naturally and happily he fell into the old ways after a year of delightful recreation . One likes to recur to the family festivals , which , through his busy life , he never failed to observe with scrupulous care . Upon the removal of his father and mother to North Andover , he arranged that the rectory in Boston should be the family gathering-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were within reach , and to them this was a great occasion . For several weeks beforehand the young people were interested in arranging for a " surprise " in the way of some simple entertainment , which followed the dinner and occupied the evening ; and it was considered a great privilege to be allowed to " dress up " in the silks and stuffs and trinkets that had been brought from India by their uncle , who would guide them in the arrangement of their costumes , and afterward make one of the audience and greet them with hearty applause . Several dolls were kept in a closet of the rectory for the entertainment of his nieces when they should chance to drop in . He took especial pains on these occasions to make his table attractive to the children . Every appointment was marked by his most refined taste , which never seemed to err even in the 1 The following letters are selected from a volume of " Letters of Travel , " to be issued by Bishop Brooks 's publishers , E.

Dutton &amp; Co. // smallest matter . His love for flowers was evident in his selection and arrangement of them . The ornaments and bonbons were unusual , and were carefully selected , and at the close of the dinner the children were requested to carry away all that remained of the prettiest of them . Once his ices represented a group of kittens , and his play with them was the source of much amusement to the children and himself . The costume favors , too , were always there , and each one present was expected to wear his or her paper cap throughout the dinner , his own towering above the others . The Christmas season was a great delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , and was deeply interested in the children 's festival at Trinity Church , where there was always a tree of rare beauty . He was usually present at the dressing of the tree , and entered into its spirit more than did the children themselves . Year after year , on one of the days of the week before Christmas , he would arrange to have the younger members of his family breakfast with him to decide about their presents , after which he spent several hours with them in roaming about through the shops to make their selections . Once when it was suggested that the family gifts be omitted for one year , on the score that too much time and thought had to be given to them , he was so much shocked that the suggestion was never repeated , and he would insist upon having his gifts , no matter how trifling , and never failed to give rare and beautiful ones to others . For many years a part of Christmas Day was passed in company with his brother 's family at the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which preceded Christmas by a few weeks , was celebrated at his brother 's with great merrymaking . His chair was dressed with flags and ribbons , and there was a birthday cake , until the number of candles necessary to mark the age increased to so many that it was thought well to abolish it . But there was always a tray filled with gifts , which was brought on with the dessert , and he was usually quite impatient until the time came for presenting them , and would sometimes insist upon shortening the dinner . For all such days the children were provided with a rhyme , which never failed to excite his interest , poor as it might be . It was suited to the day , and addressed to him , and was sung to some lively tune , to which he would keep time with his hand as they sang it again and again at his request . We now come to the letters : VENICE , August 13 , 1882 . DEAR GERTIE : When the little children in Venice want to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house and jump off and swim about in the street . Yesterday I saw a nurse standing on the front steps , holding one end of a string , and the other end was tied to a little fellow who was swimming up the street . When he went too far , the nurse pulled in the string , and got her baby home again . Then I met another youngster , swimming in the street , whose mother had tied him to a post by the side of the door , so that when he tried to swim away to see another boy who was tied to another door-post up the street , he could n't , and they had to sing out to one another over the water . Is not this a queer city ? You are always in danger of running over some of the people and drowning them , for you go about in a boat instead of a carriage , and use an oar instead of a horse . But it is ever so pretty , and the people , especially the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you are sitting in your room at night , you hear some music under your window , and look out , and there is a boat with a man with a fiddle , and a woman with a voice , and they are serenading you . To be sure , they want some money when they are done , for everybody begs here , but they do it very prettily and are full of fun . Tell Susie I did not see the queen this time . She was out of town . But ever so many noblemen and princes have sent to know how Toody was , and how she looked , and I have sent them all her love . There must be lots of pleasant things to do at Andover , and I think you must have had a beautiful summer there . Pretty soon now you will go back to Boston . Do go into my house when you get there and see if the doll and her baby are well and happy , but do not carry them off ; and make the music-box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHILLIPS . WURTZBURG , October is , 1882 . Mv DEAR GERTIE : I owe you a letter-indeed I am afraid that I owe you more than one , but we wo n't be very particular about that . You shall write as often as you can , and so will I , and then we will call it square . You ought to have a great deal more to say than I , because Boston is a great deal livelier place than Wurtzburg , and besides you have lived in Boston all your life , and know lots of people there whom I should like to hear about ( including Susie ) , while I have been here only since yesterday , and only know one person here , and you would not care to hear about him , for he is only a stupid old professor . But you would like to go down the queer old streets and see the funny houses , and you would have liked to see the big church , crowded with people , that I saw this afternoon , and heard them sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints down off the walls . I wish that once before I die I could hear the people sing like that in Trinity Church in Boston . But I never shall . It was a great day in the church here to-day , because it was the thousalidth anniversary of the death of the man who built the first church here , long before you were born , and so they had a great procession and went // The picture is a little chromo pasted by the writer at the head of the note. - EDITOR. 505 233 eLAwNDON*TR.rET .

I wish you had been there with me . Then there is a tremendous great palace where the bishops used to live , about ten thousand times as large as the house that Bishop Paddock lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because bishops are not such great people as they used to be ; but you can go through it all and see the splendid rooms , and there is the loveliest old garden behind it with fountains and statues , and beautiful old trees , where the people go and walk about on pleasant afternoons , and a band plays . If you and I ever spend an afternoon in Wurtzburg , we will go there . I wonder if you have been at Trinity to-day , and who preached , and whether you know the text , and whether Sunday-school has begun ? I am on my way from Heidelberg to Berlin . After I have stayed there for a week or two , I shall go to Dresden and Prague and Vienna and Venice , and I have got a ticket to sail in the Poonak from Venice for Bombay on the ist day of December .

I wish you would come to Venice and see me off as you did to New York . Good night and pleasant dreams . Give my love to everybody , and do n't forget your affec tionate uncle , PHILLIPs . WITTENBERG , Sunday , September 24,1882 . Mv DEAR AGNES : ... Did you ever hear of Wittenberg ? You will find it on the map , not very far from Berlin . It used to be a very famous place when Martin Luther lived here and was preaching his sermons in the church whose clock I just now heard strike a quarter of one , and was writing his books in the room whose picture is at the top of this sheet of paper . I am sure you know all about Luther . If not , ask Toody . She knows most everything . ... It is a queer old town . Just now , when it was twelve o'clock , I heard some music and looked out and found that a band of music was playing psalm-tunes away up in the air , on the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came here from Berlin yesterday , and am going : to travel about in Germany for a few weeks , and then go back to Berlin again . Berlin is very nice . I wish I could tell you about a visit which I made on Friday to one of the great public schools , where I saw a thousand boys and a thousand girls , and the way they spelt the hard words in German would have frightened you to death . Your affectionate uncle , PHILLIPS . Very Private I ! GRAND HOTEL , VIENNA , Nov. 19 , 1882 . DEAR GERTIE : This letter is an awful secret between you and me . If you tell anybody about it , I will not speak to you all this winter . And this is what it is about . You know Christmas is coming , and I am afraid that I shall not get home by that time , and so I want you to go and get the Christmas presents for the children . The grown people will not get any from me this year . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you must find out , in the most secret way , just what Agnes and Toodie would most like to have , and get it and put it in their stockings on Christmas Eve . Then you must ask yourself what you want , and get it too , but without letting yourself know about it , and put it in your own stocking and be very much surprised when you find it there . And then you must sit down and think about Josephine De Wolf and the otherbaby at Springfield whose name I do not know , and consider what they would like , and have it sent to them in time to reach them upon Christmas Eve . Will you do all this for me ? You can spend $* for each child , and if you show your father this letter he will give you the money out of some of mine which he has got . That ratherbreaks the secret , but you will want to consult your father and mother about what to get , especially for the Springfield children , so you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let any of the children know of it until Christmas-time . Then you can tell me in your Christmas letter just how you have managed about it all . . Perhaps you will get this on Thanksgiving Day . If you do , you must shake the turkey 's paw for me , and tell him that I am very sorry I could not come this year , but I shall be there next year certain ! Give my love to all the children . I had a beautiful letter from Aunt Susan the other day , which I am going to answer as soon as it stops raining . Tell her so , if you see her . Be a good girl , and do not study too hard , and keep our secret . Your affectionate uncle , PHILLIPS . J EYPORE , January 7 , 1883 . Mv DEAR GERTIE : I wish you had been here with me yesterday . We would have had a beautiful time . You would have had to get up at five o'clock , for at six the carriage was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country you do everything you can very early , so as to escape the hot sun . It is very hot in the middle of the day , but quite cold now at night and in the mornings and the evenings . Well , as we drove into the town ( for the bungalow where we are staying is just outside ) , the sun rose and all the streets // were full of light . The town is all painted pink , which makes it the queerest-looking place you ever saw ; and on the outsides of the pink houses there are pictures drawn , some of them very solemn , and some of them very funny , which makes it very pleasant to drive up the street . We drove through the street , which was crowded with camels and elephants and donkeys , and women wrapped up like bundles , and men chattering like monkeys , and monkeys themselves , and naked little children rolling in the dust and playing queer Jeypore games . All the little girls , when they get to be about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women all have their noses looking beautiful in this way . I have got a nose-jewel for you , which I shall put in when I get home , and also a little button for the side of Susie 's nose , such as the smaller children wear . Think how the girls at school will admire you ! Well , we drove out the other side of the queer pink town , and went on toward the old town which they deserted a hundred years ago , when they built this . The priest told the rajah , or king , that they ought not to live more than a thousand years in one place , and so , as the old town was about a thousand years old , the king left it , and there it stands about five miles off with only a few beggars and a lot of monkeys for inhabitants of its splendid palaces and temples . As we drove along toward it , the fields were full of peacocks and all sorts of bright-winged birds , and out of the ponds and streams the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hills around are full of tigers and hyenas , but they do not come down to the town , though I saw a cage of them there which had been captured only about a month and they were very fierce . Poor things ! When we came to the entrance of the old town there was a splendid great elephantwaitingforus , which the rajahhad sent . He sent the carriage , too . The elephant had his head and trunk beautifully painted , and looked almost as big as Jumbo . He knelt down and we climbed up by a ladder and sat upon his back , and then he toiled up the hill . I am afraid he thought Americans must be very heavy , and I do not know whether he could have carried you . Behind us , as we went up the hill , came a man leading a little black goat , and when I asked what it was for they said it was for sacrifice . It seems a horrid old goddess has a temple on the hill , and years ago they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy and kind . But a merciful rajah stopped that and made them sacrifice goats instead , and now they give the horrid old goddess a goat every morning , and she likes it just as well . When we got into the old town it was a perfect wilderness of beautiful things-lakes , 507 temples , palaces , porticos , all sorts of things in marble and fine stones , with sacred long-tailed monkeys running over all . But I must tell you all about the goddess and the way they cut off the poor little goat 's little black head , and all the rest that I saw , when I get home . Do n't you wish you had gone with me ? Give my love to your father and mother and Agnes and Susie . I am dying to know about your Christmas and the presents . Do not forget your affectionate uncle , PHILLIPS . S. S. VERONA , Sunday , March i8 , 1883 . Mv DEAR GERTIE : It seems to me that our correspondence has not been very lively lately . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I was in India . I hoped I should , because I wanted to show it to the rajahs , and other great people , and let them see what beautiful letters American children can write . But now I am out of India , and for the last ten days we have been sailing on there about six hours . I went on shore and took a drive through the town and up into the country . If you had been with me you would have seen the solemn-looking camels stalking along with solemn-looking Arabs on their backs , looking as if they had been riding on and on that way ever since the days of Abraham . I think I met Isaac and Jacob on two skinny camels , just outside the gates of Aden . I asked them how Esau was , but Jacob looked mad and would n't answer , and hurried the old man on , so that I had no talk with them ; but I feel quite sure it was they , for they looked just like the pictures in the Bible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on Monday evening we shall be once more at Suez , and there I say good-by to my companion , who stops in Egypt , and goes thence to Palestine , while I hurry on to Malta and Gibraltar in the same steamer . She is a nice little steamer , with a whole lot of children on board , who fight all the while and cry the rest of the time . Every now and then one of them almost goes overboard , and then all the mothers set up a great howl , though I do n't see why they should care very much about such children as these are . I should think it would be rather a relief to get rid of them . Now , if it were you , or Agnes , or Tood , it would be different ! There has just been service on deck , and I preached , and the people all held on to something and listened . I would a great deal rather preach in Trinity . I hope you will have a pleasant Easter . Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next year // I hope you will come and dine with me on Easter Day . Do n't forget ! My love to Tood . Your affectionate uncle , PHILLIPS . ON THE P. AND 0 . STEAMSHIP VERONA , NEAR SUEZ , March 19 , 1883 . LITTLE MISTRESS JOSEPHINE , 1 Tell me , have you ever seen Children half as queer as these Babies from across the seas ? See their funny little fists , See the rings upon their wrists ; One has very little clothes , One has jewels in her nose ; And they all have silver bangles On their little heathen ankles . In their ears are curious things , Round their necks are beads in strings , And they jingle as they walk , And they talk outlandish talk . One , you see , has hugged another , Playing she s its little mother . One , who sits all lone and loin , Has her head all shaved and shorn . Do you want to know their names ? One is called Jeefungee Hames , One Buddhanda Arrich Bas , One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the streets of old Jeypore . They never seemed to cry or laugh , But , sober as the photograph , Squatted in the great bazaars , While the Hindoos , their mamas , Quarreled long about the price Of their little mess of rice ; And then , when the fight was done , Every mother , one by one , Up her patient child would whip , Set it straddling on her hip , And trot off all crook 'd and bent To some hole where , well content , Hers and baby 's days are spent . Are n't you glad then , little Queen , That your name is Josephine ? That you live in Springfield , or Not , at least , in old Jeypore ? That your Christian parents are John and Hattie , Pa and Ma ? That you ye an entire nose And no rings upon your toes ? In a word , that Hat and you Do not have to be Hindoo ? But I thought you d like to see What these little heathen be , And give welcome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rev. J. C. Brooks . GIBRALTAR , April i , 1883 . Mv DEAR GERTIE : I am so sorry that you have been ill . If you had only come with me on the Servia , and not stayed at home to work so hard over your lessons , I do not believe you would have been ill at all . At Malta we saw the church where all the old Knights of Malta are buried , and the armor which they used to wear , and then there is a queer old church which the monks have the care of , and when a monk dies they do not bury him underground , or burn him up with fire , which would be better , but they stand him up in a niche , in his monk 's frock , and leave him there ; and there they are , a whole row of dry monks , dreadful-looking things , with their labels on them , to tell who they used to be when they were alive . Well , Wednesday afternoon we left Malta and sailed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen on the Verona all the way . The people were not very interesting . Only Miss G. got engaged to the fourth officer , and that interested us all very much indeed ; and one morning Audley D. and Lawrence K. got into a great fight on deck , and Audley D. hit Lawrence K. in the eye and hurt him , and then the two mothers , Mrs. D. and Mrs. K. , went at each other and scolded terribly . And that also interested us very much indeed . This is about all I can think of that happened on board the Verona . I ca n't tell you much about Spain yet , for I have only been in it about an hour and a half . The people talk . Spanish , which is very awkward , but the sailing up to Gibraltar this morning was splendid . The narrow gate of the Mediterranean , with its two great rocks , one in Europe and one in Africa , was all ablaze with the morning sun , and through it , westward , lay America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then to Granada . Give my love to everybody . Your affectionate uncle , PHILLIPS . WESTMINSTER PALACE HOTEL , LONDON , June 3 , 1883 . Mv DEAR TooD : Your wicked papa has not sent me any letter this week , and so I am not going to write to him to-day ; but I am going to answer your beautiful letter , which traveled all the way to London , and was delivered here by a postman with a red coat , two or three weeks ago . He looked very proud when he came in , as if he knew that he had a beautiful letter in his bundle , and all the people in the street stood aside to make way for him , so that Tood 's letter might not be delayed . How quickly you have learned to read and write ! I am very sorry for you , for they now will make you read and study a great many // all your days . When I get home I am going to make you write my sermons for me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of twenty cents a month , with which you can buy no end of gum-drops . If you do not know what an amanuensis is , ask Agnes , and tell her I will bring her a present if she can spell it right the first time . Poor little Gertie ! What a terrible time she has had ! It must have been very good for her to have you to take care of her and run her errands and play with her and write her letters . I suppose that is the reason why you hurried so and learned to write . It was a great pity that I never got her letter about the Christmas presents , but I am very glad that you liked the cou . What do you want me to bring you home from London ? Write me another letter and tell me , and tell Gertie I shall be very happy when I get another letter from her , written with her own little fingers . I want to see your new house , which I am sure will be very pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . Now , I am going off to preach in a queer old church , built almost a thousand years ago , before your father or mother was born . Give my love to them , and to Agnes and to Gertie , and to the new doll . Your affectionate uncle , PHILLIPS . WESTMINSTER PALACE HOTEL , July io , 1883 . Mv DEAR CERTIE : How dreadfully ill you must have been ! Everybody here has been terribly anxious about you , and now is so glad to hear that you are really a great deal better . I heard you talked about on Sunday at the Army and Navy Hotel , and it made me almost feel as if I were at home to hear your name so often . And now I wonder where you are . I hope they have carried you off to some cool , pleasant baths where you will melt the rheumatism out of you and make you just as nice and limber as a doll . I wish you were here , for it is beautifully fresh and cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . I went down into the country the other day , and saw some people whom I met on the journey home from India . It was the prettiest place , and you would have enjoyed it ever so much . They had the biggest strawberries you ever saw , and you would have enjoyed picking them a great deal more than I did . I wish strawberries grew on trees . They would be so much easier to pick . There was a nice little girl there , who was a great friend of mine on the voyage . Her name is Nora , and she gave me her photograph . I think I will put it into this letter , so that you can see what an English child looks like , only 509 you must keep it safe and give it to me when I get to Boston , for I told Nora Buchanan that I should keep it till I saw her again . Her father has a tea-plantation up in the Himalaya Mountains , and her mother and she go out there every winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big dog and a little dog and lots of pets . When we get to living up in the old house at Andover , we will have some dogs too , and perhaps some day we will get a pony for you to ride on - or would you rather have a donkey with long ears and a delightful little cart to drive in ? What did you do on the Fourth of July ? The people here seemed to think that it was just like any other day . Nobody was firing crackers , or blowing soap-bubbles , and there were no American flags flying anywhere ; but one day two weeks ago London was greatly excited , it being the Queen 's coronation day , and I met the Lord Mayor in his coach with a red cloak on and a big gold chain around his neck . . . . Thank you for your little note . Your loving uncle , Sunday , August is , 1883 . DEAR GERTIE : I bought the prettiest thing you ever saw foryou the other day . If you were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could not guess what it is . I shall not tell you , because I want you to be all surprised to pieces when you see it , and I am so impatient to give it to you that I can hardly wait . Only you must be in a great hurry and get well , because you see it is only five weeks from to-day that I shall expect to see you in the dear old study in Clarendon street , where we have had such a lot of good times together before now . Just think of it ! We 11 set the music-box a-going , and light all the gaslights in the house , and get my doll out of her cupboard , and dress Tood up in a red pockethandkerchief and stand her tip on the study table , and make her give three cheers ! Then we 11 have some gingerbread and lemonade . I ye got a lot of things for you besides the one which I bought for you the other day . You could n't guess what it is if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , and when you see it you will jump the rheumatism right out of you . I hope you will be quite well by that time . What sort of a place is Sharon ? Do not write to me about it , but tell me all about it when I see you . What a lot you will have to tell ! You can tell me what was in that Christmas letter which the wicked mail-man never brought to me . Good-by , dear little girl . Do n't you wish you knew what it was that I bought for you the other day ? Give my love to Agnes and Tood . Your affectionate uncle , P. // JNNSBRUCK , August 26 , 1883 . DEAR GERTIE : How I envy the little Tyrolese girls their health and strength to-day ! I wanted to steal half of it and send it home in a box to you . They never would have missed it , for they have a great deal more health than they know what to do with . Their cheeks are as red as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of such a thing as rheumatism ! But never mind ; I am coming home soon now , and you xviii forget all about this ugly winter . I have been seeing the people in a little village to-day act a part of the New Testament story . A lot of the children took part in it , and I send you a photograph of one of them , a little girl who walked in the procession which came with Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday . She was a cunning little thing , and carried her palm branch as you see , and cried " Hosanna ! " as she walked along . I wish you had been there to see her . XVas it not funny that I should hear about you on the street at Innsbriick ? You see how famous you are , and how people know about you all over the world . The person who knew about you here was Miss XV. , who came out of a shop last Friday afternoon just as we were going in . She looked just like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters from home about your visit to Sharon , or perhaps she saw it in the papers ! I wonder if you will be back when I get home , and I wonder if you will be glad to see me ! I got you another present the other day , but you could n't guess what that is , either . Good-by ! Get well ! And give my love to Agnes and Tood . I think of you a great deal . Your affectionate uncle , * MUNICH , September 2 , 1883 . DEAR GERTIE : When I came away the first man th&amp;t wrote me a letter , only two days after the Servia had steamed out of New York Bay , was you . And now that I am coming home , the last letter which I write from the Old World to any man in America shall be to you . For I want to tell you myself that I shall see you on September 22 . I suppose you will not be quite able to run over to the wharf at East Boston when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up to see you just as soon as the custom-house people let me out of prison , after I have paid the duties upon all the heaps of presents I have got for you ! Was n't it good that the baths at Sharon helped you so much ? I was at a place the other day where the people take baths for rheumatism . It is called Bad Gastein , but it is n't bad at all . It is very good . It is away back in the hills , and there s a tremendous waterfall which runs right through the house , and keeps up such a racket that you ca n't get any sleep . But that does no great harm , because you have to take your bath so early that if it was not for the waterfall in the next room , you would sleep over and never get your bath at all , and so some time you might have the rheumatism all your life . I did n't have any rheumatism , so I went and took a bath for yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much better . You thought it was the baths you were taking at Sharon , but it really was the bath I was taking at Bad Gastein ! I wonder how soon you will come and see me when I get back . Everybody here eats his breakfast , and luncheon , and dinner outdoors . I like it , and think I shall do so myself when I get home ; so when you come to breakfast we will have our table out on the grass-plot on Newbury street , and Katie shall bring us our beefsteak there . Wo n't the children stare as they go by to school ? We 11 toss the crumbs to them and the robins . But you must hurry and get well , or we can not do all this . My love to Agnes and Tood . Your affectionate uncle , * In the summer of 1885 Dr. Brooks , in company with Mr. Robert Treat Paine and family of Boston , made a tour through parts of England and Europe . In the following letters he frequently refers to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors , which fell into his hands upon the death of the last of the generation preceding his own .

In this life of seclusion he found the quiet and rest that seemed to be absolutely necessary to him , and he was able to accomplish much reading and other work for which it was difficult to find time at other seasons of the year , when duties were pressing upon him . Each summer he would bring with him a great box of books that he had accumulated during the year . Here , too , he did the necessary work toward preparing his sermons for the publisher . The days were uneventful and singularly alike , and if they grew to be monotonous , and he felt the need of more life , he would answer one or more of the many calls from friends eager to welcome him to their homes . From time to time , too , he would gather his friends about him ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ,  --  and would delight in showing them the old home and the country that had been dear to him from his boyhood . His mornings he devoted wholly to work . Certain hours of each day were given to the children , whose lives and amusements he entered into so fully . The old Corn Barn to which he refers so often was set aside for them as a retreat or play-house  --  a rude old place , which he took great pleasure in fitting up , bringing some toy or bit of decoration for it each time that he came from Boston . Here were Japanese lanterns , // and Indian pictures , and tables and chairs-one great arm-chair for himself , in which he would sit and watch with great interest the children at work upon a little cooking-stove ( also his gift ) preparing certain dishes , of which they were always quite sure to find him ready to partake , although they were not very inviting and showed the marks of frequent handling . Again he might be found at work with hammer and nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of one of the players he would always be ready to rehearse a part . Thus he entered into their daily lives and amusements , helping them and shielding them , and never thinking anything too small for his interest and care . The Fourth of July was a great day at the old place . All through the day he would fire off his crackers with the enthusiasm of a boy , and in the evening he would send off his rockets with equal interest , laughing heartily when his pinwheels would not go , and at the rockets that would sometimes dart from him across the lawn instead of up into the sky . The chief event of each day for the young people was the afternoon drive with him in his buggy . Each watched anxiously for the invitation to accompany him . If they chanced to drive through a town , he would frequently stop and buy presents for those that were left behind ,  --  only a simple toy perhaps , but enough to compensate for the loss of the drive . After answering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family for a game such as " Authors , " or gomachy , " and the like , and it was astonishing to see the interest and childlike simplicity with which he entered into these games night after night . He was always ready for " another , " while everybody about him , tired of being beaten ( for he was very apt to beat ) , would long to drop away . After the family had retired , he would settle down to read until midnight , when he too retired . Thus Phillips Brooks passed the days in this quietest of old New England towns , and one who was privileged to see much of him , and whose children were brought close to him through a close relationship , ventures to give to those who would be interested to know something of this side of him , a few incidents of family life in connection with these letters . We now come to the series of 1885 . WESTMINSTER PALACE HOTEL , June 12 , i88* . DEAR GERTIE : . . . I have been running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing alot of people , and every now and then going off into the country , which is wonderfully pretty now , with hawthorn and lilacs and laburnums all in bloom . Last Sunday I went out to Harrow , where there is a great school , and there I preached to five hundred boys . How A would like to go there , would n't she ? In the afternoon I came back into town , and preached in Westminster Abbey to a great host of people . The great place looked splendidly , and it was fine to preach there . Yesterday I went twenty miles into the country , and preached at an ordination of forty new ministers . The fields were bright with daisies , and I wondered how North Andover was looking . You must be just packing up to go there now . Even with all the beauty of England , it makes me quite homesick when I think about it . You must tell me all about the removal there , and how you get settled , and how your Corn Barn looks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old place ; and you must have it all ready for me on September 12 , when I mean to come up early in the morning and spend the whole solid week quietly there . That will be just three months from to-day . . . . I go to Cambridge for next Sunday , and then to Oxford for Commemoration and my degree . Good-by . My best of love to all and you . Affectionately , UNCLE P. WESTMINSTER PALACE HOTEL , LONDON , June iS , i88* . MYTOOD : ... I havejust come back from Oxford . You should have seen me yesterday walking about the streets in my doctor 's gown . It was a red gown with black sleeves , and is awfully pretty . It was only hired for the occasion , for it costs ever so much money and I did not care to buy one . So you will never see how splendidly I looked in it , for I shall never have it on again . . Affectionately your uncle , * BONN , July ii , i88* . DEAR GERTIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , and a church tower just across the river , and the little boats keep coming and going , and the children on the bank in front of the hotel are playing like kittens , and everything is as bright and sunshiny as if there was n't such a thing as trouble in the world . Speaking of kittens , I wonder if you have found the little thing that used to hide away in the barn , and that the boy could n't catch for a quarter of a dollar . But perhaps she has grown to be a big cat , and is n't worth the catching now , which is the way with a good many people . When you want them you can not get them , and when you can get them you do n't want them . There is a man just come and set up a stand in the square under my window to sell cherries , and the children are looking at them hard and no doubt wishing that they had two cents . I would give them two dollars apiece all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . And so we all want something which we have not got . I wonder what you want . If it s anything in Europe , write a letter and tell me the name of it instantly , and I will get it for you . . . Your uncle , P. // BELLAGIO , July 30 , i88* . Mv DEAR GERTIE : It is a beautiful warm morning on the Lake of Como ,  --  so warm that one does not feel like doing anything but sitting still and writing a lazy letter to a dear little girl in America . The water as I look out of the window is a delicious blue , and the sweet green hills on the other side of the lake are sound asleep in the sunlight , which they like . There is a garden of palm-trees and oleanders right under my window , and the oleanders are all in gorgeous bloom . A boatman is waiting at the marble steps in case anybody wants his boat ; but I think he hopes that nobody will want it , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , when it gets cooler , I shall change all this and start up to the mountains , and by to-morrow night I shall be at St. Moritz among the glaciers and snow-banks . But wherever I am , I am thinking how very pleasant it must be in the old house , and what a good time we will have when I get back there six weeks from next Monday afternoon . We will not make any plans for excursions , but just stay quiet on the big piazza , and now and then , when we feel very energetic , make a long trip to the Corn Barn . Everybody must come and see us ; we will not go to see anybody . Your affectionate uncle , * CHAMOUNIX , August is , i885 . DEAR GERTIE : Mont Blanc has put his head under a cloud , and there is nothing to be seen outside except a lot of guides and porters , waiting for the diligence to come from Geneva . So before the dinner-bell rings I will send off my week 's letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next week 's , which will be the last that I shall write , shall be to her , for she has been a good little girl and written me beautiful letters all summer . So have you . I got your letter here last night with the picture of the bird-house in the garden on the side of the paper . After you get this letter , remember that you are not to do a single thing exciting until I get home , so that you will be all fresh and strong to play with me . I hope the heat will be all over then . It must have been dreadful . Everybody who writes me talks about it . Only two weeks from to-day ! Just think of it ! Two weeks from now the beautiful Pavozzia will be steaming away down the Channel bound for North Andover , and three weeks from next Sunday I shall stand up in Trinity again . You can not think how splendid the great mountain was last night . The sky was perfectly clear and the moon was glorious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The people stood and gazed at it and looked solemn . This morning it had changed , but was no less beautiful . It was like a great mass of silver . And so it stands there , and changes from one sort of beauty to another , year after year , and age after age . I think you must have had a beautiful time this summer with the pony , and next year we must try to have one of our own . Make up your mind what kind and color he shall be , and we will look about and see what we can find when I get home . It must be a great sight to see Tood driving all by her blessed self , and all the fast horses on the road getting out of the way for fear she will run over them . Perhaps you and she can drive me out to Cambridge mornings in November . Good-by now . Affectionately your uncle , * GRAND HOTEL , PARIS , August 27 , 1885 . Mv DEAR TooD : ... I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time of life that I know , and when you drop into poetry it is beautiful . So I will thank you when I get home , and we will sit in the shadow of the Corn Barn and talk it all over . Paris is very bright and gay and pretty . Yesterday I went out to the Jardin d'Acclimatation ( say that if you can ) , and the monkeys were awfully funny . How would it do to get three monkeys for North Andover , and tie them to a post in the side yard and see them play and fight ? How would Tom like it ? And do you think it would please Johnnie , or would he only think they were some more Brooks children ? I am afraid you have not seen much ofJohnnie this year . That is not wise . For he is a very brilliant little boy , and it would be a great advantage to you and Agnes if you talked with him . . . . Your affectionate uncle , * In the spring of i886 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond tourists in a journey across the Western country to San Francisco , returning home early in July . We conclude this paper with a single letter written on this trip : DENVER , June 20 , i886 . DEAR Toon : When I got here last night I found the hotel man very much excited and running about , waving a beautiful letter in the air , and crying aloud , " A letter from Tood ! A letter from Tood ! " He was just going to get out a band of music to march around the town and look for the man to whom the letter belonged , when I stepped up and told him I thought that it was meant for me . He made me show him my name in my hat before he would give it to me , and then a great crowd gathered round and listened while I read it . It was such a beautiful letter that they all gave three cheers , and I thought I must write you // an answer at once , although I told Agnes when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write to anybody else before my coming home . Your letter is very largely about Johnnie . My dear Tood , you must not let his going away depress you too much . I know you like him , and that he has been very good to you ; but such separations have to come , and you will no doubt see some other young man some day that you will like just as much . You do not think so now , but you will , and he no doubt feels very bad at going , so you must be as cheerful as you can and make it as easy as possible for him . Remember ! I am on my way home now , and next Saturday will see me back again in Clarendon street . All the dear little Chinese , with their pigtails , and the dreadful , great Mormons , with their hundred wives , and the donkeys and the buffaloes and the red Indians will be far away , and I shall see you all again . I am impatient for that , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am going to preach to them this morning to try and make them better , and it is quite time now to go to church . Your affectionate uncle , P.
