txt Commodore Elbridge T. Gerry was to-day expelled from the floor of the Assembly . Ten minutes later , on motion of Senator Guy ( Dem. , New-York , ) he was unanimously tendered the freedom of the floor of the Senate , as a palliative for the wound to his sensibilities by the undeserved action of the House . He was then warmly congratulated by the twentyeight Senators who voted yesterday for his Whipping-Post bill . The Commodore in his characteristically nervous fashion has been doing some effective work for the bill since his arrival here . This morning , however , he was talking of college days with Assemblyman Philip Keck , who like the Commodore , is a Hamilton College man . Clerk Archie Baxter had just finished reading committee reports , when Assemblyman Alonzo Bell of the Twenty-ninth New York , who was Chief Clerk of the Department of the Interior from 1875 to 1877 , and who was Assistant Secretary of that department for six years , claimed the attention of the House by uttering these words ; " Mr. Speaker , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce the rule with reference to lobbying . I notice on the floor of the House a gentleman who is in favor of the Whipping-Post bill . " Every eye in the chamber glanced toward Elbridge T. Gerry , President of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children , who was seated at the side of Mr. Foley . " The Sergeant at Arms will enforce the rule , " said Speaker Fish . No one stirred , and Mr. Gerry calmly looked up at the Speaker . Throwing his voice- several notes higher than usual , the Speaker repeated the order . Whereupon , Chief Doorkeeper Bauer , in the absence of Sergeant at Arms Benson , walked down to Mr. Gerry , touched him on the arm , and escorted him to the rear of the rail . Here the Commodore stood and complacently listened to the debate that Mr. Bell 's suggestion precipitated . It remained for two Democrats to defend Commodore Gerry . - Mr. Foley , the Democratic leader , protested against the action . He said that it was his idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . While he was not now , he had been a State officer , and was entitled to respect . Speaker Fish stated that Mr. Gerry was not now an officer , and could not remain on the , floor . " Then , Mr. Speaker , " said Mr. Foley , " I now move that the privileges of the floor be accorded to the Hon. Eibridge T. Gerry . " " The Chair objects , " the Speaker : said , " to any one remaining on the floor who is interested in the bill . " Mr. Stanchileld stepped into . the centre aisle , claimed Speaker Fish 's attention , and said he thought Mr. Gerry was entitled to some consideration . He was on the floor only for social purposes , and was not there in the interest of any bill . The gentleman from New-York ( Mr. Bell ) had insulted Mr. Gerry . " Calendar of the day , " called the Speaker , and as the Clerk placed a bill upon its final passage , Mr. Gerry walked out of the Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby generally , there might have been some merit in it , but to have singled out a man who , whether right or wrong , was interested in a measure that he believes to be in the interest of civilization and humanity , and for the protection of little children against beasts , while a notorious lobbyist , Gardner , was lobbying for a telephone bill that is known to carry a corruption fund , and another equally well-known political lobbyist , a Republican district leader in New-York , Leroy B. Crane , was lobbying at the same time on the Tobin Dressed-Stone bill , while the Assembly Chamber is swarming daily with political heelers and lobbyists of all kinds , shades , and cheapness , reflects but little credit upon the member who made the original suggestion , the Speaker , who acted upon it , or the House that approved it . When asked regarding the action of Mr. Bell and Speaker Fish , Commodore Gerry said : " This is the first personal discourtesy that I have received at the hands of the Legislature during my twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State . I have held offices twice under the State , first as a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1667 , and second as Chairman of the State Commission on Capital Punishment , appointed by act of the Legislature . Years ago a similar motion was made , when the late James W. Husted was leader on the floor of the Assembly , when the Speaker ruled that I was entitled to the privileges of the floor ' u.s a former State officer . " I was then advocating a bill in the interest of children . I never lobbied for any private measure , and at the time this motion was made to-day I was conversing with a personal friend about a matter not in any way connected with any legislation . My relations with the Speaker have always been of a friendly character . My . only regret is that the action of the Legislature will be gratifying to the enemies of the New-York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children , ' of which I am President , and of its sister sotieties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Mr. Gerry has ample opportunity to converse with the members outside of the chamber and in the committee room . We are sitting here as judges , and should not have our deliberations interrupted by lobbyists , no matter whether for a good or a bad measure . Mr. Gerry 's station should not entitle him to any more privileges than anybody else . Mr. Gerry was around here during the session yesterday . exhibiting disgusting pictures , which certainly should not be shown except before a select committee , and then only in private . He certainly would not be allowed to exhibit them in court . " The pictures which Mr. Bell referred to were some two dozen illustrations of the effects of certain crimes committed on children and were used by Mr. Gerry in his arguments in favor of the Whipping-Post bill , which he is endeavoring to have placed on the statute books , with a view to stopping this class of crime , which , Mr. Gerry says , Is increasing each year : The bill has paeeed the Senate and is now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerry is a noted philanthropist . Although a man of enormous wealth , Mr. Gerry has given up nearly all his time for many years - to caring for children and ' protecting them from abuse and cruel treatment . The State Commission on Capital Punishment is , it is claimed , still in existence . If this is so , Mr. Gerry was certainly entitled to the privileges of the floor .
