txt Old readers of The Tribune must have rubbed their eyes yesterday morning and wondered whether it was really The Tribune they were reading when they came upon the report of the remarks of its editor at toe Chamber of Commerce dinner the evening before . That the President of the United States , being also the sponsor of the " bill , " should have made a speech at the Export Exhibition , at Philadelphia , of all places in the world , without " viewing with apprehension and alarm " such an exposition of the ability of manufacturers of this country to compete on equal terms in the markets di the world was already startling enough to readers brought up on the protectionist milk with which The Tribune has for half a century been flowing . But then , there was the chance that the President did not quite appreciate what he was doing . It is to be feared that no such excuse is possible for the editor of The Tribune when he sings the praises of the open door . " Hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a European statesman once in a moment of unguarded candor , " you may as well mark that region off the commercial map of the world . It no longer exists . " No man ever said that of an English or a German or an American colony ; and it is to the interest of all three of us that no nation shall be able to mark the Farther East off the commercial map of the world . * . * * We have pledged the open door in the Philippines to Spain by a document which is now the supreme law of the land as well as the Constitution , and what we give to Spain we shall not refuse to the most favored nations . The Philippines then are , through our possession , added to the commercial map of the world , and I venture to think that in the century that is dawning they will fill a large space upon it . Does any one in tins company of great merchants ask what good our trade with them will be to us , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking what good our trade to Great Britain is to us ? It is open to everybody . Or our trade with Prance , or with Germany ? Does any one believe that , with the political control of the Pacific Ocean in our hands , we must still be such feeble competitors in Eastern markets that we can not command trade ? I have not thus rated the enterprise or the ability of nay countrymen . These are sentiments which it is the thoughtful patriot who reads The Tribune who will " view with apprehension and alarm . " What becomes of all the cherished watchwords with which that journal has been for half a century filling the minds of its pupils ? Have they not all had drummed into them , until it has become a fixed and seems to be an innate idea that the American consumer shall and should cheerfully pay more for what he needs than the foreigner , so as to preserve American labor from a competition which it can not sustain with " the pauper labor of Europe " ? If we can sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriot will reflect , much more can we sustain it here at home . If it be to rate meanly " the enterprise or the ability of my countrymen " to pretend that all they need in China and the Philippines is a fair field and no favor , much more is it to rate these qualities meanly to pretend that they can not compete successfully with the foreigner in the home market . We have no wish to make too much of the inconsistency of the former apostles of protection in coming over to the'position of the former apostles of free trade . The two positions are no doubt inconsistent , and nobody who occupies them both has made any effort to reconcile them . Far from us be it to suggest that the readers of The Tribune can not be revolted by the presentation to them of two irreconcilable and diametrically opposite doctrines , so long as both of them are labeled , by the same labeler , " good Republican doctrine . " It is simply the fact that Expansion and Protection do not go together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be demanding " the open door " of the foreigner who has obtained a " sphere of influence " in the Far East , the while we are slamming the door in his face here at home . The present tariff is the most violent slamming of the door in his face which we have yet executed . One can imagine the feelings of a French or a . German manufacturer upon learning that the nation which has passed an anti-revenue tariff expressly to prevent him from doing any business with it has yet had the face to ask his Government to open the " sphere of influence " it has acquired for his exclusive benefit to its own manufacturers and merchants on equal terms with him . His comments upon such an effort , which nevertheless our State Department actually gives out that it is making , would be apt not to be couched in diplomatic language . But the fact underlying all this confusion is nevertheless clear and gratifying . It is that the United States has outgrown protection and that that fact is recognized by the leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President was nominated upon the issue of protection , and tried his utmost to be elected upon it , until it was superseded by a much more surely winning issue , forced upon him by the insanity of the opposition . How the Republican pundits reconcile their irreconcilable positions is their business and not ours . They may say , if they choose , that Protection has had its perfect work , and that we are walking and running more swiftly now because for so long they kept us in swaddling clothes . The mundane fact is that the enterprise and ability of which Mr. REID thinks so highly had become impatient of the swaddling clothes . They would have become so if we had never had any war with Spain and never acquired the " American colonies , " of the free trade conditions , of which he speaks with so comical a pride . The manufacturers had already become restive under their protection before the war with Spain began . What was very much to the practical purpose , they had begun to show a marked indisposition to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuance or an increase of the protection which confined them to the " home market " they had outgrown . At present it is only the shipbuilders who continue to maintain that the only way to keep them going is by giving them pap in the form of subsidies . They even find advocates for that proposition , although they are protected by the absolute and formal exclusion of the competing product . As a consequence their manufacture languishes and lags far behind all other " manufactures of iron and steel . " It is they alone who can be relied upon for contributions to the success of old-fashioned high-tariff Re-publicanism Doubtless the Spanish war and the consequent expansion have done a very good turn for the politicians who perceived that there was nothing left for them or their party in continuing to advocate protection in a Nation which had come to perceive that its true interest lay in the direction of free trade . If they had been at all shamefaced about executing a right-about-face from the poll-. cies they had all along been advocating , the war would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them justice they do not seem to feel the need of pretexts or to be concerned to justify their consistency . Still , we may take leave to doubt whether it is tasteful for the editor of The Tribune to speak scornfully of those who do not believe that " the enterprise or the ability of my countrymen " can withstand a fair competition in the open market , seeing that his newspaper has been for half a century engaged in trying to propagate that disbelief .
