txt The editor of the Sun feels that his course in regard to the World 's spurious interview with Mr. CLEVELAND , which that journal repudiated on Sunday , needs some sort of justification , and he goes about the matter in this fashion : " After an investigation of our own as to the circumstances attending the interview , we are satisfied that the report printed in the World was inaccurate only so far as it failed to exhibit the language employed by Mr. CLEVELAND in the full measure of its violence . " Disregarding the improbability of the Sun 's having made any investigation of the kind , it is clear that if any such investigation were made , the only witness available would be the World reporter . But that person , as his own newspaper was forced to confess , is a news-forger and unworthy of belief . How does his testimony better the Sun 's case I At present the affair stands I thus : The Sun , lied about Mr. CLEVELAND : then the World lied about him ; thereupon the editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emitted half a column of extremely bad language ; next the World took back its lie ; and now the Sun. , abandoning its own original lie , insists that the World 's lie was the truth , and on that proposition appeals to the judgment of mankind ! This is a wide departure from the policy the editor of the Sun commonly pursued in his old wars with Judas . He had here a fine opportunity to show up the untrustworthiness of Judas 's sheet , of which the circulation so far surpasses his own . To keep insisting upon the accuracy of Judas , after Judas had abandoned his claim to accuracy , and to repeat falsehoods that had already been publicly exposed and retracted , with the certainty that Judas was upon his trail , is an achievement that has seemed to be beyond even the editor of the Sun , . Of course the interest of the question is purely psychological . Nobody cares what the Sun says about Mr. CLEVELAND , and nobody any longer takes the trouble to refute it . It need not and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For more true joy MARCELLIIS exiled feels Than ANANIAS with Judas at his heels . "
