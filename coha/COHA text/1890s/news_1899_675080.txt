txt Great anxiety about the situation in the Philippines is admitted at the War Department , and it is known to be shared by the White House , and in spite of the effort to put the nest face possible on the difficulties confronting Admiral Dewey and Gen. Otis , it is evident that the President and his advisers are deeply concerned about the outcome . Everything possible has been done by telegraph and otherwise to impress upon the United States authorities at Manila and at Iloilo the importance of avoiding the shedding of blood to enfo:ce obedience to the United States authorities . Were the inclinations and instructions of the Administration not interfered with , it is believed that it would be possible to convince the Filipinos of the peaceful purposes of the United States and of the inclination to assist the natives in obtaining a stable and autonomous Government . So persistent has been the resistance to the assumption of temporary control by the American forces that the War Department people are sure that influences have been exerted from Europe , and perhaps from Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the telegraph wires have been controlled by the military authorities in Manila , there is reason to believe that friends of Aguinaldo have given the impression that the United States forces have been cowed into holding off any attempt to exercise control , and that the Filipino Junta will keep on cultivating the idea that cowardice and not kindness is deterring the conquerors of Spain from pressing their demands at the point of the bayonet . Awkward as this state of things is , and difficult as it is to overcome , the success of the Filipinos in carrying on their campaign against the Spaniards has increased the belief in their ability to cope with their invaders and perhaps to set up and maintain some sort of Government when the time arrives for the natives to undertake civil administration . The President is represented to be hopeful of a friendly agreement with the Filipinos and he is unwilling to believe that the Filipino agents here are striving to effect a breach of the friendly relations heretofore existing between the natives of the Philippines and the troops . The difficulties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the task of communicating with the insurgents is daily becoming more discouraging .
