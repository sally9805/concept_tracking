txt P. M. ? After the departure this morning of the Puritan and other boats sent from the fleet to blockade Matanzas , Mariel , and Cardenas , the remainder of the fleet took up a regular formation , having drifted some fifteen miles from Morro Castle . The general advance was made at half speed . Capt . Evans , not quite certain of the position he was entitled to take with the Iowa , came up abreast of the flagship and shouted through the megaphone , " How near may I go ? " Rear Admiral Sampson , who was standing on the after bridge , replied , " As near as you can without drawing the fire of the batteries . " " All right . " Capt . Evans shouted back in tones that expressed the keenest disappointment . The Iowa then went ahead . About half an hour after the squadron was well under way the cruiser Cincinnati was seen on the eastern horizon , the smoke pouring from her funnels . She had been headed for Matanzas and evidently bad turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon made out , standing well in toward the coast . The flagship , the cruiser Marblehead , and the gunboat Wilmington immediately turned out of course to head the vessel off . The remainder of the squadron proceeded to the westward Smoke poured from our ships . The flagship was making eightten knots , the whole vessel throbbing with the vibrations of her twin screws . The little Wilmington steamed up in eplendfd shape and the fast cruiser Marblehead kept nearly abreast . The formidable trio bore down up-in the warship . Then a shout went up , " She is a Spaniard ! " For the next ten minutes the excitement was terrific . Tha distance which separated the vessels rendered it impossible to make out the warship 's identity . She was thought to be the Vizcaya or the Almirante Oquendo heading for Havana . The New York Prepares ' to PiAsht . The men at the guns shouted with glee . The stokers off duty below cheered vociferously , and begged to be allowed to go on deck to help shoot at the first armed enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck as elated as the mon , though under better control .

The life lines vanished from the deck . near ILLG Admiral Sampson , standing on the bridge ' said deliberately to Capt . Chadwick , " Yes , - the Oquendo or the Vizoaya , " and then added , " I should like to bag them both . " Then it was seen that the chase was flying an Italian flag , but this was no proof that behind her still invisible guns Spaniards were not concealed , ready to shoot , under advantage or subterfuge . All the guns on the New York 's port side and in the forward and after turrets were trained on the stranger . A. few - minutes later , when about 1,500 yards separated the New York from her target the American flag was run up by the warship , and then it was known she was not a Spaniard . A puff et smoke issued from her sides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only a salute , but at first many on board thought tear Admiral Sampson had been deceived ; The strange ! warship fired fifteen guns as a salute , which was returned by the flagship , which also flew an Italian flag . The stranger was then made out to be the Giovanni Bausan , a rather powerful cruiser . Without further formalities she pursued her course and en- ? tered Havana Harbor . Thus an exciting incident ended in disai pointment , but it served to show how anxious all hands are for a real fight and how splendid the discipline is when a contingency seems imminent . Capture of the Mathilde . Just as the salute was completed two schooners were sighted inshore from where the New York and the Italian lay , and the flagship signaled the Porter to go after them . The torpedo boat glided over the water at a very rapid rate and passed almost under the bows of the Bausan on her capture of the Mathilde .

But the Mathilde was more obstinate and probably did not appreciate being stopped by what looked like a toy boat , or else she failed to understand what the Porter wanted her to do . But when two more shots were fired from the torpedo boat the Mathilde came about , and the Porter ran alongside . informed her she was seized by the - United States , promptly took her prize in tow , and started off to the flagship with her . The Mathilde was loaded heavily with barrels of rum , and the Porter had considerable difficulty in dragging her through the water . But she finally brought her prize alongside the flagship , and by this time had hoist- ed the Stars and Stripes above the Spanit flag at the Matgellde 's masthead . Nearly the entire crew of the New York assembled on the deck , and as the Porter came up with her prize they gave her a great cheering . The Dauntless was about ready to leave for Key West , and Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , which was done , a prize crew from the New York being placed on board the Marthilde . The New York later in the afternoon rejoined the squadron , and a vigilant patrol was kept up at a distance of from six to ten miles of El Morro . The castle and the surn3unding fortifications could be plainly seen without glasses from the flagship while the capture of the schooner and the preparations for fight were in progress .
