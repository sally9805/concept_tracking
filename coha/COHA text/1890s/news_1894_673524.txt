txt Experiments were made at the point here this afternoon to prove that , with proper fulminate , the primers , or detonating fuses of the pneumatic dynamite gun can not fail of igniting the charge in the shells . The naphtha launch Sheila brought those interested in the tests from the Atlantic Highlands pier to the Government Dock . The Navy Department was represented by Lieut . Commander Seaton Schroeder of the Board of Inspection and Survey . Others of Capt . Tom H. Patterson 's passengers were R. T. Kingman , President of the Pneumatic Torpedo and Construction Company ; Engineers Capt . John J. Rapieff and B. C. Batcheller of the company , and Hudson Maxim , the maker of high explosives , and brother of the inventor , Hiram Maxim . At the " Hook , " an invitation to witness the experiments was sent to the Government officers , who were watching the tests at the butts with the eight-Inch guns and the disappearing carriage . Several came to the point , where are the three pneumatic guns , which alone have cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 15-inch muzzles , and of the new type with which the Nictheroy was equipped , to the consternation and moral demoralization of the Brazilian rebels . The other , an 8-inch gun Of the old type , was used for the experiments . The 15-inch guns are each 50 feet long . They will be tested next month . The 8-inch gun is 45 feet long . The charges for those of heavier bore will be from 50 to 500 pounds of Maxim nitro-gelatine . Near these guns is the power house , where the projecting energy is developed , and the projectiles filled with annihilating materials are kept in an isolated shed near by . The first care of the experimenters was to station an expert , with instruments of precision , on the wall of a fort east of the guns to accurately determine the range of the projectiles . It was then decided to fire three shots from the eight-inch pneumatic gun with different charges , and to use the Rapieff primer . This is an innocent-looking metal contrivance , which is screwed on to the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to speak . It is intended that the primer shall first strike the object selected for destruction , and the impact ignites the prim-1 ing charge and accomplishes the explosion in the projectile . After the Nictheroy sailed from New York , and the pneumatic dynamite gun on board was tested at Port Royal , it was found that , while the gun worked admirably , the detonators failed to act , so that they did not ignite the priming charge and explode the projectile . It was found that the fault was with the commercial fulminate that was used in the primers . Other fulminate was used to-day . The first shot according ' to arrangementi was entirely an experimental one to test the primer with a fulminate that had not deteriorated at a minimum of velocity . The charge Was twenty-seven pounds of wet gun cotton . It was placed , like the ones subsequently used , in an elongated cone of copper , at whose base was a steering gear like the screw of an ocean steamer . This is to prevent wobbling in flight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attached to the hoisting tackle , did not seem to excite anxiety among those who carried it . They , however , appeared to be interested when the projectile was hoisted to the ' breech of the gun and the " nose " was screwed on , and relieved when the mammoth cartridge was pushed into the barrel and tamped into place by a wooden pusher . Then the breech plates were closed , and , when the experts had taken up a position on a sand dune fifty yards away , and the workmen had retreated to the power house , Frank Creelman , who went with the Nictheroy to St. Thomas , mounted the carriage platform ready to turn the valve lever and admit the compressed air which was to launch the projectile in a line with the Oriental Hotel on Coney Island . He had to defer this for several minutes because of sailing craft and steam vessels that were near to or crossing the line of fire , but when there was no danger to anything within range the lever was turned . There came first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a sibillant shriek " from the projectile as it rose to make its parabolic curve before it fell , primer downward , near a red buoy more than a mile away . Eleven seconds were counted from the time the projectile left the muzzle of the gun to the moment when a flash marked contact with the water , and - the explosion of the gun cotton . . A. moment later a dense black cloud of water rose 250 feet in the air , and the experts said : " A conclusive success . " The technical report on this shot was : Elevation of gun , 18 degrees ; range , 1,800 yards ; wind south , five miles an hour ; charge , 27 pounds of cut guncotton ; detonator , a fulminite primer and two pounds and a half high-grade military guncotton ; initial air pressure , 1,000 pounds to the square inch ; loss , 13S pounds ; actual pressure , 862 pounds . The same conditions as to detonator , wind , elevation , range , and air pressllre were with the shot No. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The explosive is composed of nitroglycerine , 87 per cent. ; guncotton , 7 per cent. ; camphor , 4 per cent. , and other preservatives , 2 per cent . At this shot the projectile wobbled less in attaining full elevation than the first . It went down like a plummet , and impact with the water was instantly announced by the flash typical of nitro-glycerine compounds . In this case the column of water thrown up was fully 300 feet high . When the detonation came , it was sharp and crashing . Time , 11% seconds . Shot No. 3 was with the gun at an elevation of 30 ? . The charge was 103 pounds of nitro-gelatine . The range was 2,700 yards and the impact flash was vivid and the report made things rattle at the Hook . Water was driven up over 300 feet , and the column was twice as broad as those from the other projectiles . The time was fifteen seconds . The tests were pronounced entirely satisfactory , both as to establishing the trustworthiness of the Rapieff primer and the fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
