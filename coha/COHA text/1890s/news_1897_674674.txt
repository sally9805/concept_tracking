txt Some SOO leading Republicans of the . Twenty-fifth Assembly District , gathered in the hall at the " Chimney Corner , " Twenty-fifth Street and Sixth Avenue , last night . One of the most interesting statements that were made before them was that Which came from the lips of Assemblyman-elect Weekes to the effect that he had received a direct message from President expressing his earnest desire for harmony among the Republicans of this city . The meeting was that of the Republican organization of the district , which for the last two years has been opposed to the regular or so-called Platt organization . Its avowed object was the finding of a common ground of harmony for the Republican factions in the district with a view to a complete party reorganization . Both the regular and the independent Republican elements in the district were represented , and were heard . The speakers became warm , and their language was bitter at times , bait the bitterness was not of the ' kind that leaves a nasty taste . No one who Was there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all . Ex-Alderman John C. O'Connor presided . Among others present were John A. Weekes , Jr. , J. Augustus Johnson , Alderman Frederick A. Ware , Col. Charles N. Swift , Thomas W. Folsom , Frederick Gross , Major , Lovell H. Jerome , J. SteWart Davison , Robert B. Miller , Henry Birrell , Michael J. McCann , W. H. Morton , James G. ray , Henry J. Ruffner , Gilbert Ray Hawes , Robert Breckenridge , R. G. Bagley , Edward S. Flow , James B. Townsend , Col. Henry L , Swords , George D. Knight , Philip Crosson , Jacob H. Simms , William H. Simms , James Howard , William D. Carr , W. A. Mond , and W. R. Davis . The colored vote had a notable representation in the six persons last named above , and they put forward their sentiments with much force during the discussion of the question of reorganization . Some Essential Reforms . The Chairman emphasized the fact , though in very moderate words , that it had been " left for the Republican organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Republican Assemblyman , without whom this district would have been obliged to look to Tammany Hall for its sole representation . " He dwelt upon pure primaries and freedom of individual choice on the part of the voters as reforms essential to the reorganization and consolidation of the party . J. Augustus Johnson offered the following resolution : Resolved , That a committee of three be appointed by the Chair , to which the Chairman and Secretary shall be added , to con- sider the future of the organization , the best means of uniting the Republicans in the district , and with power to confer with other organizations . Mr. Hawes seconded the resolution in a vigorous speech . " If the Republican Party , " he said , ' is to keep a united front , it must go on with the work of progress and reform which this organization has begun . Surely , now is the appropriate time , and the only way Is to give to each voter a free and untrammeled choice . " He asked his hearers to " let the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as friends and brothers " to organize for future victorious struggles of the party . Chairman O'Connor put the resolution after a little further discussion , and it was adopted without a dissenting. voice . He subsequently named Walter R. Edmunds as the Chairman of the committee which it autnorized . Then he read a letter , which proved to be the warmest thing offered at the meeting . It was from Alderman-elect Sherman . Here are some extracts from it : " For my part I am very earnest in my belief that we should simply ignore the present organization controlled by Platt ; it is out of touch with popular sentiment , and in the last election did not control the majority of the Republican votes of the district ; it has , moreover , forfeited all claims to loyalty by the uninterrupted course of fraud , venality , and party treason which has characterized it for the last three years . Under the present County Committee and constitution , and with the present district leaders , any reform is impossible . " The County Committee can , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * With i such power in the hands of such a shameless body as the present County Committee the holding of primaries is simply a form to amuse the people and delude the fools . * * * I am , therefore , in favor of organizing outside of the machine . " Arguments Pro and Con . Col. Swift and Port Warden Miller spoke in condemnation of the uncompromising tone of the letter . W. R. Davis , the colored orator , made aai impassioned address in justification of it , and demanding for his race full recognition within the Republican Party , as entitled to the same rights and privileges as white men . Mr. Johnson advocated harmony on the basis of party reform . Major spoke on the other side , and was followed by Mr. Breakinridge in an address of great bitterness . " I came here to-night , " he said , " to be conciliated ; but I certainly do object to being conciliated with a club . I feel sore tonight that any class of Republicans should come here to exult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dregs of defeat . If you adopt the denunciatory expressions of your Alderman-elect you bar the door forever to a reconciliation and to the success of the Republican Party in the Twenty-fifth District . " " A. Political Assassination . " Mr. Breckinridge referred to the defeat'of CoL Patrick H. Murphy as " a political assassination , " and spoke of the son of the latter 's old General walking across his prostrate body and enjoying the feat . " I believe , " he added , " that the lesson taught the machine throughout the city will-be received in good part and its contents noted . But you must give and take . " Assemblyman-elect Weekes was introduced . and told of the message he had received from President , urging harmony in the party . Addresses were also made by Messrs . Townsend , McCann , Jacob H. Simms , Morton , and Assemblyman-elect Laimbeer of the Twenty-seventh  --  District . Roosevelt Brought Message Assemblyman John A. Weekes , asked about 's appeal for harmony , said the President 's message was brought by Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York to speak . at the dinner of the Society of Naval Architects . " Yes , " said Mr. Weekes , " I was told by Mr. Roosevelt that the President was desirous that there should be harmony . He believes that the independents should be recognized in the management of the party ; that there has been too much dictation in party affairs . " Senator Platt returned from Washington last night . He refused to discuss politics . Chairman Quigg will return to New York to-day . It is said that he will issue a statement outlining the future policy of the County Committee . ?
