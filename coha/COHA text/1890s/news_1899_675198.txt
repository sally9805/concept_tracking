txt Up to the close of business hours at the State Department to-day no word had come from London to indicate that the modus vivendi relative to the Alaskan boundary had been signed . It was said that the British and American sides had agreed upon the principles , as it was supposed , that should govern in the arrangement of the modus . This was based on a proposition emanating from the British side . This proposition was acceptable to the United States , but on some points it was so vague as to warrant the apprehension that it might contain within it the germs of disagreement in the not distant future .

The date of the commission 's reassembling is likely to be postponed until Autumn or early Winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
