Main text Footnote : 1Kb In the smoking-car of a suburban train on the Boston and Albany Railroad , in the Albany Depot at Boston . Mr. Edward Roberts is seated , deeply absorbed in a book which he is reading . He has a pile of newspapers and magazines beside him , and he rests an absent hand on them . The seat in front is opened toward him , and he keeps a foot against its edge with the effect of laying claim to it , while a Young Mother , with a child in her arms , enters hastily and looks distractedly about . There is no one else in the car , and after walking its length she returns and addresses herself anxiously to Mr. Roberts . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Is this the car for Newton Centre ? ROBERTS , starting wildly from his book : Newton Centre ? Why , I do n't know ; I presume so ; yes . Yes , I think so . I 'm going to Newton Centre myself . It is the car for Newton Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakeman said it was . ROBERTS : Oh , well , then , it must be . Why  --  THE YOUNG MOTHER : Because my husband 's coming to go with me and I did n't want to get into the wrong car . He had to run back to the store for some things . ( She approaches Roberts , and looks down at the seats before and beside him . ) But if you 're going there , it must be all right . Is this seat occupied ? ROBERTS : Well , not at present . I 'm expecting some friends , but  --  THE YOUNG MOTHER : Oh , well , all right , then . Should you mind if I put my baby down by you here a minute ? ROBERTS , reluctantly , but more absently than reluctantly : Why , no ; I suppose not . THE YOUNG MOTHER , with an air of explanation : You see , I 've got to go and get my bag . I had it sent over from the boat  --  we just got in this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat ; and it 's so heavy  --  I 'll have to hunt it up at the express office , any way  --  that it do n't seem as if I could manage both at the same time ; and I do n't know but what I 'll telegraph to my husband 's folks that we 've got here , too . I would n't ask to leave her with you , but there do n't seem to be anybody else I can ask , and I do n't believe she 'll make you any great trouble . May I ? ROBERTS : Why , yes ; of course  --  that is , certainly , if  --  THE YOUNG MOTHER : Oh , I do n't believe she 'll cry , and I sha n't be gone but a minute , any way . ( Roberts does not offer to remove the papers at his side , and the young mother , after smoothing the baby 's dress carefully under her , puts her down on top of them . ) Now , baby , do n't you cry . Mamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( She retreats a few steps , and flutters her hand at the baby . ) Goo , goo ! Smile a little ! Smile for the gentleman ! There ! She 'll be all right , and I 'll be right back . Do you know where the baggage-express office is ? ROBERTS , in a daze : It 's in the station , I think . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Right close to the place where the New York train stops ? ROBERTS : Yes , yes  --  I think so , I believe so  --  yes , it is . THE YOUNG MOTHER : That 's what the black man that calls the trains said ; but I thought I 'd better make sure , because there ai n't much time to lose . Do n't you topple over , baby ! ( She runs forward and saves the baby from falling against the side of the seat from the top of the magazines . ) There ! Mamma just caught you , did n't she ? ( To Roberts ) If you do n't mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of you , and then she 'll sit steadier . ( She lifts the baby , and flings Roberts 's papers upon the other seat , and then replaces the baby at his side . ) Now she 'll do nicely . I 'm so glad I happened to think of it before I went , for she might have fallen forward just as well as sideways ; and it  --  would you mind putting your hand round her a little mite so as to keep her up ? She is so wiggly ! ( Roberts glares stupidly up through his glasses and she takes hold of his arm and passes it round the baby . ) If you 'll excuse me ! There ! Now she will do . ( She moves backward to the door of the car again , waving her hand at the baby . ) By-by , precious ! Do n't you be afraid ! Mamma 'll be back as soon as she 's got her bag . Goo , goo ! Goo , goo ! ( She disappears through the door , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts ? ROBERTS , stupidly : What starts ? THE YOUNG MOTHER : Why , the car ? ROBERTS : Oh ! Oh , yes ! The train ! I do n't know . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Does it start at half past nine , exactly ? ROBERTS : I 'm sure , I do n't know . Yes , yes ! I believe it does . Yes , my friends were to take the 9:30 . THE YOUNG MOTHER , laughing : You seem to be pretty easy for a person that was to meet friends . I sh 'd been in a perfect fidge to know whether I 'd got the right train . ( Roberts makes no response to her remark , and a doubt rushes visibly into the young mother 's face . ) You 're sure it is the car for Newton Centre ? ROBERTS , with some spirit : I think I said that I was going to Newton Centre myself . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Yes , that 's what you said . But you might have got the wrong car . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is the one that goes at half past nine ? ROBERTS , looking mechanically at his watch : Yes , yes ! Half past nine ! THE YOUNG MOTHER : Good gracious ! Is it half past nine already ? Then there wo n't be time to  --  ROBERTS : No , no ! It is n't half past nine ; it 's only ten minutes past . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Well , that 's nice . And this is the half past nine train ? ROBERTS : Yes , that 's what I meant . THE YOUNG MOTHER , returning a few steps within : I questioned the black man that calls out the trains in the waiting-room pretty close up about it , and he said it was . But he might have made a mistake , because he has to keep so many on his mind . I asked him if he did n't , oftentimes ; but he says that 's just the reason he never does . I told him that I should go perfectly distracted ; and I cautioned him about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said there could n't be any mistake about it . Do you suppose there could ? ROBERTS : About what ? THE YOUNG MOTHER : About the train . ROBERTS : Oh , none whatever ; not the least in the world . It 's the train for Newton Centre I 'm quite certain . THE YOUNG MOTHER : The 9:30 ? ROBERTS : Yes , the 9:30 . THE YOUNG MOTHER : And what time did you say it was now ? ROBERTS : I 'm sure I do n't know . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Why , you just looked at your watch ! ROBERTS : Did I ? I thought you wanted to know what train it was . THE YOUNG MOTHER , after a moment 's doubt , in a burst of kindly perception and confidence : Well , I guess your friends better come ! But it 's like John , half the time , and I guess most men are just so , if the truth was known . It 's a comfort to feel that you can be trusted in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , please ? ROBERTS , looking at his watch again : Ten minutes after nine . THE YOUNG MOTHER , easily : Oh , well , then ! ( She returns and pulls the baby 's clothing straight over the toes of her small shoes , kisses her , hugs her , and kisses her again . ) There ! Now , I will go ! And if my husband should happen to come in while I 'm gone , will you tell him I 'm just out hunting for my bag ? ROBERTS : Yes , yes . I sha n't forget . THE YOUNG MOTHER , in a burst of good feeling : I guess I can trust you . I should like to tell your wife about your looking at your watch for the day of the week , if it 's her that 's coming to meet you , and have a real good laugh with her . ( She beams kindly though somewhat patronizingly upon Roberts , as she retreats once more toward the door . ) By-by , baby ! I 'll be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her to look after you . She laughs toward Roberts , as if this were a joke which he must enjoy with her , and vanishes through the door of the car just as Mr. Willis Campbell enters by the door at the other end . He walks down the car toward Roberts , approaching him from behind . CAMPBELL : Hello , Roberts ! What are you doing in the smoker ? ( He leans over Roberts to put various parcels into the rack , without observing the baby . ) You 'll be taking to drink next . ROBERTS , vaguely : Is this the smoker ? CAMPBELL : It 's going to be , as soon as I can light a cigar . But I do n't know what you 'll say to Agnes when she finds you here , wreathed in a cloud of tobacco . She 's coming with Amy , is n't she ? ROBERTS : Yes , I think she said so . CAMPBELL : Well , I 'll tell you what , Roberts : you think too much ; you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two women are coming down here to join us , and they 'll go flying about like a couple of distracted hens when they do n't find you . They 'll never think of looking for you here , and they do n't want me , and they 'll be in an awful flutter . ROBERTS , anxiously : Perhaps I 'd better go into another car . CAMPBELL : No ; this would be a good place to have it out with them . There wo n't be anybody else here , probably , and it will be quite like your own fireside . One of the few advantages of going home with you and Agnes , when you 've been in over night with us , is that you can have the smoker all to yourself in the morning . The commuters do n't begin going out till afternoon , and probably there wo n't be a soul at this hour to interrupt a family row . Still , I do n't know but it would be safest to divide up , and you go into another car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcels into the racks as he talks . ROBERTS : Yes ; I really think it would , but I do n't know what to do with this  --  He glances down at the baby . CAMPBELL , heaving a final bundle into the rack : There ! That 's done for . ( He turns about and follows Roberts 's glance . ) Hello ! What 's that ? Why , I was just going to sit on it ! Did you find it here ? ROBERTS : No , no ; it was left here  --  it was put in my charge  --  that is  --  CAMPBELL : Who left it ? ROBERTS , with spirit : Who left it ? Why , its mother , of course ! CAMPBELL : Its mother ? Where is she ? ROBERTS : I 'm sure I do n't know . She went out to get her bag at the express office , and she 'll be back directly . CAMPBELL , sitting down in the seat before Roberts and the baby , and confronting Roberts and the baby with a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ROBERTS : She went out just as you came in . She has n't been gone a moment . CAMPBELL : And she asked if she might leave the baby here with you while she was gone ? ROBERTS : Yes . CAMPBELL : And you said she might . ROBERTS : I could n't very well refuse . I let her leave it , of course . CAMPBELL : Of course . ( He relents so far as to make a silent inventory of the baby 's features and draperies . ) It 's rather a nice little thing . ROBERTS , with relief : Yes , and it 's been very good . CAMPBELL : Oh , it has n't had time to be bad yet , if its mother 's just gone out . ( After a moment ) Besides , it 's probably drugged . ROBERTS , in alarm : Drugged ? CAMPBELL : They usually drug them when they leave them that way . ROBERTS : What do you mean by " leave them that way " ? CAMPBELL : Oh , nothing . Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child : Going off ! Good heavens ! She was afraid I should let it fall . CAMPBELL : I do n't mean that . It 's going to sleep ; do n't you see ? It is drugged ! No wonder it 's so good . Well , I congratulate you , Roberts . ROBERTS , angrily : Congratulate me ? What do you mean , Willis ? CAMPBELL : I do n't know what Agnes will say to your taking such a responsibility without consulting her , but if you would do it , why I do n't believe you could have adopted a prettier child . ROBERTS : Adopted ! CAMPBELL : Do you mean to say you did n't know what you were about ? In this paragraphic age , when every other day you might read of young mothers getting unwary strangers to hold their babies a moment , and then walking off and never coming back , do you mean to tell me you did n't know what game that woman was playing ? Well , you ought to be left with somebody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all . He falls back against the seat , opens a newspaper , and makes a show of reading it . Roberts leans forward and desperately rends it from him . ROBERTS : Willis , do you suppose  --  do you think  --  CAMPBELL : Oh , I let you do the thinking . I simply know . I do n't go beyond that . I leave thinking to men of intellect . I 'm nothing but a businessman . ROBERTS : And what do you know ? CAMPBELL : Oh , nothing . Merely that you 're in for it ! ROBERTS , sternly : Do you mean that  --  that  --  poor creature has abandoned her child , and is n't coming back any more ? CAMPBELL : Well , not if you ask it in that threatening way , my dear fellow . I did n't put her up to it . ROBERTS : Well , it 's preposterous ! She could hardly tear herself from it . She came back again and again , to kiss it , and  --  CAMPBELL : Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last moment . I suppose I should do just so myself if I were a mother and meant to abandon my child . You could n't expect less of her . ROBERTS : But what possible motive could she have for abandoning her child ? Why should she do such a monstrous  --  CAMPBELL : Oh , well , there are various reasons . Perhaps her husband had abandoned her ; or she may have been a young widow with no means of supporting it . There are always good grounds for a mother 's deserting her infant when she does do it . What sort of a looking person was she ? ROBERTS : I do n't know . Very good-looking , I believe . CAMPBELL : Oh ! ROBERTS : And young  --  and nicely dressed  --  very respectable in appearance  --  CAMPBELL : Ah ! ROBERTS : And smiling , and  --  CAMPBELL : Of course ; she had to put that on , poor thing ! It would n't have done to let you see how heartbroken she really was . That would have roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a lady ? ROBERTS , thoughtfully : Not  --  not exactly : not in the society sense , that is . I should say she was a nice village person  --  the wife of a prosperous mechanic . She spoke of her husband 's " folks . " CAMPBELL : Precisely . Well , all you 've got to do now is to reconcile Agnes to the inevitable . She 'll come round in time , but of course  --  ROBERTS , with an effort for lightness : Oh , come now , Willis ; there 's enough of this . I do n't mind a joke , but there 's such a thing as carrying it too far . CAMPBELL : Ah , that 's what you ought to have said to the unnatural mother . ( He leans forward and looks closely at the infant . ) Do you suppose there 's any mark on its clothing , or any little note tucked in anywhere that would form a clew ? ROBERTS , faltering : I do n't know . I never thought  --  CAMPBELL : Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look  --  ROBERTS : But I ca n't . I am afraid that if I disturb her she may  --  CAMPBELL : Cry ? Very likely . But you must do something , you know . Could n't you pass your hand  --  I do n't believe you 'll wake her  --  softly over her , and if anything crackles like paper  --  ( Roberts acts upon this suggestion , so far as may be without risk to the child 's tranquillity . ) No ! All is silent . Well , then , the only thing is , should you know the mother again if you saw her ? ROBERTS : I do n't believe I should . Would you  --  would you go out and look for her ? CAMPBELL : But if you would n't know her when you saw her ? ROBERTS : That 's true ! But something must be done ! What would you do ? CAMPBELL : Why , if you do n't really want to keep the poor little thing , or if you do n't suppose Agnes  --  ROBERTS : No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ! He has got to his feet , and is standing over Campbell in great excitment , while Campbell remains calm . CAMPBELL : Then , I 'll tell you what you can do , and it 's the only thing you can do . You 'd better take the baby , and run through the crowd ; and perhaps , if the mother sees you ,  --  she 'll be hanging about remorsefully  --  she may relent and want it back . ROBERTS , catching up the child from the seat : Would you  --  would you  --  try leaving it with the brakeman , first ? He might have noticed what sort of looking person she was , and  --  CAMPBELL , tolerantly : Yes , you might try that . ( Roberts rushes from the car with the little one , while Campbell fastens his face to the car window , and expresses in vivid pantomime his pleasure in some spectacle without . He turns as Roberts renters the car , with the child in his arms . ) Well ? ROBERTS , breathlessly : He wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to look out for passengers ' children , and I 'd better find its mother , if I can ! CAMPBELL : The heartless ruffian ! But you see , now , do n't you ? ROBERTS : Yes , yes ! I see ! You 're probably right . But what would you do now ? CAMPBELL : I do n't see what 's left , except to do what the brakeman and I have advised . ROBERTS : And if I ca n't find her ? CAMPBELL : Then you 'll have to bring the baby back , and throw yourself on Agnes 's mercy . Or , hold on ! Yes , I think you might try that ; you might try leaving it at the package window . Very likely they 'd take charge of it there , if you checked it , and keep it till the mother called for it . But most probably you 'll find her , and when she sees that you are determined not to be put upon , perhaps  --  ROBERTS : And  --  and  --  you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby here with you , and run out and look for its mother myself ? CAMPBELL : I know it would n't . The whole moral effect upon her would be lost without the baby . Besides , how would you know her ? You must take the baby for the moral effect upon her . ROBERTS , with despairing conviction : That is true ! He rushes out again , and again Campbell attaches himself to the window , while from the other end of the car Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Campbell advance falteringly and doubtfully toward him , with many diffident looks to the right and left . They seem to decide simultaneously that the figure at the window is Campbell , for they start vividly forward . MRS . CAMPBELL : Willis ! MRS . ROBERTS : Where is Edward ? We 've been all through the train , and  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : We ca n't find him anywhere . We knew we should find you in the smoking-car , and so I brought Agnes right in . Have n't you seen him ? CAMPBELL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faces them hardily . MRS . CAMPBELL : Of course we have n't . Do you think we 'd ask if we had ? MRS . ROBERTS : What do you mean , Willis ? Has he been here ? CAMPBELL : Yes , I thought you must have met him . He has n't been gone a moment . He 's just gone out with the baby . MRS . ROBERTS : The baby ? What baby ? CAMPBELL : That 's just what Roberts is going to find out if he can . He 's looking for the mother . MRS . ROBERTS : Willis , dear , do n't tease ! What do you mean by the mother ? CAMPBELL : What does anybody mean by the mother ? The mother of the baby . Roberts is out looking for the mother who left the baby . Is n't that plain enough ? MRS . CAMPBELL , pouncingly : No , Willis , that is not enough ! And I want you to stop your teasing , and tell us what you mean by a mother leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Here . MRS . CAMPBELL : When ? CAMPBELL : About ten minutes ago . MRS . CAMPBELL : What for ? CAMPBELL : Ah , there you have me . MRS . CAMPBELL : Willis , if you do n't answer me , I shall make a scene and disgrace you before the whole car . I am not going to be trifled with any longer . CAMPBELL : I do n't blame you , Amy . I should n't like it myself . As long as there 's nobody but Agnes in the car I sha n't mind your making a scene , and as we 're likely to have the smoker to ourselves on a 9:30 train , why not sit down and wait here till Roberts gets back ? MRS . CAMPBELL , firmly : No , we shall not sit down , or anything , till you explain yourself . Now , do n't go on with that nonsense about the mother and the baby , because we wo n't stand it . CAMPBELL : Then what shall I go on with ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! CAMPBELL : Very well , then , all that I can say is that I found Roberts here , five minutes ago , in charge of a baby  --  or child of a year  --  which he said had been left with him by its mother , while she went out to look up her baggage at the express office . BOTH LADIES : Well ? CAMPBELL : Well , after a few moments ' conversation with me he took the child and went out to look up the mother . MRS . CAMPBELL : But why did he do that ? MRS . ROBERTS : Why did n't he simply wait till she came back ? CAMPBELL : Perhaps he thought she was n't coming back . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , nonsense , Willis ! CAMPBELL : Oh , very well ! MRS . CAMPBELL , visibly shaken : They really do it sometimes , Agnes . I 've read about it myself . But  --  MRS . ROBERTS : Well , they never do it in the world . It does n't stand to reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even suggest such a thing ! MRS . CAMPBELL , with conviction : Of course he would n't . And if this is one of his miserable jokes  --  CAMPBELL : Well , I do n't pretend to be a mother , but I hope I understand the feelings of a man , and I assure you that I would n't joke on such a subject . MRS . CAMPBELL : Then what are you joking about ? CAMPBELL : I am not joking at all . MRS . ROBERTS , visibly daunted : I ca n't believe the wretched creature would really do it . Why did n't you ask the brakeman if he had noticed where she went ? CAMPBELL : Well , that 's what Roberts did , and he wanted to leave the baby with him , but the brakeman said he had better find the mother himself  --  if he could . Roberts came back to report , and then he went out again . I suppose if he ca n't find her , you 'll have to keep it , Agnes . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello ! Here it comes , bringing Roberts with it ! ( Roberts enters the car flustered and dazed , with the signs of anxiety and disappointment filling his face , and drops of perspiration starting from his brow . ) Well , where was she ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Did you find her ? What did she say ? MRS . ROBERTS : Why did n't you leave the baby with her ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Why did n't she come back with you ? ROBERTS , frantically : Because I did n't find her . I 've been to the express office and everywhere . CAMPBELL , to Mrs. Roberts : You see ! MRS . ROBERTS : But you must find her , Edward ! CAMPBELL : Did you try leaving it at the package window ? ROBERTS : No ; I could n't quite bring myself to that . MRS . CAMPBELL : Of course you could n't ! And nobody but Willis could have the heart to suggest such an inhuman thing . The package window ! ( She drops on one knee before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and begins to study it . ) Poor little creature ! How good it is ; and it 's perfectly lovely , with those big blue eyes ; and it 's as clean as a pin . Why , it 's charming , and it is n't the least afraid . Just see it , Agnes ! CAMPBELL : Yes , Roberts said its mother had beautiful eyes and an attractive smile , and was nicely dressed . He seemed to have noticed everything about her . MRS . CAMPBELL , still considering the baby : You can see what a good mother she is . Of course she is n't rich , but it 's all the better cared for on that account . She has n't left it to any horrid shirk of a nurse . It 's as sweet as a little pink , is n't it , Agnes ? MRS . ROBERTS , leaning forward in some distraction : Oh , yes ; it shows the mother 's touch . Was she young , Edward ? ROBERTS : I do n't know  --  I think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should say . She kept coming back to take leave of it . CAMPBELL : I tell him that was the remorse working in her . MRS . CAMPBELL : Nonsense ! She never meant to leave it in the world . CAMPBELL : Then why does n't she come back ? It 's twenty minutes past nine , now . MRS . CAMPBELL : Very well , then ; something has happened to her ! MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , something must have happened to her . Why does n't someone go out and look for her ? It seems so terrible for us to be keeping her baby here and not knowing what has happened to her . CAMPBELL : But if nothing has happened  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Do n't hint such a thing . You know there has . You ought to go out and see ! CAMPBELL : I ? Roberts ought to go and see . I should n't know her if I found her . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , do go , Willis ! Poor Edward is all worn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme dejection and exhaustion , and he supports the baby on his knee with so lax a hand that it topples forward . The ladies scream , and Campbell catches it from him . CAMPBELL : Look what you 're about , Roberts ! You 're not fit to have an abandoned child left with you . Bless my soul , it 's off again ! THE LADIES : Off ? CAMPBELL : Yes , it 's going to sleep . MRS . CAMPBELL : So it is , poor little forsaken soul ! Let me take it . MRS . ROBERTS : The little darling ! ( As Mrs. Campbell possesses herself of the baby ) Be careful , Amy ! CAMPBELL : It was asleep when Roberts went out with it . Roberts thinks it 's drugged . ROBERTS : No , no , Willis , you suggested that . Though it is strange it sleeps so much . She said they were right off the boat , and perhaps they did n't sleep well during the night . MRS . CAMPBELL , pressing her face into the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ! CAMPBELL : And the mother may have fallen asleep in the express office with her bag in her arms . That would account for her not coming back . MRS . CAMPBELL , not minding him : If she does n't come back I shall keep it myself . CAMPBELL : Not if I know it , Mrs. Campbell . That baby is my property . MRS . ROBERTS : But if her mother left her with Edward  --  CAMPBELL : It was because I had n't come in yet . She 'd never have left her with Roberts if she 'd seen me . What shall we call her , Amy ? MRS . CAMPBELL : No , no ! We must n't think of it , till we 've left no stone unturned . You must go out and look for her , Willis , and if you do n't find her  --  CAMPBELL : But have n't I told you that I should n't know her if I saw her ? MRS . CAMPBELL : It does n't matter about your not knowing her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAMPBELL : Have the baby with me ? Ha , ha , ha ! I think I see myself running about with a baby in my arms asking people for its mother ! MRS . CAMPBELL : You made Edward do it . CAMPBELL : That was another thing . She left it with him . MRS . CAMPBELL : But you said she would have left it with you if she had seen you first , and now you must take it . She tries to push it into his arms . CAMPBELL : Oh , come , now ! You do n't want to make me ridiculous , Amy ! MRS . ROBERTS : You would n't really be ridiculous . I 'm sure that any one who saw you , and knew what you were doing to save a poor woman from despair , would praise you up to the skies for it . ROBERTS : I really think you could manage it better than I , Willis ; you are so ready , and you know how to take people so cleverly . Nobody would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't they ! MRS . CAMPBELL : And if they did , it ought n't to make the least difference to you . You ought to be glad of it . And , at any rate , you 've got to go . She makes him take the child from her . MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , Willis , you must ! Poor Edward is perfectly gone . CAMPBELL : Well , so am I. He suddenly drops the baby into Roberts 's lap , and makes a start toward the door . The two ladies fling themselves in his way with one cry of protest and despair . MRS . ROBERTS and MRS . CAMPBELL : Willis ! MRS . ROBERTS : You wo n't refuse such a little thing , Willis ! MRS . CAMPBELL : If he does , I will never speak to him again ! CAMPBELL : Oh , very well , then , if it comes to that ! Here , give her to me . He seizes the baby from Roberts and dashes from , the car , laughing . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could only appeal to his better nature . MRS . CAMPBELL : I hope it 's his better nature . But I did n't like his laughing . ROBERTS : That may have been merely nervous ; it made me nervous . But Willis manages these things so well ; he 's so full of resource . I feel quite sure he 'll find her . MRS . ROBERTS , pressing to the window and looking out : He 's disappeared already ! I should n't like to look for anyone in that crowded station . He is energetic . MRS . CAMPBELL , joining her : He knew that I was in earnest . But I do n't want to make him feel ridiculous . If I 'd thought he really cared  --  But something had to be done , and done instantly . Did they laugh at you , Mr. Roberts ? ROBERTS : Well , I ca n't say laugh , exactly . No , I do n't think I could say they laughed outright . But when I ran about , and asked if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby with a gentleman in the smoking-car , while she went out to look up her bag at the express office , they smiled . MRS . CAMPBELL : I suppose it did amuse them ; men are so peculiar . I hope I was n't too precipitate with poor Willis . But I knew that he could do something if he was forced to it . ROBERTS : Yes , he 'll come out of it all right , with his tact and invention . He 'll find her , easily enough . MRS . ROBERTS , in a transport of triumph : He has found her ! There he is , coining back , without the baby ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Where ? Oh , yes ; I see him ! I do believe he has found her ; and now I owe him any reparation that he chooses to ask . I 'll confess that I was wrong to send him . He is good , is n't he , Agnes ? MRS . ROBERTS : He 's beautiful ! And you are just the wife for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Willis is magnificent . I envy him his executive ability . ALL THREE , as Campbell enters the car , turning from the window : Well ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Where did you find her ? MRS . ROBERTS : What did she say ? ROBERTS : How did you know her ? CAMPBELL : Nowhere ; and nothing ; and I did n't . MRS . CAMPBELL : Then what did you do ? MRS . ROBERTS : Where is the baby ? ROBERTS : How did you get rid of it ? CAMPBELL : The way you ought to have done , my dear fellow . I left it with the matron  --  or whatever she is  --  of the ladies ' waiting  --  room . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh Willis ! MRS . CAMPBELL : And here we had been praising you so , and I was sorry that I had made you go ! Well , that is what I get for ever regretting that I treated you badly . ROBERTS : You think it will occur to the mother to inquire of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Or if , by one chance in a thousand , she wants her baby again , and makes a row for it after our train 's gone , the matron is the very first person she 'll be sent to . I thought it all out . In the other event , it will be handed over to the proper authorities and sent to the Derelict Infants ' Home  --  or something . At any rate , it 's off our hands . MRS . CAMPBELL : Indeed it is n't . If she does n't come for her baby , I 'm going to keep it myself . CAMPBELL : You ? Why you 're worse than Roberts . MRS . CAMPBELL : I do n't care who I 'm worse than . Agnes does n't want it , for she 's got children of her own , and so you may go straight and bring it back here . Do , Willis ! I 'm truly in earnest . If that poor thing should come here for her baby before you brought it back , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oh , I could trust you to think of something . MRS . CAMPBELL : Do n't tease , dearest , and do run ! MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , Willis , you must . It would be shocking to have her come for it , and we have to make some sort of lame explanation . Hurry as fast as you can . It must be nearly train time . ROBERTS , looking at his watch : Yes , it 's five minutes of it . But that 's plenty of time for Willis  --  if he does n't delay . CAMPBELL : Oh , hello ! Do n't you join in , Roberts . It was you who got us all into this trouble , and now I 'm going to let you go and get the baby from the matron yourself . There 's plenty of time for you , if you do n't stand here dilly-dallying . ROBERTS : But the matron would n't know me , and she would n't give it to me . CAMPBELL : I guess she 'll give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , then I 'll go for it myself . After this , do n't pretend that you have the least regard for me . Do n't try to stop me ! CAMPBELL , interposing himself between his wife and the door : Only over my prostrate form , Amy , I 'm going . Your reasoning has convinced me ; but you know that if we adopt this child I am not going to take care of it . MRS . CAMPBELL : No , no , Willis . I shall never ask you . I assume the whole responsibility . Oh , how sweet you are ! You always come round in the end . CAMPBELL : I always listen to reason , even when I 'm going to make a fool of myself . But suppose somebody 's got it away from the matron on false pretences , and I ca n't bring it ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Do n't come back without it ! CAMPBELL : Oh , very well . He rushes out . MRS . CAMPBELL , watching him through the window : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts ) Perhaps I 've been rash , Agnes . MRS . ROBERTS : No , not in the least , Amy . I should have been just so with Edward , and he would have hated it quite as much as Willis ; would n't you , Edward ? ROBERTS : Oh , quite . It would have been extremely disagreeable . MRS . CAMPBELL : Then I wish you had spoken before , Mr. Roberts . I did n't want to treat Willis worse than Agnes would have treated you . I am sure we have both , Willis and I , tried to consider you in the matter . ROBERTS : Of course . You certainly have , and I am very grateful for your kindness . But you know I did n't like to interfere , exactly . MRS . ROBERTS : Edward is always very careful in such matters . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , I am sure he meant well . But if Willis had been in his place and you in mine , I think Willis would have said something to stop me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I hope you do n't blame poor Edward , Amy , if you have been a little harsh with Willis . MRS . CAMPBELL : Then you think I have been harsh ! Well , I must say I did n't expect this of you , Agnes , when I was doing it all to relieve Edward of a difficulty . MRS . ROBERTS : You know I did n't mean to reproach you , Amy . ROBERTS : And we both thoroughly appreciate what you and Willis have done . I 'm sure I do n't know what would have become of me without your help  --  or his . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , I assume nothing for myself . ( She takes out her handkerchief and wipes her eyes with a swift dash , and then runs it back into her pocket . ) Do n't regard me , please ! But I wish the next time you think I am making Willis make a fool of himself , you would n't hesitate to say so . MRS . ROBERTS , glancing out of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAMPBELL , springing to the window beside her : Do n't tell me he is n't bringing the baby ! Yes , yes ! He 's got it . And now I forgive him everything . I 'm sure I do n't know what we shall do with it . MRS . ROBERTS : Why , I thought you wanted to adopt it , Amy . MRS . CAMPBELL : Not if it 's been the cause of my making Willis make a fool of himself . I should always detest the sight of it . ( She turns to encounter her husband , as he enters the car , red and perspiring , with the child in his arms . ) Had she come for it ? Did the matron give it up willingly ? Were you very ridiculous , Willis ? Did she laugh at you ? What did you say to her ? CAMPBELL , sinking breathless into the seat beside her : One thing at a time , my dear , and nothing till I 've got my wind . ( He pursues , panting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even on the part of the unnatural mother , and I dare say I was more a fool than I looked . MRS . ROBERTS , fondly and proudly : Oh , you could n't be , Willis , dear ! CAMPBELL : Thank you , Agnes , you are always so flattering . But the main point is that I got the baby back for you , and here it is , Amy , and the sooner you take it  --  Hello ! They all start into listening postures , while an excited and anxious woman 's voice makes itself heard from without in apparent parley with the brakeman on the platform . THE WOMAN 'S VOICE : Is this the half past nine o'clock train for Newton Centre ? THE BRAKEMAN 'S VOICE : Well , for that and about twenty other places . THE WOMAN 'S VOICE : The half past nine ? THE BRAKEMAN 'S VOICE : Yes , ma'am . THE WOMAN 'S VOICE : You 're sure it has n't gone ? THE BRAKEMAN 'S VOICE : Well , I wo n't be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , my gracious ! Which is the smoking-car ? THE BRAKEMAN 'S VOICE : This is . THE WOMAN 'S VOICE : And was there a lady , here , about half an hour ago , that came out and told you she had left her baby in the car with a strange gentleman , and asked you whether you thought it would be safe , and said she would be back in about a minute , and asked you to tell her just how soon the train started , and said she was going to get her bag at the express office , and asked you if you would look in now and then and see how the baby was getting along , and asked how she should know the car again , and you said it was the smoking-car , and she would know it by that , and  --  THE BRAKEMAN 'S VOICE : Yes , ma'am . THE WOMAN 'S VOICE : Goodness ! Then there ai n't a minute to lose ! CAMPBELL : The unnatural mother ! What are you going to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoptive child ? MRS . CAMPBELL : I shall know what to say . I hope you will . CAMPBELL : I hope Roberts will . THE YOUNG MOTHER , at the door , peering down the aisle till she catches sight of the baby , which Campbell has expeditiously transferred to Roberts 's knee , and then running toward the group : Oh , there were so many , I was afraid I never should get to the right one . But it is the car , and there you are , baby , as bright as a biscuit ! Did you think mamma had forgotten her precious ? Oh , you darling ! ( She catches the baby from Campbell , and crushes it to her breast and face ; and then turns to Roberts . ) I do n't know what you 'll think of my being gone so long , but I have had such a time ! First off , I thought I 'd telegraph to his folks that we 'd got here safe , but I could n't seem to find the right place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , a little ways  --  and then after I got it off , I went to the express office for my bag , and lo ! and behold it was n't there , and they said the baggage from the Bangor boat was n't in yet , and I thought I should go through the floor , and who should I see but John himself , just about as wild as I was , looking for me and baby ; and he 's gone back to look after my bag on the boat , and we 've concluded to stay till he gets it . He said he 'd been all through the cars looking for baby and me , and he could n't find us . " CAMPBELL : He probably did n't look into the smoking-car . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Well , there , I guess you 're right ; and I do n't know as I blame him any , for I did n't intend to get into it myself , and the gentleman here  --  ( she nods down at Roberts ) did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left baby with him , and  --  CAMPBELL : Oh , that 's just his way . He did n't know it himself . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Well , he did seem pretty absent-minded , so't I did n't feel exactly right about leaving baby with him , but I had to leave her with somebody , and  --  CAMPBELL : You could n't have chosen better . THE YOUNG MOTHER : I 'm sure I 'm ever so much obliged  --  CAMPBELL : Do n't mention it ; we 've all helped  --  my wife here , and my sister  --  and we 've all taken such a fancy to your baby  --  MRS . ROBERTS : Yes , indeed ! Such a good little thing ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Perfect little angel ! CAMPBELL : We almost hoped you would n't come back for it , and we were just quarreling about which family it belonged to when you came in . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Well , I guess when I tell John that he 'll be ashamed of the way he talked to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see by the gentleman 's looks that it would be all right , and so I told John . I hope he did n't think I was never coming back , by the way I stayed . CAMPBELL : Not for an instant ! He 's a brother-in-law of mine , and I took him in hand as soon as I came into the car , and we said we knew you 'd be right back , and if you did n't come before the train left we 'd get off . THE YOUNG MOTHER : Well , I wish you good morning ! And if any of you do ever come down Bangor way  --  THE BRAKEMAN 'S VOICE , without : All aboard ! THE YOUNG MOTHER , vanishing through the door : Oh , my good gracious , I shall get left , after all ! CAMPBELL , as the car starts : Well , Roberts lied us out of that pretty well , did n't he ? ( He puts his arm across Roberts 's shoulders . ) But he saved the mother 's feelings by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for your fibs , old fellow !
