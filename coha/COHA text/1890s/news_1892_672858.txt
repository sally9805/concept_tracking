txt The Chilean controversy interfered somewhat with the plans of the Adthinistration for negotiating for a coaling station in the West Indies . Now that there is no danger of trouble in the South Pacific , attention is again turned to the Island of St. Thomas , Sammie , Bay , and Mole St. Nicolas . St. Thomas is looked upon with the most favor by naval officers , but it is in the least likely to be obtained , for the reason that it would probably require the appropriation of at least 77,500,000 . This was the price agreed upon when Secretary Seward negotiated the purchase of the island from Denmark , twenty/lye years ago , and it is not likely that any less would be taken now . The island is just as valuable to the United States as when Charles Sumner pigeonholed the treaty of purchase in the Senate Committee or Foreign Affairs in 1868 , but there is much doubt as to whether the present economically disposed Congress would vote the necessary appropriation to carry through a similar treaty , should one be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western end of the Island of Haiti , would probably have been in the possession of the United States before now had Mr. Douglass been adroit in diplomatic affairs . This harbor and Samana Bay are both desirable , though probably not as desirable as the Island of St Thomas . Minister Durham . who succeeded Mr. Douglass , is understood to be negotiating for both those places , with the view to getting at least one of them . Admiral Gherardi had instructions to co-operate with him , and he will return to the Wrest Indies for that purpose as soon as he arrives at Montevideo , only stopping long enough to coal ship . Probably the only chance of getting Mole St. Nicolas is to wait for the next Haitian revolution , which can be counted upon to occur before long , and then make the cession of the Mole the price of recognition by the United States of one Aldo or the other . That is practically whet was done at the time of the last revolution , but Mr. Douglass let it get away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that Immediate possession will be taken by the United States . and no opportunity will be given for the Haitian Government to back out of its contract
