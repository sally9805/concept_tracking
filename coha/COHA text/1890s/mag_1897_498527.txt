THE next morning , May 7 , General Grant was almost the first one up . He seated himself at the camp-fire at dawn , and looked thoroughly refreshed after the sound sleep he had enjoyed . In fact , a night 's rest had greatly reinvigorated every one . A fog , Combined with the smoke from the smoldering forest fires , rendered it difficult for those of us who were sent to make reconnaissances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openings in the forest . A little after 6 A. M. there was some artillery firing from Warren 's batteries , which created an impression for a little while that the enemy might be moving against him ; but he soon sent word that he had been firing at some skirmishers who had pushed down to a point near his intrenchments and discharged a few shots . At 6:30 A. M. the general issued his orders to prepare for a night march of the entire army toward Spotsylvania Court House , on the direct road to Richmond . At 8:30 Burnside pushed out a skirmishing party to feel the enemy , and found that he had withdrawn from a portion of his line . Skirmishing continued along parts of Warren 's front till 11 A. M. In fact , each army was anxious to learn promptly the position and apparent intentions of the other , so as to be able to act intelligently in making the next move in the all-absorbing game . The enemy was found to be occupying a strongly intrenched line defended by artillery , an ( l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile . While sitting at the mess-table taking breakfast , I asked the general-in-chief : ( ( In all your battles up to this time , where do you think your presence upon the field was most useful in the accomplishing of results ? ) ) He replied : " Well . I do n't known ; then , after a VOL . LIII. - 4445. pause , ( ( perhaps at Shiloh. * I said : 4 think it was last night , when the attack was made on our right . ) ) He did not follow up the subject , for he always spoke with great reluctance about anything which was distinctly personal to himself . The only way in which we could ever draw him out , and induce him to talk about events in his military career , was to make some misstatement intentionally about an occurrence . His regard for truth was so great that his mind always rebelled against inaccuracies , and in his desire to correct the error he would go into an explanation of the facts , and in doing so would often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An officer related to the general an incident of the attack the night before , which showed that even the gravest events have a comical side . In the efforts to strengthen our right , a number of teamsters had been ordered into the ranks and sent hurriedly to the front . As they were marching past their tealns , one of the men was recognized by his favorite ( ( lead ) ) mule , who proceeded to pay his respects to him in a friendly hee-haw , which reverberated through the forest until the sound bid fair to rival the report of the opening gun at Lexington , which fired the ( ( shot heard round the world . ) ) The teamster turned to him and cried : ( ( Oh , you better not laugh , old Simon Bolivar . Before this fight s through I bet they 11 pick you up and put you into the ranks , too ! ) ) After leaving the breakfast-table , the general lighted a cigar and took his seat on camp-stool in front of his tent . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations of the day before . He expressed himself as satisfied with the result in the main , saying : " While it is in one sense a drawn battle , as neither side has gained or lost ground substantially since the fighting 345 // began , yet we remain in possession of the field , and the forces opposed to us have withdrawn to a distance from our front and taken up a defensive position . We can not call the engagement a positive victory , but the enemy have only twice actually reached our lines in their many attacks , and have not gaineda single advantage . This will enable me to carry out my intention of moving to the left , and compelling the enemy to fight in a more open country and outside of their breastworks. * An old officer who was passing by , an acquaintance of the general 's , now stepped up to the group . He had recently been ordered in from the plains , and his wild tales of redhanded slaughter in the land of the savages had already made him known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked to him , ( ( Well , as you ye been spoiling for a fight ever since you joined this army , how did yesterday 's set  --  to strike you by way of a skirmish ? ) ) ( ( Oh ! ) ) was the reply , **you had large numbers engaged , and heavy losses ; but it was n't the picturesque , desperate hand-tohand fighting that you see when you re among the Injuns . ) ) ( ( No ; but we got in some pretty neat work on the white man , ) ) said the aide . ( ( Yes ; but it did n't compare with the time the Nez Perc6s and the Shoshonee tribes had their big battle , ) ) continued the veteran . " Why , how was that ? ) ) cried all present in a chorus . " Well , you see , " explained the narrator , ( ( first the Nez Perc*s set up a yell louder than a blast of Gabriel 's trumpet , and charged straight across the valley ; but the Shoshonees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon they went for the Nez Perc6s and drove em back again . As soon as the Nez Perc6s could catch their breath they took another turn at the Shoshonees , and shoved them back just about where they started from . By this time the ground between em was so covered by the killed and wounded that you could n't see as much as a blade of grass . But still they kept on charging back and forth across that valley , and they moved so fast that when their lines of battle passed me , the wind they made was so strong that I had to hold my hat on with both hands , and once I came mighty near being blown clear off my feet . ) ) " Why , where were you all this time ? ) ) asked several voices . " Oh , " said he , " I was standing on a little knoll in the middle of the valley , looking on . ) ) ( ( Why , ) ) remarked an officer , " I should think they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the veteran of the plains assumed an air of offended innocence , and in a tone of voice which made it painfully evident that he felt the hurt , he said , ( ( What ? - the Injuns ! Lord , they all knew me ! ) ) The general joined in the smiles which followed this bit of sadly mutilated truth . Similar Munchausenisms , indulged in from time to time by this officer , demonstrated the fact that he had become so skilled in warping veracity that one of his lies could make truth look mean alongside of it , and he finally grew so untrustworthy that it was unsafe even to believe the contrary of what he said . At 3 m . M. despatches were received by way of Washington , saying that General Butler had reached the junction of the James and Appomattox rivers the night of the 5th , had surprised the enemy , and successfully disembarked his troops , and that Sherman was moving out against Johnston in Georgia , and expected that a battle would be fought on the 7th . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march had now been completed . The wagon-trains were to move at 4 P. M. , so as to get a start of the infantry , and then go into park and let the troops pass them . The cavalry had been thrown out in advance ; the infantry began the march at 8:30 P. M. Warren was to proceed along the Brock road toward Spotsyivania Court House , moving by the rear of Hancock , whose corps was to remain in itB position during the night to guard against a possible attack by the enemy , and afterward to follow Warren . Sedgwick was to move by way of Chancellorsville and Piney Branch Church . Burnside was to follow Sedgwick , and to cover the trains which moved on the roads that were farthest from the enemy . Soon after dark , Generals Grant and Meade , accompanied by their staffs , after having given personal supervision to the starting of the march , rode along the Brock road toward Hancock 's headquarters , with the intention of waiting there till Warren 's troops should reach that point . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected demonstration on the part of the troops , which created one of the most memorable scenes of the campaign . Notwithstanding the darkness of the night , the form of the commander was recognized , and word was passed rapidly along that the chief who had led them through the mazes of the Wilderness was again moving forward with his horse 's head turned toward Richmond . Troops know but little about what is going on in a large army , except the occurrences which take place in their immediate vicinity ; but this night ride // of the general-in-chief told plainly the story of success , and gave each man to understand that the cry was to he ( ( On to Richmond ! ) ) Soldiers weary and sleepy after their long battle , with stiffened limbs and smarting wounds , now sprang to their feet , forgetful of their pains , and rushed forward to the roadside . Wild cheers echoed through the forest , and glad shouts of triumph rent the air . Men swung their hats , tossed up their arms , and pressed forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and speaking to him with the familiarity of comrades . Pine-knots and leaves were set on fire , and lighted the scene with their weird , flickering glare . The night march had become a triumphal procession for the new commander . The demonstration was the emphatic verdict pronounced by the troops upon his first battle in the East . The excitement had been imparted to the horses , which soon became restive , and even the general 's large bay , over which he possessed ordinarily such perfect control , became difficult to manage . Instead of being elated by this significant ovation , the general , thoughtful only of the practical question of the success of the movement , said : ( ( This is most unfortunate . The sound will reach the ears of the enemy , and I fear it may reveal our movement . ) ) By his direction , staff officers rode forward and urged the men to keep quiet so as not to attract the enemy 's attention ; but the demonstration did not really cease until the general was out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , the party remained with him for some time , awaiting the arrival of the head of Warren 's troops . Hancock 's wound received at Gettysburg had not thoroughly healed , and he suffered such inconvenience from it when in the saddle that he had applied for permission to ride in a springambulance while on the march and when his troops were not in action . He was reclining upon one of the seats of the ambulance , conversing with General Grant , who had dismounted and was sitting on the ground with his back against a tree , whittling a stick , when the sound of firing broke forth directly in front . Hancock sprang up , seized his sword , which was lying near him , buckled it around his waist , and cried : ( ( My horse ! my horse ! * The scene was intensely dramatic , and recalled vividly to the bystanders the cry of Richard III on the field of Bosworth . Grant listened a moment without changing his position or ceasing his whittling , and then re marked : ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side . It takes two sides to start a fight . ) ) In a few minutes the firing died away , and it was found that the enemy was not advancing . The incident fairly illustrates the contrast in the temperaments of these two distinguished soldiers . A MIDNIGHT RIDE . AT 11 o'clock word came to Grant and Meade that their headquarters escorts and wagons were delaying the advance of Warren 's corps , and they decided to move on to Todd 's tavern in order to clear the way . The woods were still on fire along parts of the main road , which made it almost impassable , so that the party turned out to the right into a side road . The intention was to take the same route by which the cavalry had advanced , but it was difficult to tell one road from another . The night was dark , the dust was thick , the guide who was directing the party became confused , and it was uncertain whether we were going in the right direction or riding into the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treachery , but he was innocent of such a charge , and had only lost his bearings . Colonel Comstock rode on in advance , and hearing the sound of lnarching columns not far off on our right , came back with this news , and it was decided to return to the Brock road . General Grant at first demurred when it was proposed to turn back , and urged the guide to try and find some cross-road leading to the Brock road , to avoid retracing our steps . This was an instance of his marked aversion to turning back , which amounted almost to a superstition . He often put himself to the greatest personal inconvenience to avoid it . When he found he was not traveling in the direction he intended to take , he would try all sorts of cross-cuts , ford streams , and jump any number of fences to reach another road rather than go back and take a fresh start . If he had been in the place of the famous apprentice boy who wandered away from London , he would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Bow Bells would have appealed to deaf ears when they chimed out , ( ( Turn again , Whittington . ) ) The enemy who encountered hiln never failed to feel the effect of this inborn prejudice against turning back . However , a slight retrograde movement became absolutely necessary in the present instance , and the general yielded to the force of circumstances . An orderly was stationed at the fork of the roads to indicate the right direction to Warren 's troops when they should reach // that point , and our party proceeded to Todd 's tavern , reaching there soon after midnight . It was learned afterward that Anderson 's ( Longstreet 's ) corps had been marching paralleiwith us , and at a distance of less than a mile , so that the apprehension felt was well founded . GRANT ROUGHS IT WITH HIS TROOPS . THE general and staff bivouacked upon the ground . The night was quite chilly , and a couple of fires were lighted to add to our comfort . General Grant lay down with his officers beside one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide quietly spread an overcoat over him . For about four hours we all kept turning over every few minutes so as to get warmed on both sides , imitating with our bodies the diurnal motion of the earth as it exposes its sides alternately to the heat of the sun . When daylight broke it was seen that a low board structure close to which the general-in-chief had lain down was a pig-pen ; but its former occupants had disappeared , and were probably at that time nourishing the stomachs of the cavalry troopers of the invading army . Unfortunately , the odors of the place had not taken their departure with the pigs , but remained to add to the discomfort of the 1 ) ivouackers . Sheridan 's cavalry had had a fight at this place the afternoon before , in which he had defeated the opposing force , and the ground in the vicinity , strewn with the dead , offered ample evidence of the severity of the struggle . At daylight on the morning of the 8th active operations were in progress throughout the columns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads to seize the bridges crossing the Po River . General Meade modified these orders , and directed a portion of the cavalry to move in front of Warren 's infantry on the Spotsylvania Court House road . The enemy were felling trees and placing other obstacles in the way , in order to impede the movement , and the cavalry was afterward withdrawn and the infantry directed to open the way . About sunrise General Grant , after taking off his coat and shaking it to rid it of some of the dust in which he had lain down , shared with the staff-officers some soldiers ' rations , and then seated himself on the ground by the roadside to take his morning smoke . OUT OF THE WILDERNESS . SOON afterward he and General Meade rode on , and established their respective headquarters near Piney Branch Church , about two miles to the east of Todd 's tavern . It was Sunday , but the overrunning of the country by contending armies had scattered the little church 's congregation . The temple of prayer was voiceless , the tolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hostile guns , and in the excitement which prevailed it must be confessed that few recalled the fact that it was the Sabbath day . A drum corps in passing caught sight of the general , and at once struck up a then popular negro camp-meeting air . Every one began to laugh , and Rawlins cried , ( ( Good for the drummers ! ) ) ( ( What s the fun ? * inquired the general . ( ( Why , ) ) was the reply , ( ( they are playing , ( Ai n't I glad to get out ob de wilderness ! ) ) ) The general smiled at the ready wit of the musicians , and said , ( ( Well , with me a musical joke always requires explanation . I know only two tunes : one is ( Yankee Doodle , ) and the other is n't . ) ) Charles A. Dana , Assistant Secretary of War , joined us during the forenoon , coming from Washington by way of Rappahannock Station , and remained at headquarters most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hourly , despatches to the War Department , giving the events occurring in the field , constituted a correspondence which is a rare example of perspicuity , accuracy , and vividness of description . SHERIDAN ORDERED TO CRUSH ( ( JEB ) ) STUART . SHERIDAN had been sent for by Meade to come to his headquarters , and when he arrived , between eleven and twelve o'clock that morning , a very acrimonious dispute took place between the two generals . Meade was possessed of an excitable temper which under irritating circumstances became almost ungovernable . He had worked himself into a towering passion regarding the delays encountered in the forward Inovement , and when Sheridan appeared went at him hammer and tongs , accusing him of blunders , and charging him with not making a proper disposition of his troops , and letting the cavalry block the advance of the infantry . Sheridan was equally fiery , and , smarting under the belief that he was unjustly treated , all the hotspur in his nature was aroused . He insisted that Meade had created the trouble by countermanding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this act which had resulted in mixing up his troops with the infantry , exposing one cavalry division to great danger , and rendering ineffectual all his combinations // regarding the movements of the cavalrycorps . Sheridan declared with great warmth that he would not command the cavalry any longer under such conditions , and said if he could have matters his own way he would concentrate all the cavalry , move out in force against Stuart 's command , and whip it . His language throughout was highly spiced and conspicuously italicized with expletives . General Meade came over to General Grant 's tent immediately after , and related the interview to him . The excitement of the one was in singular contrast with the calmness of the other . When Meade repeated the remarks made by Sheridan , that he could move out with his cavalry and whip Stuart , General Grant quietly observed , ( ( Did Sheridan say that ? Well , he generally knows what he is talking about . Let him start right out and do it. * By one o'clock Sheridan had received his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning he started upon his famous raid to the vicinity of Richmond in rear of the enemy 's army , and made good his word . After the interview just mentioned , the general-in-chief talked for some time with officers of the staff about the results of the battle of the previous days . He said in this connection : ( ( All things in this world are relative . While we were engaged in the Wilderness I could not keep from thinking of the first fight I ever saw  --  the battle of Palo Alto . As I looked at the long line of battle , consisting of three thousand men , I felt that General Taylor had *such a fearful responsibility resting upon him that I wondered how he ever had the nerve to assume it ; and when , after the fight , the casualties were reported , and the losses ascertained to be nearly sixty in killed , wounded , and missing , the engagement assumed a magnitude in my eyes which was positively startling . When the news of the victory reached the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was largely instrumental in making General Taylor President of the United States . Now , such an affair would scarcely be deemed important enough to report to headquarters . ) ) He little thought at that moment that the battles then in progress would be chiefly instrumental in making the commander himself President of the United States . A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS . THE movements of the opposing armies now became one of the most instructive lessons in the art of modern warfare . They showed the closeness of the game played by the two great masters who commanded the contending forces , and illustrated how thoroughly those skilled fencers had carte and tierce at their fingers ' ends . They demonstrated , also , how far the features of a campaign may be affected by accidents and errors . In the Wilderness the mancnuvers had been largely a game of blindman's-buff ; they now became more like the play of pussy-wants-a-corner . Anderson had been ordered by Lee , on the evening of May 7 , to start for Spotsylvania Court House the next morning ; but Anderson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into camp , kept his troops in motion , continued his march all night , and reached Spotsylvania in the morning . The cavalry which Sheridan had placed at the bridges over the Po River might have greatly impeded Anderson 's march ; but owing to conflicting orders the movements of the cavalry had been changed , and Anderson occupied a position at Spotsylvania that morning as the result of a series of accidents . When Lee found our wagon-trains were moving in an easterly direction , he made up his mind that our army was retreating , and telegraphed on the 8th to his government at Richmond : ( ( The enemy has abandoned his position , and is moving toward Fredericksburg . ) ) He sent an order the same day to Early , then commanding Hill 's corps , saying : ( ( Move by Todd 's tavern along the Brock road as soon as your front is clear of the enemy . ) ) It will be seen that in this order he directed a corps to move by a road which was then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover this fact till he actually encountered Hancock 's troops at Todd 's tavern . Early was then compelled to take another road . It was after these movements that General Grant uttered the aphorism , ( ( Accident often decides the fate of battle . ) ) At 11:30 A. *I . General Grant sent a telegram to Halleck , saying : ( ( The best of feeling prevails . . . . Route to the James River not yet definitely marked OUt . ) ) In talking over the situation at headquarters , he said : ( ( It looks somewhat as if Lee intends to throw his army between us and Fredericksburg , in order to cut us off from our base of supplies . I would not be at all sorry to have such a move made , as in that case I would be in rear of Lee , and between him and Richmond. * GRANT IN FRONT OF SPOT5YLVANJA . THAT morning , May 8 , the troops under Warren encountered those of Anderson 's corps , who were intrenched near Spotsylvania . Warren // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and decided to strengthen his own position and wait until other troops came to his assistance before giving battle . His men had suffered great hardships . They had been under fire for four days , and had just made a long night march to reach their present position . Late in the afternoon Warren and Sedgwick were ordered to attack with all their forces , but it was nearly dark before the assault could be made , and then only half of Sedgwick 's command and but one of Warren 's divisions participated . There was no decided result from this day 's fighting . Late in the afternoon of the 8th headquarters were moved south about two miles , and camp was pitched in the angle formed by the intersection of the Brock road with the road running south from Piney Branch Churcb . Lee had by this time comprehended Grant 's intentions , and was making all haste to throw his troops between the Union army and Richmond , and take up a strong defensive position . Most of the officers of the staff had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designating the lines of march , and urging forward the troops ; and as soon as the tents were pitched that night all who could be spared for a while from duty ( ( turned in ) ) to catch as many winks of sleep as possible . Every one at headquarters was up at daylight the next morning , prepared for another active day 's work . Hancock was now on the right , Warren next , then Sedgwick ; Burnside was moving down to go into position on the extreme left . The general expressed his intention to devote the day principally to placing all the troops in position , reconnoitering the enemy 's line , and getting in readiness for a combined attack as soon as proper preparations for it could be made . The country was more open than the Wilderness , but it still presented obstacles of a most formidable nature . Four rivers run in a southeasterly direction . Some early pioneer , ingenious in systematic nomenclature , and who was evidently possessed of a due regard for ( ( helps to human memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most southerly , the Mat , the Ta , the Po , and the Ny , and then deployed these terms in single line , closed them in until they were given a touch of the elbow , and calledthe formation the Mattapony , the name by which the large river is known into which the four smaller ones flow . Spotsylvania Court House lies between the Po and the Ny . While these streams are not wide , their banks are steep in some places and lined by marshes in other . The country is undulating , and was at that time broken by alternations of cleared spaces and dense forests . In the woods there was a thick tangled undergrowth of hazel , dwarf pine , and scrub-oak . THE DEATH OF sEDGwIcK . A LITTLE before eight o'clock on the morning of May 9 , the general mounted his horse , and directed me and two other staff-officers to accompany him to make an examination of the lines in our immediate front . This day he rode a black pony called ( ( Jeff Davis ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi on the plantation of Joe Davis , a brother of the Confederate president ) . It was turned into the quartermaster 's department , from which it was purchased by the general on his Vicksburg campaign . He was not well at that time , being afflicted with boils , and he took a fancy to the pony because it had a remarkably easy pace , which enabled the general to make his long daily rides with much more comfort than when he used the horses he usually rode . ( ( Little Jeff * soon became a conspicuous figure in the Virginia campaign . We proceeded to Sedgwick 's command , and the general had a conference with him in regard to the part his corps was to take in the contemplated attack . Both officers remained mounted during the interview . The gallant commander of the famous Sixth Corps seemed particularly cheerful and hopeful that morning , and looked the picture of buoyant life and vigorous health . When his chief uttered some words of compliment upon his recent services , and spoke of the hardships he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expressedeveryconfidence in the ability of his troops to respond heroically to every demand made upon them . When the general-in-chief left him , Sedgwick started with his staff to move farther to the front . Our party had ridden but a short distance to the left when General Grant sent me back to Sedgwick to discuss with him further a matter which it was thought had not been sufficiently emphasized in their conversation . While I was following the road I had seen him take , I heard musketry-firing ahead , and soon saw the body of an officer being borne from the field . Such a sight was so common that ordinarily it would have attracted no attenti on , but my apprehensions were aroused by seeing several of General Sedgwick 's staff beside the body . As they came nearer I gave an inquiring look . Colonel Beaumont , of the staff , cast his eyes in the direction of the // body , then looked at me with an expression of profound sorrow , and slowly shook his head . His actions told the whole sad story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as he was approaching an exposed point of the line to examine the enemy 's position more closely , General McMahon , of his staff , reminded him that one or two officers had just been struck at that spot by sharp-shooters , and begged him not to advance farther . At this suggestion the general only smiled , and soon after had entirely forgotten the xvarning . Indifferent to every form of danger , such an appeal made but little impression upon him . His movements led him to the position against which he had been cautioned , and he had scarcely dismounted and reached the spot on foot when a bullet entered his left cheek just below the eye , and he fell dead . As his lifeless form was carried by , a smile still remained upon his lips . Sedgwick was essentially a soldier . He had never married ; the camp was his home , and the members of his staff were his family . He was always spoken of familiarly as ( ( Uncle John , * and the news of his death fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sorrow of a personal bereavement . I rode off at once to bear the sad intelligence to the general-in-chief . For a few moments he could scarcely realize it , and twice asked , ( ( Is he really dead ? ) ) The shock was severe , and he could ill conceal the depth of his grief . He said : ( ( His loss to this army is greater than the loss of a whole division of troops . ) ) General Wright was at once placed in command of the Sixth Corps . ARRIVAL OF DESPATcHES . AT daylight on May 9 Burnside had moved down the road from Fredericksburg , crossed the Ny , driven back a force of the enemy , and finally reached a position within less than two miles of Spotsylvania . By noon it was found that the Confederate army occupied an almost continuous line in front of Spotsylvania , in the form of a semicircle , with the convex side facing north . The demonstrations made by Lee , and the strengthening of his right , revived in General Grant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around our left , and interpose between us and Fredericksburg : and preparations were made in such case to attack Lee 's left , turn it , and throw the Union army between him and Richmond . At noon a package of despatches from * , *Tasl*ington reached headquarters , and were eagerly read . They announced that Sherman 's columns were moving successfully in northwestern Georgia , that Resaca was threatened , and that Joe Johnston was steadily retreating . A report from Butler , dated the 5th , stated that he had landed at City Point , and reports of the 6th and 7th announced that he had sent out reconnoitering parties on the Petersburg railroad , and had despatched troops to take possession of it ; that he had had some hard fighting , and was then intrenching , and wanted reinforcements . General Grant directed the reinforcements to be sent . Sigel reported that he had not yet met the enemy , and expected to move up the Shenandoah Valley and try to connect with Crook . General Grant did not express any particular gratification regarding these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact made very few comments upon them . ( ( I SHALL TAKE NO BACKWARD STEPS . ) ) HANCOCK had crossed the Po , and was now threatening Lee 's left . On the morning of the 10th Hancock found the enemy 's line strongly intrenched , and no general attack was made upon it . Lee had realized the danger threatened , and had hurried troops to his left to protect that flank . Grant , perceiving this , decided that Lee must have weakened other portions of his line , and at once determined to assault his center . At 9:30 A. M. the general-in-chief sat down in his tent at his little camp-table , and wrote with his own hand , as usual , a despatch to Halleck which began as follows : ( ( The enemy hold our front in very strong force , and evince a strong determination to interpose between us and Richmond to the last . I shall take no backward steps . . . * The last sentence , which I have italicized , attracted no notice at the time on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became historic and took a prominent place among the general 's famous sayings . It was now suggested to him that it would be more convenient to move our camp farther to the left , so as to be near the center , where the assault was to take place , and orders were given to establish it a little more than a mile to the southeast , near the Alsop house . The tents were pitched in a comfortable-looking little dell , on the edge of a deep wood , and near the principal roads of communication . COMMUNICATING WITH BURNSIDE . AT half-past ten on the morning of May 10 the general-in-cbief called me to where he // was standing in front of his tent , spoke in much detail of what he wanted Burnside to accomplish , and directed me to go to that officer , explain to him fully the situation and the wishes of the commander , and remain with him on the left during the rest of the day . As I was mounting the general added : ( ( I had started to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 11 finish it , and you can deliver it to him . ) ) He stepped into his tent , and returned in a few minutes and handed me the note . I set out at once at a gallop toward our left . There were two roads by which Burnside could be reached . One was a circuitous route some distance in rear of our lines ; the other was much shorter , but under the enemy 's fire for quite a distance . The latter was chosen on account of the time which would thereby be saved . When the exposed part of the road was reached , I adopted the method to which aides so often resorted when they had to take the chances of getting through with a message , and when those chances were not particularly promisingputting the horse on a run , and throwing the body down along his neck on the opposite side from the enemy . Although the bullets did considerable execution in clipping the limbs of the trees and stirring up the earth , they were considerate enough to skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I succeeded in reaching l3urnside rather ahead of schedule time . His headquarters had been established on the north side of the river Ny . I explained to him that a general attack was to be made in the afternoon on the enemy 's center by Warren 's and Hancock 's troops , and that he was to move forward for the purpose of reconnoitering Lee 's extreme right , and keeping him from detaching troops from his flanks to reinforce his center . If I3urnside could see a chance to attack , he was to do so with all vigor , and in a general way make the best coiiperative effort that was possible . A little while before , the heroic Stevenson , commander of his first division , had been struck by a sharp-shooter and killed . He had served with Burnside in the North Carolina expedition , and the general was much attached to him . He felt his loss keenly , and was profuse in his expressions of grief . The forward movement was ordered at once . Burnside was in great doubt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's right vigorously , or demonstrate with two divisions , and place the third in rear of Mott , who was on his right . I felt sure that General Grant would prefer the former , and urged it strenuously ; but Burnside was so anxious to have General Grant make a decision in the matter himself that he sent him a note at 2 : 15 P. M. He did not get an answer for nearly two hours . The general said in his reply that it was then too late to bring up the third division , and he thought that Burnside would be secure in attacking as he was . I had ridden with General Burnside to the front to watch the movement . The advance soon reached a point within a quarter of a mile of Spotsylvania , and completely turned the right of the enemy 's line ; but the country was so bewildering , and the enemy so completely concealed from view , that it was impossible at the time to knowthe exact relative positions of the contending forces . Toward dark Wilicox 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held pretty securely his advanced position . I had sent two bulletins to General Grant describing the situation on the left , but the orderly who carried one of the despatches never arrived , having probably been killed , and the other did not reach the general till quite late , as he was riding among the troops in front of the center of the line , and it was difficult to find him . I started for headquarters that evening , but owing to the intense darkness , the condition of the roads , and the difficulty of finding the way , did not arrive till long after midnight . GRANT ATTACKS THE ENEMY 'S CENTER . THE same day , May 10 , had witnessed important fighting on the right and center of our line . Hancock moved his troops back to the north side of the Po . Barlow 's division , while withdrawing , became isolated , and was twice assaulted , but each time repulsed the enemy . The losses on both sides were heavy . Wright had formed an assaulting force of twelve regiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. M. Wright , Warren , and Mott moved their commands forward , and a fierce struggle ensued . Warren was repulsed with severe loss , and Mott 's attack failed ; but Upton 's column swept through the enemy 's line , carrying everything before it , and capturing several guns and a number of prisoners . Unfortunately the troops ordered to his support were so slow in reaching him that he had to be withdrawn . The men had behaved so handsomely , however , and manifested such a desire to retake the position , that General Grant had additional troops brought up , and ordered another assault . Again a rush was made upon the enemy 's line , and again the same gallantry was shown . Many of our men // succeeded in getting over the earthworks , but could not secure a lodgment which could be held ; and as the assaults at other points were not made with the dash and spirit exhibited by Upton , his troops were withdrawn after nightfall to a position of greater security , in which they would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to abandon his captured guns , but he brought away all his prisoners . Upton had been severely wounded . General Grant had obtained permission of the government before starting from Washington to promote officers on the field for conspicuous acts of gallantry , and he now conferred upon Upton the wellmerited grade of brigadier-general . Colonel Samuel S. Carroll was also promoted to the rank of brigadier-general for gallantry displayed by him in this action . Lee had learned by this time that he must be on the lookout for an attack from Grant at any hour , day or night . He sent Ewell a message on the evening of the 10th , saying : ( It will be necessary for you to reestablish your whole line to-night . . . . Perhaps Grant will make a night attack , as it was a favorite amusement of his at Vicksburg. * Arhile the general-in-chief was out on the lines supervising the afternoon attack , he dismounted and sat down on a fallen tree to write a despatch . While thus engaged a shell exploded directly in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , without the slightest change of countenance , went on writing the message . Some of the Fifth Wisconsin wounded were being carried past him at the time , and Major E. R. Jones of that regiment said , and he mentions it in his interesting book of reminiscences published since , that one of his men made the remark : ( ( Ulysses do n't scare worth a HOW A FAMOUS MESSAGE WAS DESPATcHED . THE 11th of May gave promise of a little rest for everybody , as the commander expressed his intention to spend the day simply in reconnoitering for the purpose of learning more about the character and strength of the enemy 's intrenchments , and discovering the weakest points in his line , with a view to breaking through . He sat down at the messtable that morning , and made his entire breakfast off a cup of coffee and a small piece of beef cooked almost to a crisp ; for the cook had by this time learned that the nearer he came to burning up the beef the better the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table he conversed with Mr. Elihu 13 . Washburne , who had accompanied headquarters up to this time , and who was now about to return to Washington . After breakfast the general lighted a cigar , seated himself on a camp-chair in front of his tent , and was joined there by Mr. Washburne and several members of the staff . At half-past eight o'clock the cavalry escort which was to accompany the congressmanwas drawn up in the road near by , and all present rose to bid him good-by . Turning to the chief , he said : ( ( General , I shall go to see the President and the Secretary of War as soon as I reach Washington . I can imagine their anxiety to know what you think of the prospects of the campaign , and I know they would be greatly gratified if I could carry a message from you giving what encouragement you can as to the situation.o The general hesitated a moment , and then replied : ( ( We are certainly making fair progress , and all the fighting has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long one , and I am particularly anxious not to say anything just now that might hold out false hopes to the people * and then , after a pause , added , ( ( However , I will write a letter to Halleck , as I generally communicate through him , giving the general situation , and you can take it with you. * He stepped into his tent , sat down at his field-table , and , keeping his cigar in his mouth , wrote a despatch of about two hundred words . In the middle of the communication occurred the famous words , " Ipropose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer. * When the letter had been copied , he folded it and handed it to Mr. Washburne , who thanked him warmly , wished him a continuation of success , shook hands with him and with each of the members of the staff , and at once mounted his horse and rode off . The staff-officers read the retained copy of the despatch , but neither the general himself nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking sentence it contained until the New York papers reached camp a few days afterward with the words displayed in large headlines , and with conspicuous comments upon the force of the expression . It was learned afterward that the President was delighted to read this despatch giving such full information as to the situation , and that he had said a few days before , when asked by a member of congress what Grant was doing : ( ( Well , I ca n't tell much about it . You see , Grant has gone to the Wilderness , crawled in , drawn up the ladder and pulled in the hole after him , and I guess we 11 have to wait till he comes out before we know just what he s up to. * // NEWS FROM THE OTHER ARMIES . THE general was now awaiting news from Butler and Sheridan with some anxiety . While maturing his plans for striking Lee , he was at the same time keeping a close lookout to see that Lee was not detaching any troops with the purpose of crushing Butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 , the looked-for despatches arrived , and their contents caused no little excitement at headquarters . The general , after glancing over the reports hurriedly , stepped to the front of his tent , and read them aloud to the staff-officers , who had gathered about him , eager to learn the news from the co*iperating armies . Butler reported that he had a strongly intrenched position at Bermuda Hundred , in the angle formed by the James and Appomattox rivers ; that he had cut the railroad , leaving Beauregard 's troops south of the break , and had completely whipped Hill 's force . Sheridan sent word that he had torn up ten miles of the Virginia Central Railroad between Lee 's army and Richmond , and had destroyed a large quantity of medical supplies and a million and a half of rations . The general-in-chief expressed himself as particularly pleased with the destruction of the railroad in rear of Lee , as it would increase the difficulty of moving troops suddenly between Richmond and Spotsylvania for the purpose of reinforcing either of those points . As usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generals Meade and Burnside . PREPARING TO ATTACK THE ( ( ANGLE . ) ) THE result of the day 's work on our front was to discover more definitely the character of the salient in Lee 's defenses on the right of his center . It was in the shape of a V with a flattened apex . The ground in front sloped down toward our position , and was in most places thickly wooded . There was a clearing , however , about four hundred yards in width immediately in front of the apex . Several of the staff-officers were on that part of the field a great portion of the day . At three o'clock in the afternoon the general had thoroughly matured his plans , and sent instructions to Meade directing him to move Hancock with all possible secrecy under cover of night to the left of Wright , and to make a vigorous assault on the ( ( angle ) ) at dawn the next morning . Warren and Wright were ordered to hold their corps as close to the enemy as possible , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push in if an opportunity should present itself . A personal conference was held with the three corps commanders , and every effort made to have a perfect understanding on their part as to exactly what was required in this important movement . Colonels Comstock and Babcock were directed to go to Burnside that afternoon , and to remain with him during the movements of the next day , in which he was to attack simultaneously with Hancock . The other members of the staff were sent to keep in communication with the different portions of Hancock 's line . The threatening sky was not propitious for the movement , but in this entertainment there was to be ( ( no postponement on account of the weather , ) ) and the preparations went on regardless of the lowering clouds and falling rain . All those who were in the secret anticipated a memorable field-day on the morrow . Hancock 's troops made a difficult night march , groping their way through the gloom of the forests , their clothing drenched with rain , and their feet ankle-deep in Virginia mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formed for the attack at a distance of about twelve hundred yards from the enemy 's intrenchments . I had been out all night looking after the movements of the troops which were to form the assaulting columns . After they had all been placed in position I started for headquarters , in obedience to instructions , to report the situation to the general-in-chief . He counted upon important results from the movement , although he appreciated fully the difficulties to be encountered , and was naturally anxious about the dispositions which were being made for the attack . The condition of the country was such that a horseman could make but slow progress in moving from one point of the field to another . The rain was falling in torrents , the ground was marshy , the roads were narrow , and the movements of the infantry and artillery had churned up the mud until the country was almost impassable . In the pitchy darkness one 's horse constantly ran against trees , was shoved off the road by guns or wagons , and had to squeeze through lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flanders ) ) when a staffofficer 's horse manifested a disposition to crawl over them . By feeling the way for some hours I reached headquarters about daylight the next morning , May 12 . AN EVENTFUL MORNING AT HEADQUARTERS . WHEN I arrived the general was up and sitting wrapped in his overcoat close to a camp-fire which was struggling heroically // to sustain its life against the assaults of wind and rain . It had been decided to move headquarters a little nearer to the center of the lines , and most of the camp equipage had been packed up ready to start . The general seemed in excellent spirits , and was even inclined to be jocose . lIe said to me : ( ( We have just had our coffee , and you will find some left for you ) ) ; and then , taking a critical look at my drenched and bespattered clothes and famished appearance , added , ( ( But perhaps you are not hungry . ) ) To disabuse the chief 's mind on this score , I sent for a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shipwrecked mariner , while I related the incidents of the embarrassments encountered in Hancock 's movement , and the position he had taken up . Before I had quite finished making my report the stillness was suddenly broken by artillery firing , which came from the direction of Burnside 's position . A few minutes after came the sound of cheers and the rattle of musketry from Hancock 's front , telling that the main assault upon the " angle ) ) had begun . No one could see a hundred yards from our position on account of the dense woods , and reports from the front were eagerly awaited . It was nearly an hour before anything definite was received , but at 5 : : 30 an officer came galloping through the woods with a report from Hancock saying he had captured the first line of the enemy 's works . This officer was closely followed by another , who reported that many prisoners had been taken . Fifteen minutes later came the announcement that Hancock had captured two general officers . General Grant sent Burnside this news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ) Wright 's corps was now ordered to attack on the right of Hancock . Before six o'clock a message from Hancock 's headquarters reported the capture of two thousand prisoners , and a quarter of an hour later Burnside sent word that he had driven the enemy back two miles and a half in his front . Hancock called for reinforcements , but Grant had anticipated him and had already ordered troops to his support . The scene at headquarters was now exciting in the extreme . As aides galloped up one after the other in quick succession with stirring bulletins , all bearing the glad tidings of overwhelming success , the group of staff-officers standing about the camp-fire interrupted their active work of receiving , receipting for , and answering despatches by shouts and cheers which made the forest ring . General Grant sat unmoved upon his camp-chair , giving his constant thoughts to devising methods for making the victory complete . At times the smoke from the struggling camp-fire would for a moment blind him , and occasionally a gust of wind would blow the cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice in the middle of a sentence . Only once during the scene he rose from his seat and paced up and down for about ten minutes . He made very few comments upon the stirring events which were crowding so closely upon one another until the reports came in regarding the prisoners . When the large numbers captured were announced , he said , with the first trace of animation he had shown , " That s the kind of news I like to hear . I had hoped that a bold dash at daylight would secure a large number of prisoners . Hancock is doing well . ) ) This remark was eminently characteristic of the Union commander . His extreme fondness for taking prisoners was manifested in every battle he fought . When word was brought to him of a success on any part of the line , his first and most eager question was always , ( ( Have any prisoners been taken ? ) ) The love for capturing prisoners amounted to a passion with him . It did not seem to arise from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , and was no doubt chiefly due to his tenderness of heart , which prompted him to feel that it was always more humane to reduce the enemy 's strength by captures than by slaughter . His desire in this respect was amply gratified , for during the war it fell to his lot to capture a larger number of prisoners than any general of modern times . TWO DISTINGUISHED PRISONERS . MEADE had come over to Grant 's headquarters early , and while they were engaged in discussing the situation , about 6:80 A. M. , a horseman rode up wearing the uniform of a Confederate general . Halting near the camp-fire , he dismounted and walked forward , saluting the group of Union officers as he approached . His clothing was covered with mud , and a hole had been torn in the crown of his felt hat , through which a tuft of hair protruded , looking like a Sioux chief 's warlock . Meade looked at him attentively for a moment , and then stepped up to him , grasped him cordially by the hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , general ? ) ) and then turned to the general-in-chief and said , " General Grant , this is General Johnson-Edward Johnson. * General Grant shook hands warmly with the distinguished prisoner , and exclaimed , " HOW do you do ? It is a long time since we last // met . ) ) ( ( Yes , ) ) replied Johnson ; ( ( it is a great many years , and I had not expected to meet you under such circumstances . ) ) ( ( It is one of the many sad fortunes of war , * answered General Grant , who offered the captured officer a cigar , and then picked up a camp-chair , placed it with his own hands near the fire , and added , ( ( Be seated , and we will do all in our power to make you as comfortable as possible . ) ) Johnson sat down , and said in a voice and with a manner which showed that he was deeply touched by these manifestations of courtesy , ( ( Thank you , general , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in the corps of cadets with General Meade , and had served in the Mexican war with General Grant , but they probably would not have recognized him if they had not already heard that he had been made a prisoner . I had known Johnson very well , and it was only four years since I had seen him . We recognized each other at once , and I extended a cordial greeting to him , and presented the members of our staff . He was soon quite at his ease , and bore himself under the trying circumstances in a manner which commanded the respect of every one present . General Hancock had already provided him with a horse to make his trip to the rear with the rest of the prisoners as comfortably as possible . After some pleasant conversation with Grant and Meade about old times and the strange chances of war , he bade us good-by , and started under escort for our base of supplies . General George H. Steuart was also captured , but was not sent in to general headquarters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unseemly exhibition of temper on his part . Hancock had known him in the old army , and in his usual frank way went up to him , greeted him kindly , and offered his hand . Steuart drew back , rejected the offer , and said rather haughtily , ( ( Under the present circumstances , I must decline to take your hand . ) ) Hancock , who was somewhat nettled by this remark , replied , ( ( Under any other circumstances , general , I should not have offered it . ) ) No further attempt was made to extend any courtesies to his prisoner , who was left to make his way to the rear on foot with the others who had been captured . While Generals Grant and Meade were talking with General Johnson by the campfire , a despatch came in from Hancock , saying , " I have finished up Johnson , and am now going into Early . ) ) General Grant passed this despatch around , but did not read it aloud , as usual , out of consideration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hancock had taken three thousand prisoners ; then another that lie had turned his captured guns upon the enemy and made a whole division prisoners , including the famous Stonewall Brigade . Burnside now reported that his right had lost its connection with Han*ock 's corps . General Grant sent him a brief , characteristic note in reply , saying , qPush the enemy with all your might ; that s the way to connect . ) ) The general-in-chief showed again upon that eventful morning the value he placed upon minutes . Aides were kept riding at a full run carrying messages , and the terseness , vigor and intensity manifested in every line of his field orders were enough to spur the most sluggish to prompt action . HOW THE ( ( ANGLE ) ) WAS CAPTURED . AFTER giving such instructions as would provide for the present emergencies , the general ordered the pony ( ( Jeff Davis ) ) to be saddled , and started for the front . He left an adjutant-general behind , with orders to forward to him promptly all communications . The staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearing on a piece of elevated ground from which a view of portions of the line could be obtained . It was found , upon learning the details of the assault upon the ( ( angle , ) ) that , notwithstanding the fatigues and hardships to which the troops had been subjected , they had moved forward with the step of veterans , and had marched half-way across the open ground which separated them from the well-defended earthworks in their front with a steady pace and unbroken alinement . At that point they sent up cheers which rent the air , and the columns dashed forward at a run , scattering the enemy 's pickets before them in their swift advance . A brisk fire was opened by the Confederate line from a position to the left , but , unheeding it , and without firing a shot , the assaulting column tore away the slashed timber and other obstacles in its path , and rushed like a mighty torrent over the intrenchments . A desperate hand-to-hand encounter now followed , in which men fought like demons , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to load and fire . The main assault fell on Johnson 's division of Lee 's army . Lee was led to believe that there was an intention to attack his left , and he had sent most of Johnson 's artillery to strengthen that flank . Johnson had his suspicions aroused during the night that there were preparations under way for attacking // his front , and had induced Lee to order the artillery back . Bya strange coincidence , it arrived just asJohnson 's linewas carried , and before the guns could fire a shot they fell into Hancock 's hands . Besides capturing Generals Steuart and Johnson , he took nearly four thousand prisoners , thirty pieces of artillery , several thousand stands of small arms , and about thirtycolors . His troops swept on half a mile , driving the enemy before them in confusion , and did not pause till they encountered a second line of intrenchments . The enemy was now driven to desperation , and every effort was bent toward retaking his lost works . Reinforcements were rushed forward by Lee as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( angle ) ) ; and a formidable counter-movement was rapidly organized against Hancock , As our troops were upon unknown territory , and as their formations had been thrown into considerable confusion by the rapidity of their movements , theywithdrew slowly before the attack to the main line of works they had captured , and turning them against the enemy , held them successfully during all the terrific struggle that followed . By six o'clock A. M. Wright was on that portion of the field , and his men were placed on the right of the ( ( angle . ) ) Scarcely had he taken up this position when the Confederates made a determined and savage attack upon him ; but despite their well-directed efforts they failed to recapture the line . Wright was wounded early in the fight , but refused to leave the field . Hancock had placed some artillery upon high ground , and his guns fired over the heads of our troops and did much execution in the ranks of the enemy . Warren had been directed to make an attack before eight o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center in an effort to retake the " angle , * but he was slow in carrying out the order . Although the instructions were of the most positive and urgent character , he did not accomplish the work expected of him . A little before eleven o'clock General Grant became so anxious that he directed General Meade to relieve Warren if he did not attack promptly , and to put General Ilumphreys in command of his corps . General Meade concurred in this course , and said that he would have relieved Warren without an order to that effect if there had been any further delay . General Grant said to one or two of us who were near him : *I feel sorry to be obliged to send such an order in regard to Warren . He is an officer for whom I had conceived a very high regard . His quickness of perception , personal gallantry , and soldierly bearing pleased me , and a few days ago I should have been inclined to place him in command of the Army of the Potomac in case Meade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his want of vigor in assaulting on the 8th , that he was not as efficient as I had believed , and his delay in attacking and the feeble character of his assaults to-day confirm me in my apprehensions . ) ) This was said in a kindly spirit , but with an air of serious disappointment . Longstreet 's troops had continued to confront Warren , knowing that to lose that part of the enemy 's line would expose the troops at the ( ( angle ) ) to a flank attack , and the obstacles to a successful assault were really veryformidable . Warren was blamed not so much for not carrying the line in his front as for delays in making the attack . The general now started for another part of the field , and kept moving from point to point to get a close view of the fighting on different parts of the line . Once or twice he called for a powerful field-glass belonging to Badeau . This was rather unusual , for the general never carried a glass himself , and seldom used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his natural vision in examining the field . Badeau 's nearsightedness made him very dependent on his glass . A few days before , while he was using it , a battery commander who was passing attempted a professional joke by remarking , *I say , Badeau ; can you see Richmond ? ) ) ( ( Not quite , ) ) answered the colonel ; ( ( though I hope to some day . ) ) ( ( Better have the barrels of your glass rifled so that it will carry farther , ) ) suggested the artillerist . Before riding far the general came to a humble-looking farm-house , which was within range of the enemy 's guns , and surrounded by wounded men , sullen-looking prisoners , and terror-stricken stragglers . The fences were broken , thegroundwas furrowed byshells ; and the place presented a scene which depicted war in its most repulsive aspect . An old lady and her daughter were standing on the porch . When the mother was told that the officer passing was the general-in-chief , she ran toward him , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and cried , ( ( Thank God ! thank God ! I again behold the glorious flag of the Union , that I have not laid eyes on for three long , terrible years . Thank the Lord that I have at last seen the commander of theUnion armies ! lam proud to saythat my husband and my son went from here to serve in those armies , but I have been cut off from all communication , and can get no tidings of them . Oh , you do n't know , sir , what // a loyal woman suffers in this land ; but the coming of the Union troops makes me feel that deliverance is at last at hand , and that the gates have been opened for my escape from this hell . ) ) The general was so touched by this impassioned speech , and felt so firmly convinced that the woman was telling the truth , that he dismounted and went into the yard , and sat for a little time on the porch , to learn the details of her story , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She gave an account of her persecutions and sufferings which would have moved the sternest heart . The general , finding that she was without food , ordered a supply of ratiohs to be issued to her and her daughter , and promised to have inquiries set on foot to ascertain the whereabouts of her husband and son . She was profuse in her expressions of gratitude for these acts of kindness . Her storywas afterward found to be true in every particular . SCENES AT THE ( ( BLOODY ANGLE . ) ) I HAD been anxious to participate in the scenes occurring at the ( ( angle , ) ) and now got permission to go there and look after some new movements which had been ordered . Lee made five assaults , in all , that day , in a series of desperate and even reckless attempts to retake his main line of earthworks ; but each time his men were hurled back defeated , and he had to content himself in the end with throwing up a new line farther in his rear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most desperate engagement in the history of modern warfare , and presented features which were absolutely appalling . It was chiefly a savage hand-to-hand fight across the breastworks . Rank after rank was riddled by shot and shell and bayonet-thrusts , and finally sank , a mass of torn and mutilated corpses ; then fresh troops rushed madly forward to replace the dead , and so the murderous work went on . Guns were run up close to the parapet , and double charges of canister played their part in the bloody work . The fence-rails and logs in the breastworks were shattered into splinters , and trees over a foot and a half in diameter were cut completely in two by the incessant musketry fire . A section of the trunk of a stout oak-tree thus severed was afterward sent to Washington , where it is still on exhibition at the National Museum . We had not only shot down an army but also a forest . The opposing flags were in places thrust against each other , and muskets were fired with muzzle against muzzle . Skulls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with swords and bayonets thrust between the logs in the parapet which separated the combatants . Wild cheers , savage yells , and frantic shrieks rose above the sighing of the wind and the pattering of the rain , and formed a demoniacal accompaniment to the booming of the guns as they hurled their missiles of death into the contending ranks . Even the darkness of night and the pitiless storm failed to stop the fierce contest , and the deadly strife did not cease till after midnight . Our troops had been under fire for twenty hours , but they still held the position which they had so dearly purchased . My duties carried me again to the spot the next day , and the appalling sight presented was harrowing in the extreme . Our own killed were scattered over a large space near the ( ( angle , ) ) while in front of the captured breastworks the enemy 's dead , vastly more numerous than our own , were piled upon each other in some places four layers deep , exhibiting every ghastly phase of mutilation . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs and the writhing of bodies showed that there were wounded men still alive and struggling to extricate themselves from their horrid entombment . Every relief possible was afforded , but in too many cases it came too late . The place was well named the ( ( Bloody Angle . ) ) The results of the battle are best summed up in the report which the general-in-chief sent to Washington . At 6:30 P.M. , May 12 , he wrote to Halleck as follows : ( ( The eighth day of battle cleses , leaving between three and four thousand prisoners in our hands for the day 's work , including two general officers , and over thirty pieces of artillery . The enemy are obstinate , and seem to have found the last ditch . We have lost no organization , not even that of a company , whilst we have destroyed and captured one division ( Johnson 's ) , one brigade ( Doles 's ) , and one regiment entire of the enemy . ) ) The Confederates had suffered greatly in general officers . Two had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our loss in killed , wounded , and missing was less than seven thousand ; that of the enemy , between nine and ten thousand , as nearly as could be ascertained .
