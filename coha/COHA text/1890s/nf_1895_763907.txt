RIENZI , THE LAST OF THE TRIBUNES . Wagner was greatly troubled in the beginning of his career about the choice of subjects for his operas . His first famous work , ' Rienzi , ' is founded upon the same historical basis as Bulwer 's novel bearing the same name , and is a tragic opera in five acts . The composer wrote the poem and the first two acts of the score in 1838 , during his residence at Riga , and from there carried it with him to Boulogne . There he had an interview with Meyerbeer , after his memorable sea journey . Wagner submitted his libretto and the score for the first acts to that famous composer , who is reported to have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who gave him introductions to musical directors and publishers in Paris . In spite of this encouraging verdict on Meyerbeer 's part , Wagner soon discovered that there was no chance of success for ' Rienzi ' in France , and , after completing the score while dwelling at Meudon , he forwarded it in 1841 to Dresden . Here the opera found friends in the tenor Tichatscheck and the chorus-master Fisher , and when it was produced in 1842 it was received with great enthusiasm . The opera , which gave ample opportunity for great scenic display , was so long , however , that the first representation lasted from six o'clock to midnight . But when Wagner would fain have made excisions , the artists themselves strenuously opposed him , and preferred to give the opera in two successive evenings . At the third representation Wagner himself conducted with such success that ' he was the hero of the day . ' This great triumph was reviewed with envy by the admirers of the Italian school of music , and some critics went so far in their partisanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times almost vulgar . ' Notwithstanding these adverse criticisms , the opera continued to be played with much success at Dresden , and was produced at Berlin some years later , and at Vienna in 1871 . As Wagner 's subsequent efforts have greatly surpassed this first work , ' Rienzi ' is not often played , and has seldom been produced in America , I believe owing principally to its great length . The scene of ' Rienzi ' is laid entirely in the streets and Capitol of Rome , in the middle of the fourteenth century , when the city was rendered unsafe by the constant dissensions and brawls among the noble families . Foremost among these conflicting elements were the rival houses of Colonna and Orsini , and , as in those days each nobleman kept an armed retinue within a fortified enclosure in town , he soon became a despot . Fearing no one , consulting only his own pleasure and convenience , he daily sallied forth to plunder , kidnap , and murder at his will . Such being the state of affairs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared open their shops and expose their wares lest they should be summarily carried away , and young and pretty women scarcely dared venture out of their houses even at noonday , lest they should be seen and carried away by noblemen . Terrified by the lawlessness of the barons , whom he could no longer control , the Pope left Rome and took refuge at Avignon , leaving the ancient city a helpless prey to the various political factions which were engaged in continual strife . This state of affairs was so heart-rending that Rienzi , an unusually clever man of the people and an enthusiast , resolved to try and rouse the old patriotic spirit in the breast of the degenerate Romans , and to induce them to rise up against their oppressors and shake off their hated yoke . Naturally a scholar and a dreamer , Rienzi would probably never have seen the necessity of such a thing , or ventured to attempt it , had he not seen his own little brother wantonly slain during one of the usual frays between the Orsini and Colonna factions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the matter as so trivial that he never even condescended to excuse himself , or to offer any redress to the injured parties , thus filling Rienzi 's heart with a bitter hatred against all the patrician race . Secretly and in silence the young enthusiast matured his revolutionary plans , winning many adherents by his irresistible eloquence , and patiently bided his time until a suitable opportunity occurred to rally his partisans , openly defy the all-powerful barons , and restore the old freedom and prosperity to Rome . The opera opens at nightfall , with one of the scenes so common in those days , an attempt on the part of the Orsini to carry off by force a beautiful girl from the presumably safe shelter of her own home . The street is silent and deserted , the armed band steal noiselessly along , place their scaling ladder under the fair one 's casement , and the head of the Orsini , climbing up , seizes her and tries to carry her off in spite of her frantic cries and entreaties . The noise attracts the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he perceives that the would-be kidnappers wear the arms and livery of the Orsini , his hereditary foes , he seizes with joyful alacrity the opportunity to fight , and pounces upon them with all his escort . A confused street skirmish ensues , in the course of which Adrian rescues the beautiful maiden , whom he recognises as Irene , Rienzi 's only sister . Attracted by the brawl , the people crowd around the combatants , cheering and deriding them with discordant cries , and becoming so excited that they refuse to disperse when the Pope 's Legate appears and timidly implores them to keep the peace . The tumult has reached a climax when Rienzi suddenly comes upon the scene , and authoritatively reminds his adherents that they have sworn to respect the law and the Church , and bids them withdraw . His words , received with enthusiastic cries of approbation by the people , are , however , scorned by the barons , who would fain continue the strife , but are forced to desist . Anxious to renew hostilities as soon as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms , the irate noblemen then and there appoint a time and place for a general encounter outside the city gates on the morrow , when they reluctantly disperse . The appointment has been overheard by Rienzi , who , urged by the Legate of the Pope and by the clamours of the people to strike a decisive blow , decides to close the gates upon the nobles on the morrow , and to allow none to re-enter the city until they have taken a solemn oath to keep the peace and respect the law . In an impassioned discourse Rienzi then urges the people to uphold him now that the decisive moment has come , and to rally promptly around him at the sound of his trumpet , which will peal forth on the morrow to proclaim the freedom of Rome . When they have all gone in obedience to his command , the Tribune , for such is the dignity which the people have conferred upon their champion Rienzi , turns toward the girl , the innocent cause of all the uproar , and perceives for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bending anxiously over her fainting form ; but as soon as she recovers her senses she hastens to inform her brother that he saved her from Orsini 's shameful attempt , and bespeaks his fervent thanks for her young protector . It is then only that the Tribune realises that a Colonna , one of his bitterest foes , and one of the most influential among the hated barons , has overheard his instructions to his adherents , and can defeat his most secret and long cherished plans . Suddenly , however , he remembers that in youth he and Adrian often played together , and , counting upon the young nobleman 's deep sense of honour , which he had frequently tested in the past , he passionately adjures him to show himself a true Roman and help him to save his unhappy country . Irene fervently joins in this appeal , and such is the influence of her beauty and distress that Adrian , who is very patriotic and who has long wished to see the city resume its former splendour , gladly consents to lend his aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of state call elsewhere , asks Adrian to remain in his house during his absence , to protect his sister against a renewal of the evening 's outrage . Adrian joyfully accepts this charge , and the lovers , for they have been such from the very first glance exchanged , remain alone together and unite in a touching duet of faith and love , whose beautiful , peaceful strains contrast oddly with the preceding discordant strife . In spite of his transport at finding his affections returned , and in the very midst of his rapturous joy at embracing his beloved , Adrian , tortured by premonitory fears , warns Irene that her brother is far too sanguine of success , and that his hopes will surely be deceived . He also declares that he fears lest the proverbially fickle people may waver in their promised allegiance , and lest Rienzi may be the victim of the cruel barons whom he has now openly defied . The lovers ' conversation is interrupted at sunrise by the ringing of the Capitol bell , proclaiming that the revolution has begun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without , bidding all the Romans rejoice as their freedom is now assured . Riding ahead of the procession , Rienzi slowly passes by in the glittering armour and array of a Tribune , and from time to time pauses to address the crowd , telling them that the ancient city is once more free , and that he , as chief magistrate , will severely punish any and every infringement of the law . At the news of this welcome proclamation the enthusiasm of the people reaches such an exalted pitch that they all loudly swear to obey their Tribune implicitly , and loyally help him to uphold the might and dignity of the Holy City :  --  ' We swear to thee that great and free Our Rome shall be as once of yore ; To protect it from tyranny We 'll shed the last drop of our gore . Shame and destruction now we vow To all the enemies of Rome ; A new free people are we now , And we 'll defend our hearth and home . ' The scene of the second act is laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take the oath of allegiance ere they were allowed to re-enter the city , are present , as well as the numerous emissaries from foreign courts . Heralds and messengers from all parts of the land crowd eagerly around the Tribune , anxious to do him homage , and to assure him that , thanks to his decrees , order and peace are now restored . Amid the general silence the heralds make their reports , declaring that the roads are safe , all brigandage suppressed , commerce and agriculture more flourishing than ever before , a statement which Rienzi and the people receive with every demonstration of great joy . To the barons , however , these are very unwelcome tidings , and , knowing that the people could soon be cowed were they only deprived of their powerful leader , they gather together in one corner of the hall and plot how to put Rienzi to death . Adrian accidentally discovers this conspiracy , and indignantly remonstrates with the barons , threatening even to denounce them , since they are about to break their word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colonna , is one of the instigators of the conspiracy , and he dares him to carry out his threat , which would only result in branding him as a parricide . Then , without waiting to hear his son 's decision , the old baron , accompanied by the other conspirators , joins Rienzi on the balcony , whence he has just addressed the assembled people . They have been listening to his last proposal , that the Romans should shake off the galling yoke of the German Empire and make their city a republic once more , and now loud and enthusiastic acclamations rend the air . The speech ended , Adrian , stealing softly behind the Tribune , bids him be on the watch as treachery is lurking near . He has scarcely ended his warning and slipped away ere the conspirators suddenly surround the Tribune , and there , in the presence of the assembled people , they simultaneously draw their daggers , and strike him repeatedly . This dastardly attempt at murder utterly fails , however , as the Tribune wears a corselet of mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarm and secure the conspirators while the people loudly clamour for their execution by the axe , a burly blacksmith , Cecco , acting as their principal spokesman . Rienzi , who is principally incensed by their attack upon Roman liberties , and by their utter lack of faith , is about to yield to their demand , when Irene and Adrian suddenly fall at his feet , imploring the pardon of the condemned , and entreating him to show mercy rather than justice . Once more Rienzi addresses the people , but it requires all his persuasive eloquence to induce them , at last , to forgive the barons ' attempt . Then the culprits are summoned into the Tribune 's august presence , where , instead of being executed as they fully expect , they are pardoned and set free , after they have once more solemnly pledged themselves to respect the new government and its chosen representatives . This promise is wrung from them by the force of circumstances ; they have no intention of keeping it , and they are no sooner released than they utter dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ominous fear , and make them regret the clemency they have just shown . The next act is played on one of the public squares of Rome , where the people are tumultuously assembled to discuss the secret flight of the barons . They have fled from the city during the night , and , in spite of their recently renewed oaths , are even now preparing to re-enter the city with fire and sword , and to resume their former supremacy . In frantic terror , the people call upon Rienzi to deliver them , declaring that , had he only been firm and executed the nobles , Rome would now have no need to fear their wrath . Adrian , coming upon the spot as they march off toward the Capitol , anxiously deliberates what course he shall pursue , and bitterly reviles fate , which forces him either to bear arms against his own father and kin , or to turn traitor and slay the Tribune , the brother of his fair beloved . While he thus soliloquises in his despair , Rienzi appears on horseback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle song , of which the constant refrain is the Tribune 's rallying cry , ' Santo Spirito Cavaliere ! ' They are on their way to the city gates , where the assembled forces of the barons await them , and Adrian , in a last frantic attempt to prevent bloodshed , throws himself in front of Rienzi 's horse , imploring the Tribune to allow him to try once more to conciliate the rebel nobles . But Rienzi utterly refuses to yield again to his entreaties , and marches calmly on , accompanied by the people chanting the last verse of their solemn war-song . The fourth act is played in front of the Lateran church . The battle has taken place . The barons have been repulsed at the cost of great slaughter . But notwithstanding their losses and the death of their leader , the elder Colonna , the nobles have not relinquished all hope of success . What they failed to secure by the force of arms , they now hope to win by intrigue , for they have artfully won not only the Pope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side with them . The people , who have just learned that the Pope and Emperor have recalled their legates and ambassadors , are awed and frightened . Baroncelli and Cecco , two demagogues , seize this occasion to poison their fickle minds , and blame Rienzi openly for all that has occurred . Their specious reasoning that the Tribune must be very wicked indeed , since the spiritual and temporal authorities alike disapprove of him , is strengthened by the sudden appearance of Adrian , who , wild with grief at his father 's death , publicly declares he has vowed to slay the Tribune . The people  --  who , lacking the strength to uphold their convictions , now hate their leader as vehemently as they once loved and admired him  --  are about to join Adrian in his passionate cry of ' Down with Rienzi ! ' when the cardinal and his train suddenly appear , and march into the church , where a grand ' Te Deum ' is to be sung to celebrate the victory over the barons . While the Romans are wavering , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the Pope really disapproves of their chief magistrate , Rienzi marches toward the church , accompanied by Irene and his body guard . Adrian , at the sight of his pale beloved , has no longer the courage to execute his purpose and slay her only brother . Just as they are about to enter the church , where they expect to hear the joyful strains of thanksgiving , the cardinal appears at the church door , barring their entrance , and solemnly pronounces the Church 's anathema upon the horror-struck Rienzi . The people all start back and withdraw from him as from one accursed , while Adrian , seizing Irene 's hand , seeks to lead her away from her brother . But the brave girl resists her lover 's offers and entreaties , and , clinging closely to the unhappy Tribune , she declares she will never forsake him , while he vows he will never relinquish his hope that Rome may eventually recover her wonted freedom , and again shake off the tyrant 's yoke . The fifth and last act is begun in the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer , and forgetting himself entirely , fervently implores Divine protection for his misguided people and unhappy city . He has scarcely ended this beautiful prayer when Irene joins him , and , when he once more beseeches her to leave him , she declares she will never forsake him , even though by clinging to him she must renounce her love ,  --  a passion which he has never known . At this declaration , Rienzi in a passionate outburst tells how deeply he has loved and still loves his mistress , Rome , fallen and degraded though she may be . He loves her , although she has broken faith with him , has turned to listen to the blandishments of another , and basely deserted him at the time of his utmost need . Irene , touched by his grief , bids him not give way to despair , but adjures him to make a last attempt to regain his old ascendency over the minds of the fickle people . As he leaves her to follow her advice , Adrian enters the hall , wildly imploring her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans are coming , not only to slay Rienzi , but to burn down the Capitol which has sheltered him . As she utterly refuses to listen to his entreaties , he vainly seeks to drag her away . It is only when the lurid light of the devouring flames illumines the hall , and when she sinks unconscious to the floor , that he can bear her away from a place fraught with so much danger for them all . Rienzi , in the mean while , has stepped out on the balcony , whence he has made repeated but futile attempts to address the mob . Baroncelli and Cecco , fearing lest he should yet succeed in turning the tide by his marvellous eloquence , drown his voice by discordant cries , fling stones which fall all around his motionless figure like hail , and clamour for more fuel to burn down the Capitol , which they have sworn shall be his funeral pyre . Calmly now Rienzi contemplates their fury and his unavoidable death , and solemnly predicts that they will regret their precipitancy , as the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tribunes . Illustration : SENTA . THE FLYING DUTCHMAN . After leaving Riga , where he had accepted the position of Music Director , which he filled acceptably for some time , Wagner went to Pillau , where he embarked on a sailing vessel bound for London . He was accompanied by his wife and by a huge Newfoundland dog , and during this journey learned to know the sea , and became familiar with the sound of the sailors ' songs , the creaking of the rigging , the whistling of the wind , and the roar and crash of the waves . This journey made a deep impression upon his imagination . He had read Heine 's version of the legend of the Flying Dutchman , and questioned the sailors , who told him many similar yarns . He himself subsequently said : ' I shall never forget that voyage ; it lasted three weeks and a half , and was rich in disasters . Three times we suffered from the effects of heavy storms . The passage through the Narrows made a wondrous impression on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sailors , and the circumstances gave it a distinct and characteristic colour in my mind . ' One year later , when in Paris , Wagner submitted detailed sketches for this work to the Director of the Opera , to whom Meyerbeer had introduced him . The sketches were accepted , and shortly after the Director expressed a wish to purchase them . Wagner utterly refused at first to give up his claim to the plot , which he had secured from Heine ; but , finding that he could not obtain possession of the sketches , which had already been given to Foucher for versification , he accepted the miserable sum of L20 , which was all that was offered in compensation . The stolen opera was produced in Paris under the title of ' Le Vaisseau Fantome , ' in 1842 , but it was never very successful , and has been entirely eclipsed by Wagner 's version . Wagner had not , however , relinquished the idea of writing an opera upon this theme , and he finished the poem , which Spohr has designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The score was written at Meudon , near Paris , and completed , with the exception of the overture , in the short space of seven weeks . When offered in Munich and Leipsic the critics pronounced it ' unfit for Germany , ' but , upon Meyerbeer 's recommendation , it was accepted at Berlin , although no preparations were made for its immediate representation . ' The Flying Dutchman ' was first brought out at Dresden in 1843 , four years after the idea of this work had first suggested itself to the illustrious composer , who conducted the orchestra in person , while Madame Schroeder-Devrient sang the part of Senta . The audience did not receive it very enthusiastically , and , while some of the hearers were deeply moved , the majority were simply astonished . No one at first seemed to appreciate the opera at its full value except Spohr , who in connection with it wrote : ' Der Fliegende Hollaender interests me in the highest degree . The opera is imaginative , of noble invention , well written for the voices , immensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of novel effects ; at the theatre it is sure to prove clear and intelligible .... I have come to the conclusion that among composers for the stage , pro tem . , Wagner is the most gifted . ' The legend upon which the whole opera is based is that a Dutch captain once tried to double the Cape of Good Hope in the teeth of a gale , swearing he would accomplish his purpose even if he had to plough the main forever . This rash oath was overheard by Satan , who condemned him to sail until the Judgment Day , unless he could find a woman who would love him faithfully until death . Once in every seven years only did the Devil allow the Dutchman to land , in search of the maiden who might effect his release . In the first act of the opera , the seven years have just ended , and Daland , a Norwegian captain , has been forced by a tempest to anchor his vessel in a sheltered bay within a few miles of his peaceful home , where Senta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board are sleeping , and the steersman alone keeps watch over the anchored vessel , singing of the maiden he loves and of the gifts he is bringing her from foreign lands . In the midst of his song , the Flying Dutchman 's black-masted vessel with its red sails enters the cove , and casts anchor beside the Norwegian ship , although no one seems aware of its approach . The Dutchman , who has not noticed the vessel at anchor so near him , springs eagerly ashore , breathing a sigh of relief at being allowed to land once more , although he has but little hope of finding the faithful woman who alone can release him from his frightful doom :  --  ' The term is past , And once again are ended the seven long years ! The weary sea casts me upon the land . Ha ! haughty ocean , A little while , and thou again wilt bear me . Though thou art changeful , Unchanging is my doom ; Release , which on the land I seek for , Never shall I meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braved the dangers of every sea , sought death on every rock , challenged every pirate , and how vain all his efforts have been to find the death which always eludes him . Daland , waking from his sound slumbers , suddenly perceives the anchored vessel , and chides the drowsy steersman , who has not warned him of its approach . He is about to signal to the ship to ascertain its name , when he suddenly perceives the Dutchman , whom he questions concerning his home and destination . The Dutchman answers his questions very briefly , and , upon hearing that Daland 's home is very near , eagerly offers untold wealth for permission to linger a few hours by his fireside , and to taste the joys of home . Amazed at the sight of the treasures spread out before him , Daland not only consents to show hospitality to this strange homeless guest , but even promises , after a little persuasion , to allow him to woo and to win , if he can , the affections of his only daughter , Senta : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourn thy lot . As thou art bountiful , Thou showest me thy good and noble heart . My son I wish thou wert ; And were thy wealth not half as great , I would not choose another . ' Transported with joy at the mere prospect of winning the love which may compass his salvation , the Flying Dutchman proclaims in song his mingled rapture and relief , and while he sings the storm clouds break , and the sun again shines forth over the mysteriously calmed sea . The opportunity is immediately seized by the Norwegian captain , who , bidding the Dutchman follow him closely , bids the sailors raise the anchor , and sails out of the little harbour to the merry accompaniment of a nautical chorus :  --  ' Through thunder and storm from distant seas , My maiden , come I near ; Over towering waves , with southern breeze , My maiden , am I here . My maiden , were there no south wind , I never could come to thee : O fair south wind , to me be kind ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloho ! ' The next scene represents a room in Daland 's house . The rough walls are covered with maps and charts , and on the farther partition there is a striking portrait of a pale , melancholy looking man , who wears a dark beard and a foreign dress . The air is resonant with the continual hum of the whirling spinning-wheels , for the maidens are all working diligently under the direction of Maria , the housekeeper , and soon begin their usual spinning chorus . Their hands and feet work busily while two verses of the song are sung , and all are remarkably diligent except Senta , who sits with her hands in her lap , gazing in rapt attention at the portrait of the Flying Dutchman , whose mournful fate has touched her tender heart , and whose haunting eyes have made her indulge in many a long day-dream . Roused from her abstraction by the chiding voice of Mary , and by her companions , who twit her with having fallen in love with a shadow instead of thinking only of her lover Erik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to still their chatter sings them the ballad of the Flying Dutchman . When she has described his aimless wanderings and his mournful doom , which naught can change until he finds a maiden who will pledge him her entire faith , the girls mockingly interrupt her to inquire whether she would have the courage to love an outcast and to follow a spectral wooer . But when Senta passionately declares she would do it gladly , and ends by fervently praying that he may soon appear to put her love and faith to the test , they are almost as much alarmed as Erik , who enters the room in time to hear this enthusiastic outburst . Turning to Mary , the housekeeper , he informs her that Daland 's ship has just sailed into the harbour in company with another vessel , whose captain and crew he doubtless means to entertain . At these tidings the wheels are all set aside , and the maidens hasten to help prepare the food for the customary feast . Senta alone remains seated by her wheel , and Erik , placing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , but to put an end to his sorrows by promising to become his wife . His eloquent pleading has no effect upon her , however , and when he tries to deride her fancy for the pictured face , and to awaken her pity for him by describing his own sufferings , she scornfully compares them to the Dutchman 's unhappy fate :  --  ' Oh , vaunt it not ! What can thy sorrow be ? Know'st thou the fate of that unhappy man ? Look , canst thou feel the pain , the grief , With which his gaze on me he bends ? Ah ! when I think he has ne'er found relief , How sharp a pang my bosom rends ! ' Erik , beside himself with jealousy , finally tells her that he has had an ominous dream , in which he saw her greet the dark stranger , embrace him tenderly , and even follow him out to sea , where she was lost . But all this pleading only makes Senta more obstinate in her refusal of his attentions , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who at that very moment enters the house , following her father , who greets her tenderly . The sudden apparition of the stranger , whose resemblance to the portrait is very striking , robs Senta of all composure , and it is only when her father has gently reproved her for her cold behaviour that she bids him welcome . Daland then explains to his daughter that his guest is a wanderer and an exile , although well provided with this world 's goods , and asks her whether she would be willing to listen to his wooing , and would consent to ratify his conditional promise by giving the stranger her hand :  --  ' Wilt thou , my child , accord our guest a friendly welcome , And wilt thou also let him share thy kindly heart ? Give him thy hand , for bridegroom it is thine to call him , If thou but give consent , to-morrow his thou art . ' Wholly uninfluenced by the description of the stranger 's wealth which her father gives her , but entirely won by the Flying Dutchman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing he has so long and so vainly sought , Senta hesitates no longer , but generously promises to become his wife , whatever fate may await her :  --  ' Whoe'er thou art , where'er thy curse may lead thee , And me , when I thy lot mine own have made ,  --  Whate'er the fate which I with thee may share in , My father 's will by me shall be obeyed . ' This promise at first fills the heart of the Flying Dutchman with the utmost rapture , for he is thinking only of himself , and of his release from the curse , but soon he begins to love the innocent maiden through whom alone he can find rest . Then he also remembers that , if she fail , she too will be accursed , and , instead of urging her as before , he now tries to dissuade her from becoming his wife by depicting life at his side in the most unenticing colours , and by warning her that she must die if her faith should waver . Senta , undeterred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself for her beloved , again offers to follow him , and once more a rapturous thrill passes through his heart :  --  ' SENTA . Here is my hand ! I will not rue , But e'en to death will I be true . THE DUTCHMAN . She gives her hand ! I conquer you , Dread powers of Hell , while she is true . ' Daland returns into the room in time to see that they have agreed to marry , and proposes that their wedding should take place immediately , and be celebrated at the same time as the feast which he generally gives all his sailors at the end of a happy journey . The third act of this opera represents both ships riding at anchor in a rocky bay , near which rises Daland 's picturesque Norwegian cottage . All is life and animation on board the Norwegian vessel , where the sailors are dancing and singing in chorus , but the black-masted ship appears deserted , and is as quiet as the tomb . When the sailors have ended their chorus , the pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and drink for both crews , which they hail from the shore . The Norwegian sailors promptly respond to their call , and , hastening ashore , they receive their share of the feast ; but the phantom vessel remains as lifeless as before . In vain the girls offer the provisions they have brought , in vain the other crew taunt the sleepers , there is no answer given . The provisions are then all bestowed upon the Norwegians , who eat and drink most heartily ere they resume their merry chorus . Suddenly , however , the Dutch sailors rouse themselves , appear on deck , and prepare to depart , while singing about their captain , who has once more gone ashore in search of the faithful wife who alone can save him . Blue flames hover over the phantom ship , and the sound of a coming storm is borne upon the breeze . The Norwegian sailors sing louder than ever to drown this ominous sound , but they are soon too alarmed to sing , and hasten into their cabins making the sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phantom crew . The storm and lights subside as quickly and mysteriously as they appeared , and all is quiet once more as Senta comes down to the shore . Erik , meeting her , implores her to listen to his wooing , which once found favour , and to forget the stranger whom her father has induced her to accept on such short notice . Senta listens patiently to his plea , which does not in the least shake her faith in her new lover , or change her resolution to live and die for him alone . But the Dutchman , appearing suddenly , mistakes her patience for regret , and , almost frantic with love and despair , he bids her a passionate farewell and rushes off toward his ship . ' To sea ! To sea till time is ended ! Thy sacred promise be forgot , Thy sacred promise and my fate ! Farewell ! I wish not to destroy thee ! ' But Senta has not ceased to love him . She runs after him , imploring him to remain with her , protesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's passionate efforts to prevent her from doing so . The Flying Dutchman at first refuses to listen to her words , and rapidly gives his orders for departure . She is about to embark , when he suddenly turns toward her and declares that he is accursed , and that she has saved herself , by timely withdrawal , from the doom which awaits all those who fail to keep their troth :  --  ' Now hear , and learn the fate from which thou wilt be saved : Condemned am I to bear a frightful fortune ,  --  Ten times would death appear a brighter lot . A woman 's hand alone the curse can lighten , If she will love me , and till death be true . Still to be faithful thou hast vowed , Yet has not God thy promise ? This rescues thee ; for know , unhappy , what a fate is theirs Who break the troth which they to me have plighted : Endless damnation is their doom ! Victims untold have fallen ' neath this curse through me . Yet , Senta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled forevermore . ' But Senta has known from the very beginning who this dark wooer was , and is so intent upon saving him from his fate that she fears no danger for herself . Passionately she clings to him , protesting her affection , and when he looses her , and Erik would fain detain her by force , she struggles frantically to follow him . Erik 's cry brings Daland , Mary , and the Chorus to the rescue , and they too strive to restrain Senta , when they hear the stranger proclaim from the deck of his phantom ship that he is the Scourge of the Sea ,  --  the Flying Dutchman . The vessel sails away from the harbour . Senta escapes from her friends , and rushes to a projecting cliff , whence she casts herself recklessly into the seething waves , intent only upon showing her love and saving him , and thereby proving herself faithful unto death :  --  ' Praise thou thine angel for what he saith ; Here stand I , faithful , yea , till death ! ' As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as the storm abates and the rosy evening clouds appear in the west the transfigured forms of Senta and the Flying Dutchman hover for a moment over the wreck , and , rising slowly , float upward and out of sight , embracing each other , for her faithful love has indeed accomplished his salvation , and his spirit , may now be at rest . Illustration : TANNHAeUSER AND VENUS . TANNHAeUSER . In 1829 , when Wagner was only sixteen years of age , he first became acquainted , through Hoffmann 's novels , with the story of the mastersingers of Nuernberg , and with the mediaeval legend of Tannhaeuser , as versified by Ludwig Tieck . The ' mystical coquetry and frivolous catholicism ' of this modern poem repelled him , and it was not until twelve years later , when he chanced upon a popular version of the same story , that he was struck by its dramatic possibilities . A chance mention of the Saengerkrieg of the Wartburg in this version made him trace the legend as far back as possible , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and read Eschenbach 's ' Titurel ' and ' Parzival , ' which were to serve as basis for two other great operas . The sketch of the opera of ' Tannhaeuser ' was completed in 1842 , at Teplitz , during an excursion in the Bohemian mountains ; but the whole score was not finished until three years later . Wagner had gone over it all so carefully that it was printed without much revision , and he had even written the piano score , which was sent to Berlin in 1845 and appeared in the same year that the opera was produced at Dresden . Madame Schroeder-Devrient , whom Wagner had in his mind in writing the part of Venus , sang that role , but , in spite of all her talent , the first performance was not a success . She wrote to Wagner concerning it , and said , ' You are a man of genius , but you write such eccentric stuff it is hardly possible to sing it . ' The public in general , accustomed to light operas with happy endings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while some of the best musical authorities of the day applauded , others criticised the work unsparingly . Schumann alone seems to have realised the force of the author 's new style , for he wrote , ' On the whole , Wagner may become of great importance and significance to the stage , '  --  a doubtful prediction which was only triumphantly verified many years afterward . Like many of the mediaeval legends , the story of Tannhaeuser is connected with the ancient Teutonic religion , which declared that Holda , the Northern Venus , had set up her enchanted abode in the hollow mountain known as the Hoerselberg , where she entertained her devotees with all the pleasures of love . When the missionaries came preaching Christianity , they diligently taught the people that all these heathen divinities were demons , and although Holda and her court were not forgotten , she became a type of sensual love . Tannhaeuser , a minstrel of note , who has won many prizes for his songs , hearing of the wondrous underground palace and of its manifold charm , voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess 's wiles . Here he spends a whole year in her company , surrounded by her train of loves and nymphs , yielding to all her enchantments , which at first intoxicate his poetic and beauty loving soul . But at last the sensual pleasures in which he has been steeped begin to pall upon his jaded senses . He longs to tear himself away from the enchantress , and to return to the mingled pleasure and pain of earth . The first scene of the opera represents the charmed grotto where Venus gently seeks to beguile the discontented knight , while nymphs , loves , bacchantes , and lovers whirl about in the graceful mazes of the dance , or pose in charming attitudes . Seeing Tannhaeuser 's abstraction and evident sadness , Venus artfully questions him , and when he confesses his homesickness , and his intense longing to revisit the earth , she again tries to dazzle him , and cast a glamour over all his senses , so as to make him utterly oblivious of all but her . Temporarily intoxicated by her charms , Tannhaeuser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth into a song extolling her beauty and fascination ; but even before the lay is ended the longing to depart again seizes him , and he passionately entreats her to release him from her thrall :  --  ' ' T is freedom I must win or die ,  --  For freedom I can all defy ; To strife or glory forth I go , Come life or death , come joy or woe , No more in bondage will I sigh ! O queen , beloved goddess , let me fly ! ' Thus adjured , and seeing her power is temporarily ended , Venus haughtily dismisses her slave , warning him that he returns to earth in vain , as he has forfeited all chance of salvation by lingering with her , and bidding him return without fear when the intolerance of man has made him weary of life upon earth . A sudden change of scene occurs . At a sign from Venus , the grotto and its voluptuous figures disappear ; the roseate light makes way for the glaring sunshine , and Tannhaeuser , who has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highroad and the shrine of the Virgin , and within sight of the Wartburg castle , where he formerly dwelt and won many a prize for his beautiful songs . The summer silence is at first broken only by the soft notes of a shepherd singing a popular ballad about Holda , the Northern Venus , who issues yearly from the mountain to herald the spring , but as he ceases a band of pilgrims slowly comes into view . These holy wanderers are all clad in penitential robes , and , as they slowly wend their way down the hill and past the shrine , they chant a psalm praying for the forgiveness of their sins . The shepherd calls to them asking them to pray for him in Rome , and , as they pass out of sight , still singing , Tannhaeuser , overcome with remorse for his misspent years , sinks down on his knees before the Virgin 's shrine , humbly imploring forgiveness for his sins :  --  ' Oh , see my heart by grief oppressed ! I faint , I sink beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , Till heavenly mercy grants me pardon . ' While he is still kneeling there , absorbed in prayer , the Landgrave and his minstrel knights appear in hunting costume . Their attention is attracted by the bowed figure of the knight , and when he raises his head they recognise him as their former companion . Some of the minstrels , jealous of his past triumphs , would fain regard him as their foe , but , influenced by one of their number , Wolfram von Eschenbach , they welcome him kindly and ask him where he has been . Tannhaeuser , only partly roused from his half lethargic state , dreamily answers that he has long been tarrying in a land where he found neither peace nor rest , and in answer to their invitation to join them in the Wartburg declares he can not stay , but must wander on forever . Wolfram , seeing him about to depart once more , then reminds him of Elizabeth , the fair chatelaine of the Wartburg , and when he sees that , although Tannhaeuser trembles at the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will nevertheless depart , he asks and obtains the Landgrave 's permission to reveal a long kept secret . Wolfram himself has long loved the fair Elizabeth , but such is his unselfish devotion that he would fain see her happy even with a rival . To win the light back to her eyes and the smile to her lips , he now tells Tannhaeuser how she has drooped ever since he went away , and generously confesses that she took pleasure in his music only , and has persistently avoided the minstrel hall since his departure . His eloquent pleading touches Tannhaeuser 's reawakening heart , and he finally consents to accompany the Landgrave and his minstrels back to the Wartburg . Hither they now make their way on foot and on horseback , singing a triumphal chorus :  --  ' He doth return , no more to wander ; Our loved and lost is ours again . All praise and thanks to those we render Who could persuade , and not in vain . Now let your harps indite a measure Of all that hero 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , Before the fairest of the fair . ' The second act is played in the great hall of the Wartburg castle , which is festively decorated , for the minstrels are again to contend for the prize of song , a laurel wreath which will again be bestowed as of yore by the fair hands of the beloved Princess Elizabeth . As the curtain rises she is alone in the hall , no longer pale and wan , but radiant with happiness , for she knows that Tannhaeuser , her lover , has returned , and she momentarily expects him to appear . While she is greeting the well known hall , the scene of her lover 's former triumphs , with a rapturous little outburst of song , the door suddenly opens and Wolfram appears , leading the penitent Tannhaeuser , who rushes forward and falls at Elizabeth 's feet , while his friend discreetly withdraws . Elizabeth would fain raise the knight , telling him it is unbecoming for him to assume so humble an attitude beneath the roof where he has triumphed over all rivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tannhaeuser , ashamed of the past , and absorbed in the present , declares that he has been far away , in the land of oblivion , where he has forgotten all save her alone :  --  ' Far away in strange and distant regions , And between yesterday and to-day oblivion 's veil hath fallen . Every remembrance hath forever vanished , Save one thing only , rising from the darkness ,  --  That I then dared not hope I should behold thee , Nor ever raise mine eyes to thy perfection . ' Elizabeth is so happy to see him once more , so ready to forgive him at the very first word of repentance , that Tannhaeuser can not but see how dearly she loves him , and they soon unite in a duet of complete bliss , rejoicing openly over their reunion , and vowing to love each other forever , and never to part again . The Landgrave appears just as their song is ended , to congratulate Elizabeth upon having at last left her seclusion and honoured the minstrels with her presence . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know she will be there to bestow the prize , the rivalry will be greater than ever . He is interrupted in this speech , however , by the entrance of knights and nobles , who file in singing a chorus in praise of the noble hall , and of Hermann , Landgrave of Thuringia , the patron of song , whom they repeatedly cheer . When they have all taken their appointed places , the Landgrave , rising in his seat , addresses them , bidding them welcome , reminding them of the high aims of their art , and telling them that , while the theme he is about to propose for their lays is love , the princess herself will bestow as prize whatever the winner may ask :  --  ' Therefore hear now the theme you all shall sing . Say , what is love ? by what signs shall we know it ? This be your theme . Whoso most nobly this can tell , Him shall the princess give the prize . He may demand the fairest guerdon : I vouch that whatsoe'er he ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing , O gallant minstrels ! Attune your harps to love . Great is the prize , ' At the summons of the heralds , Wolfram von Eschenbach first takes up the strain , and as for him love is an ardent desire to see the loved one happy , a longing to sacrifice himself if need be , and an attitude of worshipful devotion , he naturally sings an exalted strain . It finds favour with all his hearers ,  --  with all except Tannhaeuser , who , having tasted of the passionate joys of unholy love , can not understand the purity of Wolfram 's lay , which he stigmatises as cold and unsatisfactory . In his turn , he now attunes his harp to love , and sings a voluptuous strain , which not only contrasts oddly with Wolfram 's performance , but shows love merely as a passion , a gratification of the senses . The minstrels , jealous for their art , indignantly interrupt him , and one even challenges Tannhaeuser to mortal combat :  --  ' To mortal combat I defy thee ! Shameless blasphemer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee : Thy words profane too long we 've heard ! If I of love divine have spoken , Its glorious spell shall be unbroken Strength'ning in valour , sword and heart , Altho ' from life this hour I part . For womanhood and noble honour Through death and danger I would go ; But for the cheap delights that won thee I scorn them as worth not one blow ! ' This minstrel 's sentiments are loudly echoed by all the knights present , who , having been trained in the school of chivalry , have an exalted conception of love , hold all women in high honour , and deeply resent the attempt just made to degrade them . Tannhaeuser , whose once pure and noble nature has been perverted and degraded by the year spent with Venus , can not longer understand the exalted pleasures of true love , even though he has just won the heart of a peerless and spotless maiden , and when Wolfram , hoping to allay the strife , again resumes his former strain , he impatiently interrupts him . Recklessly now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unholy pleasures of the past , Tannhaeuser exalts the goddess of Love , with whom he has revelled in bliss , and boldly reveals the fact that he has been tarrying with her in her subterranean grove . This confession fills the hearts of all present with nameless terror , for the priests have taught them that the heathen deities are demons disguised . The minstrels one and all fall upon Tannhaeuser , who is saved from immediate death at their hands only by the prompt intervention of Elizabeth . Broken-hearted , for now she knows the utter unworthiness of the man to whom she has given her heart , yet loving him still and hoping he may in time win forgiveness for his sin , she pleads so eloquently for him that all fall back . The Landgrave , addressing him , then solemnly bids him repent , and join the pilgrims on their way to Rome , where perchance the Pope may grant him absolution for his sin :  --  ' One path alone can save thee from perdition , From everlasting woe ,  --  by earth abandon 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shalt know . A band of pilgrims now assembled From every part of my domain ; This morn the elders went before them , The rest yet in the vale remain . ' T is not for crimes like thine they tremble , And leave their country , friends and home ,  --  Desire for heav'nly grace is o'er them : They seek the sacred shrine at Rome . ' Urged to depart by the Landgrave , knights , nobles , and even by the pale and sorrowful Elizabeth , Tannhaeuser eagerly acquiesces , for now that the sudden spell of sensuous love has departed , he ardently longs to free his soul from the burden of sin . The pilgrims ' chant again falls upon his ear , and , sobered and repentant , Tannhaeuser joins them to journey on foot to Rome , kneeling at every shrine by the way , and devoutly praying for the forgiveness and ultimate absolution of his sins . When the curtain rises upon the third and last act of this opera , one whole year has slowly passed , during which no tidings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for their return , and they are daily expected by their friends , who have ardently been praying that they may come home , shrived and happy , to spend the remainder of their lives at home in peace . No one has prayed as fervently as the fair Elizabeth , who , forgetting her wonted splendour , has daily wended her way down the hillside , to kneel on the rude stones in front of the Virgin 's wayside shrine . There she has daily prayed for Tannhaeuser 's happy return , and there she kneels absorbed in prayer when Wolfram comes down the path as usual . He has not forgotten his love for her , which is as deep and self-sacrificing as ever , so he too prays that her lover may soon return from Rome , entirely absolved , and wipe away her constant tears . Elizabeth is suddenly roused from her devotions by the distant chant of the returning pilgrims . They sing of sins forgiven , and of the peace won by their long , painful journey to Rome . Singing thus they slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in search of one whom they can not discover . When all have passed by , Elizabeth , realising that she will see her beloved no more , sinks slowly down on her knees , and , raising her despairing eyes to the image of the Virgin . Then she solemnly dedicates the remainder of her life to her exclusive service , in the hope that Tannhaeuser may yet be forgiven , and prays that death may soon come to ease her pain and bring her heart eternal peace :  --  ' O blessed Virgin , hear my prayer ! Thou star of glory , look on me ! Here in the dust I bend before thee , Now from this earth oh set me free ! Let me , a maiden , pure and white , Enter into thy kingdom bright ! If vain desires and earthly longing Have turn 'd my heart from thee away , The sinful hopes within me thronging Before thy blessed feet I lay . I 'll wrestle with the love I cherish 'd , Until in death its flame hath perish 'd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet in this hour , oh grant thy aid ! Till thy eternal peace thou give me , I vow to live and die thy maid . And on thy bounty I will call , That heav'nly grace on him may fall . ' This prayer ended , the broken-hearted Elizabeth slowly totters away , while Wolfram von Eschenbach , who has seen by her pallid face and wasted frame that the death she prays for will not tarry long , sorrowfully realises at last that all his love can save her no pang . When the evening shadows have fallen , and the stars illumine the sky , he is still lingering by the holy shrine where Elizabeth has breathed her last prayer . The silence of the night is suddenly broken by the sound of his harp , as he gives vent to his sorrow by an invocation to the stars , among which his lady-love is going to dwell ere-long , and as he sings the last notes a pilgrim slowly draws near . Wolfram does not at first recognise his old friend and rival Tannhaeuser in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn face he anxiously inquires whether he has been absolved , and warns him against venturing within the precincts of the Wartburg unless he has received Papal pardon for his sins . Tannhaeuser , instead of answering this query , merely asks him to point out the path , which he once found so easily , the path leading to the Venus hill , and only when Wolfram renews his questions does he vouchsafe him a brief account of his journey to Rome . He tells how he trod the roughest roads barefooted , how he journeyed through heat and cold , eschewing all comforts and alleviation of his hard lot , how he knelt penitently before every shrine , and how fervently he prayed for the forgiveness of the sin which had darkened not only his life but that of his beloved . Then , in faltering tones , he relates how the Pope shrank from him upon hearing that he had sojourned for a year in the Venus hill , and how sternly he declared there could be no more hope of pardon for such a sin than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' If thou hast shar 'd the joys of Hell , If thou unholy flames hast nurs 'd That in the hill of Venus dwell , Thou art for evermore accurs 'd ! And as this barren staff I hold Ne'er will put forth a flower or leaf , Thus shalt thou never more behold Salvation or thy sin 's relief . ' Tannhaeuser now passionately describes his utter despair , after hearing this awful verdict , his weary homeward journey , and his firm determination , since he is utterly debarred from ever seeing Elizabeth again , either in this world or in the next , to hasten back to the hill of Venus , where he can at least deaden his remorse with pleasure , and steep his sinful soul in sensual love . In vain Wolfram pleads with him not to give up all hope of ultimate salvation , and still to repent of his former sin ; he insists upon returning to the enchantress who warned him of the intolerance of man , and whom he now calls upon to guide his steps to the entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair goddess of beauty . She appears in the distance with her shadowy train , singing her old alluring song , and welcoming him back to her realm . Tannhaeuser is about to obey her beckoning hand , and to hasten after her in the direction of the Hoerselberg , when the sound of a funeral chant falls upon his ear . A long procession is slowly winding down the hill . The mourners are carrying the body of the fair Elizabeth , who has died of grief , to its last resting place . While Tannhaeuser , forgetting all else , is gazing spellbound at the waxen features of his beloved , thus slowly borne down the hill , Wolfram tells him how the pure maiden interceded for him in her last prayer on earth , and declares that he knows her innocent soul is now pleading for his forgiveness at the foot of the heavenly throne . This hope of salvation brings such relief to Tannhaeuser 's tormented heart , that he turns his back upon Venus , who , realising her prey has escaped , suddenly vanishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Elizabeth 's bier , Tannhaeuser fervently prays for forgiveness , until the bystanders , touched by his remorse , assure him that he will be forgiven ,  --  an assurance which is confirmed as he breathes his last , by the arrival of the Pope 's messenger . He appears , bearing the withered staff , which has miraculously budded and has burst forth into blossoms and leaves :  --  ' The Lord himself now thy bondage hath riven . Go , enter in with the blest in His heaven . ' Illustration : ORTRUD KNEELING BEFORE ELSA . LOHENGRIN . During a summer vacation at Teplitz in Bohemia , in 1845 , Wagner wrote the first sketch of the opera of ' Lohengrin . ' The poem was written at Dresden in 1845 , but the score was finished only in 1848 . The opera was first performed at Weimar in 1850 , under the leadership of Liszt , who was greatly interested in it , and determined to make it a success . The poet composer had taken the idea for this poem from a mediaeval legend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its poetical and musical possibilities immediately struck him , and when the opera was first played to an audience composed of musical and literary people from all parts of Europe , whom Liszt had invited to be present , it produced ' a powerful impression . ' From the memorable night of its first performance ' dates the success of the Wagner movement in Germany . ' During the next nine years this opera was given in fourteen different cities , and Wagner , who was then a political exile , is reported to have sadly remarked , ' I shall soon be the only German who has not heard Lohengrin . ' It was in 1861 , eleven years after its first performance , that he finally heard it for the first time in Vienna . This opera won for Wagner not only lasting fame , but also the enthusiastic admiration of the young Ludwig of Bavaria . Such was the impression this work made upon the young prince , who first heard it when he was only sixteen , that he resolved to do all in his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the throne of Bavaria as Ludwig II. , and one of the first independent acts of his reign was to send a messenger to invite the master to come and dwell at his court , and to assure him a yearly pension from his private purse . The young king was so infatuated with the story of ' Lohengrin ' that he not only had his residence decorated with paintings and statues representing different episodes of the opera , but used also to sail about his lake , dressed in the Swan Knight 's costume , in a boat drawn by ingeniously contrived mechanical swans . The story of this opera is as follows :  --  Henry I. , the Fowler , Emperor of Germany , about to make war against the Hungarians who threaten to invade his realm , comes to Antwerp to collect his troops , and to remind all the noblemen of Brabant of their allegiance to him . The opera opens with the trumpet call of the heralds , and by Henry 's speech to the assembled noblemen , who enthusiastically promise him the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their readiness to serve him , then informs them that he has heard rumours of trouble in their midst , and that by right of his office as high justice of the realm he would fain bring peace among them . He therefore summons Frederick of Telramund , the guardian of the dukedom of Brabant , to state the cause of dissension . This nobleman relates how the dying Duke of Brabant confided his children , Elsa and Godfrey , to his care , how tenderly he watched over them , and how much sorrow he felt when the young heir , having gone out in the forest to walk with his sister one day , failed to return . Frederick of Telramund then goes on , and tells how he could not but suspect Elsa of her brother 's murder . He had therefore renounced her hand , which he had once hoped to win , had married Ortrud , daughter of Radbod , the heathen king and former possessor of all this tract of land , which he now claims as his own by right of inheritance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Elsa ; but when Frederick declares she murdered her brother so as to become sole mistress of the duchy , and to bestow it upon some unworthy lover , the king sends for the maiden , and , hanging his shield upon an oak , declares he will not depart until he has tried this cause :  --  ' HERALD . Now shall the cause be tried as ancient use requires . KING . Never again my shield to wear Till judgment is pronounced , I swear . ' The people receive this decree with joy , and the men , drawing their swords , thrust them into the ground as they form a circle around the king . These preparations for a solemn court of justice are scarcely ended when Elsa appears , all in white , and attended by her ladies , who stand in the background while she timidly advances and stands before the king . Her youth , beauty , and apparent innocence produce a great effect , not only upon the bystanders , but also upon the king , who gently begins to question her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maiden merely bows and wrings her hands , exclaiming , ' My hapless brother ! ' until the king implores her to confide in him . Suddenly her tongue is loosened , and she begins to sing , as if in a trance , of a vision with which she has been favoured , wherein a handsome knight had been sent by Heaven to become her champion :  --  ' I saw in splendour shining A knight of glorious mien , On me his eye inclining With tranquil gaze serene ; A horn of gold beside him , He leant upon his sword . Thus when I erst espied him ' Mid clouds of light he soared ; His words so low and tender Brought life renewed to me . My guardian , my defender , Thou shalt my guardian be . ' These words and the maiden 's rapt and innocent look are so impressive , that the king and people utterly refuse to believe the maiden guilty of crime , until Frederick of Telramund boldly offers to prove the truth of his assertion by fighting against any champion whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she hopes her heaven-sent champion may appear . The lists are immediately prepared , while the herald calls aloud :  --  ' He who in right of Heaven comes here to fight For Elsa of Brabant , step forth at once . ' The first call remains unanswered ; but , at Elsa 's request , the king commands a second to be made , while she sinks on her knees and ardently begins praying for her champion 's appearance . Her prayer is scarcely ended when the men along the bank become aware of the approach of a snowy swan , drawing a little skiff , in which a handsome young knight in full armour stands erect . Amid the general silence of the amazed spectators , Lohengrin , the Swan Knight , springs ashore , and , turning to his swan , dismisses it in a beautiful song , one of the gems of this opera :  --  ' I give thee thanks , my faithful swan . Turn thee again and breast the tide ; Return unto that land of dawn Where joyous we did long abide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trusty swan . ' Then , while the swan slowly sails down the river and out of sight , the Swan Knight announces to the king that he has come as Elsa 's champion , and , turning to her , asks whether she will be his wife if he proves victorious . Elsa gladly promises him her hand , nor does she even offer to withdraw this promise when he tells her that she must trust him entirely , and never ask who he is or whence he comes :  --  ' Say , dost thou understand me ? Never , as thou dost love me , Aught shall to question move thee From whence to thee I came , Or what my race and name . ' Elsa faithfully promises to remember all these injunctions , and bids him do battle for her , whereupon he challenges Telramund , with whom he begins fighting at a given signal . The Swan Knight soon defeats his enemy , who is thus convicted of perjury by the judgment of God , but he magnanimously refuses to take his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for saving her , he clasps her in his arms , while Telramund and Ortrud , his wife , bewail their disgrace , for , according to the law of the land , they are doomed to poverty and exile . Their sorrow , however , is quite unheeded by the enthusiastic spectators , who set Elsa and Lohengrin upon their shields , and then bear them off in triumph , to the glad accompaniment of martial strains :  --  ' CHORUS . We sing to thee ,  --  we praise thee , To highest honour raise thee . Stranger , we here greet thee delighted . Wrong thou hast righted ; We gladly greet thee here . Thee , thee we sing alone . Thy name shall live in story . Oh , never will be one to rival thee in glory ! ' It is night when the curtain rises upon the second act ; the knights are still revelling in the part of the palace they occupy , while the women 's apartments are dark and still . The street is deserted , and on the steps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despoiled of their rich garments , and are now clad like beggars . Frederick , who feels his disgrace , bitterly reproaches his wife for having blasted his career , and seeks to induce her to depart with him ere day breaks ; but Ortrud refuses to go . She is not yet conquered , and passionately bids him rouse himself , and listen to her plan , if he would recover his honour , retrieve his fortunes , and avenge himself for his public defeat . She first persuades him that the Swan Knight won the victory by magic arts only , which was an unpardonable offence , and then declares that , if Elsa could only be prevailed upon to disobey her champion 's injunctions and ask his name , the spell which protects him would soon be broken , and he would soon become their prey . Telramund , overjoyed at the prospect of wiping out his disgrace , acquiesces eagerly , and as Elsa just then appears at her window and softly apostrophises the evening breeze , Ortrud creeps out of the shadow and timidly addresses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moved by compassion at the sight of the haughty woman thus laid low , and touched by the pretended repentance she shows , Elsa , whom happiness has made even more tender than usual , eagerly hastens down with two of her attendants , and , opening the door , bids her come in , promising to intercede in her behalf on the morrow . During the subsequent brief conversation Ortrud artfully manages to make Elsa vaguely uneasy , and to sow in her innocent mind the first seeds of suspicion . Frederick of Telramund , in the mean while , has watched his wife disappear with Elsa , and , hiding in a niche of the old church , he sees the gradual approach of day , and hears the herald proclaiming through the streets the Emperor 's ban upon him :  --  ' Our king 's august decree through all the lands I here make known ,  --  mark well what he commands : Beneath a ban he lays Count Telramund For tempting Heaven with traitorous intent . Whoe'er shall harbour or companion him By right shall share his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also hears the herald announce Elsa 's coming marriage with the heaven-sent Swan Knight , and grimly tells the bystanders he will soon unmask the traitor . A few minutes later , when he has returned to his hiding place , he sees Elsa appear in bridal array , followed by her women , and by Ortrud , who is very richly clad . But at the church door Ortrud insolently presses in front of Elsa , claiming the right of precedence as her due , and taunting her for marrying a man who has won her by magic arts only , and whose name and origin she does not even know . This altercation is interrupted by the appearance of the king and his attendants , among whom is the Swan Knight . He hastens to Elsa 's side , while the monarch imperiously demands the cause of strife . Lohengrin tenderly questions Elsa , who tells him all . As Ortrud 's venomous insinuations have had no apparent effect upon her , he is about to lead her into the church , when Telramund suddenly steps forward , loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imploring Elsa not to believe a word he says . These accusations are , however , dismissed by the king and his men , since Elsa passionately refuses to credit them , and the wedding procession sweeps into the church , followed by the vindictive glances of Telramund and Ortrud ,  --  glances which the trembling Elsa alone seems to perceive . The third act takes place on that selfsame evening . The festivities are nearly ended , and through opposite doors the wedding procession enters the nuptial chamber to the accompaniment of the well known Bridal Chorus . The attendants soon depart , however , leaving Elsa and Lohengrin to join in a duet of happy married love . Now that they are alone together for the first time , Elsa softly begins chiding her lover for not showing more confidence in her , and revealing who he is . In spite of his tender attempts to turn aside the conversation into a less dangerous channel , she gradually becomes more importunate :  --  ' Oh , make me glad with thy reliance , Humble me not that bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Him that I love , oh let me know ! ' Seeing her husband does not yield to her tender pleading , Elsa then redoubles her caresses . Her faint suspicions have taken such firm root , and grow with such rapidity , that she is soon almost wild with suspense . All his attempts to soothe her only seem to excite her more , and suddenly , fancying that she hears the swan boat coming to bear him away from her , she determines to break the magic spell at any cost , as Ortrud cunningly advised her , and demands his name . Just as Lohengrin is gazing upon her in heart-rending but mute reproach , Telramund bursts into the room , with a band of hired assassins , to take his life . A quick motion from Elsa , whose trust returns when she sees her beloved in danger , permits Lohengrin to parry the first blow with his sword , and Frederick of Telramund soon lies dead upon the floor , while his accomplices cringe at Lohengrin 's feet imploring his pardon . Day is dawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsa , bids the would-be assassins bear the corpse into the presence of the king , where he promises to meet Elsa and satisfy all her demands :  --  ' Bear hence the corpse into the king 's judgment hall . Into the royal presence lead her . Arrayed as fits so fair a bride ; There all she asks I will concede her , Nor from her knowledge aught will hide . ' At the last scene the king is again near the river , on his judgment throne , whence he watches the mustering of the troops which are to accompany him to the war , and makes a patriotic speech , to which they gladly respond . Suddenly , however , the four men appear with the corpse of Frederick of Telramund , which they lay at the king 's feet , declaring they are obeying the orders of the new lord of Brabant , who will soon come to explain all . Before the king can question further , Elsa appears , pale and drooping , in spite of her bridal array , and just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her bridegroom is only leaving her for a short time to lead his troops to the fray , the Swan Knight appears , and is enthusiastically welcomed by his men . Sadly he informs them he can no longer lead them on to victory , and declares that he slew Frederick of Telramund in self-defence , a crime for which he is unanimously acquitted . Then he sadly goes on to relate that Elsa has already broken her promise , and asked the fatal question concerning his name and origin . Proudly he tells them that he has no cause to be ashamed of his lineage , as he is Lohengrin , son of Parsifal , the guardian of the Holy Grail , sent from the temple on Mount Salvatch to save and defend Elsa . The only magic he had used was the power with which the Holy Grail endowed all its defenders , and which never forsook them until they revealed their name :  --  ' He whom the Grail to be its servant chooses Is armed henceforth by high invincible might ; All evil craft its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dwells takes flight . Nor will he lose the awful charm it lendeth , Although he should to distant lands , When the high cause of virtue he defendeth : While he 's unknown , its spells he still commands . ' Now , he adds , the sacred spell is broken , he can no longer remain , but is forced to return immediately to the Holy Grail , and in confirmation of his word the swan and skiff again appear , sailing up the river . Tenderly the Swan Knight now bids the repentant Elsa farewell , gently resisting her passionate attempts to detain him , and giving her his sword , horn , and ring , which he bids her bestow upon her brother when he returns to protect her . This boon is denied him , because she could not keep faith with him for one short year , at the end of which time he would have been free to reveal his name , and her missing brother would have been restored to her by the power of the Holy Grail . Placing the fainting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down toward the swan boat , amid the loud lamentations of all the people , One person only is glad to see him depart , Ortrud , the wife of Telramund , and , thinking he can no longer interfere , she cruelly taunts Elsa with her lack of faith , and confesses that her magic arts and heathen spells have turned the heir of Brabant into the snowy swan which is even now drawing the tiny skiff . These words , which fill the hearts of Elsa and all the spectators with horror and dismay , are however overheard by Lohengrin , who , accustomed to rely upon Divine aid in every need , sinks upon his knees , and is rapt in silent prayer . Suddenly a beam of heavenly light streams down upon his upturned face , and the white dove of the Holy Grail is seen hovering over his head . Lohengrin , perceiving it , springs to his feet , looses the golden chain which binds the swan to the skiff , and as the snowy bird sinks out of sight a fair young knight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive that he is in truth , as Lohengrin proclaims , the missing Godfrey of Brabant , released from bondage by the power of the Holy Grail . Elsa embraces her brother with joy , the king and nobles gladly welcome him , and Ortrud sinks fainting to the ground . Lohengrin , seeing that his beloved has now a protector , springs into the skiff , whose chain is caught by the dove , and rapidly drawn out of sight . As it vanishes , Elsa sinks lifeless to the ground with a last passionate cry of ' My husband ! ' and all gaze mournfully after him , for they know they will never see Lohengrin , the Swan Knight , again . Illustration : TRISTAN 'S DEATH . TRISTAN AND YSOLDE . It was in 1854 , when still an exile from his native land , that Wagner , weary of his long work , ' The Ring of the Niblungs , ' of which only the first two parts were completed , conceived the idea of using the legend of Tristan as basis for a popular opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opera was played in Munich only in 1865 for the first time . The libretto is based on an ancient Celtic myth or legend , which was very popular during the Middle Ages . It was already known in the seventh century , but whether it originally came from Wales or Brittany is a disputed point . It was very widely known , however , and , thanks to the wandering minstrels , it was translated into all the Continental idioms , and became the theme of many poets , even of later times . Since the days when Godfried of Strasburgh wrote his version of the story it has been versified by many others , among whom , in our days , are Matthew Arnold and Swinburne . While the general outline of these various versions remains the same , the legend has undergone many transformations , but Wagner has preserved many of the fundamental ideas of the myth , which is intended to illustrate the overpowering force of passion . The scene was originally laid in Ireland , Cornwall , and French Brittany . Blanchefleur , sister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who dies shortly after their union . Withdrawing to her husband 's castle in Brittany , Blanchefleur gives birth to a child whom she calls Tristan , as he is the child of sorrow , and , feeling that she can not live much longer , she intrusts him to the care of her faithful steward , Kurvenal . When the young hero has reached the age of fifteen , his guardian takes him over to Cornwall , where King Mark not only recognises him as his nephew , but also designates him as his heir . Tristan has been carefully trained , and is so expert in the use of his arms that he soon excites the envy of the courtiers , who are watching for an opportunity to do him harm . The King of Cornwall , having been defeated in battle by the King of Ireland , is obliged to pay him a yearly tribute , which is collected by Morold , a huge giant and a relative of the Irish king . Morold , coming as usual to collect the tribute money , behaves so insolently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaying him . A challenge is given and accepted , and after a terrible combat , such as the mediaeval poets love to describe with minute care , the giant falls , after wounding Tristan with his poisoned spear . The King of Cornwall , instead of sending the wonted tribute to Ireland , now forwards Morold 's head , which is piously preserved by Ysolde , the Irish princess , who finds in the wound a fragment of sword by which she hopes to identify the murderer , and avenge her kinsman 's death . Tristan , finding that the skill of all the Cornwall leeches can give him no relief , decides to go to Ireland and claim the help of Ysolde the princess , who , like her mother , is skilled in the art of healing , and knows the antidote for every poison . Fearing , however , lest she may seek to avenge Morold 's death , he goes alone , disguised as a harper , and presents himself before her as Tantris , a wandering minstrel . His precarious condition touches Ysolde 's compassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish his cure , tenderly nursing him back to health . While sitting beside him one day , she idly draws his sword from the scabbard , and her sharp eyes perceive that a piece is missing . Comparing the break in the sword with the fragment in her possession , she is soon convinced that Morold 's murderer is at her mercy , and she is about to slay her helpless foe when an imploring glance allays her wrath . Tristan , having entirely recovered under her care , takes leave of the fair Ysolde , who has entirely lost her heart to him , and returns to Cornwall , where he relates his adventures , and speaks in such glowing terms of Ysolde 's beauty and goodness that the courtiers finally prevail upon the king to sue for her hand . As the courtiers have tried to make the king believe that his nephew would fain keep him single lest he should have an heir , Tristan reluctantly accepts the commission to bear the king 's proposals and escort the bride to Cornwall . Ysolde is of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her love ; but when he makes his errand known , she proudly conceals her grief , and prepares to accompany the embassy to Cornwall , taking with her her faithful nurse , Brangeane . The Queen of Ireland , another Ysolde , well versed in every magic art , then brews a mighty love potion , which she intrusts to Brangeane 's care , bidding her conceal it in her daughter 's medicine chest , and administer it to the royal bride and groom on their wedding night , to insure their future happiness by deep mutual love . Wagner 's opera opens on shipboard , where Ysolde lies sullen and motionless under a tent , brooding over her sorrow and nursing her wrath against Tristan , who has further embittered her by treating her with the utmost reserve , and never once approaching her during the whole journey . The call of the pilot floats over the sea , and Ysolde , roused from her abstraction , asks Brangeane where they are . When she learns that the vessel is already within sight of Cornwall , where a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and openly regrets that she does not possess her mother 's power over the elements , as she would gladly conjure a storm which would engulf the vessel and set her free from a life she abhors . Brangeane , alarmed at this outburst , vainly tries to comfort her , and as the vessel draws near the land she obeys Ysolde 's command and goes to summon Tristan into her presence . Approaching the young hero , who is at the helm , the maid delivers her message , but Tristan refuses to comply , under pretext of best fulfilling his trust by steering the vessel safe to land :  --  ' In every station Where I stand I serve with life and blood The pearl of womanhood :  --  If I the rudder Rashly left , Who steer 'd then safely the ship To good King Mark 's fair land ? ' He further feigns to misunderstand the purport of her message , by assuring her that the discomforts of the journey will soon be over . Kurvenal , his companion , incensed by Brangeane 's persistency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master Tristan , the slayer of Morold , is not the vassal of any queen , and the nurse returns to the tent to report her failure . Ysolde , however , has overheard Kurvenal 's speech , and when she learns that Tristan refuses to obey her summons , she comments bitterly upon his lack of gratitude for all her tender care , and confides to Brangeane how she spared him when he was ill and at her mercy . Brangeane vainly tries to make her believe that Tristan has shown his appreciation by wooing her for the king rather than for himself , and when Ysolde murmurs against a loveless marriage , she shows her the magic potion intrusted to her care , which will insure her becoming a loving and beloved wife . The sight of the medicine chest in which it is secreted unfortunately reminds Ysolde that she too knows the secret of brewing draughts of all kinds , so she prepares a deadly potion , trying all the while to make Brangeane believe that it is a perfectly harmless drug , which will merely make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kurvenal suddenly appears to announce that they are about to land , and to bid her prepare to meet the king , who has seen their coming and is wending his way down to the shore to bid her welcome . Ysolde haughtily replies that she will not stir a step until Tristan proffers an apology for his rude behaviour and obeys her summons . After conferring together for a few moments , Tristan and Kurvenal agree that it will be wiser to appease the irate beauty by yielding to her wishes , than to have an esclandre , and Tristan prepares to appear before her . Ysolde , in the mean while , has passionately flung herself into Brangeane 's arms , fondly bidding her farewell , and telling her to have the magic draught she has prepared all ready to give to Tristan , with whom she means to drink atonement . While Brangeane , who mistrusts her young mistress , is still pleading with her to forget the past , Tristan respectfully approaches the princess , and when she haughtily reproves him for slighting her commands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed it his duty to keep his distance :  --  ' Good breeding taught , Where I was upbrought , That he who brings The bride to her lord Should stay afar from his trust . ' Ysolde retorts , that , as he is such a rigid observer of etiquette , it would best behoove him to remember that as yet he has not even proffered the usual atonement for shedding the blood of her kin , and that his life is therefore at her disposal . Tristan , seeing she is bent upon revenge , haughtily hands her his sword , telling her that , since Morold was so dear to her , she had better avenge him . Under pretext that King Mark might resent such treatment of his nephew and ambassador , Ysolde refuses to take advantage of his defencelessness , and declares she will consider herself satisfied if he will only pledge her in the usual cup of atonement , which she motions to Brangeane to bring . The bewildered handmaiden hastily pours a drug into the cup . This she tremblingly brings to her mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , tells Tristan his loathsome task will soon be over , and that he will soon be able to relinquish her to the care of his uncle . Tristan , suspecting that the contents of the cup are poisonous , nevertheless calmly takes it from her hand and puts it to his lips . But ere he has drunk half the potion , Ysolde snatches it from his grasp and greedily drains the rest . Instead of the ice-cold chill of death which they both expected , Tristan and Ysolde suddenly feel the electric tingle of love rushing madly through all their veins , and , forgetting all else , fall into each other 's arms , exchanging passionate vows of undying love . Brangeane , the only witness of this scene , views with terror the effect of her subterfuge , for , fearing lest her mistress should injure Tristan or herself , she had hastily substituted the love potion intrusted to her care for the poison Ysolde had prepared . While the lovers , clasped in each other 's arms , unite in a duet of passionate love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the royal bridegroom is waiting , and it is only when Brangeane throws the royal mantle over Ysolde 's shoulders , and when Kurvenal bids them step ashore , that the lovers suddenly realise that their brief dream of love is over . The sudden revulsion from great joy to overwhelming despair proves too much for Ysolde 's delicate frame , and she sinks fainting to the deck , just as King Mark appears and the curtain falls upon the first act . Several days are supposed to have elapsed , when the second act begins . Ysolde after her fainting fit has been conveyed to the king 's palace , where she is to dwell alone until her marriage takes place , and where she forgets everything except the passion which she feels for Tristan , who now shares all her feelings . In a hurried private interview the lovers have arranged a code of signals , and it is agreed that as soon as the light in Ysolde 's window is extinguished her lover will join her as speedily as possible . It is a beautiful summer night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying away on the evening breeze , when Ysolde turns to Brangeane , and impatiently bids her put out the light . The terrified nurse refuses to do so , and implores Ysolde not to summon her lover , declaring that she is sure that Melot , one of the king 's courtiers , noted her pallor and Tristan 's strange embarrassment . In vain she adds that she knows his suspicions have been aroused , and that he is keeping close watch over them both to denounce them should they do anything amiss . Ysolde refuses to believe her . The princess is so happy that she makes fun of her attendant 's forebodings , and , after praising the tender passion she feels , she again bids her put out the light . As Brangeane will not obey this command , Ysolde , too much in love to wait any longer , finally extinguishes the light with her own hand , and bids her nurse go up in the watch-tower and keep a sharp lookout . Ysolde then hastens to the open door , and gazes anxiously out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming of her lover , and runs to meet and embrace him when at last he appears . Blissful in each other 's company , Tristan and Ysolde now forget all else , while they exchange passionate vows and declarations of love , bewailing the length of the days which keep them apart , and the shortness of the nights during which they can see each other . In a passionate duet of mutual love and admiration , they also rejoice that , instead of dying together , as Ysolde had planned , they are still able to live and love . Brangeane , posted in the watch-tower above , repeatedly warns them that they had better part , but her wise advice proves useless , and it is only when she utters a loud cry of alarm that Tristan and Ysolde start apart . Simultaneously almost with Brangeane 's cry , Kurvenal rushes upon the scene with drawn sword , imploring his master to fly ; but ere this advice can be followed King Mark and the traitor Melot appear , closely followed by all the royal hunting party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her lover , sinks fainting to the ground , while Tristan , wishing to shield her as much as possible from the scornful glances of these men , stands in front of her with his mantle outspread . He , too , is overwhelmed with shame , and silently bows his head when his uncle bitterly reproves him for betraying him , and robbing him of the bride he had already learned to love . Even the sentence of banishment pronounced upon him seems none too severe , and Tristan , almost broken-hearted at the sight of his uncle 's grief , sadly turns to ask Ysolde whether she will share his lot . Shame and discovery have in no wise diminished her affection for him , and when she promises to follow him even to the end of the earth he can not restrain his joy , and notwithstanding the king 's presence he passionately clasps her in his arms : ' Wherever Tristan 's home may be , That will Ysolde share with thee : That she may follow And to thee hold , The way now shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , rushes upon Tristan with drawn sword , and wounds him so sorely that he falls back unconscious in Kurvenal 's arms , while Ysolde , clinging to him , faints away as the curtain falls on the second act . The third act is played in Tristan 's ancestral home in Brittany , whither he has been conveyed by Kurvenal , who vainly tries to nurse his wounded master back to health and strength . The sick man is lying under a great linden tree , in death-like lethargy , while Kurvenal anxiously watches for the vessel which he trusts will bring Ysolde from Cornwall . She alone can cure his master 's grievous wound , and her presence only can woo him back from the grave into which he seems rapidly sinking . From time to time Kurvenal interrupts his sad watch beside the pallid sleeper to call to a shepherd piping on the hillside , and to inquire of him whether he descries any signs of the coming sail . Slowly and feebly Tristan at last opens his eyes , gazes dreamily at his attendant and surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently tells him that he bore him away from Cornwall while wounded and unconscious , and brought him home to recover his health amid the peaceful scenes of his happy youth ; but Tristan sadly declares that life has lost all its charms since he has parted from Ysolde . In a sudden return of delirium the wounded hero then fancies he is again in the forest , watching for the light to go out , until Kurvenal tells him that Ysolde will soon be here , as he has sent a ship to Cornwall to bring her safely over the seas . These tidings fill Tristan 's heart with such rapture that he embraces Kurvenal , thanking him brokenly for his lifelong devotion , and bidding him climb up into the watch-tower that he may catch the first glimpse of the coming sail . While Kurvenal is hesitating whether he shall obey this order and leave his helpless patient alone , the shepherd joyfully announces the appearance of the ship . Kurvenal , ascending the tower , reports to his master how it rounds the point , steers past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to land . Tristan has feverishly listened to all these reports , and bids Kurvenal hasten down to bring Ysolde to him ; then , left alone , he bursts forth into rapturous praise of the happy day which brings his beloved to him once more , and of the deep love which has called him back from the gates of the tomb . His impatience to see Ysolde soon gets the better of his weakness , however , and he struggles to rise from his couch , although the exertion causes his wounds to bleed afresh . Painfully he staggers half across the stage to meet Ysolde , who appears only in time to hear his last passionate utterance of her beloved name , and to catch his dying form in her arms . She does not realise that he has breathed his last , however , and gently tries to woo him back to life , and make him open his eyes . But when all her efforts have failed , and she finds his heart no longer beats beneath her hand , she reproaches him tenderly for leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kurvenal , standing beside the lovers , speechless with grief , is roused to sudden action by the shepherd 's hurried announcement that a second ship has arrived , and that King Mark , Melot , and all his train , are about to appear . Frenzied with grief , and thinking that they have come once more to injure his master , Kurvenal seizes his sword , and , springing to the gate , fights desperately until he has slain Melot , and falls mortally wounded at Tristan 's feet . While the fight is taking place , King Mark and Brangeane , standing without the castle wall , vainly call to him to stay his hand , as they have come with friendly intentions only , and now that he can resist them no longer they all come rushing in . They are horror-struck at the sight of Tristan and Ysolde , both apparently dead ; but Brangeane , having discovered that her mistress has only swooned , soon restores her to consciousness . King Mark hastens to assure Ysolde that she and Tristan are both forgiven ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love potion which she administered , he realises that they could not but yield to its might . Ysolde , however , pays no heed to his words , but , gazing fixedly at Tristan , she mournfully extols his charms and love , until her heart breaks with grief , and she too sinks lifeless to the ground . No restoratives can now avail to recall the life which has flown forever , and King Mark blesses the corpses of the lovers , and of the faithful servant who has expired at their feet , as the curtain falls . Illustration : WALTHER CROWNED BY EVA . THE MASTER SINGERS OF NUREMBERG . When Richard Wagner was only sixteen years of age he read with great enthusiasm one of Hoffmann 's novels entitled ' Saengerkrieg , ' giving a romantic account of the ancient musical contests at the Wartburg in Bavaria . The impression made upon him by this account was first utilised in his opera of ' Tannhaeuser , ' when his attention was attracted also to the picturesque possibilities of the guilds formed by the burghers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made definite use of this material , and began the sketch for his only comic opera . The first outline was drawn during a sojourn in the Bohemian mountains , when he felt in an unusually light and festive mood . But the work was soon set aside , and was not resumed until 1862 , when it was finished in Paris . The score was then begun , and written almost entirely at Biberich on the Rhine , and Wagner himself conducted the overture for the first time at a concert in Leipzig . This fragment was very well received and there was an ' enthusiastic demand for a repetition , in which the members of the orchestra took part as much as the audience . ' The opera itself , however , was first performed under Von Buelow , in 1868 , at Munich . The best singers of the day took the principal parts , and the result of their united efforts was ' a perfect performance ; the best that had hitherto been given of any work of the master . ' The opera , at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , as we have already stated , Wagner 's first and only attempt to write in the comic vein , and the text is full of witty and cutting allusions to the thick-headed critics ( at whose hands Wagner had suffered so sorely ) , who sweepingly condemn everything that does not conform to their fixed standard . During all the Middle Ages , and more especially in the middle of the thirteenth century , the quaint old city of Nuremberg was the seat of one of the most noted musical guilds , or German training schools for poets and musicians . The members of this fraternity were all burghers , instead of knights like the Minnesingers , and held different ranks according to their degree of proficiency . They were therefore called singers when they had mastered a certain number of tunes ; poets when they could compose verses to a given air ; and Master Singers when they could write both words and music on an appointed theme . The musical by-laws of this guild were called ' Tabulatur , ' and every candidate was forced to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief examiner , who bore the title of Marker . The opera opens in the interior of St. Catharine 's church in Nuremberg , where a closing hymn in honour of St. John is being sung . Eva Pogner and her maid , Magdalena , have been present at the service , and are still standing in their pew . But , in spite of her handmaiden 's energetic signs and nudges , the young lady pays but little heed to the closing hymn , and turns all her attention upon a handsome young knight , Walther von Stolzenfels , who , as the last note dies away , presses eagerly forward and enters into conversation with her . To secure a few moments ' private interview Eva sends her maid back to the pew , first for her forgotten kerchief , next for a pin which she has lost , and lastly for her prayer-book . During these temporary absences the deeply enamoured youth implores Eva to tell him whether she is still free , and whether her heart and hand are still at her own disposal . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , overhearing the question , declares that her mistress 's hand has already been promised ,  --  a statement which Eva modifies by adding that her future bridegroom is yet to be chosen . As these contradictory answers greatly puzzle Walther , she hurriedly explains that her father , the wealthiest burgher of the town , wishing to show his veneration for music , has promised his fortune and her hand to a Master Singer , the preference being given to the one who will win the prize on the morrow . The only proviso made is that the girl may remain free if the bridegroom does not win her approval , and Eva timidly confesses that she will either marry Walther or remain single all her life . Magdalena , who has been carrying on a lively flirtation of her own with David , the sexton , now suddenly hurries her young mistress off , bidding the knight apply to David if he would learn any more concerning the musical test about to take place , and in the same breath she promises her lover some choice dainties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlighten and favour her mistress 's suitor . ' Let David supply all The facts of the trial .  --  David , my dear , just heed what I say ! You must induce Sir Walther to stay . The larder I 'll sweep , The best for you keep ; To-morrow rewards shall fall faster If this young knight is made Master . ' Walther , who has just passionately declared to Eva that he knows he could become both poet and musician for her sweet sake , since her father has vowed never to allow her to marry any but a Master , now listens attentively to David 's exposition of the school 's rules and regulations . In the mean while the apprentices come filing in , prepare the benches and chairs , arrange the Marker 's curtained box , and gayly chaff each other as they join in an impromptu dance . They only subside when Pogner , Eva 's father , enters with Beckmesser , an old widower , the Marker of the guild , who flatters himself he can easily win the prize on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victor should receive the maiden 's hand without her consent being asked . He fears lest the capricious fair one may yet refuse to marry him , and decides to make sure of her by singing a serenade under her window that very night . But when he sees the handsome young candidate step forward and receive the support of Pogner , ( who has already made his acquaintance , and who evidently is inclined to favour him , ) the widower looks very glum indeed , and vindictively resolves to prevent his entrance into the guild by fair means or by foul . Hans Sachs , the poet shoemaker of Nuremberg , and all the other members of the guild , having now appeared , Beckmesser calls the roll , and Pogner repeats his offer to give his fortune and daughter to the winner of the prize on the morrow , and charges the guild to select their candidates for the contest . Of course the very first thing to be done is to examine the new candidate . Walther , when questioned concerning his teachers and method , boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses love as his theme for a trial song , and bursts forth into an impassioned and beautiful strain . But as his words and music are strictly original , and therefore can not be judged by the usual canons , Beckmesser savagely marks down mistake after mistake , and brusquely interrupts the song to declare the singer is ' outsung and outdone . ' In proof of this assertion he exhibits his slate , which is covered with bad marks . Hans Sachs , the only member present who has understood the beauty of this original lay , vainly tries to interfere in Walther 's behalf , but his efforts only call forth a rude attack on Beckmesser 's part , who advises him to reserve his opinions , stick to his last , and finish the pair of shoes which he has promised him for the morrow . Walther is finally allowed to finish his song , but the prejudiced and intolerant citizens of Nuremberg utterly refuse to receive him in their guild , and he rushes out of the hall in despair , for he has lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by competing for the prize on the morrow . His departure is a signal for a tumultuous breaking up of the meeting , the apprentices dancing as before , as soon as their masters have departed . The second act represents one of the tortuous alleys and a long straight street of the quaint old city of Nuremberg . On one side is Hans Sachs 's modest shoemaker 's shop , on the other the entrance to Pogner 's stately dwelling . It is evening , and David , the shoemaker 's apprentice , is leisurely putting up the shutters , when his attention is suddenly attracted by Magdalena , who appears with a basket of dainties . She however refuses to give them to him until he tells her the result of the musical examination . When she hears that Walther has failed and has been refused admittance to the guild , she pettishly snatches the basket from his grasp and flounces off in great displeasure . The other apprentices , who in the mean while have slyly drawn near , now make unmerciful fun of David , who stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . This rough play is soon ended by the appearance of Hans Sachs . He orders all the apprentices to bed , and , by a judicious application of his strap , drives David into the house . Quiet has just been restored once more , when Pogner and Eva come sauntering down the street , returning from their customary evening walk , and sit down side by side on the bench in front of their door . Here Pogner tries to sound his daughter 's feelings , and to discover whether she has any preference among the morrow 's candidates , reiterating his decision , however , that he will never allow her to marry any one except a man who has publicly won the title of Master Singer . As he can not ascertain his daughter 's feelings , he soon enters the house , while Eva lingers outside watching for Walther 's promised visit . She is soon joined by Magdalena , who sorrowfully tells her that Walther has been rejected ; but , as she can give no details about the examination , Eva timidly approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cobbler is sitting at work near his window , singing a song of his own composition , and the maiden soon enters into a bantering conversation with her old friend . In answer to Hans Sachs 's questions , she soon confides to him that she can not endure Beckmesser , and to flatter him into a good humour she archly suggests that , as he too is a widower , he ought to compete for her hand . Hans Sachs , who is far too shrewd not to see through her girlish fencing , now resolves to discover whether she is as indifferent to the young knight , and in order to do so he drops a few careless and contemptuous remarks about him , which drive the young lady away in a very bad temper . Smiling maliciously at the success of his ruse , the cobbler cheerfully continues his work , while Eva rejoins Magdalena , who informs her that Beckmesser has signified his intention to serenade her that very night . Eva cares naught for the widower 's music , and , only intent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses to re-enter the house ; so Magdalena leaves her to answer Pogner 's call . A few moments later Walther himself comes slowly down the street ; but , in spite of Eva 's rapturous welcome , he remains plunged in melancholy , for he has forfeited all hope of winning her on the morrow . The sound of the watchman 's horn drives the young people apart , and while Eva vanishes into the house , Walther hides under the shadow of the great linden tree in front of Sachs 's house . His presence has been detected by the shoemaker , who makes no sign , and when the night watchman has gone by , singing the hour and admonishing all good people to go to bed , he perceives a female form glide softly out of the house and join the knight . This female is Eva , who has exchanged garments with Magdalena , and has prevailed upon her to pose at her window during the serenade , while she tries to comfort her beloved . Crouching in the shade , the lovers now plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , and when they are about to leave their hiding-place and depart , he flings open his shutter so that a broad beam of light streams across the old street . It makes such a brilliant illumination that it is impossible for any one to pass unseen . This ruse , which proves such a hindrance to the lovers , is equally distasteful to Beckmesser , who has come down the street and has taken his stand near them to tune his lute and begin his serenade . Before he can utter the first note , Hans Sachs , having become aware of his presence also , and maliciously anxious to defeat his plans , lustily entones a noisy ditty about Adam and Eve , hammering his shoes to beat time . Beckmesser , who has seen Eva 's window open , and longs to make himself heard , steps up to the shoemaker 's window . In answer to his testy questions why he is at his bench at such an hour , Hans Sachs good-humouredly replies that he must work late to finish the shoes about which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to silence the shoemaker and sing his serenade , Beckmesser artfully pretends that he would like to have Sachs 's opinion of the song he intends to sing on the morrow , and proposes to let him hear it then . After a little demur the shoemaker consents , upon condition that he may give a tap with his hammer every time he hears a mistake , and thus carry on the double office of marker and of cobbler . Beckmesser is , however , so angry and agitated that his song is utterly spoiled , and he makes so many mistakes that the cobbler 's hammer keeps up an incessant clatter . These irritating sounds make the singer more nervous still , and he sings so loudly and so badly that he rouses the whole neighbourhood , and heads pop out of every window to bid him be still . David also ventures to peer forth , and , seeing that the serenade is directed to Magdalena , whom he recognises at the window above , his jealous anger knows no bounds . He springs out of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cudgel . The Nuremberg apprentices , who are divided up into numerous rival guilds , and who are always quarrelling , seize this occasion to bandy words , which soon result in bringing them all out into the street , where a free fight takes place between the rival factions of journeymen and apprentices . Magdalena , seeing her beloved David in peril screams aloud , until Pogner , deceived by her apparel , pulls her into the room and closes the window , declaring he must go and see that all is safe . Sachs , who has closed his shutter at the first sounds of the fight , steals out into the street , approaches the young lovers , and , pretending to take Eva for Magdalena , he thrusts her quickly into Pogner 's house , and drags Walther into his own dwelling just as the sound of the approaching night watch is heard . As if by magic the brawlers suddenly disappear , the windows close , the lights are extinguished , and as the watchman turns the corner the street has resumed its wonted peaceful aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans Sachs 's shop , where the cobbler is absorbed in reading and oblivious of the presence of his apprentice David , who comes sneaking in with a basket which he has just received from Magdalena . Taking advantage of his master 's absorption , David examines the ribbons , flowers , cakes , and sausages with which it is stocked , starting guiltily at his master 's every movement , and finally seeking to disarm the anger he must feel at the evening 's brawl by offering him the gifts he has just received . Hans Sachs , however , good-naturedly refuses to receive them , and after making his apprentice sing the song for the day he dismisses him to don his festive attire , for he has decided to take him with him to the festival . Left alone , Sachs soliloquises on the follies of mankind , until Walther appears . In reply to his host 's polite inquiry how he spent the night , Walther declares he has been visited by a wonderful dream , which he goes on to relate . At the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful song , conforming to all the Master Singers ' rigid rules , and he hastily jots down the words , bidding the young knight be careful to retain the tune . As they both leave the room to don their festive apparel , Beckmesser comes limping in . He soon discovers the verses on the bench , and pockets them , intending to substitute them for his own in the coming contest . Sachs , coming in , denies all intention of taking part in the day 's programme , and when Beckmesser jealously asks why he has been inditing a love song if he does not intend to sue for Eva 's hand , he discovers the larceny . He , however , good-naturedly allows Beckmesser to retain the copy of verses , and even promises him that he will never claim the authorship of the song , a promise which Beckmesser intends to make use of so as to pass it off as his own . Triumphant now and sure of victory , Beckmesser departs as Eva enters in bridal attire . She is of course devoured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , as excuse for her presence , she petulantly complains that her shoe pinches . Kneeling in front of her , Sachs investigates the matter , greatly puzzled at first by her confused and contradictory statements and by her senseless replies to his questions . He is turning his back to the inner door , through which Walther has also entered the shop , but , soon becoming aware of the cause of her perturbation , he deftly draws the shoe from her foot , and going to his last pretends to be very busy over it , while he is in reality listening intently to discover whether Eva 's presence will inspire Walther with the third and last verse of his song . His expectations are not disappointed , for the knight , approaching the maiden softly , declares his love in a beautiful song . As the last notes die away , the cobbler joyfully exclaims that Walther has composed a Master Song , calls Eva and David ( who has just entered ) as witnesses that he composed it , foretells that , if Walther will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the prize , and , patting Eva in a truly paternal fashion , he bids her be happy , for she will yet be able to marry the man she loves . David , who has been made journeyman so that he can bear witness for Walther , greets the happy Magdalena with the tidings that they no longer need delay , but can marry immediately . After the four happy young people and Hans Sachs have given vent to their rapture in a beautiful quintette , they adjourn to the meadow outside of the town , where the musical contest is to take place . The peasants and apprentices are merrily dancing on the green , and cease their mirthful gyrations only when the Master Singers appear . Hans Sachs addresses the crowd , reads the conditions of the test , proclaims what the prize shall be , and concludes by inviting Beckmesser to come forth and begin his song . The young people assembled hail this elderly candidate with veiled scorn , and Beckmesser , painfully clambering to the eminence where the candidates are requested to stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has had no time to become familiar , are entirely unadapted to his tune , so he draws them out , clips them , loses the thread of the verses , and fails in every sense . In his chagrin at having made himself ridiculous , and in anger because his colleagues declare the words of his song have no sense , he suddenly turns upon Hans Sachs , and , hoping to humiliate him publicly , accuses him of having written the song . Hans Sachs , of course , disowns the authorship , but stoutly declares the song is a masterpiece , and that he is sure every one present will agree with him if they hear it properly rendered to its appropriate tune . As he is a general favourite among his townsmen , he soon prevails upon them to listen to the author and composer and decide whether he or Beckmesser is at fault . Walther then springs lightly up the turfy throne , and , inspired by love , he sings with all his heart . The beautiful words , married to an equally beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , who hail him as victor , while the blushing Eva places the laurel crown upon his head . Pogner , openly delighted with the favourable turn of affairs , gives him the badge of the guild , and heartily promises him the hand of his only daughter . As for Hans Sachs , having publicly proved that his judgment was not at fault , and that he had been keen enough to detect genius even when it revealed itself in a new form , he is heartily cheered by all the Nurembergers , who are prouder than ever of the cobbler poet who has brought about a happy marriage :  --  ' Hail Sachs ! Hans Sachs ! Hail Nuremberg 's darling Sachs ! ' Illustration : THE RHINE MAIDENS . THE NIBELUNG 'S RING .  --  RHEINGOLD . It was in 1848 , after the completion of Tannhaeuser , that Wagner looked about for a subject for a new opera . Then ' for the last time the conflicting claims of History and Legend presented themselves . ' He had studied the story of Barbarossa , intending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nibelungen Myths , which he decided to dramatise. 1 His first effort was an alliterative poem entitled ' The Death of Siegfried , ' which , however , was soon set aside , a part of it only being incorporated in ' The Twilight or Dusk of the Gods . ' Wagner was then dwelling in Dresden , and planning the organisation of a national theatre ; but the political troubles of 1849 , which resulted in his banishment , soon defeated all these hopes . After a short sojourn in Paris , Wagner took up his abode in Zurich , where he became a naturalised citizen , and where he first turned all his attention to the principal work of his life ,  --  ' The Nibelungen Ring . ' In connection with this work Wagner himself wrote : ' When I tried to dramatise the most important moment of the mythos of the Nibelungen in Siegfried 's Tod , I found it necessary to indicate a vast number of antecedent facts , so as to put the main incidents in the proper light . But I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative that they should be embodied in the action . Thus I came to write Siegfried . But here again the same difficulty troubled me . Finally I wrote " Die Walkuere " and " Das Rheingold , " and thus contrived to incorporate all that was needful to make the action tell its own tale . ' The completed poem was privately printed in 1853 , and published ' as a literary product ' ten years later , when the author was in his fiftieth year . As for the score , it was begun in 1853 , and Wagner says : ' During a sleepless night at an inn at Spezzia , the music of " Das Rheingold " occurred to me ; straightway I turned homeward and set to work . ' Such was the energy with which he laboured that the complete score of the Rheingold was finished in 1854 . Two years later the music to the Walkyrie was all done , and Siegfried begun . But pecuniary difficulties now forced the master to undertake more immediately remunerative work , and , ' tired of heaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished ' Tristan and Ysolde . ' He then thought he would never be able to finish his grand work , and wrote : ' I can hardly expect to find leisure to complete the music , and I have dismissed all hope that I may live to see it performed . ' Fortunately for him , however , Ludwig II . of Bavaria had heard ' Lohengrin ' when only sixteen , and , a passionate lover of music and art , he had become an enthusiastic admirer of the great composer . One of the very first acts of his reign was , therefore , to despatch his own private secretary to Wagner with the message , ' Come here and finish your work . ' As this message was backed by a small pension which would enable the musician to keep the wolf from the door , he hopefully went to Munich . But , in spite of the sovereign 's continued favour , Wagner found so many enemies that the sojourn there became very unpleasant . It was then that the architect Semper made the first plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Nibelungen Ring ' should be played , as he had formally commissioned Wagner to complete the work . Driven away from his native land once more by the bitterness of his enemies , Wagner , who still enjoyed Ludwig 's entire favour , withdrew in 1865 to Triebschen , where the ' Ring ' progressed steadily . It was there , in 1869 , that he completed the Siegfried score , and began that of ' The Twilight of the Gods , ' which was finished only some time later . As the King 's plan for building a national theatre for the representation of ' The Nibelungen Ring ' had to be abandoned , the scheme was taken up by the municipality of the little town of Bayreuth . Wagner was cordially invited to take up his residence there , and settled in his new home in 1872 , when he was already sixty years of age . Thanks to munificent private subscriptions secured in great part by the Wagner societies in various parts of the world , the long planned theatre was finally begun . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was performed there in the month of August , the very best singers of the day taking all the principal parts , which they rendered to the best of their abilities . The result was a magnificent performance , a musical triumph ; but as the venture was not a financial success , the performances were not repeated in the following summer . Several new ventures , however , were made , and another Wagner festival has just taken place , of which the real result is yet unknown , although the attendance was very large , the audience being composed of people from all parts of the world . Thus Wagner completed and rendered the series of operas , which include plays ' for three days and a fore evening , ' whence the series is generally called a ' trilogy , ' although it is really composed of four whole operas . Away down in the translucent depths of the Rhine , three beautiful nymphs , Woglinde , Wellgunde , and Flosshilde , daughters of the river-god , dart in and out among the jagged rocks . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priceless treasure of the deep , whence comes all the warm golden light which illumines the utmost recesses of their dark and damp abode . The nymphs suddenly pause in their merry game , for the wily dwarf Alberich has emerged from one of the sombre chasms . He is a Nibelung , a spirit of night and darkness , and slowly gropes his way to one of the upper ridges , whence he can see the graceful forms of the nymphs , watch their merry evolutions , and overhear them repeatedly admonish each other to keep watch over the gleaming treasure , which their father , the Rhinegod , has intrusted to their keeping , warning them that just such a dark and misshapen creature as the dwarf would try to wrest it from their grasp :  --  ' Guard the gold ! Father said That such was the foe . ' But all Alberich 's senses are fascinated by the water-nymphs ' beauty , and he soon falls madly in love with them , and makes almost superhuman efforts to overtake the mocking fair . Hotly he pursues them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another , and is beside himself with rage as they deftly escape from his clasp just as he fancies he has at last caught them . The fair nymphs , who know they have nothing to fear from so infatuated a lover , swim hither and thither , tantalising him by their nearness , and lure him up and down the rocky river-bed . They have just exhausted his patience , and driven him wild with impotent rage , when the green waters are suddenly illumined by the phosphorescent glow of the Rhinegold , the treasure whose presence they hail with a rapturous outburst of song , and whose secret power they extol :  --  ' The realm of the world By him shall be won Who from the Rhinegold Hath wrought the ring Imparting measureless power . ' 2 The dwarf , attracted by the brilliant light , hears their words at first without paying any attention to them ; but when they repeat that he who is willing to forego love can fashion a ring from this gold which will make him master of all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glow of the treasure , and forgetting all thoughts of love in greed , he suddenly grasps the carelessly guarded gold and plunges with it down into the depths , leaving the three nymphs to bewail its loss in utter darkness . Little by little the gloom lightens , however , and instead of the river bed the scene represents the green valley through which the Rhine is flowing . In the gray dawn one can descry the high hills on either side , and as the light increases Wotan and Fricka , the principal deities of Northern mythology , are seen lying on the flowery slopes . As they gently awaken from their peaceful slumbers , the morning mists entirely disappear , revealing in the background the fairy-like beauty of a wondrous palace which has just been completed for their abode . This sight startles Fricka , for she knows that the assembled gods have promised that Fasolt and Fafnir , the gigantic builders , should have sun and moon and the fair Freya as fee . To lose the bright luminaries of the world were bad enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parting forever with the fair goddess of beauty and youth . In her sorrow she bitterly regrets that the promise has been made and rendered inviolable by being inscribed on her husband 's spear , and reproves him for the joy he shows in viewing the completion of his future abode :  --  ' In delight thou revel'st When I am alarmed ? Thou ' rt glad of the fortress , For Freya I fear . Bethink thee , thou thoughtless god , Of the guerdon now to be given ! The castle is finished , And forfeit the pledge . Forgettest thou what is engaged ? ' Thus suddenly brought to his senses , Wotan , king of the Northern gods , protests that he never really intended to part with the beauty , light , and sweetness of life , and seeks to excuse himself by urging that Loge , the god of fire and the arch-deceiver , overpersuaded him by promising to find some way of escape from the fatal bargain :  --  ' He whom I hearkened to swore To find a safety for Freya ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still discussing the matter , and eagerly wondering why Loge does not appear , when Freya comes rushing wildly upon the stage , with fear-blanched face and trembling limbs , breathlessly imploring the father of the gods to save her from the two huge giants in close pursuit . In her terror she also summons her devoted brothers , Donner and Fro . But , in spite of the strength of these potent gods of the sunshine and thunder , the giants boldly advance , boasting aloud of their achievement , and demanding the fulfilment of the stipulated contract . The gods are almost at their wits ' end with anxiety , when Loge , god of fire , appears . They loudly clamour to him to keep his word and release them from the consequences of their rash bargain . In reply to this summons , Loge declares he has wandered everywhere in search of something more precious than youth and love , and that he has utterly failed to find it . No one , he says , is ready to relinquish these blessed gifts ,  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming treasure which he has just stolen from the Rhine nymphs . Loge concludes his speech by delivering to Wotan an imploring message from the defrauded maidens , who summon him to avenge their wrongs and help them to recover the stolen gold . The description of the gleaming treasure , of the power of the ring which Alberich has fashioned out of it , and especially of the immense hoard which he has amassed by the unlimited sway which the ring enables him to wield over all the underground folk , has so greatly fascinated the giants , that , after a few moments ' consultation , they step forward , offering to relinquish all claim to the previously promised reward , providing the hoard is theirs ere nightfall . This said , they bear the shrieking and reluctant Freya away as a hostage , and vanish in the distance . As they depart , the light suddenly grows wan and dim . The goddess who has just departed is the dispenser of the golden apples of perennial youth according to Wagner , and , as she vanishes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , suddenly lose all their vigour and bloom , and grow visibly old and gray , to their openly expressed dismay :  --  ' Without the apples , Old and hoar  --  Hoarse and helpless  --  Worth not a dread to the world , The dying gods must grow . ' This sudden change , especially in his beloved wife Fricka , determines Wotan to secure the gold at any price , and he bids Loge lead the way to Alberich 's realm , following him bravely down through a deep cleft in the rock , whence rises a dense mist , which soon blots the whole scene from view . In the mean while , the dwarf Alberich has conveyed the gleaming Rhinegold to his underground dwelling , where , mindful of the nymphs ' words , he has forced his brother and slave , the smith Mime , to fashion a ring . No sooner has Alberich put on this trinket than he finds himself endowed with unlimited power , which he uses to oppress all his race , and to pile up a mighty hoard , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fearful lest any one should wrest the precious ring from him , he next directs Mime to make a helmet of gold , the magic tarn-helm , which will render the wearer invisible . Mime is at work at his underground forge , and has just finished the helmet which he intends to appropriate to his own use to escape thraldom , when Alberich suddenly appears , snatches it from his trembling hand , and , placing it upon his head , becomes invisible to all . The malicious dwarf misuses this power to torture Mime with his whip , and rushes off to lash the dwarfs in the rear of the cave as Wotan and Loge suddenly appear . Of course their first impulse is to inquire the cause of Mime 's writhing and bitter cries , and from him they hear how Alberich has become lord of the Nibelungs by the might of his ring and magic helmet . In corroboration of this statement , the gods soon behold a long train of dwarfs toiling across the cave , bending beneath their burdens of gold and precious stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he plies with merciless vigour . He is visible now , for he has hung the magic helmet to his belt ; but he no sooner becomes aware of the gods ' presence than he strides up to them , and haughtily demands their name and business . Disarmed a little by Wotan 's answer , that they have heard of his new might and have come to ascertain whether the accounts were true , Alberich boasts of his power to compel all to bow before his will , and says he can even change his form , thanks to his magic helmet . At Loge 's urgent request , the dwarf then gives them an exhibition of his power by changing himself first into a huge loathsome dragon , and next into a repulsive toad . While in this shape he is made captive by the gods , deprived of his tarn-helm , and compelled to surrender his hoard as the price of his liberty . Before departing , Wotan even wrests from his grasp the golden ring , to which he desperately clings , for he knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the power to collect more gold . In his rage at being deprived of it , Alberich hurls his curse after the gods , declaring the ring will ever bring death and destruction to the possessor :  --  ' As by curse I found it first , A curse rest on the ring ! Gave its gold To me measureless might , Now deal its wonder Death where it is worn ! ' This curse uttered , he disappears , and while mist invades the place the scene changes , and Loge and Wotan stand once more on the grassy slopes , where Fricka , Donner , and Fro hasten to welcome them , and to inquire concerning the success of their enterprise . Almost at the same moment , the giants Fasolt and Fafnir also appear , leading Freya , whom Fricka would fain embrace , but who is withheld from her longing arms . The grim giants vow that no one shall even touch their fair captive until they have received a pile of gold as high as their staffs , which they drive into the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonished , Loge and Fro pile up the gleaming treasure , which is surmounted by the glittering helmet , whose power the giants do not know . Freya is entirely hidden , and only a chink remains through which the giants can catch a glimpse of her golden hair . They insist upon having this chink closed up ere they will relinquish Freya , so Wotan is forced to give up the magic ring . But he draws it from his finger only when Erda , the shadowy earth goddess , half rises out of the ground to command the sacrifice of the treasure which Alberich stole from the Rhine maidens . As the stipulated ransom has all been paid , the giants release Freya . She joyfully embraces her kin , and under her caresses they recover all their former youth and bloom . In the mean while the giants produce their bags , but soon begin quarrelling together about the division of the hoard , and appeal to the gods to decide their dispute . The gods are all too busy to pay any heed to this request , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize the ring and pay no heed to the rest . As the ring is accursed , Fafnir remorselessly slays his brother to obtain it ; then , packing up all the treasure in his great bag , he triumphantly departs . To disperse the shadow hovering over Wotan 's brow ever since he has been obliged to sacrifice the ring , Thor now beats the rocks with his magic hammer , and conjures a brief storm . The long roll of thunder soon dies away , and when the fitful play of the lightning is ended Thor shows the assembled gods a glittering rainbow bridge of quivering , changing hues , which stretches from the valley where they are standing to the beautiful portals of the wondrous palace Walhalla , the home of the gods ! Fascinated by this sight , Wotan invites the gods to follow him over its lightly swung arch , and as they trip over the rainbow bridge , the lament of the Rhine-maidens mourning their treasure falls in slow , pitiful cadences upon their ears :  --  ' Rhinegold ! Purest gold ! O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfailing faith Is found in the deep , While above , in delight , Faintness and falsehood abide ! ' 1 See the author 's ' Myths of Northern Lands ' and ' Legends of the Rhine . ' 2 All the quotations in the ' Ring ' have been taken either from Dippold 's or Forman 's admirable translations . Illustration : BRUNHILDE DISCOVERING SIEGMUND AND SIEGLINDE . THE WALKYRIE . Wotan  --  made secretly uneasy by Erda 's dark prediction that ' Nothing that is ends not ; A day of gloom Dawns for the gods ;  --  Be ruled and waive from the ring '  --  relinquishes the ring which he had wrested from Alberich , as has been seen . His restlessness however daily increases , until at last he penetrates in disguise into the dark underground world and woos the fair earth goddess . So successfully does he plead his cause , that she receives him as her spouse and bears him eight lovely daughters . She also reveals to him the secrets of the future , when Walhalla 's strong walls shall fall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud and lent a willing ear to Loge , prince of evil . Notwithstanding this fatal prediction Wotan remains undismayed . Instead of yielding passively to whatever fate may befall him , he resolves to prepare for a future conflict , and to defend Walhalla against every foe . As the gods are few in number , he soon decides to summon mortals to his abode , and in order to have men trained to every hardship and accustomed to war , he flings his spear over the world , and kindles unending strife between all the nations . His eight daughters , the Walkyries , are next deputed to ride down to earth every day and bear away the bravest among the slain . These warriors are entertained at his table with heavenly mead , and encouraged to keep up their strength and skill by cutting and hewing each other , their wounds healing magically as soon as made . But , in spite of these preparations , Wotan is not yet satisfied . He still remembers the all-powerful ring which he has given to the giants , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ring again falls into the hands of the revengeful Alberich , he knows the gods can not hope to escape from his wrath . He himself can not snatch back a gift once given , so he decides to beget a son , who will unconsciously be his emissary , and who will , moreover , oppose the offspring which Erda has predicted that Alberich will raise merely to help him avenge his wrongs . Disguised as a mortal named Waelse , or Volsung , Wotan takes up his abode upon earth , and marries a mortal woman , who bears him twin children , Siegmund and Sieglinde . These children are still very young when Hunding , a hunter and lover of strife , comes upon their hut in the woods , and burns it to the ground , after slaying the elder woman and carrying off the younger as his captive . On their return from the forest , Waelse and Siegmund behold with dismay the destruction of their dwelling , and vow constant warfare against their foes . This vow they faithfully keep until Siegmund grows up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nothing but the wolf-skin garment to which he owes his name . Hunding , in the mean while , has carried Sieglinde off to his dwelling , which is built around the stem of a mighty oak , and when she attains a marriageable age he compels her to become his wife , although she very reluctantly submits to his wish . The opening scene of this opera represents Hunding 's hall ,  --  in the midst of which stands the mighty oak whose branches overshadow the whole house ,  --  which is dimly illumined by the fire burning on the hearth . Suddenly the door is flung wide open , and a stranger rushes in . He is dusty and dishevelled , and examines the apartment with a wild glance . When he has ascertained that it is quite empty , he comes in , closes the door behind him , and sinks exhausted in front of the fire , where he soon falls asleep . A moment later Sieglinde , Hunding 's forced wife , appears . When she sees a stranger in front of the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in sudden fear . But , reassured by the motionless attitude of the stranger , she soon draws near , and , bending over him , discovers that he has fallen asleep :  --  ' His heart still heaves , Though his lids be lowered , Warlike and manful I deem him Though wearied down he sunk . ' As she has only a very dim recollection of her past , she fails to recognise her brother in the sleeper . He soon stirs uneasily , and , wakening , tries to utter a few words , which his parched lips almost refuse to articulate , until she compassionately gives him a drink . Gazing at Sieglinde as if fascinated by some celestial vision , Siegmund , in answer to her questions , informs her that he is an unhappy wight , whose footsteps misfortune constantly dogs . He then goes on to inform her that even now he has escaped from his enemies with nothing but his life , and makes a movement to leave her for fear lest he should bring ill-luck upon her too . Sieglinde , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her husband . Almost as she speaks Hunding enters the house , and , allowing her to divest him of his weapons , seems dumbly to inquire the reason of the stranger 's presence at his hearth . Sieglinde rapidly explains how she found him faint and weary before the fire , and Hunding , mindful of the laws of hospitality , bids the stranger welcome , and invites him to partake of the food which Sieglinde now sets before them . As Siegmund takes his place at the rude board , Hunding first becomes aware of the strange resemblance he bears to his wife , and after commenting upon it sotto voce , he inquires his guest 's name and antecedents . Siegmund then mournfully relates his happy youth , the tragic loss of his mother and sister , his roaming life with his father , and the latter 's mysterious disappearance . Only then does Hunding recognize in him the foe whom he has long been seeking to slay . Unconscious of all this , Siegmund goes on to relate how on that very day he had fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running away only when his weapons had failed him and the maiden had been slain at his feet . Sieglinde listens breathless to the story of his sad life and of his brave defence of helpless virtue , while Hunding suddenly declares that , were it not that the sacred rights of hospitality restrained him , he would then and there slay the man who had made so many of his kinsmen bite the dust . He however contents himself with making an appointment for a hostile encounter early on the morrow , promising to supply Siegmund with a good sword , since he has no weapons of his own :  --  ' My doors ward thee , Woelfing , to-day ; Till the dawn shelter they show ; A flawless sword Will befit thee at sunrise , By day be ready for fight , And pay thy debt for the dead . ' Then Hunding angrily withdraws with his wife , taking his weapons with him , and muttering dark threats , which fill his guest 's heart with nameless fear . Left alone , Siegmund bitterly mourns his lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherously attacked by his foe , and in his sorrow he reproaches his father , who had repeatedly told him that he would find a sword ready to his hand in case of direst need . ' A sword ,  --  so promised my father  --  In sorest need I should find  --  Weaponless falling In the house of the foe , Here in pledge To his wrath I am held . ' While he is brooding thus over his misfortunes , the flames on the hearth flicker and burn brighter . Suddenly their light glints upon the hilt of a sword driven deep in the bole of the mighty oak , and , reassured by the thought that he has a weapon within reach , Siegmund disposes himself to sleep . The night wears on . The fire flickers and dies out . The deep silence is broken only by Siegmund 's peaceful breathing , when the door noiselessly opens , and Sieglinde , all dressed in white , steals into the room . She glides up to the sleeping guest and gently rouses him , bidding him escape while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opiate which she has secretly administered :  --  ' It is I ; behold what I say ! In heedless sleep is Hunding , I set him a drink for his dreams , The night for thy safety thou needest . ' Leading him to the oak , she then points out the sword , telling him it was driven into the very heart of the tree by a one-eyed stranger . He had come into the hall on her wedding day , and had declared that none but the mortal for whom the gods intended the weapon would ever be able to pull it out . She then goes on to describe how many strong men have tried to withdraw it , and warmly declares it must have been intended for him who had so generously striven to protect a helpless maiden . Her tender solicitude fills the poor outcast 's famished heart with such love and joy that he clasps her to his breast , and , the door swinging noiselessly open to admit a flood of silvery moonbeams , they join in the marvellous duet known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon each other , they too perceive the strong resemblance which has so struck Hunding , but still fail to recognize each other as near of kin . To save Sieglinde from her distasteful compulsory marriage , Siegmund now consents to fly , providing she will accompany him , vowing to protect her till death with the sword which he easily draws from the oak , and which he declares he knows his father must have placed there , as he recognizes him in the description which Sieglinde had given of the stranger :  --  ' Siegmund the Volsung , Seest thou beside thee ! For bridal gift He brings thee this sword . He woos with the blade The blissfullest wife . From the house of the foe He hies with thee . Forth from here Follow him far , Hence to the laughing House of the Spring , Where Nothung the sword defends thee , Where Siegmund infolds thee in love ! ' This passionate appeal entirely sweeps away Sieglinde 's last scruples ; she yields rapturously to his wooing , and they steal away softly , hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide world . Hunding , upon awaking on the morrow , discovers the treachery of his guest and the desertion of his wife . Almost beside himself with fury , he prepares to overtake and punish the guilty pair . As a fight is now imminent between Siegmund , his mortal son , and Hunding , Wotan , who is up on a rocky mountain overlooking the earth , summons Brunhilde the Walkyrie to his side , bidding her saddle her steed and so direct the battle that Siegmund may remain victor and Hunding only fall . Chanting her Walkyrie war-cry , Brunhilde departs , laughingly calling out to Wotan that he had best be prepared for a call from his wife , who is hastening toward him as fast as her rams can draw her brazen chariot . Brunhilde has scarcely passed out of sight when Fricka comes upon the scene . After upbraiding Wotan for forsaking her to woo the goddess Erda and a mortal maiden , she says that , as father of the gods and ruler of the world , he is bound to uphold religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the just consummated union between Siegmund and Sieglinde , who are brother and sister , and finally forces her husband , much against his will , to promise he will revoke his decree , give the victory to the injured husband , Hunding , and punish Siegmund , the seducer , by immediate death . Wotan therefore summons Brunhilde once more , and sadly bids her to shield Hunding in the coming fight . Brunhilde , who realizes that the second command has been dictated by Fricka , implores him to confide his troubles to her . She then hears with dismay an account of the way in which Wotan has been beguiled into wrongdoing by Loge , of his attempts to gather an army large enough to oppose to his foes when the last day should come , and of his long cherished hope that Siegmund would recover the fatal ring which he feared would again fall into the revengeful Alberich 's hands . Finally , however , Wotan repeats his order to her to befriend Hunding , and Brunhilde , awed by his despair , slowly departs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutterings of thunder , expressive of his wrath if any one dare to disobey his behests , when Siegmund and Sieglinde suddenly appear upon the mountain side . They are fleeing from Hunding , and Sieglinde , who has discovered when too late that Siegmund is her brother , is so torn by remorse , love , and fear that she soon sinks fainting to the ground . Siegmund , alarmed , bends over her , but , having ascertained that she has only fainted , makes no effort to revive her , deeming it better that she should remain unconscious during the encounter which must soon take place , for the horn of the pursuing Hunding is already heard in the distance . Siegmund has just pressed a tender kiss upon Sieglinde 's fair forehead , when Brunhilde , the Walkyrie , suddenly appears before him , and solemnly warns him of his coming defeat and death . He proudly tells her of his matchless sword , but she informs him that his reliance upon it is quite misplaced , for it will be wrenched from his grasp when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by describing the glory which awaits him in Walhalla , whither she will convey him after death . Siegmund eagerly questions her , but , learning that Sieglinde can never be admitted within its shining portals , passionately declares he can not leave her . He next proposes to kill her and himself , so that they may be together in Hela 's dark abode , for he will accept no joys which she can not share :  --  ' Then greet for me Valhall , Greet for me Wotan ; Hail unto Waelse , And all the heroes ! Greet , too , the graceful Warlike mist-maidens : For now I follow thee not . ' Brunhilde 's heart is so touched by his love for and utter devotion to Sieglinde , and she is so anxious at the same time to fulfil Wotan 's real wish , in defiance of his orders , that she finally allows compassion to get the better of her reason , and impulsively promises Siegmund that she will protect him in the coming fray . At the same moment Hunding 's horn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rapid approach of a thunderstorm . Such is the darkness that Siegmund , who has sprung down the path in his eagerness to meet his foe , misses his way , while Sieglinde slowly rouses from her swoon , muttering of the days of her happy childhood when she dwelt with her family in the great wood . Suddenly , the lightning flashes , and Hunding and Siegmund , meeting upon a ridge , begin fighting , in spite of Sieglinde 's frantic cries . As the struggle begins , Brunhilde , true to her promise , hovers over the combatants , holding her shield over Siegmund and warding off every dangerous blow , while Sieglinde gazes in speechless terror upon the combatants . But in the very midst of the fray , when Siegmund is about to pierce Hunding 's heart with his glittering sword , Wotan suddenly appears , and , extending his sacred spear to parry the blow , he shivers the sword Nothung to pieces . Hunding basely takes advantage of this accident to slay his defenceless foe , while Brunhilde , fearing Wotan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sieglinde and bears her rapidly away upon her fleet-footed steed . After gazing for a moment in speechless sorrow at his lifeless favourite , Wotan turns a wrathful glance upon the treacherous Hunding , who , unable to endure the divine accusation of his unflinching gaze , falls lifeless to the ground . Then the god mounts his steed , and rides off on the wings of the storm in pursuit of the disobedient Walkyrie , whom he is obliged to punish severely for his oath 's sake . The next scene represents an elevated plateau , the trysting spot of the eight Walkyries , on Hindarfiall , or Walkuerenfels , whither they all come hastening , bearing the bodies of the slain across their fleet steeds . Brunhilde appears last of all , carrying Sieglinde . She breathlessly pours out the story of the day 's adventures , and implores her sisters to devise some means of hiding Sieglinde , and to protect her from Wotan 's dreaded wrath :  --  ' The raging hunter Behind me who rides , He nears , he nears from the North ! Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the tempest has been growing louder and louder while she is speaking , and as she ends her narrative Sieglinde recovers consciousness , but only to upbraid her for having saved her life . She wildly proposes suicide , until Brunhilde bids her live for the sake of Siegmund 's son whom she will bring into the world , and tells her to treasure the fragments of the sword Nothung , which she had carried away . Sieglinde , anxious now to live for her child 's sake , hides the broken fragments in her bosom , and , in obedience to Brunhilde 's advice , speeds into the dense forest where Fafnir has his lair , and where Wotan will never venture lest the curse of the ring should fall upon him . ' Save for thy son The broken sword ! Where his father fell On the field I found it . Who welds it anew And waves it again , His name he gains from me now  --  " Siegfried " the hero be hailed . ' The noise of the storm and rushing wind has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting Wotan 's approach . As Sieglinde vanishes in the dim recesses of the primeval forest , the wrathful god comes striding upon the stage in search of Brunhilde , who cowers tremblingly behind her sisters . After a scathing rebuke to the Walkyries , who would fain shelter a culprit from his all-seeing eye , Wotan bids Brunhilde step forth . Solemnly he then pronounces her sentence , declaring she shall serve him as Walkyrie no longer , but shall be banished to earth , where she will have to live as a mere mortal , and , marrying , to know naught beyond the joys and sorrows of other women :  --  ' Heard you not how Her fate I have fixed ? Far from your side Shall the faithless sister be sundered ; Her horse no more In your midst through the breezes shall haste her ; Her flower of maidenhood Will falter and fade ; A husband will win Her womanly heart , She meekly will bend To the mastering man The hearth she 'll heed , as she spins , And to laughers is left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which degrades her from the rank of a goddess to that of a mere mortal , sinks to her knees and utters a great cry of despair . This is echoed by the Walkyries , who , however , depart at Wotan 's command , leaving their unhappy sister alone with him . Passionately now Brunhilde pleads with her father , declaring she had meant to serve him best by disobeying his commands , and imploring him not to banish her forever from his beloved presence . But , although Wotan still loves her dearly , he can not revoke his decree , and repeats to her that he will leave her on the mountain , bound in the fetters of sleep , a prey to the first man who comes to awaken her and claim her as his bride . All Brunhilde 's tears and passionate pleadings only wring from him a promise that she will be hedged in by a barrier of living flames , so that none but the very bravest among men can ever come near her to claim her as his own . Wotan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently seals her eyes in slumber with tender kisses , lays her softly down upon the green mound , and draws down the visor of her helmet . Then , after covering her with her shield to protect her from all harm , he begins a powerful incantation , summoning Loge to surround her with an impassable barrier of flames . As this incantation proceeds , small flickering tongues of fire start forth on every side ; they soon rise higher and higher , roaring and crackling until , as Wotan disappears , they form a fiery barrier all around the sleeping Walkyrie :  --  ' Loge , hear ! Hitherward listen ! As I found thee at first  --  In arrowy flame As thereafter thou fleddest  --  In fluttering fire ; As I dealt with thee once , I wield thee to-day ! Arise , billowing blaze , And fold in thy fire the rock ! Loge ! Loge ! Aloft ! Who fears the spike Of my spear to face , He will pierce not the planted fire . ' Illustration : SIEGFRIED AND MIME . SIEGFRIED . Sieglinde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untrodden forest , dwelt there in utter solitude until the time came for her son Siegfried to come into the world . Sick and alone , the poor woman went about in search of aid , and finally came to Mime 's cavern , where , after giving birth to her child and intrusting him to the care of the dwarf , she gently breathed her last . Here , in the grand old forest , young Siegfried grew up to manhood , knowing nothing of his parentage except the lie which Mime , the wily dwarf , chose to tell him , that he was his own son . Strong , fearless , and unruly , the youth soon felt the utmost contempt for the cringing dwarf , and , instead of bending over the anvil and swinging the heavy hammer , he preferred to range the forest , hunting the wild beasts , climbing the tallest trees , and scaling the steepest rocks . As the opera opens , the curtain rises upon a sooty cave , where the dwarf Mime is alone at work , hammering a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence of young Siegfried , who shatters every weapon he makes . In spite of repeated disappointments , however , Mime the Nibelung works on . His sole aim is to weld a sword which in the bold youth 's hands will avail to slay his enemy , the giant Fafnir , the owner of the ring and magic helm , and the possessor of all the mighty hoard . While busy in his forge , Mime tells how the giant fled with his treasure far away from the haunts of men , concealed his gold in the Neidhole , a grewsome den . There , thanks to the magic helmet , he has assumed the loathsome shape of a great dragon , whose fiery breath and lashing tail none dares to encounter . As Mime finishes the sword he has been fashioning , Siegfried , singing his merry hunting song , dashes into the cave , holding a bear in leash . After some rough play , which nearly drives the unhappy Mime mad with terror , Siegfried sets the beast free , grasps the sword , and with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mime 's great chagrin . Another weapon has failed to satisfy his needs , and the youth , after harshly upbraiding the unhappy smith , throws himself sullenly down in front of the fire . Mime then cringingly approaches him with servile offers of food and drink , continually vaunting his love and devotion . These protests of simulated affection greatly disgust Siegfried , who is well aware of the fact that they are nothing but the merest pretence . In his anger against this constant deceit , he finally resorts to violence to wring the truth from Mime , who , with many interruptions and many attempts to resume his old whining tone , finally reveals to him the secret of his birth and the name of his mother . He also tells him all he gleaned about his father , who fell in battle , and , in proof of the veracity of his words , produces the fragments of Siegmund 's sword , which the dying Sieglinde had left for her son :  --  ' Lo ! what thy mother had left me ! For my pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See ! a broken sword , Brandished , she said , by thy father , When foiled in the last of his fights . ' Siegfried , who has listened to all this tale with breathless attention , interrupting the dwarf only to silence his recurring attempts at self-praise , now declares he will fare forth into the wild world as soon as Mime has welded together the precious fragments of the sword . In the mean while , finding the dwarf 's hated presence too unbearable , he rushes out and vanishes in the green forest depths . Left alone once more , Mime wistfully gazes after him , thinking how he may detain the youth until the dragon has been slain . At last he slowly begins to hammer the fragments of the sword , which will not yield to his skill and resume their former shape . While the dwarf Mime is abandoning himself to moody despair , Wotan has been walking through the forest . He is disguised as a Wanderer , according to his wont , and suddenly enters Mime 's cave . The dwarf starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after asking him who he may be , and learning that he prides himself upon his wisdom , he bids him begone . Wotan , however , who has come hither to ascertain whether there is any prospect of discovering anything new , now proposes a contest of wit , in which the loser 's head shall be at the winner 's disposal . Mime reluctantly assents , and begins by asking a question concerning the dwarfs and their treasures . This Wotan answers by describing the Nibelungs ' gold , and the power wielded by Alberich as long as he was owner of the magic ring . Mime 's second inquiry is relative to the inhabitants of earth , and Wotan describes the great stature of the giants , who , however , were no match for the dwarfs , until they obtained possession not only of the ring , but also of the great hoard over which Fafnir now broods in the guise of a dragon . Then Mime questions him concerning the gods , but only to be told that Wotan , the most powerful of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraved powerful runes . In speaking thus the disguised god strikes the ground with his spear , and a long roll of thunder falls upon the terrified Mime 's ear . The three questions have been asked and successfully answered , and it is now Mime 's turn to submit to an interrogatory , from which he evidently shrinks , but to which he must yield . Wotan now proceeds to ask him which race , beloved by Wotan , is yet visited by his wrath , which sword is the most invincible of weapons , and who will weld its broken pieces together . Mime triumphantly answers the first two questions by naming the Volsung race and Siegmund 's blade , Nothung ; but as he has failed to weld the sword anew , and has no idea who will be able to achieve the feat , he is forced to acknowledge himself beaten by the third . Scorning to take any advantage of so puny a rival , Wotan refuses to take the forfeited head , and departs , after telling the Nibelung that the sword can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who knows no fear , and that the same man will claim it as his lawful prize and dispose of Mime 's head :  --  ' Hark thou forfeited dwarf ; None but he Who never feared , Nothung forges anew . Henceforth beware ! Thy wily head Is forfeit to him Whose heart is free from fear . ' When Siegfried returns and finds the fire low , the dwarf idle , and the sword unfinished , he angrily demands an explanation . Mime then reveals to him that none but a fearless man can ever accomplish the task . As Siegfried does not even know the meaning of the word , Mime graphically describes all the various phases of terror to enlighten him . Siegfried listens to his explanations , but when they have come to an end and he has ascertained that such a feeling has never been harboured in his breast , he springs up and seizes the pieces of the broken sword . He files them to dust , melts the metal on the fire , which he blows into an intense glow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaily sings the Song of the Sword . The blade , when finished , flashes in his hand like a streak of lightning , and possesses so keen an edge that he cleaves the huge anvil in two with a single stroke . While Siegfried is thus busily employed , Mime , dreading the man who knows no fear , and to whom he has been told his head was forfeit , concocts a poisonous draught . This he intends to administer to the young hero as soon as the frightful dragon is slain , for he has artfully incited the youth to go forth and attack the monster , in hope of learning the peculiar sensation of fear , which he has never yet known . In another cave , in the depths of the selfsame dense forest , is Alberich the dwarf , Mime 's brother and former master . He mounts guard night and day over the Neidhole , where Fafnir , the giant dragon , gloats over his gold . It is night and the darkness is so great that the entrance to the Neidhole only dimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , rustling all the forest leaves . It subsides however almost as soon as it has risen , and Wotan , still disguised as a Wanderer , appears in the moonlight , to the great alarm of the wily dwarf . A moment 's examination suffices to enable him to recognise his quondam foe , whom he maliciously taunts with the loss of the ring , for well he knows the god can not take back what he has once given away . Wotan , however , seems in no wise inclined to resent this taunting speech , but warns Alberich of the approach of Mime , accompanied by a youth who knows no fear , and whose keen blade will slay the monster . He adds that the youth will appropriate the hoard , ere he rouses Fafnir to foretell the enemy 's coming . Then he disappears with the usual accompaniment of rushing winds and rumbling thunder . The warning which Alberich would fain disbelieve is verified , as soon as the morning breaks , by the appearance of Siegfried and Mime . The latter is acting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lair . But even then the youth still refuses to tremble , and when Mime describes Fafnir 's fiery breath , coiling tail , and impenetrable hide , he good-naturedly declares he will save his most telling blow until the monster 's side is exposed , and he can plunge Nothung deep into his gigantic breast . Thus forewarned against the dragon 's various modes of attack , Siegfried advances boldly , while Mime prudently retires to a place of safety . He is closely watched by Alberich , who crouches unseen in his cave . Siegfried seats himself on the bank to wait for the dragon 's awakening , and beguiles the time by trying to imitate the songs of the birds , which he would fain understand quite clearly . As all his efforts result in failure , Siegfried soon casts aside the reed with which he had tried to reproduce their liquid notes , and , winding his horn , boldly summons Fafnir to come forth and encounter him in single fight . This challenge immediately brings forth the frightful dragon . To Siegfried 's surprise he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual amenities , the fight begins . Mindful of his boast , Siegfried skilfully parries every blow , evades the fiery breath , lashing tail , and dangerous claws , and , biding his time , thrusts his sword up to the very hilt in the giant 's heart . With his dying breath , the monster tells the youth of the curse which accompanies his hoard , and , rolling over , dies in terrible convulsions . The young hero , seeing the monster is dead , withdraws his sword from the wound ; but as he does so a drop of the fiery blood falls upon his naked hand . The intolerable smarting sensation it produces causes him to put it to his lips to allay the pain . No sooner has he done so than he suddenly becomes aware that a miracle has happened , for he can understand the songs of all the forest birds . Listening wonderingly , Siegfried soon hears a bird overhead warning him to possess himself of the tarn-helmet and magic ring , and proclaiming that the treasure of the Nibelungs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its advice , and vanishes into the gaping Neidhole in search of the promised treasures :  --  ' Hi ! Siegfried shall have now The Nibelungs ' hoard , For here in the hole It awaits his hand ! Let him not turn from the tarn-helm , It leads to tasks of delight ; But finds he a ring for his finger , The world he will rule with his will . ' Alberich and Mime , who have been trembling with fear as long as the conflict raged , now timidly venture out of their respective hiding places . Then only they become aware of each other 's intention to hasten into the cave and appropriate the treasure , and begin a violent quarrel . It is brought to a speedy close , however , by the reappearance of Siegfried wearing the glittering helmet , armour , and magic ring . The mere appearance of this martial young figure causes both dwarfs to slink back to their hiding places , while the birds resume their song . They warn Siegfried to distrust Mime , who is even then approaching with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such persistency that Siegfried , disgusted with his fawning hypocrisy , finally draws his sword and kills him with one blow :  --  ' Taste of my sword , Sickening talker ! Meed for hate Nothung makes ; Work for which he was mended . ' Then , while Alberich is laughing in malicious glee over the downfall of his rival , Siegfried flings his body into the Neidhole , and rolls the dragon 's carcass in front of the opening to protect the gold . He next pauses again to listen to the bird in the lime tree , which sings of a lovely maiden surrounded by flames , who can be won as bride only by the man who knows no fear :  --  ' Ha ! Siegfried has slain The slanderous dwarf . O , would that the fairest Wife he might find ! On lofty heights she sleeps , A fire embraces her hall ; If he strides through the blaze , And wakens the bride , Brunhilde he wins to wife . ' This new quest sounds so alluring to Siegfried , that he immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanderer has previously taken . The latter has gone on to the very foot of the mountain , upon which the flickering flames which surrounded Brunhilde are burning brightly . There he pauses to conjure the goddess Erda to appear and reveal future events . Slowly and reluctantly the Earth goddess arises from her prolonged sleep . Her face is pallid as the newly fallen snow , her head crowned with glittering icicles , and her form enveloped in a great white winding-sheet . In answer to the god 's inquiries about the future , she bids him question the Norns and Brunhilde . After a few obscure prophecies he allows her to sink down into her grave once more , for he now knows that one of the Volsung race has won the magic ring , and is even now on his way up the mountain to awaken Brunhilde . In corroboration of these words , Siegfried appears a few moments after the prophetess or Wala has again sunk into rest . Challenged by Wotan the Wanderer , he declares he is on the way to rouse the sleeping maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds that he has slain Mime and the dragon , has tasted its blood , and brandishes aloft the glittering sword which has done him good service and which he has welded himself . Wotan , wishing to test his courage , and at the same time to fulfil his promise to Brunhilde that none should attempt to pass the flames except the one who feared not even his magic spear , now declares that he has slain his father , Siegmund . Siegfried , the avenger , boldly draws his gleaming sword , which , instead of shattering as once before against the divine spear , cuts it to pieces . In the same instant the Wanderer disappears , amid thunder and lightning . Siegfried , looking about him to find Brunhilde , becomes aware of the flickering flames of a great fire , which rise higher and higher as he rushes joyfully into their very midst , blowing his horn and singing his merry hunting lay . The flames , which now invade the whole stage , soon flicker and die out , and , as the scene becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grassy mound . Siegfried comes , and , after commenting upon the drowsing steed , draws nearer still . Then he perceives the sleeping figure in armour , and bends solicitously over it . Gently he removes the shield and helmet , cuts open the armour , and starts back in surprise when he sees a flood of bright golden hair fall rippling all around the fair form of a sleeping woman :  --  ' No man it is ! Hallowed rapture Thrills through my heart ; Fiery anguish Enfolds my eyes . My senses wander And waver . Whom shall I summon Hither to help me ? Mother ! Mother ! Be mindful of me . ' His head suddenly sinks down upon her bosom , but , as her immobility continues , he experiences for the first time a faint sensation of fear . This is born of his love for her , and , in a frantic endeavour to recall her to life , he bends down and kisses her passionately . At the magic touch of his lips , Brunhilde opens her eyes , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a burst of rapturous song ere she turns to thank her deliverer . The first glimpse of the hero in his glittering mail is enough to fill her heart with love , and recognizing in him Siegfried , the hero whose coming she herself has foretold , she welcomes him with joy . Siegfried then relates how he found her , how he delivered her from the fetters of sleep , and , impetuously declaring his passion , claims her love in return . The scene between the young lovers , the personifications of the Sun and of Spring , is one of indescribable passion and beauty , and when they have joined in a duet of unalterable love , Brunhilde no longer regrets past glories , but declares the world well lost for the love she has won . ' Away Walhall 's Lightening world ! In dust with thy seeming , Towers lie down ! Farewell greatness And gift of the gods ! End in bliss Thou unwithering breed ! You , Norns , unravel The rope of runes ! Darken upwards Dusk of the gods ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stand in sight Of Siegfried 's star ; For me he was And for me he will be , Ever and always , One and all Lighting love And laughing death . ' These sentiments are more than echoed by the enamoured Siegfried , who is beside himself with rapture at the mere thought of possessing the glorious creature , who has forgotten all her divine state to become naught but a loving and lovable woman . Illustration : SIEGFRIED AND THE RHINE MAIDENS . DUSK OF THE GODS . The Norns , or Northern goddesses of fate , are seen in the dim light before dawn , busily weaving the web of destiny on the rocky hillside where the Walkyries formerly held their tryst . As they twist their rope , which is stretched from north to south , they sing of the age of gold . Then they sat beneath the great world-ash , near the limpid well , where Wotan had left an eye in pledge to win a daily draught of wisdom . They also sing how the god tore from the mighty ash a limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of the tree , which withered and died in spite of all their care . The third Norn then continues the tale her sisters have begun , and tells how Wotan came home with a shivered spear one day , and bade the gods cut down the tree . Its limbs were piled like fuel all around Walhalla , the castle which the giants had built , and since then Wotan has sat there in moody silence , awaiting the predicted end , which can no longer be far distant . While they are singing , the barrier of flame in the background burns brightly , and its light grows pale only as dawn breaks slowly over the scene . The rope which the Norns are weaving then suddenly parts beneath their fingers ; so they bind the fragments about them and sink slowly into the ground , to join their mother Erda , wailing a prophecy concerning the end of the old heathen world :  --  ' Away now is our knowledge ! The world meets From wisdom no more ; Below to Mother , below ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siegfried and Brunhilde come out of the cave . The former is in full armour and bears a jewelled shield , the latter leads her horse , Grane , by the bridle . Tenderly Brunhilde bids her lover farewell , telling him that she will not restrain his ardour , for she knows it is a hero 's part to journey out into the world and perform the noble tasks which await him . But her strength and martial fury have entirely departed since she has learned to love , and she repeatedly adjures him not to forget her , promising to await his homecoming behind her flickering barrier of flame , and to think constantly of him while he is away . Siegfried reminds her that she need not fear he will forget her as long as she wears the Nibelung ring , the seal of their troth , and gladly accepts from her in exchange the steed Grane . Although it can no longer scurry along the paths of air , this horse is afraid of nothing , and is ready to rush through water and fire at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steed , Brunhilde watches him out of sight , and it is only when the last echoes of his hunting horn die away in the distance that the curtain falls . The next scene is played at Worms on the Rhine . Gunther and his sister Gutrune are sitting in their ancestral hall , with their half-brother Hagen . He is the son of Alberich , and has been begotten with the sole hope that he will once help his father to recover the Nibelung ring . Hagen advises Gunther to remember the duty he owes his race , and to marry as soon as possible , and recommends as suitable mate the fair Brunhilde , who is fenced in by a huge barrier of living flame . Gunther is not at all averse to matrimony , and is anxious to secure the peerless bride proposed , yet he knows he can never pass through the flames , and asks how Brunhilde is to be won . Hagen , who as a Nibelung knows the future , foretells that Siegfried , the dauntless hero , will soon be there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory all recollection of past love by means of a magic potion , they can soon induce him to promise his aid in exchange for the hand of Gutrune . As he speaks , the sound of a horn is heard , and Hagen , looking out , sees Siegfried crossing the river in a boat , and goes down to the landing with Gunther to bid the hero welcome . Hagen leads the horse away , but soon returns , while Gunther ushers Siegfried into the hall of the Gibichungs , and enters into conversation with him . As Siegfried 's curiosity has been roused by the strangers calling him by name , he soon inquires how they knew him , and Hagen declares that the mere sight of the tarn-cap had been enough . He then reveals to Siegfried its magical properties , and asks him what he has done with the hoard , and especially with the ring , which he vainly seeks on his hand . Siegfried carelessly replies that the gold is still in the Neidhole , guarded by the body of the dragon , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he finishes this statement , Gutrune timidly draws near , and offers him a drinking horn , the draught of welcome , in which , however , the magic potion of forgetfulness has been mixed . Siegfried drains it eagerly , remarking to himself that he drinks to Brunhilde alone . But no sooner has he partaken of it than her memory leaves him , and he finds himself gazing admiringly upon Gutrune . Gunther then proceeds to tell Siegfried the story of Brunhilde , whom he would fain woo to wife . Although the hero dreamily repeats his words , and seems to be struggling hard to recall some past memory , he does not succeed in doing so . Finally he shakes off his abstraction , and ardently proposes to pass through the fire and win Brunhilde for Gunther in exchange for Gutrune 's hand :  --  ' Me frights not her fire ; I 'll woo for thee the maid ; For with might and mind Am I thy man  --  A wife in Gutrun ' to win . ' The two heroes now decide upon swearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath ,  --  and , charging Hagen to guard the hall of the Gibichungs , they immediately sally forth on their quest . Brunhilde , in the mean while , has remained on the Walkuerenfels anxiously watching for Siegfried 's return , and spending long hours in contemplating the magic ring , her lover husband 's last gift . Her solitude is , however , soon invaded by Waltraute , one of her sister Walkyries . She informs her that Wotan has been plunged in melancholy thought ever since he returned home from his wanderings with a shattered spear , and bade the gods pile the wood of the withered world-ash all around Walhalla . This he has decided shall be his funeral pyre , when the predicted doom of the gods overtakes him . Waltraute adds also that she alone has found the clue to his sorrow , for she has overheard him mutter that , if the ring were given back to the Rhine-daughters , the curse spoken by Alberich would be annulled , and the gods could yet be saved from their doom :  --  ' The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will the curse 's weight Be cast from the god and the world . ' Brunhilde pays but indifferent attention to all this account , and it is only when Waltraute informs her that it is in her power to avert the gods ' doom by restoring the ring she wears to the mourning Rhine-daughters , that she starts angrily from her abstraction , swearing she will never part with Siegfried 's gift , the emblem and seal of their plighted troth . Waltraute , seeing no prayers will avail to win the ring , then rides sadly away , while the twilight gradually settles down , and the barrier of flames burns on with a redder glow . At the sound of a hunting horn , Brunhilde rushes joyously to the back of the scene , with a rapturous cry of ' Siegfried ! ' but shrinks suddenly back in fear and dismay when , instead of the bright beloved form , a dark man appears through the flickering flames . It is Siegfried , who , by virtue of the tarn-helmet , has assumed Gunther 's form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reward for having made his way through the barrier of fire . Brunhilde indignantly refuses to recognize him as her master . Passionately kissing her ring , she loudly declares that as long as it graces her finger she will have the strength to repulse every attack and keep her troth to the giver . This declaration so incenses Siegfried  --  who , owing to the magic potion , has entirely forgotten her and her love  --  that he rushes towards her , and after a violent struggle wrenches the ring from her finger , and places it upon his own . Cowed by the violence of this rude wooer , and deprived of her ring , Brunhilde no longer resists , but tacitly yields when he claims her as wife , and both soon disappear in the cave . There Siegfried , mindful of his oath to marry her by proxy only , lays his unsheathed sword between him and his friend 's bride :  --  ' Now , Nothung , witness well That faithfully I wooed ; Lest I wane in truth to my brother , Bar me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Worms to guard the hall of the Gibichungs , is favored in his sleep by a visit from his father , Alberich . The dwarf informs him that ever since the gods touched the fatal ring their power has waned , and that he must do all in his power to recover it from Siegfried , who again holds it , and who little suspects its magic power . As Alberich disappears , carrying with him Hagen 's promise to do all he can , the latter awakens just in time to welcome the returning Siegfried . The young hero joyfully announces the success of their expedition , and rapturously claims Gutrune as his bride . After hearing her lover 's account of his night 's adventures , the maiden leads him into the hall in search of rest and refreshment , while Hagen , summoning the people with repeated blasts of his horn , admonishes them to deck the altars of Wotan , Freya , and Donner , and to prepare to receive their master and mistress with every demonstration of joy . The festive preparations are barely completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale and reluctant , and advances with downcast eyes , which she raises only when she stands opposite Gutrune and Siegfried , and hears the latter 's name . Dropping Gunther 's hand , she rushes forward impetuously to throw herself in Siegfried 's arms , but , arrested by his cold unrecognising glance , she tremblingly inquires how he came there , and why he stands by Gutrune 's side ? Calmly then Siegfried announces his coming marriage :  --  ' Gunther 's winsome sister She that I wed As Gunther thee . ' Brunhilde indignantly denies her marriage to Gunther , and almost swoons , but Siegfried supports her , and , although Brunhilde softly and passionately asks him if he does not know her , the young hero indifferently hands her over to Gunther , bidding him look after his wife . At a motion of his hand , Brunhilde 's attention is attracted to the ring , and she angrily demands how he dare wear the token which Gunther wrested from her hand . Bewildered by this question , Siegfried denies ever having received the ring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Neidhole ; but Hagen , anxious to stir up strife , interferes , and elicits from Brunhilde an assurance that the hero can have won the ring only by guile . A misunderstanding now ensues , for while Brunhilde in speaking refers to their first meeting , and swears that Siegfried had wooed and treated her as his wife , he , recollecting only the second encounter , during which he acted only as Gunther 's proxy , denies her assertions . Both solemnly swear to the truth of their statement upon Hagen 's spear , calling the vengeance of Heaven down upon them in case of perjury . Then the interrupted wedding festivities are resumed , for Gunther knows only too well by what fraud his bride was obtained , and thinks the transformation has not been complete enough to blind the wise Brunhilde . As Siegfried gently leads Gutrune away into the hall , whither all but Hagen , Gunther , and Brunhilde follow him , the latter gives way to her extravagant grief . Hagen approaches her , offering to avenge all her wrongs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wipe away the foul stain upon her honour . But Brunhilde tells him it is quite useless to challenge the hero , for she herself had made him invulnerable to every blow by blessing every part of his body except his back . This she deemed useless to protect , as Siegfried , the bravest of men , never fled from any foe :  --  ' HAGEN . So wounds him nowhere a weapon ? BRUNHILDE . In battle none :  --  but still Bare to the stroke is his back Never  --  I felt  --  In flight he would find A foe to be harmful behind him , So spared I his back from the blessing . ' Her resentment against Siegfried has reached such a pitch , however , that she finally hails with fierce joy Hagen 's proposal to slay him in the forest on the morrow . Even Gunther acquiesces in this crime , which will leave his sister a widow , and they soon agree that it shall be explained to Gutrune as a hunting casualty . At noon on the next day Siegfried arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quarry which has escaped him . The Rhine daughters , who concealed it purposely in hopes of recovering their ring , rise up out of the water , and swimming gracefully around promise to help him recover his game if he will only give them his ring . Siegfried , who attaches no value whatever to the trinket , but wishes to tease them , refuses it at first ; but when they change their bantering into a prophetic tone and try to frighten him by telling him the ring will prove his bane unless he intrust it to their care , he proudly answers that he has never yet learned to fear , and declares he will keep it , and see whether their prediction will be fulfilled :  --  ' My sword once splintered a spear ;  --  The endless coil Of counsel of old , Wove they with wasting Curses its web ; Norns shall not cover from Nothung ! One warned me beware Of the curse a Worm ; But he failed to make me to fear ,  --  The World 's riches I won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd leave ; I 'll yield it for sweetness to you ; But for safety of limbs and of life ,  --  Were it not worth Of a finger 's weight ,  --  No ring from me you will reach ! ' The Rhine maidens then bid him farewell , and swim away repeating their ominous prophecy . After they have gone , the hunting party appear , heralded by the merry music of their horns . All sit down to partake of the refreshments that have been brought , and as Siegfried has provided no game , he tries to do his share by entertaining them with tales of his early youth . After telling them of his childhood spent in Mime 's forge , of the welding of Nothung and the slaying of Fafnir , he describes how a mere taste of the dragon 's blood enabled him to understand the songs of the birds . Encouraged by Hagen , he next relates the capture of the tarn-helm and ring , and then , draining his horn in which Hagen has secretly poured an antidote to the draught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quest of the sleeping Walkyrie and his first meeting with Brunhilde . At the mere mention of her name , all the past returns to his mind . He suddenly remembers all her beauty and love , and starts wildly to his feet , but only to be pierced by the spear of the treacherous Hagen , who had stolen behind him to drive it into his heart . The dying hero makes one last vain effort to avenge himself , then sinks feebly to the earth , while Hagen slips away , declaring that the perjurer had fully deserved to be slain by the weapon upon which he had sworn his false oath . Gunther , sorry now that it is too late , bends sadly over the prostrate hero , who , released from the fatal effects of Gutrune 's draught , speaks once more of his beloved Brunhilde , and fancies he is once more clasped in her arms as of old . Then , when he has breathed his last , the hunters place his body upon a shield and bear it away in the rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funeral march , whose muffled notes fall like a knell on the listener 's ear . Gutrune , who has found the day very long indeed without her beloved Siegfried , comes out of her room at nightfall , and listens intently for the sound of the hunting horn which will proclaim his welcome return . She is not the only watcher , however , for Brunhilde has stolen down to the river , and her apartment is quite empty . Suddenly Hagen comes in , and Gutrune , terrified at his unexpected appearance , anxiously inquires why she has not heard her husband 's horn . Without any preparation , roughly , brutally , Hagen informs her the hero is dead , just as the bearers enter and deposit his lifeless body at her feet . Gutrune faints , but when she recovers consciousness she indignantly refuses to credit Hagen 's story , that her husband was slain by a boar . She wildly accuses Gunther , who frees himself from suspicion by denouncing Hagen . Without showing the least sign of remorse , the dark son of Alberich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about to appropriate the fatal ring , draws his sword and slays him also . Wildly now Hagen snatches at the ring , that long coveted treasure ; but he starts back in dismay without having secured it , for the dead hand is threateningly raised , to the horror of all the spectators . Next Brunhilde comes upon the scene , singing a song of vengeance ; and when Gutrune wildly accuses her of being the cause of her husband 's murder , she declares that she alone was Siegfried 's lawful wife , and that he would always have been true to her had not Gutrune won him by the ruse of a magic draught . Sadly Gutrune acknowledges the truth of this statement , and , feeling that she has no right to mourn over the husband of another woman , she creeps over to Gunther 's corpse and bends motionless over him . Brunhilde 's anger is all forgotten now that the hero is dead , and , after caressing him tenderly for a while , she directs the bystanders to erect a huge funeral pyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dirge , and draws the ring unhindered from his dead hand . Then she announces her decision to perish in the flames beside him , and declares the Rhine maidens can come and reclaim their stolen treasure from their mingled ashes :  --  ' Thou guilty ring ! Running gold ! My hand gathers , And gives thee again . You wisely seeing Water sisters , The Rhine 's unresting daughters , I deem your word was of weight ! All that you ask Now is your own ; Here from my ashes ' Heap you may have it !  --  The flame as it clasps me round Free from the curse of the ring !  --  Back to its gold Unbind it again , And far in the flood Withhold its fire , The Rhine 's unslumbering sun , That for harm from him was reft . ' The curse of the ring is at an end . The ravens of Wotan , perching aloft , fly heavily off to announce the tidings in Walhalla , while Brunhilde , after seeing Siegfried 's body carefully deposited on the pyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hand . Then , springing upon Grane , she rides into the very midst of the flames , which soon rise so high that they swallow her up and entirely hide her from the spectators ' sight . After a short time the flames die down , the bright light fades , the stage darkens , and the river rises and overflows its banks , until its waves come dashing over the funeral pyre . They bear upon their swelling crests the Rhine maidens who have come to recover their ring , Hagen , standing gloomily in the background , becomes suddenly aware of their intention , wildly flings his weapons aside , and rushes forward , crying , ' Unhand the ring ! ' But he is caught in the twining arms of two of the Rhine maidens , who draw him down under the water , and drown him , while the third , having secured the Nibelung ring , returns in triumph on the ebbing waves to her native depths , chanting the Rhinegold strain . As she disappears , a reddish glow like the Aurora Borealis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until one can discern the shining abode of Walhalla , enveloped in lurid flames from the burning world-ash , and in the centre the assembled gods calmly seated upon their thrones , to submit to their long predicted doom , the ' Goetterdaemmerung. ' 3 3 See Prof. G.T. Dippold 's ' Ring of the Nibelung . ' Illustration : PARSIFAL IN THE ENCHANTED GARDEN . PARSIFAL . It was while he was searching for the material for Tannhaeuser , that Wagner came across Wolfram von Eschenbach 's poems of ' Parsifal ' and ' Titurel , ' 4 and , as he reports , ' an entirely new world of poetical matter suddenly opened before me . ' Wagner made no use of this idea , however , until 1857 , some fifteen years later , when he drew up the first sketch of his Parsifal , during his residence at Zurich ; twenty years later he finished the poem at Bayreuth . He then immediately began the music , although he was sixty-five years of age . That same year , while he was making a concert tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience of friends , by whose advice it was published . Although the music for this opera , which is designated as ' a solemn work destined to hallow the stage , ' was finished in 1879 , the instrumentation was completed only in 1882 , at Palermo , a few months before its first production at Bayreuth . This opera , which Wagner himself called a religious drama , is intended as the ' Song of Songs of Divine Love , as Tristan and Ysolde is the Song of Songs of Terrestrial Love . ' The performance was repeated sixteen times at Bayreuth , where many people had come from all parts of the world to hear and see it , and has since been revived a number of times . It is the most difficult and least easily understood of the master 's intricate works , and bears the imprint not only of his philosophical studies , but also of the spirit of Oriental mysticism , in which he delighted , and which he at one time intended to make use of for the stage . The opera opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Amfortas , guardian of the Holy Grail , is lying asleep with two squires . Suddenly , reveille sounds from the top of Mount Salvat , the sacred hill upon which the temple stands . Gurnemanz , springing to his feet , rouses the squires , and bids them prepare the bath for their ailing master , who will soon appear as is his daily custom . This Amfortas , whose coming they momentarily expect , is the son of Titurel , the founder of the temple erected on Mount Salvat for the reception of the Holy Grail , a vessel in which Joseph of Arimathea caught a few drops of blood from the dying Redeemer 's side , after it had served as chalice during the Last Supper . Titurel , feeling too old to continue his office as guardian of the Grail , appointed Amfortas as his successor , giving him the sacred lance which pierced the Saviour 's side , and told him that none could resist him as long as he wielded it and kept himself perfectly pure . During many years Amfortas led a stainless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing all his sacred offices with exemplary piety , and teaching the Knights of the Grail to fight for the right , and rescue the feeble and oppressed . He also sent out messengers to all parts of the world to right the wrong , whenever called upon to do so , by the words which suddenly appeared and glowed like fire around the edge of the mystic vase . All the knights who served the Holy Grail were not only fed with celestial viands by its power alone , but were endowed with resistless might , which assured their victory everywhere as long as they remained unknown . They had moreover the privilege of recovering , as if by magic , from every wound . Of course , many knights were desirous of being admitted into the temple , but none except those whose lives were pure and whose purposes lofty were ever accepted . When Klingsor , the magician , attempted to enter , therefore , he was repulsed . In his anger he established himself upon the other side of the mountain , where , summoning all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusions of every kind . Thus he beguiled many of the knights in search of the Holy Grail , caught them in his toils and led them on to sin , until they were unfit for the holy life to which they had once aspired . Amfortas , hearing of this , and too confident in his own strength , sallied forth one day , armed with the sacred lance , determined to destroy Klingsor , and put an end to his magic . But alas ! he had no sooner entered the magician 's garden , where roamed a host of lovely maidens trained to lure all men to sin , than he yielded to the blandishments of the fairest among them . Carelessly flinging his sacred lance aside , he gave himself up to the delights of passion . Such was his bewitched condition that he never even noticed the stealthy approach of the magician , who seized the lance and thrust it into his side . This deep wound , which had refused to heal ever since , caused him incessant tortures , which were increased rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy could allay this torture , the Holy Grail decreed that it should be stilled by a guileless fool , who , enlightened by pity , would find the only cure . But , as he tarried , many knights travelled all over the world in search of simples , and Kundry , a wild , witch-like woman , also sought in vain to relieve him . While the squires , in obedience to Gurnemanz 's orders , prepare the bath , Kundry comes riding wildly on the scene . In breathless haste she thrusts a curious little flask into Gurnemanz 's hand , telling him it is a precious balsam she has brought from a great distance to alleviate Amfortas 's suffering . She is so exhausted by her long ride that she flings herself upon the ground , where she remains while a little procession comes down the hill . It is composed of knights bearing the wounded Amfortas , and they set the litter down for a moment , as the king gives vent to heart-rending groans . To soothe him , his attendants remind him that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , failing all others , they can always rely upon the promise of the Holy Grail , and await the coming of the guileless fool . When Amfortas learns that Kundry has made another attempt to help him , he thanks her kindly , but his gentle words only seem to increase her distress , for she writhes uneasily on the ground and refuses all thanks . When the king and his bearers have gone down the hill , and have passed out of sight , the squires begin chaffing poor Kundry . She gazes upon them with the wild eyes of an animal at bay , until Gurnemanz comes to her rescue , and chides the youths . He tells them that although she may once have been , as they declare , under a curse , she has repented of her sins , and serves the Holy Grail with a humility and singleness of purpose which they would do well to imitate rather than deride . In answer to their questions , he then goes on to describe how Amfortas received the grievous wound which causes him such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only enhances Klingsor 's power for evil , and which none but a stainless knight can ever recover . Their quiet conversation is brusquely interrupted by the heavy fall of a swan , which lies dead at their feet . This arouses their keenest indignation , for the rules of the order forbid any deed of violence within sight or hearing of the sacred edifice containing the Holy Grail . Gazing around in search of the culprit , they soon behold the youth Parsifal , clad in the rough and motley garments of a fool , and when Gurnemanz angrily reproves him , and questions him concerning his name and origin , he is amazed by the ignorance the lad displays . By the help of Kundry , however , who , having travelled everywhere , knows everything , Gurnemanz finally ascertains that the youth is a descendant of the royal family , his father , Gamuret , having died when he was born . His mother , Herzeloide ( Heart 's Affliction ) , has brought him up in utter solitude and ignorance , to prevent his becoming a knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Bereft of father his mother bore him . For in battle perished Gamuret : From like untimely hero 's death To save her offspring , strange to arms She reared him a witless fool in deserts . ' The youth , however , pays no heed to Kundry 's explanations , but goes on to tell Gurnemanz that he saw some men riding through the forest in glittering array , and followed them through the world with no other weapon than the bow he had manufactured . But when Kundry again interrupts him , declaring that his sudden disappearance has caused his mother 's death , he shows the greatest sensibility , and even faints with grief . While the squires gently bathe his face and hands to bring him back to life , Kundry , feeling the sudden and overpowering desire for sleep which often mysteriously overpowers her , creeps reluctantly into a neighbouring thicket , where she immediately sinks into a comatose state . In the mean while , the king 's procession comes up from the bath , and slowly passes across the stage and up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden hope that the youth before him may be the promised guileless fool who alone can cure the king , puts an arm around him , gently raises him , and , supporting his feeble footsteps , leads him up the hill . They walk along dark passages , and finally come into the great hall on the top of Mount Salvat , which is empty now , and where only the sound of the bells in the dome is heard as Gurnemanz says to Parsifal :  --  ' Now give good heed , and let me see , If thou ' rt a Fool and pure What wisdom thou presently canst secure . ' Parsifal , the unsophisticated youth , stands spellbound at the marvels he beholds , nor does he move when the great doors open , and the Knights of the Grail come marching in , singing of the mystic vessel and of its magic properties . This strain is taken up not only by the youths who follow them , but also by a boy choir in the dome which is intended to represent the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors open again to admit the bearers of the sacred vessel , which is kept in a shrine . They are followed by Amfortas , in his litter , and when he has been carefully laid upon a couch , and the vessel has been placed upon the altar before him , all bow down in silent prayer . Suddenly the silence is broken by the voice of the aged Titurel . He is lying in a niche in the rear of the hall , and calls solemnly upon his son to uncover the Holy Grail , and give him a sight of the glorious vessel , which alone can renew his failing strength . The boys are about to remove the veil when Amfortas suddenly detains them , and begins a passionate protest , relating how his sufferings increase every time he beholds the Grail . He implores his father to resume the sacred office , and wildly asks how long his sufferings must endure . To this appeal the angels ' voices respond by repeating the prophecy made by the Holy Grail :  --  ' By pity ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool . ' Strengthened by this reminder of ultimate relief , and by the voice of the knights and of Titurel again calling for the uncovering of the Grail , Amfortas takes the crystal cup from its shrine , bends over it in devout prayer , while the angel voices above chant a sort of communion service , and the hall is gradually darkened . Suddenly a beam of blinding light shoots down through the dome and falls upon the cup , which ' glows with an increased purple lustre , ' while Amfortas holds it above his head , and gently waves it to and fro , so that its mystic light can be seen by all the knights and squires , who have sunk to their knees . Titurel hails the sight with a pious ejaculation , and when Amfortas has replaced the vessel in the shrine the beam of light disappears , daylight again fills the hall , and knights and squires begin to partake of the bread and wine before them , a feast to which Gurnemanz invites the amazed Parsifal by a mute gesture . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the invisible choir resume their chant , which is taken up first by the youths ' voices , and then by the knights , and ends only as the meal draws to a close , and Amfortas is borne out , preceded by the Holy Grail and followed by the long train of knights and squires . Gurnemanz and Parsifal alone remain . The Fool , though guileless , has not been enlightened by pity to inquire the cause of Amfortas 's wound . He has thus missed his opportunity to cure him , and Gurnemanz , indignant at his boundless stupidity , opens a side door , and thrusts him out into the forest , uttering a contemptuous dismissal . ' Thou art then nothing but a Fool ! Come away , on thy road be gone And put my rede to use : Leave all our swans for the future alone And seek thyself , gander , a goose . ' The second act represents the inner keep of Klingsor 's castle , the magician himself being seated on the battlement . He is gazing intently into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , and comments with malicious glee upon Parsifal 's ejection from the temple of the Holy Grail and his approach to his enchanted ground . Laying aside his magic mirror , Klingsor then begins one of his uncanny spells , and in the midst of a bluish vapor calls up Kundry from the enchanted sleep into which his art has bound her . He tells her that , although she has succeeded in escaping his power for a short time , and has gone over to the enemy whom she has done all in her power to serve , he now requires her to exercise all her fascinations to beguile Parsifal away from the path of virtue , as she once lured Amfortas , the king and guardian of the Holy Grail . In vain the half awakened Kundry struggles and tries to resist his power , Klingsor has her again in his toils , and once more compels her , much against her wishes , to execute his will . Just as Parsifal , overcoming all resistance , drives away the guards of the castle and springs up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his tower sink from view , and a beautiful garden appears , in which lovely damsels flit excitedly about in very scanty attire . After a few moments spent in motionless admiration of the scene before him , Parsifal springs down into the garden , where he is immediately surrounded by the fair nymphs . They pull him this way and that , tease and cajole him , and use all their wiles to attract his attention and win his admiration . Seeing him very indifferent to their unadorned charms , a few of them hastily retire into a bower , where they don gay flower costumes , in which they soon appear before him , winding in and out in the gay mazes of the dance . Their youthful companions immediately follow their example , and also try to beguile Parsifal by their flower hues , their kisses and caresses , but he stands stolidly by until Kundry , who is now no longer a terrible and haggard witch , but a fair enchantress reclining upon a bed of roses , calls him to her side . As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower nymphs flit away to their respective bowers . Wonderingly he now inquires how Kundry knows his name , and again hears her relate how she was present at his birth , watched over his childhood , and witnessed the death of his mother . At this mention the youth is again overcome with grief . To comfort him , Kundry , the enchantress , tenderly embraces him , and lavishes soft words upon him , but all her caresses have no effect , except to awaken in his heart a sudden miraculous comprehension of all he has seen . Love is suddenly born in his heart , but it is not the evil passion which Kundry had striven to bring to life , but the pure , unselfish feeling which enables one human being to understand and sympathise with another . He now knows that Amfortas yielded to passion 's spell , and in punishment suffered the spear wound in his side , and realizes that he alone could have given him relief . Moved to sudden indignation by his compassion , he flings Kundry 's caressing arms aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption , if she will only tell him how to save Amfortas , and will reveal who wielded the spear which dealt the fatal wound . But Kundry , who is acting now entirely under Klingsor 's influence , and not by her own volition , seeing she can not lure him to sin , and that he is about to escape forever , shrieks frantically for help , cursing him vehemently , and declaring that he will have to wander long ere he can again find a way to the realm of the Holy Grail . Her piercing screams bring the flower damsels and Klingsor upon the scene , and the latter , standing upon the rampart , flings the holy spear at Parsifal , expecting to wound him as grievously as Amfortas . But the youth has committed no sin , he is quite pure ; so the spear remains poised above his head , until he stretches out his hand , and , seizing it , makes a sign of the cross , adjuring the magic to cease :  --  ' This sign I make , and ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which thou with this once clovest ,  --  To wrack and to ruin Falls thy unreal display ! ' At the holy sign , the enchanter 's delusions vanish , maidens and gardens disappear , and Kundry sinks motionless upon the arid soil , while Parsifal springs over the broken wall , calling out that they shall meet again . The third act is played also upon the slopes of the mountain , upon which the temple stands . Many years have elapsed , however , and Gurnemanz , bent with age , slowly comes out of his hut at the sound of a groan in a neighbouring thicket . The sounds are repeated until the good old man , who has assumed the garb of a hermit , searches in the thicket , and , tearing the brambles aside , finds the witch Kundry in one of her lethargic states . He has seen her so before in days gone by , and , dragging her rigid form out from the thicket , he proceeds to restore her to life . Wildly as of old her eyes roll about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she clamours for some work to do for the Holy Grail , and proceeds to draw water and perform sundry menial tasks . Gurnemanz , watching her closely , comments upon her altered behaviour , and expresses a conviction that she will ultimately be saved , since she has returned to the Grail after many years on the morning of Good Friday . He is so occupied in examining her that he does not notice the approach of Parsifal , clad in black armour , with closed helmet and lowered spear , and it is only when Kundry calls his attention to the stranger that he welcomes him , but without recognizing him in the least . Parsifal , however , has not forgotten the old man whom he has sought so long in vain , and is , so overcome by emotion that he can not speak . He obeys Gurnemanz 's injunctions to remove his arms , as none dare enter the holy precincts of the Holy Grail in martial array , and , planting the spear he recovered from Klingsor into the ground , he bends the knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ended , and he may at last be vouchsafed to quiet the pain which Amfortas still endures . While he is wrapt in prayer , Gurnemanz , staring at him , suddenly recognizes him as the Guileless Fool who came so long ago , and imparts his knowledge to Kundry , who confirms it . Parsifal , having finished his prayer , and recovered the power of speech , now greets Gurnemanz , and in answer to his question says that he has wandered long , and expresses a fervent hope that he has not come too late to retrieve his former fault :  --  ' Through error and through suffering lay my pathway ; May I believe that I have freed me from it , Now that this forest 's murmur Falls upon my senses , And worthy voice of age doth welcome ? Or yet  --  is ' t new error ? All 's altered here meseemeth . ' Gurnemanz is almost overcome with joy when he hears the young man declare that he has brought back the sacred lance undefiled , although he has suffered much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from him . As Parsifal now begins eagerly to question him , he mournfully relates that times have changed indeed . Amfortas still lives , and suffers untold tortures from his unhealed wound , but Titurel , the aged king , no longer quickened by the sight of the Holy Grail , ( which has never again been unveiled since his unhappy visit , ) has slowly passed away , and has closed his eyes in a last sleep . At these sad tidings Parsifal faints with remorse , and Gurnemanz and Kundry restore him with water from the holy spring , with which they also wash away all the soil of travel . As he comes to life again , inquiring whether he will be allowed to see Amfortas , Gurnemanz tells him that the knights are to assemble once more in the temple , as of old , to celebrate Titurel 's obsequies , and that Amfortas has solemnly promised to unveil the Holy Grail , although at the cost of suffering to himself . He wishes to comfort the knights , who have lost all their courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forth and battle for the right in the name of the Grail . To enable Parsifal to appear in the temple , Gurnemanz now baptises him with water from the spring , and Kundry , anointing his feet with a costly perfume , wipes them with her hair . Parsifal rewards her for this humble office by baptising her in his turn . Then Gurnemanz anoints Parsifal 's head with the same ointment , for it is decreed he shall be king , and after he and Kundry have helped him to don the usual habit of the servants of the Holy Grail they proceed , as in the first act , to the temple , and once more enter the great hall . As they appear , the doors open , and two processions enter , chanting a mournful refrain . Ten knights bear the bier containing Titurel 's corpse , the others carry the wasted form of the wounded king . The chorus ended , the coffin is opened , and at the sight of the dead Titurel all the assistants cry out in distress . No wail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who mournfully addresses his dead father , imploring him to intercede for him before the heavenly throne , and to obtain for him the long hoped for and long expected release . Then he bids the knights uncover the Holy Grail ; but ere they can do so he bursts out into a paroxysm of grief , exposing his bleeding and throbbing wound , and declaring he has not the courage to endure the sacred beam of light from the Holy Grail . But , unnoticed by all , Parsifal , Gurnemanz , and Kundry have drawn near . Suddenly the youth extends the sacred spear , and , touching Amfortas with its point , declares that its power alone can stanch the blood and heal the wounded side , and pronounces the absolution of his sin :  --  ' Be whole , unsullied and absolved , For I now govern in thy place . Oh blessed be thy sorrows , For Pity 's potent might And Knowledge 's purest power They taught a timid Fool . ' No sooner has the sacred point touched the wound than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the arms of Gurnemanz , all the knights gaze enraptured at the spear . Then Parsifal announces that he is commanded by Divine decree to become the guardian of the Grail , which he unveils and reverently receives into his hands . Once more the hall is darkened , once more the beam of refulgent light illumines the gloom , and , as Parsifal slowly waves the vessel to and fro , a snowy dove , the emblem of the Holy Grail , hovers lightly over his head . Suddenly the beam of light falls across the face of the dead Titurel , who , coming to life again in its radiance , raises his hand in fervent blessing ere he sinks back once more to peaceful rest . Kundry , too , has seen the Holy Grail before her eyes closed in death , and Amfortas , cured and forgiven , joins the knights and invisible choir in praising God for his great mercy , which endures forever . 4 See the author 's ' Legends of the Middle Ages , ' in press .
