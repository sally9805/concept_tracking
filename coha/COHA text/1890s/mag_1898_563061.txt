txt IT is always painful and humiliating to expose the weaknessesand shortcomings of the members of one 's own profession , but the truth , like a severe surgical operation or a very bitter dose of medicine , often proves of great advantage in the long run . I refer to the part played by the medical profession in constructing the fraudulent pension list which the tax payers of the United States have had saddled on them . Every man who sustained a uiental or physical injury which in any way impaired his usefulness in after life should be liberally pensioned for such impairment , provided the injury was received while in the discharge ot his duty as a soldier in the defence of the Union . This was the orginal theory of our pension system ; it is common justics , and no one could object to it . When the war ended and the government started In to find out who had been permanently injured in its defence , it had to employ medical examiners . And just here politics and a false economy worked their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensions became a reward for politicti activity in the interest of the party in power . But worse still is the fact , that the niggardly fees established by the government in payment for examinations and reports on the physical condition of applicants for pensions made it utterly impossible to secure anything like the best medical skill and experience . No better proof of this latter statement is-needed than the fact thatthe fees of a pension examinet in New York City , where the work is most arduous , averages less than one thousand dollars per year . Maudlin sentimentality , the fact that the applicant for a pension happens to be the political or personal friend of the examiner , or that the examiner is his family physician , ought not to have any weight or influence on the report and recommendation of the medical examiner in a given case . The reports of the medical examiners should in all cases be made without fear , favor , or affection , and should turn entirely on the question : Did the applicant , while in the discharge of his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease which has to any extent resulted in permanent disability ? This is a question easily determined by honest and competent examiners . Another fact should not be overlooked in this connection , viz. : A large percentage of mankind have one standai*d of honesty when getting money out of the treasury of an individual man , and quite another standard when getting it out of the nation 's treasury , which is nothing but the joint property of all men . If the officials selected by the people to seek out and properly compensate men who were disabled in the , defence of the Union had exercised onehalf // the care that the life insurance companies do in avoiding bad risks , the pension roll would present a very di*erent appearance from what It does to-day . Not only should the pension roll be the " nation 's roll of honor , " but the Individual pensioner should point with pride to the fact that he had been honestly deemed worthy of the practical thanks of his countrymen . A pension should be regarded as the Republic 's badge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the pension business of this country , and I blush to own that my profession has taken no small part in it . Here is a method by which frauds and pretenders can be gotten rid of . Let Congress pass a law requiring a re-examination of every pensioner , or applicant for pension , who bases his claim on physical disability contracted while discharging his duty as a Union soldier . A board of medical examiners should be established in each Statetwo or more boards might be required in some States to facilitate matters . Each board should be composed of two members , one a surgeon and the other a physician . They should be selected solely for their eminent and ac. knowledged professional ability and their honesty and standing in the State . They should give all their time to this work and be paid a salary of twenty thousand dollars each per year . They should carefully examine every pensioner in their respective States and repoit to the government exactly the physical condition of each , and how much , if any , disability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secession . They would be influenced by nothing except the physical facts presented , and always give the applicant the benefit of any doubt . Such a re-examination would require about one year to complete it , and wouldcost the government from two to three millions of dollars . No man can predict certainly what the result of this re-examination would be . My experience for twenty years in the practice of my profession has made me familiar with the physical condition of a number of pensioners , and basing my opinion on my own experience I believe at least onethird of those claiming to have been permanently disabled while in the discharge of duty will be found to be frands , and would be dropped from the pension roll . In any event It would silence criticism , remove the stigma fromdeserVing pensioners , and establish better relations between the general public who pay and the veterans of the war who receive pensions . Jonbi H. GIuD*1EB , M.D. ARE THEIIE TOO MANY CHURCHES ? IT is scarcely a grateful task to criticise an institution , which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless most intimately and vitally connected with its welfare . Yet it Is safe to assume that many of those who love the Christian Church most and best , and who have ever cheerfully given largely , both of time and means , to promote its interests , are coming to recognize , albeit with pain , that very serious attention must be bestowed upon ecclesiastical economics . The conviction is growing that churchly luxuriesare becoming an onerous tax upon communicants ; that In many sections church buildings are obviously too numerous , and the expense incident upon their maintenance a constant drain upon their supporters . Too frequently also , in the struggle to meet such expense , questionable and even pronouncedly discreditable methods are resorted to . // 376 It must be regretfully acknowledged that the particular thing which the greatevangelical prophet rapturously extolled as being " without money and without price " has become decidedly expensive in many quarters , and of even fabulous value in not a few . Indeed , a bird 's eye view of the state of the Church , while embracing many fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives which can not but induce disquietude and alarm . The financial obligations of the Kingdom are great not because of the cost of telling the gospel story in far-away lands , norwhere it is needed quite as materially-ia the great home centres of sin and degradation , but because of the erection and maintenance of too many , and too sumptuous edifices of worship , which exhaust the purses of those who assemble within their walls , and paralyze all other efforts than those of mere self-preservation . It is literally as well as metaphorically true that the Kingdom-be it affirmed with all reverence I-is a sadly mortgaged one . And since it is so much holier than any demesne of mere terrestrial royalty , it consequently suffers the greater embarrassment and depreciation . True pastors of the flock , whose entire time ought to be devoted to various spiritual ministries , are frequently compelled to spend a large portion of it in devising means of relief for their financially distressed constituents and their official boards , while the subtle influence of the Kingdom , potent under normal conditions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror is bedimmed by a breath . The year-books of the various denominations tell a significant tale . Take , for instance , the statistics of one of the most influential bodies among the middle classes , in a highly populous and flourishing district . Upon fewer than two hundred churches ( about two-thirds of the whole number ) there is a mortgaged indebtedness of a million dollars , The annual interest is not less than fifty thousand dollars , and how to raise it is , in the majority of cases , a perennially perplexing problem . It is well known that in many churches promptness in meeting such obligations , as well as accounts due to tradesmen , is not a conspicuous characteristic . The church mortgage is not a respecter of denominations ; although , curiously enough , there is at least one body of Christian believers , which , whether from doctrinal peculiarity or economical considerations , erects no houses of worship , but appoints its meetings wherever they can be entertained-often , in rural communities , in barns ! Conventional ecclesiastical *sthetics stand aghast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of Proverbs , it may be averred that an unconsecrated barn free of debt is preferable to a heavily mortgaged cathedral . It is an open question whether it is ever justifiable to build exceedingly costly churches , even when they can be paid for . The exactions of the royal builder of the far-famed first Temple probably helped to pave the way for the disruptionof his kingdom . A tithe of the money spent in the erection of fashionable churches , into which the poor will not go-another feature to be profoundly deprecated-would provide a host of neat , Inexpensive edifices in neighborhoods where none are now found ; or assist struggling societies In their very shadow , which are doing good work under adverse circumstances . The exquisite New Testament Incident of the alabaster box of precious ointment has often been wrested from its true setting to serve as an apology for lavish church adornment . But we dare not for a moment cherish the // conception that the sweet gift of penitence and love had been purchased " on credit . " Some of the means used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme . While there are , of course , some entertainments which tend to edification , there are many others which bring a blush to the cheek of the lover of the exalted dignity of the Church . A " bazaar " is almo t invariably a monopoly of the business of little shops , whose keepers keenly feel the intrusion , even though they may not resent it . A church supper , or other form of sociable , when held occasionally to promote church fellowship , may be an actual means of grace ; but rarely will it thus result when designed as a mercantile venture . The true principle of acceptable offerings should unvaryingly be taught , both by precept and example ; and the measure of the gift should not be determined impulsively , after some eloquent and fervent appeal , but after deliberate meditation upon both the need and the available resources of supply . The employment of children to canvass homes and places of business for the sale of tickets for church entertainments is open to grave criticism . More humiliating still , Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to door all kinds of mysteries of cookery , and sundry other small merchandise , the profits to be applied to " clearing the church debt . " Recently a confectioner besieged young people 's societies throughout the land , with advertist , ments of " cough medicine " at low wholesale rates , to be sold in behalf of church support . This novel method of complying with the injunction to heal the sick is mildly suggestive of the materialistic tendency of the Church , But there are more flagrant practices - as , for instance , the popular minor lotteries-which the law of some States accounts gambling , and which the Head of the Church might be expecced to rebuke with the whip of small cords , were He to appear in its midst . It will , of course , be protested that a very small amount per capita is spent upon religion , when compared with the sums squandered upon luxurious dissipation . But this has not the slightest relation to the matter in question . It is admitted that many persons appear to have no adequate comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not be compelled to subscribe to the treasury of the Church , nor has the spirit of Christianity ever contemplated such coercion . Let the Church do missionary work among such laggards , but meanwhile let the coat be cut , inexorably , according to the cloth ; for the strain upon its conscientious and faithful supporters is often a crushing one . The laborer sorely feels the loss sustained by a week 's enforced idleness , and the unavoidable expenses of the home are frequently severe upon the far more well to do . Low wages , the oft dearth of employment , the cost of medical attendance , the expensiveness of mortuary customs , precipitate many a family into a slough of despond from which it never emerges . Under such circumstances there is little opportunity for " putting by for a rainy day ; " yet the only salvation is to insist upon saving a little of the weekly earnings . Would it not be wise for the pulpit , whose advertised themes are not rarely widely divergent from the old-fashioned messages of the Gospel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ? There would be little risk of infracting the command not to lay up treasures upon earth , and there would be great gain in some quarters in rectitude of individual character , in general social conditions , and also In the world 's estimate of the value of religions profession . // The discouraging circumstances which confront us compel the conclusion that many communities are overchurched ; and that the struggle to maintain the buildings and secure the stipend of ministry-sometimes too large and oftener painfully meager-is too great to be endured by people of scanty means . Although it is frequently contended that the churches in the cities could not accommodate a tithe of the population , were it to become universally church-going , were it not wiser to wait until the present edifices are filled before building more ? There is a maximum of spare space in the majority of them which might be occupied , who can tell , if it were not so costly .

There was a time when a most efficient system of pastoral supply was maintained by certain denominations , by the grouping together of a number of churches In a " circuit , " with a single pastor It is quite credible that the preaching , infrequent as it was , was better digested and discussed than in these days of luxuriant pulpit diet , when every hamlet clamors for its convenient church and pastor ; and villages which might creditably sustain a single church are hampered with four or five , because of the strong impulse of denominationalism . Surely in these days of felicitous interdenominational relationshipthe great-hearted leaders of the various folds could agree upon some such arrangement regarding the planting of churches at home as that which so wisely pre*ails in foreign missionary fields ; so that a feeble church founded in a sparse community might be stimulated by hope , and not disheartened by rivalry .

No Utopian scheme of organic unity is hereby proposed , for the integrity of each denomination would be conserved , rather than weakened , and the cause of the general church immensely promoted . And perhaps , with the new and genial environment which would ensues meretricious methods of finance would disappear ; and " Jonah 's umbrella , " raised occasionally by some minister driven to desperate straits to secure a congregation , be lowered and put permanently in a corner , while the simple themes of the Sermon on the Mount-as fresh and practical at the present day as they were when first delivered-would be presented to wondering and delighted flocks , which have long suffered from the malady of gospel indigestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often succeeded the feast of fat things . ALDEN W. QUrNIBY . SOME SOCIAL ASPECTS OF SCHOOL TEACHING . MANY persons who know something of the trials and difficulties which a public school teacher encounters in governing her school of fifty or sixty pupils , are yet unacquainted with the real problems of her real mission as a real guide and instructor who is responsible for the moral , intel- // 379 lectual and physical development of those under her care . In the training of the minds committed to her charge she must employ the usual subjects of Instruction-reading , arithmetic , science , geography , grammar , music , drawing and others ; and it is oft-times thought that the use of these agencies is a very simple matter when once theyare acquired by the teacher herself . The average laymen does not , and perhaps can not , appreciate the difference between knowing a subject and understanding how to use it so as to secure proper development of the child mind ; and he will accordingly judge that when one has finished his scholastic training he will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach , because he is already acquainted with them . This view has been quite commonly held in the past , but is being rapidly , and very rightfully , abandoned in our own day . The first requisite of a successful teacher now , aside from her ability to organize and control a number of pupils working together , is not be tech . nically familiar with such subjects as reading , arithmetic , and the like , but be able to present them in such manner that the pupil will not only acquire them readily , but will be deeply interested in the process and will receive valuable discipline thereby . A teacher in our times , then , must understand the minils of her children ; she must comprehend the relation of the physical and mental , and must be a student of the influences of heredity , home life and environment upon the mind of each pupil whom she instructs . If she finds defects or deficiencies either emotional or intellectual , she must diligently and conscientiously single out the elements which make up the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , so that she may modify or eliminate the effect In a proper manner . This is of infinitely more importance than to possess technical knowledge of the branches of study-such knowledge , for example , as the lawyer has of law and the mechanical engineer has of machinery . lhere is great difficulty connected with this work also , for the study of the mind is necessarily very abstract , and no one can hope to attain much success in it unless he apply himself in the most diligent and watchful manner . In a way , of course , every one studies human nature , but yet very few know much about the workings of the mind . It is one thing to be able to judge in a general way of the character of individuals with whom we areassociated ; but it is an entirely different matter to know how that character may be developed or changed , and to understand the laws of mental action , so that when any certain effects are desired definite agencies ean be applied to bring them about . Besides these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not thought to be absolutely essential for prosperity in most callings . Being as she is a model before the eyes of childhood at a time when everything is observed and imitated , she must possess graces of heart and person which will make her not simply an example worthy to be followed , but which will enlist the sympathy and affection of her pupils . Her features must be expressive and sympathetic ; her voice gentle and modulated , and her manner gracious , quiet , and restful . Her dress must be attractve and becoming , and her whole bearing and personality such as will not only command the affection but the respect and confidence of her children . She must herself have affection and be ready in its expression . She *nust be glad and cheerful , ready in making friends , easy to approach , and social in nature . This may seem to be an ideal , but it is one that is constantly held before every teacher now , and if she fall far short of it her // 880 tenure of office can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all de sirable . It would seem in view of these things that the teacher ought to be the best paid person of any profession ; for when so much is required of her in the discharge of her arduous responsibilities in the schoolroom there is necessity for spending much time and money in preparation , and also in securing those aids toward physical and intellectual relaxation and comfort that will make it possible to endure the strain of hard and exacting labor . Even though the teacher possess the spirit of a missionary and receive a portion of ' her reward from the good she can do , still she can not fly in the face of nature a great while without making restitution in some manner . Yet it is a lamentable fact that teachers*on the average receive far less for their work than do the members of most if not all other professions . There are to-day in the public scho&amp;ls of elementary and secondary grade in our country over three hundred and eighty-eight thousand teachers who receive an average of fifty dollars per month . Among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges , and universities , and a large number who are graduates of normal and high schools . Most of them are obliged to reside away from home the greater part of the year , and so are at comparatively large expense in the maintenance of daily life . It can be seen that what is left after necessities are provided for must be very meagre indeed . If it were possible now to ascertain the average income of the lawyers , doctors , and other professional men in the country it would in all probability appear to l ) e a number of times that of the average school teacher . It is a fact of common observation that young men of ambition but of limited means who engage in public school-teaching continue at it but a short time-only long enough to accumulate a sufficiency to pay off debts , or to prepare for some other profession ; and it is universally admitted that in a financial way a young man has far greater advantages as a lawyer , even of the pettifogger sort , than does a teacher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in the employ of the government in its various departments with the wages of public school teachers as already given we see that the most moderately paid positions yield at least twice as much as does school-teaching , while the most lucrative places yield many times as much as do the majority of places in public schools . Of course itwould be hardly reverential to compare the highest positions in the gift of the state , as the presidency , headships of departments , judgeships in high courts , governorships , memberships in the national legislature , etc. , with the best places in the public school service ; but it would seem reasonable for teachers to expect that they should receive as much for their labors as a clerk or a typewriter in the employ of the government . For the purpose of illustration an example is furnished in the case of the postmaster and the superintendent of schools in a town or city of any size , say 10,000 . Here the postmaster will receive $2,500 and is allowed an assistant who performs nearly all the labor attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of affairs free to engage in other lines of business , as merchant , editor , or lawyer . In this same city the school man will receive at the most $2.000 , and will be expected to spend every moment of the working hours of day and night in furthering the educational interests of the city , incidentally looking after the teachers , pupils and parents thereof . He must be a college-trained man of broad experience , have splendid executive abilities , and be a model in moods and // manners , so that the youth of the city may profit by his example . Another illustration may be found in comparing the county school commissioner with other county officers . At the time of election the superintendent is always put last on the ticket , or practically so ; and in the matter of salary he hardly ever receives more , but rather usually less , than the county attorney who , to make a safe and modest estimate , does not do one-tenth the amount of work for the public that falls upon the school man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to private practice for private ends , and is at no expense for horses , carriages , and other means of conveyance that the county superintendent is obliged to possess ; and if he had to endure such hardships as the superintendent ordinarily does there would probably not be enough legal men left in many counties after a time to fill the offices . The representative from the county to the state legislature receives ten dollars ar1d upwards per day ( with expenses allowed ) for his presence in the comfortable rooms of the capitol ; while the county superintendent of schools receives from two to five dollars per day ( bearing his own expenses ) for a life of trial and privation in endeavoring td elevate the educational tone of his community . It may be said that a lawyer in the employ of the state , like a sol-. dier , is an exceptional man and his services should be especially recognized ; but it can not be true that it takes better men to make lawyers or soldiers than it does to make teachers-men with more intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to act instantly upon emergencies . Public school-teaching is and has been discriminated against in the distribution of financial rewards for labors performed . The effect of this is very unfortunate , not so much on account of the deplorable condition which public school-teaching is in , but because of the far greater benefit that might result to the community if it received its just deserts . As it is now , teaching is ruinous to the health and spirits of a large number of those who are engaged in it . Their incessant and arduous labors without opportunities for needed relaxation , and even the ordinary comforts of life , keep them in a worn and nervous condition which has already become so characteristic of the American public school-mistress that it is said to be possible to tell her wherever you see her . As a class they are known to be a plain folk , exceedingly modest in dress , too much so , indeed , to enter polite society ; and the cause is evident-that the returns from their labors will not permit expensiveness of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that bring relaxation and resLfulness . When a gathering of public school teachers takes place in a town or city of considerable size , there is sometimes much merriment on the part of the citizens at the expense of the plain , commonplace appearance of the " wielders of the rod , " as the newspapers put it . The effect of this discrimination is most unwholesome upon pupils , for they are obliged to associate for six hours of the day , and nine months of the year with a teacher who , in far too many instances , is not a fit companion at all for childhood , because she has lost that cheerfulness and spontaneity which hard , unremitting labor with many cares and anxieties have been accountable for . There is apt also to be that severity and impatience in the classroom which comes from the worn condition of the teacher ; and surely no influence could be more harmful to the child whose disposition and character are in a large way formed by the things his eyes and ears feed upon during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions seriously retard the true development of our commonwealth , because they encourage those who are lacking in qualities that would win them success in other fields to enter the profession of teaching . One must be blind who does not see that the principal criterion of worth and work in our times is the amount of money that services can command ; and it may not be expected that those with superior endowments will remain where , if they continue , conditions will deprive them early of the use of their powers because of the arduousness of their duties , while at the same time they will be more poorly rewarded than in almost any other profession they might enter . Thus it has come about that in a way the less able and qualified persons in any community fall into the teaching profession because the most capable do not care to enter ; and in many cases those in the profession who possess natural abilities leave it as soon as an opportunity offers itself , feeling that they might keep better company elsewhere , as well as have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to search far for the causes that have brought about this condition of affairs . In the first place , a vast amount of public money has been and is now appropriated for educational purposes ; and there is a conviction among statesmen and public officials that a due proportion of the people 's funds , considering other public interests , is already devoted to the cause of education . But a serious difficulty lies in the fact that there are more persons engaged in teaching than in all other matters of public concern combined ; and when it is remembered that practically every adult in our country has passed from six to twelve years in a public school , the great magnitude of this business as compared with any other under public control can be appreciated . But there are other factors which have operated to place teaching at a disadvantage , important among which is that it has uot even yet at tamed the dignity of a profession in the eyes of the public , but is generally regarded as a makeshift , being done by those who for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort . And further , teachers as a class have not been considered an influential element in establishing the political or social tone of the community , so that those who make the laws , and ma way distribute public endorsement and patronage , are apt to overlook them , sPeing only the lawers or business men who tower far above them . Tradition has in some way limited the teacher 's activity to the schoolroom , and fear of public criticism finds it quite closely centered there even in our own time and since it is only by active participation in all political and social matters that any individual or class of individuals can receive the attention due them by the public , it can be seen that because of his isolation from public affairs the teacher has a comparatively small showing . It may be that his business unfits him for much fighting in the political arena , for his purposes and methods are not often in harmony with those of the common politician ; but however it be , it is evident that teaching has suffered because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the establishment of laws and customs by which they are themselves governed , and by which their relations to the rest of the body politic are determined . It is in a way a remarkable fact that everyone connected with the law , either in its making , its interpretation , or its execution , receives great rewards for his services ; and all of the buildings and other equipment // necessary for the admhistration of law are always of the most elaborate and expensive kind . This may be accounted for partially by the fact that those who make the laws are in many cases engaged also in their interpretation and execution , and it is but natural that they should have first thought of themselves and their posterity ; and this sort of thing is going on in every community at the present time . But in addition to this , however , there has always been a peculiar reverence for law and lawyers in our land , and in the times when every lawyer was a statesman perhaps this reverence was well placed ; but in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially worthy or have responsibilities beyond what most other individuals of the community sustain are profiting by the favor which custom has always shown their species . How now may matters be impro *ed so that teaching will be rated higher in public estimation , and receive due financial rewards P The answer seems simple , that legislators must recognize the importance of the teacher in determining the safety and well-being of the state . However much may be professed by those in places of authority in regard to the education of the people being the safeguard of the nation , yet in practice they often fail to show the practice of their belief . The truth probably is , however , that legislators and statesmen have the cause of public education upon their minds less than they really think they do , or at least avow they do ; and that those other matters of public interest ,  --  the administration of law , Improvements in various kinds of business enterprises , as agriculture , commerce , and so onhave absorbed most of their thoughts and sympathies , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's point of view there seems to be no factor in American life which is now , and must ever continue to be , so influential in determining the course of national development as the public education of the people ; and as worth and efficiency in any calling are secured only by adequate rewards it is evident that public school teaching will never attain the position it should take until the present discrimination against it in financial matters , at least , ceases to exist . It is not alone legislators and statesmen who fail to behold education in its true relation to other interests of public concern , but the people at large must themselves answer to the charge of short-sightedness in placing teaching in the position that it occupies in most communities . It is not unjust to say that in a large proportion of public school positions the cheapness of the teacher is a more important element in securingher election and retention than any qualification of scholarship , pedagogical insight , or character . This apathy on the part of the public is no doubt due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these can be arrived at and believed in by those who determine the character of public school-teaching in the various communities , there can be little hope for any improvement upon present conditions.
