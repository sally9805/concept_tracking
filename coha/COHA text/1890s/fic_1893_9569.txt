Note : 1Kb Maint text REV . GEORGE HARTLEY : And you say you took these things ? MRS . ROYCROFT : Yes , I did . I must have taken them . The two are in Hartley 's study , which opens into his church , and the strains of organ practice reach them from time to time through the door standing slightly ajar ; the sun through the painted window behind Mrs. Roycroft throws the colors on the floor between them . He sits fallen back in his armchair before his desk , and she droops forward from a low seat fronting him , with her clasped hands pressed between her knees , and her shoulders lifted in a figure of hopeless desolation . A necklace and some other trinkets glitter on the desk ; Hartley lifts them and tosses them farther from him . HARTLEY : Why do you say , " must have taken them "  --  that way ? Do n't you know ? MRS . ROYCROFT , in a voice hardly above a husky whisper : Yes . No . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( After a moment ) I was very unhappy . I did n't know what I was doing . HARTLEY : But why should your unhappiness  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : Do n't ask me . I ca n't explain . HARTLEY : Hmmm ! ( After a pause ) Was there any one near who could have seen you ? MRS . ROYCROFT : No . Yes . Must I tell you ? Perhaps I ought . HARTLEY : Not unless you wish . You are not a member of my society , Mrs. Roycroft . Why have you come to me ? MRS . ROYCROFT : Because  --  because you are good . HARTLEY , perceptibly moved : You must n't say that sort of thing . MRS . ROYCROFT , very humbly : No , I know it . I came  --  I came because you were a friend of his . HARTLEY : His ? What do you mean ? Whose friend ? MRS . ROYCROFT : Mr.  --  Lannard 's . She sinks yet more abjectly forward . HARTLEY : Lannard 's ? What has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It was he  --  who was near me . HARTLEY : And you think he saw you ? MRS . ROYCROFT : He made no sign of it . He would n't ! HARTLEY , with quick and stern decision : Well , there is only one thing  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : Yes , yes . Advise me , do ! I came for that ! HARTLEY , still severely : Then I advise you in common honesty and common sense to get these things back at once . Get them to the salesman who showed them to you , so that he may not be suspected . And for your soul 's sake I advise you  --  MRS . ROYCROFT , dropping to her knees before him : Yes , yes ! HARTLEY : I advise you to make confession as well as restitution . Go and tell Planet Brothers what you have done  --  MRS . ROYCROFT , springing to her feet : Never ! Is this your idea of advice ? They would put me in prison . And I thought you were so good ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will save me ? HARTLEY , with a deep sigh : Oh , I can " save " you , as you call it . I suppose I can keep these things , the body of your sin , and send them back to Planets ' so that it will not be known who  --  took them  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : You were going to say stole . Say it ! That is what the world would call it , though I expected from you  --  HARTLEY : Oh , it does n't matter about the words . It 's the thing that matters . But before I meddle with it , you have got to make a clean breast of it . MRS . ROYCROFT : How do you mean ? HARTLEY : How came you to notice that Lannard was near you ? MRS . ROYCROFT : He was at the same case ; he was choosing a ring . ( Suddenly , with a pounce ) He has been here ! You can not deny it ! HARTLEY : But I do deny it ; he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask you a question , if I am to help you . Has Lannard 's name been associated with yours ? MRS . ROYCROFT , with joyous relief : Mr. Lannard ? Why , he 's a boy ! The idea is absurd . But I 'm so glad you mentioned it , Mr. Hartley . Now I can tell my husband , and he 'll see how ridiculous such things are . Why , I had motored to Planets ' with Mr. Manvers , and left him in the car at the door , and the idea of my going to meet poor Charley Lannard  --  HARTLEY : I did n't say you had gone to meet him , but I 'm glad  --  though it does n't relieve the affair of a very ugly aspect for him . MRS . ROYCROFT : For Mr. Manvers ? HARTLEY : For Lannard . Do n't you know that if he was there at the same showcase suspicion may fall on him ? MRS . ROYCROFT : On Charley Lannard ? Why , he 's the soul of honor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic murmur and she droops again upon her seat ; then she suddenly starts from it . ) I must save him  --  even from suspicion . I will tell all . I will go to the detectives , and confess everything . I will put myself under arrest . Charles Lannard ! ( She rushes toward the street door of the study , all excitement , but turns impetuously back to Hartley , who has vaguely risen , and appeals to him with clasped hands . ) And you will never , never let him know that I have done it ? HARTLEY , in alarm : But wait , Mrs. Roycroft . Your children  --  your husband  --  you must think of them ! MRS . ROYCROFT : Oh , he has an account there . And I could manage the detectives myself , if it came to that . But there is no time to be lost if they suspect poor Charley . HARTLEY : Stop ! Let us talk it over . You must n't do anything rash . He puts himself between her and the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you dare to hinder me , Mr. Hartley , if you do n't let me pass instantly , I will scream , I will make a scene , I will go into hysterics ; I do n't know what I 'll do . Will you  --  She whips round him , and out of the doorway , and he remains staring at it , when Doctor Tolboy appears within it . TOLBOY : Who was that perturbed female ? Or do they all leave your study in some such state ? HARTLEY , after a moment of silence : Tolboy , I want your advice  --  TOLBOY : Is it so bad as that ? Then you want my approval . HARTLEY : No , neither ; your help . That was Mrs. Roycroft  --  TOLBOY : I knew it , but I thought I would give you the benefit of the doubt . What 's she been doing now ? HARTLEY : Oh , my dear fellow , she 's been stealing  --  stealing from Planet Brothers . ( He waves his hand nervelessly toward the desk where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bends over it , whistling softly . ) And it 's happened so that the suspicion may fall upon poor young Charles Lannard . But I must say that as soon as she realized that , she was horror-stricken , and she 's rushed out to take the blame on herself . She 's gone to the Planets ' to confess  --  to tell the detectives , and take the consequence . I could n't stop her . ( Tolboy listens with dismay that passes into something different , when Hartley concludes . ) She said she would manage them . TOLBOY : I 've no doubt she 'll try it . ( He smiles not quite cheerfully . ) But what 's Lannard got to do with it ? Where does he come in ? HARTLEY : She says he was at the same showcase looking at rings . I suppose he was looking at wedding-rings ; he 's to be married next week . TOLBOY : Did she seem to have known that ? HARTLEY : I ca n't say . But what do you mean ? TOLBOY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then was sorry for it ? HARTLEY : How do I know ? Why should she have taken the things ? TOLBOY : Why should she have left them here , if she was going back to restore them and give herself up ? HARTLEY , in despair : I did n't think of that . What do you advise me to do ? TOLBOY : You ought to have stopped her going , till you could think it over . HARTLEY : I did try , but she escaped . TOLBOY : Well , I do n't see what you can do now except wait developments . Poor old Roycroft ! I do n't envy him his job . HARTLEY : Tolboy , I do n't like the tone you take . I know that you think lightly of Mrs. Roycroft , and I 'll own myself that I have no great  --  But this is a serious matter . It does n't involve her alone ; it involves Lannard . TOLBOY : I should think Lannard was out of it , unless she repents of repenting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's practising in there ? He nods toward the door giving into the church . HARTLEY : It 's Lamm , our new organist . But  --  TOLBOY , listening : Rather nice , is n't it ? HARTLEY : Yes . I do n't know . I suppose so . But , Tolboy , if Lannard  --  TOLBOY , recurring to him from the music : What sort of fellow is Lannard ? HARTLEY : He 's a noble fellow . He 's his father all over again ! TOLBOY : And a little more ? I always suspect your noble fellows , you know . But I had n't seen Lannard for some time before I went abroad , and he may be all right in spite of you . Who 's he going to marry ? HARTLEY : The finest girl in the world ! Margaret Wilson . TOLBOY : Nettie Devoe 's daughter ? HARTLEY : Yes . And she 's as like her mother as he is like his father . They  --  A knock at the street entrance arrests him . TOLBOY , escaping toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to say she ca n't find Sherlock Holmes  --  HARTLEY , seizing Tolboy : You must n't go , Tolboy ! I ca n't let you  --  I need you  --  Come in ! ( He releases Tolboy at sight of Charles Lannard ; and taking the young man 's hand affectionately , turns with him toward Tolboy . ) I 'm so glad to see you , my dear Charles . ( The young man is very pale , and his eyes are wild under his disordered hair . He is a slender youth in the early twenties , with a delicate , clean-shaven face . ) You know Doctor Tolboy ? LANNARD , laxly and inatttentively shaking hands : Oh , yes . I thought  --  you were n't back , yet . How do you do ? Ah ! ( He catches sight of the jewelry on Hartley 's desk . ) Then she did , she did ! I was praying she had n't ; I was hoping I had dreamed it ! HARTLEY : It 's no dream , my poor boy , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been telling Doctor Tolboy : we can speak freely before him . He 's an old friend of Mr. Roycroft 's , you know . LANNARD , without heeding : Where is she ? HARTLEY : She 's gone to Planets ' . She came here and told me everything , and I advised her to make confession and restitution , as the only means of diverting suspicion from you . LANNARD : From me ? HARTLEY : You were at the same show-case buying a ring  --  LANNARD : My wedding-ring ! Yes ? HARTLEY : And as soon as these things are missed , the suspicion must fall either on her or on you . LANNARD : I see . ( He realizes the fact with visible horror . ) And she 's gone to say she stole them . ( After another moment ) But she must n't ! You ought n't to have let her , Mr. Hartley . Think of her family  --  her little children . Oh , I ca n't allow it ! I will go and take the blame myself . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear me out . TOLBOY , who has been regarding him with a smile of scientific interest : But why should you do that ? LANNARD , with exaltation : Why should n't I do it ? I am a man , and she is a woman . She is a wife , and it will break her husband 's heart ; she is a mother , and her motherhood makes her sacred . TOLBOY , thoughtfully : Yes , I know . There is that view of it . LANNARD , fiercely : Is there any other ? TOLBOY : I was merely wondering whether her husband 's fatherhood made him sacred . LANNARD , indignantly : The holiest things can be turned into ridicule . HARTLEY : No , no , my dear Charles . I 'm sure Tolboy does n't mean anything of that kind . I 'm sure he 'll help us if he can . TOLBOY : I 'm afraid I ca n't , Hartley , on the lines proposed . But  --  it seems to me it 's the other way about . Motherhood does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes motherhood sacred , just as a man makes fatherhood sacred if he is good and faithful and devoted . I do n't say Mrs. Roycroft is n't that sort of mother . But there are mothers and mothers . In this case there 's one consideration that Mr. Lannard seems to have overlooked , if he will allow me . HARTLEY : Certainly , my dear Tolboy . Go on ! TOLBOY : It appears that Mrs. Roycroft took the things , and that Mr. Lannard did n't . Why should he say he did ? LANNARD , as before : To save her ! TOLBOY : By a lie ? LANNARD : A lie ! TOLBOY : What should you call it , Hartley ? But perhaps if Mr. Lannard would explain why he wishes to assume Mrs. Roycroft 's guilt  --  LANNARD : Explain ? Explain ? But I have told you already ! She is a woman , a wife , a mother . If her guilt is known it will ruin her husband 's life , and blast her children 's future . Society will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wish to reflect upon you , Doctor Tolboy , but I ca n't understand what your ideals of manhood are . The man who sees a woman in the toils of her own error , and does n't feel it his duty , his right , his God-granted privilege to save her at any cost to himself , is a traitor to every tie that binds him to his mother , his sister , and  --  any one who is more precious than either . HARTLEY : You must feel the force of that , Tolboy ? TOLBOY : I 'll allow that it 's the theory in such cases . Do you preach that doctrine from your pulpit ? HARTLEY : I preach self-sacrifice . TOLBOY : Self-sacrifice founded on a lie ? LANNARD : You must n't use that word , Doctor Tolboy . You are my father 's old friend , but I ca n't suffer it . To save a woman from her sin at any cost to veracity is not lying . HARTLEY : Tolboy , you distinguish in motives ? TOLBOY : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANNARD : Then you would leave Mrs. Roycroft to her fate ? You would  --  TOLBOY : My dear young friend , you are delightful . Let me ask you a question or two . You do n't mind my sitting down , Hartley ? HARTLEY : My dear Tolboy ! Do sit down , both of you . LANNARD : I will stand . And we are losing time when there 's not a moment  --  TOLBOY , comfortably seating himself : I do n't believe Mrs. Roycroft is hurrying . But suppose we leave her out of the question ? LANNARD : We ca n't . She is the question . TOLBOY : Well , not the only one . You wo n't think it too great a freedom in an old friend of your father  --  and your mother too  --  if I tell you I 'm greatly interested in your engagement ? LANNARD , softened into momentary forgetfulness : Not at all , doctor . It 's very kind of you . TOLBOY : I used to dance with her mother when We were both a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I , and she danced charmingly . It 's very pretty his son being engaged to her daughter . LANNARD : Thank you , Doctor Tolboy . TOLBOY , musingly : He was such a knightly spirit ! He could have been a very rich man , at one time , if he had been willing to say the thing that was not  --  just a little . But he died poor . LANNARD : My mother told me as soon as I was old enough to understand . TOLBOY : Ah , your mother ! I hope she 's well ? I 've been away so long . Ever since I gave up practice nearly five years ago . And your sister ? LANNARD : They 're both well , thank you . They will like to know you asked for them . TOLBOY : I hear you 've done very well for yourself . You 're not sorry your father left you to fight your own way ? LANNARD : He left me his name . TOLBOY : And that was enough . ( Presently ) By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Planets ' to-day ? LANNARD , recurring to her with a start : I believe Mr. Manvers had motored up with her . He did n't come in . TOLBOY : How about that business , Hartley ? HARTLEY : I do n't talk scandal , my dear Tolboy . TOLBOY : Ah , it is scandal , then . I hoped it was only slander when I heard of it in Rome . HARTLEY : Has it travelled so far ? The affair was broken off at one time  --  Manvers went abroad . Wretched woman ! TOLBOY : Yes , it 's a pity such a fool has any man 's happiness in her keeping . But Roycroft married too late or she married too soon . ( To Lannard ) You thought of taking the blame of such a woman on yourself ? LANNARD : I wished to save her  --  and to save her husband too . If the matter got into court , it would be known that she had come with Manvers  --  But it 's too late now to do anything . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . ) She 'll be under arrest , by this time . How could you let her go , Mr. Hartley ? If they bring her here , I 'll accuse myself ; I 'll declare that I took the things . TOLBOY : I doubt if that will save her ; and as for saving Roycroft , is it saving a man to keep him from knowing that his wife is flirting with another man ? He refers the point to Hartley , with a glance . HARTLEY , after a moment : I do n't believe it was ever the slightest use in the world . She would n't repent because she was kept from disgrace , and he would n't be spared by the deception . Hartley has the air of being surprised into these conclusions . TOLBOY , turning to Lannard : But if you succeed in keeping Roycroft from knowing that his wife was out motoring with Manvers , by taking the infamy of her theft on yourself  --  it seems a long way about  --  you will also have the satisfaction of saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( After a pause ) Does she  --  excuse me  --  know your fiance ? LANNARD : They are acquainted . TOLBOY : Not friends ? LANNARD : Margaret is much younger . TOLBOY : She will have the severity of youth . How will she like your taking Mrs. Roycroft 's sin upon yourself ? She wo n't believe you guilty ; but what will she think of your motive ? Will she think you had any duty in the matter except to keep out of it ? Will she be proud of your sacrificing yourself for a woman she does n't respect ? Wo n't she feel that you owed something  --  perhaps more  --  to her ? LANNARD , desperately : In this matter it 's for me to act alone . TOLBOY : That 's the way it 's looked at in the strange world where such sacrifices are common . But in this world we are entangled in ties . Suppose this young girl , to whom you 've given your promise to be all in all to her , agreed to let you do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and pride in you are hallowed by the memory of your father , who refused fortune for truth 's sake ; but you propose to bring dishonor on her by helping a faithless woman hoodwink her trusting husband . You wish to cover yourself with disgrace for a creature who has not a rag of common honesty  --  LANNARD : Oh , you do n't understand ! Do n't you see that this is n't a thing that I choose , but a thing that I must do ? That every instinct of my nature , every impulse of my soul forces me to it ? Can I coldly choose between the noble and the ignoble part ? Can I leave this woman to her fate because she is weak and wicked ? All the more because she is weak and wicked I must shield her , at any cost to myself and those dear to me . Where  --  where have you learned your cold-blooded doctrine  --  excuse my speaking so to my father 's old friend  --  your heartless philosophy ? But no matter , I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , but you ca n't be true to yourself in a lie . It 's morally impossible . You can only be false . LANNARD : Then I will be true to her . TOLBOY : And false to all those others ? ( In lifting their voices they have been unaware of a knocking at the street door , but in the pause they now make it timidly repeats itself . ) There 's somebody there , Hartley . Probably Mrs. Roycroft in irons . I could n't bear that . I 'll just slip into your sanctuary , and listen to your organist  --  As he escapes into the church by one door , the other slowly opens , and Mrs. Roycroft is seen leaning against one of the jambs , faint and alone . MRS . ROYCROFT , piteously : Oh , I was afraid there was no one here ! I kept knocking and knocking , and at last I had to open it myself . ( She starts at sight of Lannard . ) You here , Mr. Lannard ? HARTLEY , with a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knows everything . But where  --  MRS ROYCROFT , coming forward and dropping into the low chair she occupied before : I had n't the courage . I thought I could do it , but I could n't . I 've been walking round and round , trying to , and coming back here , and going again , and coming back . Do you blame me ? What will you think , Mr. Lannard , if the suspicion falls on you , and I let it ? What will Margaret think ? But she hates me already ! Let me go  --  I will make another effort . Oh , how cold you both are ! ( She tries feebly to rise , but sinks back in her chair , and leaning forward , puts her face in her hands . ) I ca n't ! But Mr. Hartley will bear me witness that I wanted to have myself arrested , and you will believe , Mr. Lannard , that I exonerated you to him ? ( They continue silent , and she confronts them vividly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you are against me  --  two against one ! How unmanly ! But men are always so ! Oh , what shall I do ? Wo n't you speak to me , Mr. Lannard ? I know you think I 'm bad . HARTLEY , with lessened sternness : Did n't you say yourself , a few minutes ago , that you had taken them ? MRS . ROYCROFT : Taken what ? Oh ! ( With disdain for the jewelry toward which Hartley waves his hand ) Those ! Of course I took them ! HARTLEY : Then I do n't understand  --  MRS . ROYCROFT , with hardness : I know you do n't . May I speak with Mr. Lannard a moment ? Alone , I mean . You can leave the door into the church open , if you like . HARTLEY : Really I  --  But of course , if you wish it . The door can be shut . MRS . ROYCROFT : I prefer it open  --  if you 'll take Doctor Tolboy out of earshot . Oh , I know he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't see him going away . You were discussing me , I suppose . But do n't apologize . ( She turns her back on Hartley , who , after a moment of confusion , goes into the church , and then she startles Lannard from his daze . ) What was Doctor Tolboy saying about me ? LANNARD , with a sudden access of courage : I shall not tell you , Mrs. Roycroft . MRS . ROYCROFT : It 's because Margaret hates me . She 's been talking against me , too . LANNARD : You must n't bring Margaret in , if you please . I am ready to suffer and make all those dear to me suffer , but I ca n't let you speak of Margaret so ; I ca n't let you speak of her at all . Her name is sacred . MRS . ROYCROFT : Oh ! And may I ask why you intend to suffer and make those dear to you suffer ? LANNARD : As soon as I heard from Mr. Hartley that you had taken these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and break Margaret 's heart , and kill my mother , and besmirch with infamy the stainless name my father left me , because you are a woman  --  and a wife  --  and a mother . MRS . ROYCROFT , after a moment of reflection : I see . ( With a burst ) Oh , how much better women would be if the world were full of such men ! And I had just been classing you with that poor weakling Hartley , and that venomous old Tolboy . ( She sighs deeply . ) How much I have wronged you ! ( After another silence ) But I  --  I ca n't accept this sacrifice . You shall not do this for me . I can be generous too , and I refuse it . And no one shall ever know the real reason why you would have saved me . LANNARD : The real reason ? Is n't it enough that I am a man , and that you are a woman  --  and a wife  --  and a mother ? MRS . ROYCROFT : Oh no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers , but men do n't jump at the chance of saving them . Margaret would scratch my eyes out if she knew the real reason , but  --  ( very solemnly ) she shall never know . Your secret will be safe with me , Charles . LANNARD , stupefied : Charles ! MRS . ROYCROFT : Yes , Charles . You have given me the right to call you so . You would do this thing for me only because you love me . LANNARD , in wild dismay : Oh , Mrs. Roycroft ! Love you ? Love you ? MRS ROYCROFT : Yes , me . ( She speaks sadly but fearlessly . ) You ca n't deny it . I 've known it for  --  ages . And when you were choosing your wedding-ring to-day I could see that death was in your heart . LANNARD : Death ? But I was out of my mind with joy till I saw  --  I saw  --  Then death was truly in my heart . MRS . ROYCROFT : You have to say that , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it will be easy to keep your secret because I do n't love you , Charles . No , I pity you , but I do n't love you  --  LANNARD : Oh , thank you , thank you for that , Mrs. Roycroft ! MRS . ROYCROFT : If I loved  --  if I did love you  --  nothing should have stood between us . All ties , oaths , promises , would have been threads of gossamer . I would have gone to the ends of the world with you  --  to Cairo , or Paris , or Florence , or any of those places where people go . But I do n't love you , Charles . I love no one but my husband , no one ; and I want to save him  --  save him from himself , from his mad jealousy . He is very unhappy about Frank  --  Mr. Manvers , I mean  --  and I had promised I would n't meet him , but he would join me , and he insisted on motoring with me to Planets ' , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . ROYCROFT : Oh , yes ; now I know . When I caught that look in your eyes , I knew that I was safe  --  that I could ask anything of you . LANNARD , in distress : But you 're mistaken , Mrs. Roycroft . I had no such look in my eyes . When I saw you  --  taking those things  --  the horror of it  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : I am not mistaken ; I know that look so well ; I have caught it in too many eyes ! And now I 'm going to put you to the proof . Margaret shall never dream of it . Listen ! LANNARD : But , Mrs. Roycroft , even if this were true  --  about that look  --  I do n't yet understand why you took the things  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : I was coming to that . How shall I say it ? You owe me more than you think  --  you owe me reparation for my fatal error . You did n't mean to wrong me , but when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , so bewildered , so sorry for you , Charles , thinking of poor Margaret , and everything , that I swept those wretched things into my bag and came off without realizing what I had done . I rushed into the street like a mad woman  --  by the side door  --  and left Manvers in the motor on the Avenue . I suppose he 's there yet , and I do n't know what he 'll think has become of me . But I did n't care ! I was crazed  --  crazed with pity for you , Charles , and for poor , poor Margaret ! LANNARD : But why did you accuse yourself to Mr. Hartley , if  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : Let me think , let me collect myself ! Yes , now I have it ! I did n't know where I was going ; I flew through the street , and when I came to Mr. Hartley 's church , I had an inspiration  --  a perfect inspiration . I resolved to burst in upon him and tell all . That look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You did n't tell him that , Mrs. Roycroft ? MRS . ROYCROFT : No , I spared you , Charles . When I found him so cold and repellant and stiff , I felt that I could n't trust him with anything really holy , and I stopped with the dry , commonplace facts . I simply said that I had taken the things , and when he showed me how I was letting suspicion fall upon you , I saw all , and I said I would go and confess and square the detectives  --  LANNARD : Square them ? Do you mean buy them off ? MRS . ROYCROFT : What are they there for ? But when it came to it . I had n't the courage , though I was ready to make any sacrifice for you ; and I would now , though you refuse me such a trifle as saying that you were there to meet me because you loved me so wildly . I would have done anything for you , and you wo n't do such a little thing for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't call it love . I was willing , and I am willing , to say that I took the things , and save you . But I can not take a lie upon my soul , by saying that I love you when I do n't . That would be altogether different . MRS . ROYCROFT : Different from accusing yourself of stealing , and going to prison , and getting into the papers , and everything ? LANNARD : Yes , with a whole world 's difference ! For then Margaret would know I was innocent , but if I said I loved you she would always believe it . No , I ca n't do that , Mrs. Roycroft . MRS . ROYCROFT : Say that you are afraid to do it ! ( Desolately ) Well , let it go ! I will never trust any man again . And I was so sure of you ! LANNARD , shaken : But , Mrs. Roycroft , why would it be better for your husband to think I was in love with you than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you see ? I could say , " That boy ! " and it would throw dust into his eyes completely . LANNARD , stiffly : Oh ! MRS . ROYCROFT : I only said " boy , " as an illustration . I should really say , " What , the son of your old friend , who 's always been in and out of our house like your own child ? Why , he 's devoted to Margaret Wilson , and he was there choosing a wedding-ring . " Ha , ha , ha ! You see , do n't you ? LANNARD : No , Mrs. Roycroft , I do n't see . MRS . ROYCROFT : Then you must trust to me , and my knowledge of the world , and my experience , and my being older than you , though I 'm not so very much older than Margaret , after all ; I hope she 's told you her age . LANNARD , distractedly : But how  --  when  --  am I to say what you want me to say ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , reproachfully ) I should think your love for me would dictate that if you truly loved me . LANNARD : But I do n't , Mrs. Roycroft . That is what I have said from the beginning . That 's the very point . I do n't . I should think it very wrong . I am willing to do anything else to save you . But I ca n't deceive Mr. Roycroft by pretending to be in love with you , and diverting his suspicions from Mr. Manvers . MRS . ROYCROFT , after listening inattentively : I have it , and it all works in beautifully ! You 've said you would acknowledge that you had taken these things ? LANNARD , reluctantly : Yes . MRS . ROYCROFT : Well , all you 've got to do is to say that you wished to give them to Margaret , and that you had n't the money with you , but you expected to send it after you got home ; and then in the confusion of the moment you put them into my hand-bag ; something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would prove to Mr. Roycroft that his jealousy of Mr. Manvers was quite unfounded . I call it perfect . LANNARD : But what will Mr. Hartley say ? And Doctor Tolboy ? I 've talked it over with them  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : They must confirm what you say , and they will when they see that it 's the only way out . It 's all so simple : I followed you here , do n't you know , when I saw what you had done , because I suspected that you would come and tell Mr. Hartley as soon as you realized your wicked act , and I told him that I had done it . You denied it , and waited to take the blame , and while we were disputing about it , Doctor Tolboy came in , and he decided that we ought to send for my husband , for he knows how jealous he 's been of Mr. Manvers , and when he understood that it was only you who had been with me he would be so relieved that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . It 's as plain as day , and I 'll telephone my husband at once . She starts toward the telephone , but Lannard stops her , clutching her wrist , and fetching his breath in gasps . LANNARD : And if I do this , if I tell , if I live this dreadful lie , what will you do ? MRS . ROYCROFT , gayly : Oh , I 'll square Margaret , if that 's what you mean . LANNARD , after manifest throes of deep excitement : I do n't know how to begin . But  --  I wo n't do it ! MRS . ROYCROFT : You will not save me ? You will not sacrifice yourself to save the honor of a guilty woman , and she a wife and mother ? LANNARD : Not if you were twenty mothers and a hundred wives and a thousand guilty women . I break my promises , one and all . I wo n't say I took the things , and I wo n't say I love you . I 'll keep faith with Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll break faith with you . Thank God , there 's time . MRS . ROYCROFT , advancing upon him where he stands palpitating , and hissing in his face : Silly  --  boy ! She whirls away toward the street door , as Hartley and Tolboy appear from the church entrance . HARTLEY : Mrs. Roycroft ! Wait ! Do n't go ! He hurries to his desk and gathers up the jewelry , which he stretches toward her . MRS . ROYCROFT , turning : Oh ! You 've been listening . HARTLEY : We  --  we were  --  returning . But what shall I do with these ? If the detectives  --  MRS . ROYCROFT : The detectives ? Oh ! I paid for that rubbish before I came back . ( To Lannard ) Now you can really have them for Margaret  --  my engagement gift . ( She flashes out of the door , which she crashes to behind her , and then instantly reopens . ) No . Some sort of teacup will do ; I 'll get it . Mr. Hartley , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to my house  --  I 'm going home to tell my husband all . ( With a sob ) He will believe me ! She crashes the door to behind her again . TOLBOY , after a moment of mutual consternation : I really suppose he will , if she tells him all  --  or half , poor fellow . What a wonderful woman ! ( To Lannard ) But I congratulate you , my dear boy , on being out of her clutches . There 's no use trying to blink the fact : we 've heard every word . I wanted to , and Hartley thought it was his duty  --  HARTLEY : But I still do n't understand why she wished to make me believe she had stolen those things . What reason had she , what motive ? TOLBOY : Oh , well , as a woman she would n't need a reason ; and who can ever say what a woman 's motive is ? Perhaps her nature demanded a novel play of emotion . ( To Lannard ) But whatever she meant , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know that I should have had the courage . LANNARD , brokenly : I 've fallen below my ideal . TOLBOY : The ideal of a man who thinks such a woman does such things once in a way , and may be redeemed by a good round lying piece of self-sacrifice ? But such a woman always does such things in every way , and she can only be shielded , never saved . No , no ! Never regret that in this case you 've looked out for yourself . You 've shown yourself a true hero ! Some day I hope we shall have you in the novels and the plays .
