A FARMING COMMUNITY . LAST autumn found me installed at Jndian Ridge , in the Lincoln House , a rambling white hotel , verandaed , greenblinded , and dormer-windowed . In the office , besides the usual country hotel office furnishings , were numerous potted plants and two venerable oil - paintings ( copies , without much doubt ) of Daniel Webster and George Washington . The parlor had real gilding on the panelmouldings of its doors and a fantastic display of curious marine shells , and bore signs of frequent use ; otherwise it was precisely the conventional farmhouse parlor . The chambers were simple in their furnishings , but unspeakably neat and sweet . The host and hostess , Mr. and Mrs. Abraham West , are far past middle life . Having long been free from the necessity of any kind of labor , they are keeping up their house partly from force of habit , partly as a public convenience , and partly ( and it would appear primarily ) for the sake of the society it brings them . The proprietors reserve to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies of the more objectionable order , with one or two of which , in the past , they have had disagreeable experiences . The absence of a tap-room debars that atmosphere of jovial good cheer one likes to associate with the country tavern ; but Mr. and Mrs. West devote so much of their time to agreeable converse with their guests , - they invariably preside at the table , - and business , spite of the necessary formality of the bill , enters so little into the account , that stopping with them amounts to visiting at the house of a substantial farmer . Besides the hotel , Indian Ridge - that is , the village proper - contains half a dozen grocery and general supply stores , a pump , hardware , and farming-tool es tablishment , a blacksmith 's forge , a harness shop , a cobbler 's shop , a tin shop , - in which a watch-repairer and a milliner have counters , - a church , a schoolhouse from which the national flag always floats , a Masonic hall , a town hall flanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score of dwellings . The dwellings , - which are tenanted for the most part by the business men , - as well as the places of business , are nearly all on a single elm and maple bordered street running along the summit of a ridge , in full view of one of the finest mountain ranges of New England . They belong to four pretty well defined architectural types . There are the ancient nearly square hip-roofed houses , with a chimney on each of the two end-slants of the roof , tiny-paned windows , pretentious front doors bordered by fluted side-pillars in relief and surmounted by semicircular " fans ; " the equally ancient and almost equally square , but severely plain tentroofed houses , with a single enormous square chimney in the exact centre of the roof ; the pronouncedly oblong houses with the lofty pillared portico fronts , of a later period ; and modern houses as they were before the advent of the Queen Anne furor , which has not yet struck Indian Ridge . It may be noted here in passing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of being incorporated with a store , as in most country villages , is kept by a soldier 's widow in one of the front rooms of her own house . Below the western end of the ridge and just beyond the village flows Indian Ridge Creek , a small but fairly energetic stream , spanned by a covered bridge , on whose banks a sawmill , a gristmill , and a corn-canning factory are situated . The land immediately around the village is a rolling tract , myriad - breasted like the statues of the Ephesian Diana . Such // land is never quite as beautiful as during the spring months , when its hullocks are soft silk pompons , whose shades and sheens of green under the sunlight rival those of a peacock 's plumes . Still , it is always beautiful . In October , when first I saw them , most of the hillocks had become dun and brown , - only a few , from which the second crop of grass had not been cut , retaining a shop-worn green ; but then , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matchless . These forests have as many evergreen as deciduous trees , and this combination of the sombre and the gaudy is far more effective than deciduous trees alone can possibly make , no matter how fiery their audacity . All the roads out of the village pass thrifty farms . The farmhouses are modest , - much more so than the barns and the other outbuildings to which they are prudently subordinated . Some of them are sentineled by pairs or rows of soldierly poplars , which lend the scene a finish almost European . In the autumn , the dooryards are piled with ruddy apples , yellow pumpkins , and Hubbard , marrowfat , and crook - neck squashes , and the back porches of the houses and the sunny sides of the barns are festooned with strings of corn and dried apple . Ciderpresses , at rather frequent intervals , perfume the air divinely , inviting to copious draughts of the delicious brown yin du pays without money and without price . Open wells with sweeps or windlasses alternate with pumps . Both are always provided with drinking-cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gourds - for the convenience of the thirsty passer . People meeting on the road stop " to pass the time of day " ( to adopt the phraseology of the district ) , and no driver would think of going by a foot-traveler without offering to give him a lift . Happy contrast to the regions some of us have been forced to foot it through , where a pedestrian is eyed askance as if he were a tramp , and padlocked punip - handles supplement with beautiful but pitiless logic ubiquitous signs against trespass ! Broadly speaking , Indian Ridge is a farming town . The employees of the sawmill and the gristmill are few in number , and these few , as well as most of the business men , do a little at farming . The corn-canning factory being run only in the fall , there are plenty of the farmers ' sons and daughters glad to work therein for the sake of the ready money which even the prosperous in the country often lack . There is a sleigh and wagon shop a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is also a farmer , and his only employee is also his hired farm man . Work goes on in the shop only in bad weather and off seasons . The farmers , who are all native Americans , - with the exception of three French Canadian and perhaps twice as many Irish families , - are for the most part the direct descendants of the original settlers , who were a sturdy , honest , plucky , intelligent , God-fearing stock . The lean , sharp , laconic New Englander of popular tradition is the prevailing type . There is little wealth and as little real poverty among them . Their food , dress , and home furnishings are of the siniplest . To illustrate : with a view to showing them proper respect , I put myself to great preliminary inconvenience to appear in a " boiled shirt , " the first Sunday of my stay , only to be chagrined , when the hour for the service arrived , by finding that I was rather overdressed than otherwise . The women are true helpmeets . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able and willing to milk the cows , assist in the hay - getting , and in other ways lend a hand out of doors in emnergencies . Some of them even eke out the family income by little ventures of their own , such as raising hens and bees , and gathering and marketing spruce gum , beechnuts , and blueberries . There is no servant-girl problem , because there are no servants . When sickness or sonic // other real disability necessitates female help in the household , a neighbor 's daugliter is called in . She is of course regarded , and in every minutest particular treated , as a member of the family ; it could not be otherwise . The children are trained to bear their share of the family burden , so far as it can be done without interfering with their schooling , and the very school terms are arranged with a view to conflicting as little as possible with farm work . When the children grow up , many of them go out into the world to seek their fortunes ( that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is nothing like an exodus of the rising generation , no approach to a depletion . Plenty of ambitious , vigorous young men stay behind to arrange themselves in life as their fathers did before them , chopping in the woods during the winter , and in the summer tilling the few acres they have been able to purchase with their winters ' savings . Furthermore , there are plenty of desirable young women happy and proud to cast in their lots with the young men , and do their share of the drudgery necessary in establishing a home . Thus new farms are cleared out of the woodland and the old farms are kept up . One morning , a few days after my installment at the Lincoln House , the first glance from my chamber window showed me that something out of the ordinary was on foot . The road was fringed for some distance with all kinds of pole vehicles , from which the horses had been detached . Other two-horse rigs were arriving . The reason for the sudden influx came out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased an unoccupied house , located about a mile to the northward , over the ridge , which he wished to transfer to land of his own on the western bank of the creek . There being no contractor in the vicinity who made a business of moving buildings , the people had decided to do the job for him , and they were assembling with their two-horse teams from all over the township . It was ten o'clock before the house was properly shod ( that is , fitted like a sled with a pair of enormous logs as runners ) , and eleven o'clock before the horses were attached . By that time the men on the spot numbered more than a hundred . Of these , thirty were drivers of the horses , of which there were thirty pairs in all ; as many more manipulated levers and pulleys ; as many more stood ready with skids ; and an advance skirmish line of about a score were armed with axes , crowbars , shovels , and pickaxes , with which to clear away obstructions to the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , was a fierce-looking man , with a flowing black beard more than a foot long , a coonskin cap , a red flannel shirt , trousers rolled to his knees , leaving his legs bare above his shoe-tops , and a tremendous voice . As he stood in the front door of the house shouting and gesticulating his orders , he was a startling figure , at once forceful and grotesque . Foremost with the pulleys and levers , commander , as it were , of the lever and pulley brigade , was Nathanael Seabrook , the village doctor , a lean , tall , alert , stubble-bearded man , a sort of Yankee Weelum MacLure . It was a unique and inspiring sight to see a professional man in flannel shirt , slouch hat , and rubber boots , " working like a house afire " in the performance of a purely neighborly service ; and it is easy enough to imagine a man who would thus recklessly divest himself of all but his native dignity before the eyes of his patrons , and who could swing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just such a fight for a life as the noble Drumtochty physician made for the life of the man Saunders ; and what sort of a fight that was the world knows . There was so much ado to get all the horses to pulling at the same time , all the levers and pulleys and men so placed as to secure the most power , that it was high // noon before the building was got fairly over the few rods between its site and the road . Then it was time , as the vigorous clanging of a bell proclaimed , for the dinner which the " women-folks " had prepared in a barn near by . Dinner over , the horses laid to their work so well that the building started almost immediately , without any assistance from the levers and pulleys ; and though it was an up-grade pull , and the shoes ploughed deep furrows , and the front corners crashed into the wayside saplings and dug into the banks of the narrow roadway , so that the gravel flew in at the windows , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping . Then , a quick and tremendous sideward lunge imbedded one corner so deep in a gravel-bank that the horses were thrown back on their haunches and brought to a standstill . There were prying , pulling , twisting , and veering , under the doctor 's supervision , for nearly an hour before another start could be effected . By that time it had been decided to exchange the narrow road for the open fields , - a decision which gave the skirmish line a deal of exertion of the most active kind in getting rid of obstructing stone walls and fences , twenty or thirty feet of the latter being in one case lifted bodily by them . From the moment of taking to the open fields till the arrival at the summit of the ridge , the excitement was intense . There were spurts and set-backs , sudden halts and false starts ; breakings of ropes , levers , and chains ; lashings , kickings , yellings , swearings - even old Deacon Goodhue swore and never knew it - on the part of the men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the horses ; and narrow escapes for both men and horses . An intentional halt of several minutes for breath was made upon the summit of the ridge . On the descent , the horses entered so thoroughly into the spirit of the occasion , and went so nearly as if they believed the object in tow was just about to topple over them , that the drivers had all they could do to keep up with their pace over the uneven ground , and the skid men were forced to abandon their work entirely . The building swept downward of its own momentum , carrying everything before it like an avalanche . A fence , which had not been reached by the skirmishers in time , was turned under it , and a woodpile was made short work of , without causing any visible slackening of the speed ; over both it slipped as smoothly as if they were skids placed beneath on purpose to reduce the friction . Not until the leaders were well into the creek could the horses be brought to a stop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was Jabez Lyman 's comment , and those hard by who had breath enough left to say anything said a forcible Amen . Though not quite five o'clock , it was decided at this point to quit work for that day ; crossing a stream was too difficult an undertaking to be begun in the gathering dusk . The scene of the second day 's activity being so near the village as to be practically in it , the schools were given a holiday , - a wise proceeding , surely , if for no other reason than this : that a lesson was to be learned out of doors , that day , of far greater moment than the lessons many days of school confinement could in*ulcate . The sawmill , gristmill , canning factory , and all the stores were deserted as by common consent . The postmistress , reasonably sure she would receive no call , and yet too conscientious a servant of the government to close her office without permission , took up her station at a point of vantage equidistant from the building and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . The lawyer forsook his office and the minister his study for the scene of action ; and though these worthies did not take hold just as the doctor did , they were nearly as eager as he , and were profuse of shrewd and sympathetic advice and exhortation . Even the halt , the maimed , // and the blind were on hand , trying to do their part with such members and faculties as they actually did possess . The first task was to line the bed of the creek with enormous logs lengthwise of the current , and just far enough apart to admit of the horses stepping between them . That done , the shoes were pried out of the soft soil bordering the creek , into which they had sunk during the night , the leading horses were driven several times from bank to bank to get them accustomed to the water , and the thirty teams were attached and whipped into the stream . There was an exciting moment when a horse slipped and nearly fell in mid - current , and another when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sudden breaking of the drag-chain . But in spite of these and other trifling mishaps the stream was crossed without serious accident , and the building was landed on its appointed site a little before noon . Then how the men cheered ! There were cheers for red-shirted Caleb Whitney , the stentorian boss , cheers for the doctor , cheers for the young owner of the house and his wife , cheers for the horses , - cheers for everybody and everything relevant to the occasion , and , so great was the excess of spirits , for several persons and several things that were not . Another public dinner brought the fete to a close . As a purely physical spectacle , an exhibition of physique and energy and nerve , this building-moving was as well worth viewing every way as any match of football or of polo ever played . Much more was it worth viewing as a moral spectacle ; as an exhibition of community spirit it was superb . It is because so much has been said of late regarding the decay of community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a record in detail . True , it was the most signal illustration of esprit de corps that occurred during my Indian Ridge sojourn , but I was assured it was by no means an exceptional one . Hardly a fall passes that some buildings are not dealt with after this fashion . It is only three years since the moving of a ponderous structure that occupied the citizens a whole week . The year before that a schoolhouse was transplanted , at a saving of much expense to the public treasury ; and there is a tradition of a remarkable feat of engineering , which half the town had pronounced impossible , achieved by the redoubtable Caleb Whitney in driving a barn across a deep gully . If many of the other forms of neighborly codperation which once prevailed here have disappeared , it is because the introduction of improved farm machinery and agricultural methods has taken away the reason for them . Wherever the reason survives , wherever real help can be rendered , the cooperative practice survives also , and ploughing-bees , huskings , and barn-raisings still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when all the families of Indian Ridge used to meet together on Sundays in one of the houses , to study a Bible lesson in the forenoon and teach the children the common school branches in the afternoon , and for many years thereafter , Indian Ridgers were forced by stress of circumstances , as well as led by inclination , to pull together , and the habit of pulling together has never left them . The feeling that incites to helpfulness is as hale and hearty with them as ever it was . Whether this manifests itself in a purely personal way in " little , nameless , unremembered acts of kindness and of love 's between neighbors , in building-movings and ploughing-bees , or in self-sacrificing loyalty to town , State , or nation , it is the same spirit , the spirit of solidarity , that has persisted from the beginning . In further illustration of the activity of this spirit , particularly where the town is concerned , it should be said that Indian Ridge has forty miles of roads ( superior for the section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended much gratuitous labor over and above what it has been permitted them to turn in for taxes ; a handsome and substantial drinking-fountain , erected by public subscription as a memorial to the first minister of the town ; a small but wellchosen free library , in connection with the post-office , to which the postmistress gives her services ; a soldiers ' monument which cost one thousand dollars , - a simple and tasteful marble column with the conventional inscription , " Sacred to the memory of our citizen soldiers who died in defence of their country in the war of 1861 to 1865 ; " a town house worth four thousand dollars , containing , besides the town offices , a banquet-room , a large hall with a 22 by 40 stage , equipped with a drop-curtain and five scenes * kitchen , parlor , street , forest , and prison - painted by the people themselves , and creditable dressing-rooms . Its hillside cemetery is scrupulously kept . Its primary and intermediate schools are taught by well-paid normal graduates selected with much care , and are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Its high school is almost invariably under an earnest college man , and attracts pupils from a large area beyond the limits of the township . High schools , it is true , are now made obligatory by the state law , but the high school at Indian Ridge was started and regularly maintained years before there was any law upon the subject . Nothing has come to the town by gift or bequest . These and many lesser benefits it has secured for itself , on its own initiative , by unity of aim and effort ; and it takes a colossal pride in them , as it has a right to do . In the same way , it feels an honest corporate pride in the fortunes of its ab1 It is amusing to note that the drop-curtain , which is a copy of a New England landscape painting containing a great deal of detail , was made by dividing the original canvas into small squares and the canvas for the drop into an equal number of large squares , and copying square sent sons ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it follows their careers as lawyers , doctors , merchants , preachers , inventors , and college proiessors ( to mention the vocations in which some reputation has been gained ) with as keen an interest for detail as if they were the greatest of the land . It is proud , too , of the moral aspect of the village ; how proud may be guessed from the curious fact that the only check on the intense enthusiasm felt for a muchtalked-of railroad project , which , if consummated , will put it into close touch with the rest of the world , is a vague fear that somehow the railroad may lower the high moral tone that now prevails . To be thus solidaire - who will question it ? - is to practice a kind of decentralized communal socialism that is essentially noble , and hardly to be taken exception to by the most American of Americans . The church plays a large part in the life of Indian Ridge . " W'en a town s got jest one parson , one lawyer , one doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " observed old Ezra Slack , the village patriarch , " it allus rubs along fust-rate . But w'en you get more n one of any one on em , it raises more row nor two tail-tied cats a-fightin ' each other over a clothesline . Now , we here hai n't got no s'loon , an ' p'r'aps for the matter o ' that we re jest as well off ef we hai n't . I would n't be the man to try to bring in no s'loon s ' long s we ye got our cider to hum , an ' can git whatever else we feel tile need on over to the Corners . But I m mighty darned glad we ye got one doctor an ' one lawyer an ' one parson , an ' no more nor one. ** It is at Indian Ridge as Ezra Slack says , and it surely is not the least interfor square ; also that the street scene , which is supposed to depict Washington Street , Boston , as it was a century ago , has a flaring Y. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most prominent buildinas. // esting feature of the town that it has had but one church , - never mind the denomination , - and that this church , in spite of the presence of people of various sects , has always proved an adeq*iate embodiment of its religious sentiment , and has never ceased to be a unifying rather than a disintegrating force in the community . Perhaps it is this circumstance more than any other that has helped to give the town a social symmetry almost equal to that of the French village or the retired English village which has not yet been disorganized and disquieted by the entry of dissent . However figures may be juggled with , ever and anon , to prove the contrary , there can be no reasonable doubt that church-going and respect for the church have materially decreased in New England in the course of the last half-century , at least among the Protestant population . This does not necessarily mean that religious sentiment has decreased in anything like the same degree , or even at all . It may only mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious sentiment manifests itself . The fact is that , owing to an enormous enlargement of the scope of living , religion finds a hundred means of cultivation and expression to-day where formerly it found one , the church . This will be seen to be equally true whether religion be defined as " morality touched with emotion " at one extreme , or as emotion embodied in morality at the other , or as something midway between . High aspiration must halt at cross-roads nowadays , while formerly it had only to follow a narrow but well-beaten path . It is as much because Mr. Woodsum very early recognized and approved the change that was going on in the world around him , as because he has been faithful and diligent , that he has held the allegiance not only of his parishioners , but of the whole community , during more than thirty years of work . He has often been heard to express the wish that lie were a young man just beginning his career , because of the opportunity the rising generation has for discovering and applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and declare it , to the end of building men up and making their lives of honest value to themselves and to the world . A reading , observing , and open - minded man , his thought has necessarily changed with the changing thought of his time . Like the vanguard of his generation , he has gradually become imbued with the belief ( whether right or wrong is immaterial here ) that salvation comes , not by creed and church attendance , but by character ; that good religion and good citizenship are , in the last analysis , one and the same thing ; that civic improvement and social betterment are to be agitated and toiled for rather than periodic revivals ; and that the church ( like the Sabbath ) was made for man , and not man for the church . From week to week and year to year , he has made , as it were , a report of progress to his people ; cautiously , however , and with so proper a reverence for the convictions of those who were not ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense . Thus , gently , tactfully , almost imperceptibly to themselves , he has led his people along the paths of his own thought to himself and his own way of thinking ; has grown himself , and helped them to grow with him . Now he preaches to them with general , though of course not universal acceptance , what would have aroused a storm of almost unanimous protest had he preached it as a young man , in the beginning of his work . So directed , the Indian Ridge church , besides performing the function expected of a church , has been a sort of rural college settlement , organizing or helping to organize , directly or indirectly , divers phases of the life about it for the community good* Personally , as professionally , Mr. Woodsum is a remarkable man to be located in a remote country parish . He // has a fine mastery of the theory and practice of instrumental and vocal inusie and a fair talent for painting . His execution and ideals in art , owing to his enforced absence from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paintings with which his home is hung are copies by his own hand of the favorites of that period . But the art sense and the art enthusiasm are his , just the same . He usually has as pupils a few boys and girls with a taste for the expres sion of color and form , and one would love to believe that a real art feeling has been aroused among the people in consequence . It is hardly so , I am sorry to say ; the New England nature is too resistant to aesthetic suggestion for that . A considerable feeling for landscape , however , if not much for art , has been developed in those who have come directly under the minister 's art tuition , and this is of more real worth to them , perhaps , in the long run ; it is so much more easily satisfied at Indian Ridge . Along with the rest , Mr. Woodsum is a skillful cabinet-maker . The pulpit he preaches from is his own handiwork , and he recently presented a church of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it , - a most graceful act . These his varied tastes and accomplishments have enabled him to introduce an element of beauty into his church interior and his service , though how far this is appreciated by his congregation it is difficult to say . Some years ago , Mr. Woodsum conceived the notion that a certain road out of the village needed a double row of elms . He accordingly visited the farmer whose property was adjacent ( a nonchurch-goer , by the way ) , and told him that if he would set out plenty of young elms the next fall , he would paint him a handsome sign with the legend " Elm Avenue in fancy lettering upon it . The bargain was laughingly arranged . The result is an avenue of magnificent trees that will gladden and beautify Indian Ridge long after farmer and parson have passed away . It is a simple , almost trivmal incident , but it illustrates so perfectly the attitude and the tact of the man that I have not been able to hold it back . The life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , utterly empty affair the life of a farming village is popularly supposed to be . The events that stand out are three in number : Memorial Day , the Allbright Fair , and the County Conference . When it becomes known that , in the appointed order of things , it is the turn of Indian Ridge to have the County Conference , there is great bustle of preparation , especially among the women , who devote themselves assiduously to housecleaning , dressmaking , and bonnet-trimming , as well as to mammoth cookings . When the time arrives , homes are thrown wide open for the entertainment of the delegates by all the citizens , whether church-goers or not . Hospitality of the most lavish sort is everywhere the order of the day . The Allbright Fair - Allbright adjoins Indian Ridge on the west - differs in no important respect from country fairs everywhere . There are the same horse - trots , ball - games , bicycle - races , livestock exhibits , and trials of draught horses and oxen ; the same side-shows , fakirs , freaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For days before and days after nothing else is talked of in Indian Ridge and the other towns within the Allbright radius . On Memorial Day the ceremonial is the traditional one . But the exercises have so much more significance at Indian Ridge than elsewhere that they seem to belong to an entirely different order . There is a ring to the patriotism , a poignant reality to the grief , and a lilt to the pride that lift them to the plane of high emotions . America can not easily furnish a more impressive sight than Memorial Day at Indian Ridge . I know of a man - not an old soldier , either , and not // too much of a patriot - who drove forty miles to witness the ceremonial , and felt more than repaid for his pains . As a small boy in a New England town , I always set apart Memorial Day for fishing with my chums . No Indian Ridge lad would dare think , much less commit , such sacrilege . An ancient and honorable chapter of the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its assemblings . The Town Hall is the regular meetingplace of five organizations : three societies growing out of the war ( the Grand Army of the Republic , Woman 's Relief Corps , and Sons of Veterans ) , the Good Templars , and the Grange . The Indian Ridge Dramatic Club gives , and for many years has given , frequent winter performances to a small circuit of towns wherein the cast is personally known , as well as at home . The town has a number of good singers , enough for concerts and a choral society . It has its own orchestra , a circumstance which makes dancing a cheap as well as an easily attained amusement ; in a small way at the houses , in a large way at the Town Hall , where occasional union balls are held in which three or four other towns participate . Farmers ' institutes and lectures of one sort or another occur at intervals through the winter . Thus it is that , between regular and irregular functions , the Town Hall is occupied , on an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad showing , by any means , for a town of not quite one thousaad inhabitants . Of the manly sports , hunting and fishing are constant and easily available resources , though most of the men are so conscientious about their farm work that they indulge little in them until after crops are harvested in the fall , when a good many go into the woods for a week or more on a stretch . Boys have the use of rifles , horses , and dogs , and are taught to shoot and to manage horses almost as soon as they are taught to do anything . They go on hunting and fishing expedi tions with the fathers and older brothers , and by the time they are fifteen or sixteen are expert woodsmen , almost invariably . The ordinary boy-plays , while fairly familiar to them , are decidedly overshadowed by this sharing of the sports of the elders . The one reliable , never failing resource - evenings , rainy days , and all the time - is the village store . What the caf 4 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Ridge . Newspapers and letters of common interest are there read aloud . Checkers , chess , backgammon , and , to a less degree , dominoes are in high favor . Championship series are played which sometimes consume a whole winter , in the course of which there is an infinite amount of probability casting , invidious comparison , and good-natured chaffing . Once in a way a wager is laid which sets the whole town agog . Talking , however , is the primary pastime of the store - groups . Politics , in their season , they talk , of course , and theology , though to a far less extent than the grocery tradition demands . The planting , cultivation , harvesting , and marketing of crops , the treatment of stock , the processes and prospects of lumbering , are subjects far more in vogue . These come easily first , and next the weather in its relations to them . And it must be admitted that the weather-signs are reduced to an inductive science quite as reliable for the immediate locality as the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as far removed from the platitudes of " society " on the same subject as beefsteak is from broth . Reminiscences are rife : of hunting , fishing , trapping , horse - racing , lumbering , most of all of the war , as is natural where many veterans still live , and where practically every family has its military tradition . In a word , the talk is as varied as are the interests and accomplishments of the talkers , and those are varied indeed . It // is customary to speak contemptuously , I know , of the intelligence and morale of the talk of the country grocery . The store-groups at Indian Ridge deserve no such contempt . There are intelligent men among the talkers , and some most interesting and suggestive things are said by them . The atmosphere is not as desperately provincial as might at first be supposed . If there were no other alleviating circumstance , the fact that all the old soldiers in the town have been south of Mason and Dixon 's line at least once in their lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reunions of veterans , makes it possible to take for granted a certain if not quite up to date knowledge of the big world outside and the ways of it . Jabez Lyman , a veteran , who enlisted as a boy of seventeen , and had his constitution undermined by ten months in Andersonville , has passed a large part of his winters since in Washington , or south of it , for his health 's sake . His talk abounds in sage estimates and witty observations on Southern life and character , more especially concerning the colored people . Elbridge Copeland , sixty-three years old , who recently returned from the Far West despoiled of the fifteen thousand dollars he had amassed by a quarter of a century of storekeeping in his native town , though so poor in pocket as to be forced to begin life over again by clerking on the very spot where he was once the master , is rich indeed in lore of mine and prairie , and recklessly prodigal of it . Job Preston is a capital mimic . He imitates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian , and negro . His impersonations are so perfect that they never grow stale , and he is never at a loss for tales , more or less spicy , calling his faculty into play . " Job Preston can talk the leg off an iron kettle , " was Jabez Lyman 's verdict , when I inquired for particulars about him , " and he can do that slick enough , I 11 admit ; but that s just about all he can do , and just about all he s ever done , so far as I know . " True genius unpractical here as everywhere ! Solomon Whiting devotes his leisure to collecting curios . He has a sugar-planting brother in the Sandwich Islands , who began sending him Hawaiian specimens more than thirty years ago . This was enough to give Solomon the collecting fever ; since that time , his house has been gradually transformed into a museum , and he himself into a close approach to a virtuoso . In Indian and early American antiquities his collection is peculiarly rich . Duncan McAinsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name implies , possesses a wide and accurate knowledge of English and Scottish history , partly inherited from his father , partly acquired by his own hard study . He is reluctant to ventilate his knowledge , unlike most of his neighbors ; but when he does really let himself go , it is a unique treat . He was somehow prevailed on once , more than ten years back , to give a lecture in the Town Hall . The event is still much talked about , and always with whispered and staring reverence and amaze . Samuel Wiggin is the versatile phenomenon of the village . Samuel Wiggin 's trade and nominal occupation is watch-repairing , but he supplements the rather slender income the watch-repairing of Indian Ridge provides by tuning and repairing organs and pianos ; conducting singing and dancing classes ; giving private lessons in vocal and instrumental music , water-color painting , the decoration of china , and four languages . Samuel is immoderately fond of small children , and they of him . They troop after him - much as the children of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - for the wonder-stories he loves to tell them . Surely this talent for loving and dreaming should not be reckoned least among the // many he possesses . Small wonder that Sam Wiggin has the reputation of being able to talk well upon any subject what-soever ! As if the variety were not already sufficient , an old sea-captain and a Boston policeman retired on half pay also live at Indian Ridge . Both are proud of their past and garrulous to a degree about it . Now , he is a lucky man , to my way of thinking , wherever he may be located , who has within his hand 's reach a group of people who can deal intimately with a larger range of worthy and picturesque themes . Every one is more or less aware , I suppose , through books , if not through direct observation , of the occurrence of quaint types in the New England farming town ; hardly , I fancy , of the extent to which these types are a diversion to one another and the remainder of the community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversion plays in relieving their social life from tedium . This is where the proverbial Yankee sense of humor comes in . In this respect , the stores of Indian Ridge would be to most , as they were to me , a positive revelation . Thus , Amos Cummings , keeper of the harness shop , and Levi Wilson , keeper of the grocery next door , have for years had an agreement that whenever one of them should succeed in corralling Joshua Puttengill and getting him to talk , he should summon the other . And this summons has invariably resulted in the other 's shutting up shop and devoting an hour or more to pumping old Puttengill . Josh Puttengill , you see , is the character of Indian Ridge . You would know that to look at him . No commonplace epistle was ever folded in such an envelope . In being tall , lank , and angular he is like the prevailing type around him , but his head has none of the stern characteristics of that type . Josh is a practical farmer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good common sense , - except when he is yarning ; for yarning is Josh 's specialty , - besetting sin or supreme accomplishment according to the point of view . If I have refrained from exhibiting in detail the shortcomings of the life , it is not , for that reason , to be taken for granted that there are none , or even that they are few in number . Indian Ridge has all the defects of all its qualities , and possibly some others besides . It is narrowly partisan in its politics ; gossiping and meddling in its temper towards matters of purely private concern ; religion , here as elsewhere , in spite of a general wholesomeness , is not entirely free from hypocrisy , morality from inhumanity and self - complacency , integrity from cruel hardness , nor thrift and foresight from parsimoniousness and worry . It is very little alive to the finer issues of country living ; most of them are not so much as suspected by it . For all the mutual helpfulness and abounding sense of humor , the life lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression . It is indisputably triste . Nevertheless , Indian Ridge exemplifies the best tendencies of the New England country . These tendencies , owing to its comparative isolation , have been manifested in unique and homely ways in some instances , but the tendencies are none the less sound and healthy on that account . They are present to a considerable if not an equal degree , not in all , not in the majority , perhaps , but in many of the rural communities in every one of the New England States . If all instead of a small part of these communities were even thus liberally endowed , there could be no plaint over the decadence of rural New England , for they have in them the germs of permanent progress ; rather , they are themselves the very essence of corporate life . Alvan F. Sanborn. // REAL UTOPIAS IN THE ARID WEST . THE unknown settler who built his cabin on the last free homestead in " the rainbelt " was a character of some historical importance . He closed one act in the continental drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be played in the strange setting of a region of complete aridity . Beyond the place where he had paused lay half a continent , requiring new methods and promising new institutions . Differing widely from the old land in soil and climate , in scenery and resources , the new land presented its deep and fundamental contrast in demanding irrigation as the sole condition on which an enduring civilization might flourish . The character of this civilization is revealed in communities already created by the pioneers .
