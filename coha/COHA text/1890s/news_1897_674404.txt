txt State Controller James A. Roberts will submit a report , with important recommendations , to the Legislature to-morrow evening upon the financial condition of the State . He calls attention to a vast increase in State expenditures , and recommends a graded inheritance tax  --  the largest estates to be made to pay the largest tax . The expenditures of the State during the last fiscal year , ended Sept. 30 , 1893 , aggregated the sum of $213,510,425.77 . Mr. Roberts makes the increasing expenditures for the support of the State Government his leading theme , and warns the Legislature that unless its members are economical in their appropriations of the State 's money for this or that purpose an increase of the State tax rate can not be avoided . He especially dwells on the large increase in the number of State charitable institutions , plainly as a hint that the State has done about as much in this direction as it can wisely do . He says : " In my last report to the Legislature I called special attention to the enormous proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took occasion to give prominence to the fact that unless new sources of revenue were discovered a low tax rate could never again be enjoyed by this State . A very fruitful source of income was discovered in this new excise law , which yielded to the treasury $3,504 , - 014.95 . But with this large addition to the State 's resources , a comparatively . high tax rate had to be made to provide the necessary funds to meet the ever-increasing expenditures . The tax rate last year was 2 69-100 mills en the dollar ; with three exceptions , this is the highest rate levied for the past ten years , notwithstanding the increase of over $3,504,000 in the revenue . There is danger , therefore , that unless a determined effort is made to keep down unusual and extraordinary expenditures , the increased income from the excise law may Incite a desire for appropriations , and thus raise the tax rate instead of lowering it . " Cost of Charities . The annual fixed charges against the State for the support of seventeen State charitable institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armories , twelve normal schools , three State prisons , five State canals , and the new Capitol are given as $1.5,271,218.05 . ' " This is an enormous amount of money , " says the Controller , " to squeeze from the people every year , and what is worse , the indications are it will steadily increase , let the Legislature do the best it can . In view of this , and the additional fact that this department hag information to the effect that your honorable body is to be asked for appropriations for more new institutions . I respectfully suggest that it is time to call a halt on new , unusual , and extraordinary expenditures , for a time at least , and enter upon the practice of rigid economy . " Mr. Roberts makes a suggestion regarding the inheritance tax which will doubtless arouse a wide popular discussion and be debated at length in the Legislature . His suggestion is that the inheritance tax be graded so as to weigh heaviest on the largest estates . He points to the inheritance tax systems of Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of graded tax systems , and he suggests a tax of 5 per cent , on estates of $1,000,000 and less than $2,000,000 , of 10 per cent . on estates of $2,000,000 and less than $3,000,000 , and of 15 per cent . on estates of $3,000,000 and over . Such a graded tax system , if it had been in operation in this State during the last four years , he says , would have put the sum of 427,714,500 in the State Treasury , whereas under the present system only $8,084,187.90 was paid in . The Controller says : : " It occurs to me also that it would be well for the Legislature to give very serious consideration to the question as to whether the collateral inheritance or transfer tax laws should not be materially amended so as to provide a graded scale that will make large estates yie.e very much more tax than the ? ' do now . At present an estate going to lineals , that is , heirs of the blood , pays 1 par cent. , and one going to collaterals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All estate going to lineals , real and personal , under 810,0.00 , are exempt from taxation , and only the personal property of the lineals above 510,000 is taxable . Estates of less than $500 , real and personal , going to collaterals , are exempt , but both the realty and personalty of the collateral above $300 are taxed . Bequests to domestics and religious corporations and to Bishops are exempt . It Falls on Personal Property . " It will be seen from this that a guarding of the tax is attempted in the present law , but it is a serious question whether it does not fall far short of accomplishing that which should be attained . If an estate of less than $10,000 should be exempt , why should not one millions greater pay a higher rate than a ten-thousand-dollar estate ? A large estate would certainly be less burdened by the payment of a higher rate than a small estate would be by the payment of a lesser- one . The principal burden of the inheritance tax falls upon personal property . No class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax than is personal . As a rule , it escapes taxation during the life of the owner . The equalized taxable value of real estate in this State in the year 1870 was 81,532,720,907 : in the year 1895 , the last year reported , it had reached $3,908 , - a53,377 , a gain of $2.370,132,470 , or more than 135 per cent . The equalized value of taxable personal property in 1670 was $434 , - " SO , " 78 , and in 1695 it was 84,70,8a0,326 , gain of only $25,579,248 , or less than 0 per cent . " Now it is a well-known fact that the increase in value of personal property in this State of late years has been much more rapid than of real estate , and that the amount of personal property owned here is equal to , if not more than , the amount of real estate ; yet the above figures indicate a fabulous growth in the amount of taxable real estate , while , comparatively , the increase of the amount of personal property reported for taxation purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal property now on the tax rolls is a trifle over one-ninth as much as the real estate , and only a fraction more than it was twenty-six years ago . " A significant fact bearing on this subject is that since the act imposing a tax of one-eighth of 1 per cent . for the privilege of organization was passed in 1SSG , the sum of $=4016,001,464 has been invested in the capital of corporations . This is nearly five times as much as the total amount of personal property now upon the tax rolls of the State . Where Is All This Property ? " The question is therefore , Where is all this personal . property ? It evades taxation . Tha fact is , neither the Assessor nor the taxgatherer ever gets a chance to list personal property until death intervenes and forces a balancing of accounts ; then the administrator appears , the Surrogate is visited , the will is produced , appraisers are appointed , strong boxes in bank and safe deposit vaults are opened , and hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of before are brought to light . " The opportunity for just and equitable taxation is perfect under such conditions , and why should not the State avail itself of it . particularly in view of the fact that never before could it secure the opportunity ? It has been maintained by eminent authorities that it would be wiser and less demoralizing if the Government should forego all attempt to tax personal property during the life of the owner , await a transfer following death , and then levy an assessment large enough to make up for the previous years of exemption . The tax , then , would be no hardship to any one . The decedent would have been allowed the use and enjoyment of his fortune during life , and the beneficiary would simply pay a fee for the privilege of receiving an estate , in the creation of which he had little or no hand . Against the payment of such a fee or tax he would have no reason to complain , as his ? right to receive it conies from the State , is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another reason why large estates , particularly the personal property of such estates , should be made to pay liberally toward the support of Government in the way of an inheritance tax , is because many of them owe their very existence to favors conferred by Government in one form and another . The Government throws its strong arm around the capitalist in the shape of a protective tariff ; it gives the inventor exclusive rights in the way of a patent covering a long series of years ; it gives him and his friends special privileges in the shape of a corporation charter , whereby they combine large amounts of capital , and thus conduct a vastly more successful business than they could if acting individually ; it gives them the right of eminent domain , by which they overrun the interest of the individual , whether he likes it or Mat ; it grants them limited liability as members of the corporation ; it permits them to issue bonds and borrow money on them for long periods , something an individual can not do ; it protects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil and military law ; it protects the lawyer , the doctor . and other professional men from uneducated and ' uns.killed competition by requiring a thorough course of study and a qualifying examination . " In these privileges conferred by Government lie the foundation of most of the great fortunes of the country to-day . Moreover , they are largely composed of personal property , which , as already shown , very largely escapes taxation . In justice , therefore , to the mass of small land owners and taxpayers who have from year to year borne more than their equitable share of the burden of taxation , I maintain that a transfer tax upon large estates that would make up , to a certain extent , for the years of exemption enjoyed , would be simple justice . " This whole subject , " Controller Roberts says , " is one pregnant with great import from a public and patriotic point of view , and it is respectfully submitted to the serious consideration of the Legislature . " Mr. Roberts states that on Sept. 30 , 1896 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum of $4.930,040.43 , but he warns the Legislature that most of this money has already been appropriated in advance for various purposes ; such as the construction of the Capitol . Investigations Are Expensive . Once more Mr. Roberts calls attention to the large cost of legislative investigations , and suggests that a law be passed fixing a uniform per-diem rate for the pay-s ment of the expenses of members of the Legislature when engaged on such missions . As evidence that this for committee expenses , exclusive of contested election cases . Mr. Roberts recommends that State bonds be exempted from taxation , and that the State House be converted into a State financial building , containing the offices of the Controller , the Treasurer , and the Superintendent of the Banking Department . The aggregate expenditures of the State for the support of its minor charitable institutions , he reports , was $1,020,339.02 , which is exclusive of home products and profits from manufacturing . Continuing , the Controller says : " And still another matter requiring special attention is the expenditure of public money for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence now by reason of the fact that while the Legislature is striving to find employment for the idle convicts in the State prisons , and has enacted by Chapter 429 , Laws of 189G , that , so far as practicable , the public institutions of the State shall be supplied by articles the product of prison labor ; the managers of the Northern New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes declare the law not applicable to their institution , and that they do not want to use prison-made stuff . The Attorney General informs me that they are right in their contention , for the reason that their institution is a private one . By Chapter 216 , Laws of 1887 , the sum of $40,000 was appropriated to buy a site and erect buildings for the Northern . New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes , and $37,173 has beer expended upon it since , making a total of $77,473 The fact la practically all the money required for the land and buildings has been furnished by the State , yet the title is in a private Board of Trustees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delinquents on Randall 's Island , the State has already expended ** for permanent improvements and betterments , and I understand that an appropriation of $34,120 will be asked for this year for betterments . This property is also owned by a board of private trustees . In my judgment , ? this is a mistaken public policy . If these institutions are to be steady recipients of State aid for permanent improvement , the title of the property should be transferred to the State , as was done with the immensely valuable properz.es in New York and Kings , when those counties were brought under the State Care act for the pauper insane . I would , therefore , respectfully suggest that all appropriations for these institutions other than for maintenance be withheld until the title of the property is transferred to the State . " Mr. Roberts states that there are in the Adirondack Park 2,887.000 acres of land , of which the State Own less than onequarter , or 700,0a0 acres ; and he commends the policy ' of buying lands within the Forest Preserve at reasonable rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that he is having difficulty in collecting it since the associations contend that legally they can not be taxed on the entry fees paid upon horses to be raced ; while he believes they legally should be taxed in this respect . Mr. Roberts calls attention to the great increase in the cost of the State printing , pointing out that it has increased from $05 , - 0 ' 5.51. in 1557 , to $313,585.81 , in liela Mr. Roberts recommends , in view of the large number - of defalcations by county treasurers , that their accounts he examined at short intervals by some State department . In cloeine his report , nit .. Roberts calls attention to the interesting records in his I office of the Revolutionary War , and states i that- progress has been made in arranging gird indexing Mate records .
