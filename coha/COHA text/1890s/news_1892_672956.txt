txt A large number of the Republican members of the House of Representatives were absent yesterday , and the Democrats put through a good deal of legislation under a suspension of the rules and without obstruction . One of the most important bills passed is that known as the Hatch AntiOption bill , which , under the guise of a revenue measure , is intended to put an end to the system of selling cotton , grain , and " hog products " for future delivery . The vote by which this bill was passed showed a majority of the entire membership of the House in its favor , and its support was derived largely , though . not wholly , from the Democratic members . It has been claimed that this measure is in the interest of the farmers of the country and is demanded by them . It is undoubtedly demanded by some of them , under the mistaken notion that it is in their interest , but it is evident that they neither understand the effect of the system of trading in " futures " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The system has been an evolution from the conditions of trade in the vast volume of agricultural products which make up the bulk of our exports . It was forced into existence some seventeen years ago by the necessities of the situation , and it is a device which can not now be dispensed with without disastrous consequences . By means of it the products of our yearly crops , North and South , are distributed in the domestic and foreign markets without a glut at one time and a dearth at another , and without the wide and ruinous fluctuation in prices which would occur if these products had in all cases to be bought and paid for before they could be sold . It facilitates immensely the collection , . transportation , and distribution of these voluminous products of the country and all the financial operations based upon them , and makes possible contracts and calculations which could not otherwise exist . Its principal effect upon prices is to make them steady and more nearly uniform than they would otherwise be , without depressing or elevating their general level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so largely produced and consumed and so widely bought and sold will inevitably be determined by the law of supply and demand and can not be changed by any dev4ce for the regulation of the operations of trade . Not only is the Anti-Option bill a mischievous measure , based upon wholly erroneous views of trade , but it is entirely inconsistent with what have been known as essentially Democratic doctrines . It has often been contended that tariff legislation , the purpose and effect of which was not to raise revenue for the Government but to restrict foreign trade and increase prices for domestic products , was not constitutional , but it has been defended on the ground that Congress had power to regulate foreign commerce and that the so-called protection of home industry was " incidental " to the raising of revenue . But this measure , which requires a heavy license fee and a still heavier tax for the class of transactions with which it deals , is not intended to raise any revenue at all . Its form as a revenue measure is sheer disguise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose is to prevent these transactions altogether . This is an exercise of power by Congress which has no constitutional sanction and is opposed to all Democratic professions as to public policy . It is a direct interference by the Government with private business management and methods , and a pernicious restriction , indirectly upon foreign and inter-State commerce , but directly upon domestic trade at the various Exchanges of the country . Its intention is to legislate directly in favor of one class against another , while its effect would be to injure the very class it professed to benefit . There could be no worse form of " centralization " or of " paternalism " in the exercise of the powers of the Government , and there could be no more glaring instance of their exercise beyond the limits of constitutional sanction , and its support by Democrats in and . out of Congress only shows how readily the professed principles of a party are laid aside at the demand of what is imagined to be the expediency of the moment .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
