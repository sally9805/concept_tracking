It would take but a short time to reach the wealth of Croisus with a prosperous goose ranch at one 's back . Goose farming is now the popular fad in Washington . Mon are awakening from their slumbers to realize that herding geese may be more profitable than selling liquor to Indians in some back county , staking out mining claims , or raising No. 1 wheat . The only wonder is that men have been so long discovering the untold wealth of " down " and goslings . This , the latest of Washington 's industries , bids fair to eclipse all efforts heretofore tried of amassing a fortune in a few years frym a quarter section of land . Among the first to take advantage of the new discovery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arguments of lawyers and the decisions of courts all Spring , for he has been a worthy jurymen in the Superior Court panel , but at last he has left the jury box behind and has betaken himself to the green fields of . Northern Oregon to equip and maintain a goose ranch . preparatory to establishing another on his Washington ranch . According to the story of the expert whose mellow talk caught Farmer Parker , there 's barrels of money in keeping a goose ranch . Before a Man makes the venture , however , a capital of $1,006 , is necessary . This being secured , the intending goose farmer goes to Kansas or some other State where goslings are plentiful and makes his purchase of , say , 1,000 geese . For these he pays $400 . To save the transportation of this number of fowls to Washington , his next move would be to a harness maker to have the geese shod .

Barney Quinn , Court Bailiff , has demonstrated the theories to be facts by practical experience , and had it not been for circumstances over which he had no control , Mr. Quinn would today be owner of myriads of these feathered treasures , but , as it was , they met with an accident and died , which Barney relates as follows : Several years ago 1 ventured into the gooseraising business in Colorado . I purchased 1,000 geese In Kansas , had them shod , and drove them all the way to Northern Colorado . I was happy with my lot until the cold weather set le , and one by one my gooselets faded .

I 'll never forget what a beautiful sight it was to gaze from my cabin window moonlight nights and look upon my sea of gooselets with their little red coverings . It was a grand sight , Sir , but the cold weather was too much for them . and I lost nearly 300 . Then I made up my mind to go to New-Mexico with my flock , where it was warmer . I had their shoes put on and off I started . Through the entire length of the State of Colorado I trudged . my feathered tribe and I. It was a tedious journey , but the sight of my herd nerved me and I dreamed of golden success when I reached New-Mexico . Then I came to the Rio Grande River .
