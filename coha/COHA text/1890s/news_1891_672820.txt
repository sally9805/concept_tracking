txt We do not ' , mow how many of the members of the Fifty-second Congress are in the habit of reading the Forum regularly . We fear that the number is , not as large as it ought to be , considering the success of that review in getting contributions from competent writers on fina-noial and political subjects . But the busiest of ? Congressmen might afford the time to read the two pages in the January number in which Mr. GEORGE S. COE , President of the American Exchange Bank of this city , gives his reasons " why the silver law should be repealed/ ' Mr. Con is not only an accomplished , successful , and greatly-trusted banker , but he is a student of banking and of the-vast interests with which banking in these days is concerned , and he is a thinker of rare penetration and power of careful and accurate generalization . Probably there is no one in his calling who has a clearer **28;29;TOOLONG practical knowledge of theprincipies-of his business , which , as we have intimated , is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no one who is in any degree responsible for the - financial legislation-of-the country anything but good to examine the views of - such a man , based entirely on his " own experience and observation and with no reference to any political consideration whatever . Examining the legal-tender notes issued under-the act of 1890 ; andconsidering in what they are lobe redeemed , Mr. Con finds that the holder " can get back only silver coins containing &uniform; but much smaller amount of silver than the market value in bullion given for them , and therefore - the notes are not redeemed at cost . " And then he asks : " Is the currency so created a natural and intrinsically-sound and healthful one , that invariably promotes the transmission and just distribution of values-among the people , and certain to be redeemed under all circumstances at its full commercial equivalent Vi Of ? course it is not . Redemption in the coin described is not such redemption . The accumulated notes tend to drive out gold , and then the only alternative is redemption in gold to be got by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , " says the banker , " is it reasonable for a Government to continue in operation a law whose natural tendency is to produce each results , and then seek to repair the damage thus unnecessarily done by entering its credit in competition with that of other Governments in Europe for the recovery of gold so lost I " Of course , again , it is not . Why , then , not repeal the law There is no answer based on financial principle . There can be none . The only reason why the repeal of the law will be resisted is political and partisan . The law was passed to save the silver vote to the Republican Party . The leaders of that party will not consent to its repeal , or propose it , until they have made up their minds to abandon - the silver vote . Even then the Democrats in the House would not consent to it . We must get on with the law as best we can for at least a couple of years longer . But in the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by men of such high authority as Mr. Con , are noteworthy because they are educating.
