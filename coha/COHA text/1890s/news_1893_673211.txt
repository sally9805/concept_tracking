txt An investigation by a Nnw-Your Tnuns reporter shows that the mail robbery recently committed upon Long Island was of much greater magnitude than any one outside of the United States postal authorities had supposed . It was not the registered mail for Babylon , L. I. , that was plundered , as at first reported by the authorities , but the entire Long Island registered mail in transit somewhere between Long Island City and the New-York Post Office . It is understood that , the missing clerk , as was his duty , received from each mail clerk , upon the arrival of their trains in Long Island City , the registered mail in their possession . The trains bringing in such mail were six in. number , one each from Babylon , Sag Harbor , Greenport , Oyster Bay , Great Neck , and Port Jefferson ; in other words , the trains were from every section of the railroad upon the island . The registered Mail collected along each route is placect in a large envelope by the train clerk , who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Long Island City , taking a receipt for " one package , " irrespective of the number of inclosuros . In addition to these six packages received from Mr. Fitch , transfer clerk at Long Island City , a package containing fifteen registered letters collected from the smaller near-by . suburban offices not directly upon the railroad . It is said that when this package reached New-York it contained but three of the fifteen letters . One valuable letter from Oyster Bay is missing also . The packages were all duly delivered to the New-York office and receipted for , but in each instance some of the contents had been abstracted . The plot was discovered through the loss of the Oyster Bay letter . The Postmistress there sent in her returns to the New-York office , and these returns called for a registered letter , which was not found at the New-York end , and a prompt inquiry followed . Had the clerk failed to appear as usual at the New-York office at his customary hour , a general alarm would have been sent out and the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packages in the regular way , with just a sufficient number of inclosures to avert suspicion , he got fully twenty-four hours ' start , and his capture still remains to be effected . was appointed mail clerk under the usual civil service rules about a year ago , and until recently was train clerk upon the Great Neck or North Shore route . Ho was popular with his fellows , and had the confidence of his superiors . He is said to have possessed decidedly erratic habits , and generally reported ill for two or three days after each pay day . Naturally enough , the United States authorities are anxious to find Mr. and have a confidential conversation with him , but thus far he has eluded them with great skill . Inspector James of the New-York office is exercised over the leaking of the news on Monday , despite his efforts at both ends of the line to keep thematter a profound secret . He threatens with instant dismissal any clerk or other employe who divulges the least information to any person . In consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office to Montauk Point , the search for knowledge upon this remarkable affair was beset with difficulties . The amount of the losses is problematical . It is not likely that the authorities could tell if they would , but a careful estimate places the loss at $5,000.
