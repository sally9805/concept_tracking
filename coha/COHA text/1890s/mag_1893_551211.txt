REVOLUTION . By George H. Martin . THE founders of Massachusetts , in their theory of education , were in line with the foremost of the reformers ; and this line was far in advance of the existing practice at the time of their expatriation . Universal opportunity for education was the utmost that even the charitable founders of the endowed schools aimed to secure by their gift . The Massachusetts Puritans went further , and decreed universal education ; but when they came to provide the means for such education , they set up such schools as they had been familiar with . I3ryce has said : " Everything which has power to win the obedience and respect of men must have its roots deep in the past . " As the student of our political institutions is struck by the fact that their founders broke with the past so little , the student of our educational history observes the same fact , and finds that the early schools of New England are studied best in Old England . When the lawmakers of 1647 spoke of grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , and these were such as they had been educated in at home . Winthrop came from Groton , in Suffolk . At Bury St. Edmunds , close by , was a free grammar school founded by Edward in 1553 ; at Eye , in the same county , was one founded before 1556 ; while at Sudbury there was another , founded by one William Wood , a year before Columbus discovered America . John Cotton came from Old Boston . There was a free grammar school , and Cotton , a few years before , had been one of a committee to select an usher for it . Endicott , of Salem , came from Dorchester . There was a school founded in 1579 : " A free school with a learned master , for children of all degrees . " Dudley , of Roxbury , came from Northampton . There was a school founded 356 in 1541 , to teach boys who desired to learn , freely . Hooker , of Cambridge , who led his flock through the wilderness to the Connecticut , came from Chelmsford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good Edward 's free grammar schools , founded in * At Halstead and Colchester , too , in the same county , were similar schools . From the neighborhood of these came most of the early settlers of Cambridge . In view of these facts it is amusing to read in Mr. Douglas Campbell 's book on the Puritans , that in the absence of any schools the Massachusetts Puritans must have educated themselves and their children . The statement is frequently made that Massachusetts , by its law of 1647 , established a system of free public schools , the first in the world . However gratifying such statements might be to our local pride , and our pride of ancestry , candor compels us to declare that it is not true . Our fathers did establish a system of schools ; they were public schools , and many of them were free schools ; but , paradoxical as it may seem , there was at first no system of free public schools . Schools had been begun in nearly all the towns before r647 , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With perhaps a single exception , these were all public schools - the people 's schools . The initiative was taken by the people as citizens - taken in town meeting , and recorded in the town records . The town voted to have the school ; the town determined the grade of the school ; the town chose the master and fixed his compensation ; the town , through its officers , inducted him into office and arranged all the details of the school econony . This was all done as a matter of convenience , not of right ; not at all with // any conscious reference to any theory of local autonomy . It is important to dwell upon this point . There has grown up an exaggerated notion of the rights of towns , especially in regard to schools . In Massachusetts , towns have no rights , and never had any , save such as have been conferred by statutes . De Tocqueville , in his study of American democracy , was deceived by appearances into seeing an analogy between the Federal Union and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregation of units - the towns being the units , as the Federation is an aggregation of States . This is not true , legally or chronologically . The towns were not first settled , then grouped into the State . The State was first , as a legal entity . The territory was the territory of the State , and the supreme authority was in the State . Instead of the towns being the source of power , and delegating power to the State , as the State has done to the United States , the towns are but creations of the State , and under its sanction " live and move and have their being . " The State , or the General Court which was the State , deemed the towns most suitable agents to carry out its policy of universal education . The towns were required to provide schools , as they were required to provide churches , and to keep watch and ward against the Indians . While the schools were thus public schools , their peculiarly English character is most strongly marked in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uniformity , and we are impressed by the fact that at first direct taxation for their support was the least prominent feature . Of seven grammar schools established before 1647 , no two were supported in just the same way . In Boston there was first a subscription by the wealthy citizens , Sir Henry Vane and Governor Winthrop heading the paper ; then there was the income from leased town lands ; then incomes from funds left by will to the school ; and lastly , when there was not enough from all these sources to make up the master 's salary of fifty pounds , a town rate was levied for the balance . There is nowhere any reference to tuition fees . Of Cambridge , we read in " New England 's First Fruits , " " And by the side of the college a fair grammar school for the training up of young scholars and fitting them for academical learning that still as they are judged ripe they may be received into the college . " This school seems to have been supported wholly by tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an appropriation by the Commissioners of the United Colonies , to pay for the instruction of some Indian youths . But in 1648 , the school being small and the master 's income consequently scanty , the town sold some land for his benefit ; and six years later levied a rate to help him out . In Charlestown three sources of income are apparent , - the rent of some islands , the income from the Mystic weir , and a rate . In Dorchester there was the income from leased lands on Thomson 's Island , which the General Court had given to the town , and there were bequests by generous people . There is nothing at first to indicate either tuition fees or a town rate . It was purely an endowed school , but endowed by the people themselves . In Salem parents subscribed , as they were able and felt disposed , and the town by rate provided for the children of the poor . In Ipswich the grammar school was supported by income from rents , lands , annuities , and tuition fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still some school income from these ancient leases . In Roxbury the grammar school was never public ; the wealthier inhabitants founding the school , binding their estates for its perpetual support , only their own children receiving the benefit of the school freely . In all these cases the town rate , the general tax , was used only to supplement the other sources of income ; to eke out otherwise too scanty resources . There seems to have been no objection to the rate , but the people naturally followed the customs with which they had been familiar at home . School lands , school funds , and school fees were traditional ideas , so they started in the old way and in many // cases continued in that way for more than a century . Dedham early in its history - in 1644 - set up a free school , and built a house for it , and supported it by a general tax . It furnished elementary instruction in English , writing , and the art of arithmetic . The tax was levied semi-annually , and the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in corn . In extreme xveather the master was permitted to keep the school in his own house , and in the heat of summer he might use the meeting-house , on condition that he left it clean and mended all the windows that his boys broke . But the conditions in New England tended to make the school everywhere , sooner or later , wholly free and supported by tax . Common lands , available as sources of town income , were gradually sold . Population increased more rapidly than the income from testamentary properties , so that the needs of the schools , in most instances , outran their fixed revenues . Private benevolence lacked incentive when law made schools compulsory , and a town rate could be depended upon to provide means for their support . Tuition fees from the rich , and free tuition for the poor , made class distinctions too prominent in a new society , wherein Church and State all were equal . Support by town rate was simpler , easier , and more uniform than by any other method . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the English schools to American schools as we know them to-day . The change came more rapidly in some cases than in others . Each locality worked out its own problem in its own way , until all at last reached the same result under the law , which made support by town rate permissible , but not compulsory . When this result had been reached- about the middle of the second century - Massachusetts stood alone in the world . Excepting New Hampshire , which was so closely identified with Massachusetts as to be thought of with it , no other State in the Union had a free school system . Connecticut had public schools , but they were not free till later . New York had no public school system and had no free school system for a century . The European systems furnished free schooling only to the poor . It is significant that in many of the towns the grammar school was the first to be established . Until recently it had been supposed that corporate provision for elementary education was the exception , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such education was general . Sometimes English was taught in grammar schools . This seems to have been so at first in Boston , an usher being appointed for the purpose , after the English fashion . In Ipswich an English school was coeval with the grammar schools ; this was chiefly for older children . In Charlestown , Watertown , and Dedham , we know that elementary instruction was furnished from the beginning . In a contract with a teacher for the Roxbury grammar school , the master covenants " to use his best skill and endeavour , both by precept and example , to instruct in all scholastical , moral , and theological discipline the children of the proprietors of the school - all A-B-Cdarians excepted . " It seems to have been generally understood that children would be taught to read before attending the grammar schools . Very early there appeared that other English institution so familiar , so closely associated with memories of childhood , - the dame school ; and before many years this was made a part of the public school system . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the larger towns , during the first century of colonial existence , through his pupilage . At four or five years of age , clinging to the fingers of some older brother or sister , he toddles away from his own dooryard to the humble cottage where the road to learning was supposed to begin . It was such as Crabbe described " Where a deaf , poor , patient widow sits And awes some thirty infants as she knits ; Infants of humble busy wives who pay Some trifling price for freedom through the day . At this good matron 's hut the children meet , Who thus becomes the mother of the street . Her room is small , they can not widely stray , Her threshold high , they can not run away . With band of yarn she keeps offenders in , And to her gown the sturdiest rogues can pin . " // Suspended by a string from the wall is the single object which was in embryo all that our Massachusetts statutes now designate by the phrase " text-books and supplies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote . In " Love 's Labor Lost , " the schoolmaster , Holofernes , is proved to be " lettered " because he teaches the boys the hornbook . This first round in learning 's ladder consisted of a card set in a frame , having printed on it the Roman alphabet , capitals and small letters ; below , the vowels , large and small ; then the familiar Ab , Eb , Tb , etc. ; following these the benediction : " The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost , be with you all evermore . Amen . " Then came the Lord 's Prayer , and sometimes , at the bottom , the Roman numerals . The whole was covered with a thin , translucent sheet of horn , to preserve it . So Shenstone describes it : - " Their books of stature small they take in hand , Which with pellucid horn secured are , To save from fingers wet the letters fair . " Prior describes a more pleasing form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English maid A hornbook gives of gingerbread ; And that the child may learn the better , As he can name he eats the letter . " The good &amp;ime , as she knits or sews or spins , listens to each child in turn as he calls the letters in their order . She entertains him with stories from the Bible , and strives with moral precepts to bring him up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . The older children have brought from home their primers , in the earliest days made in England , but after i 66o for nearly two hundred years printed nearly everywhere in New England ,  --  the famous New England Primer . The first edition was plain , but soon and always afterward illustrated with cuts . This little book was a perfect vade mecum of what the Roxbury trustees called " scholastical , theological , and moral discipline . " Beginning with the alphabet , large and small , the vowels and consonants and combinations of these , there followed lists of words for spelling : first of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then of five ; ending with abominalion , /us/*flcadon , etc . Then followed some moral injunctions : " Pray to God , " " Hate lies " ; then some Bible questions and answers , " Who was the first man ? " then selections from the Proverbs , arranged alphabetically , " A wise son , " etc. ; then the Lord 's Prayer , the Apostles ' Creed , Watt 's Cradle Hymn ; then miscellaneous hymns , " Now I lay me , " etc . Proper names of men and women , for spelling , followed ; then Agur 's prayer , " Give me neither poverty nor riches " ; last , the Westminster Shorter Catechism , so called . I remember when , a child , I was compelled to learn it , I wondered what a longer one could be like . The poetical selections varied in different editions ; so did the pictures : the frontispiece in some was a child repeating his evening prayer at his mother 's knee ; in others , several children standing before the mother , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A primer printed in 1777 has a portrait of John Hancock , president of the American Congress . All have a series of cuts illustrating prominent Bible scenes , each with a couplet condensing the narrative , as ,  --  " In Adam 's fall We sinned all . " A picture of John Rogers at the stake was another cheerful feature , with the nine small children and one at the breast and some editions had a long metrical posthumous address to his children . The whole was called " An Easy and Pleasant Guide to the Art of Reading , " a title , by the way , which has been applied to every primer published since . The primer mastered , by dint of much persuasion , and at the cost of many tears , the boys are now too large to be longer restrained by bands of yarn or to be pinned to the good matron 's apron . They are seven or eight years old , and the Latin school opens its doors to them , but not to the girls . Their education is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys bring to the master 's school a Psalter and a Bible : they will need no other English books ; they will read these every day till they go to // college . They will cipher , too , a little . The master will dictate a problem , and the boys will work on it till they dig it out . But this work is only incidental : this is a grammar school , and Latin grammar is the be-all and the end-all . Master Cheever , of New Haven , has made a little book , " A Short Introduction to the Latin Tongue . " It is known as " Cheever 's Accidence , " and the New England people - always favoring home productions , and always furnishing a home market for the best- printed eighteen editions of this before the Revolution . We are to fancy our Latin School boys , in the earlier days , in the master 's house , working their way through " Cheever 's Accidence , " then plunging into the dreary wilderness of " Lilly 's Grammar , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genders , its fifteen solid pages of rules for gender and the exceptions , its twenty-two solid pages of declensions of nouns ; all of which must be committed to memory , not at the point of the bayonet , but at the end of the ferule . Cotton Mather says : " Persisting in the use of Lilly 's book will prolong the reign of the ferule . " For reading Latin the boys had first " The Colloquies of Corderius , " whose name had a sweet savor to the New England worthies , for Corderius had been Calvin 's tutor and a famous teacher in the schools of the reformers . They read Aesop , too . Then followed Eutropius , his short history of Rome . Soon they began the making of Latin , using exercise books ; then , in turn , C*sar , Ovid , Virgil , and Cicero ; for Greek , the grammar and the Testament , and some Homer . All this was to fit them for the University , as the law required . The University fixed its requirements for admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tully , or any other such-like classical author at sight , and correctly , and without assistance to speak and write Latin both in prose and verse , and to inflect exactly the paradigms of Greek nouns and verbs , has a right to expect to be admitted into the college , and no one may claim admission without these qualifications . " So much classical knowledge every town of a hundred families was to provide , and by a law of 1683 a town of five hundred families must have two such schools and two writing schools . It was a long and dreary road , - seven or eight hours a day , with scanty recesses , few holidays , and no vacations ; only benches without backs for the lower classes . It was a long , steady , persistent pull up hill . It meant dogged industry , persistent application , resignation to the inevitable . A child who had begun with learning in his primer the definition of " Effectual Calling , " and had followed this by committing Lilly 's Grammar , had acquired no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work " with a capital W , and to print it in italics . If the boys , quickly succeeding each other , came into these New England homes " trailing clouds4 of glory , " surely " the shades of the prison-house " began early to close about them , and before they became men they must have perceived " the visions splendid die away , and fade into the light of common day . " One peculiarity of all these schools we may notice in passing . The boys were obliged to find fuel in winter : so much was required even in the schools called free , and it was declared by the authorities that if any parents neglected to send wood , their children should have no benefit of the fire , and if they sent log wood , the boys must cut it up . The teachers of the earlier schools were men , - and men of no ordinary capacity and experience . Some of them had been clergymen . All were scholars , and most of them had been educated at old Cambridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear fruit , to the honor of the pious Harvard , its graduates found places in the schools as well as in the churches . Brother Philemon Pormort , who was first called to the Boston school , seems to have been an active participant in the theological discussions of the Anne Hutchinson controversy , and followed her adherents to the infant settlements in New Hampshire . It required intellectual capacity of no mean order to handle one 's self in that tempest , and an associate of Mistress Hutchinson with her mystic // speculations , of Vane with his youthful fervor , and John Cotton with his subtle dialectic , must have been worthy to stand at the head of the long line of Massachusetts schoolmasters . His successor , Daniel Maude , had been a non-conformifig preacher in England , and after a few years service in the Boston school , resumed his ministry at Dover . Pre-eminent among all the teachers of the early schools , pre-eminent among the New England teachers of all times , stands Ezekiel Cheever , a ripe , consummate flower of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sojourning in Leyden , a blue-coat boy at Christ 's Hospital , he came to Boston in 1637 ; taught for more than thirty years , in New Haven , Jpswich , and Charlestown ; then , in 1670 , took the Boston Latin School , which he taught for thirty-eight years , until he died at his post at the age of ninety-four , after continuous service in the New England schools of seventy years . He was buried from his schoolhouse ; was followed to the grave by the governor and all the dignitaries of Church and State ; was eulogized in a sermon and elegy by his pupil , Cotton Mather , as no schoolmaster was ever eulogized before or since . " Ink is too vile a liquor , " said the great preacher in his elegy ; " liquid gold should fill the pen by which such things are told . " That he was a good Latin scholar his little book proves ; used for more than a century throughout the colonies . Mather says - " Were grammar quite extinct , yet at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are indications that he was in sympathy with Ascham and Milton in their efforts to advance education . He was more patient with the slow boys , less severe and brutal with all boys , than schoolmasters of the age were wont to be . He never sunk the man and the Christian in the pedagogue . Full to the brim with Puritan theology ,  --  he wrote a book called " The Scriptural Prophecies Explained , " - he labored diligently to help his boys to become Christian men . " He taught us Lilly , and he Gospel taught . " So , after training up a whole generation of Boston 's sons , he was gathered to his rest , full of years and full of honors . Making all allowance for Mather 's ostentatious grandiloquence , we to-day in this city , whose character he did so much to mould , revere his memory as that of a wise , learned , pious , faithful schoolmaster . As Aristotle said of Plato , " He was one whom all good men ought to imitate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that all the early masters were like Cheever ; but they were all scholarly after the fashion of the times , and all deeply imbued with that religious spirit which characterized the Puritan epoch . Their whole training tended to this . Their college studies were the studies of a divinity school . There was some mathematics ,  - -  arithmetic and geometry ; some natural science ,  --  physics and astronomy . All the rest was along the line of the humanities . Grammar , and logic , and rhetoric ; politics and ethics ; Chaldee , Hebrew , and Syriac ; Biblical and catechetical divinity , - all this wealth of learning was at the service of the children . There is another feature of these schools which must be noticed . They were under the constant and vigilant supervision of the ministers . The minister was a town officer , as the teacher was . He was employed for the religious instruction of the people , and the children were a most important part of his charge ; so he visited the school regularly ; sometimes he *uestioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he regularly examined them in the catechism , and in their knowledge of the Bible . Sometimes the children were required to go to him for this purpose . The ministers regarded this relation not only as a duty but as a right . When , in i 710 , the Boston people chose five men as inspectors to visit the Latin School with the ministers , although the ministers were to pray with the scholars and " entertain them with some instructions of piety specially adapted to their age and education , " Increase Mather was highly incensed at the innovation , and after declaring that the ministers were the fittest persons in the // world to be the visitors of the schools , pettishly declared that he would not go with the lay inspectors , but would go when he pleased , and would go alone . So the children were perpetually enveloped , at home and at school , weekdays and Sundays , in an atmosphere saturated with religion , or with religious forms , and services , and ideas , and language . When a neighbor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Samuel and Betty and Hannah - into the carriage , and drives away to the funeral , two or three hours long , that no opportunity be lost to impress upon them the solemn verities of life and death , and the grave and the hereafter . When , after patient search , he finds that the cause of the stoppage of the water-spout on the roof was the lodging in it of a ball , he sends for the minister and has a season of prayer with his boys , that their . mischief or carelessness may be set in its proper light , and that the event may be sanctified to their spiritual good . Powers of darkness and of light were struggling for the possession of the soul of every child ; there was no time to lose . Every opportunity must be improved by parents , ministers , and teachers to pluck the children as brands from the burning . Hell with its physical torments , heaven with its no less selfish allurements , stood always in their sight with open doors ; and the cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song of the redeemed and the music of harpers harping with their harps . If it sometimes happened that the very attempt to make the child religious defeated itself ; that the imagination , strained to too high a flight , lost its power to fill with meaning the formulas of doctrine ; that familiarity with the solemn and awful deadened the sensibilities to spiritual influences , so that character and conduct remained unchanged in spite of the religiosity of the age , it was only what might have been expected . I remember visiting a high school and being shocked by the general irreverence and disorder during the opening exercises of devotion . To my surprise the first class exercise which followed was one on Christian Evidences . When once a committee was appoiated to see if the instruction at Harvard remained true to its earliest motto , For Christ and the Church , they reported that the Greek Catechism was recited regularly by the freshmen , and that Wollebius 's System of Divinity was diligently pursued by the other classes , while on Saturday evening , in presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing Sabbath . " Yet the committee are compelled to lament the continued prevalence of several immoralities , particularly stealing , lying , swearing , idleness , picking of locks , and too frequent use of strong drink . " From all which we learn a les*son for our own times : that an education directed by the clergy , environed by ecclesiastical sanctions , breathing the atmosphere of ecclesiastical rites , and making instruction in ecclesiastical dogma imperative , is not necessarily a religious education , and holds no necessary relation to the development of Christian character . In the smaller towns , which were not required to maintain a school , or at most only the English school , the opportunities for education were less favorable . In some of them no town school was kept during the earlier years of settlement , the parents instructing the children at home or employing some man or woman who was willing for a few pence a week to start the children in the primer and the Psalter . There is a tradition in one town that the children learned to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week each by all the men who could read . Often the minister added to his other duties the work of teaching , especially the teaching of Latin in the towns which had no grammar school . This seems to have been universally the case in the Plymouth Colony . The Old Colony , less populous and less wealthy than the Bay , made no public provision for schools for fifty years after its settlement , though schools of some sort were early in existence . In 1663 the General Court proposed unto the several towns of its jurisdiction , as a thing they ought to take into their serious consideration , that some course may be taken that in every town there may be a schoolmaster set up to train up children to reading and // writing ; but the towns seem to have taken little notice of the suggestion . In 1670 the profits from the Cape Cod fisheries were set apart for a free school , and a grammar school was soon after established at Plymouth . Seven years later , thirty years after the Massachusetts law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to have a grammar school , to support it partly by rate , and required towns of seventy families which had no such school to pay a fixed sum to the nearest town which had one . By the same act the profits of the fisheries were divided among the towns supporting such schools . The threefold method of support is here fixed by law : fixed revenues , tuition fees , and a town rate . From this time onward the educational history of the two colonies is one . As we enter upon the eighteenth century , after seventy years of colonial history , we feel that the atmosphere has changed . There is less enthusiasm for learning than the first settlers had . There is a manifest decline in school spirit . This is apparent in both the legislation and in the records of the county courts . In the re-enactment of the colonial laws , which took place soon after the reorganization of the government under the Province Charter , the penalty upon the towns for neglecting to provide a schoolmaster was fixed at /io . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school law was shamefully neglected by divers towns , and the penalty thereof not required , tending greatly to the nourishment of ignorance and irreligion , whereof grievous complaint is made , " the General Court increased the penalty to /20 . It would seem that not infrequently the towns , to evade the law , had appointed the minister to be the schoolmaster . To meet this , it was enacted that no minister of any town should be considered the schoolmaster within the intent of the law . At the same time all justices of the peace and all grand juries in the counties were enjoined to special vigilance in the execution of the law . Following this enactment , at almost every session of the court some town is " presented " by the grand jury for neglecting to maintain the schools required by law . This is especially true regarding the grammar school , which came to be considered an unnecessary burden by towns which had just reached the number of families which made the support compulsory . Various excuses were offered for the neglect ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized efforts were not wanting to secure a repeal of the law . Some towns persistently refused to support the grammar school , preferring to pay the penalty as cheaper . To meet these cases the penalty was heavily increased a few years later . To one familiar with the early history of our State , this decadence of the primitive ardor does not seem strange . It would seem more strange had the high level been maintained ; for during these seventy years the little bark of State had been tossed on troubled waters . The educational history of Massachusetts is projected on a sombre background . Scarcely had the colonists become settled in their new homes along the bay , before dissensions among themselves brought the whole enterprise into hazard , - dissensions so sharp , differences of opinion so radical , as to reach down to the bed rock both of their civil and ecclesiastical foundations . The agitation of these controversies had scarce subsided when new clouds appeared along their English horizon . The banished dissenters carried back to England exaggerated stories of Massachusetts intolerance and independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their suit , and they would have lost their charter , and with it all possibility of building the structure they had planned , had not Charles been more concerned to save his crown than to crush the colony . Thus the second decade went by . The rule of the Parliament promised a period of peace , but a new trouble arose , and the third decade found the people stirred over the Quaker invasion . Hardly were these sad days over when the Restoration brought new political dangers , and for the next thirty years the leaders in the State were taxing their ingenuity to the utmost to avert the blow which // fell at last when their cherished charter was annulled , and they were left to the tryanny of Andros and his myrmidons . During this same period heavier calamities had fallen upon them , in the terrible struggle known as King Philip 's War . Four years of anxious solicitude were followed by fourteen months of continuous and unmitigated horror . As the messengers came in quick succession to the patriarch Job , each telling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so from north , east , south , and west , every day , sometimes almost every hour , brought news of villages burned and their inhabitants massacred , or of the troops sent to their rescue ambushed and butchered . From one end of the colony to the other , the people in their dreams heard the war-whoop of the savages , the crackling of flames , and saw the tomahawk and the scalping knife doing their bloody work . Happy were they if they were not wakened to the reality . When all was over , more than half a million dollars had been spent ; thirteen towns had been destroyed ; six hundred buildings burned , and six hundred men , the flower of the colony , had been killed . Some towns were so impoverished that their share of the colony tax was remitted . Only six years later , and the gloom of the witchcraft delusion settled like a pall over the province ; and swift upon the heels of this calamity came the war with the French , with Sir William Phipps 's disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier settlements on the north and east . Such is the record of these first seventy years , and in them all not one without some danger or some menace of danger . When some one was asked what he did during the French Revolution , he replied , " I lived . " It was much that the schools of Massachusetts lived through the trying vicissitudes of this first period . With the close of Queen Anne 's War the province entered upon a new epoch , which brought with it changes in the school system , whose influence we have not yet outlived . In the early days the fear of Indian invasion had served to hold the settlers somewhat closely together ; indeed , in a part of the towns , as in Dedham , the people were forbidden to build beyond a fixed distance of one or two miles from the meeting-house . But now that this danger seemed to be over , the people begin to push out into the wilderness . Outlying portions of the older towns were occupied , and new settlements made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns were incorporated ; while during the next ten years , forty-five more , chiefly west of the Connecticut , were incorporated . Many of these new towns had no nucleus of population , no village centre , the farming settlers *scattering themselves widely . In others there were several nuclei , larger or smaller , the people grouping themselves in isolated hamlets , where a fertile spot in the midst of rocks and swamps , a mill privilege , or a fish weir tempted them to settle . Sometimes family ties led a father and son , or brothers to locate near each other . Sometimes mere social instinct , the desire for neighbors , brought several families into propinquity . In all these towns , new and old , the school problem presented itself under new conditions in this second century , and the people solved it in their usual hand-to-mouth way , with no calculating of consequences . All the children were to be taught to read , and every town was to have a school . It is probable that there was less capacity for home instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women whose names appear in the recorded deeds of the early part of the eighteenth century , either as grantors of property or as relinquishing dower , less than forty per cent sign their names ; all the others make their mark . So we begin to read in the records of " moving schools . " Whether the mountain went to Mohammed , or Mohammed to the mountain , depends on which was the mountain and which was Mohammed . The children went no longer to the schools ; the school went to the children . At first the towns voted that the school , which had been kept through the year in one place , be kept for a part of the year in each of several places ; sometimes the // period was equal in each place , sometimes very unequal . Thus , in Scituate , the school was to be kept one third at each end and one third in the middle . So at Amesbury , four months in each of three places . In Yarmouth the school time for five places varied from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns schooling was still more scanty , as in Sutton , where a school to teach the children to read and write English was ordered , to be kept at the discretion of the selectmen in four places , one month in each . Not only was the English school thus put on wheels , but in many places the grammar school as well . In Gloucester the grammar-school instruction for three years was divided among seven localities in the proportion , nine , four and a half , three , one and a half , seven , five and a half , and five and a half months . One month and a half of the grammar school in three years - what a boon ! But these far-away people paid their taxes and demanded their share of the benefits , though their share be ever so small . They would have justice , though the heavens fall . The child who began his Latin grammar and spent his six weeks on it , would have run some risk of forgetting his part before the three years came round ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which those who cared to do so might follow the school on its travels and , like the English drum-beat in Webster 's metaphor , " keep company with the hours throughout the year . " In the earlier apportionment of the school 's time the terms " angles " and " squadrons " are used for the divisions of the town . The expression " to squadron out the schools " is not an uncommon one . Afterward these names were superseded by the word " districts . " When this division of the school time was made , and in many towns for a long period , there were no schoolhouses in the squadrons . But after a time it was made a condition of having a school at all that the squadron should build a schoolhouse . This tended to fix the limits of the districts . But another step was taken by which the disintegrating process was hastened and confirmed . The moving school was the town school , sent on its travels by a vote of the town , and with the limits of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually the same teacher taught throughout the year ,  --  a veritable " peripatetic philosopher . " But about the middle of the century or a little later some of the towns were divided into districts , and each district was allowed to draw its share of the school money and spend it as it liked . Thus the selection of the teacher , his pay , and the time when the school shall be kept , are taken out of the hands of the selectmen , and the school ceases to be a town school . Not only is the amount of schooling diminishing , but the quality is evidently deteriorating . The moving school does not attract the best men . Special inducements are offered . Professed schoolmasters - notice the word - ar6 by law exempted from militia duty ; next they are exempted from watch , and then from taxes on polls , and sometimes from taxes on estate . On the other hand , fences are found necessary to keep out the unworthy . The grammar master must be approved by the minister of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He must be not only good , but conspicuously good . Here is the first compulsory certification of teachers known in our history . Another section of the same law marks a decided change in the conditions and also declares a principle of the highest importance . The acts declare that keepers of schools must be of sober and good conversation , and must have the allowance and approbation of the selectmen under the penalty of forty shillings . The phrase " keepers of schools " is significant . Before this we have read in the laws only of schoolmasters ; but the tendency to lift the burden of school support from the parents to the public had been working , and early in the eighteenth century we begin to find such entries in the town records as " paid Widow Walker ten shillings for schooling small children " ; " paid for boarding schooldame at three shillings per week " ; " paid for a horse to carry the schooldame up and bring her down again . " That is , the towns had absorbed into their public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not universal . In some of the larger towns no public provision for the youngest children was made for another hundred years . The employment of women was made more general by the scattering of the population . If it was difficult to find men willing to itinerate with the grammar schools , although they might be employed the year through , it was impossible to find men willing to teach the little neighborhood schools for a few weeks or months at a time . For these the schooldames were indispensable . Mendon voted to choose schooldames to teach school in the outskirts of the town . Westford voted to hire a schooldame the following six months to keep the school in six parts of the town . Far out on the frontier , in Northfield , where now those magnificent institutions honor the wisdom and the liberality of Dwight L. Moody , the first teacher was Mrs. Elizabeth Field , the wife of the smith . She had a class of young children twenty-two weeks in the warm season , at fourpence per week . While teaching she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her husband 's brother at a shilling and sixpence per pair , and cared for her four young children . Now that primary education is becoming a public matter , it attracts the attention of the Legislature , and the State recognizes its duty and declares its right . It affirms its purpose to protect the stream at its source . Not only must the masters be approved , but all keepers of schools ,  - -  not only keepers of schools supported by the public money , but keepers of private schools as well . So we find frequent entries in the records that certain women are allowed and approved by the selectmen to keep schools for young children . This early declaration seems to have been strangely overlooked in recent discussions . If , for the protection of the children and the good of the State , the teachers in the public schools must be known to be persons of good moral character and competent to instruct , why not the teachers of the private schools for the same reason ? If public policy requires that the State must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhibit wild animals in a tent , why should it allow anybody to open a school who can entice parents to send their children to it , and make no provision by which the public can even know that such a school exists ? It has been argued that State inspection of private schools would lead to a demand for State support ; but State approbation and oversight of private schools no more implies State support than licensing a circus justifies a claim for a subsidy . All these processes which we have been observing went on with varying steps , under varying conditions , as the towns multiplied : new towns , imitating the old , settled masters in the larger communities , itinerant ones in the more sparsely settled , schooldames , sometimes at public expense , sometimes at private , short schools in the outskirts , longer ones in the village , until the gathering storm of the Revolutionary period absorbed all attention . The public thought was held to political questions until the long struggle was over , independence secured , the province changed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national era begun . In the State Constitution itself the framers recognized the existing system in all its parts , and reannounced the principles declared by the fathers " Wisdom and knowledge as well as virtue diffused generally among the body of the people , being necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties , and as these depend upon spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the various parts of the country , and among the different orders of the people , it shall be the duty of legislatures and magistrates in all future periods of this commonwealth to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences , and all seminaries of them , especially the University of Cambridge , public schools and grammar schools in the towns . " No sooner had the pressure of war been removed , and the agitations of constitution making subsided , than the old subject of popular education came again to the front , and in 1789 a most elaborate school law was framed , crystallizing into statutes all the principles and practices // which had been slowly evolving during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old in graduating its requirements to the population of the towns . Towns having fifty families must furnish each year six months ' schooling by a master ; this might be in one school or many . For the larger towns a longer aggregate time was prescribed . These were English schools . Besides these , towns of two hundred families must support a grammar schoolmaster . The old school law had required instruction only in reading and writing ; the new law prescribed reading , writing , the English language , orthography , arithmetic , and decent behavior . Except by special direction of the selectmen , no youth may be sent to the grammar school unless they have learned elsewhere to read . The masters of all these schools must be graduates of some college or university , or they must produce a certificate of qualification from a learned minister of the town or neighborhood . And besides , they must produce a certificate of moral character from a minister or from a selectman of their own town . The august General Court condescends to consider children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masters or mistresses of schools for this primary education must also be approved as persons of sober life and conversation , and qualified to teach . Towns are authorized to divide their territory , and fix the limits of school districts . For the first time provision is made by law for regular official supervision of the schools , either by the ministers and selectmen , or by committees specially chosen for the purpose . All the schools must be visited as often as once in six months , and the diligence and proficiency of the scholars determined . Neither the teachers nor the pupils could complain of the curious proviso that reasonable notice should be given of the time of the visitation . Comparing the new law with the old , we see that the standard is that of a degenerate age . Whereas in the early colonial days there was a permanent English school in every town of fifty families , now only six months ' schooling is demanded , and this may be subdivided indefinitely . Whereas each town of a hundred families must have supported a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university , now all such towns below two hundred families need keep only the English school , and might fritter away the twelve months in driblets . Had the old law remained in force , every town in Bristol , Dukes , Nantucket , and Suffolk counties , nine of eleven in Barnstable , twenty of twenty-five in Berkshire , twenty of twenty-two in Essex , seventeen of twenty-three in Franklin , thirteen of sixteen in Hampden , eighteen of twenty-one in Hampshire , thirty-five of forty-one in Middlesex , seventeen of nnieteen in Norfolk , sixteen of seventeen in Plymouth , forty-four of forty-nine in Worcester , two hundred and thirty of two hundred and sixty-five in all must have supported the grammar schools . By the change of a single word , one hundred and twenty of these towns were exempted from obligations which some of them had borne for a hundred and fifty years . The free and open path to the university was closed to the boys of a hundred and twenty towns , and for many of them it has only recently been opened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier laws , is that all which seems new is only an embodiment of sentiments and practices which have already become popular . All the principal towns had established schools before the law of 1647 made them compulsory . Towns had been forming districts for fifty or sixty years . They had been employing women to teach for a longer time . They had been providing free primary schools , and they had been choosing committees for school purposes , regularly or periodically , through all their history ; and they had been teaching all the branches now required . The new law only legalized existing practices . The school system had been developed by the people freely , and not under the stress of legal enactments . Here is the essence of government by the people , and no better illustration of it can be found in all our history . // However the dominant Calvinistic theology of Puritan Massachusetts may have theorized concerning " fixed fate and foreknowledge absolute , " practically it recognized in every village community a free moral agent , acting out its own volitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of this grew the individuality so characteristic of Massachusetts towns : some open to new influences , looking always toward the east , ready to welcome the rising sun , generous in sentiment and in provision , always in the van of social progress ; others narrow , petty , parsimonious , burning incense to the past rather than offering sacrifices to the future , not because they reverenced the past so much , but because incense is cheaper than oxen and sheep , or libations of wine and oil . It is in these towns that popular government is not an unmixed blessing . Here public opinion is proved to be not always the best judge of public interest , and public sentiment not always to tend to conserve or promote the public good . Where ignorance and selfishness dominate , institutions suffer , and thousands of children in Massachusetts have been defrauded of the best part of their inheritance from the fathers by the narrow selfishness of the communities into which it was their misfortune to be born . While most of the provisions of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been modified by subsequent legislation , the law contained one section wholly new in its letter , but focusing in itself all the traditions of the Reformation period , and gleaming still out of the dulness of the Public Statutes . " MORAL INSTRUCTION . " SECT. 55 . It shall be the duty of the president , professors , and tutors of the University at Cambridge and of the several colleges , of all preceptors and teachers of academies , and of all other instructors of youth , to exert their best endeavors to impress on the minds of children and youth committed to their care and instruction the principles of piety and justice and a sacred regard to truth ; love of their country , humanity , and universal benevolence ; sobriety , industry , and frugality ; chastity , moderation , and temperance ; and those other virtues which are the ornament of human society and the basis upon which a republican constitution is founded ; and it shall be the duty of such instructors to endeavor to lead their pupils , as their ages and capacities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the above.mentoned virtues to preserve and perfect a republican constitution and secure the blessings of liberty as well as to promote their future happiness , and also to point out to tbem the evil tendency of the opposite vices . " These men who had just fought through to a triumphant issue the ba*ttle for civil liberty and the right of self-government , who had enthroned the people , were not intoxicated by their success . They knew that a corrupt and wicked king might hold his power indefinitely , but not so a corrupt and wicked people . So they would build about their infant Republic bulwarks of personal integrity and virtue , that thus the public weal might be conserved . Entering upon the new era of national and State history , they set as a corner-stone of their educational system the declaration that what men are more than what they know or what they have , determines the perpetuity of nations . Here is the reply to all charges against the public schools , - that their influence does not make for righteousness . There rests upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed by human authority upon any person , to use his opportunity to make virtuous men and women ; whatever else he may do or leave undone , he can not shift or evade this responsibility , in place of the catechisms and creeds of the earlier days , Massachusetts has put the example and precepts of the instructors of her youth as her chosen means of securing the blessings of liberty to succeeding generations .
