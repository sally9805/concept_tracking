Edward Simmons , President of the New York Clearing House Association , was , the guest of honor , and made the address of the evening . Speaking of the need of currency reform , he said : " How urgent currency reform is we business men have felt every day and every hour of the day . The South and West have felt it , and cry for more money and a more elastic currency . New England has felt it , and proclaims that . the Government must go out of the banking business , and , by only coining money and regulating the value thereof , keep itself within the limits prescribed for it by the Federal Constitution . " Mr. in his admirable message , has laid before the country a calm , convincing statement showing that action , and prompt action , by Congress on the currency is demanded . For my Twit , I hail with satisfaction the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greenbacks paid into the United States Treasury shall not be reissued except for gold . If this should be done , the so-called endless chain will be broken , and the Governmental gold reserve will be protected from dangerous encroachment in time of Panic , " Therefore , let the House of Representatives proceed without delay to pass a good currency reform bill . II ' . the Senate reject it , the people will know where to lay the blame , and the people will also know that the Administration and the Republican Party are currency reformers , both before and after the election . " - Such action will strengthen confidence and increase our credit at home and abroad and will indicate to the advocates of financial honesty and prudence  --  to the-gold Demoprate ( of whom 1 am one ) as well as to the sound-money Republicans  --  where the standard bearers are around whom they can mass their forces . "
