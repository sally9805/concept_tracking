txt A Representative in Congress ought to stand up for his State as well as for his country and his party . There is some present need of reminding the New York members of the House of Representatives that this is one of their duties . In every currency debate it is the custom of ignorant demagogues in the House  --  Populists , Bryan Democrats , and some Republicans  --  to make vicious and lying attacks upon this State and this city . Either because they believe it themselves or because they wish to make other persons more ignorant than them-. selves believe it , they continually affirm that New York is the natural foe of the rest of the country ; that it is a vast and insatiable parasite , fastening upon the body of the Nation and greedily sucking its life blood ; that it hungrily seizes upon the gains of trade and the wages of toil , drawing to itself all the money of the country , insomuch that a great money power has been built up in this city , a thing they personify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast , an Erymanthian boar which the 1G-to-1 Hercules is to slay . It is much to be desired that some New York member gifted with a flow of swift words and a capacity for public indignation should speak up for his State whenever its Populist traducers fall upon it with their calumnies . It may be said that New York needs no defense ; that falsehood and abuse can not harm a sovereign State nor diminish the happiness of its people . That is not altogether true , but even if it were true that New Yorkers do not mind being vilely lied about , it is deplorable that the detested spirit of sectional hatred and jealousy should be fostered in that hall Tthere the Repre. sentatives of all the States meet together in perfect equality to legislate for the whole Union . It is not so much that New York needs defense as that her calumniators would profit by correction . An ignorant man is always and everywhere a pitiable object , but when he occupies a seat in the House of Representatives he becomes not only an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief . It is the duty of his fellows to instruct him , gently if his dull ear is open to soft speech ; with reproof and the lash of invective and words that sting and shame if he is one of those defiantly ignorant fellows who , unblushingly hold up the straitened forehead of a fool . It ought not to be difficult to get the idea through even the thickest skull that New York prospers only when the rest of the country is prosperous . Her wealth increases in proportion as the general wealth increases . If times are hard in Alabama or Texas the stagnation is at once reflected in business here . But times would always be hard all over the United States if New York habitually pillaged the people of their humble accumulations . If there were an actual money devil in Wall Street , and he drew into his own maw the cash proceeds of the sweat of the land , New York would be the greatest sufferer , not the chief gainer . New York can not be conceived of as having interests separable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the head can be held to have one , interest and the body another . We are all nourished by a common prosperity and wax rich and powerful through the prevalence of general conditions of good fortune and by mutual helpfulness . The injury of one is the concern of all . Nor is the accumulation of a great store of money in this city a detriment or a danger to the rest of the country . We are aware that the new Socialism holds that wealth is culpable because it promotes business , which is a crime . But it is not with Socialism that we are now dealing . The Populists in Congress , some of them innocently misguided and some of them blatherskites from choice , are not haters of wealth , for they continually complain that they have not enough of it . They should be forced to see and understand that even the little they now possess would not be theirs if the capital accumulated in New York had not been poured out in vast sums to build the railroads and telegraphs and factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil and mines and forests of the country . It is from concentrated capital , not from capital dispersed all over the country , that the money is obtained for great undertakings . No transcontinental railroad would ever have been built if its promoters had been obliged to visit the bankers of every little town and city in search of purchasers for their shares and bonds . The Federal Government could never dispose of its ' bond issues in time of need if ready capital were not always stored up in New York . Witness the complete failure of the attempt to borrow money by a " popular issue " of bonds . If New York capitalists had not subscribed for the bonds only an insignificant amount of money would have gone into the Treasury . The evil things charged against New York are mythical and imaginary . The accusations are mischievous . They react upon those who make them and spread delusions among the people . No man ought to be permitted to get up in the House of Representatives or the Senate and traduce a State without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that State .
