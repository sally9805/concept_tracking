txt While it is true that the relative merits of the two contestants for the America 's Cup were as far from being settled at 5 o'clock Thursday afternoon as they were at 11:25 in the morning , it is none the less true that one serious lesson was taught by the remarkable performance of the Vigilant when the wind changed . That lesson is best and . most briefly expressed by the old adage that too many cooks spoil the broth . The true story of the cup defender 's being brought to a standstill will , in all probability , not be told till the present series of races has passed into history . Just now each person who was a factor in the deed will have a different version of it , and that in itself will help to prove that there were too many factors . It is generally supposed by sailors that head sail is necessary on a sloop going to windward . Yet the Captain of the Vigilant , when he found that the wind was making a shift from dead astern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spinnaker , which would have held the fair wind till the last second , but also the only head sail . If one coolheaded man , undisturbed by a multitude of counsels , had been in command of the Vigilant , such a blunder could hardly have been made . With the wind about to haul ahead , the first thing to do  --  before taking in anything  --  is to run up the jib . The spinnaker and . balloon jib topsail can then be let down the moment t either of them is taken aback by the new wind . The yacht is now under mainsail and jib and her way will not be lost . The mistake on the Vigilant must have been due to a confusion of advice . No blunders in handling were noticeable aboard the Valkyrie except an apparent reluctance to use the balloon jib topsail . It should be remembered , however , that long runs before the wind are quite unfamiliar to English skippers . Their courses are such that the runs rarely exceed five miles , the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble to get up a balloon jib topsail for al run , but use it rather for very broad reaching . The Valkyrie 's spinnaker stretched clear across her deck and was sheeted home at the foot of the lee rigging . We Americans have found by experience that this plan does not work so well as spilling the wind from the leach of a spinnaker into that of a balloon jib topsail . The cleanness and celerity of the work done by the Valkyrie 's crew were doubtless due to the fact that they were under the control of one mind . It is the custom on English racing yachts for the Captain to hold the tiller on a wind and the second mate when running free . The Captain is , of course , always in command . This custom was observed aboard the challenger on Thursday , and the work of the crew was smoothly done . Aboard the Vigilant an amateur  --  one of the highest skill , to be sure-had the wheel , while two Captains and a second amateur assisted him in planning manoeuvres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all might have gone well ; but when a critical moment came it was evident that there were too many brilliant ideas to dwell together in harmony .
