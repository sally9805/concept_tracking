OFF FOR SOUTH AMERICA - A STORM . NVJNCED that , owing both to lack of public and government support , and to the growing carelessness as to details among Italian managers and actors , dramatic art was suffering a partial eclipse in Italy , after a tour in 1869 in Spain and Portugal , which , owing to the very heavy expenses , and to the revolutionary movements in progress , produced but scanty returns , I decided to accept the offer of a respected South-Anierican impresario . I was anxious to test the question whether in the New World work and study could look for an adequate reward ; and I was attracted also by the foreign appreciation of my country through the agency of art . The new company which I formed for the year 1871 was made up in part of artists who were in Florence at the time , and in part of others whom I knew by reputation . Isolina Piamonti , a very clever and sympathetic actress , with a melodious voice and an attractive face ; Signor and Signora Aiudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best younger leading ladies on the stage ; Lorenzo Piccinini , and Domenico Giagnoni , were my chief supporters , and with them I had twenty of lesser rank whom I need not name . This was a company which for South America might be called extremely good ; it *was certainly one of the best that had everplayed in those countries . Before setting out , I gave twelve representations in Bologna , to get the company well organized and working in unison , selecting those plays which I meant to give in America . At the close of the Lenten season , we all went to Genoa , and embarked aboard the steamer Isabella . The cost of the voyage both ways for the entire company was paid by our impresario , Sefior Pestalardo of Buenos Ayres , with which city the South-American experience of our company was to begin . The national festival fell just at the time when we were due at Buenos Ayres , and that of Montevideo was to be celebrated during our stay there . Everything was well planned , organized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail ; the impresario and I counted on sharing a handsome profit , almost a fortune , as a result of the tour . It was my first voyage to America , the first time that I dared the ocean in a nutshell ; and , whatever may be said , this experience must produce a certain impression upon anybody . Hardly had we entered the Gulf of Lyons , which is traditionally unkind to the sailor , when a tempest burst upon us , so furious that we carried away one of our masts , and had our sails torn to ribbons , and suffered some damage about the decks . All the passengers were compelled to keep below to avoid danger from the waves . I begged the captain 's permission to remain awhile on the bridge to admire that imposing spectacle of irritated nature . To tell the truth my desire to admire the fury of Neptune had only a secondary place in my mind . I was terrified at the idea of being drowned like a rat in my state-room berth , and I fostered the vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be able to save myself in the event of shipwreck . So far as I could , in the midst of the violent motion , and my alarm at the danger , I made my observations . What a magnificent spectacle it was ! The sky was veiled with impenetrable clouds ; the sea was a confused mass of black velvet drapery with tufts of white lace , moved and changed in countless ways by the violent gusts , and hurled with a crash against the sides of our ship . The rain beat against my face , and the lamps shot fitful rays over the horrible but majestic scene , while the detonations of thunder , and the vivid gleams of the lightning , recalled to my mind the siege of Rome . At daybreak we found ourselves running in dangerous proximity to the African coast . The ship 's prow was turned toward Gibraltar , and we made that port with difficulty . It required three days to put the vessel in condition to go to sea again . A MODEL FOR OTHELLO . AT Gibraltar I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one very fine figure , majestic in walk , and Roman in face , except for a slight projection of the lower lip . The man 's color was between copper and coffee , not very dark , and he had a slender mustache , and scanty curled hair on his chin . Up to that time I had always made up 0/hello simply with my mustache , but after seeing that superb Moor I added the hair on the chin , and sought to copy his gestures , movements , and carriage . Had I been able I should have imitated his voice also , so closely did that splendid Moor represent to 779 // me the true type of the Shakesperian hero . Othello must have been a son of Mauritania , if we can argue from Zago 's words to Roderz*g'o . " He goes into Mauritania " ; for what else could the author have intended to imply but that the Moor was returning to his native land ? AT MONTEVIDEO . By reason of adverse winds and weather our voyage to Montevideo occupied forty-two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet us , it was with the melancholy announcement that yellow fever had broken out in Buenos Ayres , and that the death-rate was eight hundred a day . This was depressing news , especially to me who had submitted to the discomforts of so long a voyage , and had punctually paid my artists thirty per cent . above their regular salary , and ten francs of extra pay each , during a month and a half of idleness , in the hope of replenishing my greatly diminished exchequer with the fruits of my art . But much more than by my personal hardships , and the expenditure of a considerable sum , I was occupied by my responsibility for the safety of my companions , whom I had involuntarily led into this predicament . My impresario had taken refuge in the country beyond Buenos Ayres , and there was no way of communicating with that city , since the sanitary cordon fenced it in , and the telegraph was in operation only for government service . I did not know a soul in the country , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt bewildered . On landing , I soon found myself with Signor Sivori , awealthy Genoese merchant , who had been commissioned by my impresario to place himself at my disposition and to be my guide and helper . The excellent man asked me whether I was in need of funds , but I answered him that I was in need of nothing but a theater . Sivori told me that that had been provided for as soon as the epidemic had appeared in Buenos Ayres , and that the Solis Theater , the best in Montevideo , was at my disposal . A day later our first announcement was issued ; but I am sure that the natives , when they read my name on the posters , asked themselves whether I was a tenor or a ballet-dancer . I opened with the " Morte Civile , " and the next day there was no further question as to what I was . The newspapers and the Italian residents had made my quality public , and signs of general satisfaction were manifest . After the first night the theater was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give only three representations a week , but I was requested to give four , to content those who wished to see me oftener . The house , at opera-prices , could hold no more than about $3000 ; but for my benefit-night the receipts were $4500 , for everybody wanted boxes and orchestra-chairs , and the best seats were at a premium . I received a great number of presents , and wreaths and bouquets enough to cover the whole stage . In connection with this benefit at Montevideo occurred a rather curious episode . As I have said , King Victor Emmanuel had presented me with a diamond which he had habitually worn . On account of my devotion to the " Re Galantuomo , " I never took this off my finger , except in those cases in which artistic considerations forbade the wearing of it . One night when the " Morte Civile " was played , I had to take the ring off because it would not have been proper to retain it in my character of a convict fleeing from prison , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch and chain at the back of my dressing-table . After the play , a number of people came to my room while I was dressing , to congratulate me , and my servant handed me my watch and chain , but forgot the ring . My attention was distracted by the conversation of so many people , and I did not notice the absence of the ring ; but when I came to go to bed I perceived it , and sent my man to the theater to recover it . The keeper did not live in the building , and all the doors of the theater were closed . The next morning my servant got up very early and hurried to the theater , but the sweepers had already put the actors ' rooms in order , and my ring was no longer to be found . Had I lost my finger I should not have felt more lively regret . I lodged a complaint with the police , and several persons were arrested ; I had notices posted promising a liberal reward ; I had the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent copies to all the jewelers of America and Europe ; but I got no word of it , and never recovered it . All Montevideo talked of this unfortunate accident . On my benefit-night , while I was receiving the ovations of the public , and was almost buried in the flowers that were thrown to me , a beautiful child of five or six years advanced with a silver salver in his hand , and held out to me a small object which was upon it . As I bent down to kiss the little fellow , a quantity of flowers thrown from a box struck the salver , and caused the little packet to fall , and I lost sight of it in the mass of flowers . The curtain fell , and while the audience was demanding me before the curtain a number of people from the wings swarmed around me to find the object which had gone astray ; but I was distrustful on account of my previous loss , and shouted in a loud voice : " Off the stage , all of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be evacuated at once , while the // little child who had brought the gift fled , terrified and weeping . I began a search alone among the flowers , and I soon found the object , which had fallen out of its box . It proved to be a very beautiful brilliant , to which was attached a card with the words : You have lost the ring of a King ; The Republicans of Montevideo restore it to you . The kind thought gave me great pleasure , and the ring was superb ; still it could not replace that which had been stolen . During our stay of two months at Montevideo the epidemic at Buenos Ayres ceased , and communication was reopened . Shortly afterward I announced our last appearance , with " Giosue il Guardacoste " ( " Joshua the Coast-guard " ) . All the arrangements were made with the steamer America to carry the company to Buenos Ayres , whence no sanitary bulletins had been issued for two weeks . So lively was the sympathy felt for me by all classes that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying homage to an artist ; it was an affectionate family which saw with grief the departure of a wellloved member . In the midst of the applause and bravi , I distinguished the cry as if with one voice : " 0/i  --  a vezl 0/i  --  a vez/ " ( " Once more ! Once more ! " ) , with the sense that I should stay one night more to repeat my last play ; and there was no way of stopping this cry until I had expressed my formal consent . I secured a delay of twenty-four hours from the management of the steamship company , so that I should not miss my engagement at Buenos Ayres . On the morning following this final representation , two hours before our sailing-time , as I was preparing my small private baggage , I heard a confused sound in the distance , mingled with martial strains , coming from several directions . As I arranged the objects upon my toilet-table , I said to myself : " It remains to be seen whether there is some commotion which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while two gentlemen presented themselves , one an Italian , the other a native , in dress-coats and white cravats and gloves , and requested the favor of accompanying me on board the America . I accepted with pleasure , but I could not make out the occasion of this request . The Italian then told me : " The citizens of Montevideo with the resident Italian colony , of whom we are the delegates , wish the honor and pleasure of accompanying you to the steamer . " I then first understood that I was the object of a popular demonstration , and I answered the gentlemen that I was at their orders . I left the baggage to my servant , and descended the stairs with the two delegates , one on each side of me . When I reached the street two bands struck up , and a great shout of " Viva Salvini ! " arose from the throats of a crowd numbering thousands . The streets through which I was to pass were strewn with flowers , the windows were hung with draperies , andfilled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the men , they were either in the procession , or standing at the doors of their houses , holding their hats in the air and shouting . Our advance was very slow on account of the immense crowd which packed the streets , and although I was surrounded by an escort of gentlemen who requested the people to make way for me , we were often compelled to stop , our path being wholly blocked . At short intervals a pause was made , while addresses were read to me in Spanish or Italian . When the reading stopped , the cheers would begin again , and in this way we at last reached the mole , upon which had been erected during the night a large arch of greens and flowers , under which I had to pass . But first all the addresses were presented to me engrossed on parchment , and the people wanted to place around my body an enormous wreath tied with the colors of Italy and of Uruguay . It was not possible for me to walk with this rather voluminous decoration on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the wreath in my hands , with the aid of the citizen delegates . Two tugs dressed with flags were waiting to take me out to the America . The bands and many citizens went on board of one , and with the two delegates I embarked on the other . At my side I found old Signor Sivori , with tears in his eyes ! Before proceeding to the America the two tugs steamed around the harbor , passing alongside all the men-of-war of various nations which were stationed at Montevideo . The sailors manned the yards , and the officers were drawn up on the quarter-decks , and all cheered while their flags were dipped in salute . The America sounded her whistle to summon her passengers on board , and then a thunderous shout arose from the mole ; it was the parting greeting of the people of Montevideo . I went aboard the America with my head . whirling from so great a manifestation of esteem , and I found my colleagues so full of excitement and emotion that they embraced and kissed me . BUENOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the populace saddened by the recent epidemic ( which had not left a single family unscathed ) , and in need of distraction and of breathing anatmosphere of less depression , and the Teatro Colon was always filled . Almost all the boxes were closed with gratings , for the families in mourning // did not wish to be deprived of the pleasure of the theater , but did not care to appear openly ; so it seemed as if I were playing in a convent or a harem . I heard people applauding me , but I could not see them . In success and financial returns , Buenos Ayres was not behind Montevideo ; but we lost the national festivals in both cities - occasions which are always highly profitable to a theater . From Buenos Ayres I went to Rio de Janeiro , where I was disappointed in not finding the Emperor Dom Pedro , who was traveling in Europe . Nevertheless the Princess Regent , daughter of the Emperor , did not miss a single night at our theater , and on the evening of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to me a beautiful solitaire , which was handed to me by her consort , the Comte d'Eu . She honored me with an invitation to the imperial palace , and I found her of the most exquisite amiability . I met no actor of distinction in South America . The theaters were all busy with zarzuele , as bouje operas are called in Spanish , and these they gave with much spirit and correctness . The audiences show interest , as do all those of the Latin races , but they are much quieter than in Italy . They rise easily to enthusiasm , and as easily forget their impressions . ERNESTO ROSSI . AFTER the close of my tour in South America , I returned to Italy , having signed an agreement for the carnival-season at the Teatro Valle in Rome . I had some time to spare , so I gave first a few performances at Bologna and at Naples . It was , I believe , at about this time that the proposition was made to me that I should play Pylades , in Alfieri 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been delighted at an opportunity to join forces with artists of real worth , and I accepted the offer with the greatest pleasure , all the more so because the part of Pylades , in my opinion , has the advantage of lending itself to the production of a great effect with comparatively light fatigue . Be very sure of your lines , keep under control any exuberance in your vocal power , mark the positions liberally , accentuate your phrasing in just measure , hold the interest and curiosity of your audience by the play of your expression , be natural and simple while yet maintaining the dignity of the buskin , and the part of Pylades is mastered . I had before this seen Ernesto Rossi in other parts of the highest importance , such as Poolo in " Francesca da Rimini , " Romeo , and Hamlet . There was a time when , in the last of these parts , the Italian public considered him as superior to all others who had essayed it . Whether this judgment was right or wrong , it is indubitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste more perfectly than those of the AngloSaxon . While he was still young , his sympathetic face and his voice were well adapted to Shakspere 's eccentric personage , as , indeed , to all r6les in which the passion of love was dominant . I do not believe there ever was an artist who could pronounce the words , " I love you ! " as Ernesto Rossi said them . The word " love " sounded well on his lips , but that of " rage " seemed astonished to fall from them , and out ofplace . Impassioned characters found in him an innate comprehension , but he could not sink himself sufficiently in such as were virile and imposing ; this was from no defect in his ability , but owing to lack of natural aptitude for such parts . Many of the parts which he played , and which won renown for him , were by his fine and keen intellect , and by his unwearied study , fashioned and polished like a diamond . The cutting of the gem was perfect , its rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could not be maintained that it was of pure water . It had a faint straw tinge , indistinguishable except to experts , but visible to the experienced , to the intelligent , and to careful analysts , and this almost imperceptible tinge was the fact that the art did not sufficiently conceal the man . Very frequently the man himself would be betrayed in a gesture , or an expression , or in the voice . While the audience was impressed by the actor ' s innumerable endowments , and had before its eyes the very personage and passion that he was portraying , of a sudden its illusion would vanish , and it would be reminded of the man who was playing a part , who was studying his inflections , and designing his motions . In Ernesto Rossi this small defect is like a mole on the face of a beautiful woman , which may even be looked upon as a charm . FIRST TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES . AFTER a few months of rest , I resolved to get together a new company , selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repertory . The excellent Isolina Piamonti was my leading lady ; and my brother Alessandro , an experienced , conscientious , and versatile artist , supported me . An Italian theatrical speculator proposed to me a tour in North America , to include the chief cities of the United States , and although I hesitated not a little on account of the ignorance of the Italian language prevailing in that country , I accepted , influenced somewhat by my desire to visit a region which was wholly unknown to me . Previous to crossing the ocean I had several months before me , and these served me to get my company in training . // favorable . Whether it was the benefit of a more vivifying atmosphere , or the comfort of the national life , or whether it was admiration for that busy , industrious , work-loving people , or the thousands of beautiful women whom I saw in the streets , free and proud in carriage , and healthy and lively in aspect , or whether it was the thought that these citizens were the great-grandchildren of those high-souled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the independence of their country , I felt as if I had been born again to a new existence . My lungs swelled more freely as I breathed the air impregnated with so much vigor and movement , and so much liberty , and I could fancy that I had come back to my life of a youth of twenty , and was treading the streets of republican Rome . With a long breath of satisfaction I said to myself : " Ah , here is life ! " Within a few days my energy was redoubled . A lively desire of movement , not a usual thing with me , had taken possession of me in spite of myself . Without asking myself why , I kept going here and there , up and down , to see everything , to gain information ; and when I returned to my rooms in the evening , I could have set out again to walk still more . This taught me why Americans are so unwearied and full of business . Unfortunately I have never mastered English sufficiently to converse in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in North America would not have been so short , and perhaps I might have figured on the English stage . What an enjoyment it would have been to me to play Shakspere in English ! But I have never had the privilege of the gift of tongues , and I had to content myself with my own Italian , which is understood by but few in America . This , however , mattered little ; they understood me all thesame , or , toput it better , they caught by intuition my ideas and my sentiments . My first appearance was in " Othello . " The public received a strong impression , without discussing whether or not the means which I used to cause it were acceptable , and without forming a clear conception of my interpretation of that character , or pronouncing openly upon its form . The same people who had heard it the first night returned on the second , on the third , and even on the fourth , to make up theirminds whether the emotions they experienced resulted from the novelty of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment of Othello 's passions which was transmitted to them-in short , whether it was a mystification or a revelation . By degrees the public became convinced that those excesses of jealousy and fury were appropriate to the son of the desert , and that one of southern blood 783 must be much better qualified to interpret them than a northerner . The judgment was discussed , criticized , disputed ; but in the end the verdict was overwhelmingly in my favor . When the American has once said " Yes , " he never weakens ; he will *ilways preserve for you the same esteem , sympathy , and affection . After New York I traveled through a number of American cities - Philadelphia , Baltimore , Pittsburg , Washington , and Boston , which is rightly styled the Athens of America , for there artistic taste is most refined . In Boston I had the good fortune to become intimately acquainted with the illustrious poet , Longfellow , who talked to me in the pure Tuscan . I saw , too , other smaller cities , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public was confirmed , not only for me , but also for the artists of my company , and especially for Isolina Piamonti , who received no uncertain marks of esteem and consideration . We then proceeded to Albany , Utica , Syracuse , Rochester , Buffalo , Toledo , and that pleasant city , Detroit , continuing to Chicago , and finally to New Orleans . I reached New Orleans at carnival time , and , in a masked procession in which all nations were represented , I was revolted and offended to see Italy figuring as Pope Pius IX . giving his benediction to a band of brigands , who with their daggers in their teeth were kneeling at the Holy Father 's feet . I was so much disgusted by this offensive and repulsive travesty , due to the suggestion of some renegade , as well as by the unpardonable ignorance of the carnival committee , that I could not refrain from publishing a letter of protest , over my signature , in which I said : Italy for true Italians should be represented by Victor Emmanuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Italian must repel , protest against , and despise this insult offered to a nation which , by its antique traditions , and by its recent deeds , deserves the respect and the admiration of the civilized world ; and we are sure of finding an echo of adhesion to this sentiment among the American people , which is accustomed to render homage and justice to all that is noble and generous . Italians congratulated me , the press kept silence , and the people remained indifferent ; and so the matter was forgotten . This was the only disagree able experience of this tour in America . From New Orleans we sailed to Havana , but found in Cuba civil war , and a people that had but small appetite for serious things , and was moreover alarmed by a light outbreak of yellow fever . One of my company was taken down with the disease , but I had the LEA VES FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SAL VINI. // pleasure of seeing him recover . Luckily he had himself treated by Havanese physicians , who are accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps my comrade would have lost his life under the ministrations of an Italian doctor . In the city of sugar and tobacco , too , it was " Othello " which carried off the palm . Those good manufacturers of cigars presented me on my benefit with boxes of their wares , which were made expressly for me , and which I despatched to Italy for the enjoyment of my friends . In spite of the many civilities which were tendered to me , in spite ofconsiderable money profit , and of the ovations of its kind-hearted people , I did not find Cuba to my taste . Sloth and luxury reign there supreme . I returned from Cuba to the United States , and gave five performances in Philadelphia and ten in New York , after which we went to Rio de Janeiro on the steamer Ontario , a voyage of twenty-eight days . We stopped on the way at St. Thomas , and at Para , on the great river Amazon . A short time after our voyage , the Ontario was lost with all her passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the innumerable journeys undertaken during the long period of my travels I have never had to lament an accident . AGAIN IN nRAzIL . THE Dom Pedro Theater of Rio de Janeiro was the first scene of our activity . The favorable season , the freedom from epidemic , and the certain presence of the Emperor Dom Pedro d Alcantara , who had returned from his travels in Europe , were most favorable , both to the brilliancy of our artistic success , and to our financial profit . The Emperor had me often at his palace in the city , and invited me to a lunch at the country palace of Petropolis , where I saw the Empress , to whom I could give no greater pleasure than to talk of her dear Naples . The affability , kindness , and learning of Dom Pedro are well known . He was a perfect polyglot , and conversed with me in unimpeachable Italian ; the Empress still spoke with the Neapolitan accent . I played ten times at the Dom Pedro , and then I changed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I appeared eight times more , with a constantly growing affluence of spectators . On my days off , I enjoyed visiting the enchanting suburbs of the city , and I formed the opinion that the real America is in Brazil . There Nature bestows her gifts with abundance , and all growth is luxuriantly rank . The trees are as high as our campanili , the roses are as large as pineapples , the birds display a thousand hues , the sky is always serene , the men are courteous , the women most amiable , and even the negroes are more docile and civilized than in their native land . The climate , alas ! leaves much to be desired , and if a European is not careful to lead a hygienic and well-regulated life , he runs the iisk of leaving his bones there . I was under contract to go to Chile , but during my stay in Brazil negotiations were concluded arranging for a few appearances on the way at Montevideo , and at Buenos Ayres . I gave twelve nights more in Montevideo at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by storm . For my benefit the boxes and the best places were put up at auction , and nearly twice the proceeds of the regular prices was taken in . The theater-managers each made $2500 for their own account . The people insisted upon my remaining at Montevideo through all the time that I had destined for Buenos Ayres , and I consented the more readily because in the latter city there was some appearance of political disturbance , which soon developed into civil war . The opera , which had suspended at the Solis Theater to make room for me , had to wait , under an indemnity , for two weeks more before opening again . I paid Iiooo sterling to the administration of the English steamers for the voyage and return of my company from Montevideo to Valparaiso , and , traversing the Straits of Magellan , in eleven days we were in Chile . I should not be frank if I said that the Chileans received us with enthusiasm . Both at Valparaiso and at Santiago I had a succ*s d'es/i ; ne , little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large expenses of so costly a journey . The returns , however , did not compensate for the trouble of going there , especially as we were shut out of Peru by one of the numerous revolutions . Upon my return I arranged to give a farewell appearance at Montevideo . On the morning of my arrival fourteen persons lay dead in the Plaza de la Matrice , as an accompaniment to the presidential elections . Our play was given , notwithstanding , and to a splendid house . This ended my engagements with the company , and I pursued the voyage on the same English steamerto Bordeaux , while my companions took the Italian ship . APPEARANCE IN LONDON . IN Paris I found a letter from the impresario Maplesop , who proposed that I should go to London with an Italian company , and play at Drury Lane on the off-nights of the opera . I was in doubt for a considerable time whether to challenge the verdict of the British public ; but in two weeks after reaching Italy , by dint of telegrams I had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented myself with arms and baggage in London , in the spring of 1875 . Hardly had I arrived , when I noticed the posting , on the bill-boards of the city , of the announcement of the seventy-second night of " Hamlet " at the Lyceum Theater , with Henry Irving in the title-r6le . I had contracted with Mapleson to give only three plays in my season , " Othello , " the " Gladiator , " and " Hamlet , " the last having been insisted upon by Mapleson himself , who , as a speculator , well knew that curiosity as to a comparison would draw the public to Drury Lane . IMPRESSIONS OF IRVING 'S " HAMLET . " I WAS very anxious to see the illustrious English artist in that part , and I secured a box and went to the Lyceum . I was recognized by nobody , and remaining as it were concealed in my box , I had a good opportunity to satisfy my curiosity . I arrived at the theater a little too late , so that I missed the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scene which in my judgment contains the clue to that strange character , and from which all the synthetic ideas of Hamlet are developed . I was in time to hear only the last words of the oath of secrecy . I was struck by the perfection of the stage-setting . There was a perfect imitation of the effect of moonlight , which at the proper times flooded the stage with its rays or left it in darkness . Every detail was excellently and exactly reproduced . The scene was shifted , and Hamlet began his allusions , his sallies of sarcasm , his sententious sayings , his points of satire with the courtiers , who sought to study and to penetrate the sentiments of the young prince . In this scene Irving was simply sublime ! 1-us mobile face mirrored his thoughts . The subtle penetration of his phrases , so perfect in shading and incisiveness , showed him to be a master of art . I do not believe there is an actor who can stand beside him in this respect , and I was so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second act I said to myself , " I will not play Hamletl Mapleson can say what he likes , but I will not play it " ; and I said it with the fullest resolution . In the monologue , " To be , or not to be , " Irving was admirable ; in the scene with Op/zelia he was deserving of the highest praise ; in that of the Players he was moving , and in all this part of the play he appeared to my eyes to be the most perfect interpreter of that eccentric character . But further on it was not so , and for the sake of art I regretted it . From the time when the passion assumes a deeper hue , and reasoning moderates impulses which are forcibly curbed , Irving seemed to me to show mannerism , and VOL . XLVI. - 102. to be lacking in power , and strained , and it is not in him alone that I find this fault , but in nearly all foreign actors . There seems to be a limit of passion within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but beyond that limit theybecome transformed , and take on conventionality in their intonations , exaggeration in their gestures , and mannerism in their bearing . I left my box saying to myself : " I too can do Hamlet , and I will try it ! " In some characters Irving is exceptionally fine . I am convinced that it would be difficult to interpret Skylock or Mejizistopheles better than he . He is most skilful in putting his productions on the stage ; and in addition to his intelligence he does not lack the power to communicate his counsels or his teachings . Withal he is an accomplished gentleman in society , and is loved and respected by his fellow-citizens , who justly look upon him as a glory to their country . He should , however , for his own sake , avoid playing such parts as Romeo and Macbeth , which are not adapted to his somewhat scanty physical and vocal power . THE DECLINE OF TRAGEDY . THE traditions of the English drama are imposing and glorious ! Shakspere alone has gained the highest pinnacle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him such great artists as Garrick , Kemble , Kean , Macready , Siddons , andlrving ; and the literary and dramatic critics of the whole world have studied and analyzed both author and actors . At present , however , tragedy is abandoned on almost all the stages of Europe . Actors who devote themselves to tragedy , whether classical , romantic , or historical , no longer exist . Society-comedy has overflowed the stage , and the inundation causes the seed to rot which more conscientious and prudent planters had sown in the fields of art . It is desirable that the feeling and taste for the works of the great dramatists should be revived in Europe , and that England , which is for special reasons , and with justice , proud of enjoying the primacy in dramatic composition , should have also worthy and famous actors . I do not understand why the renown and prestige of the great name of Garrick do not attract modern actors to follow in his footsteps . Do not tell me that the works of Shakspere are out of fashion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always new-so new that not even yet is he understood by everybody , and if , as they say , the public is no longer attracted by his plays , it is because they are superficially presented . To win the approval of the audience , a dazzling and conspicuous mise-en-sc ? ne does not suffice , as some seem to // imagine , to make up deficiency in interpretation ; a more profound study of the characters represented is indispensable . If in art you can join the beautiful and the good , so much the better for you ; but if you give the public the alternative , it will always prefer the good to the beautiful . RECEPTION IN LONDON . Mv season in London was a real event . The London public had very great attractions both at Drury Lane and at Covent Garden . At the former such celebrated artists as Nilsson and Tietjens , with the tenors Campanini and Fancelli , and the basso Nannetti , were singing in " Lohengrin , " " Fidelio , " and " Lucia di Lammermoor " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighting their hearers with " La Traviata , " " Dinorah , " and the " Barbiere di Siviglia . " I was acting at Drury Lane on the three alternate nights when opera was not given . Whether it was the novelty , or that " Othello " had not been played for a long time , or merely one of the anomalies of the public , which , when it has once set its face in any direction , can with difficulty be made to change , Drury Lane was crowded on the nights when I played Othello . The Prince of Wales did me the honor to summon me to his box to assure me of his admiration . The celebrated poet Browning proved his friendship by securing my admission as a guest to the Athenleum Club . The Garrick Club and the Arts Club tendered me a reception , and granted me honorary membership . I went to call upon the diva Patti , who was surrounded by the most select society , on one of her reception-days , and she had the courtesy to make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am a little jealous of you ? " Between April i and July i6 , 1875 , I gave Othello " thirty times1 the " Gladiator " four times , and " Hamlet " on my last ten appearances . The last play gave the final touch to my reputation ; to this a few lines which I had from Robert Browning will testify . After playing Hamlet I expressed to him my regret that I had not been able to attain in that role all that I had aimed at ; and he answered me : Mv DEAR SALvINI : I do not know whether what you say to me is true about the chords of tenderness which you lacked , or which failed to respond to the touch , in your first representation of " Hamlet . " But this I know , that during your play on Friday the entire lyre of tragedy resounded magnificently . Ever yours , ROBERT BROWNING . I left behind in London many genial acquaintances and enduring friendships , besides a sincere affection for a young orphan girl who became my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with much regret , but with the hope of returning to England for the long season of the following year . A TOUR OF GREAT BRITAIN . I RETURNED to Italy well satisfied with my first experience in London , and I arranged with Colonel Mapleson for a tour in England to begin March i , 1876 , to include the chief cities outside of London , and the season in the capital itself . My new wife was unable to accompany me on the journey which had previously been arranged , and she remained in Florence . I visited Newcastle , Manchester , Liverpool , Edinburgh , Glasgow , Dublin , Belfast , and Birmingham , and on May 15 I appeared again in London , at the Queen 's Theater , which has since been pulled down . Mr. Mapleson certainly was not fortunate in his choice of so obscure a theater ; yet our performance of " Othello " drew , even if under difficulties , a public generous of applause . After the seventh fepetition of the Moor of Venice I fell seriously ill , tortured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . For seventeen days I could not close my eyes , and when wearied nature could no longer resist sleep , the lancinating spasms of my torment counterbalanced the refreshment . The Prince of Wales showed me the thoughtful attention of sending me his own physician , who after consultation declared that my days were numbered . Fortunately he was mistaken ; but the gloomy opinion spread , and several newspapers mentioned it . My sole anxiety was the fear that it would reach my wife 's ears , and to prevent her from setting out to join me , and spare her the fatigues of the journey and a great anxiety , which would surely have been injurious to her in her condition , I sent her word that a severe attack of rheumatism in my right shoulder prevented me from writing to her with my own hand . In this state of affairs I saw that even if I were to get well I should be an invalid for several months , and I determined to discharge my company and shoulder the financial loss . Although my doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression betrayed by my dear and good friends who came to see me , I was convinced that all was over with me . Some of them had hardly entered the room and caught sight of me , when they fled without speaking , covering their eyes with their hands , and making other manifestations of grief . Fate willed that my illness should gradually assume a less alarming character ; and after three days , during which I was given up , the doctor declared that the danger was past , but that I should have to undergo , as I had anticipated , // a long convalescence . My appetite returned a little , I was able to keep up my strength with good wine , and soon I was assured that I should live to see again my family and my native land . As soon as I could stand on my feet I arranged everything for my departure . I stopped for two days in Paris to rest . Ristori , who was staying in that capital with her family , had previously invited me to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my emaciation and at the alteration in my features . When at last I reached Florence , I had to explain everything to my wife , who gave herself up to a torrent of tears at the thought of my danger , and of how she had been cut off from succoring me in this painful experience . VIENNA . AFTER a period of rest with my family at San Marcello and Antiguano , I returned to Florence with my health perfectly regained , and with all my former energy , and formed a new company with the purpose of going to Austria and Germany . To secure the applause of a public accustomed to weigh in the balance artists as conscientious , as thoughtful , and as philosophic as the Germans was a prize not to be despised , and I desired to win it . On February 22 , 1877 , I opened at the Ring Theater in Vienna , with the indispensable " Othello , " and although the audience , with a few exceptions , did not understand a word I uttered , I flattered myself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , as we are taught , God brought about as a punishment upon the builders of the Tower of Babel , might , one would think , be revoked after so many years , so that all might use one language . But this is not to be ! To-day every ignorant person speaks one language ; one who respects himself must be master of two ; an educated man must know three or four ; and a learned man is necessarily a polyglot . Yet it seems to me that all the time that must be spent in the study of language is wasted , and that it could be given much more fruitfully to the acquisition of the sciences . I envy those who can learn many tongues with ease , for this gift has never developed in me ; and in Vienna , particularly , because of this , I suffered some embarrassment . We Italians have , however , a facility in making ourselves understood without speaking , supplying the lack of words by gestures , and by the mobility of our expression , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most lively interest in my playing was shown by the artists of the Burg Theater , some of whom I had the pleasure of knowing intimately ; and I shall always cherish the recollection of the courtesies which I received from Sonnenthal , Lewinsky , Mitter wusser , and the clever and amiable wife of the last . The Viennese are full of enthusiasm for the arts ; they honor and appreciate highly any one who rises above mediocrity , and give expression to their sentiments by the nightly homage to their favorite artists of a profusion of flowers and wreaths . I made such a collection of souvenirs that my lodgings were hardly large enough to hold them all . The press was unusually favorable to me , and from the translations which I procured of the articles concerning me I found that little or nothing had escaped appreciation of all that I had expected would be lost on account of my foreign idiom . I do not refer to the praises which were addressed to me , but to the detailed studies of my conceptions . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified criticisms , and praise unmarred by exaggeration : nothing could be more correct , more wise , more conscientious . The German actors have one most valuable quality - that of studying much , a feature which in general is wanting in us Italians , for we are wont to fancy that we have done much study when in fact our preparation is still insufficient . The Germans are more patient in application ; they investigate with accuracy the personage whom they are to play , and they lead all the actors of the world in their talent for merging their own personality in that of their role . It may be that they are somewhat lacking in life , that they do not rise to the feverish heights of passion , but always remain calm and collected ; but what harmony and precision in the whole ! One might imagine that they were guided by a mathematical study , as it were , of their art , and that they had undertaken to put it into methodical practice . From this come that unison , that evenness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meininger Company . The great actress Wolter , the Ristori of the North , by her intellectual qualities stands in the first rank among the actresses of the century . In talent and penetration , and in identification of herself with her r6les , she is second to none , and she is not wanting in a spark of genius to illuminate her carefully elaborated interpretations . I remained at Vienna from February 22 to April 8 , and played twenty-five times , in " Othello , " " Hamlet , " " Macbeth , " the " Gladiator , " the " Morte Civile , " " David Garrick , " and " Ingomar . " I made the acquaintance of the author of the last very beautiful and interesting composition , Baron von Bellinhausen , who wrote under the pseudonym of F. Halm , and he was kind enough to declare me his most successful interpreter . If you can only succeed in an enterprise , your temerity in haying // attempted it will always be condoned ; and it was in truth a temerity on my part to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirably presented by celebrated actors . But " fortune favors the brave ! " A RECITATION AT DOM PEDRO 'S . DURING my season in Vienna , Dom Pedro d ' Alcantara , Emperor of Brazil , and the most erudite crowned head of the century , was expected in that city . One morning at eight o'clock the secretary of the Brazilian legation came to my hotel to announce to me that the Emperor Dom Pedro desired to see me as soon as possible . I dressed at once , and at nine I was in the presence of his majesty . As soon as he saw me he said to me in pure Italian , and with as much eagerness as if he were asking me to save his throne : " Salvini , you must do me a service ! " I was somewhat taken aback , for I did not see how I could be in a position to do service to an emperor . " Your Majesty , " I said , " in what can I be so happy as to serve you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' I was reassured and breathed freely , and answered : " It will give me much pleasure , your Majesty ; but I have alreadygiven the Morte Civile ' five times , and I fear that the public may have had enough of it . " " Do it the sixth time for me , " said the Emperor , " and never mind the public . " I said : " Your Majesty 's judgment outbalances that of an entire public , and your desire shall be satisfied as an honor to myself . " On that evening all aristocratic Austria crowded the Ring Theater . During Dom Pedro 's sojourn in Vienna , I was invited to recite Prati 's poem " La Cena d ' Albomo , " in a large concert-hall , for the benefit of the Viennese students . In addition the entertainment consisted of vocal and instrumental music . Dom Pedro was among the first of the audience to arrive . While I was waiting my turn , an aide-de-camp of the Emperor Francis Joseph invited Dom Pedro to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibly annoyed , but he arose and left the hall , sol had to make my recitation without him as an auditor . Before he left Vienna , being unable to return all the innumerable attentions paid to him , he directed his minister to give a grand entertainment , and I was not forgotten . Unfortunately I bad to play 0/hello on the night in question . Greatly fatigued as I always was by that play , wben it was done I dressed , and went to the Brazilian minister 's residence . The crowd of nobles and dignitaries , with all the feminine aristocracy of Vienna , was so dense as to make it almost impossible to pass from one room to another . I placed myself in a door-way , and perceived Dom Pe dro before me , who , while talking with the Princess Metternich , kept turning his glance in my direction . Of a sudden he rose , and , coming straight up to me , he requested me to repeat the poem of Prati 's of which he was so fond , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw that I was lost . " Your Majesty , " said I , " I come from playing 0/hello , and my voice is rough from it ; moreover I do not know whether it will be opportune for me to recite in Italian before these ladies and gentlemen who are not acquainted with the language. ** " Never mind ! Never mind ! " he replied . " If these gentlemen do not understand , so much the worse for them ; but you will do me a very great pleasure , for I am very fond of those verses of Prati 's , whom I know personally . " How could I refuse ? Soon the orchestra , which bad been playing on a raised dais , passed into another room , and the dais was left free for my stage . Dom Pedro himself directed the placing of chairs in rows like those of a theater , and when all was ready , and the company had been informed of what I was to recite , the Emperor invited me to begin . I found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time there were spontaneous cries of Bravo ! and Bend Some understood , some pretended to understand , and most understood not a word . My recitation was nevertheless effective , and when it was done I was surrounded by many beautiful ladies and by many gentlemen , who offered me abundant congratulations - perhaps to pay their court to the Emperor . Dom Pedro waited until the crowd had finished its phrases of admiration , and then approached me , much moved , and spoke in my ear only the words : " Sublime ! Thank you . " This was at about two o'clock , and I drove back to my lodgings so wearied and worn out that I could not sleep , by reason of my overwrought nerves . The next day I concluded that it was at no little sacrifice that one could win the admiration of an emperor . I ought , however , to be grateful to bim , for after such an advertisement the Ring Theater was patronized by the best society during the remaining nights of my season . PLAYING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence to Prague , and then to Berlin . In the capital of Germany I met with a flattering greeting . I had the opportunity to know the most distinguished men in literature and in art . The court displayed much interest in my acting , and the old Emperor William particularly , as I judged , must have felt much sympathy for me , // for he would rise from his chair and go to the back of his box to applaud without being seen . It appears that etiquette imposed upon him reserve in open manifestation of approval . The Crown-princess Victoria , now the widow of the Emperor Frederick , honored me with undisguised marks of her approval , and did not lose a single one of my performances . People wanted me to petition for presentation at court , but I declined , for the reason that I did not care to expose myself to the humiliation of a refusal , and that if any of the august personages desired to know me personally , they had only to command my presence before them . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of delicacy kept me fixed in my resolution . At last I received a summons to present myself at court . I was received by the Crown-prince Frederick William and the Crown-princess Victoria , with all their children , then very small , and was treated with the greatest affability and courtesy . Among many questions which they put to me , they asked me whether I should have any objection to give a play with my company in the theater at Potsdam . I could not refuse so kindly an invitation . The evening and the play were decided upon . The next day a chamberlain came to ask me diplomatically what compensation I wished for giving this play at the private court theater . I answered that when I gave my cooperation for an entertainment outside of a public theater it was not my custom to fix a price , and that I would not do it . The chamberlain , however , insisted , saying that it was not proper that the court should accept a gift ; to which I replied that it was not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask as my compensation the gloves which the Crown-princess would have worn when applauding me . I had great trouble to persuade the diplomatic messenger to take back my answer , but he had to content himself with it . On the appointed day I took my company to Potsdam to play " Sullivan , " a comedy for which only the dress of to-day is requisite . All my actors were lodged in a wing of the palace , where refreshments were provided , and I was invited to take my place in a carriage in which were the Crown-princess Victoria and her sons , and we drove to Sans Souci to visit the memorials to Frederick the Great and to Voltaire . The princess described every object and locality to me in detail , with the greatest interest and affability , together with all the memories attached to scenes so full ofassociations . Upon our return to the palace , I made ready to give my play . A sudden indisposition kept the old Emperor from being present . The small but graceful theater was literally packed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nobility , the diplomatic corps , the magistracy , and the military . The performance was of glacial frigidity , for at court all applause is absolutely prohibited . After the play I was invited to take tea with the Crown-prince and Crown-princess , and I found myself in the midst of all these beautiful and elegant ladies and distinguished gentlemen , who plied me with questions , congratulations , and compliments . Of these one , which surpassed all the others both in its form and in its exquisite idea , was addressed to me by the Crown-princess , who said to me : " Since Rachel , you are the first , Salvini , to tread the stage at Potsdam ; I think that its doors must be closed after so great an event ! " And in fact the doors of the theater in Potsdam have not been reopened since my appearance there . I went away from Berlin delighted with the kindness and courtesy of the German court , and with a public of such intelligence ; and upon my arrival at Trieste , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German consul that there was an object addressed to me at the custom-house . I went there , and found a ring with a solitaire diamond , which had been sent to me by the Emperor William and the Crown-prince and Crown-princess , as a souvenir of my appearance at Potsdam .
