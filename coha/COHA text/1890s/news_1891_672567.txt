txt The Harvard Athletic Committee last evening rejected , by a vote of 5 to 4 , the graduate proposition to appoint CoL W. A. Bancroft as coach to the Freshman and ' Varsity crews . Graduates desire to secure the services of a competent coach like Banoroft , who was stroke on the crews of 1877 , 1878 , and 1879 , each of which beat Yale . In 1880 Bancroft coached the team , and it lost , bat in 1882 and 1883 , with his coaching , they won easily . The boat club had asked that Bancroft be engaged as coach for three years . The Harvard Daily Orimson says to-day editorially : " We consider this to be a great blow to the boating interests of Harvard , and particularly unfortunate just now , when we seem to be almost at our wits ' end . " The Harvard authorities have prepared the best possible substitute for the coach of the crew in the shape of a trainer in rowing . By vote of the corporation a new position , with a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Mr. Lathrop , the trainer in track athletics . The new officer will be trainer in rowing , and will give his whole time to the work , coaching not only the University and Freshman crews , but other oarsmen as welL The incumbent has not yet been selected . The choice lies with the Executive Committee of the boat club , subject to the approval of the Athletic Committee . No oarsman has as yet even been suggested for the position . The great difficulty with this plausible scheme is that no graduate would be willing to take up the profession of permanent trainer and the only men usually mentioned as competent to coach are a few of the boating graduates . There has been a great objection to the employment of professional soullers , as they are thought to teach a stroke disastrous VI eight-oar rowing . The new institution there . fore does not promise much immediate relief tt a crew deprived of the services of Bancroft.                    @
