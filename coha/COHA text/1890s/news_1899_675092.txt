txt Chairman . Cannon of the Appropriations Committee of the House , in the course of the general debate on the Sundry Civil bill to-day , sounded a note of warning against extravagant appropriations and practically served notice that neither the Ship Subsidy bill nor the Nicaragua Canal bill could be passed at this session . Although he specifically disclaimed speaking for any one but himself , the statements he made coming from the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee caused great interest . Mr. Cannon 's speech was made immediately after the introduction of the Sundry Civil bill . Being in charge of the measure , Mr. Cannon made a general analysis of what it contained . It carried , he said , $62,928,101 , but $20,000,000 was for payment to Spain to carry out the provisions of the Paris treaty . Exclusive of that , the bill carried $8,095,708 less than the estimates and *5,929,311 less than the current law . Having set forth the provisions of the bill , Mr. Cannon made a general statement as to the condition of the revenues . The Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had estimated the deficiency of the revenues for the fiscal year ending July 1 , 1899 , to be $112,000,000 , or a monthly average of $9,333,000 . In his judgment , In the light of the receipts and expenditures for ' the first seven months thus estimated , the deficiency was much too low . The actual deficiency up to Feb. 1 , 1899 , was $93,151,000 , an average of $13 , - 307,000 per month . At this rate the deficiency for the fiscal year would be $159,000,000. 33u .. this would not include the $20,000,000 provided by the bill to carry out the provisions of the Parie treaty . The cash balance in the Treasury Feb. 1 , including the ' **25;90;TOOLONG gold reserve , was $274,000,000 . Two hundred million of that had been put into the revenues by the war loan . Deducting the monthly estimated deficiency for the next five months there would , he said , be in the Treasury July 1 $208,000,000 . This was a conservative estimate . There would ae , therefore , $108,000,000 to meet the ordinary expenses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , took . no account of the Linking fund . To care for it would require $53,000,000 additional . The Secretary of the Treasury estimated the expenditures for the next fiscal year , exclusive of the sinking fund , at $641,000. - 000 and the revenues $610,000,000 , or a deficiency of $31,000,000 . Yet Secretary Gage could not possibly have foreseen in his estimates for 1900 the changed conditions which followed , the negotiation of the peace treaty , the expenditures which necessarily follow our occupation of the Philippines . and the obligations which we assumed in the peace treaty to discharge the claims against Spain , which claims , he understood , already reached $25,000,000 . ARMY AND NAVY NECESSITIES . Neither did , the Secretary 's estimate take into consideration the increase of the navy . It estimated only for the ordinary mainte nance of the navy . But the Naval Committee would report in its bill provision for from twelve to fifteen new battleships and cruisers . He did not complain . It was a logical sequence . The army must also be increased . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully realize the Condition which confronted us . With , these enormous expenditures upon us , said Mr. Cannon , we must plant our footsteps with care , to see that no dollar goes out of the Treasury except for an efficient public service . " Do you take into account in your estimate , " interrupted Mr. Dockery , ( Dem. , Mo. , ) " the Hanna-Payne subsidy bill ? " Mr. Cannon replied that he did not include ' in his calculation of a deficiency of $159 , - 000,000 either the legislation for an efficient merchant marine or the construction of the Nicaragua ' Canal . He favored the regeneration of , the merchant marine Republican applause ) and the construction of the Nicaragua Canal . Republican applause . " But , " he added with great emphasis , " ' I am not ' willing , to enter upon either of these vast enterprises until we have given them full and proper consideration , and until we have provided the revenue to meet these expenditures . I insist that there shall go hand in hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues to meet their cost . " " Does the gentleman mean , " interposed Mr. Carmack , ( Dem. , Tenn. , ) " that , owing to the responsibilities we have assumed abroad , we must , spend less money at home ? " Mr , Cannon replied that nothing he had said could be distorted into such a statement . But he gave it as his opinion that the United States would never again spend less than was spent in the year prior to the war with Spain . He did not stand in his place seeking to cripple an efficient public service for a great and growing population , but he Was opposed to entering upon new lines a expenditure until " there had been full consideration and real debate , and not then unless there was already on the statute books revenue legislation to meet the expenditures . " Mr. Cannon proceeded to point Out that all the time for the remaining three weeks of the session would be occupied , and that there would be no time to give these measures the intelligent and proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused by the statement . Mr. Grosvenor ( Rep. , Ohio. ) wanted to know whether Mr. Cannon ' assumed that one of the great committees of the House ( the InterState and Foreign Commerce Committee ) had been idle or derelict in its duty . It was prepared to enlighten the House on the subject of the canal . Mr. Cannon insisted that nothing he had said reflected upon the committee . But it was simply an organ of the House . He was not charging it with dereliction , but if it could multiply itself tenfold in strength and wisdom there was no time in the next three weeks for it to place itself in touch with the members so that the House could intelligently determine the- legislation necessary for the inauguration of that great work . AN EXPLANATION WANTED . Mr. Hepburn , Chairman of the Committee on Inter-State and Foreign Commerce , asked Mr. Cannon to be more explicit . Coming from him a statement meant a great deal . He demanded to know whether Mr. Cannon was to be understood as saying that no opportunity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . Mr. Cannon disclaimed any purpose of speaking for any one but himself . I am but one member , " said he . " I speak only of myself . I voice only my own . opinion . I do not reflect the sentiment of others , but I do say candidly upon by own responsibility that it is ' absolutely impossible in the time remaining for us to intelligently consider either of these bills . " At the same time Mr. Cannon professed his friendship for the canal project , and arouse , enthusiasm as he spoke of the future time when the United States would construct the canal upon a zone of territory owned by the United States from the centre of the earth to the sky above . Mr. William Alden Smith , ( Rep. , Mich. , ) with some display of heat , insisted that the canal should be constructed even if posterity had to be mortgaged to do so . But Mr. Cannon replied that he could not be swept off his feet . Immature , ill-considered legislation now . he declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance it . Mr. Smith protested against foreclosure of opportunity to act upon the bill , but Mr. Cannon reiterated his statement as to the impossibility of doing it justice in the time remaining . A HINT ABOUT BONDS . " I favor the construction of the canal , " said Mr. Smith , " even if we have to issue bonds and mortgage the future . " " It is well enough to talk glittering generalities in an after-dinner speech , " retorted Mr. Cannon . " But when we enter upon practical legislation we must dot our ' i 's ' and cross our t'sa " The canal bill can not properly be considered during the next three weeks . When you or anybody else can tell me what the cost of this enterprise will be , " said he , turning angrily upon Mr. Smith , " and tell me when we can get title to the territory and arrange the means to pay for the canal , I 'll join hands with you . " " In view of the deficiencies in the revenues which the gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dem. , Washington. ) " does he anticipate an early issue of bonds ? " " We can support the navy , army , and perform our duties here and in our outlying possessions out of the present revenues this year and next , " replied Mr. Cannon , frankly , " but if we are to accomplish that , we must see to it that no great appropriations go through in the immediate future . If you take on great blocks of expenditures , you must issue bonds . " " Can there be a reduction in the war taxes ? " asked Mr. Sims , ( Dem. , Tenn . ) " Not during the next two years . ' " In your estimates have you included any revenue from Puerto Rico or the Philippines ? " asked Mr. Dockery . ' I have not . " " You insist only that there shall be full and complete consideration before there shall be legislation on either the canal project or the merchant marine ? " " Precisely . " At the conclusion of Mr. Cannon 's remarks , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Dem. , Ind. , ) spoke earnestly in favor of the immediate necessity for a etrenchment , and Mr. Taibot ( Dem .. S. C. , ) in opposition to the Ship Subsidy bill . NEW JERSEY CORPORATIONS National .
