Rothkopf , a Broadway dealer in millinery trimmings , while the latter was riding to his place of business on a Grand Street car . The scarfpin was valueld at $50 , and when Assistant District Attorney Unger asked that Murray 's bail be fixed at $10,000 Justice Fitzgerald looked up in surprise . Mr. Unger explained , that Murray was one of the most slippery customers that the District Attorney 's office had had to deal with in a- long time .
