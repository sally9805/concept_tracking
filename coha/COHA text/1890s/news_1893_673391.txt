txt Minister Thurston. representing the provisional Government of Hawaii . organized to remain until the treaty of annexation should be acted Upon , evidently desires to become a " martyr . " Assuming that the American people are committed to the determination of the last Administration to gobble the Hawaiian Islands , and that it is safe to ignore all precedent and law governing the conduct of diplomatic representatives , he has employed the press to retort to the statements of Minister Blount to the Secretary of State . who is only the representative of the President in the State Department . Mr. Thurston has not seen diplomatic service long enough , perhaps , to know that he has committed an offense against international law , but it may be possible that he knew well enough that he should not take to the public prints if he desired to remonstrate . He must have had a doubt of the propriety of a public address on a matter under consideration , unless he chose to disregard custom in order to provoke harsh treatment of himself . It would used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of remonstrance against any policy of the United States should be made through the Secretary of State , and be regarded as confidential . If Mr. Thurston had read any international law at all , he would have known that corm repundence by a Foreign Minister with the press in this country , on subjects connected with his mission , such correspondence involving an appeal to the public on diplomatic issues , is ground for his dismissal . But Minister Thurston does not appear to Consider his chances of continued relations with the State Department to be secure , or he would have remembered that a foreign Minister is to correspond with the Secretary of State on matters which interest his nation , and is not to be permitted to resort to the press . It would be to accuse him of ignorance of the plain injunctions of international law to doubt that he knew that he had no authority to communicate his sentiments to the people by publications , either in manuscript or in print , and that any attempt to do so is contempt of this Government . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with the the United States only upon concern his mission or trust . The Minister of the provise-mal Government offers nothing new in his redly to the published reports of Mr. Blount . The zealous reports of ex-alinister Stevens about the " unlooked-for " and " abrupt " revolution were mete up of about the same assertions . His disregard of custom and international law may he joined with en impression that he may prove to be a revolutionist in the United States , and that his defiance of custom may help him to develop a revolution here against the State Department that refuses to sustain the schemes of the Hawaiian revolutionary leaders . It is presumable that Minister Thurston has counted upon general repudiation of Mr. Biount 's report and acceptation of his undiplomatic answer to it . He keeps up the story told so vigorously by Secretary Poster on Feb. 15 , OM . in his report to President Harrison . approved the same day . submitting the treaty of annexation . Mr. Foster treated the revolution as a thing that had sprung up over night , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ahead , even to the programme of proceedings . And Mr. Thurston attempts to support Poster 's story , which stated that the Queen had an extra force of 500 armed men at her disposal , and that there was every indication of an armed conflict at any moment . " There is sufficient difference between the stories of Blount and Thurston to raise the question of veracity . While it may be hoped that Thurston would not willfully lie , Mr. Blount has been known here so long , and so publicly , that his word would be better than Mr. Thurston 's bond . He found that on the day when Foster asserts that there was ? ? every indication of an armed conflict at any moment , " business was not interrupted , no one was excited , and a band concert given In the plaza was attended by the usual peaceful crowd . Mr. Foster was evidently greatly misled as to the posting of the force from the Boston , for , instead of being " isolated and inconspicuous , " they occupied a commanding position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more impressive upon the people than the 500 extra troops of the Queen , of whom Mr. Foster wrote . But even Mr. Foster did not go so far as to justify all that Minister Stevens did The Minister had asserted a protectorate over Hawaiian affairs pending annexation . Mr. Foster appears to have approved all that Mr. Stevens did to help overthrow the Government . but he disavowed the assertion of the power of the United States to impair the independent sovereignty of the Hawaiian Government by a formal protectorate . His recommendation that the United States continue the de facto Government pending acceptance of the treaty of annexation may have looked like an inconsistent suggestion , a menace of power that was disavowed , as it certainly was not precisely a support of independent sovereignty . There was no message from the State Department to Minister Thurston to convey to him his passports . If one may judge of common report , expressively the sentiments of the annex.a.tIonist-s at the capital , Mr. Thurston courted dismissal . not alone because dismissal would make him a hero with the revolutionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain for him greater popularity In the United States . Should the provisional Government be maintained he could scarcely hope to remain acceptable here . If it should fail , he would have to be content to be a hero who won his glory in a fight against international law and the diplomatic customs that are the outgrowth of centuries of experience . Secretary Gresham now waits patiently for news from Honolulu . He does not expect to hear of bloodshed . nor of any extraordinary excitement . He does not endeavor to account for the surmises published as to what were the instructions of Minister Willis . nor does he affirm or deny the reports that encourage the expectation that there is to be a forcible restoration of the Queen 's authority . It would be a great disappointment to the critics of the Administration if the restoration of the " legitimate Government " should be accomplished by consent of the recent annexationists , and the Hawaiians induced to work out their own problems of government in their own way .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
