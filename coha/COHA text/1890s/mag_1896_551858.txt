EDITOR 'S TABLE . No one who was present at Plymouth on Forefathers ' Day , at the celebration of the 275th anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims , will ever forget the culminating moment in Senator Hoar 's great oration . It was in the very week that the country had been shocked by the threatening words toward England in President Cleveland 's message on the Venezuela question , the hasty action of Congress , and the reckless words , more culpable than either , of portions of our press and people , showing a degree of the spirit of war and of the old , unthinking prejudice against England , which it was hoped had forever passed away in America . There was no heart in that vast assembly which was not heavy with the burden of responsibility so suddenly laid upon the nation , and no Qne who did not feel that the great senator , knowing history and its deep lessons as no other now in the na tional councils knows them , could not let that memorable occasion pass without some clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people waited for that word ; and every ear was alert and every face showed a new eagerness when , as he neared the close of his oration , in his magnificent characterization of the Pilgrim qualities , he said with peculiar and solemn emphasis " The Pilgrims were Englishmen . Their children are , in the essentials of national character , Englishmen still . We have a great admixture of other races . But it is an admixture chiefly from those northern races of which England herself was composed . In spite of past conflicts and present rivalry England is the nation closest to us in affection and sympathy . The English language is ours . English literature is , perhaps , more familiar to the bulk of our people than to Englishmen // themselves . The English Bible is still our standard of speech , our inspiration , our rule of faith and practice . We look to English authority in the administration of our system of law and equity . English aptness for command , habit of success ; indomitable courage , unconquerable perseverance , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men of other blood who come here acquire and are penetrated with the English , or perhaps without boasting or vanity we may say , the American spirit . The great bulk of our people are of English blood . But by the spirit , which has its own pedigree , its own ancestry , its own law of descent and of inheritance , we are English even more than by any tie of physical kinship . It is of this pedigree of the spirit , governed by forces of which science has as yet given us rio account , that we are taking account to-day . It is by virtue of its laws that John Winthrop counts George Washington among his posterity , James Otis transmits his quality to Charles Sumrier . Emerson may well be reckoned the spiritual child of Bradford ; Chanrung the spiritual child of John Robinson ; and Miles Standish the progenitor of Grant . . . . When the boys who went out from a New England dwelling to meet death at Gettysburg or Antietam with no motive but the love of country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are gone , the men who fought the livelong day with Wellington or obeyed Nelson 's immortal signal , they shall Claim kindred there and have the claim allowed . ' " The orator paused  --  and a hush fell upon the multitude . " What I said just now , " he continued with deliberation , breaking the silence , " was written more than ten days ago . Let it stand ! " It was an electric word ; and quick as the thunder follows lightning came the great tempest of applause and gratitude from the hands of every man and woman of the thousands gathered there . Never before , it seemed , had approbation been so eager , so solemn , or so eloquent . " Let it stand ! It is well that these two great nations should know something of each other that they do n't get from their metropolitan press , whether in London or in New York . Each of them should know that , if it enter into a quarrel with the other , it is to be a contest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most like to itself . The quarrel will be maintained on both sides until Anglo-Saxon , until English , until American , endurance , is exhausted . For that reason , if for no other , such a conflict should never begin . This whole thing is very simple . We can not permit any weak power on this continent to be despoiled of its territory , or to be crowded out of its rights , by any strong power anywhere . England would not permit us to do that to Belgium or to Denmark . On the other hand , we have no title to interfere with the established boundaries of English territory , whether we like them or do not like them . All between these two limits is subject for discussion and for arbitration ; subject for that international arbitration which a delegation of English members of Parliament came to Boston a few years ago to impress upon us , saying that , in their desire for its establishment , they represented the opinions of a large majority of the English House of Commons . The settlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business men and the religious sentiment of these two nations , influences always irresistible when they are united , and when they are brought to bear upon large matters of national and international import . " And once again came the great thunder of applause . New England , gathered by Plymouth Rock , had found her voice . One of her senators , in that jaunty , insane hour at Washington following the reading of the message , the remembrance of which hour still brings the blush to every patriot , had rubbed his hands and // cried that he was " bubbling over with delight . " Another had made haste to move the appropriation of a hundred millions to put the country in readiness for war . But here , by the mouth of her greatest man in the national councils , the deep , true feeling of New England had found expression ; and the reception of the word was as eloquent and memorable as its utterance . Political adventurers might play with the awful issues of war ; but men who pilgrimage to Plymouth Rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do not play , and their voice is not uncertain . * * * The business men and the religious sentiment of the country , said Senator Hoar , would unite to compel the settlement of these unhappy differences upon righteous principles . The reckless politician might bluster for a day , and the irresponsible man about town indulge his folly ; and so they did . The Washington correspondent of our leading Boston newspaper telegraphed on the morning after the message , along with the interviews with scores of congressmen : " The popularity of the message in the country generally was the first thing that most senators and representatives spoke of , and there was no contrary opinion on this point . The war spirit , as a result of thirty years of peace , is supposed to be rising in the country , and the hereditary hatred of Great Britain , the desire of the South to march to battle once more under the American flag , and the impatience of the young men of the country with the slow processes of reward in peaceful pursuits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible war would be popular . " " We ought to show the British our teeth , " was the word , quoted from somebody at one of the great hotels , which , we were told in the local columns of the same issue , crowded with similar insanity , " admirably expressed the views and beliefs of nine-tenths of the representatives of manufacturing houses found at the hotels last night . " But all this was hushed when the real masters of business found their voice , recovering from the confusion into which the country had been so suddenly and wickedly precipitated under circumstances which compelled it to show its superficial side and do itself injustice . The true business men of the country found their voice in the noble address of the New York Chamber of Commerce . They found it in the letter of Charles Francis Adams . They found it earlier still in the speech of Nathan iVIatthews , the late mayor of Boston , at the diii ner of the alumni of the lVassacliusetts Institute of Technology . While hundreds were yet talking of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year 's dances , this sagacious business man reminded Boston and the country what war would really mean to us , and especially what war with England would mean to the interests of civilization with which we are so sacredly entrusted . " If a war should break out between this country and Great Britain , it would be carried on , not by land , but on the sea ; and with the inadequate navy which we now possess there can be no doubt that the principal seat of war would be the cities along our seacoast . These cities are practically defenceless against the attack of a strong naval force . Such a war might and probably would result in the annexation of Canada , and in the paralysis or destruction of British commerce ; but , on the other hand , itwould involve an enormous destruction of property along the sea-coast and perhaps in the destruction of New York , Boston , Baltimore and Philadelphia , in the loss of our foreign markets and an incalculable injury to every branch of industry and commerce . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war on the future of the civilized world . This country would have nothing to gain from it ; but Great Britain would , beside injury to her commerce , suffer perhaps the loss of her colonial empires // in the different sections of the globe . England 's difficulty would be Russia 's opportunity , and we might confidently expect a war between this country and Great Britain to be the signal for the outbreak of that general European conflict which has been pending for a generation . With her naval forces divided , the final outcome , it seems to me , could not be doubtful ; the British empire would be destroyed ; and the ascendancy of the English-speaking races would be forever ended . The final result would be the end of English civilization as the controlling factor in the progress of the world . That such a war with all its consequences should be precipitated by the United States of America , a country that above all others owes its success and power to the peaceful prosecution of industry and trade , is a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates or talks of war ; and it should cause every representative of the American people in the federal administration or in the federal Congress to proceed with prudeuce and deliberation before committing the country to a conflict certain to end in disaster on all sides , and likely to lead to the complete transfer of the commercial supremacy of the world from the English-speaking races to the Frenchman , the German and the Slav . " I believe that there is here , at least , little or no sympathy with the thoughtless jingoism that would set one branch of the English race to fight the other , and thus bring on the greatest and most disastrous war of modern times . " * * The business men have been true to Senator Hoar 's confidence . So have the workingmen of the country . While the author of Ben Hur , " a tale of the Christ , "  --  the same who was assuring us a year ago that the Turks could be trusted to act piously in Armenia ,  --  was screaming his readiness to organize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annex to the republic everything to the North Pole , and while that noble patriot , David Hill , was hastening to get disabilities removed from Southern brigadiers , and regiments of Texas veterans were reported ready for battle , from the workingmen of America , from the Labor Unions and other organizations , there came only words of friendship for their kin beyond the sea , only words of condemnation for the wantonness by which we had been plunged into the outer circles of the possibility of fratricidal strife . * * * If the business men of the country justified Senator Hoar 's confidence , and the workingmen made a nobler record still , so was the religious sentiment of the country true to his expectations . Never was the American pulpit truer to its high calling , and never did it bring itself to bear upon public opinion at a critical juncture with a more potent and united voice , than on the Sunday following the President 's message , the day following that on which Senator Hoar spoke at Plymouth . It was the Sunday before Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everett , speaking at the Jay centennial , concluded a powerful denunciation of the war fever , the first be it remembered to his honor which had been spoken in any high place , with these stirring words : " We shall in less than a week be celebrating all over this country the birth of the Saviour of mankind . Jesus was born at a time of profound peace , so grateful to a world that had been racked with war for a century , that men worshipped as a god the crafty emperor who achieved it . From a hundred thousand churches next Wednesday will be repeated the angels ' song , Peace on earth , good will towards men . ' Let no man who still holds to his Christian profession dare to enter a house of prayer next Wednesday , or ask his children to dance in glee round a tree resplendent with the gifts of // Christ 's birthday , if he is giving the lie to his Master 's religion by seeking national honor and the elevation of humanity in the horrors , cruelties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American church had spoken ; and there was hardly a discordant note . We quote a passage from the published sermon of Rev. Charles G. Ames of Boston , " War or Peace ? " because it is representative of the spirit of every significant sermon which came from the New England pulpit on that solemn day . Louis Kossuth said , There is not yet a Christian nation . ' Indeed , most of the nations that are called Christian , and which for centuries have been tinder nominal Christian instruction , are great military camps . Year after year there is no hour of any night when thousands of sentinels are not standing guard or pacing to and fro , ready to give alarm to the great armies of men who alxvays sleep within easy reach of their guns . . . . Shall we follow the older nations in the path to ruin , or lead them in the way of welfare and happiness ? A majority of the newspapers , millions of citizens , and both Houses of Congress accepted it as the instant dictate of patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if England does not settle her dispute with Venezuela in accordance with the findings of a commission to be appointed by us , we will resist by every means in our power . ' These are strong words : they draw the issue sharply , and they put in peril the peace of three nations . " The president would have done his whole duty by laying the facts before Congress , without accompanying them with a menace . To threaten Iirst , and inquire afterward ,  --  is this the way of good neighborhood ? " The passions are quick ; reason is slow ; the judicial faculty is slowest of all . Raise a war-cry , on any ground or on no ground , and immediately thousands are seized with a contagious military fever . If there are some smouldering embers of an old ancestral grudge , the least breath of jingoism will rekindle the fires ; and men will really imagine that hatred of another country is love of their own . The anarchist who flings a dynamite bomb and kills a few policemen is justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread penalty overtakes him , no man is less deserving of pity . But , before the bar of heaven , I would rather take his risks than to stand in the place of the men who gloat over the prospect of a war , or who study to embroil the nations for the sake of political capital or for the chances of plunder . " Mr. Hoar and Mr. Matthews and Mr. Ames represent the best political , business and religious feeling of New England . In the educational and literary realms New England has spoken with as true and firm a voice . We could call many noble representatives to witness . We shall only cite words of Professor Francis G. Peabody of Harvard University , and John Fiske , our most eminent historian . Said Professor Peabody , in an eloquenf address to the young men of Harvard on " The Greater Puritanism , " on Forefathers ' Day " Into the midst of this national lightmindedness , which talks of the inconceivable horrors of war with next of kin as if it were an international sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Puritan was not afraid to fight . As he stands here before us , he has his sword girt on his side and his flint-lock is in his hand . But he is afraid to do wrong . He would not dare to fight for any cause that is unjust or superfluous . He is not a freebooter , looking for a chance for glory : he is a good soldier of Jesus Christ , taking orders for a holy war . His commonwealth rests , not on bluster , but on righteousness ; and his legislators are chosen under this counsel of John Robinson : Whereas you are to become a body political , let your wisdom and godliness appear by choosing such persons as do entirely love and // will diligently promote the common good . And this duty yon may the more willingly and conscionably perform because you are to have those only for governors which yourself shall make choice of for that work . ' " Do not let us mistake the lesson of the present issue . A conntry like this is not likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well face the evidence that its permanence is not yet beyond the possibility of disaster . One condition of prosperity no nation is strong enough to defy  --  the necessity for soberness , consistency and self-control . Republics quite as strong as this , in comparison with the powers of their own age , have had their day and have ceased to be . The real perils among us are internal  --  a soft theory of life , a limp literature , reckless politics and conscienceless competition . These are foes which no navy is large enough to repel , and no coast defence strong enough to exclude . The stability of the republic rests just where the Pilgrims planted it , on the rock of a national conscience ; and the only secure coast defence is along the line of the stern and rock-bound coast of righteousness . " Mr. Fiske xvrote to the Twentieth Century Club of Boston , a few days afterwards , the following plain and manly words " It is high time that the wickedness , the silliness and the vulgarity of all This jingoism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thoughtful patriot blush for shame to behold the spectacle for gods and men which our country has been making of herself during the past ten days . People are apt to speak of the United States as a young ' nation . One of the least agreeable aspects of youthfulness is that which we have now been exhibiting . We have been behaving like the schoolboy who goes up and down among his fellows with a chip on his shoulder , vociferating , I can lick any one of you . ' With young male animals a brief period of such aimless belligerency seems unavoid able ; but when grown-up men indulge themselves in such pranks we stigmatize them as bullies . Men of sense do not regard sxvagger and tall talk as indications either of wisdom or of good breeding ; when applied to questions concerning which there may be room for dispute , they are apt to indicate that the swaggerer has a weak case . " Jingoism is by some thoughtless people called Americanism . ' In truth nothing could be more un-American . There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln , would have more emphatically condemned . The noble example which our country has set before the world has been the example of a vast federation in which states no less than individuals are amenable to the laws . Our whole federal system has been for a century the most pacific system the world has ever seen , and in this has lain its true dignity and glory as well as its unexampled prosperity . Upon this prosperity we are wont to pride ourselves ; we exult in the growth of our resources , the vastness of our strength , till we are in danger of being led astray by the mere impetus of our magniloquence . Unless justly , morally and decently used , our strength is no credit to us . If that vast strength were to be pressed into the service of jingoism , it would simply result in making the United States a pest and nuisance among nations . With the possession of advantages goes the moral obligation to use them properly . But , indeed , the people of the United States have no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacific in disposion as any people in the world ; and although a false appeal to national pride may call forth for the moment a false note of response the sober second thought comes quickly to their aid . There are few Americans who would welcome war , save sundry crude politicians , who may fancy that they descry some political benefit to themselves in a renewal of war tariffs and an inconverti // ble paper currency . Much of the jingo talk of the last two years has come from such a source and it has served as a political trap into which it is melancholy to see certain persons blindly walking , from whom better things had been expected . " There is one tone through all these various utterances representing what is best in the political , commercial , literary , religious and educational thought of New England  --  the tone of sanity , of dignity , of fraternity , of peace , of reason . They are the words of men who realize what is of real moment in the grave issue with which the nation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Monroe doctrine . The controversy of the diplomats and then the popular controversy rages about the Monroe doctrine . What was the Monroe doctrine ? It was a doctrine stated by President Monroe , acting in express concert with the great English minister Canning , at a time when there was grave danger that the " Holy Alliance " ( of Prussia , Austria and Russia ) , embodying the reactionary and ultra monarchical policy which followed the Napoleonic wars , would seek the control of South America , as i t was already interposing in the internal affairs of Spain . Our young republic , valuing so dearly its own liberties , and inspired by the high resolve that the American continent should be devoted to free institutiOns , declared through President Monroe that as " the political system of the allied powers was essentially different from that of America , " arid as it was " impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent North or South America without endangering our peace and happiness , " therefore " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety , " and " could not view any interposition " with the independent South American states , " for the purpose of oppressing them , or controlling in any other manner their destiny , by any European power , in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards the United States . " " The American continents " - this was the general priticiple stated - " are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers . " This is the famous Monroe doctrine . It was the declaration , in a serious crisis , of a policy of defence against the extension in America of political institutions opposed to ours and therefore " dangerous to our peace and safety . " We have heard of no eminent special student of our constitutional history and diplomacy who admits the application of the doctrine to the dispute in Venezuela . Professor Burgess and Professor Moore of Columbia College , Woolsey at Yale , Hart , Thayer and McVane at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken sweepingly against any such interpretation ; almost no disinterested scholar has been found willing to reanforce by his authority the appeal of the partial politician . The argument that the spread of English institutions over three hundred miles of South America is dangerous to our peace and safety , because forsooth England is a " monarchy , " is an argument unworthy of any man who has got beyond the kindergarten of history and politics . England is a monarchy only in name , as Venezuela is a republic only in name . The political institutions of England to-day are as free and democratic as our own , a hundred times as free , progressive and worthy of our confidence and favor as those of any South American republic controlled-or uncontrolled-by Portuguese and Spaniards . In the whole history of diplomatic correspondence - we wish to say it deliberately-we know of no observation so poor and shallow or , in view of the relations of England to Canada , so insulting , as // that of Secretary Gluey to the British minister , that " distance and three thousand miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an American state unnatural and inexpedient . Europe as a whole is monarchical , while America is devoted to the opposite principle , that of self government . Whether moral or material interests be considered , it can not but be universally conceded that those of Europe are irreconcilably diverse from those of America . " How many miles of ocean do our politicians consider many enough to make political union unnatural and inexpedient ? Is Hawaii too far away from us for it ? Is Cuba too far ? Is our Secretary suggesting to Great Britain that she give up her political relations with British Guiana ? This whole extraordinary statement proceeds from a view of history and of facts which belongs to the time of Andrew Jackson . England is a country as devoted to the principle of self government as our own ; France is a republic ; and all the nations of western Europe , so far from being , as Secretary Olney 's words imply , in the political condition in which they were in the days of James Monroe , so far from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are advancing in the great march of political , social and industrial freedom , in the establishment of enlightened principles and the working out of courageous and great experiments , in a manner which should make every one of us earnestly seek to bring America into the closest and most fraternal and organic relations with them , and which command us quite as often to be humble learners as to play the part of teachers and lecturers . * * * But is this all ? By no means . Whatever James Monroe said or did not say , we are a member of the great family of nations and of the family of American nations in particular . It was a part of the Monroe doctrine that , as we would permit no European intervention in American affairs , so we would not intervene in the affairs of Europe . May it be long before we are called upon for any such intervention ! But we should understand , our politicians as well as the rest of us , that the old hard and fast distinction between the Eastern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quincy Adams and James Monroe , has forever passed away . It is an antiquated distinction . An exigency may arise to-morrow , in Turkey , *n Russia , in China , in western Europe , which may command us , for our own sake , or by our common obligation to humanity , to make our influence felt . The steamship , the cable , travel , trade , everything which makes the modern world , bring Europe every day into closer relations with us than South America is . The ocean , so far from being a barrier between the continents , as Secretary Olney thinks , is now a bridge . Englishmen , Frenchmen , Germans , and Scandinavians , their borders overflowing , will not forever leave the great continent of South America , a continent forty times as large as France , fertile , of exhaustless mineral resources , salubrious , with great rivers flowing to the sea , a continent richer , more attractive and more promising far than Africa ,  --  the great peoples of Europe , we say , will not and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of restless , revolutionary and incompetent Portuguese and Spaniards . the very people of all European peoples who have least enterprise , least industry , least capacity for administration , least genius for that self government which Secretary Olney talks about so arrogantly and so poorly understands . Let us not be the dog in the manger to prevent the utilization and civilization of South America and that extension there of the best European forces which is both natural and expedient . Let not the voice of New England , above all , join in the decree that an American continent shall forever remain New Spain . // Yet let us never be unfaithful to the obligations of good neighborhood ; nothing commands that . Let us not see injustice done to any weaker sister by any imperious power . John Bull has all too often been greedy and a bully . Lowell told him so in those troublous times of thirty years ago in lines which Englishmen will not forget and Americans are not ashamed of . England does not resent those lines , and will not resent our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there is a John Bull , and she will quickly enough find her voice in the present exigency . Had Mr. Gladstone instead of Lord Salisbury been prime minister of England , we should have heard nothing of this refusal to submit the Venezuelan dispute to arbitration , which refusal was indeed a reversion of a compact substantially concluded by a former Liberal government . The English people will meet the American people half way in the rational and peaceful solution of a problem which has been precipitated before most of them as suddenly and unexpectedly as before most of us . The tone of the English press and people throughout this whole unhappy crisis has been self controlled , considerate , kind and worthy , in striking contrast with the violence and fever which marked so much speech and action among ourselves . There has been nothing to indicate any hostile sentiment whatever against us among the people of England .. The warlike words of which in that insane week so many went from us to them came to them clearly as a painful surprise . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming to Washington , " to see the feeling of enmity existing in the United States against Great Britain . There is no such feeling in our country , I can assure you , against America . " If the correspondent would leave Washington , he would quickly be able to inform his journal , which has done such conspicuous service among the newspapers of London to establish a right understanding between the two countries , that the atmosphere of Washington is not the atmosphere of the United States . * * * What then ought our Government to have done upon the reception of the British minister 's note refusing arbitration of the Venezuelan claims ? It should have told him plainly a very simple thing . It should have told him that , in the opinion of the American people , such a refusal was not in accord with the best sentiment of the modern world , and that our duty to a weaker sister republic , unable to cope with a great power , and entitled by all American traditions to look to us for protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of that international tribunal which we urged and which Great Britain , if conscious of the justice of her claims , should have been forward to grant , it became our duty to create a commission to give our own people exact information upon the facts and to submit its verdict to the judgment of civilized mankind . Does any serious man believe that the conclusions of such a commission , its personnel precisely that of the commission just created , supported as those conclusions would be by a complete historical and legal argument , would be ignored by the people of England , or by the government of England ? If they were ignored , then would have been time for action . Such action would have been a triumph of diplomacy , as in this latter day simplicity and manliness and courtesy alone are . It would have effected that wise thing which Samuel Adams , in the more serious circumstances of a hundred years ago , 1-ways counselled and always practised : it would have " kept the enemy in the wrong . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have maintained the good name of the republic and kept her still // at the front , in this day when the men of vision and great-mindedness the wide world over are laboring to make the groaning nations ground their arms and be friends , as the great champion and exemplar of international reason , good manners and crood will . By its hasty and utterly uncalled for threat of war , stirring up as was inevitable all the bad passions and prejudices of our people , and compelling as it has already done talk of costly armaments , new battle-ships , a doubled army , a war footing , adding to the sum total of the sense of insecurity and discord which shackles struggling mankind , the President 's message has given the republic a blow as a factor in civilization and the progress of the world for which much indeed will be required to make atonement . The common sense of the country , codperating with the common sense of England , will avert the ultimate disaster which would have been so easy and so certain with peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand how any serious man can have seen and heard what was seen and heard in that sad week before Christmas , and not feel the danger and the wrong to the nation of such a course as that witnessed at Washington . It is not the part of a patriot to be silent in such a crisis ; that is a bastard patriotism . The measure of my love for any institution , said Arnold of Rugby , is the measure of my desire to reform it . The measure of our love for our country should be the measure of our desire to keep it true to its own highest ideals and to restore it to the right when it *s wrong . Our duties as citizens are no less chivalric and noble than our duties as gentlemen ; and a gentleman is never more a gentleman than when he says : I have done wrong , I am to blame . * * It is not a question of the Monroe doctrine . Differ as we may about that , few would care to criticise the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the deep question of the reckless appeal to the war spirit in a great nation . It is not a question primarily of blaming the administration . It is a question of the bluster and brag and swagger of which we have seen and heard so much from a certain class of our politicians during the last five years ,  --  politicians , be it plainly said , at a time when the President is the subject of so much criticism , not chiefly of his party . The people have indulged these displays of pinchbeck patriotism , these appeals to national vanity and selfishness and greed , these partisan and brutal promptings to aggressiveness and war , until great classes were made drunk by them , and a portentous mass of dangerous and inflammable sentiment had been rolled up , which needed but a match to start a conflagration . We can not but believe that the American people will learn the lesson , and that the levity and wickedness of which we have had so much will cease to be tolerated longer among sober men . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless war talk leads and to clear the air , it will not have been wholly vain or wholly bad . * * * Washington , in his farewell address , warned the country in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party . Few dangers threaten a democracy so great as those from great contesting parties which , once vital and sincere , born for high and special purposes , outlive their vocation and continue on by the sheer momentum of great organization . Fictitious issues must be created and magnified antagonisms maintained for partisan and campaign needs . The real and crying evils in the country , which call for the attention of every man with any claim to patriotism or statesmanship , are neglected and ignored ; and Satan always finds some work for idle hands-as he has now proved once again . Had our great // parties had their activities and zeal engrossed in the great work of social and indnstrial reform which so imperatively commands attention , there wonld have been no time and no temptation for the jingoism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil to the conntry and the world . An address from the leading men of letters in England to their brethren in America was pnblished in London on Christmas day . The address was signed by more than a thousand representative men-Rnskin , John Morley , Walter Besant , Alfred Anstin , the new poet lanreate , William Watson , and the hundred kindred names which Americans hold dear . It was an address full of fraternity and confidence and admiration , of appeal to the great past and of high hope for the fntnre achievements of the nnited AngloSaxon race . " For two such nations to take np arms against each other would be civil war . " From every American man of letters , from every earnest man , let the word be echoed back in one great chorns .
