txt The first feeling of those who went to Poughkeepsie on Friday to see a boat race , and saw only a shell broken by the wash of a steamer , or , rather , of those who have read the accounts of the business , must be one of indignation against the boorish fool who brought about this lamentable result , and a desire to have him properly punished . At the same time , It must be observed that a racing shell Is a very fragile machine , and extremely liable to accident , and that it is very improvident for a college crew to undertake a race without providing itself - ssith a spare boat . It might very well be one of the conditions of future races that the contestants should provide themselves with such boats , and that the lack of a boat should not be accepted as an excuse for not racing . But it was not one of the conditions this time , and we can only hope that the crews will have better luck next time , though it is probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flssembled to look at them . A Montreal court has just decided that " Methodist " is an epithet which , ei lien applied by one French-Canadian editor to another , inflicts damages to the amount of $200 . It is extremely well to have delicate points like this definitely settled by a competent authority . On this side of the border the term in question is not usually reg-atcled as opprobrious ; most people , indeed , would hesitate to apply it to the average States journalist , but rather because his denominational status is usually a matter of wild uncertainty than from any fear of the libel laws . In many cases , we suspect , the Church would be more likely to claim compensation than the editor . Of course , the conditions are widely different in Canada . and it is not the intention to intimate here that the Montreal decision is in any way unjust . Still , it would be interesting to hear what such Methodists as there may be in the Province of Quebec think of the matter . The Cuban patriots have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no basis in fact for the rumored shooting of Martinez Campos . The old General , it seems , is still very much alive . and is as hard at work as ever , and as successfully , in putting down the rebellion . This is the same as saying that the rebel farces continue , slowly but surely , advancing westward , and now have practical peasession of three provinces instead of one . At the present rate of progress it will take them about a year to reach the western extremity of the island , and they will Chen be in a good position to claim recognition as belligerents . Campos is a veteran with a deserved reputation for energy and military skill , but it is founded wholly on achievements in the somewhat distant past . The present campaign , certainly , has added nothing to his fame , for , though he came to Cuba with a great flourish of trumpets and promised a speedy restoration of peace , it is difficult to see that he has accomplished anything whatever . Not long ago the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made the remarkable statement that reforms ? he was talking about the army. ? should be made when their absolute necessity was obvious , but until that point was reached things had better be allowed to go on as they were . Many Englishmen have long been of the opinion that of all thc many reforms needed by the British Army . none was quite so desperately imperative as the removal of this maundering* old representative of royalty from the post of its Commander in Chief . At last he has resigned . There is a report that he had no idea his resignation would be accepted , and is vastly annoyed because it was , but that feature of the case is of no appreciable moment . The important fact is that the Duke is out for good and all . Under a new and better regime , however , Tommy Atkins may be a less picturesque subject for Mr. Kipling 's genius to work upon . That will probably be the only basis for any regrcts , over the too-long-delayed shelving of a mart whose one title to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth .
