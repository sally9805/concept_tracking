txt Six expert accountants entered the Auditor 's office of the Chicago , Indianapolis and Louisville Railroad to-day , and commenced an examination of the company 's books and accounts . Who these examiners are or who they represent nobody knows , not even Auditor Daugherty . That they are examining the financial condition of the " Monon " for the Morgan-Vanderbilt interests is surmised by those who have been watching the Big Four-Monon deal . Some time ago it was currently reported and the report semi-officially confirmed that the financiers back of the Big Four and the Chesapeake and Ohio were seeking the purchase of the Monon for the purpose of consolidating it with the system composed of the first two roads . For a time the deal seemed to have fallen through , but the quiet arrival of the six accountants in the Monon 's office has revived the report of a sale of the road . That a big railroad deal for one Chicago road and perhaps two is on few doubt . The " Monon " and the Eastern Illinois are the lines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not definitely known . When the Big Four made an attempt to get the Eastern Illinois several years ago , the books of the latter road were gone over in the same manner in which the " Monon 's " affairs are now being investigated . While the Baltimore and Ohio is after the Eastern Illinois , the Morgan-Vanderbilt people are after the " Morton , " for the purpose of consolidating it with the Big Four , and doing away with a part of the bitter and ruinous competition . In addition to smothering this competition , the Vanderbilts would get magnificent terminals in this city for their Southwestern system , for the " Monon , " like the Eastern Illinois , got into Chicago early and secured fine locations for its freight houses and yards .
