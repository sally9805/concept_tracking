txt We published two or three weeks ago the reports submitted to the Marine Hospital Bureau by Dr. Kinyoun concerning the use of the blood-serum remedy for diphtheria in Paris and Berlin , where he had pursued his investigations for three months . Since his return from Europe Dr. Kinyoun has made some experiments in the treatment of smallpox with the serum of a vaccinated heifer . " It has been already demonstrated by Maurice Raynaud and Sternberg , " he says in his account of these experiments , " that the blood serum of an immune animal destroys the potency of vaccine lymph . It had occurred to me , as well as to others , that this fact could be utilized in the treatment of smallpox by injections of this serum . " On Dec. 23 he took a liter of blood from a heifer which had been vaccinated on Nov. 26 . Having drawn off the serum and filtered -a part of it , he added pure vaccine lymph to both the filtered and the unfiltered , and then inoculated a heifer with each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results being negative in both instances . A considerable quantity of the filtered serum was sent to the physician in charge of the smallpox hospital in Washington , with the suggestion that it should be used in fresh cases before the stage of pustulation . There was no opportunity , however , to use it in such cases , but the ' serum was administered to two patients in the pustular stage . In the case of one patient four injections of fifteen cubic centimeters each were given , with the effect , as reported , of modifying slightly 11 the course of the malady , but thi pa , tient died two days later . In the other case 105 cubic centimeters were injected in forty-eight hours , apparently with favorable effect , and this patient recovered . Commenting upon his record of the cases , the physician in charge says : " It is very unfortunate that cases did not present themselves until the eruption was well developed into the pustular stage , since it is before this period- of the disease that the serum would have an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe the use of the serum in these two cases has given good results . The injections were given under the most careful aseptic precautions . The change in the appearance of the pustular eruption was noticeable after the first eighteen hours . It is my opinion that the vaccine serum ? will shorten the course of variola if given in the papular stage of the eruption . The serum does modify the variolous eruption , even in the pustular stage , but does not shorten the attack . " The first of the two cases was that of a patient . whose condition at the time of his admission to the hospital ' unfavorable , as he then had a malignant form of the disease , with confluent eri.M tion ; and was delirious : The:record indicates that the ? injections caused some temporary improvement , but ibis evident that this patient was beyond the reach of remedies . In the other case the injections appear to have : ' been followed by quite perceptible improvement in pulse and respiration ; also with respect to the albumen ' measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There were no inaCiiiions , " says the physician , " that there : vir oulcil* any pitting , whereas two other cases , not receiving the serum , to all appearances identical with this one , will be ' badly marked . " Dr. Kinyoun says : " From the history . of the two cases treated with the serum , it appears that it does have a modifying , effect upon the disease , especially upon the eruption . I am informed by Dr. Elliot that it was his belief that by administering the serum to the first case life was prolonged at least seventy-two hours . Since it appears possible to modify the pustular stage of smallpox , and in this case to have little or no pitting follow , it certainly appears reasonable to assume that the treatment would have even a greater power over the disease in its first stages . Since it seems possible to mitigate the attack of variola , it also appears rational to presume that the serum would have Power to render susceptible persons refractory to the disease . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful application of the antitoxine theory to cases of smallpox , but it is unwise to assume anything on the basis of apparent improvement in only one case , or at the most only two cases . The data thus supplied are insufficient and may be . misleading . For the production of serum hostile to smallpox there may be- required a method more elaborate . than the drawing of the blood of a heifer which has been vaccinated once and has recovered from the perceptible effect of this vaccination . The fact that inoculation with a fluid composed of this serum in combination with vaccine lymph does not produce the disease in one heifer is not enough in itself to prove that the serum in question neutralizes the lymph or the poison of the disease . It is not improbable , however , that further experiments , made by Dr. Kinyoun or others , will lead to the production and use of an antitoxic serum , hostile to smallpox , that will greatly mitigate the severity of this disease , if applied in the early stages , and considerably reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves by vaccination and are attacked by it .
