txt A dispatch from one of the officers of the United States revenue cutter Bear says that vessel is fast on the rocks at the entrance to the harbor of Sitka and is almost a total wreck . It is conjectured that the vessel will be battered to pieces . The cutter was plowing her way into the harbor at good speed on the night of May 29 when she struck on a rock , and all efforts Revenue Cutter Bear . to get her off were unavailing . She went on at high tide . Her officers state that they have very little hope of saving the vessel . Her ? stern was the part to suffer most , and the dispatch says that her rudder , propeller , and sternpost were gone , and in a sea the vessel must surely break up , as it would be impossible for her to stand any amount of pounding on the jagged points of the rock an - which shp rests . The Bear left San Francisco about six weeks ago to join the Bering Sea fleet to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of freight for the naval supply stations at . Point Clarence and Point Barry , and if it is lost the cutters will necessarily be short of supplies unless another vessel is sent up with the necessary cargo . No lives were reported lost . WASHINGTON , June ** news sent from San Francisco this morning , that the revenue cutter Bear had been wrecked in the Arctic Ocean , was received at both the Navy Department and Treasury Department with expressions of surprise and doubt . No official news of the wreck had reached either the Navy or Treasury Department up to 1 P. M. to-day . The Bear was on her way to Point Barrow , the extreme northern part of Alaska , with supplies for that station and other points in Northern Alaska . The Bear left Port Townsend May 5 , in charge of Capt . Healey , and had a complement of eight officers and forty men . She is a vessel classed as first-class , 703 tons burden , 198 feet in length , 50 feet beam , 17 feet draught , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , In 1872 , and and was subsequently presented to the United States in acknowledgment of the efforts of this Government to discover traces of Sir John Franklin . She was transferred to the Treasury Department cutter service in March , 1885 , and has been in Constant use since , having made several trips to the seal islands . Her commander , Capt . Healey , is an officer of long experience and familiar with Arctic seas . Up to the closing hour of the department no official dispatch had been received either by Secretary Carlisle or Capt . Shepard of the Revenue Marine Service , under whose immediate control the revenue cutter Bear is , or by the Navy Department , confirming the very circumstantial report of the wreck of the vessel telegraphed from San Francisco . The nearest telegraph station to Sitka is Departure Bay , E. C. , from seven to ten days ' steaming from Sitka . Capt . Shepard , however , is unable to account for the presence of the Bear at Sitka at this time . The last report from Capt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Rev. Sheldon Jackson had completed the object of his visit in connection with the introduction of reindeer on the islands , the Bear would sail in pursuance of department instructions received at Port Townsend . These instructions directed the Bear to visit Prince William 's Sound , Cook 's Inlet , and Shumagin Islands , en route to Unelaskl , the seal Islands , and Point Barrow . The fact that from Capt . Healy 's report the Bear should haVe sailed from Sitka on May 19 makes her presence in the harbor on May 29 inexplicable . Capt . Shepard , who has had extensive experience in these waters as the commander of the Rush , said that the waters at Silica Harbor are of sufficient depth to admit vessels of any draught , but that the channels are narrow , crooked , and beset with many sunken ledges , and for these reasons entrance is at all times difficult , and in thick weather , which prevails a great part of the time , hazardous .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
