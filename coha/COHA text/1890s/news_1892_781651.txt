txt Mr. Vest . ( Dem. , Mo. , ) made a statement in the Senate . to-day In refer-enoe to an assertion made by him in the Senate , July 6 , that the Arlington Woolen Mills had paid a dividend of 50 per cent . in 1891 , which assertion had been positively contradicted in a note from Mr. William Whitman , Treasurer of the Arlington Mills , that had been put in the Record last week by Mr. Allison , ( Rep. , Iowa . ) Mr. Whitman , in this note , stated that it was " absolutely false " that the Arlington Mills had paid 50 per cent . dividend in 1891 , and . had only paid 6'per cent . ; also that it was " absolutely false " that the Arlington Mills were in any way connected with a trust or that there had been any strikes or troubles among the workmen . Mr. Vest said he would undertake to show beyond the supposition of a doubt that Mr. Whitman 's statement was a suggestio fain . and that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was true that the Arlington /dills had " not declared " a dividend of 50 per cent . in 1891 ; but they had declared a dividend of 6 per cent . and had then put $900,000 into its surplus . He ( Mr. Vest ) demonstrated that the profits for the year 1891 were $932,809 ? equal to 50 per cent . He also read from Mr. Whitman 's annual reports to the Directors to show that the Arlington Mills had for several years earned over 25 per cent . And , in reference to Mr. Whitman 's denial of strikes and labor troubles , Mr. Vest sent to the Clerk 's desk and had road items from the Boston Herald and other newspapers showing that there were strikes at those mills , owing to low wages and hard work . Mr. Allison said that he bad no knowledge respooling the assets , liabilities , or profits of the Arlington Mills . He was sure , however , that there was some rational and reasonable explanation of those newspaper extracts . They must refer , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Whitman would have deliberately stated a falsehood and asked him to have it put in the Record . So far from showing that in 1891 the Arlington Mills made $900,000 profits , the report showed ( Mr. Allison contended ) that that sum was an accumulation of profits from the foundation of the corporation . Mr. Vest read from Mr. Whitman 's report of March , 1890 , as follows : " I have boon your Treasurer for a consecutive period of twenty years . During the period the average earnings have been 20.8 per cent . ou the capital . The earnings last year wore nearly throe and a half times those of the year before ; and there is every indication that the current year will be the most profitable one in the company 's history . " After some further discussion , the matter was allowed to drop .
