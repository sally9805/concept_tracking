txt The chief interest in the election in this city attaches to the candidacy of exJustice DALY for the Supreme Court . The Democrats and Republicans having joined in the renomination of Justice BARRETT , to the great satisfaction of an good citizens , the most important choice the voters have to make in connection with the judiciary is between Justice DALY , the Fusion candidate , and Mr. O'GonmAx , the Tammany candidate , for a seat on the Supreme Court bench . In that choice they are without distinct guidance from the source to which they are accustomed to look for advice in such matters . The Bar Association , after having made a practically unanimous effort to secure the renomination of Justice BARRETT , contents itself with a statement that both Messrs . Daly and O'GonMAN are good men for the place to which they are named as candidates , though ex-Justice DALY is on the whole the better . There are facts in the situation , however , which it will be well for the voters carefully to consider . Mr. O'GonmAlc is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of good character and of considerable ability . But it can not be said of him that his election Would advance the strength of the court , or the true principle on which its members ought to be selected . Ex-Justice DALY , on the other hand , has had wide and honorable experience in the court ; he is a Democrat , nominated by the Republicans , and is a conspicuous representative of the principle of absolute non-partisanship in the selection of the judiciary ; he is pledged to the highly important principle of refusing all Contributions for party purposes by judicial candidates . In a word , he now stands for precisely the ideals that were observed in the renomination of Justice BARRETT , and it would be well for the city if he could receive every vote of those that will be cast for the latter . This is impossible , but it is , in our judgment , the duty of those that desired and urged the renomination of Justice BARRETT to do all in their power to promote the election of Judge DALY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
