txt In a letter which we published yesterday Mr. Jom . R. Dos PASSOS , a well-known attorney of this city , asserted that " the cry against Trusts " was " demagogical , " and that " the Anti-Trust act of Congress " was " demagogical and useless . " He also said that the price of sugar had " been going down steadily since the formation of the Sugar Trust , under the influence of combined labor , experience , and skill of the people who were interested in " that organization . We have already shown that this assertion concerning the price of sugar was not in accordance with the facts . Recent events , as well as the decisions of courts in the last twenty or thirty years , furnish material for pertinent comment upon the assertion of Mr. Dos PASSOS that " the cry against Trusts is demagogical . " If Mr. Dos PAssos is right , the courts of this country have for many years been practicing the arts of the demagogue . They have uniformly declared that agreements designed to suppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public policy . Whenever the agreement or the fundamental contract of a . Trust or of a combination resembling a Trust has come before a court in any one of a dozen States which might be named , this has been the court 's decision . Among the latest decisions of this kind in this State were those of Judge BEACH with respect to the combination of the builders of iron bridges , and of Judge &WITH; in the Harrow Trust case . The reports for Ohio , New-York , Pennsylvania , California . Louisiana , Illinois , and other States present a formidable record of such demagogical utterances . The " cry against Trusts " has been repeated many times from the bench with all the emphasis which a " demagogical " purpose could suggest . The Supreme Court of Ohio exhibited its " demagogical " tendencies yesterday in a notable decision concerning one of the corporations in the Standard Oil Trust . This corporation was chartered in that State , and the Attorney General undertook to enforce against it the statutes of Ohio concerning the ? powers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General TABOR in this State against a corporation which had become a part of the Sugar Trust . We hade not a full report of the decision , but the court finds that the agreement between this corporation and . the other parts of the Trust is illegal , and prohibits this corporation " from continuing to carry out in any way or to fulfill any provisions or agreements tinder the Trust contract . " This is not the first time that the Supreme Court of Ohio has yielded to " demagogical " influences when required to deal with such a question . In Boston a , Federal Grand Jars ' and the United States District Attorney are interested in a " demagogical " attack upon what is commonly called the Whisky Trust , which is a Trust that changed its name when it procured a corporate charter in Illinois , hoping that this charter might serve as a cloak to conceal the unlawful character of its organization and operations . In pursuance of its " demagogical " purpose , this Grand Jury has indicted the officers of the Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted by a " demagogical " Congress and approved by a " demagogical " President , and the indicted persons have actually been arrested , just as if their Trust were not a philanthropic association formed in obedience to what our correspondent calls " the laws of supply and demand as they are illustrated through the various forms of business . " ? The indicted officers will now try to show that in this " age of concentration of capital , " to use the words of our correspondent , it is pure philanthropy to compel consumers to pay dividends to the owners of seventy-nine idle distilleries and upon an inflated capital of $35,000,000 , which represents a productive capacity which could be duplicated for less than $4,000,000 . These proceedings have been instigated by the Attorney General of the United States , whose " demagogical " inclinations have been developed by a contemplation of the Federal statute and the interpretation of the common law by the courts of the several States .                   @ @
