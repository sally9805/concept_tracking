txt Readers of the public prints are already aware of the surprising observations made on Sunday by the Rev. Dr. SUNDERLAND in the First Presbyterian Church of Washington . The sermon was preached by the Rev. Dr. SMITH of New-York , and was devoted to a consideration of the decline of Christianity in general and of Presbyterianism in particular . Of this the preacher gave some startling illustrations . The topic was an entirely natural one to choose for the occasion of the meeting in Washington of the Presbyterian General Assembly , and the sermon concluded with an " eloquent plea for union in the Church . " After it was ended , the pastor made his astonishing remarks , to wit : " I am sure we have all enjoyed Dr. SMITH 'S sermon this morning . But there is one important omission . He neglected to state the cause of the dissension and distraction in the Presbyterian Church at this time ? the reason why the Church has failed to accomplish what it ought to . I want here and now to state the cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that man 's shoes to-day for all the world . Let us sing Hymn No. 533 . " This was the Rev. Dr. SUNDERLAND 'S " eloquent plea for union in the Church " and his contribution to that end . In considering it , one is quite at a loss to know which of the dualities revealed by it most to admire . There is first the graceful tact of such an utterance , at a time when the " ? case " of Dr. BRIGGS is about to be brought before a tribunal of which the speaker is presumably a member . Then there is the Christian spirit in which one Christian minister considers the procedures of another . Finally , there is the strong good sense evinced in attributing to Dr. BRIGGS the decline of Presbyterianism and " the dissension and distraction in the Presbyterian Church at this time . " All these are tempting themes of comment , but the former two are rather awkward to handle , and we need only remark upon the last , the " sweet reasonableness " of attributing to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the decline of that Churoh . The truth is that the decline began before Dr. BRIGGS was born , certainly before he was admitted to the ministry , and that before he began to make any public , utterances about the Bible or about the Calvinistic doctrines it had become a very urgent question in the Presbyterian Church how the decline was to be averted . Mankind outside the Presbyterian ministry found the doctrines of CALVIN , as set forth in the Confession of Faith , revolting and incredible , and educated young men abstained in yearly increasing numbers from entering its ministry . It lost year by year many of those who had been bred in its communion , and it gained no compensating accessions from the outside . Yet all this while it was united and harmonious as well as stagnant or declining . It was absolutely plain that some new liner must be taken if the Church was to prosper , and that it must be brought more into conformity with the spirit of the age and with the opinions of the educated modern world . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dissension and distraction in the Church , " instead of the unity and harmony of which the Church was languishing . Dr. BRIGGS is one of the men who have ventured to say inside the ministry of the Presbyterian Church what all educated men were saying outside of that ministry . His attachment to the traditions and the name of the Church made him anxious to remain in its ministry , and to promote its progress by aerating and liberalizing and modernizing such of its doctrines as are obsolete and fantastic . That such a man " distracts " the Church may be true enough , but so far from contributing to its decline , ho is taking the only means possible to check that decline . If the sentiments of the Rev. Dr. SUNDERLAND prevail , the harmony of the Church may be temporarily restored by the expulsion of Dr. BRIGGS , and the consequent suppression of other like-minded but less courageous pastors , but the decline of the Presbyterian Church will continue at an accelerated rate .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
