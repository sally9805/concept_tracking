txt There is an article in the October number of Fetter 's Southern Magazine , a comparatively new periodical published in Louisville , about WHITTIER  --  an " appreciation " of him , as MT . PATER would say ? that arrests the attention . It is. of course , merely one man 's opinion of another man 's work , but all criticism is that ; and this is , in a certain way , good criticism , for it is evidently the product of the best judgment of a man who habitually thinks , and whose knowledge of his subject is sufficient . His vision , it seems to us , is obscured by certain strong prejudices , political and literary . With his political prejudices we have no concern . It does not surprise us in the least that a middle-aged Southerner who fought in the civil war can not speak of the abolition movement without showing his feeling . Thinking men in the North today can view this calmly . But the place this Southern critic gives to WHITTIER as a factor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too important . The good Quaker poet 's heart was from first to last with the cause of abolition , and he served it nobly . The value of his services was never underestimated by his associates . It is surely hyperbolical , however , to say of him that his anti-slavery poems were " written with a pen dipped in the heart 's blood of the South and tipped in the fire of its burning homes " ; that " the ambition of ALEXANDER and the craftiness of CIESAR combined never caused so much bloodshed as the poems of WHITTIER " ; that he wrote lines in which " every letter meant a grave and every syllable a family bereaved . " But not nearly so strange as this hyperbole is the Southern critic 's estimate of the literary value of WarrriEn 's poetry . It is higher than any other estimate we have Seen . He puts WHITTIER between COLERIDGE and WORDSWORTH ? " better than WORDSWORTH , less than COLERIDGE . " There is surely a smack of provincialism in this . It recalls to our mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For the Major " ? the people of a refined but blighted and benighted community , who ignored their present , and clung with pathetic earnestness to withered traditions . The judgment that , without reservation , ranks the poetry of the author of " Kubla Khan " above the best of WORDSWORTH is surely not in sympathy with the drift of modern criticism . It is not to be slighted , however . We have not quoted it to disparage it . Indeed , it is worthy of serious deliberation . It is a pleasure to know that the fame of WHITTIER is so secure in the South . We can not quite understand , though , why this writer should believe that for twenty years WHITTIER will not again be heard of , and that then people will begin to understand him . He does not seem to us to be the kind of poet whose fame will survive twenty years of neglect ; or to be in the least difficult to understand .               @ @ @ @ @ @
