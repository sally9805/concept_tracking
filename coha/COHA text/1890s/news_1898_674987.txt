txt There is ' one way in which the President can in some small degree atone to ' the country- for the inmienseloss. and suf. fering inflicted by the War Secretary whom he chose so rashly and has so foolishly kept . The time has now probably gone by when we can hope that Mr. .339-KIN= will do what before . all things he ought to do ? dismiss Mr. ALGER ; . and put a capable and devoted man in his place . But he may yet , if he will , provide that so much of the injury imposed on the Nation as is due , to faults of system shall be guarded against in the future . - The President can not doubt that the system is very faulty , or that the mischief wrought by it has been very great , ' that if we had had to contend with an enemy of real strength and capacity the mischief would have become disaster . A system under which the Secretary of War avows that he can not fix the responsibility for mistakes and mismanagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond all question , radically defective . When the Adjutant General , the Quartermaster General , the Commissary General , and the Surgeon General are all uniting with the Secretary in declaring that the best results possible were attained , this testimony is conclusive at least of this , that if the shameful results were the best possible , then the whole system is hopelessly bad and should be completely changed . One question , it is plain , the President must consider , and that is how the system can be reformed . In part , the reform will , of course , require legislation . In part it can be done under the authority of the President as Commander in Chief . In any case , it should be made the subject of careful study by experts , whose recommendations should receive the hearty and steadfast support of the President , and should not be allowed to be interfered with by the present Secretary of War . A commission of such experts it is quite within the I power of the President to employ . It should embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank , through whom he could with confidence communicate his views . It might with advantage include a former of Secretary of War , such a man as either Senator PROCTOR or Col. LAMONT . An officer who had had opportunity for study of foreign armies as well as service in our own and who possessed marked organizing ability , such as Major Gen. F. V. GREENE , would obviously be a valuable member . A civilian thoroughly versed in the business of transportation ? of whom many could be furnished by our great railway systems ? should be added . A physician who had made a study of the medical work of modern armies would be required . Such a commission would not be difficult to select , nor would it require a very great amount of time for its members to agree upon the general principles in accordance with which the reorganization of the military department of the United States should be carried on . If appointed this Fall they could be ready to report in time for action by the next Congress , so far as Congressional action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions that the President himself could carry out . It is needless to say that all politics or suspicion of politics should be avoided in the work , and that the commission should be such as to arouse no party feelings , but to command the respect of all .
