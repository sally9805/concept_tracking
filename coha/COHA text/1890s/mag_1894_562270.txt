txt THE question of an income tax is to the fore just now not in the United States only , for it is an exceedingly " live topic " in France also . It was an important plank in the Radical and Socialist platforms during the elections last summer for members of the Chamber of Deputies , and the conflicting views on this subject held by the different ministers of the Dupuy cabinet was the main cause of the parliamentary coup-de-th6atre which overturned that cabinet , and set up in December last the present Casimir-P*rier ministry . And in his Declaration read before the Chamber and Senate , even the new President of the Council did not turn his back on the advocates of an income tax , since , in proposing changes in the French fiscal system , so much in need of reform , he expressed the hope that an impost might be levied by which " acquired wealth would be particularly reached .

As far back as 1296 the publican turned towards the income , and the taxpayer was required to take an oath on the Bible that his declaration was truthful . A similar impost was voted by the States General as early as 1355 , and was reimposed at subsequent meetings of that body in succeeding years . After the wars of the Fronde , in the middle of the seventeenth century , the finances of the kingdom had fallen into such a lamentable condition that the king , in despair , looked for help in an income tax . One of the clauses of the proposed measure declared that all subjects who should make a false declaration would have their property confiscated . But the Duke of Orleans considered the project impracticable and it wasabandoned . In 1710 , however , a tax of this kind was imposed and collected , a quarter of the income being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advent , eighty years later , of the levelling spirit of the Revolution , nobles , clergy , and people were placed , by the royal decree which established this tax , on the same footing . But this action caused violent protests in the two first . named classes , which were carried to such excesses that St. Simon refers to the dispute as " a bloody affair . " This tax was continued for several years . Under the old regime , however , the higher orders generally succeeded in pushing off the burdens of taxation on to the burgers and people , which is , doubtless , one of the hidden causes why modera France has never taken kindly to an income tax of the orthodox stamp . M. Leroy-Beaulieu , one of the leading French political economists , says in his " Trait* de icr Science des Finances , " when he speaks of the income tax : // " The difficulties in the way of its establishment are very great . They spring in part from our democratic conditions , political divisions , and administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic , where there is a tendency for government to fall into the hands of the working classes and their representatives , than in a monarchy , whether it be absolute or limited . " The reflection made in the last sentence is as applicable to the United States as to France , and explains why the French Conservatives of the past and the moderate Republicans of to-dayhesitate to enter upon a line of legislation advocated by the " representatives " of " the working classes , " as M. Leroy-Beaulieu well describes , without intending it , the Radical and Socialist Deputies of the present hour . There is a strong strain of sentimentality running through French politics even to day , and it was rampant in 1789 . It shows itself especially in fiscal legislation . Thus , in the celebrated Address to the French on the Payment of Taxes , * issued by the revolutionary fathers in 1791 , the word " contribution , " instead of the word " imp6t " of the ancient regime , is used throughout the document , for , we are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer contributions to the public treasury . And several paragraphs of the address are devoted to an enumeration and condemnation of the various ways in which the tax-gatherers of the king used to violate " that holy law of domiciliary liberty . " This feeling has repeatedly shown itself whenever the establishment of an income tax has been proposed in France . At such times the average Frenchman is disposed to make much the same reply as this of the Englishman who was testifying before a committee of inquiry on the income tax : " To go and ask somebody , What is your income ? ' is not the role of a gentleman . " So every time a deputy has suggested empowering*the tax-gatherer to put an important question of this kind , the proposal has always been received with great disapprobation . In 1871 Casimir-Pdrier , father of the present Prime Minister , said , in his report in the name of the Budget Committee , that the minority was opposed to the measure because " it saw therein the germ of a system of inquisition into private affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  the very ends sought for by the French Radicals and Socialists who are now demanding the establishment of an income tax . The history of France shows that propositions of this kind are generally brought forward at moments of crisis and political instability . During the Republic of 1848 two Ministers of Finance proposed such a tax , but the propositions did not become laws . That arch-socialist , Proudhon , who was a member of the Constituent Assembly at this period , urged that all incomes from real and personal property be taxed one-third . Its collection was to be left to the diligence of tenants and debtors . Of course such a bill stirred up a tumult , and when the excited legislators came to a vote , only Proudhon and a single other member held up their hands in favor of the project . Two or three times during the Second Empire an income tax of some description was talked of , but never put into effect , and when the National Assembly met at Bordeaux , after the Franco-German war , this same tax was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , A score of * This address will be found in the appendix to a volume published by Guillanmm &amp; Co. , Paris , entitled LImpOt Bit ?

The main purpose of them all was to exempt landed property , which , however , is well able to pay more , at the expense of personal property , and all were voted down . Every proposal to increase the land tax was also negatived . The upshot of all these debates was a slight augmentation of the tax on licenses , while an additional seven hundred millions of francs was secured by indirect taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet with much favor in France is due , perhaps , to the fact that an impost of this kind , resembling , at least , the one which prevails in England , does not differ materially from the four main French " direct contributions , " which are a tax , not on any particular class of incomes , but on incomes in general . These consist of the land , house , and furniture tax , and the door and window tax . But the ratepayer is not subjected to an inquisitional declaration of any kind . All leases have to be registered , and as the rent one pays is a pretty safe guide as to the amount of one 's income , this figure is taken as the basis for the tax list of a large portion of the inhabitants of France . It may be called an indirect income tax . The fiscal battle in France has always been and is still waged between the advocates of direct and indirect taxation . Under the ancient regime the States General favored direct taxation . Sully and Colbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged classes could thus be reached . With the exception of Norway , France is of all modern European states the one where the proportion of indirect taxes is the largest . In the time of Francis I. *l515-1547 ) fifty per cent . of the taxes were of an indirect nature . At the end of the reign of Louis XL , in 1483 , the figure had been twenty-two per cent . But under Louis XIV . ( 1643-1715 ) there were years when 175 to 100 was the proportion between indirect and direct taxes . In Necker 's budget , presented on the eve of the French Revolution , the figures stood at about 115 to 100 . The National Assembly had an antipathy for a system which it considered undemocratic , and the order of the figures was soon reversed , direct taxation furnishing the larger sum to the nation 's treasury . In the budget of 1791 the indirect taxes formed sixty-six per cent . of the whole amount , and it soon fell to fifty-one per cent . Under the Consulate it rose to ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to direct taxes was as 143 to 100 , about the same as in the time of Colbert . During the reign of Louis Philippe the figure was 173 ; during the Second Republic 168 , and the average during the Second Empire was as high as 225 . To-day , for every franc of direct , a Frenchman pays six in indirect taxes . It was indirect taxation which furnished nearly all the money necessary to pay Germany the war indemnity of $1,600,000,000 in 1871 . Thiers was always an ardent supporter of indirect taxation . But , then , it was he who said that " political economy is a tiresome literature , " and that " statistics is the art of being precise about what one knows nothing of . " The late President Grdvy , on the other hand , was opposed to this system , and as far back as 1849 voted against the re-establishment of the liquor tax , because he held that it was contrary to the principle of proportionality in matters of taxation . Thus have French statesmen long been divided on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the republican form of government is firmly established in France and parties have the leisure to study economic questions more completely ; now that // the country is becoming more and more democratic , and the Socialists are securing such a strong foothold in the chamber , indirect taxation , which falls so heavily on the poor , must sooner or later give way to increased direct taxation . In fact M Casimir-P6rier speaks out plainly in this sense in the Declaration already mentioned , and M. Yves Guyot , in the work which has been cited shows clearly that such a reform can be introduced with perfect justice to all concerned , since landed property is not paying its share . In this way the Moderate Republicans hope to checkmate the Radicals and Socialists , and postpone to a still more distant future the threatened enactment of an income tax , which has become a party cry , not so much for the purpose of putting money in the national treasury , as for extracting money from the purses of the rich bourgeoisie . THEODORE STANTON . RECENT IMPROVEMENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where the free public library is still unknown , and where its value as an educational factor is not as yet appreciated . During the past few years , however , a new impetus has been given to the movement , so that to-day it may with truth be said that in its new life the free public library is passing through very much the same phases of its existence as did the free public school , which for many years received its sole support from a very small section of the country . The benefit to be derived from a collection of books open to the free use of the public is being more widely appreciated , and its introduction to localities to which it has heretofore been a stranger must necessarily follow . The intelligent teachers of the present day are among the strongest supporters of the free public library , having the opportunities to see the great advantages which the pupils under their charge enjoy in the free use of a library of well-selected books . The very best results in education will be found in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply the needs of the school superintendent in carrying out his desires of instilling in the minds of his pupils that habit of reading which tends to make their studies tenfold more beneficiaL This co8peration between these two men charged with the education of the young results not only in forming a habit of reading , but in teaching a pupil to think and investigate for himself . I am led to write these lines on the free public libraries by reason of the fact that after reading a paper on the subject last summer before an audience composed largely of teachers , I was surrounded by many who. coming from those sections where free public libraries are still institutions of the future , were greatly surprised to learn of the very important part which libraries are playing in educational life elsewhere . Their crude ideas of the use of a public library , as well as the duties of a librarian , find their best expression perhaps in the following extract from an address delivered by the late James Russell Lowell . He pictured to his hearers the inefficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Formerly the duty of a librarian was considered too much that of a watch dog to keep people as much as possible away from the books , and to hand these over to his successor as little worn by use as he could . " Then follows a picture of the enthusiastic and progressive librarian of the present day , in these significant words : " Librarians now , it is pleasant to see , have a different notion of // their trust , and are in the habit of preparing for the direction of the inexperienced lists of such books as they think best worth reading . " Herein lies the secret of very much of the excellent work now being done in our free public libraries . The librarian feels that he is negligent of his trust if he does not do something more than hand out to the inquiring reader such book as he may ask for . He deems it to be part of his duty not only to take the book to the reader , but also to draw the reader to the book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are in his keeping put to good use , resting confident that such reading must of very necessity improve the mind of the reader , and to just that extent prove to be of lasting benefit to him . But it may be asked . What can a librarian do ? What steps can he take to be of service to the reader other than to furnish him with that literature for which he seeks ? The answer to these questions must be " very little , " if it is always left to the reader to take the initiative . If , on the other hand , the librarian studies the tastes of the frequenters of his library , experience in some of our cities at least teaches that the answer must perforce be " much . " As an illustration of one method from the use of which good results are sure to follow , it may be well to mention that work above referred to , namely , a cooperation between the school superintendent and the librarian . As fact is better than fancy , so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our large cities prove of greater interest than would any theory which might be described , The librarian of the city keeps himself continually informed as to the course of study being pursued by the students of the university situated near by . In the reading-room he sets aside a table for their especial use , on which will always be found those books which they may , from time to time , find it profitable to refer to in the course of preparing their themes and essays . A student having , for instance , a thesis to write on some historical subject , knows that he has only to go to the library to find on this special table such books as the librarian has selected as bearing particularly on the subject of his paper . Another work which this same librarian is doing , whose good results are self evident , is to keep informed of those many topics of current news which are daily appearing in the newspapers . Of these he makes a list , which he places on a bulletin board , adding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their catalogue number , which one may well read if he desires to pursue the subject . Let us assume that the librarian , on taking up the morning paper , reads that the United States Government has established a protectorate over the Hawaiian Islands . This item of news he cuts from the paper , places it on the bulletin board , and to it affixes the name of such books as he can recommend to the reader who desires to know more of the Hawaiian Islands , or who wishes to clear up his perhaps too crude ideas of what a protectorate is . How many of us when looking over our daily paper find ourselves but slightly informed on many topics we read about ? To how many of us would not such a librarian as above described prove of great assistance ? It is such work as this which induces the reader to investigate for himself , and it is such a library as this which , being something more than a mere storehouse for books , proves to be a pleasant retreat for the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer does not remember ever having seen in any library any sight // which has given him more pleasure than when , one winter 's morning , talking with the librarian of the above-mentioned library , he watched the visitors come in , both young and old , male as well as female , and , after consulting the bulletin of that day 's news , go at once to the desk and ask for such books as referred to those subjects in which each was particularly interested . This surely is work worth doing , for it trains the reader in that very desirable habit of investigating for himself , and incidentally inculcates a love of reading which is sure to prove a lasting source of happiness and contentment . Such , also , is the kind of codperation which this same librarian has established between himself and the school teachers in his city . He urges these latter to bring the scholars to the library that they may there consult books and pictures having reference to their courses of study . The enthusiasm which such a man brings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to go to , but tends , in a very marked degree , to make the schoolroom happier and its daily task more beneficiaL Of this city it can not justly be said , as was charged by the Hon. Charles Francis Adams in speaking of a certain New England town , " that though the school and the library stand in our main street , side by side , there is , so to speak , no bridge leading from the one to the other . " In the city above referred to there is a steady stream constantly passing between the school and the library , and the good results of such investigation are best shown by the class of books which the pupils in its public schools are using . It is this energy of the modern librarian which has developed the newer life in library management of which mention has been made , and his continued enthusiasm must be depended upon to still further increase the usefulness of which free public libraries are capable . The good service which such a librarian can renderto a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his library is under the charge of a board of trustees who have no true conception of the possibilities for usefulness of the institution under their charge . Too often does it happen that , unmindful of what is being done in other cities , they permit matters to drift along , regarding the ideas advanced by a librarian , such as above described , as foolish and impracticable . The problems of library science are as imj*ortant as those which present themselves to school committees , and a trustee who , either from unwillingness , or from want of time , does not to some extent at least make a study of them , is a detriment to the community , because he is occupying a place which might be filled by some one who would meet the librarian 's zeal with his own enthusiastic interest in the subject . Given a city or town with both a progressive librarian and an enthusiastic and investigating school superintendent , their respective boards being in hearty sympathy with them , and there is practically no limit to the good educational work which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to read , and the library , teaching what to read , will together raise the standard of the literature read in that city , which result must show fruit in the increased happiness and intelligence of its inhabitants . E. C. Hovxy . LABOR POLITICS IN A NEW PLACE . SINCE the Reform Act of 1884 , Labor candidates at parliamentary elections in England have been numerous . There were three Labor members in // 379 the House of Commons in the period which intervened between the reform acts of 1867 and 1884 . The first of these acts enfranchised the working classes in the boroughs ; the second enfranchised those in the rural communities ; but it was not until after the last of the measures of parliamentary reform that Labor candidates came forward in any large numbers at the general elections . They appeared in considerable numbers at the election of 1885 ; a larger number came forward in 1886 , at the election which followed the rejection of the last Home Rule bill ; and in 1892 the number was again greatly increased , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen or seventeen Labor members , representatives of both the old and the new trade-unionism . Until about two years ago , Labor candidates had sought election only to the House of Commons . Within the last two years , however , they have sought seats on the town councils , on the school boards , and on the boards of guardians for the relief of the poor . These are separate and distinct local bodies , elected at different times , but practically on the same franchise , and on a franchise under which all householders , whether men or women , have votes . As is the case with membership of the House of Commons , no pay attaches to membership of any of these local administrative bodies , although service on them entails large calls on the time of members . All the city and town councils in England are fashioned on the same model , that set up by the Municipal Reform Act of 1835 , and in the month of November each year in every municipality in the country , at least onethird of the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1892 followed too closely upon the general election to admit of the success of the Labor candidates in the Parliamentary contests having its full effect upon the new movement in municipal politics ; but the quickening effect of that success was apparent at the elections in the municipalities in November , 1893 . The Labor movement in national politics in 1892 was strongest in the north of England , in the mining constituencies of Lancashire and Yorkshire and of Durham and Northumberland , and it was in these counties that the introduction of Labor politics into municipal affairs was everywhere apparent in the November elections . Nine Labor candidates were put forward in Manchester , five or six in Sallord , several in each of the boroughs of Leeds , Bradford , and Halifax , and , in fact , there was scarcely a large municipality in the industrial districts of the north of England in which one or more Labor candidates did not seek election to the town council . In some places these candidates came out as Socialists , in others as the representatives of the Independent Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed was paid to the old party lines , the representatives of Labor being put forward in opposition to both Liberal and Conservative candidates . Imperial politics have absolutely nothing to do with the duties which Parliament has imposed on town councils . All these bodies are merely administrative , and each is held in check by the Local Government Board in London . Notwithstanding this fact , in many of the English municipalities the members of the councils are elected on party lines ; and these lines are as well drawn at the annual town elections in November as at the Parliamentary elections . At the municipal elections the Liberals have always claimed the support of the working classes . Hitherto they have generally received it , but it now seems to be the policy of the local leaders of the // more aggressive section of the new democracy to nominate candidates of their own class and to put forward demands in behalf of labor in municipal as well as in national politics . As yet these demands have not been embodied in a programme which is accepted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme is not so well defined as is the Newcastle programme of the Radicals , the Fabian programme , or the programme of the Independen* Labor party in national politics . It is , however , gradually defining itself , and the shape the Labor programme will ultimately take may be ascertained with some exactness from a perusal of the speeches which were made in the municipalities at the November elections . From these it is easy to note the points on which the Labor party is disposed to make new departures in municipal government . To begin with , the prevailing idea with the Labor party in municipal politics appears to be that the employers and the moneyed classes have hitherto enjoyed more than their fair share of the management of town affairs . In a measure this is true , for the municipal candidates of both the old political parties have always been drawn exclusively from the middle classes . In order to bring about some equalization , the Labor party is demanding the abolition of the aldermanic bench in the city councils . Aldermen owe their presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords when the Municipal Reform bill was before it in 1835 . The aldermanic principle was introduced with the intention of safeguarding property , and by its working one-fourth of the members of every city council are elected by the council itself , and not by the direct vote of the townspeople . The Radicals long ago objected to the aldermanic principle , but of late they.have ceased to agitate for its abolition , and the campaign which the Radicals began and continued for nearly half a century , has been taken up by the Labor party , which is now seeking so to amend the constitution of all governing bodies that every member shall owe his place to the direct votes of the constituents . The Socialistic Labor party in the municipalities affirms that * it sees in the municipal machinery an important means by which it can work out the industrial emancipation which is at the bottom of its policy . " But the Socialists and the Independent Labor party are in agreement in many of the demands they are making . Both ask for an eight-hours day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages to all workmen engaged on public works . They are also in agreement in the demand that there shall be an end to the contractor and the middleman in work under . taken for or by the municipality . When a new drainage scheme is to be carried out or a bridge rebuilt , the Labor party insist that the work shall be done under the supervision of officers of the municipality and by work . men directly in its pay . They also insist that the same principle shall be adopted in all work paid for out of public money . A large municipality like Manchester or Liverpool , for instance , pays out thousands of pounds every year for the uniforms of its police force , its fire brigade , and its army of inspectors . Under the existing arrangement the city council invites bids from tailors for the furnishing of these uniforms , and usually accepts the lowest of the offers . The Labor party is anxious to put an end to this system of competition for municipal orders , and in its place calls for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union rates of pay and conditions of work shall prevail , and requires that // 381 in these workshops and factories , as in connection with all other public works , the municipality shall set an example to all other employers of labor . The municipalization of the street-car lines is also demanded by the Socialists . In Manchester there was a protest against the extension of the large tenement-block system , and a demand for more self-contained cottages on the outskirts of the city , with the provision of better railroad and street-car facilities for reaching them . A kindred demand was that in every new dwelling-house the town council shall insist that there shall be a bathroom , no matter how small the house or the rental at which it is to be let . Other demands in Manchester and Salford were that gas should be sold at net cost , and that the coke produced at the municipal gasworks should , irrespective of the price of coal , be sold at prices placing it within the means of the poorer classes . In almost every city where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were protests against the salaries paid to the higher municipal officials , and demands for the levelling down of the salaries of the lawyers who hold the office of town clerk , and of the borough engineers and their assistants , and the levelling up of the wages of the unskilled day laborers employed by the municipality . These men receive wages which range from eighteen shillings to one pound a week . These wages areregarded as inadequate by the Labor politicians , who , on the other hand , maintain that the salaries paid the more responsible members of the permanent municipal staff are altogether too high . There are not a score of men , all told , in the service of the English municipalities who receive salaries of a thousand pounds a year ; but the Labor politicians insist that no such salary should be paid , but that ? 250 a year should be the maximum salary for municipal officials , no matter what their qualifications or the responsibilities of the offices . On one or two points there is a remarkable Jack of agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , the Labor leaders , especially those representingthe older trade-unionism.objected to the maintenance of the Labor Bureau which the Town Council established in the winter of 1892 , when the unemployed problem became pressing . Their complaint against the bureau was that it showed the needs of labor and enabled the employers to obtain men for less wages than would otherwise be paid . The same complaint , it may be noted , has been brought against the Labor Gazette , which has been published by the Board of Trade since Mr. Mundella extended the Labor Department at Whitehall . Almost at the same time that the Salford Labor leaders were putting forward their plea against the local labor bureau , the , Labor leaders in Liverpool were urging the city council to follow the lead of Salford and establish a labor bureau , with a view to reducing the number of the unemployed . Only a few of the demands put forward by the Labor party at the municipal elections can possibly be accepted by the town councils to which they were addressed , and to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Largely increased Parliamentary powers will be necessary if many of these demands are to be conceded , and these new powers can only be obtained by a much further development of the Labor and Socialistic movement in national politics . This development , however , will be greatly aided by the organization and activity of the Labor party which were shown in the municipal elections in November . EDWARD Ponnrn* , // THE NORTH AAIERIC'AJA7 REVIEW . THE FINANCIAL DEPENDENCE OF WOMAN . SOCIAL reformers are not slow to point out to women that the key of their position is financial independence ; without it , the most intimate relationships rest on an insecure foundation . It is a matter of common observation that the married woman with means of her own has more chance of consideration than the dowerless woman ; other things being equal , her opinion , her entity are more valuable when enhanced by a settled income of her own , even if it be small . The Women 's Progressive Society has for its fifth object : " To educate public opinion on the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an aim is strictly in accord with the socialistic tendencies of our day , and much , indeed almost everything , can be said in its favor . Women are grasping the conditions which surround them ; they perceive that , ' though certain men , imbued more or less with the chivalrous spirit , may grant a substantial equality to the women dependent on them , it is for them a much safer position to stand by their own exertions on the basis of equality . In the former case , women depend on what lies outside self ; in the latter , on self alone . In certain circumstances the difference is practically non-existent ; in others , it may be infinite . At a recent meeting of progressive women , one of the speakers gave forth no uncertain sound on this subject . She stated that the financial independence of her sex is strictly necessary to happiness in marriage ; that without it the married woman is little better than a slave ; in one word , it is the degradation of woman . And this speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large proportion were self-supporting women . Now it may be granted that the ideal position for every able-bo4ied man or woman is a self-supporting one ; the undoubtedly socialistic tendency of our age will develop this ideal . Every individual will more and more render service to society in return for benefits received ; the elimination of parasites , of the vast army of do-nothings , is a foregone conclusion . Itmay be predicted with absolute certainty that the English legislature , when its constitution has become more democratic , and hereditary legislators have disappeared , will deal with the probate duty on vast fortunes , and with the land question , in a manner in which it has never dealt with them before . As yet , we have hardly touched the fringe of these difficulties . But whilst admitting that individual independence is an ideal worth working towards , it will not be attained any sooner by progressive women representing the financial dependence of a wife as degradation . It is conceivable that if any considerable'nuinber of independent women acted on suco an assumption , they might*positively retard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the financial independence of woman would in the main be a solid guarantee of her happiness in the marriage relation . It has been repeatedly pointed out by the intelligent foreigner , especially , perhaps , the Frenchman , that an Englishwoman begins marriage badly who is made over to her husband without a dot-a factor of such importance in France that , with exceptions , a woman is hardly considered marriageable unless she is provided for to some extent . The thriftlessness of English parents , their birdlike irresponsibility to their children-possibly an outcome of the rapid growth of England 's empire-is bound to yield in this particular ; changed conditions , the insight and // writings of men and women like Mr. Walter Besant , * Mrs. Annie Besant , and Charles Bradlaugh , will surely help to raise a standard for parents who have no moral right , either for the sake of a daughter or her husband , to send her dowerless to that husband . The recognition that respectable provision for his daughters is a father 's duty will equally certainly tend to limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even half a dozen unprovided daughters will , ere many years have passed , be reprobated as instances of gross injustice and unpardonable self-indulgence . But in the mean time little is to be gained by representing the financial dependence of a married woman on her husband as a species of degradation . If any considerable number of capable women , honorably supporting themselves , were to decline marriage because it entailed their withdrawal from self - supporting employment , and consequent financial dependence on their husbands , the cause of advanced womanhood could not but receive a check , if there be any truth underlying the doctrine of heredity . From the point of view of " forward light brigade , " their ranks must be recruited again and again in the coming generation by women who object to this financial dependence . To leave marriage tothe twining-ivy woman , to her who will accept marriage at any price and without any terms , is a policy inimical to the social enfranchisement of women . The children of the capable woman who even for a time has maintained her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more likely to forward the cause of woman than the children of the dependent woman . Like many another movement , this one demands self-sacrifice from its adherents . It may suit its enemies to advise men to marry women who have had no practical knowledge of the struggle of life , and no share in it ; it can never suit enlightened women to advocate such a policy . It will probably be long before the average Englishman recognizes what the higher morality requires of him in assuring , so far as his conduct and effort c. *in assure it , the position of his children . Indeed , up to the present one may almost say that he wilfully declines to see that there is any moral compulsion laid upon him to limit their numbers . The late Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant , when they frankly advocated this policy , were treated as disseminators of a shameful immorality , and sentenced by an English law court to fine and imprisonment . Dr. Pearson points out , in his remarkable work , National Life and Character , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine new opinions , and to accept and teach them . Ours is another age ; and though we have astonishing proof that the latter part of our century is ca ' 4ing off sluggish indifference to the wellbeing of the community , yet it would only be wise in progressive women to remember that in nothing do men yield more slowly than to the need of modifying their relations to women . If any proof be needed , the shameful divorce laws , which found their origin in a barbaric age , are still the law of the land ; quite recently the House of Coni. mons declined to remodel them in accordance with the growing spirit of justice , a reform demanded by a considerable number of Its members . It is hardly necessary to point out that the financial dependence of a married woman on her husband does not necessarily imply degradation . On the contrary , if women are capable administrators , if they can spend money wisely and save it reasonably , their value is as rubies . The writer is acquainted with women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Endowment of the Daughter , " In Lomgiman 's Mat , azin* , April , 1888. // their talent lay , stipulated for the command of the purse . And it is just here where some experience of the value of money , its purchasing power , its painful inelasticity , is of the first importance . It is , on the whole , a much better thing for a woman to spend wisely her husband 's income of say ? 400 than for her to give a divided mind to the administration of their home and continue work of her own by which that Income is supplemented by , let us say , ? 130 . It is true that men themselves do not always see this ; at least not to the extent of givirrg a wife the command of the purse , or of settling a fair annual sum upon her as the price of entirely devoting her services to the wise management of the home . The sensible woman , she who is not just fresh from the schoolroom and entirely absorbed by the sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement for her comfort and reasonable independence in her husband 's home before she crosses the threshold as his wife . Wives who have failed to make such an arrangement , who have not fore . seen that a husband 's disposition displays far more human nature than a lover 's , need not necessarily be " degraded " by financial dependence . Even in this case they may , and as a matter of fact often do , assume the direction of the household and obtain due respect and consideration . It is absurd to expect that character and capacity will not carry weight in the marriage relation as in every other . Nor is it going too far to say that , where a m*irried woman has to ask her husband , after a few years of marriage , for every sovereign she has to spend on her clothes , she is deficient in these respects . Few men fighting the battle of life would choose of their own free will to both earn and spend their income ; where they do so , it is usually a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of her failure to administer . Man is not so fond of double work as some would have us believe . The writer was intimately acquainted with a penniless lady who , at the age of exactly nineteen , married a man ten years older than herself . When they began life she received a weekly sum for household expenses , had to usk for every penny for her own clothing , and to ask it as a favor . But midway in a long married life she assumed the expenditure of her husband 's income , because experience can not justify the exclusion of a capable person from the direction of affairs , even when the age and inclination of the husband favor his assuming it . The recognition of the fact that character and capacity are necessary in matrimony , that their absence is fatal to anything like a substantial equality of the sexes in every relation of life , will save us from much idle vaporing . Sex is a disqualification for much that is desirable in life ; character and capacity never are . That many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they enjoy despite their sex ; their absence explains far more in " the tyrant man " theory than perhaps progressive women are will . ing to allow . If the vanguard of the woman movement could contrive some system by which women of character and capacity should take precedence in their sex as candidates for matrimony , they might render a real service to " the cause . " one of far more practical value than the mere statement that financial dependence is degrading.
