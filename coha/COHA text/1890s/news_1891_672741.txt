The firms of Gov . Francis and Councilman M. T. Anderson did much to reassure the frightened ones at the outset this morning . " Sid " Francis gathered a number of those on the floor around him and announced that his firm would do no trading , except to close deals . Councilman Anderson followed this example . and the strain was felt to be relaxing all around .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction that had been put on speculation . " It is the best thing that could have been done . " Henry Haarstiek said . " If it had not been done , " said S. B. M. Keh " there would have been trouble on the floor to-day . " Chicago seemed to think the St. Louis plan was a poor one to prevent failures , and the traders over there telegraphed hero that they were doing nothing , except in the Southwest , and did n't care for any fresh news . - But in spite of the attempt to hold down the safety valve the excitement began again as soon as the morning call was opened . and the messenger boys began to rush about among the crowd with the telegrams from the rattling instruments . Wheat , which had closed Saturday at ** and had sold on the curb at $1.09 , opened at $1.08 , went up to $L12 , and then down as low as $1.05 , fluctuating in the most erractie way between these two points .
