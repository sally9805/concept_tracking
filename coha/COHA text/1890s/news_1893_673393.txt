txt To throw a boomerang efficiently so that it will sail off through the sky , wheel high in air , poise , flutter down in graceful sweeps , and rise again in at least one more circling course before gradually sailing its ellipse and falling almost at the feet of the man who throws it  --  to do this , so Mr. Frost says , one must be a cannibal . That is , nobody but an Australian cannibal has ever been able to do the trick , in spite of the claims of certain white men who have lived in the bush among the black men that they have learned it . Mr. Frost is the manager of a band of Australian blacks , four men and a woman , whom he has been exhibiting in this country and is about to take back to Europe , where they have given their shows previously . They will not exhibit publicly in New-York this Autumn because it is so cold that their manager is afraid his wards will become ill and die , and a dead cannibal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave an exhibition of their peculiar prowess yesterday afternoon on the Polo Grounds , although the earth and turf were soaked full of water , and the chances are good that all the cannibals will have sore throats to-day . Doubtless the manager does not intend to be unkind , but he uses hard words in describing his show . He says : " This is the only band of these ferocious , treacherous , uncivilized savages , with deep scars and seams in their tortured flesh , and with bones thrust through their noses as ornaments , that has ever been seen in America . It is worth journeying a hundred miles to see these specimens of the lowest order of man . " They look like the common , or garden , " coons " of upper Sixth Avenue , except for their hair . This does not kink , but is long and stiff , yet silky . Four men and one woman appeared on the ground . They all wore full suits of heavy black worsted tights , and about the loins and over the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair on , and ornamented with capes and fringes of what looked like squirrels ' tails . Mr. Frost explained that under the tights each wore two suits of the heaviest underclothing to be procured , and that , even so clad , they were cold . Their costume in Australia consists of no clothes at all . The name of the woman is Fagara , and one of the men is called Dilaroo . The names of the other men are unpronounceable sequences of liquid syllables . The woman was said to be twenty-three years old . She was hideously ugly and wrinkled and appeared to be more than 100 . It is said the women never live to be more than forty-five years old . The most noticeable thing about the physique of the whole lot was the extreme slenderness of their arms and legs . They are not strong , but wiry . For nearly an hour the four men threw their boomerangs , and these incomprehensible weapons spun away in long curves , wheeled , returned , and mounted again in the circling flight of birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown . The queer bent sticks seemed to increase In velocity the longer they remained in the air , and they whizzed like pinwheels in the last wonderful upward flight before they fell to the ground . The boomerangs thrown yesterday were made of hickory , and were about eighteen inches or two feet long , bent in the peculiar curve which no white man has ever been able to duplicate . The sticks were all carved out by the blacks , and scraped smooth . The edges were sharp . Yankee carpenters have tried repeatedly to whittle out practicable boomerangs , but each time the black has taken it and said : " No good . No come back . " For they have picked up a few words of English in the eighteen months of their travels as a show , and the bitterness of it seems to be that they find most things Caucasian to come under the same laconic comment . After they had exhibited their skill as long as the persons wading around in the mud appeared to enjoy it , the five were called up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lecture , enlarging upon their bloodthirsty habit of eating human flesh . " Nobody but these cannibals ever throws the boomerang successfully , " he said . " It is the natural weapon of the Australian blackfellow . It is said to have been suggested to a fat old cannibal King ages ago as he was lying under a banana tree by seeing one of the leaves of the tree fall , sail away , and return to the bottom of the trunk . These boomerangs are shaped just like the leaf of that most wonderful tree . " While the blacks were standing in a row several young men from the College of Physicians and Surgeons who had been practicing football came and watched them . Among them was one young man who was a literal mountain of flesh . His fat was prodigious . As he hove in sight one of the cannibals nudged his comrade and said something to him . Then both of them gazed longingly upon the physical expanse of the football player , and one of them clicked his teeth together . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a " peace corroboree , " when they all sang a queer , monotonous chant whose words were a gurgle of quickfalling syllables , striking their boomerangs together to accent the time . Then came the " war corroboree , " in which the men sang louder and let their eyes roll fiercely , ending by jumping forward and swaying their bodies to and fro as if on the track of an enemy , peering right and left ant/ gnashing their teeth . The dance ended with a general clashing of boomerangs and a subdued howl from the lady cannibal .
