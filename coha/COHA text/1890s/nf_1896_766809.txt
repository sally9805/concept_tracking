The accompanying paper is one of the results of personal investigations among the Omaha of Nebraska and cognate tribes of Indians , beginning in 1878 and continued from time to time during late years . While the paper treats of the Omaha tribe , much that is said is applicable to the Ponka , as the two tribes have long had similar environments and a common dialect , for , until 1877 , their habitats were almost contiguous , and since 1880 about one-third of the Ponka tribe has been dwelling on its former reservation near the town of Niobrara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many valuable suggestions early in the progress of the work . DWELLINGS . The primitive domiciles of the Omaha were chiefly ( 1 ) lodges of earth or , more rarely , of bark or mats , and ( 2 ) skin lodges or tents . It may be observed that there were no sacred rites connected with the earth lodge-building or tent-making among the Omaha and Ponka . Earth Lodges . When earth lodges were built , the people did not make them in a tribal circle , each man erecting his lodge where he wished ; yet kindred commonly built near one another . The earth lodges were made by the women , and were intended principally for summer use , when the people were not migrating or going on the hunt . Those built by the Omaha and Ponka were constructed in the following manner : The roof was supported by two series of vertical posts , forked at the top for the reception of the transverse connecting pieces of each series . The number in each series varied according to the size of the lodge ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner series , for an ordinary lodge eight were required , and ten generally constituted the maximum . When Mr. Say1 visited the Kansa Indians , he occupied a lodge in which twelve of these posts placed in a circle formed the outer series , and eight longer ones constituted the inner series , also describing a circle . The wall was formed by setting upright slabs of wood back of the outer posts all around the circumference of the lodge . These slabs were not over 6 feet in height , and their tops met the cross timbers on which the willow posts rested . Stocks of hard willow about 2 inches in diameter rested with their butts on the tops of the upright slabs and extended on the cross timbers nearly to the summit . These poles were very numerous , touching one another and extending all around in a radiating manner , supporting the roof like rafters . The rafters were covered with grass about a foot thick ; and over the whole lodge , including the sides or slabs , earth was piled from a foot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty years . A hole in the middle served as an exit for the smoke . Footnote 1 : James ' account of Long 's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in 1819- ' 20 . Illustration : Fig. 306.  --  Yellow Smoke 's earth lodge . In addition to the lodge proper there was a covered way about 10 feet long and 5 feet wide , the entrance to which had a covering of tanned or dried buffalo hides . This covering consisted of two hides hanging side by side , with the inner borders slightly overlapping . They were fastened to the passageway at the top and at the outer sides , but were loose at the bottom where they overlapped . This part was raised by a person entering the lodge . A similar covering was placed at the interior end of the passageway . Subsequently to 1855 , the Omaha dwelt in three villages composed of earth lodges , as follows : ( 1 ) Biku ' de , a village near the agency ; ( 2 ) Windja ' ge , Standing Hawk 's village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janca ' te ( " Wood Eaters , " ) named after an insect found under the bark of trees Sanssouci 's village , near the town of Decatur , Nebraska . Earth lodges were generally used for large gatherings , such as feasts , councils , or dances . Occasionally there was a depression in the center of the lodge which was used as a fireplace ; but it was not over 6 inches deep . Each earth lodge had a ladder , made by cutting a series of deep notches along one side of a log . On a bluff near the Omaha agency I found the remains of several ancient earth lodges , with entrances on the southern sides . Two of these were 75 feet and one was 100 feet in diameter . In the center of the largest there was a hollow about 3 feet deep and nearly 4 feet below the surface outside the lodge . Lodges of Bark or Mats . The Omaha sometimes make bark lodges for summer occupancy , as did the Iowa and Sak . Tiu ' cipu jin ' ga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Omaha in former days . Such lodges are still common among the Winnebago , the Osage , and other tribes . The ground plan of such a lodge forms an ellipse . The height is hardly over 7 feet from the ground . The tent poles are arranged thus : Each pole has one end planted in the ground , the other end being bent down and fastened to the pole immediately opposite ; a number of poles thus arranged in pairs formed both wall posts and rafters . Illustration : Fig. 307.  --  Ground plan of Osage lodge . Generally there was one fireplace and one smokehole in such a lodge ; but when I visited the Osage in 1883 , I entered a low lodge with two fireplaces , each equidistant from its end of the lodge and the entrance , each fireplace having its smokehole . Skin Lodges or Tents . The tent was used when the people were migrating , and also when they were traveling in search of the buffalo . It was also the favorite abode of a household during the winter season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed situation , selected on account of comfort in the summer . The tent could be pitched in the timber or brush , or down in wooded ravines , where the cold winds never had full sweep . Hence , many Indians abandoned their houses in winter and went into their tents , even when they were of canvas . Illustration : Fig. 308.  --  Omaha tent ( from a photograph by W. H. Jackson ) . The tent was commonly made of ten or a dozen dressed or tanned buffalo skins . It was in the shape of a sugar loaf , and was from 10 to 12 feet high , 10 or 15 feet in diameter at the bottom , and about a foot and a half in diameter at the top , which served as a smokehole ( tihukan ) . Besides the interior tent poles ( tici  --  3 , figure 309 ) and the tent skin ( tiha  --  1 ) , the tent had the ticumanhan , or the place where the skins were fastened together above the entrance ( 4 ) . The ticumanhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pieces of hide thrust crosswise through the holes in the tent skins . The bottom of the tent was secured to the ground by pins ( tihucugadan  --  6 ) driven through holes ( tihugaqcuge ) in the bottom of the skins , made when the latter were tanned and before they had become hard . The entrance ( tijebe ) was generally opposite the quarter from which the wind was blowing . A door flap ( tijebegcan  --  7 ) hung over the entrance ; it was made of skin with the hair outside , so as to turn water , and was held taut by a stick fastened to it transversely . The bottom of the door flap was loose , but the top was fastened to the tent . Illustration : Fig. 309  --  Exterior parts of an Omaha tent . The smokehole was formed by the two tihugabcinca(9) , or triangular ends of tent skins , immediately above the entrance and ticumanhan . When there was no wind both of the tihugabcinca were kept open by means of the tihucubajin(8) or exterior tent poles , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corners of the tihugabcinca . When the wind blew one of the tihucubajin was raised to the windward and the other was lowered , pulling its skin close to the tent and leaving an opening for the escape of the smoke ; but if the wind came directly against the entrance both the flaps were raised , closing the smokehole to prevent the wind from blowing down it . When the wind blew the people used nandicagaspe to keep the bottom of each tent skin in place . These consisted of twisted grass , sticks , stones , or other heavy objects . Figure 310 represents the tent of Pejequde , an Omaha . The banners or standards , which were carried by the leaders of a war party or a party going on a dancing tour , are depicted with their decorations of strips of red and blue Indian cloth . Sometimes these standards were ornamented with feathers instead of with cloth . Each standard could be used in four war expeditions . No totem posts were in use among the Omaha . The tent of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gentile badge , which was painted on each side of the entrance as well as on the back of the tent. 1 The furniture of the sacred tents resembled that of the ordinary ones . Before the introduction of canvas tents by the whites no needles or thread were used by the Siouan tribes . The women used sinew of the deer or buffalo instead of thread , and for needles they had awls made of elk horn . Illustration : Fig. 310.  --  Pejequde 's tent . Since there were no outbuildings , public granaries , or other structures of this description , each household stored away its own grain and other provisions . There were no special tribal or communal dwellings ; but sometimes two or more households occupied a single earth lodge . When a council was held , it took place in the earth lodge of one of the head chiefs , or else two or three common tents were united , making one large one. 2 There were no public baths , as the Missouri river was near , and they could resort to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth lodges or skin tents . Sweat-lodges were in the form of low tents ( tiucipu ) . 3 Stones were not boiled for the sweat-lodge , but were put into the fire to be heated . They were removed from the fire by means of sticks called in , ) ebasican , and then water from the kettle was poured on them , creating steam . Cedar fronds were dropped on the stones , causing a perfume to arise . Footnote 1 : Third Ann . Rep. Bur . Ethnology for 1882- ' 83 , p. 230 ; also " A Study of Siouan Cults , " in Eleventh Ann .

FURNITURE AND IMPLEMENTS . Fireplaces . Within the tent , in the center , was the fireplace ( unec ) e ) , formed by excavating a small hollow . Beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , on which was hung the apparatus for suspending a kettle over the fire . This apparatus was called cexe ucugacke by the Ponka , literally , " that by means of which the kettle is hung . " The Omaha have two names for it , uhan ucugacke , and ucugackegce , the last syllable of the latter name referring to the attitude of the post . Around the fireplace was a circular space for the feet of the people as they sat about the fire . The couches of the occupants of the tent were arranged outside of and all around this circular space . Beds and Bedding . A couch was formed by laying down two or three winter hides dried with the hair on . These hides were placed around the fireplace at a safe distance . In the earth lodges , according to Joseph La Fleche , the Omaha used sahi , or grass mats , for seats , as is the present custom of the Winnebago ; but at night they reclined on dressed hides with thick hair on them , and covered themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inbehin . When the vegetation was about 3 inches high in the spring , the Indians killed deer and pulled off the hair in order to remove the thin skin or tissue next to it . This latter , when thoroughly dried , is smooth and white , resembling parchment . It was used for pillows and moccasin-strings . When used for pillows the case was filled with goose feathers or the hair of the deer until it was about 2 feet long and 9 inches high . During the day , and whenever there was occasion , they were used as seats ; but if none could be had , the people sat on winter robes or hides forming the couches. 1 Back of the couches and next to the interior tent-poles were placed the baggage , sacks of corn , and other household properties . The upright tent is one form of the Dakota " wake ' ya , " the plural of which , " wake ' yapi , " undoubtedly gave rise to the familiar " wick ' iup " of the plains , and also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A board of convenient size , usually about a yard long and a foot wide , was selected to form a cradle or ucuhe . No pillow was needed . A soft skin ( paqcuqaha can ) covered with plenty of thick hair was laid on the board , and on it was placed the infant . Footnote 1 : Hammocks and bedsteads were unknown prior to their introduction by the traders and other white people . Footnote 2 : Contributions to North American Ethnology , vol. iv. , 1881 , p. 114 . Illustration : Fig. 311.  --  Omaha cradle  --  plan . In the annexed figures , a is the ) induacisinkanhe , the object painted on the board at the end where the infant 's head is laid ; b is the ) indeicid ) indin ( " that which is drawn taut over the face " ) , the two strings of beads and sinew or thread ( sometimes made of red calico alone ) , which keep in place the fan , etc. ; the fan ( ) indeagani ) , which is suspended from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches square , and is now made of interwoven sinew on which beads have been strung . Occasionally thimbles and other bright objects dangle from the bottom of the fan . The icacistage ( d ) is the band by which the infant is fastened to the cradle . Illustration : Fig. 312.  --  Omaha cradle  --  side view . Children 's Swings . For swings the ends of two withes of buffalo hide were secured to four trees or posts which formed the corners of a parallelogram . A blanket was thrown across the withes and folded over on them . The infant was laid on top of the fold and swung from side to side without falling . Brooms . Brooms were of two kinds . One form was made of sticks tied together , and was used for sweeping the ground outside of the tent or earth lodge , and the interior of the earth lodge , except the fireplace . The other kind was made of goose or turkey feathers , and was used for sweeping the fireplace of an earth lodge . Pottery . Pottery has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The art of making it has been forgotten by the tribe . Mortar and Pestles . A mortar was made by burning a large hole in a round knot or piece of wood about 7 inches in diameter . The lower end was sharpened to a point , which was thrust into the ground when needed for use . After putting corn in a mortar of this description , the woman grasped the wooden pestle in the middle , with the larger end upward ; the smaller end , which was about an inch in diameter , was put into the mortar . The operation of pounding corn among the Omaha was called " he . " The mortar ( uhe ) and pestle ( wehe ) were both made commonly of elm , although sometimes they were fashioned of white oak . Mortars were of various sizes , some of them measuring 2 feet in diameter . Pestles were always of hard and heavy wood , and fully 3 feet long , taperring from 4 inches to an inch in diameter . Illustration : Fig. 314.  --  Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spoons , Ladles and Drinking Vessels . Spoons were made of horn , wood , or pottery . The black spoons made of buffalo horn ( tehe sab ) e ) , are not used by such Omaha as belong to the Buffalo gentes ( Inkesab ) e , Catada , Tesinde , etc. ) which may not touch a buffalo head . Other horn spoons of light color are made of cow horn . These are of modern origin . Wooden spoons ( jantehe ) were made of knobs or knots of trees . Spoons made of buffalo horn are found among the Omaha and Ponka , but the Osage , Kansa , and Kwapa use clam shells ( tihaba , in Cegiha ; tcuehaba , tcuehuba , in Kansa ) , so the Kansa call a small spoon , tcuehaba jinga . Spoons of buffalo horn had their handles variously ornamented by notches and other rude carving , often terminating in the head of a bird , the neck or handle of each being elevated at an angle of 50 deg. or 60 deg. with the bowl , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in length . As the handle of such a spoon usually terminates in a head or hook , it was impossible for it to slip into the bowl when the hook rested on the outside of the rim of the bowl . Food was served in bowls of a very wide and simple form and of various sizes , generally carved out of large knots of wood . These served as drinking cups ( ni ' icatan ) , but now cups of tin or earthenware are used for that purpose . Water Vessels When pottery was made , they used bowls and kettles . Some used wooden bowls of different sizes , the largest being about 2 feet in diameter . When they went on the hunt , they used the inijeha ( or sack made of the muscular coating of the buffalo paunch , by filling with , grass to make it stand out and keep its shape until dried ) . When the inijeha was filled with water the mouth was tied , and it was kept covered and in the shade that it might remain cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelling , and was thrown away , another taking its place . Some preferred the " ten ) an ' de uqca ' ha can " or pericardium ( ? ) of the buffalo , which is like sinew . This does not smell unpleasant , even when used for seven or ten days . But at the expiration of that time it is unfit for further service . Jugs have been introduced by the traders . Other Vessels . Provision sacks or parfleche cases were made of dried buffalo hide . When used for carrying the dried meat , they were called weabasta . After two or three years ' use they became soft and were fit only for making moccasin soles . These sacks had the hair taken off , and were sometimes made in trunk fashion . Fruit baskets were of three kinds . The Ponka made them of the bark of a tree , called tawa , anhe , which is found on the old Ponka reservation in Dakota . Northern Indians make boats of this bark . The Omaha do not find the tree on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of bark . The three kinds of baskets are as follows : Nan ' pa ucis ) e , used for chokecherries ; agcan ' kamange ucis ) e , used for raspberries ; and bact ucis ) e , used for strawberries . When the Ponka wished to make the baskets , they stripped off the bark in horizontal sections , not pulling upward or downward . In modern times the Omaha have learned to make sacks of thread of different colors drawn from black , red , blue , and white blankets . Different figures are woven . Each sack is about a foot deep , 16 inches from the mouth to the opposite side , and from 2 to 2-1/2 feet long . The opening is on one of the long sides , and when the articles are put in a gathering string is drawn and tied . Hoes and Axes . For hoes , the Omaha used the shoulder blades of the buffalo . Axes and hatchets are now made of iron , hence , the Omaha name , man ' ze-pe , sharp iron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi-spe , answering to the Dakota , wanhin ' - kpe , sharp flint . The hatchet is distinguished from the ax by adding " jinga , " small . Some of the stone axes and hatchets have been found on the Omaha reservation , but they could hardly have been used for cutting . It is not known what tools were used for felling trees . Knives . Knives were made of stone . A prominent butte , near the old Ponka agency , Nebraska , is known as " Mahin-tu , " signifying blue knife , from the character of the stone with which its surface is covered . It is several miles from the mouth of Ponka creek and nearly opposite the month of Choteau creek , South Dakota . Implements Connected with Fire . In former ages , the Cegiha made fire by rubbing or turning a stick round and round between the hands . On the present Omaha reservation , and in that region , the Omaha use elm roots for that purpose . In the country called Pizabahehe , near the source of Elkhorn river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has about a hundred fine shoots from each root , which is half the size of the head . The stalk was used for hand drills and fire sticks . One stalk was cut almost flat , and the man puts his feet on the ends to steady them . Then , holding the other stick in his hands , with one end touching the stalk on the ground , he turned it round and round till the friction produced fire . Sometimes a small quantity of dry sand was placed on the flat stick . The same flat stick answered for several occasions . When the cavity made by turning the hand drill became too large , the point of contact was shifted to another part of the flat stick , and so on until the whole of that stick was used , when it was thrown away and another was obtained . Duaduahi , according to Mr. Francis La Flesche , may be found in Judiciary square , Washington , District of Columbia . After the coming of the white man , but before the introduction of friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Omaha used flints and tinder for making fire . Spits for roasting , etc. , naqpe , or webasnan , were made of any kind of wood . For tongs they used the pedicacisande ( " fire-holder " ) , made by slitting one end of a stick . This implement was also called , jan jinga nini ibista ( " the stick that presses the fire against the tobacco " ) , because it was used for lighting pipes . Smoking Paraphernalia . Illustration : Fig. 315.  --  Omaha calumet The pipes in use among the Omaha are of three kinds : the sacred pipe ( niniba waqube , mysterious pipe ) , including the war pipes and those used by the chiefs in making peace ; the niniba weawan or calumet ( illustrated in figure 315 ) , used in the calumet dance or dance of adoption , 1 and the hatchet pipe or manzepe niniba , introduced since the coming of the white man . One form of the pipe used on ordinary Tobacco pouches ( niniujiha ) were made of deer or antelope skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deerskin . Sometimes buffalo bladders were used for this purpose . The women used them as receptacles for their porcupine quills . Footnote 1 : See " Omaha Sociology , " Third Ann . Rept . Bur . Ethnology , chap . vi. occasions is shown in figure 316 . This pipe has a bowl of catlinite , and the stem is decorated with horsehair . Illustration : Fig. 316.  --  Omaha pipe used on ordinary occasions . Equipage for Horses . Saddles ( canakagce ) were in use before the coming of the whites . They were made of wood , around which was wrapped hide , while still " taha-nuka " ( green or soft ) . According to Joseph La Fleche these saddles did not rub sores on the backs of the native horses ( Indian ponies ) , but Dougherty1 said , in 1819 , " The Indians are generally cruel horse-masters , perhaps in a great measure through necessity ; the backs of their horses are very often sore and ulcerated , from the friction of the rude saddle , which is fashioned after the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resting on skin saddle cloths without padding . " They ride very well , and make frequent use of the whip and their heels , the latter being employed instead of spurs . For bridles and halters they used strips of hide , out of which material they made also lariats . The bridle used consisted of a withe , one end of which was wrapped two or three times around the animal 's lower jaw , while the other was held in the hand , forming but a single rein . This did not hinder the rider from guiding his horse , as he was able to turn him to the left by pressing the single rein against the animal 's neck , as well as by the use of the right heel against its side . When he wished to turn to the right , he pulled the rein and pressed his left heel against the horse 's side . Whips were of three kinds . The wahi wegasapi was attached to a bone handle . The handle of a jau ' ukecin wegasapi was made of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osage orange wood , which is very hard . The whip was attached to the wrist by a broad band , which passed through a hole near the end of the handle . The handle was about 15 inches long and was very stout . A specimen that has been deposited in the National Museum ( a gift to the author from an Omaha ) has a lash 2 feet long , composed of 8 thongs one-fifth of an inch wide . These are plaited together in one rounded plait for 18 inches , the rest of the lash being in 2 plaits of 4 thongs each , knotted near the ends . The lasso was called man ' tanah-icize , i.e. , " that by which ( a ) wild ( horse ) is taken . " It was made by taking the hair from the head of a buffalo and plaiting it into a very strong rope as thick as one 's thumb . This rope was called " taha-cisan , " and was utilized by the Omaha and Ponka instead of the common lasso for catching wild horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed into a noose large enough to slip over a horse 's head , and the ends of this noose were secured to a long pole by small cords . The other end of the rope , arranged in a coil , was fastened to the belt or waist of the man . He rode with the pole held in one hand and tried to thrust the noose in front of a horse . When he succeeded in passing the noose over the head of an animal , he threw away the stick , which had become separated from the noose , and held the rope alone , which he pulled toward him . When the horse was caught , the man made an ) inducicin. ( bridle or face cover ) , being careful to place some buffalo hair over the nose and under the chin , to guard against paining the horse , whose eyes remained uncovered . Footnote 1 : Long , S.

Traveling Gear . Snow-shoes ( se-hinbe ) were worn by the Omaha and Ponka when they traversed a region , north of their modern , habitat . For traveling on foot a staff ( hi-mangce ) was used when it was necessary to pass over mountains ; also when , heavy loads had to be carried . This staff differed from the crutch ( i-mangce ) . The women had macakan , or straps , for aiding them in carrying loads of wood , etc . Boats . When they wished to cross streams they made hide boats , or mandeha . These were manufactured from dried buffalo hides , which were sewed together with sinew , and so tightly that no water could penetrate the seams . Ten branches of red willow were placed within , the ends being bent upward and fastened by withes to two other saplings , which extended the whole length of the boat at the inside of the gunwale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or steering oar ( icisan ' c ) e ) was fashioned like the oars ( manducugahi ) , with the blade flat and of the breadth of two hands . The rowers ( ucugahi aka ) sat near the bow , and the steersman ( cisan ' ca aka ) took his seat at the stern . Musical Instruments . Battles were of five kinds , Pexe were generally gourds ; watan ' pexe , gourd rattles , were always round , and were partially filled with seed , fine shot , or gravel , Tahanuka pexe , green-hide rattles , were of two sorts , one of which is " ciguje , " bent a little . Specimens of this form are in the National Museum . Two kinds of rattles were called ta-cage , i.e. , " deers-claws , " from the composition of one variety , though the other was made of molars of the elk . Illustration : Fig. 317  --  Skin drum . Illustration : Fig. 318  --  Box drum . The Omaha used three styles of drums . The cexe-gaku bcaska , or flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the National Museum . The cexe-gaku gadaje is made of buffalo hide , cowhide , or the skin of a horse . An example of this drum ( no. 24682 ) is also in the National Museum , and is illustrated by the accompanying figure 317 . The jan ' cexe-gaku , or kuge cexe-gaku , is a wooden or box drum , represented by the accompanying figure 318 , also from a specimen ( no. 58610 ) in the National Museum . Whistles were made of elder ( batuci-hi , or popgun wood ) by pushing out the pith . No holes were made in the sides of the tube . Nisude tan ' ga , or large flutes , were made of red cedar . A branch was cut off , rounded , split open with a knife , and hollowed out ; then six holes were made in the side of one of them , and the halves were stuck together again . When one of these instruments is blown it produces quavering notes . The best specimens were made by Pacin-tan ' ga , Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Wahi nisude , or bone flutes , were made of the long bones from the eagle wing . These small flutes have only one hole . Reed flutes , ciqce nisude , were made of a kind of reed which grows south of the Omaha territory , probably in Kansas . The Omaha obtained the reeds from some of the southern tribes and made them into flutes having but one hole each .

Illustration : Fig. 320.  --  Omaha club ( jan-pacna ) . The jan-wetin , " striking-wood , " is a four-sided club . It is made of ash , and is as long as from the elbow to the tips of the fingers . The jan-daona , " wood with a smooth head , " is a club made of ironwood , which is very hard . According to the late Joseph La Fleche , the Omaha form of this weapon had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 321.  --  Omaha club ( jan-dacna ) . Illustration : Fig. 322.  --  Omaha club ( weaqcade ) . Figures 320 and 321 are forms of the jan-pacna which may be seen in the National Museum ( nos. 2649 and 22419 ) . The weaqcade , another kind of war club , is made of some kind of hard wood . There are two varieties , one of which is shown in figure 322 ( National Museum no. 23729 ) . The other has a ball carved at the end of a straight handle , with a wooden point ( of one piece with the ball and handle ) projecting from the ball , making an angle of about 130 deg. with one side of the handle . There is a steel point inserted in the ball , forming an angle of about 110 deg. with the other side of the handle . The in ' - wate- jin ' ga is something like a slung shot . A round stone is wrapped in a piece of hide which is fastened to a wooden handle about 2 feet long . Tomahawks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first made of stone ; but within the last century and a half they have been fashioned of iron . Spears . Lances , darts , or spears are designated by the general term man ' d ) ehi . The jan ' - man 'd ) ehi are made of ash , and are from 6 to 8 feet long . There are two kinds , of one of which the handle is round , and about an inch in diameter , and the point is flat and about the width of three fingers at its juncture with the handle . Besides these there are the lances , called waqcexe-caze , of which there are two varieties . One consists of a straight pole , which has been thrust through a piece of buffalo hide that has its long end sewed together , forming a sort of covering . To this hide are fastened feathers of the crow and min ' xa-san , or swan , in alternate rows or bunches . Between the feathers are fastened square pieces of blanket . About the middle of the pole a space of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the place where the spear is grasped . When the pole was not set into a metal point the lower end was cut very sharp. 1 The other variety , or mand ) ehi ciguje , " bent spear , " is the weapon which the Dakota call " wahukeza . " It is ornamented with eagle feathers placed at intevals , one being at the end of the curved part ; and it generally terminates at the bottom in an iron point . It is possible for one of these waqcexecaze to reach a man about 6 feet distant ; and even mounted men have been killed by them . Spears are used also in some of the dances . Around the shaft is wrapped the skin of a swan or brant . The end feather at the top is white ; the other feathers are white or spotted . The bent spear is no longer employed by the Omaha , though the Osage , Pawnee , and other tribes still use it to a greater or lesser extent . Bows . Illustration : Fig. 323.  --  Omaha bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Omaha bow ( takan-mand ) e ) Bows ( man-d ) e ) are of two kinds . One is the man-d ) e or zanzi-mand ) e ( bow-wood bow ) , having an unbroken curve past the grip to within an inch or two of each nock. 2 The other kind is the takan-mand ) e , so called because it has deer sinew glued on its back. 3 Bows were made of hickory , ash , ironwood , or zanzi , the last being greatly preferred . It is a wood resembling that of the Osage orange , with which some persons confound it ; but it is black and much harder than the former , the Osage orange wood being yellow , soft , and easily cut . The zanzi is probably that which Dougherty4 called " bow-wood ( Maclura aurantiaca of Nuttall ) . " Footnote 1 : See First Annual Report of Bureau of Ethnology , 1879- ' 80 ; 1881 , Pl .

Footnote 4 : Long 's Expedition , op. cit. , vol . I , p. 290 . Bowstrings were made of the twisted sinew of the elk and buffalo , as among other tribes . Arrows . Illustration : Fig. 325.  --  Omaha hunting arrow . The arrows ( man ) used in former days were of several kinds . The hunting arrow , used for killing the buffalo , was generally about 2 feet long , of the usual cylindric form , and armed with an elongate triangular point , made at first of flint , afterward of sheet iron . The shoulders of the arrow were rounded instead of angular , as in the ordinary barbed form . The point , or head , was firmly secured to the shaft by deer sinew wrapped around the neck of the point , and over that was spread some cement , made in a manner to be afterward explained . The flight of the arrow was equalized by three half-webs of feathers , neatly fastened near its base in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide nazic ) e , which was altogether of wood . About 6 inches from the point the shaft was triangular or quadrangular ; and the point was made by holding the shaft close to a fire and turning it round and round till the heat had reduced it to the proper shape and had hardened it . This was used for killing fish , deer , and small game . Illustration : Fig. 326.  --  Omaha war arrow . The war arrow ( b ) differed from that used in hunting in having a barbed point , which was very slightly attached to the shaft , so that if it penetrated the body of an enemy it could not be withdrawn without leaving the point in the wound . Illustration : Fig. 327.  --  Omaha style of hide-tace Children used the hide-tace , or target arrow , when they began to learn the use of the bow . With this a boy could kill small birds and animals . The Ponka used to make arrowshafts ( mansa ) of jan- ' qude-hi , " gray wood , " juneberry wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found among the Omaha . Most of the Omaha made their shafts of the man'saqtihi , or " real arrow-wood , " ( Viburnum ) as that was the wood best suited for the purpose . Sometimes they were made of chokecherry wood ; and Joseph LaFleche informs me that he has made them of ash and hickory . Arrowshafts were held lengthwise directly in a line with the eyes of the workman , who sighted along them to see if they were straight . If one was bent , he held one end of it between his teeth , while he pressed against the rest of it with his hands . They were polished by means of the polishers , or man ' - ciqcade , two pieces of sandstone , each of which had a groove in the middle of one side . These grooves were brought together , and the arrow was drawn between them . War arrows had crooked lines drawn along the shafts from the points to the other ends , down which , so I was informed by the Indians , it was intended that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahin-si ) , when made of flint , as at the first , were called " in ' , ( e mahinsi , " stone arrowheads . In more recent times , they were manufactured of pieces of sheet iron ; as , for example , hoops of pails and barrels . Arrow cement ( hin ' pa ) , for attaching the heads to the shafts , was usually made from the skin taken off a buffalo or elk head . This was boiled a long time , till ready to fall to pieces . When the gelatinous matter forming the cement rose to the top of the water , a stick ( called hinpa-janjin ' ga ) was thrust in and turned round and round , causing the material to be wrapped around it . When cooled it was smoothed with the hand . Then the act was repeated till a large quantity was collected on the stick . When needed for use , it was warmed by placing either in the mouth or in hot water . The skin of the big turtle was also used for making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " manwin ' dan . " A set generally consisted of ten arrows , but the number varied ; sometimes there were two , four , or even twenty . When a man had arrows left in his quiver , he compared them with that which was in the slain animal . When he had none left , he appealed to some one who knew his style of arrow . There were no clan or gentile marks on arrows . One set was distinguished from another by the order of the paint stripes on them , by the kind of feathers used , by the mode in which the arrowheads were made , etc . The Oto made bad arrows ; those of the Pawnee were better , but they were inferior to those made by the Dakota , Ponka , and Omaha . The feathers , half-webs generally , put on arrows were those of the eagle , buzzard , wild turkey , great owl , and goose . Sometimes hawk or crow feathers were employed . Quivers . Quivers ( man ' jiha ) for men were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of otter skins or of the skins of cougars , with the tail of the animal hanging down from the upper extremity . A skin case was attached to the quiver for carrying the bow when not in use . The wrist was defended from the percussion of the bowstring by the leather wristguard or aqande-pa . Shields and Armor . Shields ( tahawagce ) were made of the hides of buffalo bulls . They were round and very thick , reaching to the waist of the bearer . Arrows did not penetrate them . Joseph La Fleche never heard of the use of defensive armor , such as helmet and mail , among the Omaha and Ponka . He had heard of a Pawnee who made a coat from four elk skins , two forming the front and two the back . Between each pair of skins was placed sand . A helmet was made in like manner . It covered the back of the head and extended over the forehead , coming down as far as the eyes . When the Pawnee noticed an arrow coming toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were introduced among the Omaha prior to 1819 , when Dougherty says that they preferred those called " Mackinaw guns . " INDEX .
