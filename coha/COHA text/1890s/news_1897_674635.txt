txt An attempt was made to-day to burn the storehouse and offices at the State Prison . It failed because of the prompt discovery of the flames by a convict . A few minutes later there would have been no one about to discover them . It was noon , and the dinner call had sounded . Twelve hundred convicts had reached the mess hall and sat at the tables . The clothing workers were the last to reach the room . They had been delayed two minutes . They were crossing the yard under guard when one of them stepped from the line and motioned to the guards . He had discovered smoke coming from the storehouse windows . The prison fire alarm was sounded and the convicts assigned to fire duty responded . The mess hall doors were closed . The convicts were greatly excited , but by the coolness of the keepers and guards trouble was averted . The convict firemen ran out the hose-cart and were soon pouring water upon the flames . The prison fire department is equipped with all modern appliances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under control , then walked to the mess hall and quieted the frightened convicts . The big room where the fire broke out contains a large quantity of cloth and finished clothing . Some one had poured over the cloth in a dozen places a gallon and a half of oil and a gallon of benzine . Each of the saturated places had been yet un fire . The work was evidently that of a convict , who probably started the tires just as the dinner call sounded . Warden Sage ordered that one of the life convicts be locked up aria isolated . Who the prisoner is the Warden will not say , as he is not yet certain of his guilt . The loss is only $300 , but the fire endangered property valued at $125,000 . The object of the incendiary is supposed to have been to create a panic and obtain a chance to escape .
