EMERSON , SIXTY YEARS AFTER.1 I. " LEAVE this hypocritical prating about the masses . Masses are rude , lame , unmade , pernicious in their demands and influence , and need not to be flattered , but to be schooled . I wish not to concede anything to them , but to tame , drill , divide , and break them up , and draw mdi 1 It is now sixty years since Emerson 's first book was published , the pamphlet on Nature ( 1836 ) . viduals out of them . The worst of charity is that the lives you are asked to preserve are not worth preserving . Masses ! The calamity is the masses . I do not wish any mass at all , but honest men only , lovely , sweet , accomplished women only , and no shovel-handed , narrow-brained , gin-drinking million stockingers or lazzaroni at all . If government knew how , I should like to see it check , not mul // tiply the population . When it reaches its true law of action , every man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hurrah of masses , and let us have the considerate vote of single men spoken on their honor and their conscience . This extract from The Conduct of Life gives fairly enough the leading thought of Emerson 's life . The unending warfare between the individual and society shows us in each generation a poet or two , a dramatist or a musician who exalts and deifies the individual , and leads us back again to the only object which is really worthy of enthusiasm or which can permanently excite it , the character of a man . It is surprising to find this identity of content in all great deliveranccs . The only thing we really admire is personal liberty . Those who fought for it and those who enjoyed it are our heroes . But the hero may enslave his race by bringing in a system of tyranny ; the battle - cry of freedom may become a dogma which crushes the soul ; one good custom may corrupt the world . And so the inspiration of one age becomes the damnation of the next . This crystallizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may almost be regarded as one of the laws of progress . Emerson represents a protest against the tyranny of democracy . He is the most recent example of elemental hero-worship . His opinions are absolutely unqualified except by his temperament . He expresses a form of belief in the importance of the individual which is independent of any personal relations he has with the world . It is as if a man had been withdrawn from the earth and dedicated to condensing and embodying this eternal idea - the value of the individual soul-so vividly , so vitally , that his words could not die , yet in such illusive and abstract forms that by no chance and by no power could his creed be used for purposes of tyranny . Dogma can not be extracted from it . Schools can not be built on it . It either lives as the spirit lives , or else it evaporates and leaves nothing . Emerson was so afraid of the letter that killeth that he would hardly trust his words to print . He was assured there was no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore resorted to metaphors which could by no chance be taken literally . And he has probably succeeded in leaving a body of work which can not be made to operate to any other end than that for which he designed it . If this be true , he has accomplished the inconceivable feat of eluding misconception . If it be tine , he stands alone in the history of teachers ; he has circumvented fate , he has left an unmixed blessing behind him . The signs of those times which brought forth Emerson are not wholly undecipherable . They are the same times which gave rise to every character of significance during the period before the war . Emerson is indeed the easiest to understand of all the men of his time , because his life is freest from the tangles and qualifications of circumstance . He is a sheer and pure type and creature of destiny , and the unconsciousness that marks his development allies him to the deepest phenomena . It is convenient , in describing him , to use language which implies consciousness on his part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself ; he was a product . The years between 1820 and 1830 were the most pitiable through which this country has ever passed . The conscience of the North was pledged to the Missouri Compromise , and that Compromise neither slumbered nor slept . In New England , where the old theocratical oligarchy of the colonies had survived the Revolution and kept under its own water-locks the new floods of trade , the conservatism of politics reinforced the conservatism of religion ; and as if these two inquisitibus were not enough to stifle the soul of man , the conservatism of busi // ness self-interest was superimposed . The history of the conflicts which followed has been written by the radicals , who negligently charge up to self-interest all the resistance which establishments offer to change . But it was not solely selfinterest , it was conscience that backed the Missouri Compromise , nowhere else , naturally , so strongly as in New England . It was conscience that made cowards of us all . The white-lipped generation of Edward Everett were victims , one might even say martyrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can fall to man , a martyrdom which injured their immortal volition and dried up the springs of life . If it were not that our poets have too seldom deigned to dip into real life , I do not know what more awful subject for a poem could have been found than that of the New England judge enforcing the fugitive slave law . For lack of such a poem the heroism of these men has been forgotten , the losing heroism of conservatism . It was this spiritual power of a committed conscience which met the new forces as they arose , and it deserves a better name than these new forces afterward gave it . In 1830 the social fruits of these heavy conditions could be seen in the life of the people . Free speech was lost . " I know no country , " says De Tocqueville , who was here in 1831 , " in which there is so little independence of mind and freedom of discussion as in America . " De Tocqueville recurs to the point again and again . He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole philosophy and his book . The timidity of the Americans of this era was a thing which intelligent foreigners could not understand . Miss Martinean wrote in her Autobiography : " It was not till months afterwards that I was told that there were two reasons why I was not invited there Chelsea as elsewhere . One reason was that I had avowed , in reply to urgent questions , that I was disappointed in an oration of Mr. Everett 's ; and another was that I had publicly condemned the institution of slavery . I hope the Boston people have outgrown the childishness of sulking at opinions not in either case volunteered , but obtained by pressure . But really , the subservience to opinion at that time seemed a sort of mania . The mania was by no means confined to Boston , but qualified this period of our history throughout the Northern States . There was no literature . " If great writers have not at present existed in America , the reason is very simply given in the fact that there can be no literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not exist in America , " wrote De Tocqueville . There were no amusements , neither music nor sport nor pastime , indoors or out of doors . The whole life of the community was a life of the intelligence , and upon the intelligence lay the weight of intellectual tyranny . The pressure kept on increasing , and the suppressed forces kept on increasing , till at last , as if to show what gigantic power was needed to keep conservatism dominant , the Merchant Province put forward Daniel Webster . The worst period of panic seems to have preceded the anti-slavery agitations of 1831 , because these agitations soon demonstrated that the sky did not fall or the earth yawn and swallow Massachusetts because of Mr. Garrison 's opinions , as most people had sincerely believed would be the case . Some semblance of free speech was therefore gradually regained . Let us remember the world upon which the young Emerson 's eyes opened . The South was a plantation . The North crooked the hinges of the knee where thrift might follow fawning . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded oii fact . This time of humiliatio'h , when there was no free speech , no literature , little manliness , // no reality , no simplicity , no accomplishment , was the era of American brag . We flattered the foreigner and we boasted of ourselves . We were over-sensitive , insolent , and cringing . As late as 1845 , G. P. Putnam , a most sensible and modest man , published a book to show what the country had done in the field of culture . The book is a monument of the age . With all its good sense and good humor , it justifies foreign contempt because it is explanatory . Underneath everything lay a feeling of unrest , an instinct , - " this country can not permanently endure half slave and half free , " - which was the truth , but which could not be uttered . So long as there is any subject which men may not freely discuss , they are timid upon all subjects . They wear an iron crown and talk in whispers . Such social conditions crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as throughout the whole North , the individual was crushed and maimed . The generous youths who came to manhood between 1820 and 1830 , while this deadly era was maturing , seem to have undergone a revulsion against the world almost before touching it ; at least two of them suffered , revolted , and condemned , while still boys sitting on benches in school , and came forth advancing upon this old society like gladiators . The activity of William Lloyd Garrison , the man of action , preceded by several years that of Emerson who is his prophet . Both of them were parts of one revolution . One of Emerson 's articles of faith was that a man 's thoughts spring from his actions rather than his actions from his thoughts , and possibly the same thing holds good for society at large . Perhaps all truths , whether moral or economic , must be worked out in real life before they are discovered by the student , and it was therefore necessary that Garrison should be evolved earlier than Emerson . The silent years of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to his ministry , known by few , understood by none , least of all by himself , were years in which the revolting spirit of an archangel thought out his creed . He came forth perfect , with that serenity of which we have scarce another example in history , - that union of the man himself , his beliefs , and his vehicle of expression that makes men great because it makes them comprehensible . The philosophy into which lie had already transmuted all his earlier theology at the time we first meet him consisted of a very simple drawing together of a few ideas , all of which had long been familiar to the world . It is the wonderful use he made of these ideas , the closeness with which they fitted his soul , the tact with which he took what he needed , like a bird building its nest , that make the originality , the man . The conclusion of Berkeley , that the external world is known to us only through our impressions , and that therefore , for aught we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not be disproved . It is so simple a conception that a child may understand it ; and it has probably been passed before the attention of every thinking man since Plato 's time . The notion is in itself a mere philosophical catch or crux to which there is no answer . It may be true . The mystics made this doctrine useful . They were not content to doubt the independent existence of the external world . They imagined that this external world , the earth , the planets , the phenomena of nature , bore some relation to the emotions arid destiny of the soul . The soul and the cosmos were somehow i-elated , and related so intimately that the cosmos might be regarded as a sort of projection or diagram of the soul . Plato was the first man who perceived that this idea* could be made to provide the philosopher with a vehicle of expres // sion more powerful than any other . If a man will once plant himself firmly on the proposition that he is the universe , that every emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to phenomena in the external world , and that he shall say how correlated , he is in a position where the power of speech is at a maximum . His figures of speech , his tropes , his witticisms , take rank with the law of gravity and the precession of the equinoxes . Philosophical exaltation of the individual can not go beyond this point . It is the climax . This is the school of thought to which Emerson belonged . The sun and moon , the planets , are mere symbols . They signify whatever the poet chooses . The planets for the most part stay in conjunction just long enough to flash his thought through their symbolism , and no permanent relation is established between the soul and the zodiac . There is , however , one link of correlation between the external and internal worlds which Emerson considered established , and in which he believed almost literally , namely , the moral law . This idea he drew from Kant through Coleridge and Wordsworth , and it is so familiar to us all that it hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , the beautiful , - all things of which we instinctively approve , - are somehow connected together and are really one thing ; that our appreciation of them is in its essence the recognition of a law ; that this law , in fact all law and the very idea of law , is a mere subjective experience ; and that hence any external sequence which we coiirdinate and name , like the law of gravity , is really intimately connected with our moral nature , - this fancy has probably some basis of truth . Emerson adopted it as a corner-stone of his thought . Such are the ideas at the basis of Emerson 's philosophy , and it is fair to speak of them in this place because they antedate everything else which we know of him . They had been for years in his mind before he spoke at all . It was in the armor of this invulnerable idealism and with weapons like shafts of light that he came forth to fight . In 1836 , at the age of thirty-three , Emerson published the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state his creed . Although still young , he was not without experience of life . He had been assistant minister to the Rev. Dr. Ware from 1829 to 1832 , when he resigned his ministry on account of his views regarding the Lord 's Supper . He had married and lost his first wife in the same interval . He had been abroad and had visited Carlyhe in 1833 . He had returned and settled in Concord , and had taken up the profession of lecturing , upon which he in part supported himself ever after . It is unnecessary to review these early lectures . " Large portions of them , " says Mr. Cabot , his biographer , " appeared afterwards in the Essays , especially those of the first series . Suffice it that through them Emerson had become so well known that although Nature was published anonymously , he was recognized as the author . Many people had heard of him at the time he resigned his charge , and the story went abroad that the young minister of the Second Church had gone mad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to corroborate it . Such was the impression which the book made upon Boston in 1836 . As we read it to-day , we are struck by its extraordinary beauty of language . It is a supersensuous , lyrical , and sincere rhapsody , written evidently by a man of genius . It reveals a nature compelling respect , - a Shelley , and yet a sort of Yankee Shelley , who is mad only when the wind is nor - nor'wcst ; a mature nature which must have been nourished for years upon its own thoughts , to speak this new language so eloquently , to stand so calmly on its feet . The deliverance of his thought is so perfect that this work adapts itself to our mood and has the // quality of poetry . This fluency Emerson soon lost ; it is the quality missing in his poetry . It is the efilorescence of youth . The pamphlet called Nature showed the clouds of speculation in which Emerson had been walking . With what lightning they were charged was soon seen . In 1837 he was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the opportunity for which he had been waiting . The mystic and eccentric young poet-preacher now speaks his mind , and he turns out to be a man exclusively interested in real life . This recluse , too tender for contact with the rough facts of the world , whose conscience has retired him to rural Concord , pours out a vial of wrath . This cub puts forth the paxv of a full-grown lion . Emerson has left behind him nothing stronger than this address , The American Scholar . It was the first application of his views to the events of his day , written and delivered in the heat of early manhood while his extraordinary powers were at their height . It moves with a logical progression of which he soon lost the habit . The subject of it , the scholar 's relation to the world , wa* the passion of his life . The body of his belief is to be found in this address , and in any adequate account of him the whole address ought to be given . " Thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give to letters any more . As such it is precious as the sign of an indestructible instinct . Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be , and will be , something else ; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectation of the world with something better than the exertions of mechanical skill . . . . Yet hence arises a grave mischief . The sacredness which attaches to the act of creation , the act of thought , is transferred to the record . The poet chanting was felt to be a divine man : henceforth the chant is divine , also . The writer was a just and wise spirit : henceforward it is settled the book is perfect ; as love of the hero corrupts into worship of his statue . Instantly the book becomes noxious : the guide is a tyrant . . . . These being his functions , it becomes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to the popular cry . He , and he only , knows the world . The world of any moment is the merest appearance . Some great decorum , some fetish of a government , some ephemeral trade , or war , or man , is cried up by half mankind and cried down by the other half , as if all depended on this particular up or down . The odds are that the whole question is not worth the poorest thought which the scholar has lost in listening to the controversy . Let him not quit his belief that a popgun is a popgun , though the ancient and honorable of the earth affirm it to be the crackof doom . " Dr. Holmes called this speech of Emerson ' s our " intellectual Declaration of Independence , " and indeed it was . " The Phi Beta Kappa speech , " says Mr. Lowell , " was an event without any f ormer parallel in our literary annals , - a scene always to be treasured in the memory for its picturesqueness and its inspiration . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , what enthusiasm of approval , what grim silence of foregone dis-sent ! The authorities of the Divinity School can hardly have been very careful readers of Nature and rI*he American Scholar , or they would not have invited Emerson , in 1838 , to deliver the address to the graduating class . This was Emerson 's second opportunity to apply his beliefs directly to society . A few lines out of the famous address are enough to show that he saw in the church of his day signs of the same decadence that he saw in the letters : " The prayers and even the dogmas of // our church are like the zodiac of Denderah and the astronomical monuments of the Hindoos , wholly insulated from anything now extant in the life and business of the people . They mark the height to which the waters once rose . . . It is the office of a true teacher to show us that God is , not was ; that he speaketh , not spake . The true Christianity - a faith like Christ 's in the infinitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man , but only in some man or person old and departed . Ah me ! no man goeth alone . All men go in flocks to this saint or that poet , avoiding the God who seeth in secret . They can not see in secret ; they love to he blind in public . They think society wiser than their soul , and know not that one soul , and their soul , is wiser than the whole world . " It is almost misleading to speak of the lofty utterances of these early addresses as attacks upon society , but their reception explains them . The element of absolute courage is the same in all natures . Emerson himself was not unconscious of what function he was performing . The " storm in our wash-bowl " which followed this Divinity School address , the letters of remonstrance from friends , the advertisements by the Divinity School of " no complicity , " must have been cheering to Emerson . His unseen yet dominating ambition is shown throughout the address , and in this note in his diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday at the Phi Beta Kappa anniversary . Steady , steady . I am convinced that if a man will be a true scholar he shall have perfect freedom . The young people and the mature hint at odium and the aversion of forces to be presently encountered in society . I say No ; I fear it not . " The lectures and addresses which form the latter half of the first volume in the collected edition show the early Emerson in the ripeness of his powers . These writings have a lyrical sweep and a beauty which the later works often lack . Passages in them remind us of Hamlet " How silent , how spacious , what room for all , yet without space to insert an atom ; - in graceful succession , in equal fulness , in balanced beauty , the dance of the hours goes forward still . Like an odor of incense , like a strain of music , like a sleep , it is inexact and boundless . It will not be dissected , nor unravelled , nor shown . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race the Pilgrims ? We can not have theirs ; it glides away from us day by day ; but we also can bask in the great morning which rises forever out of the eastern sea , and be ourselves the children of the light . I stand here to say , Let us worship the mighty and transcendent Soul . " Emerson is never far from his main thought : - " The universe does not attract us till it is housed in an individual . " " A man , a personal ascendency , is the only great phenomenon . " " I can not find language of sufficient energy to convey my sense of the sacredne*s of private integrity . " On the other hand , he is never far from his great fear : " But Truth is such a fly-away , such a sly-boots , so untransportable and unbarrelable a commodity , that it is as bad to catch as light . " " Let him beware of proposing to himself any end . I say to you plainly , there is no end so sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become carnon and an offence to the nostril . " There can be nothing finer than Emerson 's knowledge of the world , his sympathy with young men and with the practical difficulties of applying his teachings . We can see in his early lectures before students and mechanics how much he had learned about the structure of society from his own short contact with the organized church . Behind all lay a greater matter , - his grasp of the forms and conditions of progress , // his reach of intellect which could afford fair play to every one . His lecture on The Conservative is not a puzzling jeu d'esprit like Bishop Blougram 's Apology , but an honest attempt to set up the opposing chessmen of conservatism and reform so as to represent real life . Hardly . can such a brilliant statement of the case be found elsewhere in literature . It is not necessary to quote here the reformer 's side of the question , for Emerson 's whole life was devoted to it . The conservatives ' attitude he gives with such accuracy and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be speaking : - " The order of things is as good as the character of the population permits . Consider it as the work of a great and beneficent and progressive necessity , which , from the first pulsation in the first animal life up to the present high culture of the best nations , has advanced thus far . " " The conservative party in the universe concedes that the radical would talk sufficiently to the purpose if we were still in the garden of Eden ; he legislates for man as he ought to be ; his theory is right , but he makes no allowance for friction , and this omission makes his whole doctrine false . The idealist retorts that the conservative falls into a far more noxious error in the other extreme . The conservative assumes sickness as a necessity , and his social frame is a hospital , his total legislation is for the present distress , a universe in slippers and flannels , with bib and papspoon , swallowing pills and herb tea . Sickness gets organized as well as health , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary to go , one by one , through the familiar essays and lectures which Emerson published between 1838 and 1875 . They are in everybody 's hands and in everybody 's thoughts . In 1840 he wrote in his diary : " In all my lectures I have taught one doctrine , namely , the infinitude of the private man . This the people accept readily enough , and even with commendation , as long as I call the lecture Art or Politics , or Literature or the Household ; but the moment I call it Religion they are shocked , though it be only the application of the same truth ' which they receive elsewhere to a new class of facts . " To the platform he returned , and left it only once or twice during the remainder of his life . His writings vary in coherence . In his early occasional pieces , like the Phi Beta Kappa address , coherence is at a maximum . They were written for a purpose , and were perhaps struck off all at once . But he earned his living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and using it in different forms . A lecturer has no prejudice against repetition . It is noticeable that in some of Emerson 's important lectures the logical scheme is more perfect than in his essays . The truth seems to be that in the process of working up and perfecting his writings , in revising and filing his sentences , the logical scheme became more and more obliterated . Another circumstance helped make his style fragmentary . He was by nature a man of inspirations and exalted moods . He was subject to ecstasies , during which his mind worked with phenomenal brilliancy. rhroughout his works and in his diary we find constant reference to these moods , and to his own inability to control or recover them . " But what we want is consecutiveness . T is with us a flash of light , then a long darkness , then a flash again . Ah ! could we turn these fugitive sparkles into an astronomy of Copernican worlds ! " In order to take advantage of these periods of divination , he used to write down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyhood onward he kept journals and commonplace books , and in the course of his reading and meditation he collected innumerable notes and quotations which he indexed for ready use . In these mines he " quar // ned , " as Mr. Cabot says , for his lectures and essays . When he needed a lecture he went to the repository , threw together what seemed to have a bearing on some subject , and gave it a title , If any other man should adopt this method of composition , the result would be incomprehensible chaos ; because most men have many interests , many moods , many and conflicting ideas . But with Emerson it was otherwise . There was only one thought which could set him aflame , and that was the thought of the unfathomed might of man . This thought was his religion , his politics , his ethics , his philosophy . One moment of inspiration was in him own brother to the next moment of inspiration , although they might be separated by six weeks . When he came to put together his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what order he placed them , because they were all part of the same idea . His works are all one single attack on the vice of the age , moral cowardice . He assails it not by railings and scorn , but by positive and stimulating suggestion . The imagination of the reader is touched by every device which can awake the admiration for heroism , the consciousness of moral courage . Wit , quotation , anecdote , eloquence , exhortation , rhetoric , sarcasm , and very rarely denunciation are launched at the reader , till he feels little lambent flames beginning to kindle in him . He is perhaps unable to see the exact logical connection between two paragraphs of an essay , yet ' he feels they are germane . He takes up Emerson tired and apathetic , but presently he feels himself growing heady and truculent , strengthened in his most inward vitality , surprised to find himself again master in his own house . The difference between Emerson and the other moralists is that all these stimulating pictures and suggestions are not given by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through the mill of generalization in his own mind . He himself could not have told you their logical bearing on one another . They have all the vividness of disconnected fragments of life , and yet they all throw light on one another , like the facets of a jewel . But whatever cause it was that led him to adopt his method of writing , it is certain that he succeeded in delivering himself of his thought with an initial velocity and carrying power such as few men ever attained . He has the force at his commnand of the thrower of the discus . His style is American , and beats with the pulse of the climate . He is the only writer we have had who writes as he speaks , who makes no literary parade , has no pretensions of any sort . He is the only writer we have had who has wholly subdued his vehicle to his temperament . It is impossible to name his style without naming his character : they are one thing . Both in language and in elocution Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to command his effects and to conceal his means . The casual practical , disarming directness with which he writes puts any honest man at his mercy . What difference does it make whether a man who can talk like this is following an argument or not ? You can not always see Emerson clearly ; he is hidden by a high wall ; but you always know exactly on what spot he is standing . You judge it by the flight of the objects lie throws over the wall , - a bootjack , an apple , a crown , a razor , a volume of verse . With one or other of these missiles , all delivered with a very tolerable aim , he is pretty sure to hit you . These catchwords stick in the mind . People are not in general influenced by long books or discourses , but by odd fragments of observation which they overhear , sentences or head - lines which they read while turning over a book at random or while waiting for dinner to be announced . These are the oracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bend a man 's most stubborn xviii . Emerson called them the Police of the Universe . His works are a treasury of such things . They sparkle in the mine , or you may carry them off in your pocket . They get driven into your mind like nails , and on them catch and hang your own experiences , till what was onoe his thought has become your character . " God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose . Take which you please ; you can never have both . " " Discontent is want of self-reliance ; it is infirmity of will . " " It is impossible for a man to be cheated by any one but himself . " The orchestration with which Emerson introduces and sustains these notes from the spheres is as remarkable as the winged things theniselves . Open his works at a hazard . You hear a man talking . " A garden is like those pernicious machineries we read of every month in the newspapers , which catch a man 's coat-skirt or his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole body to irresistible destruction . In an evil hour he pulled down his wall and added a field to his homestead . No land is bad , but land is worse . If a man own land , the land owns him . Now let hini leave home if he dare . Every tree and graft , every hill of melons , row of corn , or quickset hedge , all he has done and all he means to do , stand in his way like duns , when he would go out of his gate . " Your attention is arrested by the reality of this gentleman in his garden , by the first-hand quality of his mind . It matters not on what subject he talks . While you are musing , still pleased and patronizing , he has picked up the bow of Ulysses , bent it with the ease of Ulysses , and sent a shaft clear through the twelve axes , nor missed one of them . But this , it seems , was mere byplay and marksmanship ; for before you have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pours flight after flight , arrow after arrow , from the great bow . The shafts sing and strike , the suitors fall in heaps . The broxv of Ulysses shines with unearthly splendor . The air is filled with lightning . After a little , without shock or transition , without apparent change of tone , Mr. Emerson is offering you a biscuit before you leave , and bidding you mind the last step at the garden end . If the man who can do these things be not an artist , then must we have a new vocabulary and re-name the professions . There is , in all this effectiveness of Emerson , no pose , no literary art ; nothing that corresponds even remotely to the pretended modesty and ignorance with which Socrates lays pitfalls for our admiration in Plato 's dialogues . It was the platform which determined Emerson 's style . He was not a writer , but a speaker . On the platform his manner of speech was a living part of his words . The pauses and hesitation , the abstraction , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaves of his lecture , and then the discovery , the illumination , the gleam of lightning which you saw before your eyes descend into a man of genius , - all this was Emerson . He invented this style of speaking , and made it express the supersensuous , the incommunicable . Lowell wrote , while still under the spell of the magician : " Emerson 's oration was more disjointed than usual , even with him . It began nowhere , and ended everywhere , and yet , as always with that divine man , it left you feeling that something beautiful had passed that way , something more beautiful than anything else , like the rising and setting of stars . Every possible criticism might have been made on it but one , - that it was not noble . There was a tone in it that awakened all elevating associations . He boggled , he lost his place , he had to put on his glasses ; but it was as if a creature from some fairer world had lost his way in our fogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was chaotic , but it was all such stuff as stars are made of , and you could n't help feeling that , if you waited awhile , all that was nebulous would he whirled into planets , and would assume the mathematical gravity of system . All through it I felt something in me that cried , Ha ! ha ! ' to the sound of the trumpets . " It is nothing for any man sitting in his chair to be overcome with the sense of the immediacy of life , to feel the spur of courage , the victory of good over evil , the value now and forever of all great-hearted endeavor . Such moments come to us all . But for a man to sit in his chair and write what shall call up these forces in the bosoms of others , - that is desert , that is greatness . To do this was the gift of Emerson . The whole earth is enriched by every moment of converse with him . The shows and shams of life become transparent , the lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are opened , and provinces and realms of our own existence lie gleaming before us . It has been necessary to reduce the living soul of Emerson to mere dead attributes like " moral courage " in order that we might talk about him at all . His effectiveness comes from his character ; not from his philosophy , nor from his rhetoric nor his wit , nor from any of the accidents of his education . He might never have heard of Berkeley or Plato . A slightly different education might have led him to throw his teaching into the form of historical essays or of stump speeches . He.might , perhaps , have been bred a stone-mason , and have done his work in the world by traveling with a panorama . But he would always have been Emerson . His weight and his power would always have been the same . It is solely as character that he is important . He discovered nothing ; he bears no relation whatever to the history of philosophy . We must regard him and deal with him simply as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting him as a thinker : and hence a great coil of misunderstanding . As a thiuker , Emerson is difficult to classify . Before you begin to assign him a place , you must clear the ground by a disquisition as to what is meant by " a thinker , " and how Emerson differs from other thinkers . As a man , Emerson is as plain as Ben Frankun . People have accused him of inconsistency ; they say that he teaches one thing one day , and another the next day . But from the point of view of Emerson there is no such thing as inconsistency . Every man is each day a new man . Let him be to-day what he is to-day . It is immaterial and waste of time to consider what he once was or what he may be . His picturesque speech delights in fact and anecdote , and a public which is used to treatises and deduction cares always to be told the moral . It wants everything reduced to a generalization . All generalizations are partial truths , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper allowance . Emerson 's method is , not to give a generalization and trust to our making the allowance , but to give two conflicting statements and leave the . balance of truth to be struck in our own minds on the facts . There is no inconsistency in this . It is a vivid and very legitimate method of procedure . But he is much more than a theorist : he is a practitioner . He does not merely state a theory of agitation : he proceeds to agitate . " Do not , " he says , " set the least value on what I do , or the least discredit on what I do not , as if I pretended to settle anything as false or true . I unsettle all things . No facts are to me sacred , none are profane . I simply experiment , an endless seeker with no past at my back . " He was not engaged in teaching many things , but one thing , - Courage . Sometimes he inspires it by pointing to great characters , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspires it by bidding us beware of imitating such men , and , in the ardor of his rhetoric , even seems to regard them as hindrances and dangers to our development . There is no inconsistency here . Emerson might logically have gone one step further and raised inconsistency into a jewel . For what is so useful , so educational , so inspiring , to a timid and conservative man , as to do something inconsistent and regrettable ? It lends character to him at once . He breathes freer and is stronger for the experience . Emerson is no cosmopolitan . He is a patriot . He is not like Goethe , whose sympathies did not run on national lines . Emerson has America in his mind 's eye all the time . There is to be a new religion , and it is to come from America : a new and better type of man , and he is to be an American . He not only cared little or nothing for Europe , but he cared not mucb for the world at large . His thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get into any chamber in his mind which is below this chamber of patriotism . He loves the valor of Alexander and the grace of the Oxford athlete ; but he loves them not for themselves . He has a use for them , They are grist to his mill and powder to his gun . His admiration of them he subordinates to his main purpose , - they are his blackboard and diagrams . His patriotism is the backbone of his significance . He came to his countrymen at a time when they lacked , not thoughts , but manliness . The needs of his own particular public are always before him . " It is odd that our people should have , not water on the brain , but a little gas there . A shrewd foreigner said of the Americans that whatever they say has a little the air of a speech . ' " " I shall not need to go into an enumeration of our national defects and vices which require this Order of Censors in the State . . . . The timidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , the publicness of opinion , the absence of private opinion . " " Our measure of success is the moderation and low level of an individual 's judgment . Dr. Channing 's piety and wisdom had such weight in Boston that the popular idea of religion was whatever this eminent divine held . " " Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity , the squalid contentment of the times . " The politicians he scores constantly . The following is his description of the social world of his day : " If any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction society , he will see the need of these ethics . The sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out , and we are become timorous , desponding whimperers . " It is the same wherever we open his books . He must spur on , feed up , bring forward the dormant character of his countrymen . When he goes to England , lie sees in English life nothing except those elements which are deficient in American life . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read English Traits . Emerson 's patriotism had the effect of expanding his philosophy . Today we know the value of physique , for science has taught it , but it was hardly discovered in his day , and his philosophy affords no basis for it . Emerson in this matter transcends his philosophy . When in England , he was fairly made drunk with the physical life he found there . He is like Caspar Hauser gazing for the first time on green fields . English Traits is the ruddiest book he ever wrote . It is a hymn to force , honesty , and physical well-being , and ends with the dominant note of his belief : " By this general activity and by this sacredness of individuals , they the English have in seven hundred years evolved the principles of freedom . It is the land of patriots , martyrs , sages , and bards , and if the ocean out df which it emerged should wash it away , it will be remembered as // an island famous for immortal laws , for the announcements of original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had found in England free speech , personal courage , and reverence for the individual . No convulsion could shake Emerson or make his view unsteady even for an instant . What no one else saw , he saw , and he saw nothing else . Not a boy in the land welcomed the outbreak of the war so fiercely as did this shy village philosopher , then at the age of fiftyeight . He saw that war was the cure for cowardice , moral as well as physical . It was not the cause of the slave that moved him ; it was not the cause of the Union for which he cared a farthing . It was something deeper than either of these things for which he had been battling all his life . It was the cause of character against convention . Whatever else the war might bring , it was sure to bring in character , to leave behind it a file of heroes ; if not heroes , then villains , but in any case strong men . On the 9th of April , 1861 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken with equanimity of " the downfall of our character , destroying civilization . . . . We find that civilization crowed too soon , that our triumphs were treacheries ; we had opened the wrong door and let the enemy into the castle . " " Ah , " he said , when the firing began , " sometimes gunpowder smells good . " Soon after the attack on Sumter he said in a public address , " We have been very homeless for some years past , say since 1850 ; but now we have a country again . " " The war was an eye-opener , and showed men of all parties and opinions the value of those primary forces that lie beneath all political action . " And it was almost a personal pledge when he said at the 1-Jarvard Commemoration in 1865 , " We shall not again disparage America , now that we have seen what men it will bear , " The place which Emerson forever occupies as a great critic is defined by the same sharp outlines that mark his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A critic in the modern sense he was not , for his point of view is fixed , and he reviews the world like a search-light placed on the top of a tall tower . He lived too early and at too great a distance from the forum of European thought to absorb the ideas of evolution and give place to them in his philosophy . Evolution does not graft well upon the Platonic Idealism , nor are physiology and the kindred sciences sympathetic . Nothing aroused Emerson 's indignation more than the attempts of the medical faculty and of phrenologists to classify , and therefore limit individuals . " The grossest ignorance does not disgust me like this ignorant knowingness . " We miss in Emerson the underlying conception of growth , of development , so characteristic of the thought of our own day , and which , for instance , is found everywhere latent in Browning 's poetry . Browning regards character as the result of experience and as an ever changing growth . To Emerson , character is rather an entity complete and eternal from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at life from a stationary standpoint . There is a certain lack of the historic sense in all he has written . The ethical assumption that all men are exactly alike permeates his work . In his mind , Socrates , Marco Polo , and General Jackson stand surrounded by the same atmosphere , or rather stand as mere naked characters surrounded by no atmosphere at all . He is probably the last great writer who will fling about classic anecdotes as if they were club gossip . In the discussion of morals , this assumption does little harm . The stories and proverbs which illustrate the thought of the moralist generally concern only those simple relations of life which are common to all // ages . There is charm in this familiar dealing with antiquity . The classics are thus domesticated and made real to us . What matter if ZEsop appear a little too much like an American citizen , so long as his points tell ? It is in Emerson 's treatment of the fine arts that we begin to notice his want of historic sense . Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conventions which are as protean as the forms of a cloud ; and the man who in speaking on the plastic arts makes the assumption that all men are alike will reveal before he has uttered three sentences that he does not know what art is , that he has never experienced any form of sensation from it . Emerson lived in a time and clime where there was no plastic art , and he was obliged to arrive at his ideas about art by means of a highly complex process of reasoning . He dwelt constantly in a spiritual place which was the very focus of high moral fervor . This was his enthusiasm , this was his revelation , and from it he reasoned out the probable meaning of the fine arts . " This , " thought Emerson , his eye rolling in a fine frenzy of moral feeling , " this must be what Apelles experienced , this fervor is the passion of Bramante . I understand the Parthenon . " And so he projected his feelings about morality into the field of the plastic arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of artists , - Phidias , Raphael , Salvator Rosa , - and he speaks always in such a way that it is impossible to connect what he says with any impression we have ever received from the works of those masters . In fact , Emerson has never in his life felt the normal appeal of any painting , or any sculpture , or any architecture , or any music . These things , of which he does not know the meaning in real life , he yet uses , and uses constantly , as symbols to convey ethical truths . The result is that his books are full of blind places , like the notes which will not strike on a sick piano . It is interesting to find that the one art of which Emerson did have a direct understanding , the art of poetry , gave him some insight into the relation of the artist to his vehicle . In his essay on Shakespeare there is a full recognition of the debt of Shakespeare to his times . This essay is filled with the historic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation of the fine arts , but rather admire the truly Goethean spirit in which he insisted upon the reality of arts of which he had no understanding . This is the same spirit which led him to insist on the value of the Eastern poets . Perhaps there exist a few scholars who can tell us how far Emerson understood or misunderstood Saadi and Firdusi and the Koran . But we need not be disturbed for his learning . It is enough that he makes us recognize that these men were men too , and that their writings mean something not unknowable to us . The East added nothing to Emerson , but gave him a few trappings of speech . The whole of his mysticism is to be found in Nature , written before he knew the sages of the Orient , and it is not improbable that there is some real connection between his own mysticism and the mysticism of the Eastern poets . Emerson 's criticism on men and books is like the test of a great chemist who seeks one or two elements . He burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the lines of it in his spectrum , and there an end . It was a thought of genius that led him to write Representative Men . The scheme of this hook gave play to every illumination of his mind , and it pinned him down to the objective , to the field of vision under his microscope . The table of contents of Representative Men is the dial of his education . It is as follows : Uses of Great Men ; Plato , or The Philosopher ; Plato , New Readings ; // Swedenborg , or The Mystic ; Montaigne , or The Skeptic ; Shakespeare , or The Poet ; Napoleon , or The Man of the World ; Goethe , or The Writer . The predominance of the writers over all other types of men is not cited to show Emerson 's interest in The Writer , for we know his interest centred in the practical man , - even his ideal scholar is a practical man , - but to show the sources of his illustration . Emerson 's library was the old-fashioned gentleman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classics . This is one reason why he so quickly gained an international currency . His very subjects in Representative Men are of universal interest , and he is limited only by certain inevitable local conditions . Representative Men is thought by many persons to be his best book . It is certainly filled with the strokes of a master . There exists no more profound criticism than Emerson 's analysis of Goethe and of Napoleon , by both of whom he was at once fascinated and repelled.
