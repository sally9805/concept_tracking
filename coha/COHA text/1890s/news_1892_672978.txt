txt There is no disputing that thus far the English elections have been less favorable to the Liberals than was expected either by them or by their adversaries . The LiberalUnionists have indeed suffered very considerable loss , and it seems safe to predict that they will be much less important in the next House than they were in the last , and . that a Liberal-Unionist will henceforth be a person without any very definite political aspirations . Lord SALISBURY complained the other day of the tiresome and everlasting Irish question which prevented Parliament from considering British social questions . It may be questioned . whether , as a politician , ho has not , after all , reason to be grateful to it . If it were settled and out of the way , the Conservative Party could scarcely appeal with confidence to the people upon any one of the domestic questions by which ho professes to set so much store . The question of Parliamentary reform , which was a burning question for more than half a century , has now been settled by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intents and purposes , amounts to universal . suffrage . ' The coming questions are those upon which the democracy has its own views , and . with its greatly-increased political strength is likely to have its own way . By the nature of the case the aristocratic party can not provide it with what it wants , however cynically ready ambitious politicians of that party may be to meet its demand . It is to the party of the people that the voters will make their appeal . There will be a very great temptation to demagogical legislation in the interest of what may be called " the masses , " but are really only very numerous classes , and the work of the Liberal leaders will be to withstand this temptation , as it was withstood by- Mr. GLADSTONE the other day in his masterly analysis of the demand for an eight-hour law . The temptation of the Conservative Party will of course be to outbid its opponents for the favor of the new voters , but these find their natural organ in the Liberal Party . Upon questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituencies with much more hope of success . Upon these the Tories have that kind of traditional policy that belongs to them as an aristocratic party , whereas their opponents , having no traditions , are much more at the mercy of any sudden gust of popular sentiment . At present , however , England . can scarcely be said to be a European power . It is only when her system of dependencies is directly involved that she can be said to be brought into Continental politics , and the questions of those politics now uppermost do not appeal to British interests , except iu so far as the aggrandizement of Russia threatens British rule in India . The burning questions of British politics are domestic questions , and they are questions upon which , if the Irish question were out of the way , there can be no doubt that the Liberals would carry the country . The Irish question is thus a blessing , though somewhat in disguise , to the Tory politicians . It has supplied them with allies who have made their majority secure throughout Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have brought directly into the Conservative camp all the voters whose sympathies upon other points are with the Liberals , but who are opposed to the Liberals upon the Irish question , and who regard that as the controlling question in British politics . That it is so , and that it will continue to be so until it is settled , there can be very little question . It was by reason of the supposed conversion of the British people to the notion of home rule that it was expected . that Mr. GLADSTONE could carry the present elections by a decisive majority . The expectation was not unreasonable . The Irish themselves had done a good deal to thwart it by the lamentable spectacle they had been presenting ever since Mr. PARNELL 'S death . Nevertheless , after the Irish schism had had time to produce its results , the English bye - elections seemed to show that the English people agreed with Lord SALISBURY that the Irish question ought to be got rid of , but disagreed with him in holding that it ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to solve it with obvious makeshifts , as is the prescription of the Conservatives , and as has been , until very lately , the English policy . The general elections have thus far not borne out the promise of the bye-elections . They seem to prefigure the return to power of Mr. GLADSTONE , it is trite , but by a. majority so small and precarious as to leave rather vague and uncertain the mandate of the nation for a settlement of the Irish question by the enactment of a measure which shall leave to Ireland the regulation of exclusively Irish affairs , while still keeping the British Empire a united power as against all foreign countries . This is the result that everybody must have hoped who recognized in the Irish question the secular trouble of British politics . It may be that it will yet be reached . by the polling in the districts of which the elections have not yet been held . It seems quite clear that otherwise the Irish question will continue to recur until it is settled . once for all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish people .
