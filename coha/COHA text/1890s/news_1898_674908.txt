txt GOVERNMENT om . x. - remmt .. ro mace , . I To the Editor of The New York THE TIMES was never happier in its subject than in the article printed yesterday on language , making the application as to our Government of Puerto Rico and the use there of ours . But with all possible respect for THE ) TIMES and the writer of the article , the writer touched only the surface of the matter . If the United States expects to bold the island we must understand very clearly the terms . It can be done in but two ways , viz. , as Spain has held it , or as an additional State . I question the consent of the American people to the former plan . We have bad trouble enough with the Indians not to desire to add another ward . I suppose that we can take care of the Hawaiian matter , simply treating them as uncivilized people , as we treat the Indians ; but the Puerto Ricans are different . We can not consent to control them without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nal representation , nor are they likely to consent themselves to any other plan . 7:t is therefore desirable that we consider the t ecult of the use of two or more languages Under a common Government . We know what a difficult task we have bad and are having in assimilating other elements , and taking that into consideration , it is worth while to look el the history and present results of the attempts of others t3 do the same thing . Our cousins on the north furnish a striking illustration . Canadians tell me that one of the terms of the surrender of Canada by France was that the use of the French language or the privilege to use it should be guaranteed perpetually to the French colonists . This Is probably true , at all events , it is a fact that there are two official languages there now , a century and more since that event . . As a direct result of this , you find in Montreal on one side of the municipal building In the foliage bed . " Maison de Vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rotunda on one side committee notices in French , on the other in English . A business friend tells me that legal notices written in French served on one who does not read that language arc legal . The friction is so great that a Quebec lady whom I met on the lower St. Lawrence a few years ago said that when she went to Montreal and went into a store to make a purchase , she spoke French ; if the salesman answered in English she said in French : " I do n't understand . I am not English ; I am French , " and if some one speaking French was not Instantly found that she left the store . I think that the above is a fail illustration of what the Canadians suffer from the use of two languages , and what is to be expected from the use ; therefore , I think that your writer absolutely failed in representing the danger which is to be faced . The matter is a very serious one , and it is desirable that instead of directing attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you nut it on the other side of the page end point at it until It is understood . J.
