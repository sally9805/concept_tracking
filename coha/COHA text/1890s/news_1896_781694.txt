txt The Republicans at St. Louis adopted a declaration of three distinct points as to the currency : 1 . International bimetallism , which they pledged thzmselves to promote . 2 . The maintenance of the gold standard in the United States until international bimetallism can be obtained . 3 . The maintenance of all our silver and paper currency at parity with gold . There was , besides , a good deal of verbiage , but these three points are all there is of substance in the Republican declaration . How can an issue be made on this declaration ? In one of two ways only . By a platform declaring against bimetallism in any form , international or other . That way need not be considered . No party will take it . There is a certain number of men  --  strong and well-informed men they are , too  --  who do not believe that bimetallism in any shape is practicable , but there is no party that holds this belief , and at present no chance for any . The men who believe this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their views or not vote at all . The second way to make an Issue on the Republican declaration is to declare for the free and unlimited and independent coinage of silver . That is What the Populists will do . It Is what the Teller free-silver Republicans have done . It is what the fanatical free-silver Democrats propose shall be done at Chicago . If it be done , what will be the consequence ? In our judgment  --  and we have given definite facts to sustain it  --  the result will be overwhelming defeat . The Democratic Party with a free-silver platform would be opposed , first and necessarily , by all Republicans except ' the free-silver men ; second , by all Democrats - who believe that free silver would bring ruin to business ; third , by all bimetallists who believe that international bimetallism is possible and that American free silver would defeat it . deleted 2 lines very loyal Democrat . No one , we believe , ' disputes that . He is a. sincere bimetallist-He believes that bimetallism by international agreement would be a great gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With him as to his view of the possinillties . Our information on that point may lead us to Very different conclusions . But his very hopefulness in this direction springs from his zeal for bimetallism , and emphasizes hisauthority . As a bimetallist he concurs in the opinion of European bimetallists " that free coinage undertaken by the United States alone would simply eed in silver monometallism and discredit and put back the cause of the double standard the world over . " As a Democrat , very eager for Democratic victory , he is even more plain . He says : " Most any sacrifice might be asked of Democrats for the sake of the party , and they would cheerfully make it . But , if the delegates from this locality should go to that convention and represent that the rank and file of the party would follow the lead of our Southern brethren and vote for the free coinage of silver by the United States alone , they would be misrepresenting the state of public opinion here . Whether it is so or not , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the same feeling of indisposition to compromise with that matter for votes or anything else is as active and dominant here in our party as it was found in the Republican Party when it bore down and overpowered the McKinley machine . " Personally , it is my opinion , if the Democratic Party goes on to that platform at this time , it will meet the most disastrous defeat that any party has ever had in this country . I understand it is honestly believed in , and people think it will bring relief from their present troubles ; but between now and election day it will be pretty thoroughly sifted , and the people of this country- will not face the disturbance of values , the loss of confidence , the general distress and ruin which would come to their business interests in such a change in their standard of value as would arise from such action . And it will , In my opinion , overwhelm the persons who undertake it . " This , then , is the choice : 1 . The free-silver issue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard until changed by general international agreement , with the certainty that the fight will then be on McKinleyism , and a chance for victory .
