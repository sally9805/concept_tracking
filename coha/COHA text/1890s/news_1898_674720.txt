txt Once more there is a revival of the proposition to remove the United States Mint from Philadelphia to this city . At various times during the past century there have been attacks upon the policy that maintains the mint in the city which was once the capital of the Republic . For obvious reasons , chiefly those relating to the expense of a removal , the project has never been authorized by Congress . And yet a moment 's consideration shows that the present situation of the chief mint of the United States is incongruous and illogical . It is in Philadelphia because it was casually left there when the seat of the National Government was removed from that city . If the principal mint of the country should be situated in its principal commercial city- , then the establishment would be in New York . If the mint should be . at the National capital , then Washington would have it along with the other institutions and establishments that form so considerable a material interest in that city . Certainly nothing in the commerce of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will warrant a retention of the mint at Philadelphia . The history of the decline of The Mint to a mint is peculiar . It was the policy of the successive Directors of the minting establishment in Philadelphia to maintain the pleasing fiction that their institution was the parent of any others that might be brought into the world . To assist in this illusion all others were officially known as branch mints ; that in Philadelphia was referred to in all official documents as the parent mint . As the development of gold and silver mining in the Far Western States made more and more onerous the cost of transportation to the bullion producers of those regions it was insisted that assay offices should be established at points nearer the sources of production . This was reluctantly granted , and a mint and an assay office were authorized to be built in San Francisco . Later the same favors were granted to Carson City , Nevada , and assay offices were allowed to Boise City , Idaho ; Denver , Col. ; Deadwood , S. D. , and Helena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed all these innovations as they came up , one after the other , in the course of years . When it was proposed to authorize a mint and assay office for Carson City , he made an elaborate argument against the proposition , his main contention being that as the right to coin money was one of the sovereign rights of the National Government , any distribution of minting establishments through the country would be sure to result in the disintegration of National dignity and power . Senator NESMITH of Oregon , in a brief and humorous speech , exposed the fallaciousness of this reasoning , and the nickname that he applied to the author of the argument , " Disintegration PotLOCK , " adhered to that official for a long time thereafter . As a direct result of that and similar reductions of the exclusive importance of the mint at Philadelphia , the adjectives " parent " and " branch , " as applied to the various minting establishments of the United States ; have finally been dropped , and each of these is a mint in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer any reason why the original United States Mint at Philadelphia should remain where it is , none why it should retain an Importance greater than that of any other similar establishment except that importance which naturally attaches to an institution of traditional interest . San Francisco , the chief commercial city of the Pacific Coast , has a Sub-Treasury , mint , and assay office . New York , the chief commercial city of the Atlantic Coast , should surely have all these institutions , where they are most readily available to the vast commercial interests that centre here . New York does not need a mint to add to its importance . That importance has already assured itself , and the establishment of a SubTreasury and an assay office of the United States is merely a natural part of the city 's development . The delay and consequent cost of fetching and carrying between New York and the Philadelphia Mint would be obviated by building a mint here . It would be a matter of indifference to us whether the Philadelphia Mint were maintained or abandoned .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
