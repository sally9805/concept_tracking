According to Belasco 's own account , The Girl I Left Behind Me was written at the request of Charles Frohman to serve as an opening piece for the new Empire Theatre . Belasco told Frohman nothing of the play 's theme , " because I had made up my mind to try to bring on the American stage a phase of American life , on our Western frontiers , involving the American Indian , in a new way ; I did n't want discussion and I dreaded discouragement . At that time , early in 1892 , the Indian troubles in the West were much in the public mind . The fierce insurrections of 1876 , under the leadership of Sitting Bull , Crazy Horse , Spotted Tail , and others , and the lamentable slaughter of the gallant Custer and his intrepid followers in the terrible battle at the Little Bighorn ( June 25 , that year ) , had not been forgotten . " Working in collaboration with Franklin Fyles , at that time dramatic critic of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of American Indian and military plays . As has been pointed out by critics , most of the situations in the play were not new , but they were masterfully employed , and the technique of staging was sensationally effective . The keynote of the play was suspense , and it was suspense par excellence that Belasco 's maturing art achieved in its production . PROPERTY PLOT Act I : Nine carbines . Sabres and suits for supers .

Some redskins sneaked into Wilber 's place last night , and this morning there was n't a four-legged thing left  --  except a sawbuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sun dance , and of course we had to go and stop that . Ken . General Kennion What appears to be the effect of the order prohibiting the Indian 's dances ? Bur . Dick Burleigh They do n't like it . Ladru  --  or Scar Brow , as they call him here , got back today and sent a runner to meet me , with some infernal nonsense about grievances . Ken . General Kennion Major , they should be heard . Bur . Dick Burleigh Dryly Oh , you 'll hear them soon enough . I took the liberty of promising him an interview with you , and sent Andy to bring him in . Andy Jackson is heard calling , off R. , as if from a distance Andy . Andy Jackson Hello ! Hello , major ! Major Burleigh . Bur . Dick Burleigh That 's Andy now .

Ladru is a full-blooded Indian , about fifty years of age , large and powerful in physique , and magnetic in speech and manner . His costume is a picturesque combination of that of the Indian and white men of the region . Fell-an-Ox and Silent Tongue are dressed as chiefs of Blackfoot tribes Ken . General Kennion Apart to Burleigh , as Ladru enters Is that Scar Brow ? Bur . Dick Burleigh Introducing him John Ladru  --  General Kennion . Ken .

Fawn Afraid Looks up into Ladru 's face and holds up six fingers It is six moons since Scar Brow gladdened his Fawn 's eyes by looking into them . Ladru . John Ladru But they have lighted his trail through every hour of his absence . Lifts her hair to his lips , kisses it and then smoothes it caressingly . He does not kiss her face Bur . Dick Burleigh Apart from Kennion They say the only soft spot in the fellow is his love for this girl . Ladru . John Ladru To Kennion Pardon me . I neglect my errand . Kate .

Sees the Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Kennion To Ladru If I had been away from my daughter Draws Kate to him I should forget everything , except that I held her in my arms again . There must be a characteristic contrast between the two fathers in expressing love for their daughters , one indicating the savagery of his nature and the other a dignity of culture Ladru . John Ladru Turning his eyes upon Kate My people talk of the general 's daughter , and I see that she is his pride . Ken . General Kennion Not emphatically , but in mere acknowledgement of Ladru 's compliment She is very dear to me . Dix enters with two large skins and spreads them on the ground . Kennion motions the Indians to be seated . Fell-an-Ox and Silent Tongue sit on ground , R. ; Arthur , on front end of steps , with a notebook , which he uses occasionally ; Morton on other end of steps . Andy stands in background Lucy .

In comic alarm , as they chance to turn their faces toward her Wooh ! Exit quickly , following Kate into house . Ladru sits , R.C. , and Kennion , L.C. The men on ground are now in a semicircle . At this moment McGlynn enters with a pipe of peace , already lighted . Burleigh takes pipe , passes it , stem foremost to Ladru , and sits on lower step . McGlynn sits on steps of wagon . Ladru takes one deliberate whiff , and passes pipe to Kennion , who , after a single puff , passes it to Fell-an-Ox and he , after smoking , gives it to Silent Tongue , who lays it down after using it . The ceremony is performed in silence , impressively , but not slowly . The red glow of the setting sun falls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers are scattering our braves at the sun dance . Ken . General Kennion The government believes that these dances breed mischief . Ladru . John Ladru They are the ceremonies of our religion . Arthur writes quietly in his book Ken . General Kennion Your education , Ladru , should free you from these old superstitions . Ladru . John Ladru The good priest taught me much , but he did not make me forget the wrongs of my people . Meaningly as he looks at Kennion nor what I myself have suffered . Bur . Dick Burleigh Our government provides liberally for you . Ladru . John Ladru Addressing Kennion Since last winter 's cold and hunger , the rations have grown smaller and poorer , and last month there was no food at all . Bur . Dick Burleigh Brusquely Silent Tongue 's men seemed ready enough yesterday to help themselves . Ken . General Kennion Let us listen , major . Ladru . John Ladru Ignoring Burleigh When Silent Tongue 's men take the cattle to feed their hungry women and children Turns to Burleigh you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the next snow may fall upon their graves . Arthur writes . Turns to Kennion General , I did not come to speak of these things , but to ask you to keep your soldiers from interfering with our worship . Ken . General Kennion The military has no option . Ladru . John Ladru You are Christians , because you choose to be , but you deny to us the sacred rites handed down from our fathers . Pointing to Fell-an-Ox and Silent Tongue These are human beings . Raise your voice for them . Ken . General Kennion I am powerless . Enter Fawn Afraid , R.U.E. , leading Edgar , who good-humoredly submits . Fawn expresses in pantomime her proud intention of showing him to Ladru . She pauses on hearing her father 's voice Ladru . John Ladru Then if we begin our great annual sun dance tomorrow , you will stop it ? Ken . General Kennion Firmly The order is imperative . Ladru . John Ladru Rising and speaking with vehement protest This is monstrous . With intense feeling You have taken from us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no God ? Ken . General Kennion Rises I must enforce the policy dictated from Washington . Ladru . John Ladru Stooping and taking up handfuls of dust Then let the Great Spirit witness , I hurl defiance . Fell-an-Ox and Silent Tongue , who have sat stoically , leap to their feet . All start up . Before Ladru can hurl the dust , Fawn arrests his hands Fawn . Fawn Afraid No , no . We must not hate them . Ladru . John Ladru Lets the dust fall from his hands , and points to Fell-an-Ox and Silent Tongue to go . Exeunt Fell-an-Ox and Silent Tongue , R.1.E . Come with me , Fawn , to our people . Fawn exit with Ladru , R.1.E. , looking back at Edgar with an expression of dread Bur . Dick Burleigh His vicious look at you , general , when he referred to a grief of his own , gave me a chill . Have you ever met ? Ken . General Kennion Who has stood looking after Ladru Yes  --  in the Blue Lake expedition of ' 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocities . In an attack on an Indian village , we met with desperate resistance . The young brave who had led them in their raids dashed upon me . We struggled together until a cut from my sabre across his forehead laid him senseless . Bur . Dick Burleigh Quickly Then it was you who gave him that scar ? Ken . General Kennion Yes , and it is unfortunate that he should come to me at a time when his influence may cause or prevent trouble . McGlynn picks up the pipe and exit to house . Dix gathers up the skins and exit above house Bur . Dick Burleigh Oh , there 'll be no difficulty , if we sweep down on their dance in the morning . A little scrimmage might show them we 're not fooling . Enter Dick Burleigh , running , L.U.E. He is nine years old , dressed in the uniform of the Poughkeepsie military school , with leggings added . A game bag is slung across his shoulder , and he carries a small rifle Dick .

General Kennion To Edgar Let there be no more severity than is absolutely necessary . Bur . Dick Burleigh Casually , yet distinctly You 'll find a wire at Lumber Camp if you wish to let us know anything . Ed . Lieutenant Edgar Hawkesworth I will take men and horses that were not out today , and make it a brisk gallop . I promise you , Morton , to get you back in time for the ball . Edgar speaks apart to Andy . Exit Andy , L.U.E. Dick . Dick Burleigh Coming forward with enthusiasm Say , pop , I 'm going along . There 'll be great fun chasing Indians , and I do n't want to get left . Bur . Dick Burleigh You 've chased enough today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick salutes Kennion .

Playfully turning him over and spanking him Ken . General Kennion Major , let there be no more severity than is actually necessary . Bur .

Fondling the cap , he sees a small band of crepe on it and is deeply moved God knows , I once lost the thing that filled up my heart . For an instant , he holds his cigar in his trembling fingers , and then sinks down on a seat , R. , covering his face with his hands . Parlow shows uneasiness at Burleigh 's last words Ed . Lieutenant Edgar Hawkesworth To Morton The crepe on the boy 's cap recalls the old affair . Burleigh quickly pulls himself together , rises and hands cap to Kennion . Unable to speak , he requests by a gesture that it be sent to Dick ; then bites the end off a fresh cigar viciously , to conceal his feelings , lights it by the stump of the one he has been smoking Bur . Dick Burleigh With no show of apology I 'll be back in a minute . Exit abruptly , R.U.E. Ken . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way like this before ? Ed . Lieutenant Edgar Hawkesworth Not since that morning he returned from Crook 's January raid and found in his wife 's room only the boy asleep . His grief was terrible , general . Thrown on the bed was the gown she had worn at the garrison dance . The flowers from her hair , the slippers from her feet  --  lay where she had hastily flung them and a note  --  read at a glance  --  told him of the dishonor of her flight . General goes up , crosses to R. Feelingly placing hand on Morton 's shoulder Ah , Morton , if you had seen his heart break ! Mort . Lieutenant Morton Parlow Who has crossed to R. and stands looking after Burleigh I was away on detached duty at Cheyenne River ; and then I went East on furlough  --  to see Kate , you remember ?

Was no clue to his identity found ? No letters  --  no  --  anything ? Ed . Li eutenant Edgar Hawkesworth Evidence was obtained that he was an army officer . Ken . General Kennion Abruptly turning Morton  --  Mort . Lieutenant Morton Parlow Startled by the sudden utterance of his name Ah ! Supports himself against wagon Ken .

It will be hard to leave the old troop  --  the boys and you  --  but  --  Struggling to keep from breaking down What can a fellow do but go , when  --  You saw our major . Points to stump on which Burleigh sat Only the sight of a band of mourning crushed him with memories . Forgetting himself But , before my eyes are  --  that 's what is driving me away .

The chill and weariness of the night were on me  --  with the gray promise of morning lifting none of the darkness or cold that had settled into my very soul . The relief guard brought me a letter .

Kate Kennion Places the bag over his shoulder and speaks under her breath danger hanging over the Post . Picture ACT III . " IN THE MIDST OF LIFE WE ARE IN DEATH " Scene : The stockade at Post Kennion . The enclosure is built in accordance with military usage , as described in article on " Fortification " in the Encyclopaedia Britannica . The stockade is formed of a row of strong palisades , pointed at the top , from nine to twelve inches in diameter , fixed deeply in the ground , with intervals of three inches between the palisades . These intervals are filled by smaller palisades , cut square at the top , every alternate palisade being shortened four and a half inches , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A stout riband nailed horizontally to the upper ends of the palisades strengthens the construction . Along the palisades extends a banquette or embankment , high enough to enable persons when standing on it to look out through the loopholes . At L. is the barrack building . The front corner is partially burned . Several extinguished incendiary arrows are sticking in the wood . A long ladder is against building , and three or four water buckets marked " U.S. " are beside it . Three windows in second story , two facing R. and one facing audience . One window in first story faces audience and one , near corner , faces R. The windows have closed wooden shutters . A door , L.U.E. , with a small roof supported by posts . At R. are massive wooden gates , swung on large posts , and heavily barred and bolted . A parapet , R.C. , large enough to hold several persons , if reached by steps . The ground outside is supposed to slope away . Beyond the stockade on all sides , nothing but sky is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L. , has nearly burned out . The scene presents an aspect of grim picturesqueness . Time : Dawn of the Fourth of Judy , 1890 . Music : Sixteen bars of awe-impressive music are played ; then a pause of dead silence , after which the curtain rises on the following tableau . Discovered : Kennion stands , L.C. , his back to audience , and his eyes fixed on Andy who is crouched on the parapet , R.C. , peering through loophole . Kate stands R. of Kennion , clasped in his arms facing audience , listening breathlessly . Burleigh is seated on camp stool , near corner of building , L. , writing on a small cross-legged table , on which are pen , ink , and paper . McGlynn stands , L. of him , holding up a lighted lantern .

A trooper 's Wife sits on the ground near rear corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Boy and Girl asleep at her side on an army blanket . Jones is watching at loophole near gate , R. The cut he received in Act II is covered by a piece of plaster . A Trooper at back is looking off , L. , through loophole . Dix , with his head bandaged and bloodstained , stands with a group of six Troopers , C. , facing Kennion , carbines in hand as though awaiting orders . Their faces and clothes show the effects of a night of desperate fighting . All who appeared in Act II still wear the costumes of the ball , producing an effect of contrast between their gay attire and their present plights . The light is gray and misty , as though the darkness were giving way to the dawn of day . Note : The voices of the people in this act are modulated in keeping with the awful suspense and danger hanging over them . Bur . Dick Burleigh Lays down pen , blots page and reads by light of lantern unheard by the others " Daylight , July 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by overwhelming numbers . Since my last entry we have withstood a fierce attempt to destroy the Post by fire .

Unless Lieutenant Hawkesworth has reached the Fort and soon brings relief we are beyondmdash ; human  --  help . " A pause . McGlynn puts out lantern and exit , L.U.E.

At this instant , Edgar rises , turns L. , and the two men stand facing each other in the moonlight Ed . Lieuten ant Edgar Hawkesworth For a second fails to recognize Burleigh in the dim light . Extending his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant . In the dark I thought you were Parlow . Exit , L.2.E. , to library Ed . Lieutenant Edgar Hawkesworth Goes to window , R. , leans his back against open door for support , his face turned towards the Fort , and listens to the distant voices .

Music stops . Enter Lucy , L.U.E. , looking for bridal veil Lucy . Lucy Hawkesworth Oh , dear , where did I put that wedding veil ?

Speaking quietly but gradually rising to great intensity The general knows there was cowardice at North Pass . Ed . Lieutenant Edgar Hawkesworth Starts Ah ! Kate . Kate Kennion Was Lieutenant Parlow the guilty man ? Edgar is dumbfounded , but checks himself and is silent As I suspected , you are shielding him . As the conviction of Morton 's dastardly lie is forced upon her by Edgar 's continued silence , she cries out in horror Oh ! Turns to Edgar You are silent because I am his promised wife , and you are his friend . Ed . Lieutenant Edgar Hawkesworth You were right  --  when you said  --  " On it depends more than a life  --  asoldier 's honor . " Rising I will tell General Kennion he is mistaken .

Lieutenant Morton Parlow He wants you to believe he did for me what you know I did for him . There 's only one explanation . He loves Kate . Ken . General Kennion Surprised , looks hard at Edgar He loves Kate ? Mort . Lieutenant Morton Parlow He wo n't deny that .

In the presence of the boy , Kennion releases Burleigh 's hand Dick . Dick Burleigh Pop , I 've been wanting to see you . Putting his free arm around Burleigh 's neck I promise I 'll never run off again without first reporting to you .
