txt It clearly appeared in Judge Barrett 's court yesterday that a citizen had made his way into the jury box by concealing facts the avowal of which would have secured his prompt rejection . He concealed the fact that he had been subjected to a severe cross-examination by one of the counsel for the prosecution ; he concealed an association with the prisoner as a member of the same lodge ; and he concealed his relations with one of the complaining witnesses . When these facts were brought out , the Man was promptly put off the jury . Judge Barrett , with just indignation , declared that his concealment must have been made with some ulterior purpose . The man was anxious to fill a place Which the ordinary citizen is only too prone to shirk , and Is always glad to have an excuse for not taking . This man had ample excuses and did not produce them . What his " ulterior purpose " was we may infer from the fact that the counsel for the defense was exceedingly anxious to keep him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inference must be that he had smuggled himself into the jury for the purpose of taking part in a verdict , or of preventing a ' verdict , without regard to the testimony . And yet it seeps that no Penalty attaches to this offense except of being left off the jury if one is caught at it . If there were any penalty provided we may be sure that Judge Barrett would have taken steps to enforce it in Durando 's case . A penalty certainly ought to be provided by law for a crime which aims to pollute the sources of justice .
