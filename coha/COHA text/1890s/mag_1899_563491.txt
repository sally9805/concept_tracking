txt THE Peace Conference , called by the generous invitation of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia , has provoked most divergent opinions as to its aim and as to its definite result .. Two opinions are particularly prominent : on the one hand , the opinion of Utopians ; on the other hand , the opinion of practical statesmen . The Utopians , the most dangerous enemies of the progress of international law , expected from this Conference a general disarmament of all the Powers , eternal peace and the abolition of war . Practical statesmen , on the contrary , were convinced that this Conference would be productive of no practical result whatever , since the purpose pursued was too lofty , too complicated , and beyond the limits of the real life of states . It seems to me that neither of these opinions is in accord with the fundamental idea which brought about the meeting of this Conference .

In other words , the Conference at The hague could either propose the limitation of armed forces , with a view to securing arbitration as the most practical means of regulating international conflicts , or it could propose arbitration , in the first place , and leave the solution of the larger question of disarmament to the future . In the first case , the effort would be through disarmament to reach arbitration as the legal means for regulating international conflicts ; in the second case , by proclaiming arbitration first , disarmament , perhaps in the distant future , might be reached . That was the alternative submitted to the Conference at The Hague : and the Conference chose the second way . That is to say , it studied international arbitration as the regular means for adjusting conflicts between nations , reserving for the future the question of the limitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Conference it was decided that three great problems should be examined : ( 1 . ) The question of disarmament . ( 2 . ) The declaration of Brussels ( 1874 ) concerning the laws and customs of war , and the application of the Convention of Geneva ( 1864 ) to naval warfare . ( 3 . ) The question of peaceful means of regulating conflicts between nations ; friendly offices , mediation and arbitration . The Conference appointed three different commissions to study these three problems . The first commission , whose task it was to examine the question of the limitation of armed forces , was under the presidency of M. Beernaert , the eminent Belgian statesman . The second commission , which was to examine the declaration of Brussels ( 1874 ) , and the Red Cross in time of naval war , was under the presidency of the author of this article . // The third commission , charged with the examination of the question of arbitration , had for its president M. L6on Bourgeois , first Plenipotentiary of France . These three commissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jnly . The first commission demonstrated , by its labors and its very serious discussions , that the time had not yet come for limiting the military forces of the nations on land and sea by an international compact , and that this question should be left to the future , which must needs give attention to it . The first commission , in the name of all the members of the Conference , formulated two resolutions , which bear excellent testimony that the question of limitation of armaments , as raised by Russia , was unanimously considered to be a question of the day , a subject for serious examination and careful reflection , but that the time has not come to solve it . The second commission accomplished its task in full . It revised the declaration of Brussels ( 1874 ) concerning the laws and customs of war on land , and the whole Conference expressed its approbation of the project of a new Convention . The ten articles , also , concerning the Red Cross in time of naval war were adopted by the Conference and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powers . The third commission , whose task it was to examine all questions concerning friendly offices , mediation and arbitration , drew up a document of fifty-six articles , which presents a complete r*sum6 of all questions in reference to arbitration as a legal and regular means of adjusting conflicts between nations . Without a doubt , this agreement concerning international arbitration is an eminently practical result . It gives to those Powers which seriously desire to avoid war between nations a means of attaining that object by the method devised for them by the Conference at The Hague . I. In conformity with the message of the Emperor of Russia , by which the states were invited to unite their efforts towards the maintenance of a general peace , the Powers represented at the Conference at The Hague were to investigate all the means whereby this exalted object might be attained . To give a fair idea of the way in which the Conference at // The Hague decided to enter upon the solution of the question raised by Russia , it is necessary to present , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conference , so far as concerns international arbitration . Since it was Russia that called the Conference , it was natural that she should also suggest a basis for the discussions . In the sessions of the Conference of 1lay 26th , in the name of the Imperial Government , the Russian delegation communicated to the Conference a draft of an agreement in regard to friendly offices , mediation , international commissions of inquiry and arbitration . The plan of the Russian delegation comprised fifty-two articles . It did not constitute a definite agreement , but presented " the elements " of such an agreement . At the same session the first Plenipotentiary of England , Sir Julian Pauncefote , in a remarkable m4moire , squarely proposed the question of the creation of a permanent tribunal of arbitration . The delegation from the United States of America submitted a similar proposition , expressing the desire that arbitration might become a normal method of settling international conflicts . In examining these propositions , all the members of the Conference must have been convinced that there was absolutely no fundamental difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were permeated by the same ideas upon the one point relating to the permanent court of arbitration ; they had the same object in view and indicated the same way to the attainment of this object . But , since the Russian propositions were presented in the name of the Government which had taken the initial steps towards this Conference , and since these propositions made up a complete ensemble in the form of a document of fifty-two articles , it was most natural for the Conference to decide that they should serve as a basis for discussion . On the other hand , an examination of these different propositions by a gathering of more than a hundred delegates from the Powers was evidently impracticable . For this reason the third commission decided to nominate a committee , composed of a few members only , and these the most competent in such matters , for the purpose of amalgamating the different propositions that had been made , and of preparing for the commission and for the Conference a complete report on all the questions referring to international arbitration . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third commission was concentrated , the different propositions made were submitted to a most conscientious examination . The draft of agreement , elaborated by this committee of investigation , was presented to the third commission at a full meeting , and later on to the Conference itself . M. le Chevalier Decamp presented the report of the committee of investigation and of the third commission , which was unanimously approved by the Conference at The Hague . Before entering upon the examination of the arbitration convention adopted by the Conference at The Hague , it will be useful to explain in a few words the purpose and object of the propositions made by the Government of Russia , which were adopted as a basis for the labors of the Commission . These Russian propositions comprised four different parts . In the first place , their object was to regulate the question of friendly offices and mediation . The fundamental idea of this chapter on friendly offices and mediation was this : the Powers represented at the Conference at The Hague are to recognize the moral and practical necessity of not resorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither friendly offices nor mediation nor arbitration could settle the difficulty . According to the first article of the Russian project , it was said " that for the purpose of preventing resort to force as far as possible in international affairs , the signatory Powers agree to direct all their efforts towards bringing about , by peaceful means , the adjustment of conflicts which may arise between them . " From this point of view , in case of grave differences or of conflict , " before appealing to arms , the signatory Powers should have recourse , as far as circumstances permit , to the friendly offices or mediation of one or more friendly Powers . " In a case where the situation of Powers in conflict does not allow them to agree upon the choice of a mediating Power , neutral Powers may offer mediation of their own accord . So far as concerns arbitration the Russian propositions , as was also the case with the question of friendly offices and mediation , maintained an attitude of due respect for the national sovereignty of states . Russia proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in the first place , in questions concerning the interpretation and application of treaties in force . The Powers in conflict are to be entirely free to resort to arbitration , to establish tribunals of arbitration in all questions in which " neither national interests nor national honor " are involved . These principles of voluntary , spontaneous arbitration were not violated by the tenth and eleventh articles of the Russian propositions , in virtue of which arbitration was recognized as obligatory in some exceptional cases . In order that arbitration might become a regular means , organized to meet the requirements of conflicts between nations , Russia proposed the creation of a permanent tribunal of arbitration , during the session of May 26th . It was not the object of this tribunal of international arbitration in any way to interfere with the full liberty of Governments , in cases where these Governments desired to create special tribunals . In order that these permanent or special tribunals of arbitration might act according to the same rules of procedure , the Government of Russia proposed a code of arbitration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the practice of several recent tribunals of arbitration . It should be added that this code of arbitration was proposed by the author of this article to the international tribunal of arbitration which met at Paris to adjust the conflict between Great Britain and the United States of Venezuela , of which the author of this article was president , and it was imposed by that tribunal upon the two Powers in litigation as an obligatory regulation . The Russian propositions also contained a chapter which produced considerable misunderstanding and discussion at the Conference at The Hague a little later on . It was the chapter on In .. ternational Commissions of Inquiry . The object of these International Commissions of Inquiry is to prevent the development of a conflict between nations by an examination in loco of the circumstances which brought about the conflict . These Commissions of Inquiry may be considered as a sort of safety-valve , designed to set bounds to the discussions of the press , of the pul ) lic and of representative bodies . Such were the propositions submitted by Russia to the Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third commission . vot. ctxmx. - io. 516. 39 // II . Without going into the details of all the discussions which took place at the Conference at The Hague in reference to arbitration , it seems necessary to give a brief summary of the definite results obtained . After very conscientious work on the part of the Committee of Investigation and of the third commission , the Conference at The Hague finally approved of the plan of agreement for the peaceful adjustment of international conflicts presented to it by the third commission . I consider it useful to give a general survey of the substance of that agreement , bringing out only such stipulations as aroused difficulties or more or less heated discussions . The work of the Conference , so far as international arbitration is concerned , consists of an agreement of sixty-one articles , which agreement has at the present date been signed by fifteen Powers ; and which will be definitively approved , it is to be hoped , by all the Powers represented at the Conference at The Hague . Let us summarize this agreement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first chapter , the object of which is to regulate friendly offices and mediation as means of giving a peaceful solution to international conflicts . The principles adopted by the Conference concerning friendly offices and mediation emphasize the moral duty , so to speak , of the signatory Powers to resort , so far as circumstances permit , to the friendly offices or to the mediation of one or more of the Powers . Like the Russian project , the Conference at The Hague directs that Powers not involved in the conflict may offer , of their own free will , their friendly offices and their mediation to the states in litigation . It is recognized , also , that the right to offer friendly offices or mediation belongs to the states not involved in the quarrel , even during the course of hostilities . The exercise of this right shall never be considered as an unfriendly act by either of the parties in litigation . What constitutes the rOle of a mediator ? The mediator ought to reconcile opposing claims , pacify resentment , and frame a compromise for Powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with international practice it may be confidently said that the difference between them and the practice in these matters , is not very great . For a long time , // especially since the Congress of Paris ( 1856 ) , the Powers have declared it to be a duty , in case of conflict , to have recourse to friendly offices and mediation . Yet it must not be forgotten that the stipulations of the Treaty of Paris ( 1856 ) had in view only certain particular cases , especially the entanglements within the domain of the Eastern Question ; neither friendly offices nor mediation had been enunciated as general and normal means to avoid conflicts between nations . It is only at the Conference at The Hague that this general and almost morally obligatory character of friendly offices and mediation was recognized , for the first time , by all the Powers represented at the Conference . There is another point in which the Convention of The hague is fundamentally distinguished from other international stipulations on that subject . To the United States of America and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs the honor of having extended the very narrow limits within which mediation has been hitherto practised . On motion of the representative of the United States of America , Mr. Holls , the Conference at The Hague adopted in the eighth article a " special mediation " in the following form : " In case of grave differences endangering peace , the states In eonflict may respectively choose a Power to which they may Intrust the mission of entering into direct communication with the Power chosen by the other side for the purpose of preventing the rupture of pacific relations . " During the existence of this mandate , the term of which , unless otherwise ordered , shall not exceed thirty days , the states In litigation shall cease from all direct communication on the subject of the conflict , which shall be considered as submitted exclusively to the mediating Powers . These shall direct all their efforts towards adjusting the difficulty . " In case of an actual interruption of pacific relations , these Powers shall remain charged with the common mission of profiting by every opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediation , " as well explained by its author at the meeting of the Committee of Investigation , is the same as the idea of a duel between individuals : in the same manner as , upon the eve of an encounter regarded as fatal , instead of leaving the quarrel open to the principals , it is preferable to yield the discussion of controverted points for the moment to witnesses or seconds , possessing respectively the confidence of each party and less subject to the sway of passion . ' " Special // mediation " on the part of such witnesses or seconds affords the great advantage of avoiding the necessity of a perfect understanding , so difficult in the choice of a single or common mediator . Conformably to this " special mediation , " the Powers in conflict must cease from all direct communication with each other in reference to the object in dispute , and leave it to the witnesses or seconds to enter into direct communication one with the other , to investigate the circumstances under which the quarrel came about and to propose to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two mediators . These mediators are not , properly speaking , arbitrators ; they are Powers , which , for the sake of peace and friendly relations among nations , take it upon themselves to clear away misunderstandings which menace the peace of the world . Finally , in regard to this chapter on mediation , it should be noted that the acceptance of such mediation shall not have the effect , unless otherwise prescribed , of interrupting , retarding or impeding mobilization and other measures preparatory to war . The second subject under consideration at the Conference at The Hague was the question of International Commissions of Inquiry . The author of this essay was enabled to explain to the Conference at The Hague the practical value of this proposition . He recalled cases-like that of Schnoebeh*-where a quarrel arises between two states , in connection with some frontier incident , or with a criminal act , such as the blowing up of the American warship , the " Maine , " in the port of Havana . The facts relative to frontier incidents are not always clear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on this side of the frontier or on that ; it is doubtful upon which authorities the blame should be placed in cases of violation of territorial sovereignty of neighboring states . In such cases public opinion becomes heated , the more so since such an incident is usually unexpected ; public opinion is ill-informed ; it does not know the origin and the true causes of the conflict ; it is at the mercy of the impressions of the moment ; the chances are much in favor of such ignorance acting as an irritant upon the spirit of the two contesting nations ; and thus the conflict may become a reason for breaking off diplomatic relations and even a cause of war . In such cases it is absolutely necessary that the truth in // reference to the causes of the incident should be known ; and for this purpose it becomes the duty of the Powers , between whom the difficulty has arisen , to send to the spot a commission composed of members chosen by the two parties . This commission should have but one object : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governments interested . It rests with these Governments to take further steps after considering the report . From this point of view , International Commissions of Inquiry are not innovations , for the Powers have availed themselves of them on various occasions , for example in the Orient ; but for such Commissions of Inquiry a stable and legitimate organization should be secured . These propositions met with a very sympathetic reception at the hands of the Committee of Investigation and of the Conference at The hague , although there was some misunderstanding as to the method of procedure , and even as to the objects of these Commissions of Inquiry . It was said-especially did the representatives of the small states of the Balkan Peninsula , IRoumania , Servia , Bulgaria and Greece , raise the bbjection-that these Commissions of Inquiry would have but one object , namely , to attack the sovereignty of these small states ; that the great Powers would be constantly imposing these Commissions of Inquiry upon them ; that the results obtained by the Commissions of Inquiry would always be unfavorable to the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , it was said that these Commissions of Inquiry would be , so to speak , arbitration , since the report which they would present would amount to a decree of arbitration . The delegation from Russia sought to prove that these Commissions of Inquiry would be of enormous importance to the smaller Powers especially ; for to the small Powers the right would be given , in all cases of conflict , to demand that such Commissions of Inquiry should be instituted . A great Power could always utilize its strength and the means at its disposition to take such measures as seemed necessary from the incipiency of the conflict ; but if the great Powers were under moral obligation to establish Commissions of Inquiry before taking such steps , a guarantee would be given to the small Powers , which they do not now possess . On the other hand , the report of such a Commission has not // the character of a judgment by arbitration ; the Powers in litigation , which have established such a Commission , would , nevertheless , remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they saw fit ; the object of the Commissioners is not to judge of the affair , but simply to present the results of a conscientious study of the circumstances under which the quarrel arose . These considerations met with unanimous acceptance on the part of the members of the Conference , in which acceptance the delegates of the small states of the Balkan Peninsula joined ; and in its Articles of Agreement the Conference at The Hague adopted the Russian proposition , with a few changes which in no wise alter the practical character of this new international institution . According to the original propositions , the Russian propositions , the Powers are under obligation to institute such Commissions . At the request of the small Powers , the Conference at The Hague changed this obligatory form of the sentence in such a way as to read that the signatory Powers " consider it useful " that parties which have been unable to agree by the diplomatic way , shall , " as far as circumstances permit , " institute an International Commission of Inquiry , whose task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing out the facts of the case , by means of an impartial and careful investigation . The Commissions of Inquiry shall be instituted by the Powers in litigation , who shall name two members of this Commission ; a neutral Power may be invited to nominate the president of the Commission , who , by his vote , shall give the final solution to the questions raised . These Commissions of Inquiry should proceed according to the rules adopted in all cases of investigation-that is to say , by hearing testimony on both sides . After the Commission has finished its investigation with the assistance of the Powers in litigation , it shall render a report to the parties who made the appointments . " The report is limited to a statement of fact and is not in the nature of a decree of arbitration . " We now pass on to the examination of the decisions of the Conference at The Hague as to arbitration itself . The general principles by which the Conference at The Hague was guided are as follows : International arbitration is recognized and legalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise between two states on questions of a judiciary order , and , in the first place , on questions of interpretation or application of international treaties or agreements . The signatory Powers have recognized this as the most efficacious and at the same time the most equitable means of adjusting international difficulties . All the Powers , even those which have signed the treaty , remain free to conclude special treaties for developing international arbitration as the most just and equitable means of regulating conflicts between them . Under these conditions the sovereignty of even the signatory Powers was respected in every way by the Conference at The Hague . But , as we said above , these general principles differ on one point from the original propositions made by Russia . In the Russian propositions , arbitration was recommended in two forms : optional arbitration and obligatory arbitration . Optional arbitration depends entirely on the good will of the Powers ; obligatory arbitration was recommended by Russia for some special cases which are at present more or less provided for by different international treaties . Russia proposed to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration in cases of differences having reference to pecuniary damages sustained by a state or the territory under its jurisdiction as a consequence of illicit action or of negligence on the part of another state or the territory under its jurisdiction ; in cases of disagreements referring to the application of postal , telegraph or railroad treaties ; of disagreements referring to the protection of literary , artistic or industrial property , to treaties on successions , etc . In such cases , according to the Russian proposition , the signatory Powers would have been obliged to resort to arbitration , and this obligation should have been confirmed by the Conference at The Hague . At the beginning of the labors of the Conference at The Hague , the idea of obligatory arbitration met with a sympathetic reception , and was generally approved and considered to be the first step along the way already entered by several Powers by means of special treaties . But Germany thought it necessary to oppose the proposition energetically , and the Conference at The Hague , influenced by the spirit of conciliation and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea : obligatory arbitration . was completely set aside by the Conference . Having approved of the general principles of arbitration , the Conference had to place itself on record as regards the Russian , English and American proposition concerning a. permanent tribunal of arbitration . The idea of a permanent tribunal of arbitration is not new ; all the advocates and friends of arbitration , as a pacific means of avoiding conflict between nations , have always had in mind the necessity of organizing arbitration as a universal and judiciary procedure for cases of litigation between nations . In the session of May 26th , Russia had expressed this idea in its principles . But the honor of having put the question in a categorical and detailed manner belongs to the first delegate of England , Sir Julian Pauncefote , who submitted to the Conference a project for instituting a permanent tribunal of arbitration , the basic thought of which is as follows : Every signatory Power should designate an e ( lual number of arbitrators ; the names of these arbitrators shall be inscribed upon a general list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l ) erllianent tribunal shall be called together in every ease of conflict between the signatory Powers , if they manifest a desire for such a call . At The hague an " international bureau , " a sort of secretary 's office , shall be established , to serve as a registry office for the international tribunal ; this office shall be furnished for administrative services . Finally , a " permanent council of administration " shall be created at The hague to control the workings of the international bureau . When the English delegation had submitted this project to the Conference , the delegation from the United States of America made a proposition in virtue of which a permanent bureau was to be established at The Hague , and it was proposed that the Court of Justice of each state nominate one member of the international tribunal . According to the American proposition , this tribunal of arbitration should be organized when nine Powers shall have signed the treaty . The Russian proposition rested upon the same basis , as above mentioned . Consequently the Conference at The Hague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration ; proposi // tions emanating from the three greatest Powers of the world . It was , of course , necessary to make a choice from these three propositions . The members of the Committee of Investigation decided unanimously that the basis for discussion on the organization of a permanent tribunal of arbitration should be , exclusively , the English proposition , which emanated from Sir Julian Pauncefote , the eminent English statesman , who , during all his life and his brilliant diplomatic career , had been a confirmed advocate of a permanent tribunal of arbitration . We shall not here enter upon all the details of the discussions on this question . But it is necessary to note that the opposition made by Germany to the permanent tribunal naturally brought about a change , in some respects , in the disposition originally predominating in the Committee of Investigation and the Confei ' - ence . The particular ideas of the German Empire being stated , it became necessary to make some sacrifices . But if the provisions of the treaty of The hague on the permanent tribunal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle ) be examined , it would hardly be atlirmued that the German ideas had completely changed the fundamental idea of a permuanent tribunal ; on the contrary , all the Powers , Germany included , have adopted and organized a permanent tribunal of arbitration under the name of the " Permanent Court of Arbitration . " The signatory Powers reserve the right , in case of conflict , to constitute among themselves a tribunal or court of arbitration . In case they consider it expedient to appeal to the " Pernianent Court of Arbitration , " they may do so on condition that they then submit to the provisions of the Arbitration-Treaty of The Hague . The Permanent Court of Arbitration was organized in the following manner : " Every signatory Power shall designate , within the three months following the ratification by them of the present act , four persons or more , of recognized competency in questions of international law , highly respected on the ground of morals , and disposed to accept the functions of arbitrators . " The persons thus designated shall be entered , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to all the signatory Powers through the agency of the Bureau . " Every change of the list of arbitrators shall , through the agency of the Bureau , be brought to the notice of the signatory Powers . // " The same person may be designated by different Powers . " The members of the Permanent Court of Arbitration are elected for a period of six years . They may be re-elected . " Besides this Court , an " International Bureau " is to be established at The Hague . This Bureau serves as a recording-office for the Court , and is the intermediary for all communications relative to all meetings of the Court . The Bureau preserves the archives and has the management of all the administrative affairs . The Governments bind themselves to communicate to the Bureau such laws , decrees and documents as may serve as a basis for the decisions rendered by the Court . Lastly , there shall be constituted at The IJague a " Permanent Administrative Council , " composed of the diplomatic representatives of the signatory Powers accredited at The Hague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands , who shall hold the office of President . This " Administrative Council " shall have charge of the establishment and organization of the International Bureau , which shall remain under its direction and control . Furthermore , the Permanent Administrative Council shall notify the Powers of the manner in which the Court is constituted and shall provide offices for it . To understand the full import of this organization , it must be added that Powers in conflict , which decide to appeal to the Permanent Court of Arbitration to adjust a difficulty , will choose the arbitrators , to be called to form a Tribunal of Arbitration , which shall be competent to pass upon the differences which have arisen between them . In other words , the Powers in litigation not desiring to constitute a special tribunal of arbitration shall take the list of the arbitrators , constituting the " Permanent Court of Arbitration , " and shall select from that list . When the Tribunal of Arbitration is made up , the Bureau is notified of the fact by the parties concerned , and the Tribunal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the consideration of the matters submitted . Before leaving this subject , it is absolutely essential to say a few words of a proposition made by Baron d'Estournelles , delegate from France , a proposition which took shape in the twentyseventh article of the Treaty of The Hague , which says that " the signatory Powers consider it their duty , in case of serious conflict // arising between two or more among them , to recall to these that the Permanent Court ' is open to them . The fact of thus recalling to the Powers in litigation the provisions of the present treaty and the counsel given  --  to appeal to the Permanent Court of Arbitration ' in the highest interests of peace-shall be considered in no other light than as an act of friendly offices . " Despite the sympathetic purpose of this proposition , it caused considerable misunderstanding . The duty of the signatory Powers to recall to the conflicting Powers the existence of the " Permanent Court of Arbitration , " and the fact of its being open to them , seemed to some to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vexation to the Powers . Finally , after a very animated discussion , all the members of the Conference recognized that the French proposition was not only sympathetically conceived , but also that it encroached in no wise upon the sovereign rights or the national independence of the states , and the article was adopted by the sixteen Powers which , up to the present time , have signed the Treaty . A few words remain to be said on the provisions adopted by the Conference at The Hague as to the procedure in cases of arbitration . Hitherto the Powers in litigation have always confined themselves to determining , in their mutual agreement , the object in litigation , organizing a tribunal of arbitration , determining its competency and the obligatory force of its decision ; but all points of procedure were the vaguest of the vague . No tribunal of arbitration ( such as that on the Alabama Claim in 1873 , or the tribunal in Paris in 1892 , * pro pos of the Behring Sea Fisheries ) had any code of procedure . The total lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before these tribunals of arbitration for the solution of which these tribunals possessed no rule , no basic principles ; and the questions thus raised not only provoked misunderstandings , but occupied much of the time of these tribunals . This great inconvenience was recognized as a flaw in international arbitration as early as 1874 by the " Institute of International Laws . " This society , composed of the most prominent writers on this branch of jurisprudence , had made a code of rules for tribunals of arbitration ; but , despite its great scientific merits , this code of rules did not always provide means of meeting the difficulties presented by practical arbitration . // The fundamental provisions of the code of procedure adopted by the Conference at The Hague are as follows : The Powers having recourse to arbitration shall sign an international act *r compromise , in which shall be clearly set forth the objects of contention and the extent of the powers vested in the arbitrators. the Powers , at their option , may designate the arbitrators ; may make a choice from the Permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or may establish a 51 ) ecial tribunal . In case the contending Powers do not come to a special agreeinent as to the constitution of a tribunal of arbitration , it is recommended that each side name two arbitrators and let these choose one additional . In case of a tie vote , the choice of the additional arbitrator is left to a neutral Power , to be designated by the Powers in contention . If the choice of a neutral Power can not be agreed upon by the contending Powers , each side shall name a Power and the choice of the additional arbitrator shall be left to these two Powers . The place of meeting for the Tribunal of Arbitration thus constituted shall be designated by the parties in contention ; in the absence of a definite appointment , the special Tribunal of Arbitration meets at The Hague . Procedure in arbitration involves two distinct phases : one , instruction ; the other , debate . Instruction consists of communications made by the respective agents of the contending Powers to the members of the tribunal and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all documents referring to the case . Debates before the tribunal of arbitration shall consist of verbal elaborations of the contentions held . When instructions have closed , the tribunal has the right to exclude from debate all new records or documents which one side may wish to submit without the consent of the other . The tribunal may require that the agents of the parties contending shall produce all records and may demand all necessary explanations . The agents or counsels of the parties are authorized to present to the tribunal orally all materials which they consider useful in the defense of their cause . The members of the tribunal have the right to put questions to the agents or counsels of the parties and to demand elucidation of doubtful points . Neither the questions so put nor the remarks made by members of the // tribunal during the course of the debate shall be regarded as the expression of an opinion on the part of the tribunal in general or of the interrupting member in particular . Furthermore , the code of arbitration has settled one question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shall have the right to decide upon the competency of the tribunal itself . It will be remembered that it was on this point that the Geneva Arbitration on the Alabama Claim failed . But this question is solved in the forty-eighth article of the treaty , in which it is stated that the tribunal is authorized to determine its competency by interpreting the compromise along the line of such precedents as can be applied , and by applying the principles of international law . The decree in arbitration determined by a majority vote is to be acknowledged and signed by each member of the tribunal , and , being binding upon the contending Poxvers , it shall be read in open session of the tribunal . By this decree in arbitration the quarrel is adjusted definitely and without appeal . The delegation from the United States , however , through Mr. Holls , proposed that a decree of arbitration should be subject to revision , if , within three months after the announcement of the decree , there should be discovered a new fact which , in the judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decisive influence upon the decree . But , under these conditions , the decree in arbitration would not really exist during the three months which follow its promulgation , and it is quite certain that the Power which lost its case would do its utmost to discover such a new fact for the purpose of securing the revision . The passions which were running high before the constitution of the Tribunal of Arbitration would grow to unexpected proportions after the decree in arbitration had been made public . The Conference at The Hague united upon the opinion of the author of this essay , and adopted the proposition made by the delegate from the Netherlands , and accepted by the delegation from Russia , on the strength of which parties desiring to have a decree in arbitration revised have the right to do so by means of a particular compromise between themselves . But , on general principles , the decree in arbitration once announced closes the case for the parties in dispute . It is an incontestable fact that no international conference // has ever aroused so many hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the very outset , when this Conference was first called , this opposition was almost legitimate , for the problems placed before it were , indeed , of a difficult nature : but it seems singular that , now , when the Conference has finished its labors and the results of its labors are more or less accessible to all the world , the attacks continue . It may be useful , therefore , to compare the Conference at The Hague with other international conferences or congresses which are notable in the history of the nineteenth century . Take , for example , the Congress of Vienna in 1815 . The highest hopes were centred upon that Congress ; the nations expected the greatest benefits from it . It lasted nearly a year , and closed with a great demonstration ; but if it be asked what this Congress has left to posterity and to us , the reply must be , next to nothing . All its leading provisions concerning political interests and the territorial rights of nations have either changed or been reversed . The only provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure for it a prominent and honorable place in the history of international law , are a few provisions which concern navigation of international streams and the declaration that the slave-trade is abolished forever . Turning to the Congress of Paris of 1856 , by which the Crimean War was closed , we see that the exclusive object of the provisions of the Treaty of Paris was to rearrange the status quo in Turkey . If that Congress has hitherto held a conspicuous place in the history of the progress of international relations , it is due to the famous declaration on maritime law . If we pass on to the Congress of Berlin in 1878 , we note that it was presided over by the most practical politician of the nineteenth century , Prince Bismarek , and that the Treaty of Berlin altered the condition of things created by the Treaty of Paris in 1856 , 50 far as the Balkan Peninsula was concerned . It has left nothing behind which tends to the pacific and progressive development of international relations . It had in view nothing but the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop under the influence of circumstances , of time and the prejudices of the nations . If now we ask ourselves what place is occupied among the various congresses and conferences which have taken place dur // ing the century by the Conference at The Hague , it will incontestably appear that all the international actions taken by it will ever remain the foundation , the corner-stone , of every useful attempt made towards the establishment of normal and peaceful relations between the nations , and of creating an order of things more in conformity with the permanent and legitimate interest of the nations independent of the transitory aspirations of statesmen . No conference , no congress , no meeting in the future , whose aim and task it shall be to occupy itself with matters pertaining to the progressive development of international life in peace and in war , can ignore the labors of this Conference at The Hague or take the least step along this pathway , without reverting to the procs- verbeaux of the Peace Conferenee of 1899 . This conclusion is the result of the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Treaty of Arbitration , of which we have above explained the principal propositions , will ever be the basis of all new propositions adopted in the future by the Powers for the purpose of developing and securing peaceful solutions of disputes . The treaty on the laws and customs of war will certainly be as notable as the treaty on arbitration . By reason of this treaty the peaceful and unarmed inhabitants of the territory of belligerents will have the right to demand that their lives , their religious convictions and their private property shall be respected . Through it prisoners of war will be treated not as enemies , but as disarmed and honorable adversaries , worthy of respect . Through it social institutions , beneficiary establishments , religious , scientific and otherwise , which find themselves on disputed territory , shall have the right to demand and to exact of the enemy respect for the inviolability of their property and their interests . Finally , the Red Cross treaty for times of naval warfare , signed by the Conference at The Hague , is the happy solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying for thirty years . Since 1868 the " Additional Articles " to the Treaty of Geneva have existed , whereby the beneficent influence of the Treaty of Geneva on wounded and sick soldiers was also extended to sea combats . For thirty-one years diplomatic negotiations have been carried on on this question ; all the Red Cross conferences which have taken place in the last twenty years have proclaimed the necessity of recognizing the Red Cross treaty for // the sick and wounded in naval warfare . But nothing effectual was accomplished up to the Conference at The Hague . It was this Conference that caused the final adoption by sixteen Powers of Europe of the principle whereby the wounded in times of naval warfare shall have the same right to have their person , their life , their health and their property respected , as the wounded in case of warfare on land . In conclusion we ought to make one further observation of indisputable interest . None of the congresses and conferences hitherto held can be compared with the Conference at The Hague with respect to ethnic structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a limited number of states were represented . In almost all cases the great Powers actually decided the questions for the nations . But at the Conference at The Hague , twentysix Powers were represented ! There were more than one hundred and ten delegates there from these Powers . The delegates represented not only the Powers of Europe , not only the Great Power of America , but also Turkey , Persia , China , Japan . The session-hall of the Conference at The Hague , in the royal palace of the Huis ten Bosch , can not be compared with the session-hall of the Congress of Paris , of Berlin or of Vienna . In this session-hall the delegates of the twenty-six Powers were not seated about a table ; there could have been no such table . They were separately grouped in a great hall , which represented , as has been said of it , a sort of " International Parliament . " The consultations were not secret negotiations , " behind the scenes . " But great questions were elucidated by discourses and study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representatives of three parts of the world . Finally , and it is a happy token to note , the longer the labors of the Conference at The Hague lasted , the more fully views were exchanged among the representatives of the different Powers , the more pronounced grew the mutual respect , the more friendly grew I he personal relations , the more palpable became the desire to do something for the future . This is a most encouraging fact which explains much in the past and is full of high promise for the future.
