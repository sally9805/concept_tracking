The woodwork and furniture are in the period of Louis XVI . The walls and furniture are covered with yellow brocade , and the curtains are of the same golden material . At the back are two large windows which give out on Fifth Avenue , opposite the Park , the trees of which are seen across the way . At Left is a double doorway , leading into the hall . At Right , opposite , is a door which leads to other rooms , and thence to other parts of the house . In the centre , at back , between the two windows , is the fireplace ; on the mantel are two vases and a clock in dark blue ormolu . There is a white and gold piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests much wealth , and that it has been done by a professional decorator ; the personal note of taste is lacking . It is four o'clock in the afternoon . The shades of the windows are drawn down . There are rows and rows of camp-chairs filling the entire room . The curtain rises slowly . After a moment , Jordan , the butler , and Leonard , a footman , enter from the Left and begin to gather together and carry out the camp-chairs . They do this with very serious faces , and take great pains to step softly and to make no noise . They enter a second time for more chairs . Jordan . JordanWhispers to Leonard . When are they coming for the chairs ? Leonard . Leonar d Whispers back . To-night . Say , it was fine , was n't it ! Jordan . Jordan Grand ! They go out with the chairs and immediately renter for more . They are followed in this time by a lady 's maid , Tompson ; she is not a young woman . As she crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has fallen from some emblem . She goes to the window at Right , and peeps out . She turns around and looks at the others . They all speak in subdued voices . Tompson . Tompson Jordan , what do you think  --  can we raise the shades now ? Jordan . Jordan Yes , of course  --  after they 've left the house it 's all over as far as we here are concerned . She raises both shades . Tompson . Tompson Phew ! what an odor of flowers ! She opens one of the windows a little . Marie , a young , pretty , French woman , enters from the Right . Marie . Marie Will I help you ? Tompson . Tompson Just with this table , thank you , Marie . They begin to rearrange the room , putting it in its normal condition . They replace the table and put back the ornaments upon it . Poor Mr. Hunter , and him so fond of mince pie . I shall never forget how that man ate mince pie . She sighs lugubriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard I hope as how it 's not going to make any difference with us . Jordan . Jordan Pom pously . Of course not ; was n't Mr. Hunter a millionnaire ? Tompson . Tompson Some millionnaires I 've known turned out poor as Job 's turkey in their coffins ! Marie . Marie What you say ? You tink we shall ' ave some of madame 's or ze young ladies ' dresses ? Tompson . Tompson Hopefully . Perhaps . Marie . Marie I ' ave already made my choice . I like ze pale pink of Mees Jessie . Leonard . Leonard Sh ! I heard a carridge . Tompson . Tompson Then they 're coming back . Marie quickly goes out Right . Jordan . Jordan To Leonard , hurriedly , as he quickly goes out Left . Take them last two chairs ! Leonard , with the chairs , follows Jordan out Left . Tompson hastily puts back a last armchair to its usual position in the room and goes out Right . Mrs. Hunter enters Left , followed by her three daughters , Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a small , attractive child , five years of age . All are in the deepest conventional mourning , Mrs. Hunter in widow 's weeds and Clara with a heavy , black chiffon veil ; the Boy is also dressed in conventional mourning . As soon as they enter , all four women lift their veils . Mrs. Hunter is a well-preserved woman , with a pretty , rather foolish , and somewhat querulous face . Her figure is the latest mode . Blanche Sterling , her oldest daughter , is her antithesis ,  --  a handsome , dignified woman , young , sincere , and showing , in her attitude to the others and in her own point of view , the warmth of a true , evenly-balanced nature . Jessica is a typical second child ,  --  nice , good , self-effacing , sympathetic , unspoiled . Clara is her opposite ,  --  spoiled , petulant , pretty , pert , and selfish . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter With a long sigh . Oh , I am so glad to be back home and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sigh of relief into a big chair . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Takes her son to Mrs. Hunter . Kiss grandmother good-by , and then Leonard will take you home . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Good-by , dear . Be a good boy . Do n't eat too much candy . Kisses him carelessly . Master Sterling . Master Sterling Good-by . Runs towards the door Left , shouting happily . Leonard ! Leonard ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Tearfully . My dears , it was a great success ! Everybody was there ! The three younger women stand and look about the room , as if it were strange to them  --  as if it were empty . There is a moment 's silence . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Tenderly . Mother , why do n't you take off your bonnet ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Take it off for me ; it will be a great relief . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Help me , Jess . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Irritably . Yes , do something , Jessie . You 've mortified me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People 'll think you did n't love your father . The two are taking of Mrs. Hunter 's bonnet . Mrs. Hunter waits for an answer from Jessica ; none comes . I never saw any one so heartless ! Tearful again . And her father adored her . She was one of the things we quarrelled most about ! Over Mrs. Hunter 's head Blanche exchanges a sympathetic look with Jessica to show she understands . Clara . Clara Hunter I 'm sure I 've cried enough . I 've cried buckets . She goes to Mrs. Hunter as Blanche and Jessica take away the bonnet and veil and put them on the piano . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Kissing Clara . Yes , dear , you are your mother 's own child . And you lose the most by it , too . Leaning against the side of her mother 's chair , with one arm about her mother . Clara . Clara Hunter Yes , indeed , instead of coming out next month , and having a perfectly lovely winter , I 'll have to mope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out , be a wallflower without ever having been a bud ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Half amused but feeling Clara 's remark is perhaps not quite the right thing . Sh  --  During Clara 's speech above , Blanche has taken Jessica in her arms a moment and kissed her tenderly , slowly . They rejoin Mrs. Hunter , Blanche wiping her eyes , Jessica still tearless . Clara . Clara Hunter And think of all the clothes we brought home from Paris last month ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter My dear , do n't think of clothes  --  think of your poor father ! That street dress of mine will dye very well , and we 'll give the rest to your aunt and cousins . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Mother , do n't you want to go upstairs ? Jessica . Jessica Hunter Sincerely moved . Yes , I hate this room now . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Rising . Hate this room ! When we 've just had it done ! Louis Kinge ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Louis Quinze , dear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Hunter Oh , yes , but that 's weak and foolish , Jessie . No , Blanche  --  Sitting again.  --  I 'm too exhausted to move . Ring for tea . Blanche rings the bell beside the mantel . Clara . Clara Hunter Crossing to piano , forgets and starts to play a music-hall song , but Mrs. Hunter stops her . Oh , yes , tea ! I 'm starved ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Clara , darling ! As if you could be hungry at such a time ! Jordan enters Left . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Tea , Jordan . Jordan . Jordan Yes , madam . He goes out Left . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Girls , everybody in town was there ! I 'm sure even your father himself could n't have complained . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Mother ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Well , you know he always found fault with my parties being too mixed . He would n't realize I could n't throw over all my old set when I married into his ,  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I consider my family was just as good as his , only we were Presbyterians ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Mother , dear , take off your gloves . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I thought I had . Crying . I 'm so heartbroken I do n't know what I 'm doing . Taking of her gloves . Blanche and Clara comfort their mother . Jessica . Jessica Hunter Here 's the tea  --  Jordan and Leonard enter with large , silver tray , with tea , cups , and thin bread-and-butter sandwiches . They place them on small tea-table which Jessica arranges for them . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I 'm afraid I ca n't touch it . Taking her place behind tea-table and biting eagerly into a sandwich . Jessica . Jessica Hunter Dryly . Try . Blanche pours tea for than all , which they take in turn . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Eating . One thing I was furious about ,  --  did you see the Witherspoons here at the house ? Clara . Clara Hunter I did . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They are the worst social pushers I 've ever known . She takes another sandwich . Clara . Clara Hunter Trying to make people think they are on our visiting list ! Using even a funeral to get in ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter But I was glad the Worthings were here , and I thought it sweet of old Mr. Dormer to go even to the cemetery . Voice breaks a little . He never goes to balls any more , and , they say , catches cold at the slightest change of temperature She takes a third sandwich . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling A great many people loved father . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Irritably . They ought to 've . It was really foolish the way he was always doing something for somebody ! How good these sandwiches are ! Spoken very plaintively . Jessica . Jessica Hunter Shall we have to economize now , mother ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Of course not ; how dare you suggest such an injustice to your father , and before the flowers are withered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small silver tray , heaping full of letters . Has the new writing paper come ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Who takes the letters and looks through them , giving some to her mother . Yes . Blanche reads a letter , and passes it to Jessica . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Is the black border broad enough ? They said it was the thing . Clara . Clara Hunter If you had it any broader , you 'd have to get white ink to write with ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Sweetly . Do n't be impertinent , darling ! Reading another letter . Enter Miss Ruth Hunter . She is an unmarried woman between thirty and forty years of age , handsome , distinguished ; an aristocrat , without any pretensions ; simple , unaffected , and direct in her effort to do kindnesses where they are not absolutely undeserved . She enters the room as if she carried with her an atmosphere of pure ozone . This affects all those in it . She is dressed in deep mourning and wears a thick chiffon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ruth Oh ! you 're having tea ! Glad that they are . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Taking a second cup . I thought the children ought to . Ruth . Ruth Of course they ought and so ought you , if you have n't . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Oh , I 've trifled with something . Jessica . Jessica Hunter Sit here , Aunt Ruth . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Will you have a cup , Aunt Ruth ? Ruth . Ruth Yes , dear , I 'm feeling very hungry . Sitting on the sofa beside Jessica and pressing her hand as she does so . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Hungry ! How can you ! Ruth . Ruth Because I 'm not a hypocrite ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Whimpering . I suppose that 's a slur at me ! Ruth . Ruth If the slipper fits ! But I confess I have n't eaten much for several days ; I could n't touch anything this morning , and I begin to feel exhausted ; I must have food and , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanche , taking the cup from her . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I think it 's awful , Ruth , and I feel I have a right to say it  --  I think you owed it to my feelings to have worn a long veil ; people will think you did n't love your brother . Ruth . Ruth Dr yly . Will they ? Let them ! You know as well as I do that George loathed the very idea of crpe and all display of mourning . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Feeling out of her element , changes the subject . You stayed behind ? Ruth . Ruth Yes . I wanted to be the last there . Her voice chokes ; she tries to control herself . Ah ! you see my nerves are all gone to pieces . I wo n't cry any more ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I do n't see how you could bear it  --  staying ; but you never had any heart , Ruth . Ruth . Ruth Mecha nically , biting her lips hard to keep the tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter My darling husband always felt that defect in you . Ruth . Ruth George ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter He resented your treatment of me , and often said so . Ruth . Ruth Very quietly , but with determination . Please be careful . Do n't talk to me like this about my brother , Florence  --  or you 'll make me say something I shall be sorry for . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I do n't care ! It wore on him , the way you treated me . I put up with it for his sake , but it helped undermine his health . Ruth . Ruth Florence , stop ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter In foolish anger , the resentment of years bursting out . I wo n't stop ! I 'm alone now , and the least you can do is to see that people who 've fought shy of me take me up and give me my due . You 've been a cruel , selfish sister-in-law , and your own brother saw and hated you for it ! Blanche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughters out of the room ; I wish to answer you alone . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Frightened . No ! what you have to say to me I prefer my children to hear ! Clara comes over to her mother and puts her arm about her . Ruth . Ruth I ca n't remain quiet any longer . George  --  She almost breaks down , but she controls herself . This funeral is enough , with its show and worldliness ! I do n't believe there was a soul in the church you did n't see ! Look at your handkerchief ! Real grief is n't measured by the width of a black border . I 'm ashamed of you , Florence ! I never liked you very much , although I tried to for your husband 's sake , but now I 'm even more ashamed of you . My dear brother is gone , and there need be no further bond between us , but I want you to understand the true reason why , from to-day , I keep away from you . This funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social function , and for him who you know hated the very thing . She stops a moment to control her tears and her anger . I saw the reporters there , and I heard your message to them , and I contradicted it . I begged them not to use your information , and they were gentlemen and promised me not to . You are , and always have been , a silly , frivolous woman . I do n't doubt you loved your husband as much as you could any man , but it was n't enough for me ; he was worth being adored by the best and noblest woman in the world . I 've stood by all these years , trying with my love and silent sympathy to be some comfort to him  --  but I saw the disappointment and disillusionment eat away the very hope of happiness out of his heart . I tried to help him by helping you in your foolish ambitions , doing what I could to give my brother 's wife the social position his name entitled her to ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had to fight it out all alone ! Ruth . Ruth It was not my fault if my best friends found you intolerable ; I could n't blame them . Well , now it 's over ! George is at rest , please God . You are a rich woman to do what you please . Go , and do it ! and Heaven forgive you for ruining my brother 's life ! I 'm sorry to have said all this before your children . Blanche , you know how dearly I love you , and I hope you have forgiven me by now for my opposition to your marriage . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Of course I 've forgiven you , but you were always unjust to Dick . Ruth . Ruth Yes ; I did n't like your husband then , and I did n't believe in him , but I like him better now . And I am going to put all my affairs in his hands . I could n't show  --  surely  --  a better proof of confidence and liking than that : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope I shall see much of you and Jessica . As for you , Clara , I must be honest  --  Clara . Clara Hunter Interrupting her . Oh , I know you 've always hated me ! The presents you gave the other girls were always twice as nice as I got ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Sympathetically . Come here , darling . Clara goes and puts her arms about her mother 's neck . Ruth . Ruth You are your mother 's own child , Clara , and I never could pretend anything I did n't feel . She turns to Blanche and Jessica , who stand side by side . You two are all I have left in the world of my brother . She kisses them , and lets the tears come , this time without struggling . Take pity on your old-maid aunt and come and see me , wo n't you , often  --  Trying to smile away her tears . And now good-by ! Jessica and Ruth . Jessica Hunter and Ruth Taking her hands . Good-by . Ruth looks about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly begins pulling down her veil , and starts to go out as Jordan enters Left and announces " Mr. Mason ! " Mrs. Hunter fluffs her hair a little and hopes she looks becoming . Mason is a typical New Yorker , well built , well preserved , dignified , and good-looking ,  --  a solid man in every sense of the word . Mason . Frederick Mason Meeting Ruth , shakes hands with her . Miss Hunter . Ruth . Ruth I am just going , Mr. Mason . Mason . Frederick Mason You must stay . I sent word to your house this morning to meet me here . Shakes hands with the others . Ruth . Ruth I was here all night . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Will you have some tea ? The children were hungry . Mason . Frederick Mason No , thank you . To Blanche . Is n't your husband here ? Jordan , at a signal from Mrs. Hunter , removes the tea things . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling No , he left us at the door when we came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from me this morning asking him to meet me here ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Oh , yes , he did mention a letter at breakfast , but my thoughts were away . He has been very much worried lately over his affairs ; he does n't confide in me , but I see it . I wish you could advise him , Mr. Mason . Mason . Frederick Mason I can not advise your husband if he wo n't ask my advice . I do n't think we 'll wait for Mr. Sterling . Gives chair to Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I suppose you 've come about all the horrid business . Why not just tell us how much our income is , and let all the details go . I really think the details are more than I can bear to-day . Mason . Frederick Mason That can be certainly as you wish ; but I felt  --  as your business adviser  --  and besides I promised my old friend , your husband  --  it was my duty to let you know how matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hunter Beginning to break down . George ! George ! Ruth looks at her , furious , and bites her lips hard . Jessica is standing with her back toward them . Mason . Frederick Mason Well , then  --  He is interrupted by Mrs. Hunter , who sees Jessica . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Jess ! How rude you are ! Turn around this minute ! Jessica does not move . What do you mean ! Excuse me , Mr. Mason ! Jess ! Such disrespect to your father 's will ! Turn around ! Angry . Do you hear me ? Jessica . Jessica Hunter With her back still turned , her shoulders shaking , speaks in a voice broken with sobs . Leave me alone ! Leave me alone  --  She sits in a chair beside her and leans her arms upon its back and buries her face in her arms . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling With her hand on her mother 's arm . Mother ! Do n't worry her ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Go on , please , Mr. Mason , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income ? Mason . Frederick Mason Mrs. Hunter , there is no income . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Quietly , not at all grasping what he means . No income ! How is our money  --  Mason . Frederick Mason I am sorry to say there is no money . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Echoes weakly . No money ? Mason . Frederick Mason Not a penny ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Realizing now what he means , cries out in a loud , hard , amazed voice . What ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling With her hand on her shoulder . Mother ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I do n't believe it ! Ruth . Ruth To Mason . My good friend , do you mean that literally  --  that my brother died without leaving any money behind him ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter For his wife and family ? Mason . Frederick Mason I mean just that . Ruth . Ruth But how ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Yes , tell us the details  --  every one of them ! You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick Mason Hunter sent for me two days before he died , and told me things had gone badly with him last year , but it seemed impossible to retrench his expenses . Ruth . Ruth Are you listening , Florence ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Yes , of course I am ; your brother was a very extravagant man ! Mason . Frederick Mason This year , with his third daughter coming out , there was need of more money than ever . He was harassed nearly to death with financial worries . Ruth begins to cry softly . Mrs. Hunter gets angrier and angrier . And finally , in sheer desperation , and trusting to the advice of the Storrings , he risked everything he had with them in the Consolidated Copper . The day after , he was taken ill . You know what happened . The Storrings , Hunter , and others were ruined absolutely ; the next day Hunter died . Ruth . Ruth Poor George ! Why did n't he come to me ; he must have known that everything I had was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final blow came to realize it . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Angry . But his life insurance ,  --  there was a big policy in my name . Mason . Frederick Mason He had been obliged to let that lapse . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter You mean I have n't even my life insurance ? Mason . Frederick Mason As I said , there is nothing , except this house , and that is  --  Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Rises indignantly and almost screams in angry hysterics . Mortgaged , I presume ! Oh , it 's insulting ! It 's an indignity . It 's  --  it 's  --  Oh , well , it 's just like my husband , there ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Mother ! Ruth rises , and , taking Mason 's arm , leads him aside . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter To Blanche . Oh , do n't talk to me now ! You always preferred your father , and now you 're punished for it ! He has wilfully left your mother and sisters paupers ! Blanche . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know father must have suffered more than we could when he realized he was leaving nothing for you . Jessica . Jessica Hunter Yes , and it was for us too that he lost all . It was our extravagance . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Hush ! How dare you side against me , too ? Ruth . Ruth Florence  --  Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Well , Ruth , what do you think of your brother now ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling To her mother . Do n't ! Mason . Frederick Mason By whom were the arrangements for to-day made ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter My son-in-law had most pressing business , and his friend  --  Blanche . Mrs. Sterling The friend of all of us  --  Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Yes , of course , Mr. Warden saw to everything . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling He will be here any moment ! Mason . Frederick Mason When he comes , will you send him on to me , please ? Ruth . Ruth Yes . Mason . Frederick Mason Very well . Good-by . Shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the bearer of such bad news . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Shaking hands with him . Please overlook anything I may have said ; at such a moment , with the loss of all my money  --  and my dear husband  --  I do n't know what to say ! Mason . Frederick Mason Naturally . To the others . Good-by . To Ruth , who follows him . I 'll come to see you in the morning . As they shake hands . Ruth . Ruth And I can then tell you what I settle here now . Mason goes out Left . Florence , I 'm very sorry  --  Interrupted . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Oh ! You ! Sorry ! Ruth . Ruth Yes , very , very sorry ,  --  first , that I spoke as I did just now . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter It 's too late to be sorry for that now . Ruth . Ruth No , it is n't , and I 'll prove to you I mean it . Come , we 'll talk things over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want you to prove anything to me ! Mrs. Hunter and Clara sit side by side on the sofa . Blanche and Jessica are in chairs near the table . Ruth sits beside Blanche . Mrs. Hunter has something the manner of porcupines and shows a set determination to accept nothing by way of comfort or expedient . Blanche looks hopeful and ready to take the helm for the family . Jessica will back up Blanche . My happiness in this world is over . What have I to live for ? Ruth . Ruth Your children ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Beggars like myself ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling But your children will work for you . Clara . Clara Hunter Work ! I see myself . Ruth . Ruth So do I. Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter My children work ! Do n't be absurd ! Jessica . Jessica Hunter It is not absurd ! I can certainly earn my own living somehow and so can Clara . Clara .

Ruth . Ruth I will gladly give Jessica a home . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Whimpers . You 'd rob me of my children , too ! Jessica . Jessica Hunter Thank you , Aunt Ruth , but I must stay with mother and be Blanche 's right-hand man ! Clara . Clara Hunter I might go on the stage . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter My dear , smart people do n't any more . Clara . Clara Hunter I 'd like to be a sort of Anna Held . Jessica . Jessica Hunter I do n't see why I could n't learn typewriting , Blanche ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Huh ! Why , you could never even learn to play the piano ; I do n't think you 'd be much good at typewriting . Clara . Clara Hunter You want to be a there is to be any " old man 's darling " in this family , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to learn to spell correctly first ! Clara . Clara Hunter Superciliously . Humph ! Jessica . Jessica Hunter There are lots of ways nowadays for women to earn their living . Ruth . Ruth Yes , typewriting we will consider . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Never ! No one pays any attention to her except Clara , who agrees with her . Ruth . Ruth Jess , you learned enough to teach , did n't you ?  --  even at that fashionable school your mother sent you to ? Jessica . Jessica Hunter Oh , yes , I think I could teach . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Never ! Still no one pays any attention except Clara , who again agrees with her . Clara . Clara Hunter No , indeed ! I would n't teach ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling If we only knew some nice elderly woman who wanted a companion , Jess would be a godsend . Clara . Clara Hunter If she was a nice old lady with lots of money and delicate health , I would n't mind that position myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter as a supreme joke ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter With mock humility . May I speak ? She waits . All turn to her . A moment 's silence . May I speak ? Ruth . Ruth Yes , yes . Go on , Florence ; do n't you see we 're listening ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I did n't know ! I 've been so completely ignored in this entire conversation . But there is one thing for the girls  --  the easiest possible way for them to earn their living  --  which you do n't seem for a moment to have thought of ! She waits with a smile of coming triumph on her face . Ruth . Ruth Nursing ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Disgusted . No ! Clara . Clara Hunter Manicuring ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Darling ! Blanche .

Jessica Hunter Mother , you ca n't be serious . Clara . Clara Hunter Why would n't he do for me ? Ruth . Ruth He would ! The very thing ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter We 'll see , darling ; I think Europe is the place for you . I do n't believe all the titles are gobbled up yet . Ruth . Ruth Jess , I might get you some women friends of mine , to whom you could go mornings and answer their letters . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I should not allow my daughter to go in that capacity to the house of any woman who had refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of your friends have treated me ! Ruth . Ruth Do you realize , Florence , this is a question of bread and butter , a practical suggestion of life , which has nothing whatever to do with the society columns of the daily papers ? Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I do not intend that my daughters shall lose their positions because their father has been  --  what shall we call it  --  criminally negligent of them . Ruth . Ruth Risin g . How dare you ! You are to blame for it all . If you say another word injurious to my brother 's memory , I 'll leave this house and let you starve for all I 'll do for you . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Aunt Ruth , please , for father 's sake  --  Clara . Clara Hunter Well , this house is ours , anyway ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling That is what I 've been thinking of . The house is yours . It 's huge . You do n't reed it . You must either give it up altogether  --  Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My house ! Never ! Blanche .

Mrs. Hunter Who has listened aghast , now rises in outraged dignity ; she stands a moment glaring at Blanche , then speaks . Take  --  She chokes . That is the last straw ! And she sweeps from the room Right . Clara . Clara Hunter Mama ! Mama ! She goes out after her mother . The other three women watch the two leave the room , then turn and look at each other . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling We 'll manage somehow , only I think it would be easier for us to discuss all practical matters by ourselves . Ruth .

Sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forty , a singularly attractive personality ; he is handsome and distinguished . His hair is grayer than his years may account for and his manner betrays a nervous system overtaxed and barely under control . At the moment that he enters he is evidently laboring under some especial , and only half-concealed , nervous strain . In spite of his irritability at times with his wife , there is an undercurrent of tenderness which reveals his real love for Blanche . Sterling . Richard Sterling Oh , you 're all here ! Have I missed old Mason ? Ruth . Ruth Yes , but Blanche will tell you what he had to say . I 'm going upstairs to try and pacify your mother . We must n't forget she has a hard time ahead of her . She goes out Right with Jessica . Sterling . Richard Sterling I suppose Mason came about the will and your father 's affairs ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Yes , you ought to have been here . Sterling . Richard Sterling Irritably . But I could n't  --  I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize , dear , that you have n't been able to do anything for me for a long time ? Lately , even I hardly ever see you  --  I stay home night after night alone . Sterling . Richard Sterling That 's your own fault , dear ; Ned Warden 's always ready to take you anywhere you like . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling With the ghost of a jest . But do you think it 's quite right for me to take up all Mr Warden 's time ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Why not , if he likes it ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling And do n't you think people will soon talk ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Darling ! People always talk , and who cares ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling It 's months since you showed me any sign of affection , and now when my heart is hungrier than ever for it ,  --  you know how I loved my father ,  --  I long for sympathy from you , and you have n't once thought to take me , your wife , in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It 's only because I 've been terribly worried . I do n't want to bother you with business , but I 've been in an awful hole for money . I tried to make a big coup in Wall Street the other day and only succeeded getting in deeper , and for the last few days I 've been nearly distracted . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Why did n't you tell me ? Sterling . Richard Sterling I thought I 'd get out of it with this Consolidated Copper without worrying you . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling You were in that , too ? Sterling . Richard Sterling How do you mean I , " too " ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Mr. Mason has just told us father lost everything in it . Sterling . Richard Sterling Aghast .

You are not the man I thought when I married you ! Every day something new happens to frighten me , to threaten my love for you ! Sterling . Richard Sterling No , no , do n't say that , old girl . He tries to take her hand . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling What right have you to criticise my father , to curse him  --  and to-day ! Sterling . Richard Sterling I do n't know what I 'm saying , Blanche .

Disgrace was too strong a word  --  I did n't mean that . I 'm in trouble . I 'm in trouble . Good God , ca n't you see it ? And if you love me , why do n't you leave me alone ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling How can I go on loving you without your confidence ?  --  without ever being suffered to give you any sympathy ? Doll wives are out of fashion , and even if they were n't , I could never be one . Sterling . Richard Sterling Laughing . My dear , I 'd never accuse you of being stuffed with sawdust . Blanche .

You 've been putting me more and more completely out of your life ; take care that I do n't finish your work and go the last step . Sterling . Richard Sterling Seizing her roughly by the wrist . The last step ! What do you mean by that ? Holding her hand more roughly . You dare to be unfaithful to me ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling What ! You could think I meant that ! Ugh ! How could you ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Well , what did you mean then ? Eh ? Pulling her up close to him , her face close to his . She realizes first by the odor , then by a searching look at his face , that he is partly under the influence of liquor . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling With pathetic shame . Let 've been drinking .

I must have a new business man now to do all that he did for me , and I 'm going to try to make up to you for not having been always your  --  best friend , by putting my affairs in your hands . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Serious , uneasy , almost frightened . Aunt Ruth  --  She stops . Ruth . Ruth What , dear ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Nothing . She gives Sterling a searching , steady look and keeps her eyes upon him , trying to read his real self . Ruth . Ruth Continues to Sterling . Mr. Mason is coming to me in the morning , and if you will lunch with me at one , I will then be able to give all the papers over to you . Sterling , who up to this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now collects himself , and speaks delightedly but with sufficient reserve of his feelings . Blanche does not take her eyes from Sterling 's face . Sterling . Richard Sterling Aunt Ruth , I thank you from the bottom of my heart , and I will do my best . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Quickly . Promise her , Dick , before me  --  give her your word of honor  --  you will be faithful to Aunt Ruth 's trust . He answers Blanche 's look steadily with a hard gaze of his own . Ruth . Ruth His acceptance of my trust is equal to that , Blanche . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling It is of course , is n't it , Dick ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Of course . Blanche is not content , but has to satisfy herself with this . Ruth . Ruth To-morrow at one , then . She starts to go . Jordan enters Left . Jordan . Jordan Mr. Warden . Ruth . Ruth I ca n't wait .

Richard Sterling Do n't say that , old girl , and do n't think it . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Dick , you are honest , are n't you ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Without flinching . What a question , Blanche ! Jordan enters Left announcing " Mr. Warden . " Warden enters , and Jordan goes out . Edward Warden , though in reality scarcely younger than Sterling , looks at least ten years his junior . He is good-looking , practical , a reasoning being , and self-controlled . He is a thorough American , with the fresh and strong ideals of his race , and with the feeling of romance alive in the bottom of his heart . Sterling . Richard Sterling In enormous relief , greets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greatest news going ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Dick ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Excuse me , Blanche , I forgot ; but Ned will know how I ca n't help being glad . Warden goes to Mrs. Sterling . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Shaking Ned 's hand . And Mr. Warden knows nothing could make me " glad " to-day . Thank you for all your kindness  --  Warden . Edward Warden Do n't thank me ; it was nothing . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Yes , please let me thank you all I can ; it wo n't be half what I feel , but I want to know that you know even my silence is full of gratitude for all you 've done for my mother , sisters , and me . Sterling . Richard Sterling Yes , we 're all immensely indebted to you , Ned , old man . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I will tell mother . I know she wants to see you . She goes out Right . Sterling .

Sterling . Richard Sterling It seems he 's been losing for a long time . Everything he had he lost in the copper crash . Warden . Edward Warden But this is awful ! What will Mrs. Hunter and her two young daughters do ? Sterling . Richard Sterling I do n't know . I had n't thought of that . Warden . Edward Warden You 'll have to think of it . Sterling . Richard Sterling I ? Warden . Edward Warden Of course you 'll have to help them . Sterling . Richard Sterling I ca n't !

Edward Warden Strongly . Good things to borrow on ! Look here , Dick , how long have we been friends ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Since that day at boarding school when you took a licking for something I did . Warden . Edward Warden What I mean is we were pals at school , chums at college , stanch friends for twenty years . Sterling . Richard Sterling Hell ! Are we as old as all that ? Warden . Edward Warden Inseparable friends till the last two years . Sterling 's eyes shift . Sterling . Richard Sterling I 've been overworked lately , and everything has gone wrong !

Sterling does nothing . I was never sure till to-day ! I fought against ever thinking it , believing my suspicions were an injustice to you , but little things were always disappearing out of my rooms  --  finally , even money . Lately , that old suspicion has come back with a fuller force , and to-day it became a certainty . Sterling . Richard Sterling How to-day ? Warden . Edward Warden Because if it were n't true , you 'd have knocked me down just now when I called you first a thief and twice a liar ! He stands squarely facing him . Sterling stands facing him also , surprised , taken off his guard . Sterling . Richard Sterling Oh , come , you 're joking ! Warden makes an angry exclamation . Why 're you telling me all this now ? Warden . Edward Warden Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know some one is watching you ! Some one who knows what you 've come to ! Some one who knows you ca n't resist temptation !

I did n't know you were particularly attached to Mrs. Hunter . Warden . Edward Warden I 'm not . Sterling . Richard Sterling Or to her two unmarried daughters ! Warden . Edward Warden Nor am I ! Sterling . Richard Sterling With whispered intensity . By God , if you are in love with my wife ! Warden . Edward Warden If you thought that out loud , I 'd knock you down ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Huh ! you talk as if you thought I were a coward ! Warden . Edward Warden No , not a physical coward  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a moral coward  --  yes , you are one ! Straight to him , standing close and looking him squarely in the eyes . Sterling . Richard Sterling Wavering . Oh , you 're too damned preachy ! Mrs. Hunter enters Right with Clara . Mrs. Hunter shakes hands with Warden silently , happy in the feeling that she is in great affliction , and satisfied with the appearance and impression she is making . She carries her handkerchief , with its black border , ready in her hand . Clara has silently shaken hands with Warden , after her mother . She afterwards goes to Sterling and hands him several of the letters of condolence . She then goes to the window at Left , pulling aside the curtain , and stands looking out , rather bored , wishing she could go out and take a walk . Mrs. Hunter .

Jordan steps into the room to announce the visitors , and seeing no one there , bows as the three pass him . Jordan . Jordan The ladies will be down at once . He goes out Right . The three turn , looking about the room with curiosity , as if the funeral might have made some difference in the house. , Miss Sillerton is a handsome , attractive woman , most fashionably dressed and perfectly conventional in character and intelligence . Miss Godesby is a little slow , more assertive , sharper of tongue , more acutely intelligent , and equally smartly dressed . She has still a remnant of real , sincere feeling buried under a cynical mask which her life in a fast set has developed for her self-preservation . Trotter is a foolish young person , meaning well enough according to his lights , which are not of the biggest and brightest . Trotter . Johnny Trotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter went to the most expensive decorator in town , and told him , no matter what it cost , to go ahead and do his worst !

Miss Godesby Yes , with your money and her cleverness , she 'll rubber neck you into the smartest push in town ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter You 've promised I shall know the whole classy lot before spring . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby So you will if you do as we tell you . But you must n't let society see that you know you 're getting in ; nothing pleases society so much as to think you 're a blatant idiot . It makes everybody feel you 're their equal  --  that 's why you get in . Trotter . Johnny Trotter I 've got a coach and can drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest private yacht in the world building .

Miss Sillerton How 'll we ever get the subject on to clothes ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Humph ! Do you think you can talk five minutes with Mrs. Hunter and not hit that topic ? It 's a bull 's eye ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter I do n't see where I 'm going to come into this classy conversation . Miss Godesby .

Johnny Trotter You two are Dodo birds ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I say , Eleanor , you 're such a lobster about prices and Mrs. Hunter 's no idiot , we 'd better agree on some sort of a signal ! Listen ! if you like a gown very much , ask the price , then say to me , " My dear , your hat pin is coming out .

" Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton All right . Mrs. Hunter and Clara enter Right . The manner of Miss Sillerton and Miss Godesby changes immediately . They speak with rather subdued voices , in the tone of conventional sympathy which is usually adopted on such occasions . Mrs. Hunter also assumes the manner of a martyr to grief . Clara is casual and hard . Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Shakes hands with Mrs. Hunter . Dear Mrs. Hunter . She kisses her . Clara , dear . She kisses her . Miss Godesby goes to Mrs. Hunter and shakes hands while Miss Sillerton crosses to Clara ; Trotter shakes hands with Mrs. Hunter as Miss Godesby goes to Clara . Trotter . Johnny Trotter I hope you do n't think my coming an intrusion . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Not at all . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I felt we must step in for a few minutes to give you our love and sympathy and find out how you are . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I 've been through a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever possibly imagine . Clara . Clara Hunter Who misinterprets her mother 's remark . Yes , indeed , I should say it was ! Mrs. Hunter stops her with a warning look . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter But every one has been most kind . Lady Hopeton sent me a beautiful long letter to-day . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby And I 'm glad to find you looking so well . Black suits you ! She exchanges a knowing glance with Miss Sillerton . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Oh , I do n't know , Julia ; I 've always thought black very trying for me . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , no ! every one 's saying just the reverse ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter But  --  I suppose clothes do n't interest you , Mr. Trotter ? Trotter . Johnny Trotter Oh , yes , they do , out of sight ! Clara . Clara Hunter Well , I wish you could have seen the beautiful things we brought over with us ! Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Julia and I were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our hearts . Miss Sillerton and Miss Godesby again exchange surreptitious glances . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Every one 's been most kind . There is an awkward pause for a moment , no one knowing quite what to say . Both Miss Godesby and Miss Sillerton have started the conversation in the direction of clothing and are fearful of the topic being changed . As the pause becomes embarrassing , they look helplessly from one to the other , and all five , suddenly and at once , make an ineffectual effort to say something  --  or nothing . Out of the general confusion Mrs. Hunter comes to the front , mistress of the situation . Are you going to stay in New York this winter , Mr. Trotter ? Trotter . Johnny Trotter Yes , I 'm negotiating for one of the biggest classy building plots on upper Fifth Avenue . Clara . Clara Hunter To Miss Godesby . I saw in the papers you were at the dance last night . Miss Godesby nods and motions surreptitiously to Trotter to go . He , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest again in life . Oh , were you ? What did you wear ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , dowdy old things . I have n't bought my winter frocks yet . She repeats this casually as if to herself . Miss Sillerton motions to Trotter to go , but he has forgotten and still does n't understand . Trotter . Johnny Trotter What ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby You warned us not to let you forget your engagement ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter What engagement ? Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton How do we know ! we only know you said you had to go ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter Never said so ! Oh ! As it dawns upon him . Oh , yes ! of course . He rises . Very sorry  --  must be off . Only dropped in  --  er  --  that is , came in to express my respectful sympathy . Shaking hands with Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Who rises . I hope you will come and see us again . Clara . Clara Hunter Do ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ditchwater here this winter ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter I shall be delighted to call again . Good-by . He bows to Clara . In his embarrassment he starts to shake hands all over again , but , realizing his mistake , laughs nervously . Oh , I have already . Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Good-by , Trotter . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Do n't forget we 're booked with you at Sherry 's . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Whose treat ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh ! Yours , of course  --  Trotter . Johnny Trotter I say , why ca n't I stay ? I wo n't interfere . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Oh , do stay , Mr. Trotter ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , do stay ! Suggesting by her tone that he must n't dare to remain . Clara . Clara Hunter Good ! Trotter remains , and they all settle themselves again for a long stay . Mrs. Hunter .

Miss Sillerton And even something of yours could be made over for us . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter But I 'm so much older than you ! Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Thoughtlessly . Yes , but you never dress appropriately to your age . Clara . Clara Hunter Laughing delightedly . That 's pretty good ! Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Saves herself . You know what I mean , you always look so youthful , you ca n't dress any older . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Rising .

If you remember , do n't tell what we paid  --  we ought to get nearly double out of these girls  --  and warn Tompson not to be surprised at anything she hears . Miss Godesby and Miss Sillerton exchange glances . Clara goes out Right . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter It seems as if I had no further interest in clothes , anyway . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Do n't say that . Every one I 've seen this afternoon is wildly enthusiastic over your mourning . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Well , I went straight to Madame O'Hoolihan and gave her carte blank ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I would n't like to be the ice man when your bill comes in !  --  and clothes abroad are so much cheaper . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Thoughtlessly . Oh , half ! Miss Godesby .

I told Marie to put it on , mama ; my clothes fit her perfectly , and I thought it would show so much better what it is . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Here they are . Rises as Tompson enters Right . Tompson . Tompson Mrs. Hunter 's reception gown . Displaying it . Clara . Clara Hunter Oh , this is a beauty ! She takes the costume and drapes it over a chair . Miss Godesby and Miss Sillerton come closer to examine . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Tompson.  --  Taking her to one side , whispers.  --  I forget ; do you remember what I paid for this dress ? Tompson . Tompson Whispers back . One hundred and sixty dollars , madam . Mrs. Hunter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Returning to the others . Do you like it ? Miss Sillerton .

I forget just what I paid for it , but I believe it was two hundred dollars . Clara half exclaims in astonishment , but on being pinched surreptitiously on the arm by Mrs. Hunter she grasps the situation and starts in to do her share . Clara . Clara Hunter Oh , no , mama ! I 'm sure it was more than that ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Well , perhaps it was two  --  twenty or two  --  twenty-five . Trotter . Joh nny Trotter That 's cheap , is n't it ? Miss Godesby .

Excuse me , I 'm quite tired out ; we 've been receiving a long visit of condolence . She goes out , Right , with Clara , who links her arm in her mother 's . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Finding the case , which has fallen beneath the table . Here it is . Dear old pocketbook  --  Her voice breaks on the last word , and turning her face away to hide her tears , she hands him the well-worn letter case . Warden . Edward Warden Mrs. Sterling , I 'm glad they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been able to manage it  --  to see you alone  --  and yet he wanted you only to examine these . They are private papers of Mr. Hunter ; he thought they ought not to be destroyed without being read , and yet he hesitated to read them . We thought that duty devolved best upon you . He hands back the letter case . Shall I wait and take back the case to Mr. Mason with the papers you wish him to have ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Oh , no , I will send them ; I must n't keep you while I read them . I 'm always taking more of your time than I ought . Warden . Edward Warden Speaks with sincerity , but without any suggestion of love-making . But never as much as I want to give you ! Do n't forget , Mrs. Sterling , what you promised me at your wedding ,  --  that your husband 's best man should be your best friend . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling And nobody knows what it means to a woman , even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight effort , as if she is persuading herself that she is a happily married woman.  --  to have an honest friend like you . It 's those people who have failed that say there is no such thing as a platonic friendship . Warden . Edward Warden We 'll prove them wrong . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling We will . Good-by , and thank you . Warden . Edward Warden And thank you ! Starting to go , he turns . Shall I bring that Russian pianist around to play for you some day next week ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Do  --  I want some music . Warden . Edward Warden Only let me know what day . He goes out Left . Blanche sits by the table and opens the case . She looks first at a memoranda and reads what is on the outside . A business memoranda . Lists of bonds . She opens and looks at the next paper only a second , and then closes it . This , Mr. Mason will understand better than I. She puts it back in the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My picture !  --  She looks for others , but finds none.  --  and only mine ! Oh , father ! ... She wipes away tears from her eyes so as to see the picture , which is an old one . Father , I returned your love . She reads on the back of photograph . " Blanche , my darling daughter , at fourteen years of age ! " That 's mine ! that 's my own ! And she puts the picture away separately . She takes up a small packet of very old love-letters tied with faded old pink tape . Old letters from mother ; they must be her love-letters . She shall have them ,  --  they may soften her . She takes up a slip of paper and reads on the outside . This is something for Mason , too . She puts it back in the case . She takes up a sealed envelope , blank . Nothing on it , and sealed . She looks at it a moment , thinking . Father , did you want this opened ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I need n't be afraid ; you had nothing to hide from the world . Tearing it open , she reads . " I have discovered my son-in-law , Richard Sterling , in irregular business dealing . He is not honest . I will watch him as long as I live ; but when you read this , Mason , keep your eye upon him for my daughter 's sake . He has been warned by me  --  he may never trip again , and her happiness lies in ignorance . " She starts , and looks about her to make sure she is alone . She then sits staring ahead for a few seconds ; then she speaks . My boy 's father dishonest ! Disgrace  --  he owned it  --  threatening my boy ! It must n't come ! It must n't ! I 'll watch now . She goes to the fireplace , tearing the paper as she crosses the room , she burns the letter ; then she gathers up the other letters and the pocket case . He must give me his word of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to ever make the boy ashamed of bearing his father 's name ! She watches to see that every piece of the paper burns , as The Curtain Falls ACT II Christmas Eve ; fourteen months later ; the dining room of the Hunters ' house , which is now lived in jointly by the Sterlings and Mrs. Hunter and her daughters . It is a dark wainscoted room , with curtains of crimson brocade . It is decorated with laurel roping , mistletoe , and holly , for Christmas . It is the end of a successful dinner party , fourteen happy and more or less congenial persons being seated at a table , as follows : Warden , Ruth , Mason , Clara , Trotter , Mrs. Hunter , Blanche , Sterling , Miss Sillerton , Mr. Godesby , Jessica , Doctor Steinhart , and Miss Godesby , The room is dark on all sides , only a subdued light being shed on the table by two large , full candelabra with red shaded candles . As the curtain rises the bare backs of the three women nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetmeats are being passed by four men servants , including Jordan and Leonard . Ruth . Ruth My dear Blanche , what delicious candy ! Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Is n't it ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Half of the candy offered one nowadays seems made of papier-mch . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter To Miss Godesby . Julia , do tell me how Mr. Tomlins takes his wife 's divorce ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby He takes it with a grain of salt ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter But is n't he going to bring a counter suit ? Sterling . Richard Sterling No . Ruth . Ruth I hope not . I am an old-fashioned woman and do n't believe in divorce ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Really ! But then you 're not married ! Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton What is the reason for so much divorce nowadays ? Ruth . Ruth Marriage is the principal one . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I do n't believe in divorce , either . Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton My dear , no woman married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trotter . Johnny Trotter You people are all out of date ! More people get divorced nowadays than get married . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Too many people do  --  that 's the trouble . I meant what I said when I was married  --  " for better , for worse , till death us do part . "  --  What is the opera Monday ? Trotter . Johnny Trotter Something of Wagner 's . He 's a Dodo bird ! Bores me to death ! Not catchy enough music for me . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter You 'd adore him if you went to Bayreuth . Which was that opera , Clara , we heard at Bayreuth last summer ? Was it Faust or Lohengrin ! They play those two so much here I 'm always getting them mixed ! Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Wagner did n't write Faust ! Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Did n't he ? I thought he had ; he 's written so many operas the last few seasons ! Clara . Clara Hunter I like Tannhuser , because as soon as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , you can cheer up and think of your wraps and fur boots . Trotter . Johnny Trotter My favorite operas are San Toy and the Roger Brothers , though I saw Florodora thirty-six times ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Mother would have gone with you every one of those thirty-six Florodora times . She 's not really fond of music . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Not fond of music ! Did n't I have an opera box for four years ? Trotter . Johnny Trotter Why does n't Conned make some arrangement with Weber and Fields and introduce their chorus into Faust and Carmen ? Dr. Steinhart . Dr. Steinart Great idea ! To Miss Godesby . Did you get a lot of jolly presents ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Not half bad , especially two fine French bulls ! All are laughing and talking together . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling What did you get , Mr. Warden ? Warden . Edward Warden Three copies of " David Harum , " two umbrellas , and a cigar case too short for my cigars . Miss Godesby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edward Warden It 's too long for cigarettes . Then I had something that 's either a mouchoir or a handkerchief case , or for neckties , or shaving papers , or something or other . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Yes , I know , I got one of those , too . Dr. Steinhart . Dr. Steinart So did I ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I must start the women ; we are coming back here to arrange a surprise for you men . She nods her head in signal to Sterling , and rises . All rise . Sterling . Richard Sterling One moment please . One toast on Christmas night ! Ned , give us a toast . All the Women . All the Women But not in unison . Oh , yes ! A toast ! Ad lib . Warden . Edward Warden Holding up his glass . Here 's to those whom we love ! And to those who love us ! And to those who love those whom we love And to those who love those who love us ! All the Men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Bully toast ! Ad lib . Every one drinks . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling One more toast , Dick . To the others . Christmas Day is our boy 's birthday . Ruth .

All the women speak their next speeches at the same time . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Laughing . Of course ! I 've dropped my handkerchief . Ned dives under the took for it . Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton O dear , my fan ! All together Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby What a bore ! I 've dropped a glove ! All together Steinhart goes under the table for it . Clara .

Mrs. Hunter Dick , please , I 've dropped my smelling bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Ruth . Ruth My gloves , please , I 'm so sorry ! All together Mason goes under the table for them . The speeches of the women are simultaneous , followed by the movements of the men also , all at the same time . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Please do n't bother ; the servants  --  Leonard , Jordan , and two extra men start to hunt under the table , too . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Women ought to have everything they own fastened to them with rubberneck elastics . The men , somewhat flustered , all rise with the various articles , and offer them to their respective owners . All the women thank the men profusely , and apologize at the same time . Sterling takes Mrs. Hunter out at back , followed by all the other couples , all talking . Ruth and Mason lag behind . Ruth . Ruth To Blanche , who with Warden waits for Ruth and Mason to pass . I want just a minute with Mr. Mason , Blanche . Blanche and Warden pass out before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were carrying on a conversation that had been interrupted . She speaks in a lowered voice , indicating the private nature of what she has to say . I sent him imperative word yesterday I must have the bonds . I told him I wanted one to give to his wife for Christmas . He pretends to-day he did n't receive this letter , but he must have . Mason . Frederick Mason This makes the third time there has been some excuse for not giving you the bonds ? Ruth . Ruth Yes , and this letter he says he did n't get was sent to his office by hand . Mason . Frederick Mason I 'll speak to him before I leave . They go out at back . As they pass out , Jordan stands by the doorway holding the curtains back . The other three men stand stiffly at the Right . As Mason and Ruth go out , the Servants relax and exchange glances , each giving a little laugh out loud , except Jordan . During the following dialogue they empty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jordan . Jordan Sh ! A very dull dinner , not an interesting word spoke . First Footman . First Footman The widder seemed chipper like ! Leonard .

He goes out Right . To Leonard . Get the smoking lay-out ! Leonard goes out Right and brings back a silver tray laden with cigarettes , cigar boxes , and a burning alcohol lamp . Leonard . Leonard If you ask me , I think she 's going to put a bit more on the matrimonial mare if she gets the chance . Jordan . Jordan It 's none of your business . You 're Mrs. Sterling 's servant now . Leonard . Leonard Good thing , too ; it was a happy day for us when they moved in . First Footman . First Footman Renters with the coffee . Say , did you see how that young feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table. shovelled the food in ? Leonard . Leonard And the way he poured down the liquid  --  regular hog ! My arm 's tired a-filling of his glass . And he drinks a glass of champagne which has been left untouched by a guest . Jordan . Jordan He ai n't nobody ; he has n't any money ; he was just asked to fill up . He 's one of these yere singing chaps what 's asked to pass the time after dinner with a song or two gratis . This dinner 'll last him for food for a week ! Their manners suddenly change as the men renter and take seats about the two ends of the table . Sterling , Mason , and Doctor down Left form one group . The other men are in a group between the window and the other end . On entering Sterling speaks . Sterling . Rich ard Sterling Jordan , for heaven 's sake , give us something to see by ! You ca n't tell which end of your cigar to light in this confounded woman 's candle-light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of Welsbachs ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter Bright idea , Sterling . Sterling , laughing , joins his group , who laugh gently with him . Jordan turns on the electric light . The servants pass the coffee , liqueurs , and the cigars and cigarettes . Meanwhile the following dialogue takes place , the men beginning to talk at once on their entrance . Sterling . Richard Sterling Mr. Mason , I 'd like to ask your honest opinion on something if you 'll give it me . Mason . Frederick Mason Certainly . Sterling . Richard Sterling This Hudson Electric Company . Dr. Steinhart . Dr. Steinart Oh ! Dropped fearfully to-day . Sterling . Richard Sterling But that can happen easily with the best thing . To-morrow  --  Mason . Frederick Mason Interrupting . To-morrow it will drop to its very bottom ! Sterling . Richard Sterling I do n't believe it . Dr. Sreinhart . Dr. Steinart Surely , Mr. Mason , the men who floated that are too clever to ruin themselves . Mason . Fre derick Mason They 're out of it . Sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason They got out last week quietly . Sterling . Richard Sterling But  --  Mason . Frederick Mason Mark my words , the day after to-morrow there 'll be several foolish people ruined , and not one of the promoters of that company will lose a penny ! Sterling . Richard Sterling I do n't believe it ! The crowd at the other end of the table , who have been listening to a tale from Trotter , laugh heartily . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Delighted with his success . I 'm no Dodo bird ! Warden leaves this group casually and joins the other . Mason . Frederick Mason To Sterling . Do n't tell me you 're in it ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Ugly . Yes , I am in it ! Mason . Frederick Mason Not much ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Yes , much ! Warden . Edward Warden Much what ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Oh , nothing ; we were just discussing stocks . Warden . Edward Warden And up there they 're discussing Jeffreys and Fitzsimmons . Mason . Frederick Mason Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I defy any broker to produce one customer who can show a profit after three consecutive years of speculation . Sterling . Richard Sterling Oh , you 're too conservative ; nothing venture , nothing have . Excuse me , I think Jeffreys and Fitzsimmons more amusing topics . Come along . Sterling and Dr. Steinhart join the other group Right . Mason . Frederick Mason To Warden . You 're Sterling 's broker . Warden . Edward Warden No , not for over a year . Mason . Frederick Mason Then you ca n't tell me how deep he is in this Hudson Electric swindle ? Warden . Edward Warden Is he in it at all ? Mason . Frederick Mason Yes , he says , deep . Warden . Edward Warden I suspected it yesterday . Mason . Frederick Mason But what with  --  his wife 's money ? Warden . Edward Warden That went fourteen months ago . I put him on his feet then , gave him some tips that enabled him to take this house with her mother , so that with his regular law business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living could not leave one cent over to speculate with . Mason . Frederick Mason To himself . Good God ! Warden . Edward Warden I know what you 're afraid of . Mason . Frederick Mason No ! Warden . Edward Warden Yes . The reason I 'm no longer his broker is he was ashamed to let me know about his dealings . Mason . Frederick Mason But you do n't mean you think he 'd actually steal ! Warden . Edward Warden His aunt 's money ? Why not ? He did his wife 's ! Mason . Frederick Mason Does he handle any one else 's affairs ? Warden . Edward Warden I know he takes care of that Godesby woman 's property . Mason . Frederick Mason And she would n't hold her tongue if a crash came ! Warden . Edward Warden Not for a minute ! Is Miss Hunter suspicious ? Mason . Frederick Mason Yes . Does Sterling realize that to-morrow he will most probably be a ruined cheat ? Warden . Edward Warden Very likely . Mason . Frederick Mason If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he might do  --  what ? Warden . Edward Warden Run away with whatever money he has left , or kill himself . I do n't know if he 's enough of a coward for that or not . There 's one hold on him  --  he loves his wife . Mason . Frederick Mason Which will make him all the more ashamed of discovery . Do you believe she suspects ? Warden . Edward Warden Not a bit . She loves him too dearly . Mason . Frederick Mason Can we do anything ? Warden . Edward Warden Nothing but watch him closely till the people Then force him to make a clean breast of it , so we can all know where we stand ; how we can best protect his aunt from ruin and his wife and boy from public disgrace . Mason . Frederick Mason He is watching us . Warden . Edward Warden He knows I know him ; we must be careful . He 's coming toward us . He then speaks in a different tone , but no louder . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick Mason Absolutely . Every man left in that concern will be ruined before the ' Change closes after to-morrow . Sterling has joined them in time to hear the end of Mason 's speech . Mason continues . I am telling Warden what I told you about the Hudson Electric Company . Sterling . Richard Sterling Ca n't you talk of something pleasanter ? Blanche renters at back . On her entrance all the men rise . The servants finish preparing the room for the tree . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I 'm very sorry  --  I really ca n't let you men stay here any longer . All the Men . All the Men Why not ? How 's that ? Ad lib . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling You know we want to get this room ready for Santa Claus ! Dick ! She goes to her husband . All the men go out at back in a group led by Warden and Mason . They are all talking and laughing . Blanche is left alone with her husband . What is this Aunt Ruth has been telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Oh , nothing . I forgot to send them up to her , that 's all . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling But she says she sent three times . Sterling .

Sterling . Richard Sterling What if I had ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I would let the law take its course . Sterling . Richard Sterling You must love me very little . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I live with you . First you robbed me of my respect for you ; then you dried up my heart with neglect . Sterling . Richard Sterling And our boy ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Your blood runs in his veins ; your shame and disgrace would be a fearful warning to him . It might kill me ; but never mind , if it saved him . Sterling .

The women are heard singing " Follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sterling . Richard Sterling Be quick , and say nothing to any one . Leonard . Leonard Yes , sir . He goes out quickly Right . Sterling goes up stage and stands beside the door at back as the women dance in , singing " Follow the Man from Cook 's . " They are led by Clara , with Mrs. Hunter on the end . Blanche and Ruth follow alone , not dancing . The others dance around the chairs and Clara jumps on and off one of them ; this stops the rest , who balk at it . Sterling goes out at back . The Servants enter Right . Clara . Clara Hunter I do n't care for this dinner party at all . The women are all the time being chased away from the men ! I prefer being with Mr. Trotter . Do n't you , mama ? Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton He does n't seem able to give a dinner party any more without you to chaperone , Mrs. Hunter . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Mother , how can you ? Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it 's chaperoning ! I like Mr. Trotter very much . Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton But he 's such a little cad . I tried to give him a lift , but he was too heavy for me . Clara . Clara Hunter Oh , well , you ought just to pretend it 's the money in his pocket makes him so heavy ; then you 'd find him dead easy . Meanwhile the Servants have arranged the table , taken out the extra leaves and made it square , and left the room . They now renter , bringing in a gorgeously decorated and lighted Christmas tree . There is at once a loud chorus of delighted approval from the women . The Servants place the tree in the centre of the table . The women who are sitting rise and come near to examine the tree . Ruth . Ruth What a beautiful tree , Blanche ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling The boy is to have it to-morrow morning  --  it 's really his tree ! Tompson brings in a large basket containing seven small stockings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small socks . They are made of bright and different colors and are stuffed into absurd , bulgy shapes . There 's a name on each one . Come along now ! Taking out a little sock . The women crowd around the basket and each hangs a sock on the tree , Miss Godesby and Clara standing on chairs . Clara . Clara Hunter Reading the name on her sock . Oh ! mine 's for Mr. Mason . What 's in it , Blanche ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I really ca n't tell you . I asked the clerk where I bought it what it was for , and he said he did n't know ; it was a " Christmas present . " Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Laughing . Oh , I know the kind ! Mine 's for Howard Godesby . What 's his present ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling A silver golf marker . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby But he does n't play golf ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Well , he ought to ; it 'll keep him young . Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julia ! You can give it away to some one next Christmas . Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton What 's in Mr. Trotter 's ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Oh , that present has almost been my death ! Men are so hard to find things for ! I had put in a gold pencil for his key chain , but to-night while we were eating our oysters , I saw him show a beauty that his mother had given him this morning ! So I whispered to Jordan between the soup and fish to change Mr. Ryder 's name to Mr. Trotter 's stocking , and put Mr. Trotter 's name on the one that had a cigarette case in it . I sneaked a message down to Dick on my dinner card  --  was it all right ?  --  and he sent back word during the game that Trotter only smoked cigars ; so before the ices were passed I shuffled Mr. Trotter 's and Mr. Mason 's names ,  --  I 'd given Mason the cigar case ;  --  and just as Jordan signalled to me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe he 'd been obliged to give up smoking entirely  --  doctor 's orders ! They laugh punctiliously , rather bored by Blanche 's long account . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter Is n't the tree stunning ? Clara . Clara Hunter Getting down from her chair . It makes the table look like one of Mr. Trotter 's " informal little dinners . " Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby They say he has one of those men who arrange shop windows decorate his dinner table for him ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling The only time I ever dined with him I was really ashamed to go home with my dinner favor  --  it was so gorgeous ! And there were such big bunches of violets in the finger bowls there was n't room for your little finger . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby You never saw such a lot of decoration ! The game have ribbon garters on their legs , and even the raw oysters wear corsage bouquets ! To Mrs. Hunter . I hope you do n't mind what we 're saying , Mrs. Hunter ? Mrs. Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind very much .  --  A pause.  --  because  --  A second pause.  --  well , I am going to marry Mr. Trotter  --  All , not believing her , laugh merrily . You are all very rude ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Not on the level ! Not Trotter ! Miss Sillerton . Miss Sillerton Not really ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling No , no , of course not ! She rings bell . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter But I am ! And I thought here at my daughter 's table , among my own friends ( I was allowed to name the guests to-night ) , I could count on good wishes and congratulations . There is a dead silence The musicians , a band of Neapolitan players , enter and take their places in a recess at Left . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling To the musicians . You may play . To Jordan , who has brought in the Neapolitans . We are ready , Jordan . Jordan goes out at back . Ruth goes to Blanche . The guitars and mandolins begin a popular song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , well , Mrs. Hunter , we were only codding ! There 's lots of good in Trotter , and I 'm sure you 'll bring it out . Good luck ! Shaking her hand . Ruth . Ruth To Blanche , aside . You wo n't allow this ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Certainly not . Blanche crosses to her mother and they go to one side together ; Blanche speaks in a lowered voice . You 've amazed and shocked me ! I will not tolerate such a thing ; we 'll talk it over to-night . She leaves her and returns to her guests , Mrs. Hunter standing where she is left , biting her lips and almost crying with rage and mortification . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Before the musicians , to Blanche as she joins her . I 'm crazy about these men , Mrs. Sterling ; they play so awfully well  --  especially that one with the lovely legs ! Jordan pulls aside the curtains at back and all the men renter except Warden . They all join hands and dance around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go up to a side table , where everything to drink is displayed . Warden enters at this moment and motions to Mason and leads him down stage . Warden . Edward Warden There was a railway guide in the hall  --  that 's what he went there for ; he 's going to run away to-night . Mason . Frederick Mason How 'll we prevent it ? Warden . Edward Warden First , we must break up this party ! Mason . Frederick Mason How ? Warden . Edward Warden I have n't quite thought yet . Go back to the others ; send Jordan to me ; do n't lose sight of Dick . Jordan ! He takes him aside . I want you to go out of this room for a minute , pretend to go upstairs , then come back and tell Mrs. Sterling , loud enough for the others to hear you , that Master Richard is very ill , and say the maid is frightened . Jordan . Jordan Hesitating . But  --  Warden . Edward Warden Quickly and firmly . Do as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan goes out at back . The men and women are laughing and talking about the sideboard . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Come now , everybody ! Let 's have the presents . Dick , you know you are to be Santa Claus . Sterling looks nervously at his watch . Sterling . Richard Sterling Just a minute , dear ! Ned ! Takes Warden to one side . The women move about the tree , hunting for their own names on the stockings on the table at the foot of the tree . Ned , I 've been suddenly called out of town on business  --  must catch the eleven-twenty train . I do n't want to break up the party , so you empty the tree , and when the time comes for me to go , I 'll slip out . Warden . Edward Warden And when your guests go ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Oh , then you can explain for me . Jordan enters at back . Jordan . Jordan To Blanche . Beg pardon , madam , but Master Richard is very ill . Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ma'am , and Droves is very frightened , ma'am . Ruth . Ruth Richard ill ? All give exclamations of surprise and regret and sympathy . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling My little boy ill ? Excuse me , I must go to him . She hurries out at back . Ruth speaks to the musicians , who stop playing . Sterling . Richard Sterling Moved . My boy ill  --  why , I ca n't  --  I ca n't  --  Warden . Edward Warden " Ca n't " what ? Sterling . Richard Sterling How can I go away ? Warden . Edward Warden Surely you wo n't let business take you away from your boy who may be dying . Sterling . Richard Sterling No ! I wo n't got I 'll face it out ! I ca n't leave my boy like this  --  Ruth . Ruth Com ing to Sterling . I 'm going to take these women away ; tell Blanche not to give them a thought . Their evening up to now has been charming . During Ruth 's speech , Warden has spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason . Do n't let Miss Hunter go . Ruth . Ruth To the other guests . Come to the drawing-room . Mrs. Hunter . Mrs. Hunter I was crazy to see what was in my stocking . All pass out talking , expressing conventional sympathy on account of Richard , but evidently resenting the breaking up of the party . Sterling and Warden are left alone in the room . Sterling moves to go up to back ; Warden interrupts him . Warden . Edward Warden To Sterling . Where are you going ? Sterling . Richard Sterling To my boy and my wife . Warden . Edward Warden Wait a minute ; I want to speak to you . Sterling . Richard Sterling Speak to me later ; I ca n't wait now . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Off stage , at back , excitedly . Jordan ! She enters , excited , half hysterical . Jordan ! Where is Jordan ? It was a lie ! What did he mean ? Richard is sleeping sweetly . The maid knows nothing of being alarmed ! Where is Jordan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edward Warden Stops her . Mrs. Sterling , he had nothing to do with it ! I told Jordan to say what he said . Blanche turns and looks at Warden in astonishment . Sterling . Ri chard Sterling Stunned and at once suspicious . What ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling But  --  Warden . Edward Warden Forgive me for so cruelly alarming you ; it was the only way I could think of for getting rid at once of your guests ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Angry . You 'll interfere once too often in the affairs of this house . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Indignant . But what excuse can you make , Mr. Warden ? Warden . Edward Warden Will you be so good as to ask Miss Hunter and Mr. Mason to come here ? They will explain what I have done , partly , and your husband will tell you the rest when you come back . Sterling sneers aloud . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I do n't understand , I do n't understand . She goes out at back . Sterling . Richard Sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warden . Edward Warden Good ! That spares me a very disagreeable speech . Sterling . Richard Sterling No , it does n't ! Come out with it ! What is it you want ? What is it you 've found out ? Warden . Edward Warden From betraying a trust , you 've come , in less than two years , to an outright embezzlement . Sterling . Richard Sterling Speak out  --  give us facts ! Warden . Edward Warden You 've stolen your aunt 's fortune . Sterling . Richard Sterling Prove that ! Warden . Edward Warden It 's her money that 's lost in the Hudson Electric Company ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Prove it ! Warden . Edward Warden Easy enough , to-morrow . Sterling . Richard Sterling You 've got to excuse your action to-night or be kicked out of my house ! Warden . Edward Warden Strong . Is n't what I say the truth ? Sterling . Richard Sterling Equally strong . No ! And now get out ! Warden . Edward Warden Looks at his watch . I 'll not leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that eleven-twenty . Sterling . Richard Sterling More ugly . Yes , you will and mighty  --  Warden . Edward Warden No , I 'll not ! He is interrupted by the entrance of Blanche , Ruth , and Mason . Warden . Edward Warden To Blanche . I hope you forgive me now  --  Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Pathetically . You did right ; I thank you . Sterling . Richard Sterling Heartbroken . Blanche  --  without hearing a word from me ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling No , I 've come now to hear what you have to say . A deep-toned clock strikes eleven . Sterling , at the second stroke , takes out his watch with a hurried movement . Warden . Edward Warden Quickly . Eleven o'clock . Sterling . Richard Sterling I wish Warden to leave the room . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Firmly . And I wish him to stay . A short pause . Sterling . Richard Sterling Well , of what am I accused ? Warden . Edward Warden Nobody wants to accuse you . We want you to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you talk to me ; let my wife do the talking if you want me to answer . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Sit down , Aunt Ruth . Ruth sits by the table , Warden stands at back . Sterling stands at Right and Blanche and Mason sit near the centre . Aunt Ruth asks you to give her a true account of her trust in you . Mr. Mason is here as her friend and my father 's . Sterling . Richard Sterling I have n't said I betrayed her trust . I told her she should have the bonds she wants to-morrow . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling But will she ? That 's what I want to know . I ask you if you have n't her bonds , to tell us here now ,  --  tell us , who have been and must be still the best friends , perhaps the only friends , you can have . Tell us where we all stand  --  are we the only ones to suffer or are there others who will perhaps be less generous in their treatment of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save us from public scandal , from the disgrace which would stamp your wife as the wife of a thief , and send your boy out into the world the son of a convict cheat . She breaks down , but in a moment controls herself . There is no answer . Sterling sinks into a chair , his arms on the table , his head on his arms . A moment 's silence . You love me  --  I know that . I appeal to your love ; let your love of me persuade you to do what I ask . I ask it for your sake and for mine ! Tell us here the truth now  --  it will spare me much to-morrow , perhaps  --  me whom you love  --  for love of me  --  Sterling . Richard Sterling In an agony . I 'm afraid I 'll lose you  --  Blanche . Mrs. Sterling No , I 'll promise to stand by you if you 'll only tell us all the Ruth . Sterling . Richard Sterling In a low , shamed voice . I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Blanche looks up questioningly to Mason . Mason shakes his head . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling It must be now , Dick . Sterling . Richard Sterling No ! no ! I ca n't look you in the face and tell it ! Let me tell it to you alone , later , in the dark . Blanche looks up questioningly to Mason . He shakes his head . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling It must be now . Sterling . Richard Sterling No , no , I 'm too ashamed , I ca n't face you ; in the dark I 'll make a clean breast of it  --  let me tell you in the dark . Warden moves and puts his hand on the electric-light button beside the doorway at back . Warden . Edward Warden In the dark , then , tell it ! He presses the button and all the lights go out . The stage is in complete darkness ; only the voices are heard from the different places in which the actors are last seen . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Quickly . Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Go on . Sterling . Richard Sterling It began fourteen months ago , after Ned Warden put me on my feet ; I got a little ahead  --  why not get way ahead ? There were plenty of men around me making their fortunes ! I wanted to equal them  --  climb as high as they ; it seemed easy enough for them , and luck had begun to come my way . We 're all climbers of some sort in this world . I was a climber after wealth and everything it brings  --  He stops a moment . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Her voice comes throbbing with pathetic emotion through the darkness . And I after happiness and all it brings . Sterling . Richard Sterling Deeply moved , his voice trembles for a moment , but only for a moment . Do n't , Blanche , or I ca n't finish . Well , I borrowed on some of Aunt Ruth 's bonds and speculated  --  I made a hundred thousand in a week ! I put back the bonds . But it had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the iron side of the vault box . They seemed to smile and beckon , to beg me to take them out into the air again ! They grew to be like living things to me , servants of mine to get me gold  --  and finally I determined to make one bigger coup than ever ! I took Aunt Ruth 's bonds out and all the money available in my trust , and put it all into this new company ! It seemed so safe . I stood to be a prince among the richest ! And , for a day or so , I 've known nothing short of a miracle could save me from being wanted by the police ! To-night I gave up even the miracle . That 's all . It 's no use saying I 'm sorry . A moment 's pause . Mason . Frederick Mason Have others suffered besides Miss Hunter ? Sterling . Richard Sterling There is some money of Aunt Ruth 's left  --  stock I could n't transfer . But I used the money of others  --  Miss Godesby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a large part of your fortune is gone , used unlawfully by this man . Will you resort to the law ? Ruth . Ruth Very quietly . No ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling In a voice broken with emotion and gratitude . Aunt Ruth ! Mason . Frederick Mason We ca n't hope Miss Godesby and Ryder will be as lenient ! You must go to them in the morning  --  tell them everything , put yourself at their mercy , ask for time and their silence . Sterling . Richard Sterling Never ! I could n't do it Mason . Frederick Mason It is the only honorable way out of your dishonorable action  --  the least you can do ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Confess to their faces , and probably to no good ? Eat the dust at their feet , and most likely be clapped into prison for it ? No , thank you ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Suppose I went to them ? Sterling . Richard Sterling You ? Ruth . Ruth No ! Why should you ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I would do it for my boy 's sake . Yes , I 'll go . Sterling . Richard Sterling Yes ! You go , Blanche . Ruth . Ruth No , you sha n't go  --  you sha n't humiliate yourself in his place ! Mason . Frederick Mason Certainly not ; and if your husband is willing , we are not willing ! He must go . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling But if he wo n't ? Mason . Frederick Mason He must ! Ruth . Ruth You must demand his going , Blanche , and I demand it , too , as something due to me . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Very well . I demand it . Will you go ? A moment 's silence . Warden . Edward Warden Why do n't you speak ? He presses the electric button and all the lights come on . Sterling is at the doorway at back , about to steal out . There is an exclamation aloud from all of surprise and disgust . The clock strikes the quarter ; Warden catches hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There goes the quarter hour ; you could never catch the eleven-twenty . Sterling . Richard Sterling Damn you ! Facing Warden squarely , as The Curtain Falls Quickly ACT III At " The Hermitage , " on the Bronx River , the next afternoon . The house is on the Left , and on the Right and at the back are the green lattice arches . Snow lies thick everywhere , on the benches at the Right and on the little iron table beside it , on the swing between two trees at the Right , in the red boxes of dead shrubs , on the rocks and dried grass of a " rookery " in the centre , and on the branches of the trees . Clara comes out from the house , followed by Trotter . Clara . Clara Hunter Come on and let mama rest awhile  --  naturally she 's excited and tired out , being married so suddenly and away from home . She stops beside the swing , taking held of its side rope with her hand . It is n't every mother who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her youngest daughter for a bridesmaid . Laughing . Trotter . Jo hnny Trotter I hope Mrs. Sterling will forgive me . Perhaps she will when she sees how my money can help your mother and me to get right in with all the smarties ! Clara . Clara Hunter Oh , do n't you be too sure about your getting in ; it is n't as easy as the papers say ! But , anyway , that would n't make any difference to Blanche . She was never a climber like mama and me . I suppose that 's why she is asked to all sorts of houses through Aunt Ruth that would n't let mama and me even leave our cards on the butler ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter I thought your mother could go anywhere she liked . Clara . Clara Hunter Oh , no , she could n't ! if she made you think that , it was only a jolly ! Blanche is the only one of us who really went everywhere . Come along , " Poppa " give me a swing ! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow from the seat of the swing with her hand . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Your mother certainly did represent  --  Clara . Clara Hunter Sitting in the swing . Oh , well , now do n't blame mama ! She could n't help herself ; she always thought you dreadfully handsome ! Swing me ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter I do n't care , anyway . I 'm deucedly proud of your mother ,  --  I mean of my wife ,  --  and I 'd just as lief throw up the whole society business and go off and live happily by ourselves . Clara . Clara Hunter O dear ! I think mama would find that awfully dull . Go on , swing me ! Trotter swings her . Of course , you 'll find mama a little different when you see her all the time . You really wo n't see much more of her , though , than you do now . She does n't get up till noon , and has her masseuse for an hour every morning , her manicure and her mental science visitor every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ! She has to lie down a lot , too , but you must n't mind that ; you must remember she is n't our age ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter Swings her . She suits me ! Clara . Clara Hunter That 's just what I feel ! You 'll take care of her , and me , too , all our lives , and that 's what makes me so happy . I 'm full of plans ! We 'll go abroad soon and stay two years . He has stopped swinging her . Go on , swing me ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter Holding the swing still . Say ! if you think you are going to run me and the whole family , you 're a Dodo bird ! Remember that you 're my daughter ; you must wait a little it you want to be a mother-in-law . Sleigh-bells are heard in the distance , coming nearer . Clara . Clara Hunter Good gracious ! If you ask me , I think mama has got her hands full . What 's become of Miss Godesby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went upstairs with your mother , they went down the road . Clara . Clara Hunter You know originally the idea was I was to marry you . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Really  --  Clara . Clara Hunter Laughingly . Yes , and mama cut me out . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Oh , well , it ca n't be helped ; we ca n't marry everybody . Clara . Clara Hunter Noticing the bells . Somebody else arriving ! That 's queer  --  nobody comes here in the winter ; that 's why we chose it , because it would be quiet ! Let 's play this game . Going to an iron frog on a box which stands near the house . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Perhaps it 's Mrs. Sterling . Clara . Clara Hunter No ; if she was coming at all , she 'd have come in time for the wedding . She takes up the disks which lie beside the frog . I should hate to get married like you and mama  --  no splurge and no presents ! Why , the presents 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 've given in your life , and have lost now a good chance of getting back . Throws a disk into the frog 's open mouth . Trotter . Johnny Trotter I 'll give your mother all the presents she wants . I can afford it ; I do n't want anybody to give us anything ! Clara . Clara Hunter You talk like Jess ! Throws another disk . You know Jess earns her own living . She goes around to smart women 's houses answering their invitations and letters for ' em . She calls it being a visiting secretary , but I tell her she 's a co-respon-dent ! Throws a disk . Warden and Mason enter from behind the house quickly , with a manner of suppressed excitement . They are surprised to find Clara and Trotter . Warden . Edward Warden Why , here they are ! Mason . Frederick Mason No , only Miss Clara and Trotter . Warden . Edward Warden Lucky I met you  --  you must take me back in your sleigh . Mason . Frederick Mason Yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , were you invited ? Clara . Clara Hunter Merry Christmas ! Warden . Edward Warden We came to see the Godesbys . Clara . Clara Hunter They 've gone down the road . Mason . Frederick Mason Sterling is n't here , is he ? Trotter .

Freder ick Mason Yes  --  er  --  er  --  a  --  many happy returns , Mr. Trotter . Trotter . Johnny Trotter It 's a great day for me , Mr. Mason ! Warden . Edward Warden Wish you joy , Trotter ! Embarrassed and not going near him . Trotter rushes eagerly to him and grasps his hand warmly . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Thank you , old man ! I say ! Thank you ! Mason . Frederick Mason Miss Clara , would you do me the great favor of going down the road and hurrying the Godesbys back if you see them ? Clara . Clara Hunter Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warden .

Edward Warden To Mason . Will you see Mrs. Hunter ? Trotter . Johnny Trotter I beg your pardon , Mrs. Trotter ! Warden . Edward Warden Politely . I beg yours . To Mason . See Mrs. Trotter . Mason . Frederick Mason Aside to Warden . You 're going to ask him to go on Dick 's note for Ryder ? Warden . Edward Warden In a low voice . Yes . Mason . Frederick Mason You 're a wonder ! As if he would ! Warden . Edward Warden Somebody must , and there 's nobody else . That boy and that mother have got to be saved ! Mason . Frederick Mason I 'm sorry my name 's no good for us . Warden . Edward Warden And mine must n't be used . Mason . Frederick Mason No , indeed ! The minute that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble would tumble down on Mrs. Sterling 's head . Good luck . Shakes his hand and enters the house . Trotter . Johnny Trotter What 's up ? You have n't come to kick about my wedding , have you ? I would n't stand for that , you know ! Warden . Edward Warden It 's not that , Mr. Trotter . Your wife 's son-in-law , Sterling , has turned out a blackguard ; he has had intrusted to him Miss Ruth Hunter 's money and several other people 's , and he 's used it all for speculation of his own . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Then he 's a damned thief ! He sits on the bench with the manner that he has settled the subject . Warden . Edward Warden So he is , and he 's ruined . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Well , prison is the place for him . Warden . Edward Warden We wo n't argue that , but how about his family  --  they get punished for what he has done ; they must share his disgrace . Trotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of all that now  --  she 's Mrs. Trotter . Warden . Edward Warden Yes , but her own daughter suffers . Trotter . Johnny Trotter On the defensive .

Johnny Trotter She 's always snubbed me right and left , but , by George , I must own she is a fine woman . Warden . Edward Warden That 's right ! Clapping him on the back and putting his arm around his shoulder . Look here  --  help us save her ! Trotter . Johnny Trotter How ? Warden . Edward Warden Indorse a note of Sterling 's to give Ryder to keep him quiet . Trotter . Johnny Trotter I 'd have to ask my wife . Warden . Edward Warden No ! Do n't start off like that !

Trotter . Johnny Trotter Where 's my security ? Warden . Edward Warden I can get you security if you want it . Trotter . Johnny Trotter Of course I want it ! And I say , where are you ? Why are n't you in it ? Warden . Edward Warden There are reasons why my name had better not appear ; you are in the family . But I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Trotter ; I 'll secure you with a note of my own  --  only you must keep it dark ; you must n't even let Mason know . Trotter .

What I wanted was style and position , and some one classy who would know how to spend my money for me ! Warden . Edward Warden Well , you 've got that , surely ! Clara comes back from the house . Clara . Clara Hunter The Godesbys are coming . Trotter , there 's skating on the river near here , and they 've skates in the house  --  do n't you want a spin ? Trotter . Johnny Trotter Yes , I do n't mind  --  if my wife does n't need me ! Clara laughs as Godesby and Miss Godesby enter from behind the house . Trotter meets them , with Clara on his arm .

I give you my word of honor Sterling will not run away . It is under such an understanding with him that I am pleading his case in his stead . He will stay here and work till he has paid you back , every cent . Jessica enters hurriedly from the house . Jessica . Jessica Hunter In great excitement . Mr. Warden , Mr. Warden , Dick has gone ! Warden . Edward Warden Sterling ? Gone ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Gone ? Godesby . Godesby That 's good ! Warden . Edward Warden Do n't be a fool , Godesby . How do you mean " gone , " Miss Hunter ? Jessica . Jessica Hunter I do n't altogether know . While I was out this morning , Blanche received a message from mother saying she 'd been  --  She hesitates , looking toward Godesby and Miss Godesby . Warden . Edward Warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jessica . Jessica Hunter She told Blanche they would be glad to have her here at one o'clock for breakfast .

Godesby Not that I know of . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Eager to hear more . No , no ! Jessica . Jessica Hunter No , they say not . She probably went first to Aunt Ruth 's . Before I got back , Dick , who 'd been out  --  Warden . Edward Warden He was at my house . Jessica . Jessica Hunter Yes . He came back , questioned Jordan as to where Blanche was , went upstairs , and then went away again , leaving a note for Blanche , which I found when I came home  --  Warden . Edward Warden Eagerly . Yes ? Jessica . Jessica Hunter It simply said , " Good-by . Dick . " Miss Godesby . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's taken a train ! He 's cleared out ! Warden . Edward Warden Do you know if he took a bag or anything with him ? Jessica . Jessica Hunter No , he took nothing of that sort . Jordan went into his room and found a drawer open and empty , a drawer in which Dick kept  --  a pistol !  --  She drops her voice almost to a whisper . Warden . Edward Warden Good God , he 's shot himself ! Jessica . Jessica Hunter Perhaps not  --  he left the house . Warden . Edward Warden Yes , if he were really determined to shoot himself , why would n't he have done it there in his own room ? Jessica . Jessica Hunter What can we do ? What can we do ? Warden . Edward Warden I 'll get Mr. Mason ; he 's with your mother ; he must go back to town at once . Going to the house . Jessica . Jessica Hunter He can go with me ; I 'd better be at the house . Some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes into the house . Miss Godesby and her brother ignore and apparently forget the presence of Jessica in their excitement . They both speak and move excitedly . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I ought to have suspected something when Sterling told me he was getting ten per cent for my money ,  --  the blackguard ! Godesby . Godesby I always told you you were a fool not to take care of your money yourself ! You know more about business than most men . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I did n't want to be bothered ; besides , there was always something very attractive about Sterling . I do n't mind telling you that if he had fallen in love with me instead of the stiff-necked woman he married , I 'd have tumbled over myself to get him . Godesby . Godesby How do you feel about him now ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Now ! Thank God , I 'm saved such a waking up ! It 's going to make a big difference with my income , Howard ! I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you she 's got a pot of money stowed away all right in her own name . Jessica . Jessica Hunter Who can bear no more , interrupts . Please  --  please ! Remember that you 're speaking of my sister and that every word you are saying cuts through me like a knife . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I beg your pardon ; I ought to have thought . I like and respect you , Jess , and I 've been very rude . Jessica . Jessica Hunter You 've been more than that ; you 've been cruelly unjust to Blanche in all that you 've said ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Perhaps I have , but I do n't feel in a very generous mood ; I 've some excuse  --  so please forgive me . Warden renters Left . Warden . Edward Warden To Jessica .

GodesbyTo Miss Godesby . Do n't you give in ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Not for a minute ! To Warden . Do n't you think , under the circumstances , the wedding breakfast had better be called off , and my brother and I go back to town ? Warden . Edward Warden Not till you 've given me your promise , both of you , that you will keep silent about the embezzlement of your bonds for the sake of Mrs. Sterling and her son . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Half laughs . Huh ! Warden . Edward Warden For the sake of her mother , who is your friend . Sleigh-bells start up loud and die off quickly ; Jessica has gone . Miss Godesby . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends we are ,  --  for the amusement we can get out of each other . This is the case ,  --  I trusted this man with my affairs . He was very attractive  --  I do n't deny that ; business with Dick Sterling became more or less of a pleasure  --  but that does n't cut any ice with me ; he 's stolen my money . To put it plainly , he 's a common thief , and he ought to be punished ; why should he go scot free and a lot of others not ? You know perfectly well his note would n't be worth the paper it was written on ; and , anyway , if he has n't gone and sneaked out of the world , I wo n't lift my little finger to keep him from the punishment he deserves ! Godesby . Godesby Good for you , Julia ! Warden . Edward Warden Do n't you put your oar in , Godesby ; just let this matter rest between your sister and me ! She 's always been known as the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't choose a very conciliatory way of bringing us around ! Warden . Edward Warden I 'm not choosing any way at all ; I 'm striking right out from the shoulder . There is n't time for beating round the bush ! I 'm pleading for the good name and honorable position of a perfectly innocent , a fine , woman , and for the reputation and unimpeded career of her son ! And I make that appeal as man to man and woman ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I have nothing to do with any one in this matter but Sterling himself , who has robbed me , and I 'll gladly see him suffer for it ! Warden . Edward Warden Now look here , Miss Godesby , you belong to a pretty tough crowd in society , but I know at heart you 're not a bad sort ! What good will it do you ? Granted even that you do n't care for Mrs. Sterling , still do n't tell me you 're the kind of woman to take a cruel pleasure in seeing another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not one of those catty creatures ! You 're a clever woman , and I do n't doubt you can be a pretty hard one , too , at times ; but you 're just  --  that 's the point now  --  you 're JUST  --  Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Interrupting . Exactly ! I 'm just , an eye for an eye ! Sterling is a thief , let him get the deserts of one ! She sits on the bench determinedly . Warden . Edward Warden But you ca n't look at only one side ! You ca n't shut your eyes to his wife 's suffering , too , and she does n't deserve it ! Neither does her boy deserve to share his disgrace . He sits beside her . Why , you have it in your power to handicap that boy through his whole life by publishing his father a criminal ; or you can give that boy a fair show to prove himself more his mother 's son than his father 's , and to live an honest  --  who knows  --  perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to accept such a responsibility . Ryder  --  Warden . Edward Warden Rises , interrupting her . Ryder 's word is given to be silent . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Well , that 's his lookout . Warden . Edward Warden You 'll have many a heart wrench , I 'll bet you ! You 'll have to run across the results of the harm you do to Mrs. Sterling and Richard day in and day out , year after year ! I do n't believe you realize what it means ! Why , I know you ca n't bear to see a dog suffer ! I met you last week on the street carrying a mangy , crippled brute of a little dog in your arms , afraid lest he 'd get into the hands of the vivisectionists , and yet here you 'll let a boy and his mother  --  Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Interrupts him , struggling against a tiny emotion which he has stirred . Stop ! Stop ! I do n't want you working on my feelings that way . She rises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only knocking at the door of your heart . And now because it 's opened just a tiny way , you want to shut it in my face again . Will you leave this woman 's name fit for her to use ? Wo n't you make that boy 's life worth living to him ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Alter a moment 's pause , looks straight into Warden 's face . I 'll tell you what I 'll do . Get me some security , some sort of indorsement of Sterling 's note  --  Warden . Edward Warden If the man 's only alive ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby And I 'll hold my tongue . Warden . Edward Warden How long will you give me ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , come , I ca n't have any monkey business ! You must get me my security to-day . Warden . Edward Warden To-day ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Yes . Warden . Edward Warden But  --  Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby That 's my last word . Godesby . Godesby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sha n't try to persuade her against that . Will you leave your sister alone with me a moment . Perhaps you 'll see about your sleigh being ready to return to town . Godesby . Godesby I 've no objection  --  if Julia wishes it . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Yes , go on , Howard ! Godesby goes out back of house . Warden . Edward Warden Left alone with Miss Godesby , goes nearer to her . Look here ! Will you accept my indorsement ? Will I be all right ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Incredulously . Certainly . Warden . Edward Warden Then it 's settled ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby You do n't mean it ! Warden . Edward Warden I do . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby You 'd be willing to lose  --  A revelation comes to her . Oh  --  for Mrs. Sterling ! I see ! Warden . Edward Warden Very seriously . I would n't . I would n't see . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby And she 's always been blackguarding me for my affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Warden Interrupts strongly . Do n't say any more , please , Miss Godesby ! I only wish your brother had said that much instead of you . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Disagreeably . So you 're in love with Blanche Sterling ? Warden . Edward Warden No ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , come , do n't tell a lie about it ; that will only make it seem worse . Warden . Edward Warden Well , suppose I were in love with her  --  what of it ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Nothing ; only , my dear Warden , that woman  --  Warden . Edward Warden Interrupts . Wait a minute ! You 've got me in a corner , but knowing half the truth , you must n't guess the whole . She is even more ignorant of my love for her than you were ten minutes ago ! Miss Godesby smiles and makes a little satirical exclamation . You do n't believe that , but I 'll make you . I 'm going to tell you something I 've never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big test , because I 've got to . Apparently , I ca n't help myself ; but after all , somehow I believe in the human nature in you , and you 've got it in your power to help or hurt the woman I love  --  I say those words aloud for the first time  --  the woman I love ! He has finished his speech in a lowered tone throbbing with controlled feeling . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Incredulously . You 've never told her ? Warden . Edward Warden Never ; and you show how little you really know her when you ask that question ! She loves her husband . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I 'm not so sure about that ! Warden . Edward Warden I am , and I love her . But surely the silent love of a man , like mine , is no insult to a good woman  --  can not harm her ! A love that is never spoken , not even whispered , ca n't hurt any one , except , perhaps , the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint ; you showed just now your real surprise at what circumstances revealed to you ! I 'd die sooner than bring the slightest shadow of a scandal on her , and I 've hugged my secret tight . Have you any idea what such a love means ? How it grows and grows , its strength shut in , held back , doubling and redoubling its powers !  --  its ideality increasing , the passion suppressed , locked up ! Good God ! I tremble sometimes when I think  --  suppose some day it should burst out , break my control , master me ! A pause . And here , now , I 've told you ; I 'm sorry , but I had to for her sake again . Will you help me keep my secret ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby After a second 's pause . Yes , because I believe you . Warden . Edward Warden And Mrs. Sterling ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Slowly , with sincere meaning . I envy her ! Her voice breaks and she turns away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I indorse Sterling 's note ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby You need n't sign the note ; my brother 'd have to see it . I 'll take your word for the indorsement . She offers him her hand . They shake hands . Warden . Edward Warden What a brick you are ! You know you do n't do yourself anything like justice in the world ! Godesby renters Left and after him a Man Servant in ordinary clothes , who passes through the archway at back Centre . Godesby . Godesby Ready ! Warden . Edward Warden Aside to her . You can promise his silence about Sterling ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , yes , he 's absolutely dependent upon me . Warden . Edward Warden Thank you . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby To Ned with a forced gaiety . Good-by ! Warden . Edward Warden Again shaking her hand . Good-by . He looks his thanks at her . Godesby . Godesby Well ? What did you do ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby As they go . Do n't worry ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still feel up to it ! They go out Left and at the same time the Servant enters from the archway at back Centre carrying some fire logs in his arms . This Servant speaks with a slight French accent . As he reaches the house , Warden stops him with a question , and the Godesbys ' sleigh-bells start up and quickly die away . The sun begins to set . Warden . Edward Warden Have you an empty sitting room ? Servant . Servant Yes , sair . Warden . Edward Warden Warm ? Servant . Servant I will soon arrange a fire . Warden . Edward Warden I wish you would , please . Servant . Servant Ze big room for ze breakfast is altogether ready and warm ; you will be able to go in there now . Warden . Edward Warden No , that would n't do . It 's all right out here for me , only I am expecting a lady . Sleigh-bells are heard in the distance , coming quickly nearer . Servant . Servant Yes , sair . Warden . Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in it , ask if her name is Mrs. Sterling , and if she says yes , tell her Mr. Warden is here and would like to speak with her a moment before she goes in to Mrs.  --  He hesitates a second . Servant . Servant Trottair ? Warden . Edward Warden Yes . Servant . Servant Yes , sair . He goes into the house . The sun grows red , and the colors of sunset creep over the sky during the scene which follows . After a moment the Servant shows Blanche out from the house . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Surprised and depressed . Good morning , Mr. Warden , have you been asked to these funeral baked meats ? Warden . Edward Warden No , I 'll explain why I am here in a few minutes . Only let me ask you first when you last saw your husband ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Early this morning . Warden . Edward Warden And you have come just now from where ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Aunt Ruth 's . Of course you know about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but my heart failed me and I turned back to my aunt 's . She has persuaded me that I ought to come and put the best face on the matter possible , but it seems as if I 'd had now a little more than I can bear ! Her voice breaks and her eyes fill with tears . Warden . Edward Warden Almost tenderly . Shall we go inside ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling No , no ! Let us stay out in the air ; my head would burst in one of these close little rooms . Have you seen mother ? Warden . Edward Warden No , not yet . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Where is Dick ? Did he go to Ryder 's ? Warden . Edward Warden No , but I have some good news to tell you all the same  --  Ryder has promised silence . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling With tremendous relief . Oh ! that 's too good , too good to be true ! To whom did he promise ? Warden . Edward Warden I want you not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , it was  --  Warden . Edward Warden Lying . No , it was  --  Mason . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Doubting him . Mr. Mason ? Warden . Edward Warden And I 've more good news for you . Mrs. Sterling  --  the Godesbys , too ; they will be silent . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling You 're sure ? Warden . Edward Warden We have their word ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Pointedly . Mr. Mason again ?  --  Warden bows his head in assent . He was here ? Warden . Edward Warden Some time ago , but only for a minute . He did n't stay ; he went to find your husband . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling But the Godesbys ? I just met them now on the road going back . How could Mr. Mason , if he did n't stay  --  Warden is embarrassed , and is silent , searching a way out of it . Oh , no ! no ! it was n't Mr. Mason ! I see the whole thing clearly . Dick was too great a coward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryder ! It was you who persuaded the Godesbys !  --  Warden shakes his head and makes a movement to deny it . Blanche continues speaking , the words rushing to her lips , as her pent-up heart opens and lets all her emotions suddenly free . Do n't try to deny it ; you ca n't make me believe you ! It 's to you I owe whatever promise the future has for me ! It is you who have given me all the happiness I 've had for years . It is you who have watched over , taken care of , me  --  you , the best friend any woman in this world ever had . It is you now who have saved my boy 's honor . It is you who lift the weight off my shoulders , the weight off my heart ! You !  --  you !  --  you ! She sinks sobbing on the bench . It begins to snow very quietly and slowly . Warden . Edward Warden All his love bursting out into his face and into his voice , cries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect her from her trouble and take her to his breast . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Rising and looking straight into his eyes with a suddenly revealed great love in her own . Ned !  --  They hold this position some moments , gazing into each other 's eyes ; then finally Warden makes a movement towards her , crying out more triumphantly , having read and realized her love for him . Warden . Edward Warden Blanche ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Moving a half step back from him . No  --  Warden . Edward Warden No ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Look  --  look , it 's beginning to snow ! Warden . Edward Warden Very softly . What do you mean ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Desperately . I mean to speak of anything except what is in your thoughts at this moment ! Help me not to forget that no matter what he has done , Dick is still my husband . Warden . Edward Warden You do n't know all he has done ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling How not " all " ? What else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warden . Edward Warden He has left you . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Echoes . Left me ?  --  Warden . Edward Warden Mason is searching for him . He left a note at your house which Jess read ; it was only one word " Good-by . " Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Echoes again . Good-by ! Sleigh-bells are heard in the distance , coming quickly nearer . What does it mean ? You 're hiding something from me ! Tell me what else you know ? Warden . Edward Warden He left the house , but took something with him  --  something from a drawer in his room . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling After a second 's pause she whispers . His pistol ? Warden . Edward Warden Yes . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Aghast , still whispers . Has he done it ? Warden . Edward Warden I do n't know ; I 'm waiting word from Mason . The sleigh-bells stop . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Excited . But we ca n't wait here doing nothing ; we must go , too ! Warden . Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd better wait here . He takes her hand in sympathy , but without suggesting the passion of a few moments before . Sterling enters hurriedly Left . He is wild with drink and jealousy . Sterling . Richard Sterling Drop my wife 's hand ! They turn in great surprise . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Dick ! Fright at his appearance is mingled with her surprise . Warden . Edward Warden At the same time as Blanche . Sterling ! They do not drop hands . Sterling . Richard Sterling Coming nearer , very strong . Drop my wife 's hand ! They do so quickly , not understanding yet . So I 've caught you ! Warden . Edward Warden Angry . Caught us ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Yes , I had my suspicions roused some time ago ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Of what ? Sterling . Richard Sterling I could go to the devil  --  what did you two care ! I could go to State 's Prison ! All the better  --  out of your way ! Warden . Edward Warden You 're speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my house this morning ; my wife was gone  --  no message left where to ! But I questioned the servant . She 'd driven here ! Why ? Ha ! A bitter half laugh ; he turns to Blanche . You 've come here once too often ! Warden . Edward Warden Very strong . Sterling ! Sterling . Richard Sterling To Warden , but ignoring his exclamation . Then I went to your house . They knew where you 'd gone ! You ought to train your servants better ! Both here ! Warden . Edward Warden If you 're not careful , I 'll ram your insinuations down your throat . Sterling . Richard Sterling Jeers . " Insinuations ? " I 've caught you ! I make no " insinuations . " I tell you both you 're caught ! You 're my wife 's lover , and she 's your damned mis  --  Interrupted . Warden . Edward Warden Seizing Sterling by the throat . Do n't you finish ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Sh !  --  for Heaven 's sake ! To Warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says . Warden leaves Sterling . Sterling . Richard Sterling No , you never were a liar , I 'll give you credit for that ,  --  so confess the truth  --  you 're his  --  Interrupted . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Excited beyond her control . Listen ! And you shall have the truth if you want it ! These years that he 's been befriending me I never dreamed of loving him nor thought of his loving me . Dick sneers . Wait ! No , not even the day my father was buried , when I learned outright you were dishonest ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Surprised . What do you mean ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling What I say  --  I learned it then from a paper of my father 's . I should n't have kept my knowledge to myself  --  I see that now ; but I did , for your sake , not for love of you  --  the love went for good that day . But here , a moment ago , I realized for the first time that my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion the noblest woman in the world might be proud of ! I did n't tell him then I loved him , but now I take this chance , I take it gladly before you !  --  forced by you ! I tell him now , what perhaps he has already guessed , I love him with all my heart  --  I love him ! I love him ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Damn you both ! then it 's the end of me ! He pulls out a pistol and tries to put it to his temple . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Cries out . Ned ! Warden . Edward Warden Seizes Sterling , catches his arm , and wrenches the pistol from him . So that 's what you planned to do , is it  --  make a wretched scene like that ? It begins to snow more heavily . Sterling . Richard Sterling In utter collapse and shame . Why did you stop me ? I 'm better out of the world . I 'm crazy with shame . First I disgraced and now I 've insulted  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's my wife . A moment 's pause . Blanche .

Mrs. Sterling No , good . Sterling . Richard Sterling Echoes . Good ! Starting to go , he turns at the porch . I want you to know that I know I 'm a rotten beast . He goes out Left . Warden . Edward Warden You 're going back home ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling " Home ! " With a faint smile . I should hardly call it that . Warden . Edward Warden Aside to her . You 're not afraid ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Half smiling . Oh , no ! And my boy 's there . The thick falling snow almost hides them , but they are unconscious of it . Warden . Edward Warden What 's to be done ? Blanche .

Kissing her hand very tenderly and almost with a certain kind of awe , as The Curtain Slowly Falls ACT IV The following morning ; at the Sterlings ' ; the library ; a warm , livable , and lovable room , full of pictures , photographs , and books ; mistletoe and holly decorate everywhere . In the bow-window at back there is a large bird-cage with half a dozen birds in it . The furniture is comfortable and heavily upholstered . At Left there is a fireplace with logs ready , but the fire is not lit . There a big table near the centre , full of magazines , illustrated papers , and books . A big arm-chair is beside the table , and other chairs conversationally close .

Ruth . Ruth I 'm glad you 're spared this . With a long-drawn breath she places the photograph back upon the table and turns to greet Blanche , who comes in Right . Good morning , my dear . She kisses her . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Good morning . You 've had my note ? Ruth nods . Thank you . I wanted to see you before I saw any one else . You must help me decide , only you can . Ruth .

But if it breaks my heart  --  if it breaks my heart ? Ruth . Ruth Hearts do n't break from the pain that comes of doing right , but from the sorrow of doing wrong ! Neither woman speaks for a minute ; in the silence Ruth hears Richard . What 's that ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Hearing now for the first time . Richard singing one of his carols . Ruth .

Richard Sterling No , I 'm too worn out . Look at my hand ! Holds out a trembling hand . I tell you literally I have n't slept for weeks  --  I thought you 'd give me some chloral or something .

Richard Sterling Very well , but give me something to take to-night in case I ca n't sleep then . Dr.Steinhart . Dr. Steinart Takes out a note-book and writes with a stylographic pen . Be careful what you eat to-day . How about this drinking  --  did your business trouble come after it began , or did the whiskey come after the business trouble ? Sterling . Richard Sterling That 's it . Dr. Steinhart . Dr. Steinart Um  --  Giving Sterling the paper which he tears out of his note-book . Look here , I 've a busy day before me ; but I 'll look in to-morrow , and we 'll have a good talk . Sterling . Richard Sterling Thank you . I say , what is this ? Dr. Steinhart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one-quarter-grain tablets . Sterling . Richard Sterling Is n't that very little ? Dr. Steinhart . Dr. Steinart Oh , no ; you try one , and repeat in an hour if it has n't done its work . Sterling . Richard Sterling But you 've only given me two tablets , and I tell you I 'm awfully hard to influence ! Dr. Steinhart . Dr. Steinart Two 's enough ; we do n't give a lot of drugs to a man in a nervous condition like yours . Do n't let them wake you for luncheon if you 're asleep . Sleep 's best for you . Good-by  --  pleasant dreams . He goes out Left . Sterling . Richard Sterling Reads off the prescription . " Two one-quarter-grain tablets sulphate of morphia , Wm . B. Steinhart  --  " And in ink !

He rings an electric bell beside the mantel , and waves the paper in the air to dry it . Blanche enters Right . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I heard the doctor go . Is anything serious the matter ? Sterling . Richard Sterling If it were my body only that had gone wrong , Blanche ! Leonard enters Left . To Leonard . Take this prescription round the corner and have it put up . Leonard . Leonard Yes , sir . Sterling . Richard Sterling And bring it to me with a glass of water . Leonard . Leonard Yes , sir . He goes out Left . Blanche is still standing .

Sterling . Richard Sterling Yes ! I must take the true advantage of this chance your goodness gives me . I must right myself , so that people need not hesitate to speak of his father in Richard 's presence . And this I will do . With great conviction he rises .

Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I tell you truly my love for you is gone for good . Sterling . Richard Sterling I 'll win it back  --  you did love me , you did , did n't you , Blanche ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I loved the man I thought you were . Do you remember that day in the mountains when we first really came to know each other , when we walked many , many miles without dreaming of being tired ? Sterling . Richard Sterling And found ourselves at sunset at the top instead of below , by our hotel ! Oh , yes , I remember ! The world changed for me that day . He sinks back into the arm-chair , overcome , in his weakened state , by his memories and his realization of what he has made of the present . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling And for me ! I knew then for the first time you loved me , and that I loved you . Oh ! how short life of a sudden seemed ! Not half long enough for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vivid change of feeling . Has it turned out so ? Sterling . Richard Sterling How different ! Oh , what a beast ! what a fool ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Speaking with pathetic emotion , tears in her throat and in her eyes . And that early summer 's day you asked me to be your wife ! She gives a little exclamation , half a sob , half a laugh . It was in the corner of the garden ; I can smell the lilacs now ! And the raindrops fell from the branches as my happy tears did on father 's shoulder that night , when I said , " Father , he will make me the happiest woman in the world ! " Sterling . Richard Sterling O God ! to have your love back ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling You ca n't breathe life back into a dead thing ; how different the world would be if one could ! Sterling . Richard Sterling You can bring back life to the drowned ; perhaps your love is only drowned in the sorrow I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes her head ; the smile dies away . Life to me then was like a glorious staircase , and I mounted happy step after step led by your hand till everything seemed to culminate on the day of our wedding . You men do n't , ca n't realize , what that service means to a girl . In those few moments she parts from all that have cherished her , made her life , and gives her whole self , her love , her body , and even her soul sometimes  --  for love often overwhelms us women  --  to the man who , she believes , wants , starves , for her gifts . All that a woman who marries for love feels at the altar I tell you a man ca n't understand ! You treated this gift of mine , Dick , like a child does a Santa Claus plaything  --  for a while you were never happy away from it , then you grew accustomed to it , then you broke it , and now you have even lost the broken pieces ! Sterling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined . I will find them , and put them together again . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Again smiles sadly and shakes her head . First we made of every Tuesday a festival  --  our wedding anniversary . After a while we kept the twenty-eighth of every month ! The second year you were satisfied with the twenty-eighth of April only , and last year you forgot the day altogether . And yet what a happy first year it was ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Ah , you see I did make you happy once ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Blessedly happy ! Our long silences in those days were not broken by an oath and a fling out of the room . Oh , the happiness it means to a wife to see it is hard for her husband to leave her in the morning , and to be taken so quickly  --  even roughly  --  into his arms at night that she knows he has been longing to come back to her . Nothing grew tame that first year . And at its end I climbed to the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed and cried big man 's tears , the first I 'd ever seen you cry , and kissed me first , and then little Richard lying on my warm arm , and said , " God bless you , little mother . " There is a pause . Blanche cries softly a moment . Sterling is silent , ashamed . Again she turns upon him , rousing herself , but with a voice broken with emotion . And what a bad father you 've been to that boy ! Sterling . Richard Sterling I did n't mean to ! That 's done , that 's past , but Richard 's my boy . I 'll make him proud of me , somehow ! I 'll win your love back  --  you 'll see ! Blanche is about to speak in remonstrance , but stops because of the entrance of Leonard . He brings a small chemist 's box of tablets in an envelope and a glass of water on a small silver tray . Leonard . Leonard Your medicine , sir . He puts it on the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you ! He takes the box of tablets out of the envelope . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Going to him . You do n't realize why I 've told you all this ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Counting out the tablets . One , two . To give me hope ! To give me hope ! He empties the other ten tablets into the envelope , twists it up , and throws it in the fireplace . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling No , no , just the opposite ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Then you 've defeated your end , dear ; you will stay here with me . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Trying to make him realize the exact position . Opposite you at the table , receiving our friends , keeping up appearances , yes  --  but nearer to you than that ? No ! Never ! Sterling . Richard Sterling But you will stay ? Leonard enters from Left . Leonard . Leonard Miss Godesby , Mr. Warden . They enter . All greet each other . Warden nods stiffly to Sterling , barely acknowledging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposely speaking with good-humored raillery to relieve the tension of the situation . Well , you 're a nice lot , are n't you ? Sterling . Richard Sterling I 'm so ashamed ! I 'm so ashamed ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , never mind that now . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling I have no words to thank you with . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Oh , that 's all right . The truth is , I 've made Warden bring me here , Sterling , for a bit of business . I had an emotional moment yesterday and went off my head a bit . I stand by what I said as to keeping quiet , but  --  well , I 'm like any other old maid who hates dust on her mantelpiece  --  I 'm fidgety not to make some sort of a bluff at putting this thing on a business basis . Warden . Edward Warden Excuse me , Miss Godesby , I think Sterling ought to know the truth . Sterling . Richard Sterling Now what ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has kicked up an infernal row , and refuses to hold his tongue . Sterling . Richard Sterling Then I 'm ruined after all ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Wait , I 've left him with Mr. Mason . I feel certain I can assure his silence if I can only show him some sort of an agreement to pay , an acknowledgment of the  --  the  --  affair , signed and sealed . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Signed by whom ? Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Your husband and yourself will do . Sterling . Richard Sterling But both names are worthless . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Not as a point of honor . Sterling . Richard Sterling Ah ! no , not my wife 's . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Nor yours to me . Come along ! She goes to the table with Sterling , and unfolding a paper gives it to him . He signs it . Warden . Edward Warden Aside to Blanche , apologizing for his presence . She made me come  --  she would n't come alone ; otherwise I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Sterling It 's as well  --  I 've decided . Oh , I wonder if I 'm doing wrong . Looking him straight in the face . Warden . Edward Warden Looking back searchingly in hers to read the truth , but believing that she will certainly leave her husband . No , you ca n't do wrong ! But I must warn you of one thing  --  I 'm not any longer the controlled man I was . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Come along now , Mrs. Sterling , brace up and give me your name , and Warden , witness , please . They do so . Of course , my dears , I know perfectly well that legally this is n't worth the paper it 's written on . Exchanging a serious and meaning look with Warden . But my idiot of a brother wo n't realize that , which is the point . One thing more  --  will you both dine with me next week , Thursday ? There is an embarrassed pause , which , with quick intuition , she understands . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , that 's settled ! Sterling . Richard Sterling What an awfully good sort you are ! Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby Thanks , not always  --  I 've been a mucker more than once in my life ! I must go Shaking hands with Blanche. and relieve Mr. Mason of my brother , or he 'll be accusing me of inhuman treatment ; more than one consecutive hour of my brother ought to be prevented by the police . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling You are very , very good . Miss Godesby . Miss Godesby I think if you and I can get well over this , we 'll be real friends , and I have n't many , have you ? Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Takes her hand . You can count upon me and my boy so long as we live . She impulsively but tenderly kisses her . Miss Godesby is very much surprised , but moved . Miss Godesby .

Tell him the truth . She goes out after Miss Godesby . Warden . Edward Warden Dick . Sterling . Richard Sterling Ned ? Warden . Edward Warden I have nothing to say to you , Sterling . Warden looks away and whistles a tune to show his unwillingness to listen . Sterling speaks clearly so Warden shall hear . Sterling . Richard Sterling I have a message for you from my wife . There is a second 's pause . Warden stops whistling and turns and looks at Sterling . She asks me to explain  --  to tell  --  to tell you a decision she has come to . There is another pause . Warden . Edward Warden Yes ? Anxious , at a supreme tension , and now a little alarmed as to the decision . Sterling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warden . Edward Warden Adds . Yet ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Ever ! Warden . Edward Warden Losing his control . That 's a lie ! Sterling . Richard Sterling I could n't believe it , either , when she told me . It was her first word to me to-day . I said , " You are going to divorce me , " and she answered , " No . " Warden . Edward Warden She 's sacrificing herself for some reason  --  her boy ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Never mind , she wo n't leave me ; I have her promise , and I 'll win back her love ! Warden . Edward Warden You fool ! You ca n't win her back ! She would never have loved me if you had n't disillusioned , dishonored her ! I 'm not worthy of her , but I 'll never dishonor her , and , please God , never disappoint her , and so I 'll keep her love . Sterling . Richard Sterling Well , as to that , she decides to stay , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 'll accept that sacrifice ! You do n't even love her . You 're only thinking of yourself now . Love , real love , forgets itself . You , after having spoilt half her life , are willing to spoil the rest , for your own sake ! Sterling . Richard Sterling No , for the boy 's sake , and her sake  --  to save a scandal  --  the world  --  Interrupted . Warden . Edward Warden Beside himself . Oh , damn the world ! It 's heaven and hell you 'd better think of . Scandal ! It could n't harm her , and the hurt it would do you is a small price to pay . Those whom God has joined  --  yes ! but it was the devil bound her to you ! Sterling . Richard Sterling Here ! I 've had enough ! Look out ! Warden . Edward Warden Moves toward him . You look out  --  you sha n't rob her of her happiness . You  --  a drunkard ! A forger ! A thief ! Sterling . Richard Sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Warden . Edward Warden Hah !

We 'll find a place , and something to fight with , or fists if you 'd rather ! You would n't kill me before I 'd got you out of her way for good . Will you fight ? Coming closer to him . Sterling . Richard Sterling No ! Warden . Edward Warden Getting more and more enraged . If you lose , you go away , and set her free of your own will ! Sterling . Richard Sterling No ! Warden . Edward Warden Losing entirely his self-control . What do you want to make you fight  --  will that ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richard Sterling Yes ! He springs toward Warden as Ruth and Mason enter Left . The two men stand rigid , Warden breathing heavily . Ruth . Ruth Blanche , may I bring in  --  where 's Blanche ? Sterling . Richard Sterling I do n't know . Mason . Frederick Mason Good morning , gentlemen . There is no response . Warden is with great difficulty restraining himself . His lips are compressed tightly and his hands clenched . Ruth . Ruth What 's the trouble ? Sterling . Richard Sterling I have just told Warden my wife 's decision not to leave me . Ruth . Ruth Showing her relief and satisfaction in her face , turns to Warden . You wo n't try to shake that resolve ? Warden . Edward Warden Unable to control himself . But I will !

I came to see you about this business of your acknowledgments to Miss Godesby and Miss Hunter . Sterling . Richard Sterling Later , later . To-morrow I will decide  --  He motions him away . Mason goes to him and puts his hand on his shoulder . Mason . Frederick Mason Decide well  --  He hesitates a moment and then goes out Right . Sterling . Richard Sterling Watching him go . There 's not one soul in this world who cares for me , and it 's my own fault . Richard is heard upstairs again singing " Once in Royal David 's City . " Sterling lifts his head and listens . Yes , one little soul loves me , and it would be better for him , too , if I went away . I 'll go to sleep and see how I feel about it when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes out the box of tablets . He starts suddenly , but very slightly , and his muscles tighten . After all , why not end it all now , at once , without any more bother ? He looks in the box , and glances up questioningly ; then he remembers the fireplace where he threw the other tablets and looks across the room at the logs . He rises , goes over , and sees in the fireplace the twisted envelope which holds the other tablets . He bends over to pick it up ; he stops short . No ! Why should n't I try it , anyway ? She , herself , gives me the chance ! He rings the electric bell , and walking away from the fireplace , takes up with a trembling hand the papers left by Mason ; he wipes the damp from his forehead with his handkerchief . To Jordan , who enters Left . Light the fire quickly ; I feel cold . He sinks into the arm-chair , weak from the mental strain . Leonard . Leonard It 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sterling Do as I tell you  --  light the fire . Leonard . Leonard Looking for matches on the mantel , finds the box empty . There are no matches , sir ; I must get one . Sterling . Richard Sterling No , do n't go  --  here  --  here  --  He gives him a match from his own box . Leonard notices the trembling hand and suppressed excitement of Sterling , and involuntarily glances up , but quickly looks back to his work and strikes a match . The match goes out . Leonard . Leonard I shall need another match , please , sir . Sterling . Richard Sterling With one in his fingers taken from his match-box , he alters his mind . I have no more . He puts away his match-box . Never mind the fire ; get me a pint bottle of champagne . Leonard . LeonardWith a surreptitious side glance of curiosity . Very well , sir . He goes out Left . Sterling . Richard Sterling That was funny ; that was very funny ! I wonder if it was accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes to the fireplace and picks up the twisted envelope . If not now  --  perhaps some other time  --  who knows ? He thrusts the envelope in his vest pocket , and takes up the papers again from the table to look over them . I ca n't read these things ! Throwing them down . The words mean nothing to me ! There is the sound outside of a cork being drawn . Leonard enters with the champagne and a glass and places them beside Sterling . Leonard . Leonard Shall I light the fire now , sir ? Sterling . Richard Sterling No , never mind now . Leonard . Leonard Yes , sir . He goes out Left . Sterling half fills the glass with champagne . He takes out the box of tablets and counts aloud . Sterling . Richard Sterling One , two , three , four  --  He puts all in the glass , dropping them as he counts . He hesitates , then quickly drops in two more and drinks quickly . The glass is empty . He sits by the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes ready his stylographic pen . Let me see ; can I make it seem accidental ; it would be so much less bother and trouble for them ! He thinks a second , then writes . " I have accidentally taken an overdose of my sleeping draught . I have tried to call some one , but it 's no use . I ask only one thing , that you forget all my sins , wipe out their memory with my name . I want my boy to change his name , too . " He hesitates a moment , and then scratches that sentence heavily out . No , I wo n't say that . He waits a moment . God in heaven , what would n't I give for one friendly word just now ! Some one to sort of say good-by to me  --  take my hand  --  even a servant ! He looks about him , showing signs of drowsiness . The door Right bursts open .

Richard Sterling I know what a beastly friend I 've been , and yesterday was more than any man would stand , but forgive that , too , will you ? I 've always been a bad lot ! Warden . Edward Warden Goes to him and speaks , with the sympathy of a man for a child coming into his voice . No , a weak lot ; that 's been your ruin , Dickie . I 'll see you again before you go . Sterling . Richard Sterling No , I 'm going to sleep as long as I can now , and I do n't want any one to wake me up ; but when I do wake , I shall have other things to do . This is good-by . Warden . Edward Warden Well , good luck ! He starts to go . The two men look at each other , and finally Sterling gets the courage to hold out his hand . Warden hesitates a moment , then shakes it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been growing more and more drowsy , as soon as he is alone , goes with difficulty to the door and locks it . He is so drowsy that he leans against the door for a moment ; then he starts to go back to the table , but is unable to get there and sinks on the sofa half way between the table and the door . His eyes close , but suddenly he starts violently and tries to rise , but can not , crying out faintly . Sterling . Richard Sterling Good God  --  the money ! I forgot the money  --  who 'll pay my debts ? Ah , this is a fitting climax for my life  --  the weakest , dirtiest thing I 've done  --  He gets the letter from his pocket and holds it in his hand ; the light of the afternoon grows slowly dim , like his fading sight and senses . He murmurs twice in a faint , drowsy voice . Coward ! Coward ! Blanche , in the hall outside Right , calls his name . Blanche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The letter drops from his lifeless hands . Blanche enters with Ruth , followed by Richard , who rides a stick with a horse 's head and wears a soldier 's cap . Richard . Richard Sterling Merry Christmas , father ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Going toward the sofa . Dick ! Richard . Richard Sterling Merry Christmas , father ! Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Sh ! Father 's asleep . They steal back toward the other door when Warden enters Right . Warden . Edward Warden Oh , you are here ! I went down into the drawing-room where I left you . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Sh ! She points to Sterling , who lies apparently asleep . They speak in lowered voices . Warden . Edward Warden Yes , I have a message for you from him . Looking at Richard and Ruth . Ruth . Ru th Who understands . Come , Richard , I have n't seen your tree yet . She goes out Right with Richard . Warden . Edward Warden To Blanche . Give me your hand . She does so wonderingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tenderness in his voice . He is going away for good . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Away ? Warden . Edward Warden For good . Blanche . Mrs. Sterling Slowly , withdrawing her hand . For good ? She looks over toward Sterling , and then back to Warden . What does he mean ? Warden . Edward Warden We will know when he wakes .
