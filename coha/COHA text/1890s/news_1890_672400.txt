txt During the debate on the East Africa credits in the Reichstag to-day Baron von . Marschall explained that the mission of Emin Pasha in Africa , on the part of the Germans , would be confined to establishing friendly relations with those tribes in the interior who are within the German sphere of interest and to estimating the cost of eventually forming some fortified stations in the interior . In the negotiations with England regarding the boundaries of their respective possessions in Africa the predominating wish of Germany was to go hand in hand with England and to cultivate the common interests of both countries . The object was not to acquire as much territory as possible , but to keep together what was naturally connected by a course of waterways as a means of communication . On this point Germany was prepared to come to an understanding with England . In the course of the debate on the estimates for the expenses of the colonies , Gen. von Caprivi , the Imperial Chancellor , stated that he agreed with Prince Bismarck that the colonial policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . As matters now stood , the Government could not retreat from its position in regard to colonial affairs without the loss of honor and money . No change of his views or the system was to be in any way implied from his assumption of office . The Government would everywhere respect foreign rights and protect German rights . After referring to his past coolness toward colonization , Gen. von Caprivi said that during his short term of office he had read more on colonial matters than he had read during his whole previous life . He had thus become acquainted with the enormous difficulties of the colonial policy .

He fully agreed with Herr von Bomberger that the time might arrive when Europe would . require every mark and every man at home . Therefore he would not send a single mark or a single man to East Africa more than was absolutely necessary . It was also true , as Herr von Bomberger had said , that in the case of war Germany would perhaps be unable to defend her colonies . But experience taught that if Germany was victorious in Europe she would retain her colonies . In order to maintain these colonies , Germany must develop her navy and establish coaling stations . Regarding slavery , he said : " We must found . stations , and bullet and Bible must act in the cause of civilization . Without killing slave dealers you can never abolish slavery . ?
