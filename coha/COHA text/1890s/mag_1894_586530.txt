TAMMANY HALL . IN November , 1890 , a mayor for the term of two years was to be elected in the city of New York . It was a foregone conclusion that the Democratic candidate , whoever he might be , would be chosen , and naturally , as the time for making nominations approached , there was much speculation , in the newspapers and elsewhere , as to who would receive the office . But , strangely enough , there seemed to be a dearth of nominees ; persons were not " prominently mentioned , " as is usual under such circumstances ; and in fact it was utterly uncertain whom the electors had in mind , until a private citizen of New York opportunely arrived home from Europe . This was Mr. Richard Croker . When Mr. Croker came , New York found out who its chief executive officer was to be . He named the candidate ; the delegates to the nominating convention ratified his choice , and in due course the electors confirmed it . Who is Mr. Croker ? What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief city of a " free " country , - a city having more than two million inhabitants ? Mr. Croker emigrated to New York from Ireland about forty years ago , being then a small boy . He remained in New York , growing up on the East Side of the city , and while still in his teens he acquired some reputation as a " tough . " He became identified with what was known as the " Fourth Avenue Tunnel Gang ; " and subsequently he advanced to having a " gang " of his own . The " tough " recognizes but one virtue , that of courage , and this young Irishman possessed that virtue in a far higher degree than is the case with most " toughs . " In 1866 he defeated one Richard Lynch in a fight at Jones 's Woods , on a Sunday morning . Afterward , he was matched to fight a well-known professional , Mr. Owney Geoghegan ; but this arrangement fell through . At one time Mr. Croker kept a liquor saloon . Later , he served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he went into politics , holding a small clerkship under Tweed and " Prince Harry " Genet . Rising a little , he became an alderman , and in that capacity he signed a paper agreeing to take no step and to cast no vote without first obtaining the consent of Genet and several other persons named in the document . From 1874 to 1879 he held the office of county coroner . After that he was an alderman , again , and both Mayor Edson and Mayor Hewitt appointed him a fire commissioner . Mr. Croker is a man of medium height , heavily built , but not portly . He has a massive jaw , a well - shaped head , and though he wears a full beard it is possible to see that lie has a mouth which denotes a will of iron . His face is of the bulldog type , but it ! acks the good nature which those who are familiar with the really gentle character of the bulldog are able to detect in that animal 's countenance . Mr. Croker is reputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is extremely sagacious need not be said ; that he has an innate tendency to become respectable is evident from his career . At present he holds no public office whatever , but he governs New York more absolutely than most kings have governed their kingdoms . Though without visible means of support , he is a man of great wealth . He has built , or is building , one palace in Heidelberg , another in New York , and he has invested large . sums both in running and in trotting stables . How are these facts accounted for ? Why is Mr. Croker an autocrat and a millionaire ? The answer can be made in a word , - he succeeded John Kelly as Boss of Tammany Hall . ( // To explain Mr. Croker , therefore , it is necessary to explain Tammany Hall , and this I shall endeavor to do . In the first place , one must distinguish between the " Tammany Society or Columbian Order " and the political organization called for shortness " Tammany Hall . " The Tammany Society or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oath of office as first President of the United States . Tammany was an Indian chief of legendary fame , and the Tammany Society was a fraternal , benevolent , and patriotic club . It still exists , its principal function being to celebrate the Fourth of July by a banquet and addresses . The Tammany Society owns a large building on Fourteenth Street , near Third Avenue , and it leases rooms in this building to the " Democratic Republican General Committee of the City of New York , " otherwise and more commonly known as " Tammany Hall " or " Tammany . " Tammany Hall means , therefore , first , the building on Fourteenth Street where the " Democracy " have their headquarters ; and secondly , the political body officially known as the Democratic Republican General Committee of the City of New York . I had the curiosity , not long ago , to visit this famous building . Mr. Croker 's offices , on the first floor , are accessible to the public . They consist chiefly of a large room , furnished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Braves . In one corner is a closet , where , in safe seclusion , hangs a now historic telephone . The great man emerged from this closet as I entered the room . He wore a high hat , had a stout cane in his hand , and was evidently in a hurry to depart ; it was the morning of the day when Directum and Alix had their race at Fleetwood Park , which Mr. Croker attended in company with the Hon. W. C. WhitSince this paper was put in type the number of the executive committee hai been doubled , at Mr. Croker 's suggestion ; the desiga ney . Several Tammany leaders , wearing that jaunty , half-military air which always distinguishes them , were waiting about the room to speak with the Boss ; and he permitted them to approach in turn , which they did with deference . Each one had a few moments ' whispered conversation with the autocrat , who appeared sometimes to gi'ant , sometimes to refuse , the petitions offered to him . It was plain from his manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says no , he says it with absolute finality . Such is the Tammany leader ; and now , at the risk of being tedious , I shall state briefly how the Democratic Republican General Committee of the City of New York , and the bodies related to it , are formed . The city of New York is divided by law into thirty " assembly districts ; " that is , thirty districts , each of which elects an assemblyman to the state legislature . In each of these assembly districts there is held annually an election of members of the aforesaid Democratic Republican General Committee . This committee is a very large one , consisting of no less than five thousand men ; and each assembly district is allotted a certain number of members , based on the number of Democratic votes which it cast in the last preceding presidential election . Thus the number of the General Committeemen elected in each assembly district varies from sixty to two hundred and seventy . There is intended to be one General Committeeman for every fifty Democratic electors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a district leader , the head of Tammany Hall for that district . He is always a member of the General Committee , and these thirty men , one leader from each assembly district , form the executive committee of Tammany Hall . ' " By this committee , " says a Tammany official , " all the internal affairs of the being to have one " business man " as well as one politician elected from each assembly district . // organization are directed , its candidates for offices are selected , and the plans for every campaign are matured . " The General Committee meets every month , five hundred members constituting a quorum ; and in October of each year it sits as a county convention , to nominate candidates for the ensuing election . There is also a sub-committee on organization , containing one thousand members , which meets once a month . This committee takes charge of the conduct of elections . There is , besides , a finance committee , appointed by the chairman of the General Committee , and there are several minor committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee is at present Mr. Richard Croker . Such are the general committees of Tammany Hall ; and Ii pass now to the local officers and bodies . Each assembly district is divided by law into numerous election districts , or , as they are called in some cities , voting precincts , - each election district containing about four hundred voters . The election districts are looked after as follows : Every assembly district has a district committee , composed of the members of the General Committee elected from that district , and of certain additional members chosen for the purpose . The district committee appoints in each of the election districts included in that particular assembly district a captain . This man is the local boss . He has from ten to twenty-five aids , and he is responsible for the vote of his election district . There are about eleven hundred election districts in New York , and coiisequently there are about eleven hundred captains , or local bosses , each one being responsible to the ( assembly ) district committee by which he was appointed . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammany vote in his election district falls off without due cause , he is forthwith removed , and another appointed in his place . Usually , the captain is an actual resident in his district ; but occasionally , being selected from a distant part of the city , he acquires a fictitious residence in the district . Very frequently the captain is a liquor dealer , who has a clientele of customers , dependents , and hangers-on , whom he " swings , " or controls . He is paid , of course , for his services ; he has some money to distribute , and a little patronage , such as places in the street-cleaning department , or perhaps a minor clerkship . The captain of a district has a personal acquaintance with all its voters ; and on the eve of an election he is able to tell how every man in his district is going to vote . He makes his report ; and from the eleven hundred reports of the election district captains the Tammany leaders can predict with accuracy what will be the vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its integral form , might have embarrassed Tammany somewhat ; but when this measure was under discussion in the New York legislature , Mr. David B. Hill procured the passage of the " paster ballot amendment . " The paster is a ballot of the same size and shape as the official ballot . The voter brings his paster with him , if he chooses , and glues it over the official ballot , thereby wiping the latter out of existence . Probably the ingenuity of Tammany would be able to cope with any form of ballot that could be devised to make voting a secret and independent function . Some time ago , a Tammany leader , known as " Dry Dollar " Sullivan , suspecting treachery in his district , took the precaution to have the genuine Tammany ballot perfumed , so that by giving it a slight wave in the air its identity would be disclosed . Now , the voter does not himself deposit his ballot in the box ; that is done by a clerk or inspector who takes the ballot from the voter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only necessary for the clerk ( a Tammany man , of course ) to give the ballot a little flourish before dropping it in the slot ; and if it failed to breathe forth the expected per-1 ' // fume , the name of the man , who presented it was noted , and Dry Dollar Sullivan reckoned with him thereafter . From this brief survey , it will be seen how thorough and comprehensive is the organization of Tammany Hall . On the one hand , Tammany , by means of its General Committee , enlists an army of men , five thousand strong , which is perpetually in service . On the other hand , by means of the election district captains , with their lieutenants and henchmen , Tammany keeps an eye on every individual voter in the city of New York . Tammany knows no race or creed when it is a question of acquiring or preserving political power . Some of its election district captains are Jews ; and although most of the assembly district leaders are Irishmen , there are almost as many Germans as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is always on the alert to placate and promote men who have influence or ability . If there be , for example , an Italian in the district who shows some independence of character , and has a following , however small , among his countrymen , Tammany will grapple that man to itself with books of steel . He will get money or a place ; he will get something , or at least the promise of something . Tammany is very hospitable to rising talent , and it bears no grudges . It receives a convert with open arms , and rewards him in proportion to the harm which he did to the organization in his unregenerate days . Young men find that Tammany is ready to advance them as fast as their capabilities will permit . Then there is the social aspect of the organization . Every assembly district has its headquarters , always kept open , where the district committee meet and consult , and where an esprit de corps is developed and maintained . There is also , in almost every assembly district , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that district . They go there to smoke and drink , to talk , to read the newspapers , and especially to play cards . To understand the cohesive strength of Tammany one must understand how Tammany lies in the mind of an ordinary " average " member of the organization . In the first place , he glories in its history . He is obliged to admit , of course , that Tweed and his gang were the leaders of Tamnmany in their day ; but so is a Catholic forced to admit that some of the popes were bad men , and in neither case is the former existence of corrupt leaders a sufficient reason for giving up the organization . Besides , were not they also Tammany men who , with Tilden at their head , purged the society and overthrew Tweed ? As regards the national government , Tammany 's history is a noble one . In the war of 1812 , when many hearts were faltering , Tammany strengthened the hands of the administration . In the war of the rebellion , Tammany poured out its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should the occasion arise . The Tammany Society was founded as a patriotic body , - to cherish the cause of the people , to defend the Jeffersonian view of our government as against the aristocratic view , which , early in the century , was very strong . The same antagonism that existed then between Tammany and the upper class of New York citizens exists in some degree to-day . The Tammany man dislikes and despises the Anglomania of what is called " society " in New York ; he distrusts the l ) eople who compose " society , " and he believes them to be at heart out of sympathy with American principles ; whereas Tammany , in his view , is a concrete protest against monarchy and monarchical arrangements of society . He considers that Tammany is , on the whole , a good body , that it gives New York a good government , that it stands for what is manly and patriotic . It troubles him somewhat that a few of the leaders are said to be acquiring ill-gotten gains ; and if time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint others // in their stead . Meanwhile , Tammany is his party , his church , his club , his totem . To be loyal to something is almost a necessity of all uncorrupt natures , and especially of the Celtic nature . The Tammany man is loyal to Tammany . In truth , there is very little in New York to suggest any higher ideal . What kind of a spectacle does the city present to a man working his way up from poverty to wealth , - to one , for instance , who began as a " tough , " and ends as a capitalist ? The upper class - at least the richer class , the class chiefly talked about in the papers - is , with exceptions , of course , given over to material luxury and to ostentation . It is without high aims , without sympathy , without civic pride or feeling . It has not even the personal dignity of a real aristocracy . Its sense of honor is very crude . And as this class is devoted to the selfish spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting , of money . A Wall Street financier would overreach his own father in a business transaction . To get the better of the man with whom he is dealing has become a law of his nature ; and it is on that plane that business in general is now done . The tone of Delmonico 's , of the Union Club , of the Merchants ' Exchange , of the Stockbrokers ' Board , is no higher than the tone of Tammany Hall . It may be more refined , but it is probably less honest . A man of Mr. Croker 's origin , for example , commonly has an instinct of honesty , just as he has an instinct of pugnacity ; but this primeval instinct has almost died out of the trading and speculative class . When we come to consider the la boring population , we find that they also are looked after by Tammany . They have their " Associations . " Thus , in one assembly district there will be the " P. Divver Association , " in another the " Michael O'Hara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This means that once every year Mr. Divver , for instance , will give his constituents a vast free picnic ; chartering a steamer and barges , hiring at least one brass band , and perhaps providing lager beer gratis . Tainmany , therefore , stands not only for politics , but also for society and amusement and fellowship . P. Divver , besides being at the head of an " Association , " is district leader in his assembly district , and also a police justice . The result is that Mr. Divver exercises the powers of a feudal chieftain in the Middle Ages . In fact , modern New York presents a very good illustration of feudal government . It is feudalism tempered by newspaper oversight . We think of New York as one vast town ; but in reality it is a conglomeration of villages . This is especially true of the lower part of the city and of the laboring class . Professional men and those of similar standing in New York are less often natives of the town than are the small tradesmen and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , know one another . Many of them were born where they live ; they are acquainted with their alderman , a Tammany man , and with the district captain , and these functionaries are acquainted with them . If they want anything of the city , it is to Tammany that they must go for it . The force of laborers employed by the various departments is , of course , immense , and all this patronage is at the absolute disposal of Tammany . Moreover , those who have contracts with the city do not select their own laborers they employ such men as Tamnmany designates . If it is notwork that a citizen desires , but immunity from arrest or imprisonment , or from molestation by the police in his business , here again it is to Tammuany that he must apply for protection or relief . No wonder , then , that Tammany is strongly intrenched in New York . As to the power which Tammany has to harass its enemies and to intimidate all neutral persons I shall speak pre // sently ; but first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government which Tammany provides . If you ask an anti - Tammany man about this , he will most often give you to understand that the city government is administered largely by thieves and murderers . " Tammany , " writes Mr. Dorman B. Eaton in the North American Review , " is an institution composed of Lilliputs in influence and Brobdiugnags in rascality , in the hands of savage and venal partisans , on a level with gamblers , thieves , and pirates , who never apologize , and who would be ruined by any attempt at justification . " But if you push your inquiries a step farther , and ask what sort of a government these people give the city , you encounter some strange admissions . It is commonly conceded that in most respects the city is well governed . It is orderly ; the criminal class is well kept under ; the fire department is exceedingly good ; the police are extremely efficient , though often brutal and oppressive in their treatment of persons without money or influence ; the streets are well paved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . ' Finally , the cost of the city government is not excessive . The tax rate is $1.85 per hundred , and the valuation is low , being calculated at forty , or possibly fifty per cent . Two million people live in New York , and about two million more do business there . Consequently , there is in the lower part of the city , the business part , an immense accumulation of wealth , and the real estate in that quarter is of almost fabulous value . For this reason , a tax rate and valuation comparatively low produce a great return , so that in reality more money is raised by taxation than would appear to be the case at first sight . It is true , also , that This rul.e has doubtless been broken in some instances , but not , perhaps , with Mr. Croker 's knowledge or consent . In one case , a school trustee , being directed by a district a controversy exists as to whether the city government is economically administered . The subject is too vast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the whole , I think it may be assumed that the bill which Tammany sends in every year to the citizens of New York for carrying on their government is not unduly exorbitant . Furthermore , so far as is known , no frauds are committed upon the taxpayers outright , such as were perpetrated in the days of Tweed . Tainmany raises immense sums , but they are raised by contribution and by blackmail , not by theft . In short , the results are astonishingly good , considering the character of the persons who are now at the head of Tammany Hall ; and the inference is that the rank and file of Tammany Hall , including most of the office holders , are sound , honest men . As was remarked to me recently by a prominent lawyer , familiar with city politics , " If a reform movement should be made successfully here in New York , and an antiTammany machine be organized , the rank and file would remain substantially the same ; the leaders only would be changed . " Such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said , the good government which the city enjoys can be explained upon no other hypothesis . But there are many respects in which the government is not good ; it is growing worse every year in those respects ; and , above all , it is not a government of the people , by the people , or for the people . It is a government of Mr. Richard Croker , by means of Tammuany Hall , for Mr. Croker primarily , for Tammany Hall secondarily , and for the people in the third place . It is a literal fact that a despotism has got itself established in New York . There has been a transfer of political power as complete as that leader to appoint a certain teacher , appealed to Mr. Croker himself , and the Boss told him , in presence of the district leader , to make such appointments regardless of politics . // which , in the eighth century , made the mayors of the palace , instead of the reigning king , the real rulers of France . No one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Tammany Hall exercises there . No citizen is too humble to be beneath its notice ; no citizen is too rich or too powerful to be safe from its interference . There is not a man living in New York , however independent his character , who would not think twice before doing an act likely to offend Tammany , - or the city government , for they are one and the same thing . People outside of It*w York would be astonished if they knew what eminent citizens of that town , Republican as well as Democratic , what respectable and *vealthy corporations , curry favor with Tammany by keeping their hands off in city politics , by downright contributions of money , and in various other ways . In many assembly districts the Republican party organization is a sort of annex to Tammany ; many of the Republican inspectors of election are in the pay of Tammany . Rich and respectable Republicans in the city refrain from vigorous warfare against Tammany , because they do not want to be harassed in respect to their real estate , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . What power Tammany has in this direction I shall show presently ; but first I ought to state some of the ways in which Tammany misgoverns New York , the good features of its government having already been mentioned . Many of its appointments , especially during the last year or two , have been very bad . Few men in the city have more power for good or for evil than the police justices . They ought to be lawyers of high character , trained to sift evidence . Mayor Hewitt said , in one of his special messages , in 1888 , " I do not assert too much when I declare that the function of a police justice is of more importance to the community than that of a judge of the Court of Appeals . The latter finally settles the law , but the former applies it in the first instance in nearly all cases affecting the life , liberty , and property of the citizen . . . . The divorce between party politics and the bench should be made so complete that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a As a matter of fact , the present police justices were all active politicians when they were appointed , and most of them are now Tammany " leaders " in their respective assembly districts . Few , if any , of them are lawyers . Mayor Grant appointed , among others , Patrick Divver , keeper of a sailors ' boarding-house and a liquor dealer . He also appointed Thomas F. Grady , a former state senator , whose character was indicated in a letter ( which made much stir at the time ) written by Mr. Cleveland , then governor of New York , to John Kelly , then Boss of Tammany Hall . In this letter Mr. Cleveland requested that Mr. Grady should not again be sent to Albany as a legislator . He wrote : " I do not wish to conceal the fact that my personal comfort and satisfaction are involved in this matter . But I know that good legislation , based upon a pure desire to promote the interests of the people , and the improvement of legislative methods are also deeply involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an undertaker amid two clerks taken out of city offices . A police justice recently appointed by Mayor Gilroy is one Koch , a man who made a discreditable record as excise commissioner . The appointment was condemned by a committee of investigation reporting to the City Reform Club . Tammany 's representatives in the state legislature are mostly mere agents , and some of them are corrupt men . Some interesting particulars concerning them are given in the Eighth Annual Record of Assemblymen and Senators from the City of New York , compiled and published by the club just mentioned . From this pamphiet // we learn that one assemblyman " was born in Cork , Ireland , . . . and immigrated to this country when about seven years of age . He attended public schools . When about twenty-four years old he became a bar-tender in a saloon which he soon owned . He now has a saloon at 442 Washington Street . He is illiterate , shameless , *nd utterly unfit to represent the important district from which he comes . His record for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills which he introduced were strikes . " ( A " strike " is a measure brought forward simply for purposes of blackmail ; as , for example , a bill , introduced last year , reducing fares on the New York surface railways from five to three cents . ) Of another assemblyman we have the following account : " He received six or seven years ' schooling in the public schools of this city . His early associations were not good . He was employed in various newspaper delivery offices for several years . He afterwards became a liquor dealer , then an undertaker , then a liquor dealer again . Last year he called himself a lawyer , and this year a plumber . As a matter of fact , he has recently opened a new saloon at 35 Marion Street . He does not use tobacco nor drink intoxicating liquors . . . . He belongs to the worst class of bar-room politicians . He has engaged in street brawls , poses as a fighter , and is a typical New York tough . ' As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has been accused upon the floor of the House of using money to defeat certain bills . " One assemblyman " was born in New York city , of American parents . He was educated in the public schools , and was admitted to the bar . . . . He has no conception of his duties , and seems lack ing in ordinary intelligence .... He as sociated with and followed the lead of the most corrupt element in the legisla ture . The story of his unsuccessful jour* ney to an interior town , at much personal discomfort , for the purpose of demanding a sum of money for his vote in favor of a bill making a small appropriation for a charitable institution is public property . It is supposed that his simple-minded attempts to strike various interests will prevent his return to the assembly . " A better kind of legislator is described as follows : " He was born in New York city , of Irish parents . He was educated in parochial and public schools and the College of the City of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law at the same time . . . . He now has a law office . . . . He is an honest man , of considerable ability . His associates at Albany are good . He is Richard Crolcer 's pet assemblyman . . . . His record for the past session was bad so far as he was controlled by Tammany Hall . He voted for all its bills , whether of a political or private nature , and showed activity only when Tammany needed his services ; when Tammany interests were not involved , he was usually upon the right side . " This description of Mr. Croker 's " pet assemblyman " is , I think , highly significant . It will be observed that the pet assemblyman is just as honest and reputable a man as it is possible for him to be without neglecting the selfish interests of Tammany Hall and Mr. Croker . And such is the character of the whole government of the city of New York . It is as good , as effective , as honest a government as Mr. Croker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would doubtless consider injustice to himself and to his political constituents . Probably he thinks that any inhabitant of New York who fails to be satisfied with it is very ungrateful . Certainly it is as good as the citizens deserve . The Croker regime is far removed from the clumsy , thieving system of Tweed . Au analysis of the City Reform Club 's report , from which I have just quoted , shows that Tammany , on the whole , prefers men of the pet assemblyman type rather than of the type represented , for // instance , by the second character described above . Of the thirty assemblymen elected from the city of New York last year , twenty-nine were classed as Tammany Democrats . There was but one Independent Democrat , and not a single Republican . Of the twenty-nine Tammany Democrats , three were good men and good legislators ; fifteen were mere Tammany machines , not " personally dishonest ; " whereas only eleven are set down as inherently corrupt . The reason why Tammany Hall needs to be well represented at Albany is doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York is controlled very largely by the state legislature . For the past fifty years the city has been Democratic , excepting , I believe , one year only ; for the same period , with the exception of a year or two , the legislature has been Republican . The consequence of this state of things is stated by Mr. Godkin , Tammany 's acute and courageous opponent : " In order to protect themselves against the gross consequences of Democratic ignorance and corruption , Republicans have been compelled to fly to Albany and ask for some sort of temporary relief in the shape of special legislation . " And Mr. Godkin adds : " The strain on integrity which the situation creates on both sides is , in fact , greater than human nature can bear , even when it has not been trained in city politics . Nothing can well be more demoralizing for the country members of the legislature than the power to regulate the affairs of a wealthy community to which they do not belong , and whose interests they do not understand . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any community , than the discovery that it need not try persuasion on the majority in order to accomplish its ends ; that there is a power outside to which it can appeal to enable it to have its way when elections go against it . " The state legislature , then , and not the aldermen , constitutes the real legislative body of the city . There are no common councilmen , and the aldermen have very little power ; their business is chiefly to regulate the use of highways and sidewalks , to make ordinances about awnings , etc . Even for the laying out of a new street recourse must be had to Albany . The " boodle " aldermen , whose trials created so much excitement a few years ago , were aldermen who had been bribed to give a charter to a surface railway ; but such rights are now required by law to be sold at public auction . Since 1884 , the aldermen have not even had the power of confirming or rejecting the mayor 's appointments . Last year , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senate , and this very much simplified Mr. Croker 's task in directing legislation . He was able to pass or reject bills by telephone . The Capitol at Albany still continued in service , the City Hall at New York was also occupied by its customary tenants , but the real seat of municipal legislation was the wigwam on Fourteenth Street . I have spoken of the laws affecting New York which are passed at the capital ; and there is another way , also , in which Tammany , or rather the state " ring , " of which Tammany forms the chief part , is interested in Albany legislation . For many years the " striking " of individuals , and more especially of corporations , has been a recognized industry at Albany , as indeed it has been , though to a less extent , in most state capitals . A legislator " strikes " a corporation , as I have indicated , when he introduces some bill calculated to injure it directly or indirectly ; his purpose being , not to have the bill pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , also , corporations are forced to pay large sums for particular legislation which they desire , which may be , and often is , perfectly proper , and which a legislature not venal would grant without difficulty . It is generally believed that enormous sums // pass into the ring 's hands in this way . I know of one case where twenty-five hundred dollars were paid by a corporaltion for a small piece of legislation . I know of another case where fifteen thousand dollars were demanded for a similar but more important service . After much deliberation , and under the advice of able counsel , it was concluded to pay this sum , and nothing remained to be done except to send the cheque ; but at that stage of the negotiations the election of last November occurred . Tammany lost its majority in the legislature , and I presume , though I do not know , that the cheque was not sent . In still another case , Tammany demanded of a corporation doing an immense business in the State sixty thousand dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised by its counsel , an eminent member of the bar , to hand over the money . But here , again , the election of last November intervened , and caused , I believe , a hitch in the proceedings . These large payments are not made by shady individuals , or companies doing a doubtful business and advised by shyster attorneys ; they are made by the chief corporations in the State , acting under advice of the chief lawyers in the State . Last year , Tammany being in full possession of the legislature , this blackmailing business was thrown directly into the hands of the ring , and the result was described by the president of a great insurance company doing business in New York . " Formerly , " he said , " we had to keep a man at Albany to buy off the strikers ' one by one , but this year we simply paid over a lump sum to the ring , and they looked after our interests . " It should be said , moreover , that Tammany deals very honestly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Black Horse Cavalry ( as the strikers are called ) as faithfully as Rob Roy protected his clients from cattle-lifters on the Border . Such is one source of Tammany 's income , and the money derived from it is said to exceed a million dollars per annum . How much of it goes into the treasury of Tammany Hall , and how much into the pockets of the leaders , is not known . Neither the ring nor Tammany renders accounts . Tammany 's legitimate revenue consists chiefly of assessments levied upon candidates for office and upon office holders . Every one of the five thousand members of the General Committee pays an assessment , varying from five dollars to fifty dollars . Every candidate for an elective office pays a sum proportioned to the salary and length of term attached to the office . The city employees above the grade of laborer make annual contributions to Tammany . Another source of revenue is the contributions of liquor dealers . There are about thirty thousand men in New York engaged as principals or assistants in selling liquor over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost all of them help support Tammaiiy Hall . Still another , and perhaps even greater source of revenue is found in the criminal classes . Every gambling house , every house of prostitution , pays hush money through the police , and , it may be added , to the police.i It remains to state what power Tammany has to harass its enemies and to punish rebellious followers ; and this power is perhaps more valuable to it than any other . Certainly , without this power Tammany never could have acquired the firm grip which it now has upon the city . I have already reminded the reader of the fact that New York is governed chiefly through laws passed at Albany . In 1882 these laws were codified in one great act , called the Consolidation Act . An annotated edition of this act , with the subsequent additions and amendments , published in 1891 , Even this abuse has its advantage . The system tends to reduce the number of criminal resorts and to make them orderly . U p // makes a very bulky volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the aldermen make anotherlarge volume . Now , a citizen of New York , especially if he own any real estate , or if he be a builder or contractor , a tradesman , a stable keeper , a liquor dealer , or an inn keeper , does not know what his rights and duties are unless he has mastered these extensive works . Of course , as a matter of fact be has never seen them . But if he falls under the ban of Tammany , the police will soon begin to give him object lessons in city government . A few concrete instances , for the truth of which I can vouch , will suffice to show how this is done . Last spring there was employed in a certain livery stable a young man who had made himself somewhat conspicuous as an " anti-snapper , " - an opponent , for the time being at least , of Tammany . It was not long before the police began to drop in at that stable almost daily with various complaints and charges . The manure pit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately ; there were , it appeared , numerous sanitary regulations which the stable keeper had not complied with ; his plumbing was defective ; he must stop putting wagons in the street ( he had been doing this for years , to be sure , but still it was contrary to a city ordinance ) . In short , it soon became plain that the stable keeper must either go out of business , or dismiss the anti-snapper . He took the latter course , and the police troubled him no more . In another case , a Broadway hotel keeper , who refused a contribution to Tammany , suffered severely in a similar way . He became a prey to inspectors , who were continually requiring him to make this or that change in his building , at the same time suggesting that Soand-So would be a good man to do the job . His plumbing was always out of order , from a Tammany point of view ; his fire escapes were insufficient , etc . If the offender be a merchant , he is vulnerable not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also in respect to signs , awnings , obstruction of the sidewalk , obstruction of the street by wagons standing in front of his shop , and in various other ways . There was a junk dealer who owned several shops in different parts of the city . For some years it had been his practice to take out a single license , upon the theory that he was licensed as a dealer who might have one or more places of business . Tammany acquiesced in this interpretation of the law ; but when the junk dealer became recalcitrant politically , then indeed Tammany 's conscience was aroused , and thereafter that particular junk dealer was required to take out as many licenses as he had shops . An undertaker , to whom the city officials had been accustomed to direct a good deal of business , fell under suspicion , and Tammany gave him only one funeral in the course of a whole month . A lawyer was employed to collect a bill against the city , his client being the owner of a patented machine which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the justice of the claim , but various difficulties were thrown in the way , and it seemed impossible to get the city authorities to act upon it . Finally , the lawyer was given a hint that if he joined Tammany Hall the claim would be paid . A large manufacturing concern , still more a railroad company doing business in New York , must touch the city government at a hundred points , and correspondingly firm will be Tammany 's hold upon its president and directors . As to the liquor dealers , Tammany 's power over them is almost absolute . The excise law is complicated and extensive , and it can be held over the dealers like a whip . For example , it is illegal to sell liquor on Sunday , but in many , perhaps in most cases , the saloons have a back door open on that day . This is // done by connivance of the police , who can permit Sunday selling as a privilege , or prevent it as a punishment , according to the political or financial necessities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a regard for appearances compels them to make an arrest , they can nullify it , if they desire , by the weakness of their testiniony against the offender . This is illustrated by the following paragraph , which appeared last November in the city papers : " Five saloon keepers were arraigned before Justice Voorhis in Essex Market Court yesterday , but the evidence was so slight in each case that the justice said : These arrests are a farce . An officer makes an arrest , and does his utmost to have the case dismissed . I get no evidence on which to hold a defendant . They are all discharged . ' " There are many small extortions which Tammany can inflict for the benefit of its friends . Thus , it was formerly the practice in New York , as it is today in Boston , for the owners of private stables to sell the accumulated manure to some farmer , for so much a load . Tammany made a law that stable owners should not sell the manure , but , on the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they should employ for this purpose only such person or persons as were licensed by the city . Tammany went so far , in one case , as to send in a bill for removing manure from a stable which had been closed during the whole period covered by the bill . The owner protested against being forced to pay for the fictitious carting of imaginary manure ; but Tammany replied that if he did not use the stable it was his own fault . Tammany 's licensee was ready at all times to do his duty . Such , roughly sketched , is Tammany Hall . To show it in all its ramifications would require the pen of a Balzac . There is scarcely a passion or a weakness of human nature that Qoes not qualify its operations . Even the intrigues and jealousies of its women , their " social ambitions , " play a part in the politics of the city . Tammany includes the good and the bad ; it reaches the high and the low . There is probably not a peanut-vender pushing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperity do not depend upon its favor . On the other hand , it has determined , and may determine again , the presidency of the United States . Tammany is almost as old as a political club in this country could be . It is enriched by traditions of patriotism and good fellowship ; it touches its members and adherents upon many sides . It is wonderfully organized and disciplined . Its rank and file are mainly honest men . Tammany has great resources : it has the patronage of the city offices , and of all the laborers employed by the city , directly or indirectly ; it collects enormous sums by assessment of candidates and office holders , by blackmail of corporations and individuals , by tolls laid upon liquor dealers and criminals . It sits in the police courts . It has an immense power of harassing opponents and of disciplining rebellious followers , through the application of the city ordinances , of the excise laws , of sanitary , building , plumbing , and numberless other acts . This vast club , now practically synonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few men , - nay , by one man , - answerable to nobody . And yet he gives the city a fairly good , though tyrannical government . But even if it were extremely good , even if it did not involve blackmail and oppression , it is not the sort of government which we are supposed to tolerate in this country . Did we rebel against England , have we declared constitutions , made laws , organized a nation , in order that Mr. Richard Croker , or his successor in the office of Tammany Boss , might put his foot on our necks and keep it there ? That is the question which confronts the citizens of New York .
