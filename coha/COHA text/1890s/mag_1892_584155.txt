txt A NEW ENGLAND BOYHOOD . VI . THE WORLD NEAR BOSTON . THE Broad Street Riot , so called , on the afternoon of June 11 , 18*7 , was an event which of course had great interest for the boys of the period . It was the fortune of very few of them , however , who were decently brought up , to have any hand in that conflict ; for , as I have said in another chapter of these recollections , people in those days went to " meeting " as regularly in the afternoon as they did in the morning . If there should be need to-day for the sudden appearance of the military forces of Boston on a Sunday afternoon , I think that the officers of those forces would be looked for quite as readily at the Browning Club or a chess club , or possibly even exercising their horses somewhere within ten miles of Boston , as at any place of public worship . But my whole personal recollection of the Broad Street Riot is that , of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the gentlemen who were of the first regiment ros&amp; and left their seats , and went down to the armory at Faneuil Hall to join their companies , not to say lead them . It was said , and I believe truly , that a sergeant formed the first men who arrived , in skeletons of companies , and in a skeleton of a regiment . George Tyler Bigelow , afterwards chief justice of the Supreme Court , was the first commissioned officer who arrived . He was a lieutenant in the New England Guards or the Light Infantry . He ordered the regiment out of the armory , and commanded it till he met a superior officer . The story was that the command changed half a dozen times before the regiment reached Broad Street , where firemen and Irishmen were fighting . Of which I saw and remember nothing . But the departure of those gentlemen from church , whom we would have joined so gladly , fixed the whole affair in our memories . In a boy journal of the time , I find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Irish got well beaten , but the firemen appear to have been as much in the wrong as they . " In all these reminiscences , I am well aware that our lives were much less affected by the daily news from abroad than are the lives of people now . Cer 1892 . J // tainly Boston regarded itself more as a metropolis than it does now . And for this there was good reason ; for Boston had much less connection with the rest of the world than it has now . It had a foreign commerce , and the average boy expected to go to sea some time or other . But I recollect times when a vessel from England brought thirty-five days ' news ; all through the time of which I am writing , it took t*hree days for a letter to go to Washington ; and although people no longer offered prayers for their friends when they were going to New York , still a journey to New York was coinparatively a rare business . In my third year in college , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botanist in New York . There was no proper " express , " and I asked it as a personal favor of a young man named Harnden , whom I knew as a conductor on the Boston and Worcester railroad , that he would give the parcel to some one who would give it to some one else who would give it to my correspondent . It was because Mr. Harnden had so many such personal favors in hand that he established Hamden 's Express , which was , I think , the first of the organized expresses which existed in this country . I find it difficult to make the Boston boy or girl of to-day understand how different was Boston life , thus shut in from the rest of the world , from our life , when , as I suppose , at least one hundred thousand people enter Boston every day , and as many leave it for some place outside . As late as May , 1845 , when I was twenty-three years old , I had an engagement to go from Boston to Worcester Saturday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When , at three 1 As I write these memoranda , in September , 1892 , just as we have heard of Mr. Whittier 's death , there is a certain interest in saying that it was on this occasion that I first met him . As the handful of passengers entered the stage which was to take us to Lancaster , Mr. Whittier was one of the number . He did not tell o'clock , I came to the station of the Worcester road , there was an announcement that , from some accident on the line above , no train would leave until Monday . The three o'clock train , observe , was the latest train of Saturday . I crossed Boston to the Fitchburg station , and took the train for Groton or Littleton . There I took a stage for Lancaster , where I slept . ' In the morning , with a Worcester man who had been caught in Boston as I was , I took a wagon early , and we two drove across to Worcester . That is to say , as late as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was necessary that they should go to Worcester that afternoou . And this was ten years after railroad communication had been established . Before railroad communication was open , intercourse with other States , or with what now seem neighboring cities , was very infrequent . In 1832 , my father went to Schenectady to see the Albany and Schenectady railroad , and , I believe , to order some cars for the Boston and Worcester road . He also went to New York city on the business of that road . I think he had been to that city but once since 1805 , when he went there on his way from Northampton to Troy . It is a tradition in the family that he was then a fortnight on the sloop which carried him up the Hudson River from New York , and that he read the whole of Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire on that voyage . Yet , if anybody , was to travel , he would have been apt to . He was a journalist , intensely interested in internal improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was well known there . I was myself nineteen years old when I first visited New York . his name to any one , and it was many years before I knew that he was one of those whose pleasant conversation enlivened the dark ride . I can hardly say that I saw him ; but he was kind enough afterwards always to remember that I mnhde his acquaintance on that occasion . // Tn 1841 , I had a chance to overhaul the old register at the hotel at Stafford Springs , in Connecticut . Stafford Springs was , and is , a watering-place of a modest sort , where is a good strong iron spring , - good for boys with warts , and indeed for any one who needs iron in his blood . It was quite the fashion to go to Stafford Springs from different parts of New England , in the earlier part of the century . In this old register , it was interesting to see how universal was the custom by which people came there in their own carriages . What followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hardly traveled for pleasure at all . So was it that , in the years of my boyhood , Boston people , with very few exceptions , lived in Boston the year round . People did not care to go to the theatre in midsummer , and I think the theatres were generally closed for six or eight weeks when the days were longest . Perhaps Boston used the matchless advantages of her bay more when she had little communication with points beyond it . Perhaps the entertainments of the bay seemed more important because there were few , if any , excursions for pleasure excepting those which the water offered . Nahant was seized upon as a seashore resort as early as 1819 . The sea serpent had appeared in 1817 . The hotel on the southeastern point , long since burned down , was a pretty piazza-guarded building ; and , as the steamboat Housatonic went down to Nahant every morning , and came back every night , a day at Nahant made a charming summer expedition , which we young folks relied upon at least once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nantasket , at Sandwich , and at Gloucester I made my acquaintance with the real ocean . At Nahant I made my first acquaintance with the joy of the bowling alley , and first saw the game of billiards . By the way , I remember that , in lecturing to my class in college , as late as 1837 , Professor Lovering had to tell the class , as a faat which half of them did not know , that when one billiard-ball strikes another it may stop itself , while it communicates its motion to the other . I doubt if half the young men who heard him had ever seen a billiard-table at that time . There were but one or two steamboats in the harbor , so that the " excursion " of to-day was vevy infrequent . But all the more would people go down the bay for fishing-parties , on sailingvessels , - more , I should think , than they do now . Perhaps there was something in foreign commerce which gave to those engaged in it a sort of absolute freedom sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate remission of work and play , which the modern merchant seldom enjoys . Your ship came in from Liverpool or from Calcutta , and you and all your staff , down to the boy who swept out the office and trimmed the lamps* were busy , morning , noon , and night , till her cargo was disposed of , and perhaps till she was fitted for another voyage . But then , if no other of your ships arrived , there would be a lull ; and if Tom , Dick , or Harry came in to propose a fishing-party , you were ready . However this may be , the history and experiences of such parties made a considerable element of summer life . The anecdote of General Morean belongs to them , and I will print it , though it is told of a generation before my time . When General Moreau was in exile from France , he came on his travels to Boston . Among other entertainments he was taken down the bay on * fishing-party . As they dined , or after dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , was asked to favor the company with a song , and he sang the fine old English song of ToMorrow . The refrain is in the words , - " To-morrow , to-morrow , - Will be everlasting to-morrow . " // The French exile did not understand English as well as he did the art of war , and when Colonel Messenger cank to these words , at the end of each verse , he supposed , naturally enough , that he was hearing a song made in his own honor . " To Morean , to Morean Je n'entends pas bien mais to Moreau . " And so he rose , as each verse closed , put his hand to his heart , blushed , and bowed gratefully , as to a personal compliment . And his hosts were too courteous to undeceive him . The Harvard Navy Club , an institution long since dead , used to " go down , " as the abbreviated phrase was , every year . " Go down " was short for " go down the bay and fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who received no college honors . The laziest man in a class was the " Lord High Admiral ; " the next to the laziest was the " Admiral of the Blue , " and so on . Perhaps there are not so many fish in the bay as there were then . Perhaps I am not so much interested in the boys who take them . But I do not see , when I cross the bridge to East Cambridge , any boy patiently sitting on the rail waiting to catch flounders , as I have done many a happy afternoon . Perhaps , as civilization has come in , the flounders have stayed lower down the bay . Traveling , in short , was done by retail in those days , and such combinations as those of to-day , by which a hundred thousand people are thrown upon Boston daily , and as many taken away , were wholly unknown , not to say not dreamed of . Retail traveling , if we are to use that expression , had some points of interest which do not enliven the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train with three hundred and ninetynine others , all of their to be delivered , " right side up with care , " at the place they wish to go to , while none of them have what Mr. Locke would call an " adequate idea " of the places on the way , if indeed any of them have any idea . The first of such expeditions which I remember , excepting one on the Middlesex Canal , which has been referred to , was in August and September of 1826 , when my father took all of us - that is , my mother and four children - to Sandwich , where he was going to enjoy a week 's shooting . The other gentlemen of the party were Daniel Webster , Judge Story , and Judge Fay . Mr. Webster took his family with him ; I think the other gentlemen did not take theirs . All of us stayed at Fessenden 's tavern ; charmingly comfortable then , I fancy , as I know it was afterwards . My early memories of the expedition are quite distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun which is the oldest sporting gun here at Matunuck ; and a good gun it is , if people are not above an old-fashioned percussion cap . But in those days it had a flintlock . The general use of what are now unknown to young sportsmen , percussion caps , belongs some years later . The bigger boys , Fletcher Webster and my brother Nathan , would be taken out with the gentlemen to hold the horses ( in chaises , observe ) on the beach , while their fathers walked about and shot what they might . But we little fellows stayed at home , to be lifted to the seventh heaven if a loaded gun were brought home at night whicWwe might aim and fire at a shingle . For us and the girls , the principal occupation I remember was playing dinner and tea with the pretty glassware which the Sandwich works were just beginning to make . I believe I have somewhere at this day some specimens of their work for children . On this expedition , we went and returned , some in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaise , - making the journey , I think , in a day . But generally , with so large a host as ours , - which included Fullum , - we went on the summer journey , whatever it was , in what was then , as it is indeed now , called a " baronche. " rJ7he names " lan // dau , " " victoria , " and the like were , I think , unknown . As this business was by no means peculiar to our family , and as it belongs to a civilization quite unlike ours , I will describe it in detail . We were to go to Cape Ann , and for perhaps a week to take such comfort as the great " tavern " at Gloucester would give . Observe that the word " tavern " was still used , as I think it now is where a tavern exists iii the heart of New England , for what the Englishman calls an " inn . " We talk now of the Wayside Inn , the Wayland Inn , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indeed foreign speech introduced from England within a generation past . To prepare for such an expedition , Fullum would be sent from stable to stable to hire the best barouche he could find , and a span of horses . Happy the boy who selected himself , or was selected by destiny , to accompany him on this tour of inspection ! When the happy morning arrived , Fullum brought round his carriage and horses early , fastened on the trunk behind , - for I think there never was but one , - and the two elders , and in this ease of Cape Ann the five children , with books and hand baggage , always with maps of the country , were packed away in and on the carriage . Both of ns boys , of course , sat on the box with Fullum , who drove . If , on any such occasion , there were a very little boy , Fullum would arrange a duplicate set of reins for the special use of the youngster , which were attached , not the horses ' bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular expedition to Cape Ann , we stopped at the Lynn Mineral Spring Hotel , long since abandoned , I think , and reached Gloucester only perhaps on the second day . What happened to the old people there , I am sure I do not know . To us children , there were those ineffable delights of playing with the ocean , the kindest , safest , and best playmate which any child can have . Sandwich had given us only the first taste of it . Here we had our first real knowledge of what seaurchins are , and what people call " sand dollars , " horseshoe crabs , cockles , ray 's eggs , and the various seaweeds , from devil 's aprons up or down . The cape had not assumed the grandeur of a summer watering-place . The modern names were unknown . There was no Rockport or Pigeon Cove to go to . It was Sandy Bay or Squam to which one drove . I remember the ejaculation of some fishermen 's children , as they saw the barouche for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail , and it ai n't a shay . " At that time , and certainly as late as 1842 , a group of children in the country , if they saw a carriage approaching , would arrange themselves hastily in a line oii one side of the road and " make their manners . " That is , they would all bow as the carriage passed . The last time that I remember seeing this was in 1842 , in Hampshire County , as the stage passed by . It was done good-naturedly , with no sign of deference , but rather , I should say , as a pleasant recognition of human brotherhood in a lonely region ; as two men , if they were not Englishmen , might bow to each other , wherever they were far from other men . In our particular family , the annual journey was made to my grandfather 's house in Westhampton , a pleasant town among the hills in Hampshire County , where my father was born . He took his wife there in his chaise when they were married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1837 , when he did not make the same journey with his whole family . This then nunibered seven children , beside himself and my mother , and of course Fullum . To my father , it was a matter of pride that on the last of these journeys we went on his own railroad to Worcester . In 1835 , the carriage was taken on a truck on the passenger train , in which we rode ; but I need not say that Fullum preferred to sit in the carriage all the way , and did so // There was a charm in such half-vagrant journeying , about which the Raymond tourist knows nothing . There was no sending in advance for rooms , and you took your chances at the tavern , where you arrived , perhaps , at nine o'clock at night . It may be imagined that the sudden appearance at the country tavern of a party of ten , of all ages , from three months upward , was an event of interest . In those times , the selectmen knew what they meant when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for travelers . Practically , it was a convenience to any village to have a place where travelers could stay ; and practically , the people of that village said to the man whom they licensed to sell liquor , " If you have this privilege , you must provide a decent place of entertainment for strangers . " One man kept the tavern , perhaps , for his life long . It had its reputation as good or poor ; and you avoided certain towns because So-andSo did not keep a good house . The practical difficulty of such traveling in New England now is , that you are by no means sure of finding a comfortable place to sleep , when your day 's journey is over . The New England tavern of the old fashion held its own to the most advantage , in later times , in the State of Maine , on the roads back into the lumber region ; and I dare say such comfortable houses for travelers may be found there now . These country taverns always had signs , generally swinging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The sign might be merely the name of the keeper ; this was a sad disappointment to young travelers . More probably it was the picture of the American eagle or of a rising sun . Neptune rising from the sea was a favorite device . I remember at Worcester the Elephant , and I have seen the portrait of General Wolfe on the Newburyport tavern , and more than one General Washington . After I was a man , I had occasion to travel a good deal , one summer , in northern Vermont , where the tavern signs still existed . Almost without exception , their devices were of the American eagle with his wings spread , or of the American eagle holding the English lion in chains , or of the lion chained without any American eagle . These were in memory of Macomb 's and Chauncey 's victories at Plattsburg and on the lake . They also , perhaps , referred to the fact that most of these taverns were supported by the wagons of smugglers , who , in their good large peddlers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they sold on our side of the line . In our generation , one is more apt to see a tavern sign in a museum than hanging on a gallows-tree . Meandering along through Leicester , Spencer , Belchertown , Ware , Amherst , Northampton , or some of these places , we arrived at my grandfather 's pretty home in Westhampton on the morning of the third day . Then , for three or four days came absolute and infinite joy . We had cousins there , just our own ages , of whom we were very fond . For the time of our visit they gave themselves , without stint or hindrance , to the entertainment of their friends from Boston . First of all , horses were to be provided , and saddles , that we boys might ride . Little did the country boys understand what joy it was to us to find ourselves scampering over the hills . Then there was the making of traps for woodchucks . If it c*iose to rain , we were in the great workshop of the farm , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the evening there were " hunt the slipper " and " blindman 's buff , " the latter an entertainment which we could follow even on Sunday evening , as I believe I have said , and follow then with more enthusiasm than on other evenings , because other cousins and the children of neighbors came in to join with us . In that New England parsonage , - never so // called , by the way , - the old Connecticut customs prevailed , and " the Sabbath " began promptly as the sun went down on Saturday night , and was well ended when the sun set on Sunday . The hills of Westhampton are high , and sunset on Sunday evening came early . So it was that the great joy of life was the visit at grandfather 's every summer . My grandfather was the minister of this town for fifty-seven years . I think I saw the dear old gentleman last in 1834 ; it must have been in 1837 , after his death , that we made the last visit there , when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Westhampton for fifty years , when it was to preach in his pulpit . It was pleasant to find that , after two generations , the people of the town remembered him fondly . I found the pulpit of the meeting-house and the chancel behind it decorated with flowers , and the word " Welcome , " wrought in flowers , hung above me . So I went back to the happiest days of my New England boyhood . I have already alluded to the infrequency of communication between this country home - for it was such to all of us children - and the home in Boston . The cousins in the country , when autumn came , would not forget us in Boston , and would crack butternuts and walnuts for us , of kinds they*thought we should not have , pick out the great meats , and pack them carefully to be sent down . Such a box would be sent to Northampton , and put on board a boat which went to Hartford . There it would be put on board a sloop , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Cape Cod to Boston . In the same sloop was perhaps a keg of my grandmother 's apple-sauce , or some other treasure from the farm . Great joy for us , if all these pleasant memorials arrived in time ; great sorrow , if a letter came , stating that the sloop was frozen up opposite Lyme , or somewhere else in the Connecticut River , and would not appear with its precious cargo until the next spring . Such were the difficulties of sending a box a hundred and ten miles across Massachusetts in the year 1830 . To putting an end to such difficulties by the railroad system my father gave much of the active part of his life , as I have before said . When it was thought crazy to talk about such things , he talked about the possibilities of a railroad westward . When it was necessary to induce men of capital to subscribe , with infinite difficulty he obtained a subscription of a million dollars capital for the Boston and Worcester railroad . He was the first president and first superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first engine from Liverpool . This , as I have said , was the Meteor ; she was ordered from George Stephenson himself , immediately after the success of the Rocket in the famous railway trial between Liverpool and Manchester in 1830 . The arrival of the Meteor in Boston , with the engine-driver who was to set her up and to run her first trips , was a matter of great joy to us boys . At the same time , the Yankee was built by a company in Boston , at their works at the cross-dam of the Milldam ; and an engine always called the " Colonel Long " was built for the Boston and Worcester railroad at Philadelphia , under the auspices of the same Colonel Long who gave the name to Long 's Peak at the West . He was in the engineer service of the United States , and this engine was built to burn anthracite coal . The Meteor was at once set up in Boston , and started on her experimental trips . It is easy to see how much this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , equally , how much it would interest their sons . The engine-driver was good to my brother and me , and we had the great pleasure of making some of the earliest of her trips with him . I have spoken of the opening of the road to West Newton . I think they must still have there the sign which // was put up on Davis 's hotel , representing the engine and car of the period . It ought to be preserved in some historical collection there . Boston roused itself to the new interest , and every afternoon eight cars went out to Newton and back , that people might say they had ridden on the new railroad . Many a straw hat was burned through by the cinders which lighted upon it , and many notions were gained for the future . What is now called the American system was first tried in the cars built for the Worcester railroad at Worcester , by the founder of the present firm of Bradley . The suggestion was made , I be lieve , by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old system , in which the conductor ran around on a platform on the outside . I remember , as among the close approaches to death which in any man 's life stand out distinctly , that , when I was in college , I ran after a train on which I was to go to Natick , sprang upon it when in motion , and felt myself falling . I supposed that the last instant of my life had come , while I fell for the first few inches . Then I found myself astride of the long , narrow platform on which I had intended to stand . Risks like this were what all the conductors of the early railroads ran ; and I suppose , indeed , the English guards may have to run them , to a certain extent , to the present day . The Boston and Worcester station in 1833 , and for some time after , was on the ground now occupied by Indiana Street and by Brigham 's milk depot , between Washington Street and Tremont Street . Tremont Street had just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was at the instance of the Worcester railroad that its grade was raised , many years after , and that company was obliged to take the cost of lifting the houses which had been built on the lower level . It is to that change of level that we owe it that the whole South End of Boston is now built on the level above the marsh , instead of being built , as the few houses originally on it were , scarcely above the level of high tide . VII . THE WORLD BEYOND BOSTON . All boys , from the nature of their make-up , are great politicians . The boys of sixty years ago were not unlike boys of to-day in this matter , and , when an election day came around , we were glad to spend as much time as we could at the places where people were voting . Happy the boy to whom some vote-distributer would give a handful of votes , and happier he who could persuade some one to take a ballot from those which he had given to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the time when a certain superstition held in Massachusetts by which every ballot was written . Early in the century , gentlemen interested in an election would call on the women of the family , if they could write well , to write out ballots which could be used at the polls . But I never saw such written ballots . The separation between Boston and the rest of the world affected a good deal the political combinations . I do not suppose that our present compact system of national political parties could possibly exist without the convenience of the telegraph and the railroad . I should say , historically , that it began in the great convention of young men which was held in the city of Baltimore , in the year 1840 , by way of advancing the election of President Harrison . Independent and sovereign as Massachusetts was , in the election of 1836 , her National Republicans , as they called thenmselves , nominated Mr. Webster as candidate for President , though nobody else nominated him , and the electoral votes of Massachusetts were given for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American party would // hesitate before they should make such a separate demonstration now . And this habit of separation shows itself more distinctly in the newspapers of the time . I have already said that I was a great deal in the printing-office of the Daily Advertiser , which my father edited , as well as in his book-office . He maintained with care and interest the old system of apprenticeship , and always had one or more bright boys , whom he had taken into his office that they might learn the whole art and mystery of printing and what concerned the publication of a newspaper . One of these young men , to whose counsels and help we boys were largely indebted , still lives , honored in the community where he has been known for many years , as the director of the Barustable Patriot , - Mr. Sylvanus Phinney . To have a boy a little older than yourself as your comrade in the office , to have him show you what you could handle and what you could not handle , was in itself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I can a newspaper story , not of my boyhood , but of girlhood in Boston . In the year 1820 , the convention met which revised the constitution of Massachusetts . The Advertiser published the full report of the proceedings , and this report was made up in my father 's workroom , in the lower story of the house in Tremont Street . He was suffering at that time from an accident by which he nearly lost the sight of one of his eyes , and all his writing was done at home by my mother . So it would happen of an evening that the gentlemen most interested in the convention would look in at the house to revise the reports of their own speeches , and perhaps to consult about the work of the next day . Mr. Webster and Judge Story were two of the prominent leaders of that convention . They were on terms of the closest intimacy at our house , and would come in almost every evening for this purpose . Mother would be sitting in the room to do any writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called away to the baby of the time , the baby lay asleep in the cradle while the work of dictation went on . Speeches were made , proofs corrected , baby rocked , and undoubtedly a great deal of the fun of such bright young people passed to and fro with every evening . Afterwards , in friendly recognition of the hard night-work of the winter , when the convention was well over , and its proceedings were published in a volume which is now one of the cherished nuggets of the collectors , mother had a great cake made for the workmen at the office . She frosted it herself , and dressed it with what in those days they used to call " cockles " of sugar . These cockles generally had little scraps of poor verses , which were supposed to be entertaining . But iii this case she had cut out from the proofs the epigrams of the convention debates , and as the apprentices and journeymen ate their cake they found , to their amusement , that the work of their own hands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day thinks he is much ahead of the journalist of that time , and in many regards he is ; but there were certain excitements which belonged to newspaper life then which do not belong to it now . The day when the Sirius arrived in Boston , the first in the line of Cunard vessels which have arrived regularly from that day to this , was one of these exciting days . My father went over in person upon the Sirius , talked with the officers , and came back with English *ewspapers almost as late as he had ever seen . I say " almost as late , " because the passage of the Sirius was , I think , twenty days , and we had traditions in the office of rapid runs of Baltimore clippers or other fast yessels which had come over in less time . It was after this that , in a winter passage , // the Great Western at New York brought news which was thirty-five days later than the latest news which we had from Europe . In earlier times there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other . Under such circumstances , the newspaper editor depended much more upon his foreign correspondent than he does now . The foreign correspondent of today digests news of which he knows the details have already gone by telegraph . He is in some sort a foreign editor , but he does not expect to send the detail of news . And there was an element of chance about the arrival of sailing-vessels which added to the curiosity of your morning paper . In our office , Mr. Ballard , who had the charge of the ship news , might board a vessel below in the harbor , whose captain had no idea that he had brought the latest news . Then this poor captain would be beset to hunt up every newspaper that he had on board . Perhaps he had been so foolish that he had not bought the last paper of the day on which he started . Whether he had or had not , it was the business of the boat which boarded him first to get every paper he had , so that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence . Perhaps all these papers arrived at the office but a little while before you went to press ; then it was your business to make the best show you could of the news , and possibly it was your good fortune to be able to say that no other paper had it . I remember that we had the news of the French Revolution of 1830 , which threw Charles X. from the throne , on a Sunday morning . When such things happened , the foreman in the office made up what was really an " Extra " by throwing together , as quickly as he had them in type , a few galleys of the news ; in that case , probably rapidly translated from the French papers . Then these galleys would be struck off on a separate handbill , and such handbills were circulated as " Extras . " And it is to this habit that the present absurd nomenclature is due by which one buys every day an " Extra " which is published at a certain definite time . All this is fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from " meeting " on that particular Sunday , I was told the news that there was another revolution in France , and had the " Extra " given me to carry down to Summer Street , where one of my uncles lived . There is a certain picturesqueness about the receipt and delivery of news , when it comes in such out-of-theway fashions , which the boy or girl of to-day finds it hard to understand . Of course , with type as much as we wanted , and all the other facilities for home printing , we printed our own newspapers . I do not think that at our house we did it so much as boys would to whom the making - up of a newspaper was not a matter of daily observation , involving a good deal of errand-running and other work which was anything but play . But we older boys had the Fly , which was our newspaper , and my brother Charles , not long after , started the Coon in the midst of the Harrison campaign , which survived for a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fly is that which m*ecords the death of Lafayette , in 1836 . We had not type enough then to print more than one page at a time . Three pages of the Fly had been printed , and the fourth was still to be set up , when the news of Lafayette 's death arrived . This was too good a paragraph to be lost , and we knew we could anticipate every other paper in Boston by inserting it . But , unfortunately , the n 's had given out . We had turned upside down all the u 's we had , and they also had given out . Also , still more unfortunately for printers in this difficulty , Lafayette had chosen to die of an " influenza , " which disease was at that moment asserting // itself under that name in France . It had not yet been called " la grippe , " which would have saved us . We succeeded in announcing the death of " the good , generous , noble Lafayette , " although " generous " needed one n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last n 's . The paragraph went on to say that the death was " caused by , " and the last u was devoured by " caused . " Then came the word " influenza. " * The boldest held his breath for a time . " But we were obliged ignominiously to go to press with the statement that his death was " caused by a cold . " This was safe , and required no n and no u . Alas ! in the making-up of the form the precious n of the word " noble " fell out ; and any library which contains a file of the Fly will show that its last statement to the world is that " the good , generous , oble Lafayette has died ; his death being caused by a cold . " Such are the exigencies of boy printers in all times . I have gone into detail as to the communications between the people in the country and the people who lived in Boston , in the hope of making the reader feel distinctly the isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That isolation has left its marks on the character of Boston till this day . It explains the amusing cockneyisms of Boston which make other people laugh at us , and a certain arrogance of provincialism which crops out , very oddly among people who have sons and daughters in every part of the world , and whose communication is now so free in every direction . " In the beginning it was not so . " The people of Boston had a very large foreign trade from its origin till comparatively recent times . Now they have a little , and half their population is of a stock which came very recently from Europe . But in the beginning of this century there was very little mimigration from Europe . Indeed , what there was was lo*ked upon with a cer tam distrust . About the time I went to college , or a little later , a society of the most intelligent people in Boston was organized for the express purpose of keeping out foreign " immigration . " We purists made a battle against that word . Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college theme with the same bitterness with which Mr. Webster resented " in our midst , " - a phrase which , I believe , you may now find in the Atlantic Monthly . ' One of the most intelligent gentlemen in Boston was appointed to the business of keeping out immigrants , - a business which can only be compared to Mrs. Partington 's determination to sweep out the tide when it was rising in the English Channel ! He had his office on Long Wharf , and wrote and forwarded circulars to Ireland to explain to the people of Ireland that they had better not come to this country . At the same moment , the very people who paid his salary were building up a system of manufacturing and internal improvements which was actually impossible without the immigration which they had appointed him to check . There was at that time , however , a distinct determination on the part of the best people in Boston that it should be absolutely a model city . They had Dr. Channing preaching the perfectibility of human nature ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ should work its miracles among all sorts and conditions of men ; they had a system of public education which they meant to press to its very best ; and they had all the money which was needed for *nything good . These men subscribed their money with the greatest promptness for any enterprise which promised the elevation of human society . In speaking of the lecture system , I have already stated their notion that if For the first and the last time . - En . ArLA*TIC MONTHLY . // people only knew what was right they would do what was right . So they founded first the Massachusetts Hospital , then its annex for the insane ; then they made the State contribute to the deafand-dumb asylum in Hartford ; they established their asylum for the blind at South Boston . Indeed , they expected to trample out every human ill , exactly as the most optimistic young medical expert in New York , at the moment when I write these lines , expects to trample out every cholera bacillus who shall present his little head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What these excellent people might have done , had Boston remained the funny little town it was in the year 1820 , I do not know . But it did not remain any such place . The population was then 43,298 ; in 1830 it was 61,392 . The increase in ten years is forty-one per cent of the population at the first enumeration , - an increase which would be thought very remarkable in the growth of any old city now . It indicates great prosperity . In the same ten years the population of the city of New York increased from 123,706 to 202,589 , an increase of sixtyfour per cent . Such figures should be remembered , by the way , by people who tell us that the present rate of the increase of cities is without precedent . The growth , though rapid , and on the whole encoui4aging for the manufacturing system of New England , tended to divert capital to a certain extent from that foreign commerce which had been created and nourished by European wars . So soon as capital placed itself in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester , Fall River , Holyoke , and the rest came into existence , so soon , of course , the Boston boy found out that there was a world outside of State Street and Milk Street . And now that Boston capital loves to place itself at any point where capital is needed , between Lockwood 's Cape in 820 north latitude and Terra del Fuego on the outside of the Strait of Magellan , there is no longer an opportunity for a Boston boyhood to be spent in the conditions which surrounded me . These were physically almost the same as those which surrounded the boyhood of Samuel Sewall in the seventeenth century , or Henry Knox in the eighteenth .
