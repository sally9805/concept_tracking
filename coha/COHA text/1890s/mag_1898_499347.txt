BUILDING UP A WORLD 'S FAIR IN FRANCE . BY BARON PIERRE DE COUBERTIN . NOT long since I read in a French news* paper that the Emperor William , while studying in detail the conduct of the SpanishAmerican war , had been particularly impressed by the excellence of the citizen soldiery of the United States and by the efficient aid which they rendered the regular troops . This , however , was no surprise to me , for I have long been of the opinion that , even in the art of war , the thousand and one complications with which the Old World is saddled are in no wise indispensable , and that , although it may not he possible to improvise soldiers , there should be little difficulty in making good soldiers out of free citizens . In short , we see that though Europe , through all phases of national existence , has remained complicated , America has retained its original simplicity , which , indeed , is the chief characteristic of transatlantic civilization , and gives it just that plasticity , that possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a civilization superior in many points to ours . Never , it would seem , Las that quality of simplicity- or , better , that talent for simplification-been brought into sharper relief than in the preparations for the exposition at Chicago . This undertaking was a colossal one . It was necessary to raise large sums of money for preliminary expenses , and to establish at once the entire executive machinery , from the highest officials down to the very guards who were to insure the // security of the exhibits as well as the personal safety of the visitors ; it was necessary to find a suitable site for the exposition , to arrange for proper facilities of transportation , as well as to attract architects and artists ; and all this had to be done quickly , not only because time was short , but because other cities equally rich and ambitious were ready to turn to their own account any weakness on the part of Chicago to the extent , even , of supplanting her , if possible . Most of the Europeans who gazed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy and perseverance displayed by the citizens who were at the head of that gigantic undertaking . For the government , as is well known , lent but little aid ; it was the citizens who banded together and gave the word to create the World 's Fair , and who pledged themselves to insure its successa very simple and straightforward method , and one which differs widely from those employed in Europe , and especially in France . One can almost say that France has a monopoly of the international exhibitions of the Old World , for she has been for nearly fifty years the only nation to arrange and conduct them with any degree of regularity . The first was held in England , the second in Vienna , and the next at Brussels ; but in France only have they succeeded one another at regular intervals or been conducted on the grandest scale . In view of these facts , a description of how a world 's fair is built up here in CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW PALACES-CHAMPS *LYSEES. 115 // France may not be without interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to parliamentary vote a proposal to the effect that there be held an exposition and that the necessary funds be subscribed . The city of Paris shoulders most of the expenses , in view of the fact that her budget is sufficiently large to enable her to do so , and that , later , her share of the profits will naturally be considerable . There is , then , an understanding between the government and the municipality , which , however , is never completed without much powwowing , in spite of the fact that questions of time and place never form a part of the discussion . Since 1855 , the date of our first exposition , they have always followed one another at intervals , first of twelve , since of eleven , years . Those o 1867 and 1878 recalled no events of particular interest . By a fortunate chance it has happened that not only did the date of the last exposition fall upon an interesting anniversary , but that of the coming one will do so *s well . In 1889 the centenary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the 6entury . In 1855 Napoleon III ordered the construction of the recently destroyed Palais de l'Industrie , which , unfortunately , was badly placed on the Champs Elys6es ; but beginning with 1867 the expositions ha e always been held in the Champ de Mar . As is well known , the Champ de Mars is an historic place . There , at the outset of the Revolution , was held the famous Fete de la F6d6ration , over which Louis XVI presided , and during which he solemnly swore fidelity to the constitution which the States-General had just adopted . It was there also that Napoleon I , after his return from Elba and on the eve of his departure for Waterloo , distributed among his army the standards capped with imperial eagles , and proclaimed 1'Acte additionnel , which established a sort of constitutional empire . The Champ de Mars , although fortunately situated near the center of Paris , has , however , become too small for the requirements of an exposition , thus creating the necessity for annexes along the Seine , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movements of carriages and pedestrians in that quarter of the city . Once the parliamentary decree is passed , a comniis ai , e-g*n&amp;al is appointed , the architectural competitions are opened , and official invitations are sent out to the various foreign powers . This cominissaire-g6n*ral is a functionary the necessity of whose existence is not at first sight apparent . He is , in short , a veritable minister , who quickly surrounds himself with as many various functionaries and as many different bureaus as he deems necessary . He holds office not // only during the exposition , but before , dur* ing the period of preparation , and afterwar during the period of liquidation . Although we know from the example of the United States that all this is not necessary in order to succeed , we do not seem to have profited by the lesson taught by Chicago , for never before have functionaries and complications of every description flourished to such a degree as now . The ault is due in part to the methods employed by he present commissaire-general , M. Picard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but practical , and in part to the fact that the exposition of 1900 has been planned so far ahead that actually too much time has been given in which to prepare for it . The exposition of 1867 had at its head the celebrated economist and sociologist Fr6d*ric Le Play , whom Napoleon III made a senator , and who developed plans for the most part along simple lines . In the center of the Champ de Mars he constructed an enormous ellipse , in which each country occupied a section , while each variety of product was shown in one of the elliptical galleries . Following around in this manner the gallery of agriculture , one was enabled to examine in sucession the agricultural products of the entire world-as , for instance , in passing through the Russian or Austro-Hungarian section , one found colle ted together all the various exhibits of those countries . In the development of his plans Le Play had very little time at his disposal . This was also the case in 1878 ; for the disaster of 1870 , followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic , left little time for the consideration of a similar artistic and historical manifestation . // The attitude of the principal monarchies of Europe toward the exposition of 1889 , in refusing to assist at the celebration of the centenary of the Revolution , dampened the ardor of the French , and even until 1888 there was talk of changing the date so that it might not fall upon 1889 . This time , however , no such obstacle has arisen , for a long period of peace and a feeling of quasi-certitude that this peace will not be disturbed before the end of the century have made it possible to begin the preparations early . The commissaire-g6n6ral already has been in office for nearly five years , and it is almost two years since the Czar Nicholas II laid the first stone of the splendid bridge which is to connect the two sections of the exposition . On the ground formerly occupied by the Palais de l'Jndustrie , and on that adjoining it , may already be seen the silhouettes of two new palaces , one of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other being designed to accommodate the horse-show and the agricultural and industrial departments . Between these two buildings will sweep a magnificent avenue , down which the President , looking from the windows of the Elys6e , may see , across the new bridge , the gilded dome of the Invalides , the tomb of Napoleon . In many points this avenue will resemble Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington , and , though not so long , it will be thickly shaded . These two palaces , which are being built of stone and marble , are , of course , intended for permanent structures ; whereas others , already completed , are of a more ephemeral nature , some being designed not for the exposition proper , but merely to be utilized during the period of preparation . Among these is the Bureau de l'Exposition , a long two-story building placed at the angle on the corner of the Avenue Rapp and the quay adjoining the Pontdel'Alma . Painted alight green , ornamented with friezes and balconies of carved wood , with both fa√ßades decorated by frescos of multicolored arabesques , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary buildings , RUINS OF " LA coua DES cOMPTES , " WHERE THE NEW RAILROAD STATION WILL BE EEEcTED. // qwq // IN TIlE WAITING-ROOM OF THE COMMISSAIRE-G*NfRAL OF THE EXPOSITION . THE SCHEMERS. // meetings end in harangues and discussions ; that is the way they begin , but they end quite differently . Hardly is a committee complete before a meeting is held and a president , several vice-presidents , and a few secretaries are elected . Full of enthusiasm , they pose questions , draw up circulars , and formulate all sorts of plans , which , of course , are carefully recorded by one or two of the commissaire-g6n*ral 's secretaries , who are always present at these meetings , and which later are forwarded to headquarters . On discovering the amount of work before it , each committee takes fright ; for its members , being for the most part professors , doctors , and literary men , find it impossible to devote much of their time to affairs of such a nature . The committee then resolves itself into subcommittees , who assemble once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries ; and so it goes until little by little this beautiful organization suffers an eclipse from which it never recovers , and continues its existence on paper only . All this is extremely interesting , for even in this little sphere of exposition bureaus one comes face to face with the immense problem which weighs so heavily upon Europe , and in particular upon France , i. e. , the difficulty we old Continental nations have in adopting democratic methods  --  the perpetual strife between the democracy and the administration . These committees represent democracy ,  --  public opinion directly associated with the government in the formation of iaws ,  --  although in reality their functions are merely formal , for they are able to give only perfunctory advice ; the balance of the organization presupposing a definitely centralized and disciplined administrative hierarchy , the power of which is absolute and little disposed to tolerate more than the bare existence of democratic methods . Would you change this ? Then must radical steps be taken , and each separate committee must be spoken to after this fashion : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We place at your disposal this or that space , such and such a sum , and if this section of the exposition is not a success you will be held responsible . " It would naturally be impossible to proceed in this way , for it would mean that the usual administrative methods would have to be suspended , and not only in regard to the conduct of the exposition , but throughout the entire country as well ; for the commissaire-g*n6ral is not only a minister of the interior who is in charge of a special deVOL . LVII. - 16. partment , but is also a minister having numerous external obligations which constitute him a sort of intermediary between the exposition and other branches of public administration . If last year it took many applications , signatures , and permits in order to have a single tree in the Bois de Boulogne cut down , it would take quite as much red tape to have a street-lamp removed , and ten times as much in order to relay a few meters of tram-rails . It may even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets of Paris which is not guarded by a squad of workmen , and which it would not be found as difficult to remove as it was for Louis XIV to send one of his subjects to the Bastille . In countries where the administrative system flourishes , and where everything is foreseen , regulated , and organized to such an extent that any change is almost equivalent to disorganization , it will easily be seen what radical changes are brought about by the creation of a new administrative service such as that of an exposition , the relations of which with regular branches of the service must naturally be intimate . The already existing bureaus have , as a rule , no easy task , for it is precisely their relations with other branches of the service which render the general executive system complex and unwieldy of movement . No single machine moves without first consulting its neighbor ; they all wait for one another , so that their movements are always interdependent , never independent . Presently is added a new machine which borrows its motive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from another a piston-rod or a crank ; hence the necessity for such a functionary as the commissaire-g*n*ral , whose supervision is at once general and detailed . Everything , in fact , from the most minute particular up to the vast ensemble must be passed upon by the commissaire-g*n*ral . When this functionary happens to be a liberal man - liberal in a philosophical , not a political sense-he lightens , in so far as possible , his official obligations . If , on the other hand , he happens to be of an administrative turn of mind , he even forces the note , and , instead of being briefer and more expeditious , he rather takes pleasure in making his hierarchy stricter , his surveillance narrower , and his cabinet more pettifogging . Little light is needed on this question in order that any one of intelligence may form an opinion regarding the relative value of these two methods . The former was employed // in conducting the Chicago Exposition , while the latter has always been followed here in France . The superiority of our method consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease and regularity with which , after so many pains , the machine fulfils its functions . But how inferior is our method in every other respect , notably in time and money ! Take , for example , the single matter of correspondence , and I think it will be found that for every letter written by the makers of the World 's Fair four or five will be written by M. Picard and his coworkers . The secretary who , for instance , just listened to your request was doubtless unable to give you an answer at once , nor are you likely to receive one for two or three days . Why are you forced to wait weeks or even months , and compelled to return five or six times ? Because , forsooth , no matter how trivial your request may be from a general point of view , it must go from bureau to bureau , it must be discussed by any number of functionaries , and be approved and signed by the coinmissaire-g6n6ral , who , at the moment of signature even , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , or who may set it aside for consideration at some future time-which may never come . You are very fortunate if your request merely concerns one of these bureaus of the exposition and does not have to be referred to any outside department , in which case it will have to pass back and forth between various officials for a much longer time , giving , meanwhile , numerous employees the excuse for writing useless letters , the mere printed headings of which indicate the intricate course your letter has been obliged to follow before arriving at its destination , and at the same time showing by what roundabout way your reply must , perforce , return to you . I spoke above of the matter of artistic unity , which , I take it , as a result of systematic centralization , manifests itself in details , ensemble effects being attained by different methods . Take , for instance , the Court of Honor at the Chicago Exposition , which formed a wonderfully beautiful whole , the defects in the general architectural harmony of which were observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only upon careful and minute examination . What , after all , are the really necessary factors in the creation of an international exposition ? Good financial backing , clever architects and engineers to draw up plans , and competent men to select and group the exhibits . Who does not see at once the disproportion between the task and the effort which we French expend in accomplishing it ? Who does not realize how we waste men and thought , time and money , in the compassing of an end which in itself is perfectly definite and simple ? In view of the great amount of time and money expended in the interest of our international expositions , it may well be asked , Of what benefit are they ? If the benefit derived from them does not compensate for the labor and expense involved , these expositions must naturally be worthless institutions . Little or no compensation is derived from the arrival in Paris of numerous foreigners who come merely for pleasure ; nor , in spite of the opinions of certain rudimentary economists , does their presence stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel- and restaurant-keepers , and the cabmen being about the only ones to profit by this feature of the exposition . Th&amp; French themselves are inspired to spend much more money than usual , and I doubt very much whether ( except in those branches of commerce I have cited above ) there is much more money in France at the close than at the opening of one of these expositions . This , however , is only one side of the question , the real point involved being whether or not these expositions benefit French industries by opening new markets , by attracting new buyers , or by emphasizing their merits in some such manner as to create increased demands for this or that product . Most thinking people now agree that their results are quite the contrary ; nor is it astonishing that such should be the case . The time has come when industrial specialties are less and less individual ; raw materials now travel from one end of the globe to the other , and it does not take long for a new invention , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into factory after factory , finally becoming the common property of the manufacturing world . The superiority of one manufacture over another arises only from certain details which obtain chiefly among manufacturers of wood , stuffs , and furniture in generalthings wherein firmness and lightness are to be supplemented by beauty , elegance , and other matters of pure taste . In this sphere the workman uses his personal gifts and other immaterial qualities , which are imitative , thus making his work belong to the domain of art . It is just such details which one can learn from one 's rivals , forming , the // while , one 's own taste on that of others . And thus we are brought face to face with the great outcry of our manufacturers against these expositions . Although at first they noted with satisfaction the increased demand for their products which followed in the wake of each exposition , our manufacturers were not long in discovering that these orders were not renewed , and also that , instead of increasing their patronage , they were only giving their rivals an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure . Thus after each exposition the barometer of French industry would rise a few degrees , only to sink lower than it had been before . In point of fact , those nations who might profitably organize expositions are new nations , or nations which , after more or less of an eclipse , are striving to rebuild their fortunes . Buenos Ayres , Melbourne , Auckland , or even Rome , Madrid , Athens , and Lisbon , should be the logical centers of such manifestations . In the larger capitals they have less raison d ' *tre , on the principle that the most prosperous and powerful peoples are naturally those further advanced in the matter of productions , and consequently are those who would profit least by being thrown in contact with other nations . The English , who , with the opening of their famous Crystal Palace , inaugurated the first exposition , have proved their lack of practical interest in such affairs by never holding another . In France , each time the subject has been discussed , and notably regarding the expositions of 1889 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections have been discussed in the Chamber and voiced by various deputies , it can not be said that the idea has ever met with any serious opposition . With her characteristic majesty , the French nation approves and encourages these expositions , and even when they can in no wise benefit her , she encourages them still more on account of the moral satisfaction which she derives from them . No historian can understand the events which took place in France during the middle of this century unless he bears in mind the one principal fact about which our destinies revolved so tragically , i. e. , that the Second Empire was only a reaction against the monarchy of Louis Philippe , and that , in acclaiming Napoleon III , the nation demanded of him only one thing , namely , foreign prestige . Parliamentary governments are little apt in procuring for the people this deceptive thing called foreign prestige , a thing which only too frequently conceals abysses of weakness and disorganization . While Louis XVIII , Charles X , and Louis Philippe enriched France by developing her resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did nothing toward bringing her the sort of prestige which she had enjoyed under Napoleon I , and which she dreamed of enjoying anew under his nephew . This thirst for prestige was clearly the raison d ' *tre of the Second Empire , and although throughout his entire reign Napoleon III strove to allay it , he never succeeded so completely as in 1867 . The exposition was an unqualified success , and was visited by all the principal sovereigns of Europe . Paris felt herself to be the veritable center of the universe , not only owing to the cosmopolitan crowd which thronged the streets , but also because the eyes of princes and peoples were turned toward the vast array of chiefs of state , chancellors , and ministers , among whom , as was well known , questions of greatest moment were being discussed . It was an object-lesson from life , and one which made an indelible impression upon France . The exposition of 1867 became a symbol of glory and power , and foreign nations as well joined in thinking that the fetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of splendor and beauty anything of the kind ever witnessed . Three years had hardly passed before the empire , overtaken by a terrible catastrophe , was swallowed up in a heap of ruins . The recovery was nevertheless rapid , and wishing at the same stroke to encourage progress as well as to give proofs of prosperity , the government of the republic decided to hold another international exposition . Following closely upon so complete and crushing a defeat , the idea seemed audacious ; but the plan was realized , and although not so successful as the preceding or the succeeding expositions , that of 1878 scored an unquestionable triumph . Its effect was strongly felt throughout France , in that it inspired not only those who labored toward the future rehabilitation of their country , but also those who were striving to build up their own shattered fortunes ; thus proving to the people themselves , as well as to Europe , that the disasters of 1870 had not wounded the nation in any vital spot . The political effect of the exposition of 1889 was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was nothing more or less than // a common schemer , had organized a vast syndicate of malcontents , to which he tried to give the aspect of a political party . At his back were those who had anything ( however small it might be ) to gain from a political revolution-persons of a type existing , of course , in every country , but who are more numerous in France , where functionaries are so plentiful , and where the sphere of governmental activity is so extended . Boulanger was also followed by an imposing array of partizans , who kept on increasing in numbers even without the hope of universal suffrage . The situation was , indeed , a critical one , for it became evident that the masses , deceived by the fallacious promises and the aspect of unity and power which this so-called National party assumed , would readily have pinned their faith to its chief , only to have discovered on the morrow of the elections that they had placed the reins of government in the hands of a band of adventurers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success beyond all expectation , in spite of the fact that the idea was at first received with coldness , if not hostility , by the various foreign powers , this internal political agitation did much toward preventing the growth of any general interest during the early stages of its development . At length , howevei* , astonished by the beautiful spectacle , and reassured by the wise and dignified attitude of President Carnot , the people were not long in regaining their senses . The electors soon decided that they thought it wiser to solidify and consolidate rather than overturn a regime which gave such gallant proofs of vitality and stability , and which had done so much toward restablishing prosperity since the somber days of 1870 . Thus , when the general elections took place , the defeat of Boulangism was complete , although certain other events , notably the proceedings instituted against the general and his subsequent flight to Brussels , contributed their share to his political downfall . However much light the fact of these proceedings and his flight threw upon the moral values of the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which placed in such strong relief the happy results achieved by the republic , the people would not have been so prompt to wheel about and turn their backs upon the Boulangist utopia . My personal recollections do not extend so far back as the exposition of 1867 . Documents contemporary with that period , however , lead us to believe that its influence was not of the best , and even that , by intoxicating the minds of certain people , it contributed in no small measure toward precipitating the war of 1870 . As has been justly said , neither the emperor nor the country at large desired war , which , however , found its warm partizans among the entourage of the emperor , as well as in the empress and among those with whom her influence was potent . It was nevertheless true that the idea easily found favor , nor was there any doubt as to the ultimate triumph of French arms  --  a beautiful assumption which was due less to the dearly bought victories in the Crimea , in Italy , and in China than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a state of mind analogous in many respects to that recently manifested in Greece . The war feeling in Greece was certainly greatly stimulated by the success which crowned the revival of the Olympic games at Athens in 1896 , an event which drew together contestants from all quarters of the globe . As a result , the Greeks fancied themselves more powerful and better prepared than they really were , and thus brought misfortune upon their country . In regard to the expositions of 1878 and 1889 , I recall very clearly the happy evolution of public spirit which followed in their wake . But who can say what will be the outcome of the exposition of 1900 ? It is always a difficult matter to predict , but the present trend of events makes me fear that its results will be not u*nlikely to recall those which followed 1867 . It is almost certain that the Emperor and Empress of Russia will visit us , and that , following in their footsteps , will come other sovereigns , escorted by numerous and brilliant suites . The effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments , as well as the fostering of an exalted belief in the power and importance of France . Belief in one 's self is good , provided it does not border upon presumption . A republic which has ceased to be a republic in all but name becomes a detestable object ; and since events have proved that a republican form of government is the only possible or stable one for France , it is therefore essential that republican ideas and customs should continue to gain a foothold in the country . The fear which I expressed above is merely a personal one and is not shared by many of my fellow-countrymen , few of whom think , with me , that complete political independence is not only useful , but indispensable to a republic surrounded , as ours is , by monarchical // states . Perhaps my fears are not justified by existing conditions , but , as will be seen here , I have at least made a careful study of the question . Another thing evident to those who pursue this subject is that these international expositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they play such an important role in our national life as to be continued time after time , even in the face of the fact that the material profits from them are often either small or nonexistent . On her side , Europe in general favors them , for she sees in them a pledge of peace , a guaranty against possible hostilities ; and thus the earlier the announcements are made , the larger the sums involved , and the more daring and grandiose are the plans , the more does European opinion favor the project . This attitude is due in a manner to the old suspicions which Europe still harbors regarding the warlike intentions of France . Our past history still inspires her with uncertainty , for she is slow to believe that we have become essentially pacific , not only from choice , but from necessity , and that for twenty years or more we have taken all the steps consistent with national dignity to banish from our domains the scourge of war . In stating awhile since that 1900 might eventually recall 1867 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible war , but rather the idea of a possible falling off in our efforts , bred of an exaggerated opinion of our progress and of a fancied superiority over our rivals . Another notable though quite different feature of our expositions is the fact that each year the question of amusements becomes a factor of more and more prominence . It is impossible for me to discover why the Americans should have been the first to adopt the word " fair , " which , asapplied to the Columbian Exposition , was assuredly a misleading term . At Chicago the amusements undoubtedly occupied very little space , being relegated , for the most part , to a long avenue called , strangely , the " Midway Plaisance , " and cleverly dubbed the " Midway Nuisance , " where near the huge wheel were found various forms of diversion , including Javanese dancers and men who swallowed swords . How sadly would their presence have marred that wonderful Court of Honor , to which white palaces , an exquisite pool , and the peristyle and colonnades fronting on Lake Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the Midway Plaisance was far removed from all this beauty was always a source of satis faction to me . On the contrary , at the Champ de Mars , in 1889 , the Parisians were delighted to find that their Cairo street , with its donkey-drivers , was near the galleries and in close touch with the more serious features of the exposition . The mere presence of such an affair has had little bearing on the real character of our international expositions for thirty years or more , and , in any case , is one which should never be tolerated in the center of the grounds , but rather in some sort of Midway Plaisance , where it would be more or less hidden from general view . Of late years these expositions have changed greatly in character , and now appeal to vastly different classes of people-to the gay as well as to the serious-minded . In Paris they have become par excellence places of amusement and diversion . Many who have never cast an eye over the various objects in the galleries come regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to go to the theater , to see dancing bayaderes or whirling dervishes , and to sip exotic drinks . It is with an eye to these folk that many people , for five or six years previous to an exposition , evolve weird plans which , in Parisian argot , are to be veritable clous , and which they hasten to submit to the commissaire-g*n*ral the morning after his nomination . One will propose to bring the moon within the range of a hundred meters by means of a gigantic telescope ; another will plan to sink wells deep enough to settle forever the question of subterranean fires ; while still another will suggest the construction of hanging gardens which will eclipse those of Semiramis . Of course one will be able to eat dinner in the telescope , to have one s ice at the bottom of the well , and to dance in the hanging gardens , for it is not so much the love of science as the love of gain which inspires these projects . The promoter naturally hopes to obtain some concession or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible out of his idea . Projects of this nature being so numerous this time , a special commission had to be appointed in order to examine and report upon them . Some were of course rejected at once , owing to their manifest absurdity , while others were retained for more detailed consideration . On further examination , many more had to be dismissed , owing to their impracticable nature , or because of some impossible feature which their inventor , in his naive enthusiasm , had not foreseen . There now re // main about a dozen , most of which , after being subjected to certain modifications , can be utilized . In the matter of amusements the masses are notoriously hard to please ; they want first-class theaters , concerts , and restaurants at reduced prices , they often want the most unheard-of things , but what they want above all is to be amused . No matter how admirable the exposition be in other points , if it is found lacking in the matter of amusements it will not be a success . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds of old who demanded perfection in their public games and circuses , and in whose mind a spectacle once seen lost all interest . They clamored for the new and the unexpected , and ultimately became bestial and sanguinary in their passionate thirst for fresh sensations . Things of this nature have happily no attraction for the crowds of to-day , who , on the contrary , are essentially gay of mood , and in whose eyes exhibitions of brutality and violence find no favor whatever . One may ask whether the effect produced by these various forms of amusement is not the reverse of moral , or whether the fairy art which creates these expositions of ours really exercises the best of influences on the majority of those who visit them . On the other hand , these expositions have furnished opportunities for manifestations of a quite different nature , notably those held in the interest of literary or scientific pursuits . Formerly only objects were exhibited , whereas now ideas are also expounded and exchanged . No exposition is now complete without its various congresses , which follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within its very confines , and in which are discussed most of the important questions which agitate the chief literary or scientific minds of the day . It is fortunate that things are so , for such circumstances do much in the way of compensating for many of the futile features I have cited above . But do these congresses really further the cause of science ; are they of any serious value ? Those who take part in them are usually busy men who have very little time at their disposal , and who possibly would prefer to spend that time in recreation rather than in study . They are , after all , men like the rest of us , and it is quite natural that they should feel the need of diversion , and , having at hand the proper opportunity , they would not be likely to let it slip . It is more than possible that their state of mind would be somewhat akin to that of school-boys in vacation-time , who do not find the ambient breezes conducive to systematic and concentrated study . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a congress of this sort is often mediocre , and that the subsequently published reports rarely bear the stamp of genius . The uninterrupted succession of congresses over a period of several weeks , as well as their marked diversity , reacts powerfully against their real value and importance . Viewed in a different light , these congresses will be found to possess one paramount merit . They give men who know one another only by reputation or through their writings the opportunity of meeting one another ; they prevent science and letters from remaining in the narrow ruts of a rigid nationalism , and , in making warm international friendships possible , they do more than anything else could ever do toward insuring the future of civilization . Just now , at the century 's turning-point , the world finds itself confronted by a difficult problem  --  a problem which calls to mind the story of Hercules being forced to choose between vice and virtue , and a problem which presents an alternative scarcely less formidable . In other words , we are either moving toward a noble internationalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization , will insure a moral and material progress such as no century has yet witnessed ; or toward a revival of nationalism , which , employing those same means , will establish a reign of perfidy and calumny , and will bring in its train a series of hideous and terrible wars . It is , alas ! impossible not to see that the world at large leans toward this latter alternative . Certain events prove conclusively that the happy hour of international good fellowship is by no means at hand .
