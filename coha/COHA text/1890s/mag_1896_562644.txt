txt SPEED in war-ships is like all comparative things to which a great deal of attention is given , and which begin to approach the limits of possibility . There is a constantly growing desire for accuracy of statement with regard to it ; a constantly diminishing area within which variations are allowed to pass without notice , and a constant increase in the number of elements which we arc compelled to take account of in calculating the area . The coniparison grows ever closer and finer as elements are struck out of it which are not common to both the things compared . But perhaps the present rage for nice excesses of speed over something which has been done before , necessarily calling in question the methods of measuring those niceties , is spurred on by special considerations . There is a distinct element of sport in it ; and without question there is money in it . Quite apart from the mouey element we have national rivalries ; naval architects ' rivalries ; engineers ' rivalries , and the rivalries of simple sportsmen who are backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special knowledge of their stables or trainers . Apart from the sport of it , there is pure business , and a living to the naval architect and the engineer . It would be strange indeed if all these elements did not continually tend to narrow the issues and refine upon them ; and if the narrowing and refining did not tend to make the ultimate fact still more difficult to determine . In yacht sailing , which is the faster of two yachts is determined directly by a race . We should know distinctly which was the faster of any two steamers under given conditions , and under common rules for tonnage , could we match them as yachts are matched . But could we // even do so , we should find difficulties arising which do not arise in sailing matches . If two steamers of nearly the same reputed speed were to be matched for a race , one against the other , it would by no means follow that the one that beat in the first match would again beat in a second or a third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speed , to make a certainty of a place in the comparison even after several matches have been run . There is the kind of coal , the skill of the stokers , hot bearings , tendency tp prime , and a hundred and one things , which are not common to both ships as wind and sea are , that may on any occasion spoil the comparison . But , if it were not so , running races to ascertain the comparative speeds of steam war-ships is not practicable , and is never carried out as it constantly was in the days of sailing ships . We are therefore thrown back on ascertaining the absolute speed of steam war-ships , and making comparison of the results in order to ascertain the relative speeds of any two of them . We say such a yacht beat such another , with very little reference indeed as to whether the average speed over the course was two knots , or ten knots ; but we say such a steamship went 19,235 knots , and such another went 19,740 knots , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is faster is another question altogether , and nothing , I suppose , strikes the naval officer in conference with the naval architect and the engineer more than their extreme indifference , as it appears , to the question of speed . Naval officers , amongst themselves , worry their souls out over the question of relative speed as deduced from comparisons of absolute speed , without always considering that speed , when they speak of it , is a relative matter which the statement that A went twenty-two knots , while B only went twenty-one , does not determine . If yacht A beats yacht B , it is not meant that yacht A took only nine minutes to pass over a certain distance while yacht B took ten minutes . Yacht A might take eleven minutes to pass over the distance that yacht B took only ten minutes to pass over , and yet yacht A might win the cup . Yacht A enjoys an allowance of time for tonnage which makes all the difference , and she might be accounted the faster , though as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we come to compare the absolute speed of // steamer A with the absolute speed of steamer B , we may possibly say that in a race steamer A would pass over a given space in a shorter time than steamer B would , but we have no right to say that she would always do it ; we must not even say that she would generally do it . Still less must we pronounce that B is by so much , a failure . Before we can say that steamer A would paas over a certain space in a shorter time than B , we must know what were the conditions of measurement which resulted in showing that A went 22 knots and B went only 21 . If we find the conditions were identical for both ships , we can still only say that A would go faster than B under those conditions . The power which drives a sailing yacht , being the wind pressing on a certain area of sail , is fixed by the force of the wind , so long as the area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamship , being dependent on the heat manufactured on board her and applied to the evaporation of water , must vary from the moment the manufacture is begun . At the beginning of the steaming , more heat may be manufactured and it may be better applied to the water , than it can possibly be later on . Stokers may become exhausted ; the difficulty of supplying coal from the bunkers may increase ; the fires may get foul ; boiler tubes may choke ; a hundred circumstances arise to make the results of a lengthy trial different from the results of a shorter one . Unless A and B are identical in all these variable speed-producing elements , it does not follow that A would beat B over a different course from that over which the speed of both was measured . A may have been found capable of steaming at the rate of 22 knots , and B at the rate of 21 knots , for half an honr ; but would either of them maintain that speed for four days ? Would either of them maintain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments have been tried . Such experiments as have been tried make it generally understood that the extreme speed at which a steamship can be driven for a very short period can never be maintained over a much longer one . Of any two steamers capable of realizing a certain speed for half an hour , the better is the one which shows least falling off during a longer trial . But the moment we begin to speak of longer and shorter trials , we are met by the point that it will certainly be easier to ensure common conditions of measurement over the shorter than // over the longer one . We can wait for a calm day , and we may use perfectly sheltered water , without swell , for the trial during a short period ; but we must go to the open ocean , and face all conditions of varying wind and sea , for a longer trial . When a steam trial is carried oat for half an hour in the United States , in Russia , France or England , in sheltered , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reported results are fairly comparable . If it was understood that all possible means were used to attain the maximum speed for this half hour only , without reference to continuing it , the comparative test would be the better . It can only be made worse , if some of the ships are tried in this way , and others are tried under conditions of steaming that could be maintained for more than half an hour . But if the ships are tried for long periods at sea , there is no guarantee that the conditions of wind and weather during the periods are alike . Indeed , it is almost certain that no two sets of conditions can be alike , or that similar wind and sea will attend any one trial from first to last . Hence , although for any individual ship long sea trial may show her doing better or worse , the long sea trial may not turn out so good a comparative trial for different ships , unless , indeed , there are so many of them that the mean results can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over afid over again crosses the Atlantic in a shorter time than another one , may certainly be pronounced the faster ship . But if it be reported that war-ship A steamed 15 knots for four days at sea , and that war-ship B only steamed 14 knots for the same period , there is a presumption in favor of A 's being the faster ship ; but many repetitions of the same trial must be made before the presumption passes irto the domain of certainty . Here we have points of contest and controversy which have been opposed to one another ever since we began to measure speed with a view to comparison , and will possibly be always opposed . The best means of measuring for comparing speed with speed in different war-ships , when we are thinking only of the first performance of the naval architect and the engineer , is seldom the best means of comparing the actual steaming powers of the two ships in sea voyages . In a general way it will no doubt follow that if one ship is found to run at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another can only be forced up to a // speed of 15 knots for the same time , then the 20-knot ship will heat the 15-knot ship in any longer or shorter run at sea , provided the water is smooth . Butt if the 20-knot ship is of a character to be much affected by sea , while the 15-knot ship is little effected by sea , then in a sea-trial against strong head wind , the 15-knot ship might beat the 20-knot ship . But it is impossible that the naval architect and engineer should cease to regard as paramount the vestilts of short trials , where comparisons can be more strictly drawn ; it is equally impossible that the naval officershould cease to make light of the accurate comparison , and to laythe highest stress on what he understands to be the seaperformance of the ships under comparison . And yet it seems equally certain that , while in this frame of mind , naval officers , and perhaps the general public , must suspend their judgment . If it were practicable to make a very large series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic , as the liners are run , each at the highest attainable speed , we might be able to take firm ground in the matter of sea performance . But such a course being utterly out of the question , we must accept the results of sea trials of war-ships as more or less tentative , and not capable of being applied as exact comparative elements . But even supposing it were otherwise ; supposing it were possible to get sea-trials of speed which extended over long periods , and were actually comparable one with another , we should have done little or nothing towards a comparison even of speeds . For just as the time allowance must be counted before any yacht can be judged a winner , so there must be a time allowance for the smaller steamships , before the larger one of greater trial speed can be accounted a better performer than the smaller one . And this , if we disregard the general question for the moment , follows directly because experiment has shown that if two similar steamships are driven at the same speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship will require less proportionate power to drive her than the smaller one . But in fact , the general question of the war ships swallows up utterly the particular question of her speed , and forces the discussion of comparative speeds on to a platform which is entirely academical , and more or less useless and misleading . The growth of speed is one of the most remarkable naval growths at // present under our notice ; it absorbs so much of our attention that we are unable to value it , or even to contemplate it , with duly balanced minds . The position to which we have elevated mere speed is indeed a preposterous one , except in the cases adverted to by me in the April number of this REVIEW . We do talk about it as if it were the be-all and end-all of the naval position of any country , and even English naval writers pronounce the doom of their country because-as alleg&amp;1 -- we had not a ship which could cross the Atlantic at the same speed as the " Columbia " did . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the designs of our ships , as the following table will exhibit at a glance . Proportion Ship 's Name . Displacement . Speed . to 1,000 tons .

The larger yacht must be handicapped because she is expected to have the greater speed as a consequence of her greater size . Here the handicapping should be all the other way . The larger the warships , the less the speed . The reason is simple enough and the result is anticipated and intended . If engine power proportioned to the displacement had been put into each of these ships we should have expected to see perhaps a continual fall in speed as the displacement grew smaller ; because a better result in speed is got out of proportionate horse-power when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is applied to the smaller , all things being similar . But the fact is that for reasons apart from speed , the larger the ship , the less is the proportionate horse-power applied to her ; or , the smaller the ship , the greater is the proportionate horse-power applied to her . This is shown in the list below . Slips ' Name Displacement H. P. Per 1,000 Tons .

In other words , it is distinctly absurd to lay any stress on the bare fact that one war-ship has a greater sea-speed than another . There is nothing whatever in the comparison . It may  --  and in fact generally does-only mean that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some other element , or elements of force than another does . It is of no value to say that A can keep up a speed of 15 knots at sea for four days , while B can only keep up a speed of 14 knots for the same time . The statement means nothing whatever that is useful , that can guide anyone , or afford praise or blame to anyone . To make the statement mean anything , it must be added that both ships had the same displacement , the same armor , the same guns , the same ammunition , the same supply of stores , provisions , coal and water , the same torpedo armament , the same manceuvering power , the same crew ; and the same cost . Then , indeed , if A steams a knot faster than B for four days , there is a failure on the part of the designer or the engineer of B. There is something in the form or design of the hull , or in the design or manufacture of the engines or boilers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if A has fewer , or smaller guns , less armor , less ammunition , less coal , water , provisions or stores ; fewer torpedoes , or a smaller crew ; who is to say that the loss on any one of these things is balanced by the knot of higher speed ? We get at once into the region of simple opinion over such a discussion and can neither stop short of it , nor advance beyond it . The proportions that the different elements of force in a war-ship ought to bear to one another , are governed principally by conjecture ; or , as I put it in a former article in this REVIEW , by fashion . But this kind of discussion over comparative speeds seems to suppose that there is a great deal more chance in the speed of a warship than really exists . As a simple and well-known fact , if the designed horse-power is realized in any war-ship , the designed speed is almost sure to be realized within a decimal . Long continued record of the performances of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed by the late lVtr . Froude , and now carried on by his Bon , almost preclude the possibility of error . There is seldom any great departure from // former designs in new ships of the same class , and if there is , the change is thoroughly tested in model before it is put into force . It follows that if the indicated horse-power of any engines produce the expected proportions of effective horse-power , and if the indicated horse-power designed is realized on the trial , the speed is sure to be realized . The fact accounts for the indifference to speed which is manifested by the naval architect and the engineer , and which , as already mentioned , surprises the naval officer . All the tests that are or can be applied to ascertain speed are , therefore , tests to ascertain whether a certain indicated horsepower can be reached and maintained . The measured mile trial being the ascertainment of the time the ship takes to run a mile , and the indicated horse-power during the run , is a test of reaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is the most accurate method of comparing speed and horsepower , and without it we never could have reached the condition now arrived at , that speed is embraced in the horse-power developed . The measured mile trial ought to show the very best that is within the capacity of the ship tried , *f it is fairly carried out . The general complaint of it , that it does not usually represent the sea-speed over a long run , is simply a mistaken one , made in forgetfulness of the fact that comparative measured mile trials properly conducted approach an accuracy of measurement which is not attaijiable in a sea-trial over a long period . Time will come when it may be possible to apply a co-efficient to the measured mile trial for ascertaining the sea speed which will be generally accepted . For the present we can but apply both systems of measnrement  --  the measured mile trial to gauge the capacity of the ship to reach a definite horse-power , and therefore a definite speed , and a sea-trial extending over a longer period in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-power and therefore speed for given periods . But in both cases , all accuracy of measurement depends on similarity , or if the word is appropriate , fairness , of the trials . It , is commonly accounted more easy to " jockey " on the short measured mile-trial than on the long sea-trial . Perhaps it is ; but on the other hand care is required that the ship he not unfairly treated . My own experience in conducting these trials showed me that , sometimes at least , the measured // mile-trial underestimated the actual capacity of the ship . There are instances whore it has been found that after the ship got to sea she developed greater indicated horse-power , and therefore greater speed , than she had shown on the measured milestrial . Comparisons between the capacities of any two ships are liable to be marred both in measured mile and in sea trials , if the conditions as to weights on board are not uniform . The calculations for indicated horse-power and speed are made for a given displacement which is that settled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These embrace all that the completed ship would go to sea with , including a certain defined proportion of coal . In the larger classes of ships in the English navy , and probably now in most others , it is not usual to make speed trials with the full amount of coal which the ship can carry on board . There are usually " reserve bunkers " which are not filled up . The justification of the practice has been well put by the late Italian naval altacltJ to the embassy in England . It would not be fair to place the ship 's steaming capacity at its worst , when it in certain that it would improve as the coal was burnt . And when the " legend " weight of the coal is on board and the amount of it can be compared with the " legend " displacement , the comparison between the steaming capacities of any two ships is not marred . But of course if one ship is tried at less than her legend displacement , another at her legend displacement , and a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but especially the third , are unduly handicapped against the first , which gets a credit on trial that she does not deserve . In the English navy , the " contractor 's trial , " which must be made before the engines are received , does not necessarily include a measured mile trial , or generally specify displacement . It is a trial carried out over periods settled in the specification , and is to determine the reaching and maintaining of the horse-power contracted for . This power is often , if not generally , exceeded when the trial is made ; but of course it is easier to reach it when the ship is light than when she is at her load draught . The real trial in the English navy is called the " commissioning trial " and is carried out with all ships which are newly commissioned , before they go finally to sea . The legend weights are all on board . It is carried on for three hours under " natural // draughts , " which , with closed stoke holds and fans , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch of water according to the nature of the boilers . The speed so certainly follows the indicated horse-power , that on this trial the ship may not be put on the measured mile at all . In fact she would not be unless there was any question about the speed . But the length of the three hours run would be measured by the best mechanical means , such as by the use of the electric log . The trial is considered satisfactory if the designed indicated horse-power is reached and maintained . But it will be found that the speed now ascertained either on the run , or on the mile , will not be thenceforth quoted against the ship . lit is much more likely that the designed speed will be associated with the name of the ship iu all the lists , doubtless because if the horse-power is realized , the speed will also have been realized . The introduction of forced draught has introduced one of those new elements to be taken note of before comparisons are made . If one ship uses half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison is vitiated ; and unless we know that both ships use the same pressure we can not make more than a rough comparison , for it is admitted that high pressure of air can not be maintained without permanent injury to the boilers . But when speed over a long period , such as three hours , is neglected in the report , and when only selected indicator diagrams are taken , to represent the power developed , it becomes evident that " jockeying " is possible even on a period trial . The whole matter rests on proper orders being given as to the conditions of trial and strict adherence to them . Any nation which accepts comparisons apparently in favor of its ships which are only arrived at by allowing the conditions to be varied , lives in a fool 's paradise as far as the speed of its war-ships is concerned . It is not likely that any nation permits such things on any scale at least . In the English navy the precautions against " jockeying ' * appear to be full ; and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I suppose is , impossible , to unite the whole staff engaged on the trials in a desire to represent things as being better than they were . Although it is not easy to say always , in the case of every foreign ship , that her reported speed trials may accurately compare with those of our own ships , yet as the designed horse-power and speed are generally quoted against the ships , divergencies are probably narrowed . // In the British navy , the trials that the public hear least of , or at any rate take least note of , are the best to go by . Every ship in commission in the navy is run for twenty-four hours once a quarter with developed horse-power equal to three-fifths of the authorized full power with natural draught . In these trials displacement is taken as it may be , and , in spite of care , weather may interfere to mar comparison . But in a three years ' commission the mean of twelve trials must be a very good measure of the steaming capacity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four she is run at the full speed of her natural draught . Probably , for comparative purposes , the mean of twelve of these runs would be the best of all available comparative tests . The tendency of these remarks is to show that it may be fallacious to devote as much attention as we now do , exclusively to the consideration of measured speed . We should , if we were wise , never consider the element of speed alone ; never lose sight of the difficulties lying in the way of accurate comparison , and never forget that excess of speed invariably means the reduction of some other element of naval force among ships of the same class . The materials for drawing comparison between methods of measuring speed employed in different countries are not yet available , but , as the designed speed is that usually quoted , the point is of less importance.
