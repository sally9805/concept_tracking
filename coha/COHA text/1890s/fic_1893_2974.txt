' cried the Idiot , grasping Mr. Pedagog by the hand " 119 Illustration : Coffee and Repartee I The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled as usual for breakfast , and in a few moments Mary , the dainty waitress , entered with the steaming coffee , the mush , and the rolls . The School-master , who , by-the-way , was suspected by Mrs. Smithers of having intentions , and who for that reason occupied the chair nearest the lady 's heart , folded up the morning paper , and placing it under him so that no one else could get it , observed , quite genially for him , " It was very wet yesterday . " " I did n't find it so , " observed a young man seated half-way down the table , who was by common consent called the Idiot , because of his " views . " " In fact , I was very dry . Curious thing , I 'm always dry on rainy days . I am one of the kind of men who know that it is the part of wisdom to stay in when it rains , or to carry an umbrella when it is not possible to stay at home , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in stalls , or stalled up in coops , as you may prefer . " " You carried an umbrella , then ? " queried the landlady , ignoring the Idiot 's shaft at the size of her " elegant and airy apartments " with an ease born of experience . " Yes , madame , " returned the Idiot , quite unconscious of what was coming . " Whose ? " queried the lady , a sarcastic smile playing about her lips . " That I can not say , Mrs. Smithers , " replied the Idiot , serenely , " but it is the one you usually carry . " " Your insinuation , sir , " said the School-master , coming to the landlady 's rescue , " is an unworthy one . The umbrella in question is mine . It has been in my possession for five years . " " Then , " replied the Idiot , unabashed , " it is time you returned it . Do n't you think men 's morals are rather lax in this matter of umbrellas , Mr. Whitechoker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who began to show signs of irritation . " Very , " said the Minister , running his finger about his neck to make the collar which had been sent home from the laundry by mistake set more easily --  " very lax . At the last Conference I attended , some person , forgetting his high office as a minister in the Church , walked off with my umbrella without so much as a thank you ; and it was embarrassing too , because the rain was coming down in bucketfuls . " " What did you do ? " asked the landlady , sympathetically . She liked Mr. Whitechoker 's sermons , and , beyond this , he was a more profitable boarder than any of the others , remaining home to luncheon every day and having to pay extra therefor . " There was but one thing left for me to do . I took the bishop 's umbrella , " said Mr. Whitechoker , blushing slightly . " But you returned it , of course ? " said the Idiot . " I intended to , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day , " replied the clergyman , visibly embarrassed by the Idiot 's unexpected cross-examination . " It 's the same way with books , " put in the Bibliomaniac , an unfortunate being whose love of rare first editions had brought him down from affluence to boarding . " Many a man who would n't steal a dollar would run off with a book . I had a friend once who had a rare copy of Through Africa by Daylight . It was a beautiful book . Only twenty-five copies printed . The margins of the pages were four inches wide , and the title-page was rubricated ; the frontispiece was colored by hand , and the seventeenth page had one of the most amusing typographical errors on it --  " " Was there any reading-matter in the book ? " queried the Idiot , blowing softly on a hot potato that was nicely balanced on the end of his fork . Illustration : " ALARMED THE COOK " " Yes , a little ; but it did n't amount to much , " returned the Bibliomaniac . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men like myself care for books . We have a higher notion than that . It is as a specimen of book-making that we admire a chaste bit of literature like Through Africa by Daylight . But , as I was saying , my friend had this book , and he 'd extra-illustrated it . He had pictures from all parts of the world in it , and the book had grown from a volume of one hundred pages to four volumes of two hundred pages each . " " And it was stolen by a highly honorable friend , I suppose ? " queried the Idiot . " Yes , it was stolen -- and my friend never knew by whom , " said the Bibliomaniac . " What ? " asked the Idiot , in much surprise . " Did you never confess ? " It was very fortunate for the Idiot that the buckwheat cakes were brought on at this moment . Had there not been some diversion of that kind , it is certain that the Bibliomaniac would have assaulted him . " It is very kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to provide us with such delightful cakes as these free of charge . " " Yes , " said the Idiot , helping himself to six cakes . " Very kind indeed , although I must say they are extremely economical from an architectural point of view -- which is to say , they are rather fuller of pores than of buckwheat . I wonder why it is , " he continued , possibly to avert the landlady 's retaliatory comments --  " I wonder why it is that porous plasters and buckwheat cakes are so similar in appearance ? " " And so widely different in their respective effects on the system , " put in a genial old gentleman who occasionally imbibed , seated next to the Idiot . " I fail to see the similarity between a buckwheat cake and a porous plaster , " said the School-master , resolved , if possible , to embarrass the Idiot . " You do n't , eh ? " replied the latter . " Then it is very plain , sir , that you have never eaten a porous plaster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he took refuge in silence . Mr. Whitechoker tried to look severe ; the gentleman who occasionally imbibed smiled all over ; the Bibliomaniac ignored the remark entirely , not having as yet forgiven the Idiot for his gross insinuation regarding his friend 's edition de luxe of Through Africa by Daylight ; Mary , the maid , who greatly admired the Idiot , not so much for his idiocy as for the aristocratic manner in which he carried himself , and the truly striking striped shirts he wore , left the room in a convulsion of laughter that so alarmed the cook below-stairs that the next platterful of cakes were more like tin plates than cakes ; and as for Mrs. Smithers , that worthy woman was speechless with wrath . But she was not paralyzed apparently , for reaching down into her pocket she brought forth a small piece of paper , on which was written in detail the " account due " of the Idiot . " I 'd like to have this settled , sir , " she said , with some asperity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unabashed --  " certainly . Can you change a check for a hundred ? " No , Mrs. Smithers could not . " Then I shall have to put off paying the account until this evening , " said the Idiot . " But , " he added , with a glance at the amount of the bill , " are you related to Governor McKinley , Mrs. Smithers ? " " I am not , " she returned , sharply . " My mother was a Partington . " " I only asked , " said the Idiot , apologetically , " because I am very much interested in the subject of heredity , and you may not know it , but you and he have each a marked tendency towards high-tariff bills . " And before Mrs. Smithers could think of anything to say , the Idiot was on his way down town to help his employer lose money on Wall Street . II " Do you know , I sometimes think --  " began the Idiot , opening and shutting the silver cover of his watch several times with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laudable , purpose of calling his landlady 's attention to the fact -- of which she was already painfully aware -- that breakfast was fifteen minutes late . " Do you , really ? " interrupted the School-master , looking up from his book with an air of mock surprise . " I am sure I never should have suspected it . " " Indeed ? " returned the Idiot , undisturbed by this reflection upon his intellect . " I do n't really know whether that is due to your generally unsuspicious nature , or to your shortcomings as a mind-reader . " " There are some minds , " put in the landlady at this point , " that are so small that it would certainly ruin the eyes to read them . " " I have seen many such , " observed the Idiot , suavely . " Even our friend the Bibliomaniac at times has seemed to me to be very absent-minded . And that reminds me , Doctor , " he continued , addressing himself to the medical boarder . " What is the cause of absent-mindedness ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very large question . Absent-mindedness , generally speaking , is the result of the projection of the intellect into surroundings other than those which for want of a better term I might call the corporeally immediate . " " So I have understood , " said the Idiot , approvingly . " And is absent-mindedness acquired or inherent ? " Here the Idiot appropriated the roll of his neighbor . " That depends largely upon the case , " replied the Doctor , nervously . " Some are born absent-minded , some achieve absent-mindedness , and some have absent-mindedness thrust upon them . " " As illustrations of which we might take , for instance , I suppose , " said the Idiot , " the born idiot , the borrower , and the man who is knocked silly by the pole of a truck on Broadway . " " Precisely , " replied the Doctor , glad to get out of the discussion so easily . He was a very young doctor , and not always sure of himself . " Or , " put in the School-master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would kindly go out upon Broadway and encounter the truck , we should find the three combined in him . " The landlady here laughed quite heartily , and handed the School-master an extra strong cup of coffee . " There is a great deal in what you say , " said the Idiot , without a tremor . " There are very few scientific phenomena that can not be demonstrated in one way or another by my poor self . It is the exception always that proves the rule , and in my case you find a consistent converse exemplification of all three branches of absent-mindedness . " " He talks well , " said the Bibliomaniac , sotto voce , to the Minister . " Yes , especially when he gets hold of large words . I really believe he reads , " replied Mr. Whitechoker . Illustration : " ' WHAT ARE THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF INSANITY ? ' " " I know he does , " said the School-master , who had overheard . " I saw him reading Webster 's Dictionary last night . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to words that come between the letters A and F , which shows that as yet he has not dipped very deeply into the book . " " What are you murmuring about ? " queried the Idiot , noting the lowered tone of those on the other side of the table . " We were conversing -- ahem ! about --  " began the Minister , with a despairing glance at the Bibliomaniac . " Let me say it , " interrupted the Bibliomaniac . " You are n't used to prevarication , and that is what is demanded at this time . We were talking about -- ah -- about -- er --  " " Tut ! tut ! " ejaculated the School-master . " We were only saying we thought the -- er -- the -- that the --  " " What are the first symptoms of insanity , Doctor ? " observed the Idiot , with a look of wonder at the three shuffling boarders opposite him , and turning anxiously to the physician . " I wish you would n't talk shop , " retorted the Doctor , angrily . Insanity was one of his weak points . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this turn of the conversation . " Well , perhaps you are right , " returned the Idiot . " People do , as a rule , prefer to talk of things they know something about , and I do n't blame you , Doctor , for wanting to keep out of a medical discussion . I only asked my last question because the behavior of the Bibliomaniac and Mr. Whitechoker and the School-master for some time past has worried me , and I did n't know but what you might work up a nice little practice among us . It might not pay , but you 'd find the experience valuable , and I think unique . " " It is a fine thing to have a doctor right in the house , " said Mr. Whitechoker , kindly , fearing that the Doctor 's manifest indignation might get the better of him . " That , " returned the Idiot , " is an assertion , Mr. Whitechoker , that is both true and untrue . There are times when a physician is an ornament to a boarding-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Wednesday morning if it had not been for the surgical skill of our friend here , our good landlady could never have managed properly to distribute the late autumn chicken we found upon the menu . Tally one for the affirmative . On the other hand , I must confess to considerable loss of appetite when I see the Doctor rolling his bread up into little pills , or measuring the vinegar he puts on his salad by means of a glass dropper , and taking the temperature of his coffee with his pocket thermometer . Nor do I like -- and I should not have mentioned it save by way of illustrating my position in regard to Mr. Whitechoker 's assertion -- nor do I like the cold , eager glitter in the Doctor 's eyes as he watches me consuming , with some difficulty , I admit , the cold pastry we have served up to us on Saturday mornings under the wholly transparent alias of ' Hot Bread . ' I may have very bad taste , but , in my humble opinion , the man who talks shop is preferable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some more iced potatoes , Mary , " he added , calmly . Illustration : " ' READING WEBSTER 'S DICTIONARY ' " " Madame , " said the Doctor , turning angrily to the landlady , " this is insufferable . You may make out my bill this morning . I shall have to seek a home elsewhere . " " Oh , now , Doctor ! " began the landlady , in her most pleading tone . " Jove ! " ejaculated the Idiot . " That 's a good idea , Doctor . I think I 'll go with you ; I 'm not altogether satisfied here myself , but to desert so charming a company as we have here had never occurred to me . Together , however , we can go forth , and perhaps find happiness . Shall we put on our hunting togs and chase the fiery , untamed hall-room to the death this morning , or shall we put it off until some pleasanter day ? " " Put it off , " observed the School-master , persuasively . " The Idiot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you have known him longer you will understand him better . Views are as necessary to him as sunlight to the flowers ; and I truly think that in an asylum he would prove a delightful companion . " " There , Doctor , " said the Idiot ; " that 's handsome of the School-master . He could n't make more of an apology if he tried . I 'll forgive him if you will . What say you ? " And strange to say , the Doctor , in spite of the indignation which still left a red tinge on his cheek , laughed aloud and was reconciled . As for the School-master , he wanted to be angry , but he did not feel that he could afford his wrath , and for the first time in some months the guests went their several ways at peace with each other and the world . III There was a conspiracy in hand to embarrass the Idiot . The School-master and the Bibliomaniac had combined forces to give him a taste of his own medicine . The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantage ; and the two boarders , the one proud of his learning , and the other not wholly unconscious of a bookish life , were distinctly tired of the triumphant manner in which the Idiot always left the breakfast-table to their invariable discomfiture . It was the School-master 's suggestion to put their tormentor into the pit he had heretofore digged for them . The worthy instructor of youth had of late come to see that while he was still a prime favorite with his landlady , he had , nevertheless , suffered somewhat in her estimation because of the apparent ease with which the Idiot had got the better of him on all points . It was necessary , he thought , to rehabilitate himself , and a deep-laid plot , to which the Bibliomaniac readily lent ear , was the result of his reflections . They twain were to indulge in a discussion of the great story of Robert Elsmere , which both were confident the Idiot had not read , and concerning which they felt assured he could not have an intelligent opinion if he had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as the boarders sat them down to partake of the usual " restful breakfast , " as the Idiot termed it , the Bibliomaniac observed : " I have just finished reading Robert Elsmere . " " Have you , indeed ? " returned the School-master , with apparent interest . " I trust you profited by it ? " " On the contrary , " observed the Bibliomaniac . " My views are much unsettled by it . " " I prefer the breast of the chicken , Mrs. Smithers , " observed the Idiot , sending his plate back to the presiding genius of the table . " The neck of a chicken is graceful , but not too full of sustenance . " " He fights shy , " whispered the Bibliomaniac , gleefully . " Never mind , " returned the School-master , confidently ; " we 'll land him yet . " Then he added , aloud : " Unsettled by it ? I fail to see how any man with beliefs that are at all the result of mature convictions can be unsettled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have always said --  " " I never could understand why the neck of a chicken should be allowed on a respectable table anyhow , " continued the Idiot , ignoring the controversy in which his neighbors were engaged , " unless for the purpose of showing that the deceased fowl met with an accidental rather than a natural death . " " In what way does the neck demonstrate that point ? " queried the Bibliomaniac , forgetting the conspiracy for a moment . " By its twist or by its length , of course , " returned the Idiot . " A chicken that dies a natural death does not have its neck wrung ; nor when the head is removed by the use of a hatchet , is it likely that it will be cut off so close behind the ears that those who eat the chicken are confronted with four inches of neck . " Illustration : " ' I STUCK TO THE PIGS ' " " Very entertaining indeed , " interposed the School-master ; " but we are wandering from the point the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of Robert Elsmere unsettling to one 's beliefs ? Perhaps you can help us to decide that question . " " Perhaps I can , " returned the Idiot ; " and perhaps not . It did not unsettle my beliefs . " " But do n't you think , " observed the Bibliomaniac , " that to certain minds the book is more or less unsettling ? " " To that I can confidently say no . The certain mind knows no uncertainty , " replied the Idiot , calmly . " Very pretty indeed , " said the School-master , coldly . " But what was your opinion of Mrs. Ward 's handling of the subject ? Do you think she was sufficiently realistic ? And if so , and Elsmere weakened under the stress of circumstances , do you think -- or do n't you think -- the production of such a book harmful , because -- being real -- it must of necessity be unsettling to some minds ? " Illustration : THE CONSPIRATORS " I prefer not to express an opinion on that subject , " returned the Idiot , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ejaculated the School-master , a look of triumph in his eyes . " Why , everybody has read Elsmere that pretends to have read anything , " asserted the Bibliomaniac . " Of course , " put in the landlady , with a scornful laugh . " Well , I did n't , " said the Idiot , nonchalantly . " The same ground was gone over two years before in Burrows 's great story , Is It , or Is It Not ? and anybody who ever read Clink 's books on the Non-Existent as Opposed to What Is , knows where Burrows got his points . Burrows 's story was a perfect marvel . I do n't know how many editions it went through in England , and when it was translated into French by Madame Tournay , it simply set the French wild . " " Great Scott ! " whispered the Bibliomaniac , desperately , " I 'm afraid we 've been barking up the wrong tree . " " You 've read Clink , I suppose ? " asked the Idiot , turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blushing deeply . The Idiot looked surprised , and tried to conceal a smile by sipping his coffee from a spoon . " And Burrows ? " " No , " returned the School-master , humbly . " I never read Burrows . " " Well , you ought to . It 's a great book , and it 's the one Robert Elsmere is taken from -- same ideas all through , I 'm told -- that 's why I did n't read Elsmere . Waste of time , you know . But you noticed yourself , I suppose , that Clink 's ground is the same as that covered in Elsmere ? " " No ; I only dipped lightly into Clink , " returned the School-master , with some embarrassment . " But you could n't help noticing a similarity of ideas ? " insisted the Idiot , calmly . The School-master looked beseechingly at the Bibliomaniac , who would have been glad to fly to his co-conspirator 's assistance had he known how , but never having heard of Clink , or Burrows either , for that matter , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation for him to stay out of the controversy . " Very slight similarity , however , " said the School-master , in despair . " Where can I find Clink 's books ? " put in Mr. Whitechoker , very much interested . The Idiot conveniently had his mouth full of chicken at the moment , and it was to the School-master who had also read him that they all -- the landlady included -- looked for an answer . " Oh , I think , " returned that worthy , hesitatingly --  " I think you 'll find Clink in any of the public libraries . " " What is his full name ? " persisted Mr. Whitechoker , taking out a memorandum-book . " Horace J. Clink , " said the Idiot . " Yes ; that 's it -- Horace J. Clink , " echoed the School-master . " Very virile writer and a clear thinker , " he added , with some nervousness . " What , if any , of his books would you specially recommend ? " asked the Minister again . The Idiot had by this time risen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman who occasionally imbibed . The School-master 's reply was not audible . " I say , " said the genial gentleman to the Idiot , as they passed out into the hall , " they did n't get much the best of you in that matter . But , tell me , who was Clink , anyhow ? " " Never heard of him before , " returned the Idiot . " And Burrows ? " " Same as Clink . " " Know anything about Elsmere ? " chuckled the genial gentleman . " Nothing -- except that it and ' Pigs in Clover ' came out at the same time , and I stuck to the Pigs . " And the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed was so pleased at the plight of the School-master and of the Bibliomaniac that he invited the Idiot up to his room , where the private stock was kept for just such occasions , and they put in a very pleasant morning together . IV The guests were assembled as usual . The oatmeal course had been eaten in silence . In the Idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boded ill for the man who should challenge him to controversial combat -- and there seemed also to be , judging from sundry winks passed over the table and kicks passed under it , an understanding to which he and the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed were parties . As the School-master sampled his coffee the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed broke the silence . " I missed you at the concert last night , Mr. Idiot , " said he . " Yes , " said the Idiot , with a caressing movement of the hand over his upper lip ; " I was very sorry , but I could n't get around last night . I had an engagement with a number of friends at the athletic club . I meant to have dropped you a line in the afternoon telling you about it , but I forgot it until it was too late . Was the concert a success ? " " Very successful indeed . The best one , in fact , we have had this season , which makes me regret all the more deeply your absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a smile playing about his lips . " Indeed , " he added , " it was the finest one I 've ever seen . " " The finest one you 've what ? " queried the School-master , startled at the verb . " The finest one I 've ever seen , " replied the genial gentleman . " There were only ten performers , and really , in all my experience as an attendant at concerts , I never saw such a magnificent rendering of Beethoven as we had last night . I wish you could have been there . It was a sight for the gods . " " I do n't believe , " said the Idiot , with a slight cough that may have been intended to conceal a laugh -- and that may also have been the result of too many cigarettes --  " I do n't believe it could have been any more interesting than a game of pool I heard at the club . " " It appears to me , " said the Bibliomaniac to the School-master , " that the popping sounds we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some connection with the present mode of speech these two gentlemen affect . " " Let 's hear them out , " returned the School-master , " and then we 'll take them into camp , as the Idiot would say . " " I do n't know about that , " replied the genial gentleman . " I 've seen a great many concerts , and I 've heard a great many good games of pool , but the concert last night was simply a ravishing spectacle . We had a Cuban pianist there who played the orchestration of the first act of Parsifal with surprising agility . As far as I could see , he did n't miss a note , though it was a little annoying to observe how he used the pedals . " " Too forcibly , or how ? " queried the Idiot . " Not forcibly enough , " returned the Imbiber . " He tried to work them both with one foot . It was the only thing to mar an otherwise marvellous performance . The idea of a man trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a musician with a trained eye . " Illustration : " ' WERE N'T YOUR EARS LONG ENOUGH ? ' " " I wish the Doctor would come down , " said Mrs. Smithers , anxiously . " Yes , " put in the School-master ; " there seems to be madness in our midst . " " Well , what can you expect of a Cuban , anyhow ? " queried the Idiot . " The Cuban , like the Spaniard or the Italian or the African , has n't the vigor which is necessary for the proper comprehension and rendering of Wagner 's music . He is by nature slow and indolent . If it were easier for a Spaniard to hop than to walk , he 'd hop , and rest his other leg . I 've known Italians whose diet was entirely confined to liquids , because they were too tired to masticate solids . It is the ease with which it can be absorbed that makes macaroni the favorite dish of the Italians , and the fondness of all Latin races for wines is entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be swallowed without chewing . This indolence affects also their language . The Italian and the Spaniard speak the language that comes easy -- that is soft and dreamy ; while the Germans and Russians , stronger , more energetic , indulge in a speech that even to us , who are people of an average amount of energy , is sometimes appalling in the severity of the strain it puts upon the tongue . So , while I do not wonder that your Cuban pianist showed woful defects in his use of the pedals , I do wonder that , even with his surprising agility , he had sufficient energy to manipulate the keys to the satisfaction of so competent a witness as yourself . " " It was too bad ; but we made up for it later , " asserted the other . " There was a young girl there who gave us some of Mendelssohn 's Songs without Words . Her expression was simply perfect . I would n't have missed it for all the world ; and now that I think of it , in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . We persuaded her to encore the songs in the dark , and we got a flash-light photograph of two of them . " " Oh ! then it was not on the piano-forte she gave them ? " said the Idiot . " Oh no ; all labial , " returned the genial gentleman . Here Mr. Whitechoker began to look concerned , and whispered something to the School-master , who replied that there were enough others present to cope with the two parties to the conversation in case of a violent outbreak . " I 'd be very glad to see the photographs , " replied the Idiot . " Ca n't I secure copies of them for my collection ? You know I have the complete rendering of ' Home , Sweet Home ' in kodak views , as sung by Patti . They are simply wonderful , and they prove what has repeatedly been said by critics , that , in the matter of expression , the superior of Patti has never been seen . " " I 'll try to get them for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist is a very shy young girl , and does not care to have her efforts given too great a publicity until she is ready to go into music a little more deeply . She is going to read the ' Moonlight Sonata ' to us at our next concert . You 'd better come . I 'm told her gestures bring out the composer 's meaning in a manner never as yet equalled . " Illustration : " ' THE CORKS POPPED TO SOME PURPOSE LAST NIGHT ' " " I 'll be there ; thank you , " returned the Idiot . " And the next time those fellows at the club are down for a pool tournament I want you to come up and hear them play . It was extraordinary last night to hear the balls dropping one by one -- click , click , click -- as regularly as a metronome , into the pockets . One of the finest shots , I am sorry to say , I missed . " " How did it happen ? " asked the Bibliomaniac . " Were n't your ears long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't hear it , " returned the Idiot . " I think you men are crazy , " said the School-master , unable to contain himself any longer . " So ? " observed the Idiot , calmly . " And how do we show our insanity ? " " Seeing concerts and hearing games of pool . " " I take exception to your ruling , " returned the Imbiber . " As my friend the Idiot has frequently remarked , you have the peculiarity of a great many men in your profession , who think because they never happened to see or do or hear things as other people do , they may not be seen , done , or heard at all . I saw the concert I attended last night . Our musical club has rooms next to a hospital , and we have to give silent concerts for fear of disturbing the patients ; but we are all musicians of sufficient education to understand by a glance of the eye what you would fail to comprehend with fourteen ears and a microphone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a scornful glance at the School-master . " And I literally heard the pool tournament . I was dining in a room off the billiard-hall , and every shot that was made , with the exception of the one I spoke of , was distinctly audible . You gentlemen , who think you know it all , would n't be able to supply a bureau of information at the rate of five minutes a day for an hour on a holiday . Let 's go up-stairs , " he added , turning to the Imbiber , " where we may discuss our last night 's entertainment apart from this atmosphere of rarefied learning . It makes me faint . " And the Imbiber , who was with difficulty keeping his lips in proper form , was glad enough to accept the invitation . " The corks popped to some purpose last night , " he said , later on . " Yes , " said the Idiot ; " for a conspiracy there 's nothing so helpful as popping corks . " V " When you get through with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one winter 's morning , noticing that the ample proportions of the School-master served as a screen to shut off the heat from himself and the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed , " I wish you would let us have a little of it . Indeed , if you could conveniently spare so little as one flame for my friend here and myself , we 'd be much obliged . " " It wo n't hurt you to cool off a little , sir , " returned the School-master , without moving . " No , I am not so much afraid of the injury that may be mine as I am concerned for you . If that fire should melt our only refrigerating material , I do not know what our good landlady would do . Is it true , as the Bibliomaniac asserts , that Mrs. Smithers leaves all her milk and butter in your room overnight , relying upon your coolness to keep them fresh ? " " I never made any such assertion , " said the Bibliomaniac , warmly . " I am not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a wink at the genial old gentleman . " But I never said it , and I defy you to prove that I said it , " returned the Bibliomaniac , hotly . " You forget , sir , " said the Idiot , coolly , " that you are the one who disputes my assertion . That casts the burden of proof on your shoulders . Of course if you can prove that you never said anything of the sort , I withdraw ; but if you can not adduce proofs , you , having doubted my word , and publicly at that , need not feel hurt if I decline to accept all that you say as gospel . " " You show ridiculous heat , " said the School-master . " Thank you , " returned the Idiot , gracefully . " And that brings us back to the original proposition that you would do well to show a little yourself . " " Good-morning , gentlemen , " said Mrs. Smithers , entering the room at this moment . " It 's a bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the School-master , gallantly . " Yes , " added the Idiot , with a glance at the clock , which registered 8.45 -- forty-five minutes after the breakfast hour --  " very like Mrs. Smithers -- rather advanced . " To this the landlady paid no attention ; but the School-master could not refrain from saying , " Advanced , and therefore not backward , like some persons I might name . " " Very clever , " retorted the Idiot , " and really worth rewarding . Mrs. Smithers , you ought to give Mr. Pedagog a receipt in full for the past six months . " " Mr. Pedagog , " returned the landlady , severely , " is one of the gentlemen who always have their receipts for the past six months . " " Which betrays a very saving disposition , " accorded the Idiot . " I wish I had all I 'd received for six months . I 'd be a rich man . " Illustration : " ' IF YOU COULD SPARE SO LITTLE AS ONE FLAME ' " " Would you , now ? " queried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ideas differ on the subject of wealth ! Here is the Idiot would consider himself rich with $150 in his pocket --  " " Do you think he gets as much as that ? " put in the School-master , viciously . " Five dollars a week is rather high pay for one of his --  " " Very high indeed , " agreed the Idiot . " I wish I got that much . I might be able to hire a two-legged encyclopaedia to tell me everything , and have over $4.75 a week left to spend on opera , dress , and the poor but honest board Mrs. Smithers provides , if my salary was up to the $5 mark ; but the trouble is men do not make the fabulous fortunes nowadays with the ease with which you , Mr. Pedagog , made yours . There are , no doubt , more and greater opportunities to-day than there were in the olden time , but there are also more men trying to take advantage of them . Labor in the business world is badly watered . The colleges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country turned out in a year forty years ago , and the quality is so poor that there has been a general reduction of wages all along the line . Where does the struggler for existence come in when he has to compete with the college-bred youth who , for fear of not getting employment anywhere , is willing to work for nothing ? People are not willing to pay for what they can get for nothing . " " I am glad to hear from your lips so complete an admission , " said the School-master , " that education is downing ignorance . " " I am glad to know of your gladness , " returned the Idiot . " I did n't quite say that education was downing ignorance . I plead guilty to the charge of holding the belief that unskilled omniscience interferes very materially with skilled sciolism in skilled sciolism 's efforts to make a living . " " Then you admit your own superficiality ? " asked the School-master , somewhat surprised by the Idiot 's command of syllables . " I admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idiot . " I prefer to go through life feeling that there is yet something for me to learn . It seems to me far better to admit this voluntarily than to have it forced home upon me by circumstances , as happened in the case of a college graduate I know , who speculated on Wall Street , and lost the hundred dollars that were subsequently put to a good use by the uneducated me . " " From which you deduce that ignorance is better than education ? " queried the School-master , scornfully . " For an omniscient , " returned the Idiot , " you are singularly near-sighted . I have made no such deduction . I arrive at the conclusion , however , that in the chase for the gilded shekel the education of experience is better than the coddling of Alma Mater . In the satisfaction -- the personal satisfaction -- one derives from a liberal education , I admit that the sons of Alma Mater are the better off . I never could hope to be so self-satisfied , for instance , as you are . " Illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed the School-master , " you can not raise grapes on a thistle farm . Any unbiassed observer looking around this table , " he added , " and noting Mr. Whitechoker , a graduate of Yale ; the Bibliomaniac , a son of dear old Harvard ; the Doctor , an honor man of Williams ; our legal friend here , a graduate of Columbia -- to say nothing of myself , who was graduated with honors at Amherst -- any unbiassed observer seeing these , I say , and then seeing you , would n't take very long to make up his mind as to whether a man is better off or not for having had a collegiate training . " " There I must again dispute your assertion , " returned the Idiot . " The unbiassed person of whom you speak would say , ' Here is this gray-haired Amherst man , this book-loving Cambridge boy of fifty-seven years of age , the reverend graduate of Yale , class of ' 55 , and the other two learned gentlemen of forty-nine summers each , and this poor ignoramus of an Idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same box . ' And then he would ask himself , ' In what way have these sons of Amherst , Yale , Harvard , and so forth , the better of the unassuming Idiot ? ' " " The same box ? " said the Bibliomaniac . " What do you mean by that ? " " Just what I say , " returned the Idiot . " The same box . All boarding , all eschewing luxuries of necessity , all paying their bills with difficulty , all sparsely clothed ; in reality , all keeping Lent the year through . ' Verily , ' he would say , ' the Idiot has the best of it , for he is young . ' " And leaving them chewing the cud of reflection , the Idiot departed . " I thought they were going to land you that time , " said the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed , later ; " but when I heard you use the word ' sciolism , ' I knew you were all right . Where did you get it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office the other day . I happened in a mad moment to try to unload some of my original observations on him apropos of my getting to the office two hours late , in which it was my endeavor to prove to him that the truly safe and conservative man was always slow , and so apt to turn up late on occasions . He hopped about the office for a minute or two , and then he informed me that I was an 18-karat sciolist . I did n't know what he meant , and so I looked it up . " " And what did he mean ? " " He meant that I took the cake for superficiality , and I guess he was right , " replied the Idiot , with a smile that was not altogether mirthful . VI " Good-morning ! " said the Idiot , cheerfully , as he entered the dining-room . To this remark no one but the landlady vouchsafed a reply . " I do n't think it is , " she said , shortly . " It 's raining too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That reminds me , " observed the Idiot , taking his seat and helping himself copiously to the hominy . " A friend of mine on one of the newspapers is preparing an article on the ' Antiquity of Modern Humor . ' With your kind permission , Mrs. Smithers , I 'll take down your remark and hand it over to Mr. Scribuler as a specimen of the modern antique joke . You may not be aware of the fact , but that jest is to be found in the rare first edition of the Tales of Bobbo , an Italian humorist , who stole everything he wrote from the Greeks . " Illustration : " ' READING THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS ' " " So ? " queried the Bibliomaniac . " I never heard of Bobbo , though I had , before the auction sale of my library , a choice copy of the Tales of Poggio , bound in full crushed Levant morocco , with gilt edges , and one or two other Italian Joe Millers in tree calf . I can not at this moment recall their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " inquired the School-master . " I do n't exactly remember , " returned the Idiot , assisting the last potato on the table over to his plate . " I do n't know exactly . It was subsequent to B.C. , I think , although I may be wrong . If it was not , you may rest assured it was prior to B.C. " " Do you happen to know , " queried the Bibliomaniac , " the exact date of this rare first edition of which you speak ? " " No ; no one knows that , " returned the Idiot . " And for a very good reason . It was printed before dates were invented . " The silence which followed this bit of information from the Idiot was almost insulting in its intensity . It was a silence that spoke , and what it said was that the Idiot 's idiocy was colossal , and he , accepting the stillness as a tribute , smiled sweetly . " What do you think , Mr. Whitechoker , " he said , when he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think of the doctrine that every day will be Sunday by-and-by ? " " I have only to say , sir , " returned the Dominie , pouring a little hot water into his milk , which was a bit too strong for him , " that I am a firm believer in the occurrence of a period when Sunday will be to all practical purposes perpetual . " " That is my belief , too , " observed the School-master . " But it will be ruinous to our good landlady to provide us with one of her exceptionally fine Sunday breakfasts every morning . " " Thank you , Mr. Pedagog , " returned Mrs. Smithers , with a smile . " Ca n't I give you another cup of coffee ? " " You may , " returned the School-master , pained at the lady 's grammar , but too courteous to call attention to it save by the emphasis with which he spoke the word " may . " " That 's one view to take of it , " said the Idiot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the week , we , on the other hand , would get approximately what we pay for . You may fill my cup too , Mrs. Smithers . " " The coffee is all gone , " returned the landlady , with a snap . " Then , Mary , " said the Idiot , gracefully , turning to the maid , " you may give me a glass of ice-water . It is quite as warm , after all , as the coffee , and not quite so weak . A perpetual Sunday , though , would have its drawbacks , " he added , unconscious of the venomous glances of the landlady . " You , Mr. Whitechoker , for instance , would be preaching all the time , and in consequence would soon break down . Then the effect upon our eyes from habitually reading the Sunday newspapers day after day would be extremely bad ; nor must we forget that an eternity of Sundays means the elimination ' from our midst , ' as the novelists say , of baseball , of circuses , of horse-racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to cast over the Puritanical view of Sunday which now prevails . It would substitute Dr. Watts for ' Annie Rooney . ' We should lose ' Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay ' entirely , which is a point in its favor . " " I do n't know about that , " said the genial old gentleman . " I rather like that song . " " Did you ever hear me sing it ? " asked the Idiot . " Never mind , " returned the genial old gentleman , hastily . " Perhaps you are right , after all . " Illustration : BOBBO The Idiot smiled , and resumed : " Our shops would be perpetually closed , and an enormous loss to the shopkeepers would be sure to follow . Mr. Pedagog 's theory that we should have Sunday breakfasts every day is not tenable , for the reason that with a perpetual day of rest agriculture would die out , food products would be killed off by unpulled weeds ; in fact , we should go back to that really unfortunate period when women were without dress-makers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals as he met them , and to abstain from apples , wisdom , and full dress . " " The Idiot is right , " said the Bibliomaniac . " It would not be a very good thing for the world if every day were Sunday . Wash-day is a necessity of life . I am willing to admit this , in the face of the fact that wash-day meals are invariably atrocious . Contracts would be void , as a rule , because Sunday is a dies non . " " A what ? " asked the Idiot . " A non-existent day in a business sense , " put in the School-master . " Of course , " said the landlady , scornfully . " Any person who knows anything knows that . " " Then , madame , " returned the Idiot , rising from his chair , and putting a handful of sweet crackers in his pocket --  " then I must put in a claim for $104 from you , having been charged , at the rate of one dollar a day for 104 dies nons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Indeed ! " returned the lady , sharply . " Very well . And I shall put in a counterclaim for the lunches you carry away from breakfast every morning in your pockets . " " In that event we 'll call it off , madame , " returned the Idiot , as with a courtly bow and a pleasant smile he left the room . " Well , I call him ' off , ' " was all the landlady could say , as the other guests took their departure . And of course the School-master agreed with her . VII " Our streets appear to be as far from perfect as ever , " said the Bibliomaniac with a sigh , as he looked out through the window at the great pools of water that gathered in the basins made by the sinking of the Belgian blocks . " We 'd better go back to the cowpaths of our fathers . " " There is a great deal in what you say , " observed the School-master . " The cowpath has all the solidity of mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pavements that obtain to-day . It is porous and absorbs the moisture . The Belgian pavement is leaky , and lets it run into our cellars . We might do far worse than to go back --  " " Excuse me for having an opinion , " said the Idiot , " but the man of enterprise ca n't afford to indulge in the luxury of the somnolent cowpath . It is too quiet . It conduces to sleep , which is a luxury business men can not afford to indulge in too freely . Man must be up and doing . The prosperity of a great city is to my mind directly due to its noise and clatter , which effectually put a stop to napping , and keep men at all times wide awake . " " This is a Welsh-rabbit idea , I fancy , " said the School-master , quietly . He had overheard the Idiot 's confidences , as revealed to the genial Imbiber , regarding the sources of some of his ideas . " Not at all , " returned the Idiot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of much thought . If you will put your mind on the subject , you will see for yourself that there is more in my theory than there is in yours . The prosperity of a locality is the greater as the noise in its vicinity increases . It is in the quiet neighborhood that man stagnates . Where do we find great business houses ? Where do we find great fortunes made ? Where do we find the busy bees who make the honey that enables posterity to get into Society and do nothing ? Do we pick up our millions on the cowpath ? I guess not . Do we erect our most princely business houses along the roads laid out by our bovine sister ? I think not . Does the man who goes from the towpath to the White House take the short cut ? I fancy not . He goes over the block pavement . He seeks the home of the noisy , clattering street before he lands in the shoes of Washington . The man who sticks to the cowpath may be able to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that you say is very true , but it is not based on any fundamental principle . It is so because it happens to be so , " returned the School-master . " If it were man 's habit to have the streets laid out on the old cowpath principle in his cities he would be quite as energetic , quite as prosperous , as he is now . " " No fundamental principle involved ? There is the fundamental principle of all business success involved , " said the Idiot , warming up to his subject . " What is the basic quality in the good business man ? Alertness . What is ' alertness ? ' Wide-awakeishness . In this town it is impossible for a man to sleep after a stated hour , and for no other reason than that the clatter of the pavements prevents him . As a promoter of alertness , where is your cowpath ? The cowpaths of the Catskills , and we all know the mountains are riddled by ' em , did n't keep Rip Van Winkle awake , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is n't a man in his congregation who can sleep a half-hour -- much less twenty years -- with Broadway within hearing distance . " I tell you , Mr. Pedagog , " he continued , " it is the man from the cowpath who gets buncoed . It 's the man from the cowpath who ca n't make a living even out of what he calls his ' New York Store . ' It is the man from the cowpath who rejoices because he can sell ten dollars ' worth of sheep's-wool for five dollars , and is happy when he goes to meeting dressed up in a four-dollar suit of clothes that has cost him twenty . " " Your theory , my young friend , " observed the School-master , " is as fragile as this cup "  - -  tapping his coffee-cup . " The countryman of whom you speak is up and doing long before you or I or your successful merchant , who has waxed great on noise as you put it , is awake . If the early bird catches the worm , what becomes of your theory ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied the Idiot . " But he does not catch the fish , and I 'll offer the board another wager that the Belgian block merchant is wider awake at 8 A.M. , when he first opens his eyes , than his suburban brother who gets up at five is all day . It 's the extent to which the eyes are opened that counts , and as for your statement that the fact that prosperity and noisy streets go hand in hand is true only because it happens to be so , that is an argument which may be applied to any truth in existence . I am because I happen to be , not because I am . You are what you are because you are , because if you were not , you would not be what you are . " " Your logic is delightful , " said the School-master , scornfully . " I strive to please , " replied the Idiot . " But I do agree with the Bibliomaniac that our streets are far from perfection , " he added . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground-floor should be the sewers and telegraph pipes ; above this should be the water-mains , then a layer for trucks , then a broad stratum for carriages , above which should be a promenade for pedestrians . The promenade for pedestrians should be divided into four sections -- one for persons of leisure , one for those in a hurry , one for peddlers , and one for beggars . " " Highly original , " said the Bibliomaniac . " And so cheap , " added the School-master . " In no part of the world , " said the Idiot , in response to the last comment , " do we get something for nothing . Of course this scheme would be costly , but it would increase prosperity --  " " Ha ! ha ! " laughed the School-master , satirically . " Laugh away , but you can not gainsay my point . Our prosperity would increase , for we should not be always excavating to get at our pipes ; our surface cars with a clear track would gain for us rapid transit , our truck-drivers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way-side to overturn a coupe , or to run down a pedestrian ; our fine equipages would in consequence need fewer repairs ; and as for the pedestrians , the beggars , if relegated to themselves , would be forced out of business as would also the street-peddlers . The men in a hurry would not be delayed by loungers , beggars , and peddlers , and the loungers would derive inestimable benefit from the arrangement in the saving of wear and tear on their clothes and minds by contact with the busy world . " " It would be delightful , " acceded the School-master , " particularly on Sundays , when they were all loungers . " " Yes , " replied the Idiot . " It would be delightful then , especially in summer , when covered with an awning to shield promenaders from the sun . " Mr. Pedagog sighed , and the Bibliomaniac , wearily declining a second cup of coffee , left the table with the Doctor , earnestly discussing with that worthy gentleman the causes of weakmindedness . VIII " There 's a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he unfolded his napkin and let his bill flutter from it to the floor , " who 's tried to make a name for himself in literature . " " What 's his name ? " asked the Bibliomaniac , interested at once . " That 's just the trouble . He has n't made it yet , " replied the Idiot . " He has n't succeeded in his courtship of the Muse , and beyond himself and a few friends his name is utterly unknown . " " What work has he tried ? " queried the School-master , pouring unadmonished two portions of skimmed milk over his oatmeal . " A little of everything . First he wrote a novel . It had an immense circulation , and he only lost $300 on it . All of his friends took a copy -- I 've got one that he gave me -- and I believe two hundred newspapers were fortunate enough to secure the book for review . His father bought two , and tried to obtain the balance of the edition , but did n't have enough money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplete than to strengthen a bank account . " " I had not expected so extraordinarily wise an observation from one so unusually unwise , " said the School-master , coldly . " Thank you , " returned the Idiot . " But I think your remark is rather contradictory . You would naturally expect wise observations from the unusually unwise ; that is , if your teaching that the expression ' unusually unwise ' is but another form of the expression ' usually wise ' is correct . But , as I was saying , when the genial instructor of youth interrupted me with his flattery , " continued the Idiot , " gratification is gratifying but not filling , so my friend concluded that he had better give up novel-writing and try jokes . He kept at that a year , and managed to clear his postage-stamps . His jokes were good , but too classic for the tastes of the editors . Editors are peculiar . They have no respect for age -- particularly in the matter of jests . Some of my friend 's jokes had seemed good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mercy , but they did n't seem to suit the high and mighty products of this age who sit in judgment on such things in the comic-paper offices . So he gave up jokes . " Illustration : WOOING THE MUSE " Does he still know you ? " asked the landlady . " Yes , madame , " observed the Idiot . " Then he has n't given up all jokes , " she retorted , with fine scorn . " Tee-he-hee ! " laughed the School-master . " Pretty good , Mrs. Smithers -- pretty good . " " Yes , " said the Idiot . " That is good , and , by Jove ! it differs from your butter , Mrs. Smithers , because it 's entirely fresh . It 's good enough to print , and I do n't think the butter is . " " What did your friend do next ? " asked Mr. Whitechoker . " He was employed by a funeral director in Philadelphia to write obituary verses for memorial cards . " " And was he successful ? " " For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error made by a careless compositor in a marble-yard . He had written , " ' Here lies the hero of a hundred fights --  Approximated he a perfect man ; He fought for country and his country 's rights , And in the hottest battles led the van . ' " " Fine in sentiment and in execution ! " observed Mr. Whitechoker . " Truly so , " returned the Idiot . " But when the compositor in the marble-yard got it engraved on the monument , my friend was away , and when the army post that was to pay the bill received the monument , the quatrain read , " ' Here lies the hero of a hundred flights --  Approximated he a perfect one ; He fought his country and his country 's rights , And in the hottest battles led the run . ' " " Awful ! " ejaculated the Minister . " Dreadful ! " said the landlady , forgetting to be sarcastic . " What happened ? " asked the School-master . " He was bounced , of course , without a cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could n't make anything by suing for what they owed him . " " Mighty hard luck , " said the Bibliomaniac . " Very ; but there was one bright side to the case , " observed the Idiot . " He managed to sell both versions of the quatrain afterwards for five dollars . He sold the original one to a religious weekly for a dollar , and got four dollars for the other one from a comic paper . Then he wrote an anecdote about the whole thing for a Sunday newspaper , and got three dollars more out of it . " " And what is your friend doing now ? " asked the Doctor . " Oh , he 's making a mint of money now , but no name . " " In literature ? " " Yes . He writes advertisements on salary , " returned the Idiot . " He is writing now a recommendation of tooth-powder in Indian dialect . " " Why did n't he try writing an epic ? " said the Bibliomaniac . Illustration : " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied the Idiot , " the one aim of his life has been to be original , and he could n't reconcile that with epic poetry . " At which remark the landlady stooped over , and recovering the Idiot 's bill from under the table , called the maid , and ostentatiously requested her to hand it to the Idiot . He , taking a cigarette from his pocket , thanked the maid for the attention , and rolling the slip into a taper , thoughtfully stuck one end of it into the alcohol light under the coffee-pot , and lighting the cigarette with it , walked nonchalantly from the room . IX " I 've just been reading a book , " began the Idiot . " I thought you looked rather pale , " said the School-master . " Yes , " returned the Idiot , cheerfully , " it made me feel pale . It was about the pleasures of country life ; and when I contrasted rural blessedness as it was there depicted with urban life as we live it , I felt as if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were wasting my sweetness on the desert air . " " Why do n't you move ? " queried the Bibliomaniac , suggestively . " If I were purely selfish I should do so at once , but I am , like my good friend Mr. Whitechoker , a slave to duty . I deem it my duty to stay here to keep the School-master fully informed in the various branches of knowledge which are day by day opened up , many of which seem to be so far beyond the reach of one of his conservative habits ; to assist Mr. Whitechoker in his crusades against vice at this table and elsewhere ; to give the Bibliomaniac the benefit of my advice in regard to those precious little tomes he no longer buys -- to make life worth the living for all of you , to say nothing of enabling Mrs. Smithers to keep up the extraordinarily high standard of this house by means of the hard-earned stipend I pay to her every Monday morning . " " Every Monday ? " queried the School-master . " Every Monday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , every Monday that I pay . The things one gets to eat in the country , the air one breathes , the utter freedom from restraint , the thousand and more things one enjoys in the suburbs that are not attainable here -- it is these that make my heart yearn for the open . " Illustration : " ' A LITTLE GARDEN OF MY OWN , WHERE I COULD RAISE AN OCCASIONAL CAN OF TOMATOES ' " " Well , it 's all rot , " said the School-master , impatiently . " Country life is ideal only in books . Books do not tell of running for trains through blinding snowstorms ; writers do not expatiate on the delights of waking on cold winter nights and finding your piano and parlor furniture afloat because of bursted pipes , with the plumber , like Sheridan at Winchester , twenty miles away . They are dumb on the subject of the ecstasy one feels when pushing a twenty-pound lawn-mower up and down a weed patch at the end of a wearisome hot summer 's day . They are silent --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interrupted the Idiot . " I am not contemplating leaving you and Mrs. Smithers , but I do pine for a little garden of my own , where I could raise an occasional can of tomatoes . I dream sometimes of getting milk fresh from the pump , instead of twenty-four hours after it has been drawn , as we do here . In my musings it seems to me to be almost idyllic to have known a spring chicken in his infancy ; to have watched a hind-quarter of lamb gambolling about its native heath before its muscles became adamant , and before chopped-up celery tops steeped in vinegar were poured upon it in the hope of hypnotizing boarders into the belief that spring lamb and mint-sauce lay before them . What care I how hard it is to rise every morning before six in winter to thaw out the boiler , so long as the night coming finds me seated in the genial glow of the gas log ! What man is he that would complain of having to bale out his cellar every week , if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility that keeps its floor sheeny , soft , and green -- an interior tennis-court -- from spring to spring , causing the gladsome click of the lawn-mower to be heard within its walls all through the still watches of the winter day ? I tell you , sir , it is the life to lead , that of our rural brother . I do not believe that in this whole vast city there is a cellar like that -- an in-door garden-patch , as it were . " Illustration : " ' A HIND-QUARTER OF LAMB GAMBOLLING ABOUT ITS NATIVE HEATH ' " " No , " returned the Doctor ; " and it is a good thing there is n't . There is enough sickness in the world without bringing any of your rus ideas in urbe . I 've lived in the country , sir , and I assure you it is not what it is written up to be . Country life is misery , melancholy , and malaria . " " You must have struck a profitable section , Doctor , " returned the Idiot , taking possession of three steaming buckwheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to reach out for them himself . " And I should have supposed that your good business sense would have restrained you from leaving . " " Then the countryman is poor -- always poor , " continued the Doctor , ignoring the Idiot 's sarcastic comments . " Ah ! that accounts for it , " observed the Idiot . " I see why you did not stay ; for what shall it profit a man to save a patient if practice , like virtue , is to be its own reward ? " " Your suggestion , sir , " retorted the Doctor , " betrays an unhealthy frame of mind . " " That 's all right , Doctor , " returned the Idiot ; " but please do not diagnose the case any further . I ca n't afford an expert opinion as to my mental condition . But to return to our subject : you two gentlemen appear to have had unhappy experiences in country life -- quite different from those of a friend of mine who owns a farm .

He is never afraid of losing his house or barns by fire , because the whole fire department of the neighboring village is , to a man , in love with the house-keeper 's daughter , and is always on hand in force . The chickens are the envy and pride of the county , and there are so many of them that they have to take turns in going to roost . The pigs are the most intelligent of their kind , and are so happy they never grunt . In fact , everything is lovely and cheap , the only thing that hangs high being the goose .

The weeds in the garden grow so fast , I suppose , that they pull themselves up by the roots ; and if there is anything left undone at the end of the day I presume tramps in dress suits , and courtly in manner , spring out of the ground and finish up for him .

I see him on the street every day . " " Does he employ a man to run the farm ? " asked the Clergyman . " No , " returned the Idiot , " he has too much sense and too few dollars to do any such foolish thing as that . " " It must be one of those self-winding stock farms , " put in the School-master , scornfully . " But I do n't see how he can be a successful broker and make money off his farm at the same time .

" " Then you have got us into an argument about country life that ends --  " began the School-master , indignantly . " That ends where it leaves off , " retorted the Idiot , departing with a smile on his lips . " He 's an Idiot from Idaho , " asserted the Bibliomaniac . " Yes ; but I 'm afraid idiocy is a little contagious , " observed the Doctor , with a grin and sidelong glance at the School-master . X " Good-morning , gentlemen , " said the Idiot , as he seated himself at the breakfast-table and glanced over his mail . " Good-morning yourself , " returned the Poet . " You have an unusually large number of letters this morning . All checks , I hope ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All checks of one kind or another .

" I try to , " returned the Idiot , meekly . " If the papers do n't take ' em , I find them useful in curing my genial friend who imbibes of insomnia . " " What do you write -- advertisements ? " queried the Bibliomaniac . " No . Advertisement writing is an art to which I dare not aspire . It 's too great a tax on the brain , " replied the Idiot . " Tax on what ? " asked the Doctor . He was going to squelch the Idiot . " The brain , " returned the latter , not ready to be squelched . " It 's a little thing people use to think with , Doctor . I 'd advise you to get one .

" How did you suppose -- with an oyster-knife ? " The clergyman sighed . " I should like to hear some of your poems , " said the Poet . " Very well , " returned the Idiot . " Here 's one that has just returned from the Bengal Monthly . It 's about a writer who died some years ago . Shakespeare 's his name . You 've heard of Shakespeare , have n't you , Mr. Pedagog ?

" How many yards long do you think epigrams should be ? " The Bibliomaniac scorned to reply . " I agree with the Bibliomaniac , " said the School-master . " It is too short .

" ' As boys , we went to school , and Jim , of course , Was e'er his teacher 's favorite , and ranked Among the lads renowned for moral force , Whilst I was every day right soundly spanked . " ' Jim had an angel face , but there he stopped . I never knew a lad who 'd sin so oft And look so like a branch of heaven lopped From off the parent trunk that grows aloft .

" And only shows how in weak hands so beautiful a thing as the sonnet can be made ridiculous . " " What 's wrong with it ? " asked the Idiot . " It does n't contain any thought -- or if it does , no one can tell what the thought is . Your rhymes are atrocious . Your phraseology is ridiculous . The whole thing is bad . You 'll never get anybody to print it . " " I do not intend to try , " said the Idiot , meekly . " You are wise , " said the School-master , " to take my advice for once . " " No , it is not your advice that restrains me , " said the Idiot , dryly . " It is the fact that this sonnet has already been printed . " " In the name of Letters , where ? " cried the School-master . " In the collected works of William Shakespeare , " replied the Idiot , quietly . The Poet laughed ; Mrs. Smithers 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had absolutely nothing to say . XI " Do you believe , Mr. Whitechoker , " said the Idiot , taking his place at the table , and holding his plate up to the light , apparently to see whether or not it was immaculate , whereat the landlady sniffed contemptuously --  " do you believe that the love of money is the root of all evil ? " " I have always been of that impression , " returned Mr. Whitechoker , pleasantly . " In fact , I am sure of it , " he added . " There is no evil thing in this world , sir , that can not be traced back to a point where greed is found to be its main-spring and the source of its strength . " " Then how do you reconcile this with the scriptural story of the forbidden fruit ? Do you think the apples referred to were figures of speech , the true import of which was that Adam and Eve had their eyes on the original surplus ? " " Well , of course , there you begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Original root of all evil , " prompted the Idiot , calmly . " Precisely , " returned Mr. Whitechoker , with a sigh of relief . " Mrs. Smithers , I think I 'll have a dash of hot-water in my coffee this morning . " Then , with a nervous glance towards the Idiot , he added , addressing the Bibliomaniac , " I think it looks like rain . " " Referring to the coffee , Mr. Whitechoker ? " queried the Idiot , not disposed to let go of his victim quite so easily . " Ah -- I do n't quite follow you , " replied the Minister , with some annoyance . " You said something looked like rain , and I asked you if the thing you referred to was the coffee , for I was disposed to agree with you , " said the Idiot . " I am sure , " put in Mrs. Smithers , " that a gentleman of Mr. Whitechoker 's refinement would not make any such insinuation , sir . He is not the man to quarrel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLDING HIS PLATE UP TO THE LIGHT " " I ask your pardon , madam , " returned the Idiot , politely . " I hope that I am not the man to quarrel with my food , either . Indeed , I make it a rule to avoid unpleasantness of all sorts , particularly with the weak , under which category we find your coffee . I simply wish to know to what Mr. Whitechoker refers when he says ' it looks like rain . ' " " I mean , of course , " said the Minister , with as much calmness as he could command -- and that was not much --  " I mean the day . The day looks as if it might be rainy . " " Any one with a modicum of brain knows what you meant , Mr. Whitechoker , " volunteered the School-master . " Certainly , " observed the Idiot , scraping the butter from his toast ; " but to those who have more than a modicum of brains my reverend friend 's remark was not entirely clear . If I am talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like snow , I know exactly what he means . He does n't mean that the day looks like snow , however ; he refers to the cotton . Mr. Whitechoker , talking about coffee , chooses to state that it looks like rain , which it undoubtedly does . I , realizing that , as Mrs. Smithers says , it is not the gentleman 's habit to attack too violently the food which is set before him , manifest some surprise , and , giving the gentleman the benefit of the doubt , afford him an opportunity to set himself right . " " Change the subject , " said the Bibliomaniac , curtly . " With pleasure , " answered the Idiot , filling his glass with cream . " We 'll change the subject , or the object , or anything you choose . We 'll have another breakfast , or another variety of biscuits frappe -- anything , in short , to keep peace at the table . Tell me , Mr. Pedagog , " he added , " is the use of the word ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' perfectly correct ? " " I do n't know why it is not , " returned the School-master , uneasily . He was not at all desirous of parleying with the Idiot . " And is it correct to suppose that ' it ' refers to the day -- is the day supposed to look like rain ? or do we simply use ' it ' to express a condition which confronts us ? " " It refers to the latter , of course . " " Then the full text of Mr. Whitechoker 's remark is , I suppose , that ' the rainy condition of the atmosphere which confronts us looks like rain ? ' " " Oh , I suppose so , " sighed the School-master , wearily . " Rather an unnecessary sort of statement that ! " continued the Idiot . " It 's something like asserting that a man looks like himself , or , as in the case of a child 's primer --  " ' See the cat ? ' " ' Yes , I see the cat . ' " ' What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . Scat cat ! ' " At this even Mrs. Smithers smiled . " I do n't agree with Mr. Pedagog , " put in the Bibliomaniac , after a pause . Here the School-master shook his head warningly at the Bibliomaniac , as if to indicate that he was not in good form . " So I observe , " remarked the Idiot . " You have upset him completely . See how Mr. Pedagog trembles ? " he added , addressing the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed . Illustration : " ' I BELIEVE YOU 'D BLOW OUT THE GAS IN YOUR BED-ROOM ' " " I do n't mean that way , " sneered the Bibliomaniac , bound to set Mr. Whitechoker straight . " I mean that the word ' it , ' as employed in that sentence , stands for day . The day looks like rain . " " Did you ever see a day ? " queried the Idiot . " Certainly I have , " returned the Bibliomaniac . " What does it look like ? " was the calmly put question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for safety , and the manner in which his face colored aroused considerable interest in the breast of the Doctor , who was a good deal of a specialist in apoplexy . " Was it a whole day you saw , or only a half-day ? " persisted the Idiot . " You may think you are very funny , " retorted the Bibliomaniac . " I think you are --  " " Now do n't get angry , " returned the Idiot . " There are two or three things I do not know , and I 'm anxious to learn . I 'd like to know how a day looks to one to whom it is a visible object . If it is visible , is it tangible ? and , if so , how does it feel ? " " The visible is always tangible , " asserted the School-master , recklessly . " How about a red-hot stove , or manifest indignation , or a view from a mountain-top , or , as in the case of the young man in the novel who ' suddenly waked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one ? ' " returned the Idiot , imperturbably . " Tut ! " ejaculated the Bibliomaniac . " If I had brains like yours , I 'd blow them out . " " Yes , I think you would , " observed the Idiot , folding up his napkin . " You 're just the man to do a thing like that . I believe you 'd blow out the gas in your bedroom if there was n't a sign over it requesting you not to . " And filling his match-box from the landlady 's mantel supply , the Idiot hurried from the room , and soon after left the house . XII " If my father had n't met with reverses --  " the Idiot began . " Did you really have a father ? " interrupted the School-master . " I thought you were one of these self-made Idiots . How terrible it must be for a man to think that he is responsible for you ! " " Yes , " rejoined the Idiot ; " my father finds it rather hard to stand up under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gentleman , and he manages to bear the burden very well with the aid of my mother -- for I have a mother , too , Mr. Pedagog . A womanly mother she is , too , with all the natural follies , such as fondness for and belief in her boy . Why , it would soften your heart to see how she looks on me . She thinks I am the most everlastingly brilliant man she ever knew -- excepting father , of course , who has always been a hero of heroes in her eyes , because he never rails at misfortune , never spoke an unkind word to her in his life , and just lives gently along and waiting for the end of all things . " Illustration : " ' HIS FAIRY STORIES WERE TOLD HIM IN WORDS OF TEN SYLLABLES ' " " Do you think it is right in you to deceive your mother in this way -- making her think you a young Napoleon of intellect when you know you are an Idiot ? " observed the Bibliomaniac , with a twinkle in his eye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly . " It 's my place to make the old folks happy if I can ; and if thinking me nineteen different kinds of a genius is going to fill my mother 's heart with happiness , I 'm going to let her think it . What 's the use of destroying other people 's idols even if we do know them to be hollow mockeries ? Do you think you do a praiseworthy act , for instance , when you kick over the heathen 's stone gods and leave him without any at all ? You may not have noticed it , but I have -- that it is easier to pull down an idol than it is to rear an ideal . I have had idols shattered myself , and I have n't found that the pedestals they used to occupy have been rented since . They are there yet and empty -- standing as monuments to what once seemed good to me -- and I 'm no happier nor no better for being disillusioned . So it is with my mother . I let her go on and think me perfect . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes me try to live up to that idea of hers as to what I am . If she had the same opinion of me that we all have she 'd be the most miserable woman in the world . " " We do n't all think so badly of you , " said the Doctor , rather softened by the Idiot 's remarks . " No , " put in the Bibliomaniac . " You are all right . You breathe normally , and you have nice blue eyes . You are graceful and pleasant to look upon , and if you 'd been born dumb we 'd esteem you very highly . It is only your manners and your theories that we do n't like ; but even in these we are disposed to believe that you are a well-meaning child . " " That is precisely the way to put it , " assented the School-master . " You are harmless even when most annoying . For my own part , I think the most objectionable feature about you is that you suffer from that unfortunately not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your age , and if you only would n't talk , I think we should get on famously together . " " You overwhelm me with your compliments , " said the Idiot . " I am sorry I am so young , but I can not be brought to believe that that is my own fault . One must live to attain age , and how the deuce can one live when one boards ? " As no one ventured to reply to this question , the force of which very evidently , however , was fully appreciated by Mrs. Smithers , the Idiot continued : Illustration : " ' I THOUGHT MY FATHER A MEAN-SPIRITED ASSASSIN ' " " Youth is thrust upon us in our infancy , and must be endured until such a time as Fate permits us to account ourselves cured . It swoops down upon us when we have neither the strength nor the brains to resent it . Of course there are some superior persons in this world who never were young . Mr. Pedagog , I doubt not , was ushered into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wailing as most infants are , but discussing the most abstruse philosophical problems . His fairy stories were told him , if ever , in words of ten syllables ; and his father 's first remark to him was doubtless an inquiry as to his opinion on the subject of Latin and Greek in our colleges . It 's all right to be this kind of a baby if you like that sort of thing . For my part , I rejoice to think that there was once a day when I thought my father a mean-spirited assassin , because he would n't tie a string to the moon and let me make it rise and set as suited my sweet will . Babies of Mr. Pedagog 's sort are fortunately like angel 's visits , few and far between . In spite of his stand in the matter , though , I ca n't help thinking there was a great deal of truth in a rhyme a friend of mine got off on Youth . It fits the case . He said : " ' Youth is a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is but a crime --  And , like the mumps , most aged men complain , It ca n't be caught , alas ! a second time . " ' " Your rhymes are interesting , and your reasoning , as usual , is faulty , " said the School-master . " I passed a very pleasant childhood , though it was a childhood devoted , as you have insinuated , to serious rather than to flippant pursuits . I was n't particularly fond of tag and hide-and-seek , nor do I think that even as an infant I ever cried for the moon . " " It would have expanded your chest if you had , Mr. Pedagog , " observed the Idiot , quietly . " So it would , but I never found myself short-winded , sir , " retorted the School-master , with some acerbity . " That is evident ; but go on , " said the Idiot . " You never passed a childish youth nor a youthful childhood , and therefore what ? " " Therefore , in my present condition , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back upon , no indiscretions to regret ; I never knowingly told a lie , and --  " " All of which proves that you never were young , " put in the Idiot ; " and you will excuse me if I say it , but my father is the model for me rather than so exalted a personage as yourself . He is still young , though turned seventy , and I do n't believe on his own account there ever was a boy who played hookey more , who prevaricated oftener , who purloined others ' fruits with greater frequency than he . He was guilty of every crime in the calendar of youth ; and if there is one thing that delights him more than another , it is to sit on a winter 's night before the crackling log and tell us yarns about his youthful follies and his boyhood indiscretions . " " But is he normally a happy man ? " queried the School-master . " No . " " Ah ! " " No . He 's an abnormally happy man , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon and not forward to . " " Ahem ! " said Mrs. Smithers . " Dear me ! " ejaculated Mr. Whitechoker . Mr. Pedagog said nothing , and the breakfast-room was soon deserted . XIII There was an air of suppressed excitement about Mrs. Smithers and Mr. Pedagog as they sat down to breakfast . Something had happened , but just what that something was no one as yet knew , although the genial old gentleman had a sort of notion as to what it was . " Pedagog has been good-natured enough for an engaged man for nearly a week now , " he whispered to the Idiot , who had asked him what he supposed was up , " and I have a half idea that Mrs. S. has at last brought him to the point of proposing . " " It 's the other way , I imagine , " returned the Idiot . " You do n't really think she has rejected him , do you ? " queried the genial old gentleman . " Oh no ; not by a great deal . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought her to the point . This is leap-year , you know , " said the Idiot . " Well , if I were a betting man , which I have n't been since night before last , I 'd lay you a wager that they 're engaged , " said the old gentleman . " I 'm glad you 've given up betting , " rejoined the Idiot , " because I 'm sure I 'd take the bet if you offered it -- and then I believe I 'd lose . " " We are to have Philadelphia spring chickens this morning , gentlemen , " said Mrs. Smithers , beaming upon all at the table . " It 's a special treat . " " Which we all appreciate , my dear Mrs. Smithers , " observed the Idiot , with a courteous bow to his landlady . " And , by the way , why is it that Philadelphia spring chickens do not appear until autumn , do you suppose ? Is it because Philadelphia spring does n't come around until it is autumn everywhere else ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think it is because Philadelphia spring chickens are not sufficiently hardened to be able to stand the strain of exportation much before September , or else Philadelphia people do not get so sated with such delicacies as to permit any of the crop to go into other than Philadelphia markets before that period . For my part , I simply love them . " Illustration : " ' MRS . S. BROUGHT HIM TO THE POINT OF PROPOSING ' " " So do I , " said the Idiot ; " and if Mrs. Smithers will pardon me for expressing a preference for any especial part of the piece de resistance , I will state to her that if , in helping me , she will give me two drumsticks , a pair of second joints , and plenty of the white meat , I shall be very happy . " " You ought to have said so yesterday , " said the School-master , with a surprisingly genial laugh . " Then Mrs. Smithers could have prepared an individual chicken for you . " " That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I should really hesitate to eat too much spring chicken . I never did it in my life , and do n't know what the effect would be . Would it be harmful , Doctor ? " " I really do not know how it would be , " answered the Doctor . " In all my wide experience I have never found a case of the kind . " " It 's very rarely that one gets too much spring chicken , " said Mr. Whitechoker . " I have n't had any experience with patients , as my friend the Doctor has ; but I have lived in many boarding-houses , and I have never yet known of any one even getting enough . " " Well , perhaps we shall have all we want this morning , " said Mrs. Smithers . " I hope so , at any rate , for I wish this day to be a memorable one in our house . Mr. Pedagog has something to tell you . John , will you announce it now ? " " Did you hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' John . ' " " Yes , " said the genial old gentleman . " I did n't know Pedagog had a first name before . " " Certainly , my dear -- that is , my very dear Mrs. Smithers , " stammered the School-master , getting red in the face . " The fact is , gentlemen -- ahem !  -- I -- er -- we -- er -- that is , of course -- er -- Mrs . Smithers has er -- ahem !  - -  Mrs . Smithers has asked me to be her -- I -- er -- I should say I have asked Mrs. Smithers to be my husb -- my wife , and -- er -- she --  " " Hoorah ! " cried the Idiot , jumping up from the table and grasping Mr. Pedagog by the hand . " Hoorah ! You 've got in ahead of us , old man , but we are just as glad when we think of your good-fortune . Your gain may be our loss -- but what of that where the happiness of our dear landlady is at stake ? " Mrs. Smithers glanced coyly at the Idiot and smiled . " Thank you , " said the School-master . " You are welcome , " said the Idiot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felicitate you upon this happy event . I , who have so often differed with Mr. Pedagog upon matters of human knowledge , am forced to admit that upon this occasion he has shown such eminently good sense that you are fortunate , indeed , to have won him . " " Again I thank you , " said the School-master . " You are a very sensible person yourself , my dear Idiot ; perhaps my failure to appreciate you at times in the past has been due to your brilliant qualities , which have so dazzled me that I have been unable to see you as you really are . " " Here are the chickens , " said Mrs. Smithers . " Ah ! " ejaculated the Idiot . " What lucky fellows we are , to be sure ! I hope , Mrs. Smithers , now that Mr. Pedagog has cut us all out , you will at least be a sister to the rest of us , and let us live at home . " Illustration : " ' HOORAH ! ' CRIED THE IDIOT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be no change , " said Mrs. Smithers --  " at least , I hope not , except that Mr. Pedagog will take a more active part in the management of our home . " " I do n't envy him that , " said the Idiot . " We shall be severe critics , and it will be hard work for him to manage affairs better than you did , Mrs. Smithers . " " Mary , get me a larger cup for the Idiot 's coffee , " said Mrs. Smithers . " Let 's all retire from business , " suggested the Idiot , after the other guests had expressed their satisfaction with the turn affairs had taken . " Let 's retire from business , and change the Smithers Home for Boarders into an Educational Institution . " " For what purpose ? " queried the Bibliomaniac . " Everything is so lovely now , " explained the Idiot , " that I feel as though I never wanted to leave the house again , even to win a fortune . If we turn it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the front door excepting for pleasure . " " Where will the money and the instructors come from ? " asked Mr. Whitechoker . " Money ? From pupils ; and after we get going maybe somebody will endow us . As for instructors , I think we know enough to be instructors ourselves , " replied the Idiot . " For instance : Pedagog 's University . John Pedagog , President ; Alonzo B. Whitechoker , Chaplain ; Mrs. Smithers-Pedagog , Matron . For Professor of Belles-lettres , the Bibliomaniac , assisted by the Poet ; Medical Lectures by Dr. Capsule ; Chemistry taught by our genial friend who occasionally imbibes ; Chair in General Information , your humble servant . Why , we would be overrun with pupils and money in less than a year . " " A very good idea , " returned Mr. Pedagog . " I have often thought that a nice little school could be started here to advantage , though I must confess that I had different ideas on the subject of the instructors . You , my dear Idiot , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hm ! " said the Idiot . " It sounds mighty well -- I 've no doubt I should like it . What is a Professor Emeritus , Mr. Pedagog ? " " He is a professor who is paid a salary for doing nothing . " The whole table joined in a laugh , the Idiot included . " By Jove ! Mr. Pedagog , " he said , as soon as he could speak , " you are just dead right about that . That 's the place of places for me . Salary and nothing to do ! Oh , how I 'd love it ! " The rest of the breakfast was eaten in silence . The spring chickens were too good and too plentiful to admit of much waste of time in conversation . At the conclusion of the meal the Idiot rose from the table , and , after again congratulating Mr. Pedagog and his fiancee , announced that he was going to see his employer . " On Sunday ? " queried Mrs. Smithers . " Yes ; I want him to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully . " " And why , pray ? " asked Mr. Pedagog . " I 'm going to apply to the Trustees of Columbia College the first thing to-morrow morning for an Emeritus Professorship , for if anybody can do nothing and draw money for it gracefully I 'm the man . Wall Street is too wearing on my nerves , " he replied . And in a moment he was gone . " I like him , " said Mrs. Smithers . " So do I , " said Mr. Pedagog . " He is n't half the idiot he thinks he is . " THE END By LILIAN BELL A Little Sister to the Wilderness . A Novel . New Edition . 16mo , Cloth , Ornamental , Uncut Edges and Gilt Top , $1 25 . The story is a pathetic one in many ways , for it portrays so strongly human lowliness and degradation . The writer is well acquainted with the life and habits and dialect of the West Tennessee bottoms , and her story is written from the heart and with rare sympathy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby " store , " the emotional Methodist meeting , which lasts a week , having two sessions daily -- all these are vividly sketched . Mag , the heroine , is a well-drawn character . Camden , the hero , is forceful and earnest . The story is valuable because it shows so forcefully the peculiar phases of the life and human character of these people . The writer has a natural and fluent style , and her dialect has the double excellence of being novel and scanty . The scenes are picturesque and diversified.  - -  Churchman , N. Y.
