txt Mr. CHOKER startles his own people by the austerity of his commands . It is needless to say that he surprises the oppo , nents of Tammany . They had not expected of him this rigor in proclaiming the policy of the-new administration and in prescribing rules of conduct for its officers . Their pleasure and gratification at Mr. CROMER 'S announcement will be tempered only by such doubts as they may harbor as to his good faith and his ability to carry on the government on this high plane with the instruments he has chosen . We may be perfectly sure that the instruments themselves , or the majority of them , never counted ? on becoming part of an administration'tb ! barren of opportunity and so exigent of faithful service . The philosophy and the theory of government by party organization were never traced with a firmer hand than in Mr. CROKER 'S address to the Executive Committee of Tammany Hall : " The great trust confided to us by the people must not and will not be abused . They have selected our organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must show by our conduct of that agency that we appreciate and merit the confidence reposed in us . This can be done in no better way than by giving the people an efficient , honest , and economical administration ; one that will ... be satisfactory to the people and creditable to the organization . If we do this , success will crown our efforts , we will rise in the estimation of the people , and our organization will become invincible . If we do n't do it , we are gone . Remember that . " He must be a very mean-spirited " reformer " who does not frankly admit that SETH Low could not have said this better or in more unequivocal language . It is an unreserved commitment to clean and efficient administration . Again : " The creation of unnecessary places or sinecures will not be tolerated . Our organization will insist that every man whose name appears upon the city 's pay roll must earn his salary . No head of a department , or any other official , will be asked by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his position in its councils , to violate any law or break any rule for any purpose whatsoever Let no man be unfaithful to his trust , for should be be he will not find a more unrelenting and vigorous prosecutor than will be the Tammany Hall organization . " You must toe the mark or out you go , says the chief , addressing all the subordinates at once . There can be no doubt about the kind of mark Intended . It is a straight mark . There are not two standards of efficiency and faithfulness in office . Mr. CROK:ER 'S words must be taken to mean good administration ? just as good as SETH Low would have meant had he spoken them . Accordingly , every honest-minded friend of good city government is bound to applaud this announcement of Tammany policy . The supporters of Mr. Low are bound to welcome it as a promise that most of the things they sought to achieve with Mr. Low may be achieved without him . The best attainable government is just as good for the citizen and taxpayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes through the Citizens ' Union . It is easy to talk of the unchangeable stripes of the tiger , and , in truth , full faith in advance of works is too much to ask of anybody . Mr. CHOKER does not ask that . We are on trial , he says . Let us show the people that our government is good and honest . Respect for public opinion and a desire for its approbation are the foundation stones of this policy . There is no other check upon the present City Government . It has all the power . It is a piece of inestimable good fortune for the city that the Government evinces a controlling sense of responsibility to the people . It intends also that it shall be an undivided responsibility . It has put- out trained , capable public servants and replaced them with organization men of visibly inferior capacity . That would be ruinous in business . It must impair the efficiency of those branches of the Government in which the changes have been made . But the credit of success and the blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r-enortam , - while he is- not
