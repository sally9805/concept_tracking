Main text I. IN THE PARLOUR OF THE PONKWASSET HOTEL . I. Miss Maggie Wallace and Miss Lilly Roberts . THE Ponkwasset Hotel stands on the slope of a hill and fronts the irregular mass of Ponkwasset Mountain , on which the galleries and northern windows of the parlour look out . The parlour is furnished with two hair-cloth sofas , two hair-cloth easy-chairs , and cane-seated chairs of divers patterns ; against one side of the room stands a piano , near either end of which a door opens into the corridor ; in the centre of the parlour a marble-topped table supports a state-lamp of kerosene ,  --  a perfume by day , a flame by night ,  --  and near this table sit two young ladies with what they call work in their hands and laps . Miss Maggie Wallace , Miss Maggie Wallace with her left wrist curved in the act of rolling up a part of her work , at which she looks down with a very thoughtful air and a careworn little sigh .  --  " I do n't think I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Lilly Roberts , Miss Lilly Roberts letting her work fall into her lap in amazement .  --  " Why , Maggie ! " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " No . Or at least I sha n't decide to do so till I 've had Leslie 's opinion on it . She has perfect taste , and she could tell at a glance whether it would do . " Lilly .  --  Miss Lilly Roberts " I wonder she is n't here , now . The stage must be very late . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " I suppose the postmaster at South Herodias waited to finish his supper before he ' changed the mail , ' as they call it . I was so in hopes she would come while they were at tea ! It will so disgust her to see them all strung along the piazza and staring their eyes out at the arrivals , when the stage drives up , "  --  a horrible picture which Miss Wallace dreamily contemplates for a moment in mental vision . Lilly .  --  Miss Lilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maggie ? Perhaps she 'd find a familiar face a relief . " Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace recalled to herself by the wild suggestion .  --  " Thank you , Lilly . I 'd rather not be thought so vulgar as that , by Leslie Bellingham , if it 's quite the same to other friends . Imagine her catching sight of me in that crowd ! I should simply wither away . " Lilly , Miss Lilly Roberts rebelliously.  --  " Well , I do n't see why she should feel authorised to overawe people in that manner . What does she do to show her immense superiority ? " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Everything ! In the first place she 's so refined and cultivated , you ca n't live ; and then she takes your breath away , she 's so perfectly lovely ; and then she kills you dead with her style , and all that . She is n't the least stiff . She 's the kindest to other people you ever saw , and the care-fullest of their feelings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinely impulsive ! But somehow you feel that if you do anything that 's a little vulgar in her presence , you 'd better die at once . It was always so at school , and it always will be . Why , you would no more dare to do or say anything just a little common , do n't you know , with Leslie Bellingham "  --  A young lady , tall , slender , and with an air of delicate distinction , has appeared at the door of the parlour . She is of that American fineness and grace ; she is fair , and her eyes are rather grey than blue ; her nose is slightly aquiline ; her expression is serious , but becomes amused as she listens to Miss Wallace . She wears one of those blonde travelling costumes , whose general fashionableness she somehow subdues into character with herself ; over her arm she carries a shawl . She drifts lightly into the room . At the rustling of her dress Miss Wallace looks up , and with a cry of surprise and ecstasy springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every direction over the floor , and flings herself into Miss Leslie Bellingham 's embrace . Then she starts away from her and gazes rapturously into her face , while they prettily clasp hands and hold each other at arm 's length .  --  " Leslie ! You heard every word ! " II . Miss Leslie Bellingham , Maggie , and Lilly . Leslie .  --  Leslie " Every syllable , my child . And when you came to my grand principles , I simply said to myself , ' Then listening at keyholes is heroic , ' and kept on eavesdropping without a murmur . Had you quite finished ? " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " O Leslie ! You know I never can finish when I get on that subject ! It inspires me to greater and greater flights every minute . Where is your mother ? Where is Mrs. Murray ? Where is the stage ? Why , excuse me ! This is Miss Roberts . Lilly , it 's Leslie Bellingham ! Oh , how glad I am to see you together at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie having graciously bowed to Miss Roberts .  --  " No , Maggie . The stage did n't bring me here . I walked . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Why , Leslie ! How perfectly ghastly ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " The stage has done nothing but disgrace itself ever since we left the station . In the first place it pretended to carry ten or twelve people and their baggage , with two horses . Four horses ought n't to drag such a load up these precipices ; and wherever the driver would stop for me , I insisted upon getting out to walk . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " How like you , Leslie ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Yes ; I wish the resemblance were not so striking . I 'm here in character , Maggie , if you like , but almost nothing else . I 've nothing but a hand-bag to bless me with for the next twenty-four hours . Shall you be very much ashamed of me ? " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've lost your trunks ? Horrors ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " No . I mean that I was n't going to let the driver add them to the cruel load he had already , and I made him leave them at the station till to-morrow night . " Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace embracing her .  --  " Oh , you dear , good , grand , generous Leslie ! How  --  Why , but Leslie ! He 'll have just as many people to-morrow night , and your trunks besides theirs ! " Leslie , Leslie with decision .  --  " Very well ! Then I shall not be there to see the outrage . I will not have suffering or injustice of any kind inflicted in my presence , if I can help it . That is all . " Nevertheless , Miss Bellingham sinks into one of the arm-chairs with an air of some dismay , and vainly taps the toe of her boot with the point of her umbrella in a difficult interval of silence . Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace finally .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie with mystery .  --  " Oh , he 's bringing it . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " He ? " Leslie , Leslie with reviving spirits .  --  " A young man , the good genius of the drive . He 's bringing it from the foot of the hill ; the stage had its final disaster there ; and I left him in charge of mamma and aunt Kate , and came on to explore and surprise , and he made me leave the bag with him , too . But that is n't the worst . I shall know what to do with the hand-bag when it gets here , but I sha n't know what to do with the young man . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " With the young man ? Why , Leslie , a young man is worth a thousand hand-bags in a place like this ! You do n't know what you 're talking about , Leslie . A young man "  --  Leslie , Leslie rising and going toward the window .  --  " My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well make up your mind to that , for you 'll see at once that he 'll never do . He 's going to stop here , and as he 's been very kind to us it makes his never doing all the harder to manage . He 's a hero , if you like , but if you can imagine it , he is n't quite  --  well , what you 've been used to . Do n't you see how a person could be everything that was unselfish and obliging , and yet not  --  not "  --  Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace eagerly .  --  " Oh yes ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Well , he 's that . It seems to me that he 's been doing something for mamma , or aunt Kate , or me , ever since we left the station . To begin with , he gave up his place inside to one of us , and when he went to get on top , he found all the places taken there ; and so he had to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked most of the way , and helped me over the bad places in the road when I insisted on getting out . You know how aunt Kate is , Maggie , and how many wants she has . Well , there was n't one of them that this young man did n't gratify : he handed her bag up to the driver on top because it crowded her , and handed it down because she could n't do without it ; he got her out and put her back so that she could face the front , and then restored her to her place because an old gentleman who had been travelling a long way kept falling asleep on her shoulder ; he buttoned her curtain down because she was sure it was going to rain , and rolled it up because it made the air too close ; he fetched water for her ; he looked every now and then to see if her trunks were all right , and made her more and more ungrateful every minute . Whenever the stage broke down  --  as it did twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ladies , quieted children , and shamed the other men into trying to be of some use ; and if it had n't been for him , I do n't see how the stage would ever have got out of its troubles ; he always knew just what was the matter , and just how to mend it . Is that the window that commands a magnificent prospect of Ponkwasset Mountain  --  in the advertisement ? " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " The very window ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Does it condescend to overlook so common a thing as the road up to the house ? " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Of course ; but why ? " Leslie , Leslie going to the open window , and stepping through it upon the gallery , whither the other young ladies follow her , and where her voice is heard .  --  " Yes , there they come ! But I ca n't see my young man . Is it possible that he 's riding ? No , there he is ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you see him ? Why , he need n't carry my hand-bag ! He certainly might have let that ride . I do wonder what he means by it ! Or is it only absent-mindedness ? Do n't let him see us looking ! It would be altogether too silly . Do let 's go in ! " Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace on their return to the parlour .  --  " What a great pity it is that he wo n't do ! Is he handsome , Leslie ? Why wo n't he do ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " You can tell in a moment , when you 've seen him , Maggie . He 's perfectly respectful and nice , of course , but he 's no more social perspective than  --  the man in the moon . He 's never obtrusive , but he 's as free and equal as the Declaration of Independence ; and when you did get up some little perspective with him , and tried to let him know , do n't you know , that there was such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do or say something so unconscious that away went your perspective  --  one simple crush . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " How ridiculous ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Yes . It was funny . But not just in that way . He is n't in the least common or uncouth . Nobody could say that . But he 's going to be here two or three weeks , and it 's impossible not to be civil ; and it 's very embarrassing , do n't you see ? " Lilly .  --  Miss Lilly Roberts " Let me comfort you , Miss Bellingham . It will be the simplest thing in the world . We 're all on the same level in the Ponkwasset Hotel . The landlord will bring him up during the evening and introduce him . Our table girls teach school in the winter and are as good as anybody . Mine calls me ' Lilly , ' and I 'm so small I ca n't help it . They dress up in the afternoon , and play the piano . The cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as can be . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Lilly ! " Leslie , Leslie listening to Miss Roberts with whimsical trepidation .  --  " Well , this certainly complicates matters . But I think we shall be able to manage . " At a sound of voices in the hall without , Miss Bellingham starts from her chair and runs to the corridor , where she is heard .  --  " Thanks ever so much . So very good of you to take all this trouble . Come into the parlour , mamma  --  there 's nobody there but Maggie Wallace and Miss Roberts  --  and we 'll leave our things there till after tea . " She re-enters the parlour with her mother and her aunt Kate , Mrs. Murray ; after whom comes Stephen Blake with Leslie 's bag in his hand , and the wraps of the other ladies over his arm . His dress , which is evidently a prosperous fortuity of the clothing-store , takes character from his tall , sinewy frame ; a smile of somewhat humorous patience lights his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waits in quiet self-possession the pleasure of the ladies . III . Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Murray , and the Young Girls . Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham a matronly , middle-aged lady of comfortable , not cumbrous bulk , taking Miss Wallace by the hand and kissing her .  --  " My dear child , how pleasant it is to see you so strong again ! You 're a living testimony to the excellence of the air ! How well you look ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Mamma ,  --  Miss Roberts . " Mrs. Bellingham murmurously shakes hands with Miss Roberts , and after some kindly nods and smiles , and other shows of friendliness , provisionally and expectantly quiesces into a corner of the sofa , while her sister-in-law comes aggressively forward to assume the burden of conversation . Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Well , a more fatiguing drive I certainly never knew ! How do you do , Maggie ? " She kisses Miss Wallace in a casual , uninterested way , and takes Lilly 's hand . " Is n't this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know your family  --  your uncle George , before that dreadful business of his . I believe it all came out right ; he was n't to blame ; but it was a shocking experience . " Mrs. Murray turns from Lilly , and refers herself to the company in general : " It seems as if I should expire on the spot . I feel as if I had been packed away in my own hat-box for a week , and here , just as we arrive , the landlord informs us that he did n't expect us till to-morrow night , and he has n't an empty room in the house ! " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " No room ! To-morrow night ! What nonsense ! Why , it 's perfectly frantic ! How could he have misunderstood ? Why , it seems to me that I 've done nothing for a week past but tell him you were coming tonight ! " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray sharply .  --  " I have no doubt of it . But it does n't alter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave our things till after tea , Leslie . If they ca n't make up beds on the sofas and the piano , I do n't know where we 're going to pass the night . " In the moment of distressful sensation which follows , Miss Wallace whispers something eagerly to her friend , Miss Roberts . Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace with a laughing glance at Leslie and her mother , and then going on with her whispering .  --  " Excuse the little confidence ! " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Conspiracy , I 'm afraid . What are you plotting , Maggie ? " Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace finishing her confidence .  --  " Oh , we need n't make a mystery of such a little thing . We 're going to offer you one of our rooms . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " My dear , you are going to do nothing of the kind . We will never allow it . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Now , Mrs. Bellingham , you break my heart ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe we can make room for all three of you . " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray promptly .  --  " Let me go with you , young ladies . I 'm an old housekeeper , and I can help you plan . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Oh do , Mrs. Murray . You can tell which room you 'd better take , Lilly 's or mine . Lilly 's is "  --  Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Oh ! I had forgotten that we were detaining you ! " Mrs. Murray is about to leave the room with the two young girls , when her eye falls upon Blake , who is still present , with his burden of hand-bags and shawls . " Leave the things on the table , please . We are obliged to you . " Mrs. Murray speaks with a certain finality of manner and tone which there is no mistaking ; Blake stares at her a moment , and then , without replying , lays down the things and turns to quit the room ; at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's side , on the sofa , and sweeps towards him . Leslie , Leslie very graciously  --  " Do n't let our private afflictions drive you from a public room , Mr.  --  " Blake .  --  Blake " Blake . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Mr. Blake . This is my mother , Mr. Blake , who wishes to thank you for all your kindness to us . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Yes , indeed , Mr. Blake , we are truly grateful to you . " Leslie , Leslie with increasing significance .  --  " And my aunt , Mrs. Murray ; and my friend , Miss Wallace ; and Miss Roberts . " Blake bows to each of the ladies as they are named , but persists in his movement to quit the room ; Leslie impressively offers him her hand . " Must you go ? Thank you ever , ever so much ! " She follows him to the door in his withdrawal , and then turns and confronts her aunt with an embattled front of defiance . Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence .  --  " Come , Lilly . Let us go and take a look at our resources . We 'll be back in a moment , Mrs. Bellingham . ' IV . Mrs. Bellingham and Leslie ; afterwards Mrs. Murray and Maggie . Leslie , Leslie coming abruptly forward as her aunt goes out with the two young girls , and drooping meekly in front of her mother , who remains seated on the sofa .  --  " Well , mamma ! " Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham tranquilly contemplating her for a moment .  --  " Well , Leslie ! " She pauses , and again silently regards her daughter . " Perhaps you may be said to have overdone it . " Leslie , Leslie passionately .  --  - " I ca n't help it , mother ! I could n't see him sent away in that insolent manner , I do n't care who or what he is . Aunt Kate 's tone was outrageous , atrocious , hideous ! And after accepting , yes , demanding every service he could possibly render , the whole afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to stand it . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " If you mean by all that that your poor aunt is a very ungracious and exacting woman , I shall not dispute you . But she 's your father 's sister ; and she 's very much older than you . You seem to have forgotten , too , that your mother was present to do any justice that was needed . It 's very unfortunate that he should have been able to do us so many favours , but that ca n't be helped now . It 's one of the risks of coming to these out-of-the-way places , that you 're so apt to be thrown in with nondescript people that you do n't know how to get rid of afterwards . And now that he 's been so cordially introduced to us all ! Well , I hope you wo n't have to be crueller in the end , my dear , than your aunt meant to be in the beginning . So far , of course , he has behaved with perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even as a mere acquaintance he 's quite out of the question ; that however kind and thoughtful he 's been , and no one could have been more so , he is n't a gentleman . " Leslie , Leslie impatien tly.  --  " Well , then , mother , I am ! And so are you . And I think we are bound to behave like gentlemen at any cost . I did n't mean to ignore you . I did n't consider . I acted as I thought Charley would have done . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Oh , my dear , my dear ! Do n't you see there 's a very important difference ? Your brother is a man , and he can act without reference to consequences . But you are a young lady , and you ca n't be as gentlemanly as you like without being liable to misinterpretation . I shall expect you to behave very discreetly indeed from this time forth . We must consider now how our new friend can be kindly , yet firmly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's another of those embarrassments that aunt Kate 's always getting me into ! I was discreet about it till she acted so horridly . You can ask Maggie if I did n't talk in the wisest way about it ; like a perfect  --  owl . I saw it just as you do , mamma , and I was going to drop him , and so I will , yet ; but I could n't see him so ungratefully trampled on . It 's all her doing ! Who wanted to come here to this out-of-the-way place ? Why , aunt Kate ,  --  when I was eager to go to Conway ! I declare it 's too bad ! " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " That will do , Leslie . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " And now she 's gone off with those poor girls to crowd them out of house and home , I suppose . It 's a shame ! Why did you let her , mamma ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " For the same reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've bidden you stop . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , you dear , kind old mamma , you ! You 're a gentleman , and you always were ! I only wish I could be half like you ! " She throws her arms round her mother 's neck and kisses her . " I know you 're right about this matter , but you must n't expect me to acknowledge that aunt Kate is . If you both said exactly the same thing , you would be right and she would be wrong , you 'd say it so differently ! " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray who returns alone with signs of discontent and perplexity , and flings herself into a chair .  --  " Their rooms are mere coops , and I do n't see how even two of us are to squeeze into one of them . It 's little better than impertinence to offer it to us . I 've been down to see the landlord again , and you 'll be pleased to know , Marion , that the only vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom we 've all just had the honour of an introduction . " Leslie makes an impetuous movement , as if she were about to speak , but at a gesture from her mother she restrains herself , and Mrs. Murray continues : " Of course , if he had been a gentleman , in the lowest sense of the word , he would have offered his room to ladies who had none , at once . As long as he could make social capital out of his obtrusive services to us he was very profuse with them , but as soon as it came to a question of real self-sacrifice  --  to giving up his own ease and comfort for a single night "  --  A bell rings , and at the sound Mrs. Bellingham rises . Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " I suppose that 's for supper . I think a cup of tea will put a cheerfuller face on our affairs . I do n't at all agree with you about Mr. Blake 's obligation to give up his room , nor about his services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires us to acknowledge that he was everything that was kind and thoughtful . Oh , you good child ! "  --  as Miss Wallace appears at the door ,  --  " have you come to show us the way to supper ? Are you quite sure you 've not gone without tea on our account as well as given up your room ? " She puts her arm fondly round the young girl 's waist , and presses her cheek against her own breast . Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace with enthusiasm .  --  " Oh , Mrs. Bellingham , you know I would n't ask anything better than to starve on your account . I wish I had n't been to tea ! I 'm afraid that you 'll think the room is a very slight offering when you come to see it  --  it is such a little room ; why , when I took Mrs. Murray into it , it seemed all at once as if I saw it through the wrong end of an opera-glass  --  it did dwindle so ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , as it is . If your room was an inch bigger , we could n't bear it . I hope you may be without a roof over your head yourself , some day ! Can I say anything handsomer than that ? Do n't wait for me , mamma ; I 'll find the dining-room myself . I 'm rather too crumpled even for a houseless wanderer . " She opens her bag where it stands on the table . " I am going to make a flying toilet at one of these glasses . Do you think any one will come in , Maggie ? " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " There is n't the least danger . This is the parlour of the ' transients , ' as they call them ,  --  the occasional guests ,  --  and Lilly and I have it mostly to ourselves when there are no transients . The regular boarders stay in the lower parlour . Sha n't I help you , Leslie ? " Leslie , Leslie rummaging through her bag .  --  " No , indeed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do go with mamma ! " As Maggie obeys , Leslie finds her brush , and going to one of the mirrors touches the blonde masses of her hair , and then remains a moment , lightly turning her head from side to side to get the effect . She suddenly claps her hand to one ear . " Oh , horrors ! That ear-drop 's gone again ! " She runs to the table , re-opens her bag , and searches it in every part , talking rapidly to herself . " Well , really , it seems as if sorrows would never end ! To think of that working out a third time ! To think of my coming away without getting the clasp fixed ! And to think of my not leaving them in my trunk at the station ! Oh dear me , I shall certainly go wild ! What shall I do ? It is n't in the bag at all . It must be on the floor . " Keeping her hand in helpless incredulity upon the ear from which the jewel is missing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance of acute anguish . Footsteps are heard approaching the door , where they hesitatingly arrest themselves . " Have you come back for me ? Oh , I 've met with such a calamity ! I 've lost one of my earrings . I could cry . Do come and help me mouse for it . " There is no response to this invitation , and Leslie , lifting her eyes , in a little dismay confronts the silent intruder . " Mr. Blake ! " V. Leslie and Blake . Blake. -  --  Blake " Excuse me . I expected to find your mother here . I did n't mean to disturb " Leslie , Leslie haughtily. -  --  " There 's no disturbance . It 's a public room : I had forgotten that . Mamma has gone to tea . I thought it was my friend Miss Wallace . I "  --  With a flash of indignation : " When you knew it was n't , why did you let me speak to you in that way ? " Blake , Blake with a smile .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had n't time to prevent your speaking . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " You remained . " Blake , Blake with a touch of resentment tempering his amusement .  --  " I could n't go away after I had come without speaking to you . It was Mrs. Bellingham I was looking for . I 'm sorry not to find her , and I 'll go , now . " Leslie , Leslie hast ily.  --  " Oh no ! I beg your pardon . I did n't mean "  --  Blake , Blake advancing toward her , and stooping to pick up something from the floor , near the table .  --  " Is this what you lost ?  --  if I 've a right to know that you lost anything . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , my ear-ring ! Oh , thanks ! How did you see it ? I thought I had looked and felt everywhere . " A quick colour flies over her face as she takes the jewel from the palm of his hand . She turns to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear between the thumb and forefinger of one hand , hooks the pendant into place with the other , and then gives her head a little shake ; the young man lightly sighs . She turns toward him , with the warmth still lingering in her cheeks . " I 'm ever so much obliged to you , Mr. Blake . I wish I had your gift of doing all sorts of services  --  favours  --  to people . I wish I could find something for you . " Blake .  --  Blake " I wish you could  --  if it were the key to my room , which I came back in hopes of finding . I 've mislaid it somewhere , and I thought I might have put it down with your shawls here on the table . " Leslie promptly lifts one of the shawls , and the key drops from it . " That 's it . Miss Bellingham , I have a favour to ask : will you give this key to your mother ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " This key ? " Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep at a farm-house just down the road , and I want your mother to take my room ; I have n't looked into it yet , and I do n't know that it 's worth taking . But I suppose it 's better than no room at all ; and I know you have none . " Leslie , Leslie with cold hauteur , after looking absently at him for a moment .  --  " Thanks . It 's quite impossible . My mother would never consent . " Blake .  --  Blake " The room will stand empty , then . I meant to give it up from the first ,  --  as soon as I found that you were not provided for ,  --  but I hated to make a display of it before all the people down there in the office . I 'll go now and leave the key with the landlord , as I ought to have done , without troubling you . But  --  I had hardly the chance of doing so after we came here . " Leslie , Leslie with enthusiasm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to give us your room after you 've been so odiously  --  Oh , it 's too bad ; it 's too bad ! You must n't ; no , you shall not . " Blake .  --  Blake " I will leave the key on the table here . Good-night . Or  --  I shall not see you in the morning : perhaps I had better say good-bye . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Good-bye ? In the morning ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I 've changed my plans , and I 'm going away to-morrow . Good-bye . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Going  --  Mamma will be very sorry to  --  Oh , Mr. Blake , I hope you are not going because  --  But indeed  --  I want you to believe "  --  Blake , Blake devoutly. -  --  " I believe it . Goodbye ! " He turns away to go , and Leslie , standing bewildered and irresolute , lets him leave the room ; then she hastens to the door after him , and encounters her mother . VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Well , Leslie . Are you quite ready ? We went to look at Maggie 's room before going down to tea . It 's small , but we shall manage somehow . Come , dear . She 's waiting for us at the head of the stairs . Why , Leslie ! " Leslie , Leslie touching her handkerchief to her eyes .  --  " I was a little overwrought , mamma . I 'm tired . " After a moment : " Mamma , Mr. Blake "  --  Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham with a look at her daughter .  --  " I met him in the hall . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Yes , he has been here ; and I thought I had lost one of my ear-rings ; and of course he found it on the floor the instant he came in ; and "  --  Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray surging into the room , and going up to the table .  --  " Well , Marion , the tea  --  What key is this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie , Leslie with supreme disregard of her aunt , and adamantine self-control .  --  " Mr. Blake had come "  --  she hands the key to Mrs. Bellingham  --  " to offer you the key of his room . He asked me to give it . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " The key of his room ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " He offers you his room ; he had always meant to offer it . " Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham gravely .  --  " Mr. Blake had no right to know that we had no room . It is too great a kindness . We ca n't accept it , Leslie . I hope you told him so , my dear . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Yes , mamma . But he said he was going to lodge at one of the farm-houses in the neighbourhood , and the room would be vacant if you did n't take it . I could n't prevent his leaving the key . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " That is all very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we are concerned . It is very good of Mr. Blake , but after what has occurred , it 's simply impossible . We ca n't take it . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Occurred ? Not take it ? Of course we will take it , Marion ! I certainly am astonished . The man will get a much better bed at the farmer 's than he 's accustomed to . You talk as if it were some act of self-sacrifice . I 've no doubt he 's made the most of it . I 've no doubt he 's given it an effect of heroism  --  or tried to . But that you should fall in with his vulgar conception of the affair , Marion , and Leslie should be affected to tears by his magnanimity , is a little too comical . One would think , really , that he had imperilled life and limb on our account . All this sentiment about a room on the third floor ! Give the key to me , Marion . " She possesses herself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will wish to stay with you , so as to be near her young friends . I will occupy this vacant room . " II . " IN FAYRE FOREST . " I. Two Tramps . Under the shelter of some pines near a lonely by-road , in the neighbourhood of the Ponkwasset Hotel , lie two tramps asleep . One of them , having made his bed of the pine-boughs , has pillowed his head upon the bundle he carries by day ; the other is stretched , face downward , on the thick brown carpet of pine-needles . The sun , which strikes through the thin screen of the trees upon the bodies of the two men , is high in the heavens . The rattle of wheels is heard from time to time on the remoter highway ; the harsh clatter of a kingfisher , poising over the water , comes from the direction of the river near at hand . A squirrel descends the trunk of an oak near the pines under which the men lie , and at sight of them stops , barks harshly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , whisks back into the top of the oak . It is the luxurious tramp on the pine-boughs who stirs , and who alertly opens his eyes and sits up in his bed , as if the noisy rush of the squirrel had startled him from his sleep . First Tramp , First Tramp casting a malign glance at the top of the oak .  --  " If I had a fair shot at you with this club , my fine fellow , I 'd break you of that trick of waking people before the bell rings in the morning , and I 'd give ' em broiled squirrel for breakfast when they did get up . " He takes his bundle into his lap , and , tremulously untying it , reveals a motley heap of tatters ; from these he searches out a flask , which he holds against the light , shakes at his ear , and inverts upon his lips . " Not a drop ; not a square smell , even ! I dreamt it . " He lies down with a groan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reaches for his stick , and again rising to a sitting posture strikes his sleeping comrade across the shoulders . " Get up ! " Second Tramp , Second Tramp who speaks with a slight brogue , briskly springing to his feet , and rubbing his shoulders .  --  " And what for , my strange bedfellow ? " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " For breakfast . What do people generally get up for in the morning ? " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Upon my soul , I 'd as soon have had mine in bed ; I 've a day of leisure before me . And let me say a word to you , my friend : the next time you see a gentleman dreaming of one of the most elegant repasts in the world , and just waiting for his stew to cool , do n't you intrude upon him with that little stick of yours . I do n't care for a stroke or two in sport , but when I think of the meal I 've lost , I could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ugly brute . Have you got anything to eat there in your wardrobe ? " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " Not a crumb . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Or to drink ? " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " Not a drop . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Or to smoke ? " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " No . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Faith , you 're nearer a broken head than ever , me friend . Wake a man out of a dream of that sort ! " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " I 've had enough of this . What do you intend to do ? " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " I 'm going to assume the character of an impostor , and pretend at the next farm-house that I have n't had any breakfast , and have n't any money to buy one . It 's a bare-faced deceit , I know , but "  --  looking down at his broken shoes and tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part pretty well . To be sure , the women are not as ready to listen as they were once . The tramping-trade is overdone ; there 's too many in it ; the ladies ca n't believe we 're all destitute ; it do n't stand to reason . " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " I 'm tired of the whole thing . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " I do n't like it myself . But there 's worse things . There 's work , for example . By my soul , there 's nothing disgusts me like these places where they tell you to go out and hoe potatoes , and your breakfast will be ready in an hour . I never could work with any more pleasure on an empty stomach than a full one . And the poor devils always think they 've done something so fine when they say that , and the joke 's so stale ! I can tell them I 'm not to be got rid of so easy . I 'm not the lazy , dirty vagabond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the conflict between labour and capital ; I 'm the logical consequence of the prevailing corruption . I read it on the bit of newspaper they gave me round my dinner , yesterday ; it was cold beef of a quality that you do n't often find in the country . " First Tramp , First Tramp sullenly .  --  " I 'm sick of the whole thing . I 'm going out of it . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " And what 'll you do ? Are you going to work ? " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " To work ? No ! To steal . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Faith , I do n't call that going out of it , then . It 's quite in the line of business . You 're no bad dab at a hen-roost , now , as I know very well ; and for any little thing that a gentleman can shove under his coat , while the lady of the house has her back turned buttering his lunch for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " If I could get a man to tell me the time of day by a watch I liked , I 'd as lief knock him over as look at him . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Oh , if it 's highway robbery you mean , partner , I do n't follow you . " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " What 's the difference ? " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Not much , if you take it one way , but a good deal if you take it another . It 's the difference between petty larceny and grand larceny ; it 's the difference between three months in the House of Correction and ten years in the State 's Prison , if you 're caught , not to mention the risks of the profession . " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " I 'd take the risks if I saw my chance . " He lies down with his arms crossed under his head , and stares up into the pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly out from the shelter of the trees , and , shading his eyes with one hand , peers down the road . Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " I did n't know but I might see your chance , partner . You would n't like an old gentleman with a load of potatoes to begin on , would ye ? There 's one just gone up the cross-road . And yonder goes an umbrella-mender . I 'm afraid we sha n't take any purses to speak of , in this neighbourhood . Whoosh ! Wait a bit  --  here 's somebody coming this way . " The first tramp is sufficiently interested to sit up . " Faith , here 's your chance at last , then , if you 're in earnest , my friend ; but it stands six feet in its stockings , and it carries a stick as well as a watch . I wo n't ask a share of the plunder , partner ; I 've rags enough of my own without wanting to divide your property with the gentleman coming . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trees , while the other , who has risen from his pine-boughs , comes cautiously forward ; after a glance at the approaching wayfarer he flings away his cudgel , and , taking a pipe from his pocket , drops into a cringing attitude . The Irishman grins . In another moment Blake appears from under the cover of the woods and advances with long strides , striking with his stick at the stones in the road as he comes on , in an absent-minded fashion . II . Blake and the Tramps . First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " I say , mister ! " Blake looks up , and his eye falls upon the squalid figure of the tramp ; he stops . " Could n't you give a poor fellow a little tobacco for his pipe ? A smoke comes good , if you do n't happen to know where you 're going to get your breakfast . " Second Tramp , Second Tramp coming forward , with his pipe in his hand .  --  " True for you , partner . A little tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bush . " Blake looks from one to the other , and then takes a paper of tobacco from his pocket and gives it to the first tramp , who helps himself and passes it to his comrade ; the latter offers to return it after filling his pipe ; Blake declines it with a wave of his hand , and walks on . Second Tramp , Second Tramp calling after him .  --  " God bless you ! May you never want it ! " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " Thank you , mister . You 're a gentleman ! " Blake .  --  Blake " All right . " He goes out of sight under the trees down the road , and then suddenly reappears and walks up to the two tramps , who remain where he left them and are feeling in their pockets for a match . " Did one of you call me a gentleman ! " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " Yes , I did , mister . No offence in that , I hope ? " Blake .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " Well , you did n't ask us why we did n't go to work ; and you did n't say that men who had n't any money to buy breakfast had better not smoke ; and you gave us this tobacco . I 'll call any man a gentleman that 'll do that . " Blake .  --  Blake " Oh , that 's a gentleman , is it ? All right . " He turns to go away , when the second tramp detains him . Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Does your honour happen to have ever a match about you ? " Blake takes out his match-case and strikes a light . " God bless your honour . You 're a real gentleman . " Blake .  --  Blake " Then this makes me a gentleman past a doubt ! " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Sure , it does that . " Blake .  --  Blake " I 'm glad to have the matter settled . " He walks on absently as before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he has gone . Second Tramp , Second Tramp who goes back to the tree where he has been sitting and stretches himself out with his head on one arm for a quiet smoke .  --  " That 's a queer genius . By my soul , I 'd like to take the road in his company . Sure , I think there is n't the woman alive would be out of cold victuals and old clothes when he put that handsome face of his in at the kitchen window . " First Tramp , First Tramp looking down the road .  --  " I wonder if that fellow could have a drop of spirits about him ! I say , mister ! " calling after Blake . " Hello , there , I say ! " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " It 's too late , my worthy friend . He 'll never hear you ; and it 's not likely he 'd come back to fill your flask for you , if he did . A gentleman of his character 'd think twice before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He takes out the half-paper of tobacco , and looks at the label on it . " What an extravagant dog ! It 's the real cut-cavendish ; and it smells as nice as it smokes . This luxury is what 's destroying the country . ' With the present reckless expenditure in all classes of the population , and the prodigious influx of ignorant and degraded foreigners , there must be a constant increase of tramps . ' True for you , Mr. Newspaper . ' T would have been an act of benevolence to take his watch from him , partner , and he never could tell how fast he was going to ruin . But you ca n't always befriend a man six feet high and wiry as a cat . " He offers to put the tobacco into his pocket again , when his comrade slouches up , and makes a clutch at it . First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " I want that . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Why , so ye do ! " First Tramp .  --  First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Second Tramp " I 'm keeping it for ye . " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " I tell you the man gave it to me . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " And he would n't take it back from me . Ah , will you , ye brute ? " The other seizes the wrist of the hand with which the Irishman holds the tobacco ; they wrestle together , when women 's voices are heard at some distance down the road . " Whoosh ! Ladies coming . " The first tramp listens , kneeling . The Irishman springs to his feet and thrusts the paper of tobacco into his pocket , and , coming quickly forward , looks down the road . " Fortune favours the brave , partner ! Here comes another opportunity  --  three of them , faith , and pretty ones at that ! Business before pleasure ; I 'll put off that beating again ; it 's all the better for keeping . Besides , it 's not the thing , quarrelling before ladies . " He is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before , when his comrade hastily gathers up his bundle , and seizing him by the arm drags him back into the thicket behind the pine-trees . After a moment or two , three young ladies come sauntering slowly along the road . III . Leslie , Maggie , and Lilly ; then Leslie alone . Lilly , Miss Lilly Roberts delicately sniffing the air .  --  " Fee , fi , fo , fum ; I smell the pipe of an Irishman . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Never ! I know the flavour of refined tobacco , thanks to a smoking brother . Oh , what a lonely road ! " Lilly .  --  Miss Lilly Roberts " This loneliness is one of the charms of the Ponkwasset neighbourhood . When you 're once out of sight of the hotel and the picnic-grounds you 'd think you were a thousand miles away from civilisation . Not an empty sardine-box or a torn paper collar anywhere ! This scent of tobacco is an unheard-of intrusion . " Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace archly.  --  " Perhaps Mr. Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leslie , Leslie coldly .  --  " How should I know , Maggie ? A gentleman would hardly smoke in ladies ' company  --  strange ladies . " She sinks down upon a log at the wayside , and gazes slowly about with an air of fastidious criticism that gradually changes to a rapture of admiration . " Well , I certainly think that , take it all in all , I never saw anything more fascinating . It 's wonderful ! This little nook itself , with that brown carpet of needles under the pines , and that heavy fringe of ferns there , behind those trunks ; and then those ghostly birches stretching up and away , yonder  --  thousands of them ! How tall and slim and stylish they are ! And how they do march into the distance ! I never saw such multitudes ; and their lovely paleness makes them look as if one saw them by moonlight . Oh , oh ! How perfectly divine ! If one could only have their phantom-like procession painted ! But Corot himself could n't paint them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have the presumption to call it a sketch . " She takes a sketch-book from under her arm , and lays it on her knees , and then with her never shall see them so beautiful again ! Just jot down a few lines , and wash in the background when I get to the hotel . But girls ; you must n't stay ! Go on and get the flowers , and I 'll be done by the time you 're back . I could n't bear to have you overlooking me ; I 've all the sensitiveness of a great artist . Do go ! But do n't be gone long . " She begins to work at her sketch , without looking at them . Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " I 'm so glad , Leslie . I knew you 'd be perfectly fascinated with this spot , and so I did n't tell you about it . I wanted it to burst upon you . " Leslie , Leslie with a little impatient surprise , as if she had thought they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You did quite right . Do n't stay long . " She continues to sketch , looking up now and then at the scene before her ; but not glancing at her companions , who walk away from her some paces , when Miss Wallace comes back . Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " What time is it , Leslie ? Leslie ! " Leslie , Leslie nervously. -  --  " Oh ! What a start you gave me . " Glancing at her watch : " It 's nine minutes past ten  --  I mean ten minutes past nine . " Still without looking at her : " Be back soon . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Oh , it is n't far . " Again she turns away with Miss Roberts , but before they are quite out of sight Leslie springs to her feet and runs after them . Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , girls  --  girls ! " Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace anxiously , starting back toward her .  --  " What ? What ? " Leslie , Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down .  --  " Oh , nothing . I just happened to think . " She closes her eyes to a narrow line , and looks up at the birches . " There are so many horrid stories in the papers . But of course there ca n't be any in this out-of-the-way place , so far from the cities . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Any what , Leslie ? " Leslie , Leslie remotely .  --  - " Tramps . " Maggie , Miss Maggie Wallace scornfully.  --  " There never was such a thing heard of in the whole region . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I thought not . " She is again absorbed in study of the birches ; and , after a moment of hesitation , the other two retreat down the road once more , lingering a little to look back in admiration of her picturesque devotion to art , and then vanishing under the flickering light and shadow . Leslie works diligently on , humming softly to herself , and pausing now and then to look at the birches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gracefully bending from side to side , or stooping forward to make sure of some effect that she has too slightly glimpsed , resumes her seat and begins anew . " No , that wo n't do ! "  --  vigorously plying her india-rubber on certain lines of the sketch . " How stupid ! " Then beginning to draw again , and throwing back her head for the desired distance on her sketch : " Ah , that 's more like . Still , nobody could accuse it of slavish fidelity . Well ! " She sings :  --  " Through starry palm-roofs on Old Nile The full-orbed moon looked clear ; The bulbul sang to the crocodile , ' Ah , why that bitter tear ? ' " With thy tender breast against the thorn , ' Why that society-smile ? ' The bird was mute . In silent scorn Slow winked the crocodile . " " How perfectly ridiculous ! Slow winked . "  --  Miss Bellingham alternately applies pencil and rubber  --  " slow winked the croco  --  I never shall get that right ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to sketch , and sing da capo , the tramps creep stealthily from their covert . Apparently in accordance with some preconcerted plan , the surlier and huger ruffian goes down the road in the direction taken by Leslie 's friends , and the Irishman stations himself unobserved at her side and supports himself with both hands resting upon the top of his stick , in an attitude of deferential patience and insinuating gallantry . She ceases singing and looks up . IV . The Young Girls and the Tramps . Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Not to be interrupting you , miss , "  --  Leslie stares at his grinning face in dumb and motionless horror ,  --  " would ye tell a poor traveller the time of day , so that he need n't be eating his breakfast prematurely , if he happens to get any ? " First Tramp , First Tramp from his station down the road , in a hoarse undertone.  --  " Snatch it out of her belt , you fool ! Snatch it ! He 's coming back . Quick ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Tramp " Ye see , miss , my friend 's impatient . " Soothingly : " Just let me examine your watch . I give ye my honour I wo n't hurt you ; do n't lose your presence of mind , my dear ; do n't be frightened . " As she shrinks back , he clutches at her watch-chain . Leslie , Leslie in terror-stricken simplicity ,  --  " Oh , oh , no ! Do n't ! Do n't take my watch . My father gave it to me  --  and he 's dead . " Second Tramp .  --  Second Tramp " Then he 'll never miss it , my dear . Do n't oblige me to be rude to a lady . Give it here , at once , that 's a dear . " First Tramp .  --  First Tramp " Hurry , hurry ! He 's coming ! " As the Irishman seizes her by the wrist , Leslie utters one wild shriek after another , to which the other young girls respond , as they reappear under the trees down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie ! What is it ? " Lilly , Miss Lilly Roberts at sight of Leslie struggling with the tramp .  --  " Oh , help , help , help , somebody  --  do ! " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Murder ! " First Tramp , First Tramp rushing past them to the aid of his fellow .  --  " Clap your hand over her mouth ! Stop her noise , somehow ! Choke her ! " He springs forward , and while the Irishman stifles her cries with his hands , the other tears the watch-chain loose from its fastening . They suddenly release her , and as she reels gasping and swooning away , some one has the larger villain by the throat , who struggles with his assailant backward into the undergrowth , whence the crash of broken branches , with cries and curses , makes itself heard . Following this tumult comes the noise of a rush through the ferns , and then rapid footfalls , as of flight and pursuit on the hard road , that die away in the distance , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from her incoherent moans and laments what has happened . Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Leslie , Leslie , Leslie , what was it ? Do try to think ! Do try to tell ! Oh , I shall go wild if you do n't tell what 's the matter . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , it was  --  Oh , oh , I feel as if I should never be clean again ! How can I endure it ? That filthy hand on my mouth ! Their loathsome rags , their sickening faces ! Ugh ! Oh , I shall dream of it as long as I live ! Why , why did I ever come to this horrid place ? " Maggie ,  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Leslie ,  --  dear , good Leslie ,  --  what was it all ? " Leslie , Leslie panting and sobbing .  --  " Oh , two horrid , disgusting men ! Do n't ask me ! And they told me to give them my watch , and I begged them not to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he kept running all round me ; and oh , dear ! the other was worse than he was ; yes , worse ! And he told him  --  oh , girls !  --  to choke me ! And he came running up , and then the other put one of his hands over my mouth , and I could n't breathe ; and I thought I should die ; but I was n't going to let the wretches have my watch , if I could help it ; and I kept struggling ; and all at once they ran away , and "  --  putting her hand to her belt  --  " Oh , it 's gone , it 's gone , it 's gone ! Oh , papa , papa ! The watch you gave me is gone ! " She crouches down upon the log , and leaning her head upon her hands against the trunk of a tree gives way to her tears and sobs , while the others kneel beside her in helpless distress . On this scene Blake emerges from the road down which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he advances with his right arm held behind him , while the left clasps something which he extends as he speaks . V. Blake and the Young Girls . Blake , Bl ake after a pause in which he stands looking at Leslie , unheeded by the others .  --  " Here is your watch , Miss Bellingham . " Leslie , Leslie whirling swiftly round to her feet .  --  " My watch ? Oh , where did you find it ? " She springs towards him and joyfully seizing it from his hand scans it eagerly , and then kisses it in a rapture . " Safe , safe , safe ! Not hurt the least ! My precious gift ! Oh , how glad I am ! It 's even going yet ! How did you get it ? Where did you get it ? " Blake , Blake who speaks with a certain painful effort while he moves slowly away backward from her .  --  " I found it  --  I got it from the thief . " Leslie , Leslie looking confusedly at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Oh , it was you , Mr. Blake , who came flying past us , and drove them away ! Did you have to fight them ? Oh , did they hurt you ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " It was you  --  Why , how pale you look ! There 's blood on your face ! Why , where were you ? How did it all happen ? It was you that drove them away ? You ? And I never thought of you ! And I only thought about myself  --  my watch ! I never can forgive myself . " She lets fall the watch from her heedless grasp , and he mechanically puts out the hand which he has been keeping behind him ; she impetuously seizes it in her own and , suddenly shrinking , he subdues the groan that breaks from him to a sort of gasp , and totters to the log where Leslie has been sitting . Lilly .  --  Miss Lilly Roberts " Oh , see , Miss Bellingham ; they 've broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's nothing ; do n't  --  do n't "  --  Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Oh dear , he 's going to faint ! What shall we do if he does ? I did n't know they ever fainted ! " She wrings her hands in despair , while Leslie flings herself upon her knees at Blake 's side . " Ought n't we to support him , somehow ? Oh yes , do let 's support him , all of us ! " Leslie , Leslie imperiously.  --  " Run down to the river as fast as ever you can , and wet your handkerchiefs to sprinkle his face with . " She passes her arm round Blake 's , and tenderly gathers his broken wrist into her right hand . " One can support him . " III . A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING . I. Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Bellingham . Three weeks after the events last represented Mrs. Bellingham and her sister-in-law are once more seated in the hotel parlour , both with sewing , to which the latter abandons herself with an apparently exasperated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap , and listens with some lady-like trepidation to what Mrs. Murray is saying . Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " From beginning to end it has been quite like a sensation play . Leslie must feel herself a heroine of melodrama . She is sojourning at a country inn , and she goes sketching in the woods , when two ruffians set upon her and try to rob her . Her screams reach the ear of the young man of humble life but noble heart , who professed to have gone away , but who was still opportunely hanging about ; he rushes on the scene and disperses the brigands , from whom he rends their prey . She seizes his hand to thank him for his sublime behaviour , and discovers that his wrist has been broken by a blow from the bludgeon of one of the wicked ruffians . Very pretty , very charming , indeed ; and so appropriate for a girl of Leslie 's training , family , and station in life . Upon my word I congratulate you , Marion . To think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate that you let her snub Mr. Dudley . If she had married him , probably nothing of this kind would have happened . " Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham uneasily .  --  " I ought to be glad the affair amuses you , but I do n't see how even you can hold the child responsible for what has happened . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Responsible ! I should be the last to do that , I hope . No , indeed . I consider her the victim of circumstances , and since the hero has been thrown back upon our hands , I 'm sure every one must say that her devotion is most exemplary . I do n't hold her responsible for that , even . " As Mrs. Murray continues , Mrs. Bellingham 's uneasiness increases , and she drops her hands with a baffled look upon the work in her lap . " It 's quite en rgle that she should be anxious about him ; it would be altogether out of character , otherwise . It 's a pity that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I saw her bringing him a pillow , that first day , after the doctor set his wrist and she had got him to repose his exhausted frame on the sofa , I was almost melted to tears . Of course it can end only in one way . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Kate , I will not have any more of this . It 's intolerable , and you have no right to torment me so . You know that I 'm as much vexed as you can be . It annoys me beyond endurance , but I do n't see what , as a lady , I can do about it . Mr. Blake is here again by no fault of his own , certainly , and neither Leslie nor I can treat him with indifference . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " I do n't object to your treating him as kindly as you like , but you had better leave as little kindness as possible to Leslie . You must sooner or later recognise one thing , Marion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sooner . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " What do you mean ? " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " I mean what you know well enough : that Leslie is interested in this Mr. Blake . I saw that she was , from the very first moment . He 's just the kind of man to fascinate a girl like Leslie ; you know that . He 's handsome , and he 's shown himself brave ; and all that unconventionality which marks him of a different class gives him a charm to a girl 's fancy , even when she has recognised , herself , that he is n't a gentleman . She soon forgets that , and sees merely that he is clever and good . She would very promptly teach a girl of his traditions her place , but a young man is different . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " I hope Leslie would treat even a woman with consideration . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Oh , consideration , consideration ! You may thank yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the worst . You belong to one order of things or you belong to another . If you believe that several generations of wealth , breeding , and station distinguish a girl so that a new man , however good or wise he is , can never be her equal , you must act on your belief , and in a case like this you ca n't act too promptly . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " What should you do ? " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Do ? I should fling away all absurd ideas of consideration , to begin with . I should deal frankly with Leslie ; I should appeal to her pride and her common sense ; and I should speak so distinctly to this young man that he could n't possibly mistake my meaning . I should tell him  --  I should advise him to try change of air for his wound ; or whatever it is .

" Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Do you wish me to speak to him ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " No , I ca n't permit that , either . Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Very well ; then you must abide by the result " Mrs. Murray clutches her work together , stooping to recover dropping spools and scissors with an activity surprising in a lady of her massive person , and is about to leave the room , when the sound of steps and voices arrests her ; a moment after Miss Bellingham and Blake , with his right arm in a sling , enter the room , so intent upon each other as not to observe the ladies in the corner . II . Leslie and Blake ; Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Bellingham apart . Leslie .  --  Leslie " I 'm afraid you 've let me tire you . I 'm such an insatiable walker , and I never thought of your not being perfectly strong , yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellingham , it is n't one of my ankles that 's broken . " Leslie , Leslie concessivel y.  --  " No ; but if you 'd only let me do something for you . I can both play and sing , and really not at all badly . Shall I play to you ? " She goes up and strikes some chords on the piano , and with her hand on the keys glances with mock gravity round at Blake , who remains undecided . She turns about . " Perhaps you 'd rather have me read to you ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Do you really wish me to choose ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I do . And ask something difficult and disagreeable . " Blake .  --  Blake " I 'd rather have you talk to me than either . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Is that your idea of something difficult and disagreeable ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I hope you wo n't find it so . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " But I sha n't feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you here ? Or where ? " Blake .  --  Blake " This is a good place , but if I 'm to choose again , I should say the gallery would be better . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , you 're choosing that because I said I wondered how people could come into the country and sit all their time in stuffy rooms ! " Blake , Blake going to the window and looking out .  --  " There are no seats . " He returns , and putting the backs of two chairs together , lifts them with his left hand to carry them to the gallery . Leslie , Leslie advancing tragically upon him and reproachfully possessing herself of the chairs .  --  " Never ! Do you think I have no sense of shame ? " She lifts a chair in either hand and carries them out , while Blake in a charmed embarrassment follows her , and they are heard speaking without : " There ! Or no ! That 's in a draught . You must n't sit in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hurt me . I 'm not a young lady . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " That 's the very reason it will hurt you . If you were a young lady you could stand anything . Anything you liked . " There are indistinct murmurs of further feigned dispute , broken by more or less conscious laughter , to which Mrs. Bellingham listens with alarm and Mrs. Murray with the self-righteousness of those who have told you so , and who , having thus washed their hands of an affair , propose to give you a shower-bath of the water . Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Well , Marion ? " Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham rising , with a heavy sigh .  --  " Yes , it 's quite as bad as you could wish . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " As bad as I could wish ? This is too much , Marion . What are you going to do ? " Mrs. Bellingham is gathering up her work as if to quit the room , and Mrs. Murray 's demand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " We ca n't remain to overhear their talk . I am going to my room . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Why , Marion , the child is your own daughter ! " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " That is the very reason why I do n't wish to feel that she has cause to be ashamed of me ; and I certainly should if I stayed to eavesdrop . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " How in the world should she ever know it ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " I should tell her . But that is n't the point , quite . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " This is fantastic ! Well , let her marry her  --  Caliban ! Why do n't you go out and join them ? That need n't give her cause to blush for you .

I wish to know only what she will freely tell me . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " And are you actually going ? Well , Marion , I suppose I must n't say what I think of you . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " It is n't necessary that you should . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " If I were to speak , I should say that your logic was worthy of Bedlam , and your morality of  --  of  --  the millennium ! " She whirls furiously out of the parlour , and Mrs. Bellingham , with a lingering glance at the door opening upon the balcony , follows her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie comes to the gallery door and looks exploringly into the parlour . III . Leslie and Blake ; finally , Mrs. Bellingham . Leslie , Leslie speaking to Blake without .  --  " I was sure I heard voices . But there 's nobody . " She turns , and glancing at the hills which show their irregular mass through the open window , sinks down into a chair beside the low gallery rail . " Ah , this is a better point still , " and as Blake appears with his chair and plants it vis -- vis with her : " Why old Ponkwasset , I wonder ? But people always say old of mountains : old Wachusett , old Agamenticus , old Monadnock , old Ponkwasset . Perhaps the young mountains have gone West and settled down on the prairies , with all the other young people of the neighbourhood . Would n't that explain it ? " She looks with openly-feigned seriousness at Blake , who supports in his left hand the elbow of his hurt arm . " I 'm sure it 's paining you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least . The fact is "  --  he laughs lightly  --  " I 'm afraid I was n't thinking about the mountains just now , when you spoke . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , well , neither was I  --  very much . " They both laugh . " But why do you put your hand under your arm , if it does n't pain you ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Oh !  --  I happened to think of the scamp who broke it for me . " Leslie , Leslie shuddering.  --  " Do n't speak of it ! Or yes , do ! Tell me about it ; I 've wanted to ask you . I ought to know about it ; I hoped you would tell without asking . I can never be thankful enough that your walk happened to bring you back the same way . Why must you leave me to imagine all the rest ! " Blake .  --  Blake " Oh , those things are better imagined than described , Miss Bellingham . " Leslie .  --  Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , no matter how terrible it is . " Blake .  --  Blake " It was n't terrible ; there was very little of it , one way or the other . The big fellow would n't give up your watch ; and I had to  --  urge him ; and the little Irishman came dancing up , and made a pass at us with his stick , and my wrist caught it . That 's all . " Leslie , Leslie with effusion.  --  " All ? You risked your life to get me back my watch , and I asked about that first , and never mentioned you . " Blake .  --  Blake " I had n't done anything worth mentioning . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Then getting my watch was n't worth mentioning ! " Blake .  --  Blake " Where is it ? I have n't seen you wear it . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I broke something in it when I threw it down . It does n't go . Besides , I thought perhaps you would n't like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , I should . " Leslie , Leslie starting up .  --  " I 'll go get it . " Blake .  --  Blake " Not now ! " They are both silent . Leslie falters and then sits down again , and folds one hand over the other on the balcony rail , letting her fan dangle idly by its chain from her waist . He leans forward a little , and taking the fan , opens and shuts it , while she looks down upon him with a slight smile ; he relinquishes it with a glance at her , and leans back again in his chair . Leslie .  --  Leslie " Well , what were you thinking about that hideous little wretch who hurt you ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Why , I was thinking , for one thing , that he did n't mean to do it . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh ! Why did he do it , then ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I believe he meant to hit his partner , though I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I was thinking that a good deal might be said for tramps . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " For tramps that steal watches and break wrists ? My philanthropy does n't rise to those giddy heights , quite . No , decidedly , Mr. Blake , I draw the line at tramps . They never look clean , and why do n't they go to work ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Well , they could n't find work just now , if they wanted it , and generally I suppose they do n't want it . A man who 's been out of work three months is glad to get it , but if he 's idle a year he does n't want it . When I see one of your big cotton mills standing idle , I know that it means just so much tramping , so much starving and stealing , so much misery and murder . We 're all part of the tangle ; we 're all of us to blame , we 're none of us to blame . " Leslie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you pity such wretches , what becomes of the deserving poor ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I 'm not sure there are any deserving poor , as you call them , any more than there are deserving rich . So I do n't draw the line at tramps . The fact is , Miss Bellingham , I had just been doing those fellows a charity before they attacked you ,  --  given them some tobacco . You do n't approve of that ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , I like smoking ! " Blake , Blake laughing .  --  " And I got their idea of a gentleman . " Leslie , Leslie after a moment .  --  " Yes ? What was that ? " Blake .  --  Blake " A man who gives you tobacco , and does n't ask you why you do n't go to work . A real gentleman has matches about him to light your pipe with afterwards . Is that your notion of a gentleman ? " Leslie , Leslie consciou sly .  --  " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake " It made me think of the notion of a gentleman I once heard from a very nice fellow years ago : he believed that you could n't be a gentleman unless you began with your grandfather . I was younger then , and I remember shivering over it , for it left me quite out in the cold , though I could n't help liking the man ; he was a gentleman in spite of what he said ,  --  a splendid fellow , if you made allowance for him . You have to make allowances for everybody , especially for men who have had all the advantages . It 's apt to put them wrong for life ; they get to thinking that the start is the race . I used to look down on that sort of men , once  --  in theory . But what I saw of them in the war taught me better ; they only wanted an emergency , and they could show themselves as good as anybody . It is n't safe to judge people by their circumstances ; besides , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never came to anything . Still I prefer the tramp 's idea  --  perhaps because it 's more flattering  --  that you are a gentleman if you choose to be so . What do you think ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I do n't know . " After an interval long enough to vanquish and banish a disagreeable consciousness : " I think it 's a very unpleasant subject . Why do n't you talk of something else ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Oh , I was n't to talk at all , as I understood . I was to be talked to . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Well , what shall I talk to you about ? You must choose that , too . " Blake .  --  Blake " Let us talk about yourself , then . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " There is nothing about me . I 'm just like every other girl . Get Miss Wallace to tell you about herself , some day , and then you 'll know my whole history . I 've done everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , singing , piano , French , German , and Italian lessons ; we went to the same schools and the same lectures ; we have both been abroad , and can sketch , and paint on tiles . We 're as nearly alike as the same experiences and associations could make us , and we 're just like all the other girls we know . Is n't it rather monotonous ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I do n't know all the other girls that you know . If I can judge from Miss Wallace , I do n't believe you 're like them ; but they may be like you . " Leslie , Leslie laughing .  --  " That 's too fine a distinction for me . And you have n't answered my question . " Blake , Blake gravely .  --  " No , it is n't monotonous to me ; it 's all very good , I think . I 'm rather old-fashioned about women ; I like everything in their lives to be regular and ordered by old usage . " Leslie .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blake .  --  Blake " I do n't like eccentricity . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , I do . I should like to do all sorts of odd things , if I dared . " Blake .  --  Blake " Well , your not daring is a great point . If I had a sister , I should want her to be like all the other girls that are like you . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " You compliment ! She could n't be like me . " Blake .  --  Blake " Why ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Why ? Oh , I do n't know . " She hesitates , and then with a quick glance at him : " She would have dark eyes and hair , for one thing . " They both laugh . Blake .  --  Blake " Was that what you meant to say ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Is n't it enough to say what you mean , without being obliged to say what you meant ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be choosers . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , if you put it so meekly as that , you humiliate me . I must tell you now : I meant a question . " Blake .  --  Blake " What is it ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " But I ca n't ask it yet . Not till I 've got rid of some part of my obligations . " Blake .  --  Blake " I suppose you mean what I  --  what happened . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Yes . " Blake .  --  Blake " I 'm sorry that it happened , then ; and I had been feeling rather glad of it on the whole . I shall hate it if it 's an annoyance to you . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh ,  --  not annoyance , exactly . " Blake .  --  Blake " What then ? Should you like a receipt in full for all gratitude due me ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I should like to feel that we had done something for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cancel it all by giving me leave to enjoy being just what and where I am . " Leslie , Leslie demurely , after a little pause .  --  " Is a broken wrist such a pleasure , then ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I take the broken wrist for what it brings . If it were not for that , I should be in New York breaking my heart over some people I 'm connected with in business there , and wondering how to push a little invention of mine without their help . Instead of that "  --  Leslie , Leslie hastily .  --  " Oh ! Invention ? Are you an inventor , too , Mr. Blake ? Do tell me what it is . " Blake .  --  Blake " It 's an improved locomotive driving-wheel . But you 'd better let me alone about that , Miss Bellingham ; I never stop when I get on my driving-wheel . That 's what makes my friends doubtful about it ; they do n't see how any brake can check it . They say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without the slightest effect . You see I am rather sanguine about it . " He laughs nervously . Leslie .  --  Leslie " But what have those New York people to do with it ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Nothing at present . That 's the worst of it . They were partners of mine , and they got me to come on all the way from Omaha , and then I found out that they had no means to get the thing going . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh ! How could they do it ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Well , I used language to that effect myself , but they did n't seem to know ; and I ran up here to cool off and think the matter over for a fresh start . You see , if I succeed it will be an everlasting fortune to me ; and if I fail ,  --  well , it will be an everlasting misfortune . But I 'm not going to fail . There ; I 'm started ! If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stop me . I suppose you 're not much used to talking about driving-wheels , Miss Bellingham ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " We do n't often speak of them . But they must be very interesting to those that understand them . " Blake .  --  Blake " I ca n't honestly say they are . They 're like railroads ; they 're good to get you there . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Where ? " Blake .  --  Blake " Well , in my case , away from a good deal of drudgery I do n't like , and a life I do n't altogether fancy , and a kind of world I know too well . I should go to Europe , I suppose , if the wheel succeeded . I 've a curiosity to see what the apple is like on the other side ; whether it 's riper or only rottener . And I always believed I should quiet down somewhere , and read all the books I wanted to , and make up for lost time in several ways . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine for a year . " Leslie , Leslie earnestly .  --  " And would all that happen if you had the money to get the driving-wheel going ? " Blake , Blake with a smile at her earnestness .  --  " I 'm not such a driving-wheel fanatic as that . The thing has to be fully tested , and even after it 's tested , the roads may refuse to take hold of it . " Leslie , Leslie confidently .  --  " They ca n't  --  when they see that it 's better . " Blake .  --  Blake " I wish I could think so . But roads are human , Miss Bellingham . They prefer a thing that 's just as well to something that 's much better  --  if it costs much to change . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Well , then , if you do n't believe the roads will take hold of it , why do you want to test it ? Why do n't you give it up at once ? " Blake .  --  Blake " It wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , and I ca n't stop where I am with it , I must go on . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Yes . I should do just the same . I should never , never give it up . I know you 'll be helped . Mr. Blake , if this wheel "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " Really , Miss Bellingham , I feel ashamed for letting you bother yourself so long with that ridiculous wheel . But you would n't stick to the subject : we were talking about you . " Leslie , Leslie dreamily .  --  " About me ? " Then abruptly : " Mamma will wonder what in the world has become of me . " She rises , and Blake , with an air of slight surprise , follows her example . She leads the way . into the parlour , and lingeringly drawing near the piano , she strikes some chords , and as she stands over the instrument , she carelessly plays an air with one hand . Then , without looking up : " Was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Blake joyfully .  --  - " Oh yes , that 's it ; that 's it , at last ! " Leslie , Leslie seating herself at the piano and running over the keys again .  --  " I think I can play it for you ; it 's rather old-fashioned now . " She plays and sings , and then rests with her hands on the keys , looking up at Blake where he stands leaning one elbow on the corner of the piano . Blake .  --  Blake " I 'm very much obliged . " Leslie , Leslie laughing. -  --  " And I 'm very much surprised . " Blake .  --  Blake " Why ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I should think the inventor of a driving-wheel would want something a great deal more stirring than this German sentimentality and those languid , melancholy things from Tennyson that you liked . " Blake .  --  Blake " Ah , that 's just what I do n't want . I 've got stir enough of my own . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Blake " Am I such a puzzle ? I always thought myself a very simple affair . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " That 's the difficulty . I wish "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " What ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " That I could say something wrong in just the right way ! " Blake , Blake laughing .  --  " How do you know it 's wrong ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " It is n't , if you do n't think so . " Blake .  --  Blake " I do n't , so far . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Ah , do n't joke . It 's a very serious matter . " Blake .  --  Blake " Why should I think it was wrong ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I do n't know that you will . Mr. Blake "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " Well ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Did you know  --  If I begin to say something , and feel like stopping before I 've said it , you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very seriously . Blake , Blake with a smile of joyous amusement , looking down at her as he lounges at the corner of the piano .  --  " I wo n't even ask you to begin . " Leslie passes her hand over the edges of the keys , without making them sound ; then she drops it into her lap and there clasps it with the other hand , and looks up at Blake . Leslie .  --  Leslie " Did you know I was rich , Mr. Blake ? " Blake .  --  Blake " No , Miss Bellingham , I did n't . " His smile changes from amusement to surprise , and he colours faintly . Leslie , Leslie blushing violently .  --  " Well , I am ,  --  if being rich is having a great deal more money to do what you please than you know what to do with . " Blake listens with a look of deepening mystification ; she hurries desperately on : " I have this money in my own right ; it 's what my uncle left me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She pauses again , as if waiting for Blake to ask her to go on , but he remains loyally silent ; his smile has died away , and an embarrassment increases upon both of them . She looks up at him again , and implores : " What will you think of what I 'm going to say ? " Blake , Blake breaking into a troubled laugh .  --  " I ca n't imagine what you 're going to say . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Do n't laugh ! I know you wo n't  --  Oh , Mr. Blake , you said you liked girls to be just like everybody else , and old-established , and that ; and I know this is as eccentric as it can be . It is n't at all the thing , I know , for a young lady to say to a gentleman ; but you 're not like the others , and  --  Oh , it does n't seem possible that I should have begun it ! It seems perfectly monstrous ! But I know you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the bluntest and straightforwardest way will be the best way . " She keeps wistfully scanning Blake 's face as she speaks , but apparently gathers no courage or comfort from it . " Mr. Blake ! " Blake , Blake passively .  --  " Well ? " Leslie , Leslie with desperate vehemence .  --  " I want  --  Oh , what will you think of me ! But no , you 're too good yourself not to see it in just the right way . I 'm sure that you wo n't think it  --  unladylike  --  for me to propose such a thing , merely because  --  because most people would n't do it ; but I shall respect your reasons  --  I shall know you 're right  --  even if you refuse me ; and  --  Oh , Mr. Blake , I want to go into partnership with you ! " Blake , Blake recoiling a pace or two from the corner of the piano , as Leslie rises from the stool and stands confronting him : " To  --  to  --  go into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how dreadfully you take it ; and you promised  --  Oh , I knew you would n't like it !

I 'm sure I believe in it ; and "  --  She has followed him the pace or two of his withdrawal ; but now , at some changing expression of his face , she hesitates , falters , and remains silent and motionless , as if fixed and stricken mute by the sight of some hideous apparition . Then with a wild incredulity : " Oh ! " and indignation , " Oh ! " and passionate reproach and disappointment , " Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She drops her face into her hands , and sinks upon the piano-stool , throwing her burdened arms upon the keys with a melodious crash .

" Good heavens , I did n't  --  It was all "  --  Leslie , Leslie springing erect .  --  " Do n't speak to me . Your presence , your being alive in the same world after that is an insufferable insult ! For you to dare ! Ah ! No woman could say what you thought . No lady "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " Wait !

But I did n't know it ; and I did n't mean anything by anything . No , I could n't . Good-bye . You are right to go . You must n't see me any more . I shall never forget your goodness and patience . " Eagerly : " You would n't want me to forget it , would you ? " Blake , Blake brokenly.  --  " Whatever you do will be right . God bless you , and good-bye .

" Without the inspiration of Blake 's presence , she stands drearily confronting her mother in Mrs. Bellingham 's own room , where the latter , seated in her easy-chair , looks up into Leslie 's face . Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Nothing , Leslie . I am waiting for you to speak . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , I ca n't speak unless you ask me .

" Leslie .  --  Leslie " I do n't understand . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " He looked after the machinery , and saw that the boiler did n't burst ,  --  I do n't know what .

" Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Well , my dear , then I hope that you will acquit me of anything low or snobbish in what I have to say . There is a fitness in all things , and I speak out of respect to that . It is simply impossible that a girl of your breeding and ideas and associations should marry a man of his . Recollect that no one belongs entirely to themselves . You are part of the circle in which you have always moved , and he is part of the circumstances of his life .

Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " We may say that it is no matter what a man has been ; that we are only concerned with what Mr. Blake is now . But the trouble is that every one of us is what they have been . If Mr. Blake 's early associations have been rude and his business coarse , you may be sure they have left their mark upon him , no matter how good he may be naturally . I think he is of a very high and sweet nature ; he seems so "  --  Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , he is , he is ! " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " But he ca n't outlive his own life .

" Leslie .  --  Leslie " O mamma , mamma ! " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Yes , it is so ! The truest love can come to that . And in those moments it is better that all your past and present should be of the same level as his ; for you would n't hesitate to throw any scorn in his teeth ; you would be mad , and you must not have deadly weapons within reach . I speak very plainly . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Terribly ! " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " But that is the worst . There are a thousand lighter trials , which you must meet . Where would you live , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might go to Europe "  --  Leslie .  --  Leslie " I never would sneak away to Europe with him ! " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " I should hope not . But if you remained at home , how would you introduce him to your friends ? Invention is n't a profession ; would you tell them that he was a machinist or a steamboat engineer by trade ? And if they found it out without your telling ? " Leslie , Leslie evasively.  --  " There are plenty of girls who marry men of genius , and it does n't matter what the men have done ,  --  how humble they have been , If they 're geniuses "  --  Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " O Leslie , such men have won all the honours and distinctions before they marry . Girls like you , my dear , do n't marry geniuses in their poverty and obscurity . Those men spend years and years of toil and study , and struggle through a thousand difficulties and privations , and set the world talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary people of our set in society .

" Leslie , Leslie with sudden spirit .  --  " Well , then , mamma , at least I do n't know anything horrid of him , as some girls must know of the young men they marry ,  --  and the old men , too .

I have reasoned with you as a woman of sense , and the return you make is to behave as a petulant child . I will never try to control you in such a matter as this , but you know now what I think , and you can have your own way if you like it better or believe it is wiser than mine . Oh , my poor child !

If he were rich , and had been brought up like me , and I were some poor girl with nothing but her love for him , he would never let the world outweigh her love , as I do his . Do n't praise me , mother ; do n't thank me .

" She drops into a chair near the table and lets full her face into her hands upon it , sobbing . Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Leslie , Leslie ! Be yourself ! How strangely you act ! " Leslie , Leslie lifting her face , to let it gleam a moment upon her mother before she drops it .  --  " Oil , yes , I feel very strangely .

" She casts herself into her mother 's arms , and as she hangs upon her neck in a passion of grief , Mrs. Murray appears in the door-way , and in spite of Mrs. Bellingham 's gesticulated entreaties to retire , advances into the room . II . Mrs. Murray , Bellingham , and Leslie . Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Why , what in the world does all this mean ?

If things are at this pass , and Leslie 's in this mood , it 's the most dangerous moment of the whole affair . If she should meet him now , everything would be lost . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Do n't be troubled . She wo n't meet him ; he 's gone . ' Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " I shall believe that when I see him going .

" Along the road that winds near the nook where the encounter with the tramps took place , Leslie comes languidly pacing with her friend Maggie Wallace , who listens , as they walk , with downcast eyes and an air of reverent devotion , to Leslie 's talk . Her voice trembles a little , and as they pause a moment Maggie draws Leslie 's head down upon her neck , from which the latter presently lifts it fiercely . " I do n't wish , you to pity me , Maggie , for I do n't deserve any pity . I 'm not suffering an atom more than I ought . It 's all my own fault . Mamma really left me quite free , and if I cared more for what people would say and think and look than I did for him , I 'm rightfully punished , and I 'm not going to whimper about it .

Do n't talk in that way , Leslie . Do come back with me to the house and lie down , or I 'm sure you 'll be ill . You look perfectly worn out .

It was very good of you to come with me at all , and now you must go . Say that you left me behind a little way ; that I 'll be there directly . " Maggie .  --  Miss Maggie Wallace " Leslie !

She remains in this dreary reverie till she is startled by a footfall in the road , when she rises in a sudden panic . Blake listlessly advances toward her ; at the sight of her he halts , and they both stand silently regarding each other . II . Leslie and Blake . Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh ! You said you were going away . " Blake .  --  Blake " Are you in such haste to have me gone ? I had to wait for the afternoon stage ; I could n't walk .

I wanted to come and stand here , and think once more that it all really happened  --  that here I saw the pity in your face that made me so glad of my hurt . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " No ; stop ! It was n't pity ! It was nothing good or generous . It was mean regret that I should be under such an obligation to you ; it was a selfish and despicable fear that you would have a claim upon my acquaintance which I must recognise . " Blake makes a gesture of protest and disbelief , and seems about to speak , but she hurries on : " You must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we parted , three hours ago , I have learned to know myself as I never did before , and now I see what a contemptible thing I am .

It was  --  oh , listen ! and try if you can imagine such vileness : I 'm so much afraid of the world I 've always lived in , that no matter how good and brave and wise and noble you were , still if any one should laugh or sneer at you because you had been  --  what you have been  --  I should be ashamed of you .

Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Murray , and Mr. Charles Bellingham . Is the parlour with Mrs. Bellingham and Mrs. Murray sits a gentleman no longer young , but in the bloom of a comfortable middle life , with blonde hair tending to baldness , accurately parted in the middle , and with a handsome face , lazily shrewd , supported by a comely substructure of double chin , and traversed by a full blonde moustache . He is simply , almost carelessly , yet elegantly dressed in a thin summer stuff , and he has an effect of recent arrival . His manner has distinction , enhanced and refined by the eye-glasses which his near-sightedness obliges him to wear . He sits somewhat ponderously in the chair in which he has planted a person just losing its earlier squareness in the lines of beauty ; his feet are set rather wide apart in the fashion of gentlemen approaching a certain weight ; and he has an air of amiable resolution as of a man who having dined well yesterday means to dine well to-day .

" Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh , I believe you , fast enough , but as for looking , you know I could n't tell the man in the moon at this distance , if Leslie happened to be walking home with him . But is the  --  ah  --  fat necessarily in the fire , because "  --  Mrs. Murray whirls away from Bellingham where he remains with his hands on his hips peering over his mother 's shoulder , and pounces upon a large opera-glass which stands on the centre-table , and returning with it thrusts it at him . " Eh ? What ? " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray excitedly .  --  " It 's what we watch the loons on the lake with . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loons on the lake .

Bellingham , Bellingham gravely .  --  " Do you mean , aunt , that you actually want me to watch my sister through an opera-glass , like a shabby Frenchman at a watering-place ? Thanks . I could never look Les in the face again . It 's a little too much like eavesdropping . " He folds his arms , and regards his aunt with reproachful amazement , while she dashes back to set the glass on the table again . Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham in great trouble .  --  " Wait , Kate . Charles , dear , I  --  I think you must . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " What ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Yes , you had better look . You will have to proceed in this matter now , and you must form some conclusions beforehand .

You ca n't tell at this distance , Charles . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " There 's no mistake , mother . I should know Blake on the top of Ponkwasset . He was rather more than a casual acquaintance , you see . By Jove , I ca n't think of the matter with any sort of repose . I can see it all now , just as if it were somebody else : I was weighted down with my accoutrements , and I went over the side of the boat like a flash , and under that yellow deluge like a bullet . I had just leisure to think what a shame it was my life should go for nothing at a time when we needed men so much , when I felt a grip on my hair , "  --  rubbing his bald spot ,  --  " it could n't be done now ! Then I knew I was all right , and waited for developments . The only development was Blake . He fought shy of me , if you 'll believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and had it out with him , and convinced him that he had done rather a handsome thing by me . But that was the end of it . I could n't get him to stand anything else in the way of gratitude . Blake had a vice : he was proud . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " And what became of him ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Who ? Blake ? He was the engineer of the boat , I ought to explain . He was transferred to a gunboat after that , and I believe he stuck to it throughout the fighting on the Mississippi . It 's  --  let me see  --  it 's five years now since I saw him in Nebraska , when I went out there to grow up with the country , and found I could n't wait for it . " After a pause : " I do n't know what it was about Blake ; but he somehow made everybody feel that there was stuff in him . In the three weeks we were together we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked a man better . Well , that 's why , aunt Kate . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " I do n't see that it has anything whatever to do with the matter . The question is whether you wish Leslie to marry a man of his station and breeding , or not . His goodness and greatness have nothing to do with it . The fact remains that he is not at all her equal  --  that he is n't a gentleman "  --  Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh , come now , aunt Kate . You 're not going to tell me that a man who saved my life is n't a gentleman ? " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " And you 're not going to tell me that a steamboat engineer is a gentleman ? " Bellingham , Bellingham disconcerted.  --  " Eh ? " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " The question is , are you going to abandon that unhappy girl to her fancy for a man totally unfit to be her husband simply because he happened to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see , aunt Kate "  --  Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Do you think it would be gentlemanly to do it ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , if you put it that way , no , I do n't . And if you want to know , I do n't see my way to behaving like a gentleman in this connection , whatever I do . " He scratches his head ruefully : " The fact is that the advantages are all on Blake 's side , and he 'll have to manage very badly if he does n't come out the only gentleman in the business . " After a moment : " How was it you did n't put the name and the  --  a  --  profession together , mother , and reflect that this was my Blake ? " Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham with plaintive reproach.  --  " Charles , you know how uncommunicative you were about all your life as a soldier . You never told me half so much about this affair before , and you never  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on knowing , but at the time it was only part of the nightmare in which we were living  --  you never told me his name before . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Did n't I ? Well ! I supposed I had , of course . Um ! That was too bad . I say , mother , Blake has never let anything drop that made you think he had ever known me , or done me any little favour , I suppose ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " No , not the slightest hint . If he had only "  --  Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Ah , that was like him , confound him ! " Bellingham muses again with a hopeless air , and then starts suddenly from his reverie .  --  " Why , the fact is , you know , mother , Blake is really a magnificent fellow ; and you know  --  well , I like him ! " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Oh ! That 's Leslie 's excuse ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are going to take Leslie 's part , it 's fortunate you have common ground . Like him !

" Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " I 'm afraid , my dear , that it ca n't be put off . They must be here , soon . " Bellingham , Bellingham sighi ng.  --  " Well ! Though they did n't seem to be hurrying . " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray bitterly .  --  " If they could only know what a friendly disposition there was towards him here , I 'm sure they 'd make haste ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Um ! " Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham after a pause .  --  " You do n't know anything about his  --  his  --  family , do you , Charles ? ' Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " No , mother , I do n't . My impression is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or  --  protoplasm . All I know about him is that he was from first to last one of those natural gentlemen that upset all your preconceived notions of those things . His associations must have been commoner than  --  well , it 's impossible to compare them to anything satisfactory ; but I never saw a trait in him or heard a word from him that was n't refined . He gave me the impression of a very able man , too , as I was just saying , but where his strength lay , I ca n't say . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Leslie says he 's an inventor . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , very likely . I remember , now : he was a machinist by trade , I believe , and he was an enlisted man on the boat when the engineer was killed ; and Blake was the man who could step right into his place . It was considered a good thing amongst those people . He was a reader in his way , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand when he was off duty ,  --  about physics or metaphysics ; used to talk them up now and then , very well . I never had any doubt about his coming out all right . He 's a baffler , Blake is ,  --  at least he is , for me . Now I suppose aunt Kate , here , does n't find him baffling , at all . She takes our little standards , our little weights and measures , and tests him with them , and she 's perfectly satisfied with the result . It 's a clear case of wo n't do . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " Do you say it is n't ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " No ; I merely doubt if it is . You do n't doubt , and there you have the advantage of me . You always were a selected oyster , aunt Kate , and you always knew that you could n't be improved upon . Now I 'm a selected oyster , too , apparently , but I 'm not certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . I 'm a huitre de mon sicle ; I am the ill-starred mollusk that doubts . Of course we ca n't go counter to the theory that God once created people and no-people , and that they have nothing to do but to go on reproducing themselves and leave him at leisure for the rest of eternity . But really , aunt Kate , I have seen some things in my time  --  and I do n't mind saying Blake is one of them  --  that made me think the Creator was still  --  active . I admit that it sounds "  --  fitting his glasses on  --  " rather absurd for an old diner-out like myself to say it . " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray with energy .  --  " All this is neither here nor there , Charles , and you know it . The simple question is , whether you wish your sister to marry a man whose past you 'll be ashamed to be frank about . I 'll admit , if you like , that he 's quite our equal ,  --  our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ex-steamboat engineer in society ? " Bellingham , Bellingham du biously.  --  " Well , it would be rather awkward . " Mrs. Murray .  --  Mrs. Murray " How will you introduce him , and what will you say to people about his family and his station and business ? Or do you mean to banish yourself and give up the world which you find so comfortable for the boon of a brother-in-law whom you do n't really know from Adam ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , I must allow the force of your argument . Yes , "  --  after a gloomy little reverie ,  --  " you 're right . It wo n't do . It is out of the question . I 'll put an end to it ,  --  if it does n't put an end to me . That ' weird seizure ' as of misappropriated mutton oppresses me again . Mother , I think you 'd better go away ,  --  you and aunt Kate ,  --  and let me meet him and Leslie here alone , when they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detach Les , and let him come in here by himself , somehow ? I do n't suppose it can be done . Nothing seems disposed to let itself be done . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Charles , I 'm sorry this disagreeable business should fall to you . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh , do n't mind it , mother . What 's a brother for , if he ca n't be called upon to break off his sister 's love affairs ? But I do n't deny it 's a nasty business . " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray in retiring .  --  " I sincerely hope he 'll make it so for you , and cure you of your absurdities . " II . Bellingham and Mrs. Bellingham ; Leslie and Blake , without . Bellingham .  --  - Bellingham " O Parthian shaft ! Wish me well out of it , mother ! " Mrs. Bellingham Mrs. Bellingham sighing .  --  " I do , Charles ; I do with all my heart . You have the most difficult duty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how you 're to take hold of it ; I do n't , indeed . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , it is embarrassing . But it 's a noble cause , and I suppose Heaven will befriend me . The trouble is , do n't you know , I have n't got any  --  any point of view , any tenable point of view . It wo n't do to act simply in our own interest ; we ca n't do that , mother ; we 're not the sort . I must try to do it in Blake 's behalf , and that 's what I do n't see my way to , exactly . What I wish to do is to make my interference a magnanimous benefaction to Blake ,  --  something that he 'll recognise in after years with gratitude as a  --  a mysterious Providence . If I 've got to be a snob , mother , I wish to be a snob on the highest possible grounds . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Do n't use that word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellingham " Well , I wo n't , mother . I say : ca n't you think of some disqualifications in Leslie , that I could make a point d'appui in a conscientious effort to serve Blake ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Charles ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " I mean , is n't she rather a worldly , frivolous , fashionable spirit , devoted to pleasure , and incapable of sympathising with  --  with his higher moods , do n't you know ? Something like that ? " Bellingham puts his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets and inclines towards his mother with a hopeful smile . Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " No , Charles ; you know she is nothing of the kind . She 's a girl and she likes amusement , but I should like to see the man whose moods were too lofty for Leslie . She is everything that 's generous and true and high-minded . " Bellingham , Bellinghamscratching his head .  --  " That 's bad ! Then she is n't  --  ah  --  she has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife of a poor man who  --  ah  --  had his way to make in the world ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " She never spends half her allowance on herself ; and besides , Charles ( how ridiculously you talk ! ) , she has all that money your uncle left her , and if she marries him , he wo n't be poor any longer . " Bellingham , Bellingham eag erly.  --  " And that would ruin his career ! Still "  --  after a moment 's thought  --  " I do n't see how I 'm to use that idea , exactly . No , I shall have to fall back on the good old ground that it 's simply  --  out of the question . I think that 's good ; it has a thorough , logical , and final sound . I shall stick to that . Well , leave me to my fate !  --  Hollo ! That 's Blake 's voice , now . I do n't wonder it takes Leslie . It 's the most sympathetic voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? You 'd better go , mother . I wish you could have got Leslie away "  --  Leslie , Leslie without .  --  " Wait for me , there . I must go to mamma 's room at once , and tell her everything . Blake , Blake without .  --  - " Of course . And say that I wish to see her . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Good-bye . " Blake .  --  Blake " Good-bye . " Leslie .  --  Leslie " We wo n't keep you long . Goodbye . " Blake .  --  Blake " Good-bye . " As he enters one of the parlour doors , flushed and radiant , Mrs. Bellingham retreats through the other . III . Blake and Bellingham . Belling ham , Bellingham coming promptly forward to greet Blake , with both hands extended .  --  " Blake ! " Blake , Blake after a moment of stupefaction .  --  " Bellingham ! " Bellingham .  --  Belling ham " My dear old fellow ! " He wrings Blake fervently by the left hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To find you here  --  in New England  --  with my people ; it 's the most wonderful thing that ever was ! They 've been  --  ah  --  been telling me all about you , my mother has ; and I want to thank you  --  you look uncommonly well , Blake , and not a day older ! Do you mean to go through life with that figure ?  --  thank you for all you 've done for them ; and  --  I do n't know : what does a man say to a fellow who has behaved as you did in that business with the tramps ? "  --  wringing Blake 's left hand again and gently touching his right arm in its sling . " By Jove , old fellow ! I do n't know what to say , to you ; I  --  Do you think it was quite the thing , though , not to intimate that you 'd known me ? Come , now ; that was n't fair . It was n't frank . It was n't like you , Blake . Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatic word . Blake , Blake releasing himself .  --  " I did n't like it : but I could n't help it . It would have seemed to claim something , and I should have had to allow  --  they would have found out "  --  Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " That you happened to save my life , once . Well , upon my word , I do n't think it was a thing to be ashamed of ; at least , at that time ; I was in the army , then . At present  --  I do n't know that I should blame you for hushing the matter up . " Blake , Blake who has turned uneasily away , and has apparently not been paying the closest attention to Bellingham 's reproaches , but now confronts him .  --  " I suppose you 're a gentleman , Bellingham . " Bellingham , Bellinghamtaking the abruptness of Blake 's question with amiable irony .  --  " There have been moments in which I have flattered myself to that degree ; even existence itself is problematical , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , I suppose I am a gentleman . The term 's conventional . And then ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I mean that you 're a fair-minded , honest man , and that I can talk to you without the risk of being misunderstood or having any sort of meanness attributed to me ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " I should have to be a much shabbier fellow than I am , for anything of that sort , Blake . " Blake .  --  Blake " I did n't expect to find you here ; I was expecting to speak with your mother . But I do n't see why I should n't say to you what I have to say . In fact , I think I can say it better to you . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Thanks , Blake ; you 'll always find me your  --  That is  --  well , go ahead ! " Blake .  --  Blake " You do n't think I 'm a man to do anything sneaking , do you ? " Bellingham .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without saying . It 's out of the question . " Blake , Blake walking up and down , and stopping from time to time while he speaks in a tone of passionate self-restraint .  --  " Well , I 'm glad to hear that , because I know that to some the thing might have a different look . " After a pause , in which Blake takes another turn round the room and arrives in front of Bellingham again : " If your people have been telling you about me , I suppose they 've hinted  --  but I do n't care to know it  --  that they think I 'm in love with Miss Bellingham , your sister . I am ! " He looks at Bellingham , who remains impassive behind the glitter of his eye-glasses : " Do you see any reason why I should n't be ? " Bellingham , Bellingham relucta ntly.  --  " N-no . " Blake .  --  Blake " I believe  --  no , I ca n't believe it !  --  but I know that Miss Bellingham permits it ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any  --  any reason why I should n't ask her mother 's leave to ask her to be my wife ? Why , of course , there is !  --  a thousand , million reasons in my unworthiness ; I know that . But is there "  --  Bellingham , Bellingham ab ruptly.  --  " Blake , my dear fellow  --  my dear , good old boy  --  it wo n't do ; it 's out of the question ! It is , it is indeed ! It wo n't do at all . Confound it , man ! You know I like you , that I 've always wanted to be a great deal more your friend than you would ever let me . Do n't ask me why , but take my word for it when I tell you it 's out of the question . There are a thousand reasons , as you say , though there is n't one of them in any fault of yours , old fellow . But I ca n't give them . It wo n't do ! " Bellingham in his turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of acute misery and hopelessness , and at the last word he stops and stares helplessly into Blake 's eyes , who has remained in his place . Blake , Blake with suppressed feeling .  --  " Do you expect me to be satisfied with that answer ? " Bellingham , Bellingham at first confused and then with a burst of candour .  --  " No ; I would n't , myself . " His head falls , and a groan breaks from his lips : " This is the roughest thing I ever knew of . Hang it , Blake , do n't you see what a  --  a  --  box I 'm in ? People pulling and hauling at me , and hammering away on all sides , till I do n't know which end I 'm standing on ! You would n't like it yourself . Why do you ask ? Why must you be  --  ah  --  satisfied ? Come ! Why do n't you let it all  --  go ! " Blake .  --  Blake " Upon my word , Bellingham , you talk " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it . And it 's strictly in character . At the present moment I feel like a fool . I am a fool ! By Jove , if I ever supposed I should get into such a tight place as this ! Why , do n't you see , Blake , what an extremely unfair advantage you have of me ? Deuce take it , man , I have some rights in the matter , too , I fancy ! " Blake , Blake bewildered .  --  " Rights ? Advantage ? I do n't understand all this . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " How not understand ? " Blake , Blake gazing in mystified silence at Bellingham for a brief space , and then resuming more steadily .  --  " There 's some objection to me , that 's clear enough . I do n't make any claim , but you would think I ought to know what the matter is , would n't you ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Y-yes , Blake . " Blake .  --  Blake " I know that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look as if "  --  Bellingham , Bellingham hasti ly.  --  " Oh , not in the least  --  not in the least ! " Blake  --  Blake " Our acquaintance was n't regularly made , I believe . But you do n't suppose that I urged it , or that it would have been kept up if it had n't been for their kindness and for chances that nobody foresaw ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingh am " There is n't a circumstance of the whole affair that is n't perfectly honourable to you , Blake  --  that is n't like you . Confound it "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " I wo n't ask you whether you think I thought of her being rich ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " No , sir ! That would be offensive . " Blake .  --  Blake " Then what is it ? Is there some personal objection to me with your family ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " There is n't at all , Blake , I assure you . " Blake .  --  Blake " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit  --  " I want to say once for all that I think your leaving me to ask these things and put myself on the defensive in this way , begging you for this reason and for that , is n't what I 'm used to . But I 'm like a man on trial for his life , and I stand it . Now , go on and say what there is to say . Do n't spare my feelings , man ! I have no pride where she is concerned . What do you know against me that makes it impossible ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " O Lord ! It is n't against you . It 's nothing personal ; personally we 've all reason to respect and honour you ; you 've done us nothing but good in the handsomest way . But it wo n't do for all that . There 's an incompatibility  --  a  --  a  --  I do n't know what to call it ! Confound it , Blake ! You know very well that there 's none of that cursed nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in life ; I only ask what he is in himself . I accept the American plan in good faith . I know all sorts of fellows ; devilish good fellows some of them are , too ! Why , I had that Mitchell , who behaved so well at the Squattick Mills disaster , to dine with me ; went down and looked him up , and had him to dine with me . Some of the men did n't think it was the thing ; but I can assure you that he talked magnificently about the affair . I drew him out , and before we were done we had the whole room about us . I would n't have missed it on any account . That 's my way . " Blake , Blake drily.  --  " It 's a very magnanimous way . The man must have felt honoured . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " What ?  --  Oh , deuce take it ! I do n't mean any of that patronising rot , you know I do n't . You know I think such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I mean is that it 's different with women . They have n't got the same  --  what shall I say  --  horizons , social horizons , do n't you know ? They ca n't accept a man for what he is in himself . They have to take him for what he is n't in himself . They have to have their world carried on upon the European plan , in short . I do n't know whether I make myself understood "  --  Blake , Blake with hardness.  --  " Yes , you do . The objection is to my having been "  --  Bellingham , Bellingham has tily interposing .  --  " Well  --  ah  --  no ! I ca n't admit that . It is n't the occupation . We 've all been occupied more or less remotely in  --  in some sort of thing ; a man 's a fool who tries to blink that . But I do n't know that I can make it clear how our belonging , now , to a different order of things makes our women distrustful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the influence of  --  ah  --  other social circumstances . They 're mere creatures of tradition , women are , and where you or I , Blake , "  --  with caressing good comradeship and the assumption of an impartial high-mindedness ,  --  " would n't care a straw for a man 's trade or profession , they are more disposed to  --  ah  --  particularise , and  --  do n't you know  --  distinguish ! " Blake , Blake gravel y.  --  " I tried to make Miss Bellingham understand from the first just what I was and had been . I certainly never concealed anything . Do you think she would care for what disturbs the other ladies of your family ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Leslie ? Well , she 's still a very young girl , and she has streaks of originality that rather disqualify her for appreciating  --  ah  --  She 's romantic ! I 'm sure I 'm greatly obliged to you , Blake , for taking the thing in this reasonable way . You know how to sympathise with one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of the kind . " Blake , Blake with a sad , musing tone .  --  " Yes , God knows I 'm sorry for you . I do n't suppose you like to do it . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Thanks , thanks , Blake . It was quite as much on your own account that I spoke . They would make it deucedly uncomfortable for you in the family ,  --  there 's no end to the aunts and grandmothers , and things , and you 'd make them uncomfortable too , with your  --  history . " Mopping his forehead with his handkerchief : " You have it infernally hot , up here , do n't you ? " Blake , Blake still musingly.  --  " Then you think that Miss Bellingham herself would n't be seriously distressed ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Leslie 's a girl that will go through anything she 's made up her mind to . And if she likes you well enough to marry you "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " She says so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the smallest effect upon her . But "  --  Blake , Blake quietly .  --  " Then I wo n't give her up . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Eh ? " Blake .  --  Blake " I wo n't give her up . It 's bad enough as it is , but if I were such a sneak as to leave the woman who loved me because my marrying her would be awkward for her friends , I should be ten thousand times unworthier than I am . I am going to hold to my one chance of showing myself worthy to win her , and if she will have me I will have her , though it smashes the whole social structure . Bellingham , you 're mistaken about this thing ; her happiness wo n't depend upon the success of the aunts and cousins in accounting for me to the world ; it 'll depend upon whether I 'm man enough to be all the world to her , If she thinks I am , I will be ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingh am " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake . Confound it ! I know ; I can account for your state of feeling , and all that ; but I do assure you it 's mistaken . Let me put it to you . You do n't see this matter as I do ; you ca n't . The best part of a woman 's life is social "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " I do n't believe that . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , no matter : it 's so ; and whether you came into Leslie 's world or took her out of it , you 'd make no end of  --  of  --  row . She 'd suffer in a thousand ways . " Blake .  --  Blake " Not if she loved me , and was the kind of girl I take her to be . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh yes , she would , my dear fellow ; Leslie 's a devilish proud girl ; she 'd suffer in secret , but it would try her pride in ways you do n't know of . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this affair ; she 's had no time to think "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " She shall have my whole lifetime to make up her mind in ; she shall test me in every way she will , and she may fling me away at any moment she will , and I will be her slave for ever . She may give me up , but I will not give her up . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , well ! We wo n't dispute about terms , but I 'll put it to you , yourself , Blake ,  --  yourself . I want you to see that I 'm acting for your good , that I 'm your friend . " Blake .  --  Blake " You 're her brother , and you 're my friend , whatever you say . I 've borne to have you insinuate that I 'm your inferior . Go on ! " Blake 's voice trembles . Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh , now ! Do n't take that tone ! It is n't fair . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , indeed . I do n't mean anything of the kind . I mean simply that  --  that  --  ah  --  remote circumstances over which you had  --  ah  --  no control , have placed you at a disadvantage ,  --  social disadvantage . That 's all . It is n't a question of inferiority or superiority . And I merely put it to you  --  as a friend , mind  --  whether the happiness of  --  ah  --  all concerned could n't be more promptly  --  ah  --  secured by your refusing to submit to tests that might  --  Come now , my dear fellow ! She 's flattered  --  any woman might be  --  by your liking her ; but when she went back to her own associations  --  " Blake .  --  Blake " If she sees any man she likes better than me , I wo n't claim her . But I ca n't judge her by a loyalty less than my own . She will never change . " Bellingham essays an answer , but after some preliminary ahs and ums , abruptly desists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with jealous quickness : " What do you mean ? Out with it , man ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Do n't take it in that way ! My dear fellow "  --  Blake .  --  Blake " If I 'm her caprice and not her choice , I want to know it ! I wo n't be killed by inches . Speak ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Stop ! I owe you my life , but you must n't take that tone with me . " Blake .  --  Blake " You owe me nothing ,  --  nothing but an answer . If you mean there has been some one before me  --  She has told me that she never cared for any one but me ; I believe her , but I want to know what you mean . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " She 's my sister ! What do you mean ? " IV . Leslie , Blake , and Bellingham . Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , what does it mean ? " She enters the room , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry voices from a guiltless ambush in the hall . At the sight of their flushed faces and defiant attitudes she flutters , electrically attracted , first toward one and then toward the other , but at last she instinctively takes shelter at Blake 's elbow : " Charles , what are you saying ? What are you both so angry for ? Oh , I hoped to find you such good friends , and here you are quarrelling ! Charles , what have you been doing ! O Charles , I always thought you were so generous and magnanimous , and have you been joining that odious conspiracy against us ? For shame ! And what have you found to say , I should like to know ? I should like to know what you 've found to say  --  what a gentleman could say , under the circumstances ! " She grows more vehement as their mutual embarrassment increases upon the men , and Bellingham fades into a blank dismay behind the glitter of his eye-glasses . " Have you been saying something you 're ashamed of , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you 've been trying to set him against me . What have you said about your sister , Charles ?  --  and always pretending to be so fond of me ! Oh , oh , oh ! " Miss Bellingham snatches her handkerchief from her pocket and hides her grief in it , while her brother remains in entire petrifaction at her prescience . Bellingham , Bellingham finally .  --  " Why , Leslie  --  Deuce take it all , Blake , why do n't you say something ? I tell you , I have n't said anything against you , Les . Blake will tell you himself that I was merely endeavouring to set the thing before him from different points of view . I wanted him to consider the shortness of your acquaintance "  --  Leslie , Leslie in her handkerchief .  --  " It 's fully three weeks since we met ,  --  you know it is . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " And I wanted him to reflect upon how very different all your associations and  --  traditions  --  were "  --  Leslie , Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delicate  --  very ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellin gham " And to  --  ah  --  take into consideration the fact that returning to another  --  atmosphere  --  surroundings , you might  --  ah  --  change . " Leslie , Leslielifting her face .  --  " You did ! Charles , did I ever change ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Well , I do n't know . I do n't know whether you 'd call it changing , exactly ; but I certainly got the impression from aunt Kate that there was some hope on Dudley 's part last summer "  --  Leslie , Leslie quitting her refuge and advancing fiercely upon the dismayed but immoveable Bellingham with her right hand thrust rigidly down at her side , and her left held behind her clutching her handkerchief .  --  " Charles , have you dared to intimate that I ever cared the least thing about that  --  that  --  horrid  --  little  --  reptile ? When you knew that my life was made perfectly ghastly by the way aunt Kate forced him on me , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decently ! I never encouraged him for an instant , and you know it . Oh , Charley , Charley , how could you ? It is n't for myself I care ; it 's for you , for you 're a gentleman , and you let yourself do that ! How painfully strange that low , mean , shabby feeling must have been to you ! I do n't wonder you could n't face me or speak to me . I do n't "  --  Bellingham , Bellingham de sperately.  --  " Here ; hold on ! Good Lord ? I ca n't stand this ! Confound it , I 'm not made of granite  --  or guttapercha . I 'll allow it was sneaking ,  --  Blake will tell you I looked it ,  --  but it was a desperate case . It was a family job , and I had to do my best  --  or my worst  --  as the head of the family ; and Blake would n't hear reason , and "  --  Leslie .  --  Leslie " And so you thought you 'd try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should n't use that word . But it 's the privilege of your sex to call a spade a pitchfork , if you do n't like the spade . I tell you I never professed to know anything personally about the Dudley business , and I did n't say anything about it ; when Blake caught me up so , I was embarrassed to think how I might have mentioned it in  --  in the heat of argument . Come , Blake "  --  Leslie , Leslie turning and going devoutly up to Blake .  --  " Yes , he will defend you . He must save your honour since he saved your life . " Bellingham , Bellingham with a start .  --  " Eh ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Oh , I know about it ! Mamma told me . She thinks just as I do , now , and she has been feeling dreadfully about this shabby work she 'd set you at ; but I comforted her . I told her you would never do it in the world ; that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Bellingham " Oh , thanks ! " Leslie .  --  Leslie " But that you had too good a heart , too high a spirit , to breathe a syllable that would wound the pride of a brave and generous man to whom you owed life itself : that you would rather die than do it ! " To Blake : " Oh , I 've always been a romantic girl ,  --  you wo n't mind it in me , will you ?  --  and I 've had my foolish dreams a thousand times about the man who risked his life to save my brother 's ; and I hoped and longed that some day we should meet . I promised myself that I should know him , and I always thought how sweet and dear a privilege it would be to thank him . I want to thank you for his life as I used to dream of doing , but I can not yet . I can not till you tell me that he has not said one word unworthy of you  --  unworthy of a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's all right ! " Leslie , Leslie impetuously clinging to him .  --  " Oh , thanks , thanks , thanks ! " Bellingham , Bellingham acc urately focusing the pair with freshly adjusted glasses .  --  " If you 'll both give me your blessing , now , I 'll go away , feeling perfectly rehabilitated , in the afternoon stage . " V. Mrs. Bellingham , and Leslie , Blake , and Bellingham ; afterwards Mrs. Murray . Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham entering the parlour door .  --  " Stage ? Why , Mr. Blake is n't going away ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh , no , Mr. Blake has kindly consented to remain . It was I who thought of going . I ca n't bear to be idle ! " Mrs. Bellingham , Mrs. Bellingham apart from the others ,  --  " Charles , dear , I 'm sorry I asked you to undertake that disagreeable business , and I 'd have come back at once , with Leslie to relieve you ,  --  to tell you that you need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't , and she insisted upon leaving you together , and then stealing back upon you and enjoying "  --  Bellingham , Bellinghamsolemnly.  --  " You little knew me , mother . I have the making of an iron-hearted parent in me , and I was crushing all hope out of Blake when Leslie came in . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Charles , you do n't mean that you said anything to wound the feelings of a man to whom you owed your life ,  --  to whom we all owe so much ? " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " I do n't know about his feelings . But I represented pretty distinctly to him the social incompatibility . " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Charles , I wonder at you ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh , yes ! So do I. But if you 'll take the pains to recall the facts , that 's exactly what you left me to do . May I ask what has caused you to change your mind ? " Mrs. Bellingham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness really depended upon it ; and in fact , Charles , when I came to reflect , I found that I myself liked him . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " The words have a familiar sound ,  --  as if I had used them myself in a former existence . " Turning from his mother and looking about : " I seem to miss a  --  a support  --  moral support  --  in those present . Where is aunt Kate ! " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray appearing at the door .  --  " Marion ! Ma "  --  She hesitates at sight of the peaceful grouping . Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Ah , this is indeed opportune ! Come in , aunt Kate , come in ! This is a free fight , as they say in Mr. Blake 's section . Any one can join . " Mrs. Murray advances wonderingly into the room , and Bellingham turns to his sister , where she stands at Blake 's side : " Leslie , you think I 've behaved very unhandsomely in this matter , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charley , you know I hate to blame you . But I never could have believed it if any one else had told me . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " All right . Mother , I understand that you would have been similarly incredulous ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " I know that you acted from a good motive , Charles , but you certainly went to an extreme that I could never have expected . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " All right , again . Blake , if the persons and relations had all been changed , could you have said to me what I said to you ? " Blake .  --  Blake " That is n't a fair question , Bellingham . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " All right , as before . Now , aunt Kate , I appeal to you . You know all the circumstances in which I was left here with this man who saved my life , who rescued Leslie from those tramps , who has done you all a thousand kindnesses of various sorts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion throughout , and is in himself a thoroughly splendid fellow . Do you think I did right or wrong to set plainly before him the social disadvantages to which his marrying Leslie would put us ? " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray instantly and with great energy .  --  " Charles , I say  --  and every person in society , except your mother and sister , would say  --  that you did exactly right ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " That settles it . Blake , my dear old fellow , I beg your pardon with all my heart ; and I ask you to forget , if you can , every word I said . Confound society ! " He offers his hand to Blake , who seizes it and wrings it in his own . Leslie , Leslie as she flings her arms round his neck , with a fluttering cry of joy .  --  " Oh , Charley , Charley , I 've got my ideal back again ! " Bellingham , Bellingham dise ngaging her arms and putting her hand into Blake's.  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And now , aunt , I beg your pardon . What do you say ? " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray frozenly.  --  " Charles , you know my principles . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " They 're identical on all points with my own . Well ? " Mrs. Murray , Mrs. Murray grimly .  --  " Well , then , you know that I never would abandon my family , whatever happened ! " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " By Jove , that is n't so bad . We must be satisfied to take your forgiveness as we get it . Perhaps Leslie might object to the formulation of "  --  Leslie , Leslie super-joyousl y.  --  " Oh , no ! I object to nothing in the world , now , Charles . Aunt Kate is too good ! I never should have thought of asking her to remain with us . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " That is n't so bad , either ! You are your aunt 's own niece . Come , Blake , we ca n't let this go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this family . " Blake .  --  Blake " I think I 'd better not try . But if you 'll give me time , I 'll do my best to live down the objections to me . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Oh , you 've done that . What we want now  --  as I understand aunt Kate  --  is that you should live down the objections to us . One thing that puzzles me "  --  thoughtfully scratching the sparse parting of his hair  --  " is that our position is so very equivocal in regard to the real principle involved . It seems to me that we are begging the whole question , which is , if Blake "  --  Leslie .  --  Leslie " There , there ! I knew he would ! " Bellingham , Bellingham seve rely .  --  " Mother , you will allow that I have been left to take the brunt of this little affair in a  --  well , somewhat circuitous manner ? " Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Charles , I am very , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am entitled to some sort of reparation ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " Do n't allow that , mamma ! I know he 's going to say something disagreeable . He looks just as he always does when he has one of his ideas , " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " Thanks , Miss Bellingham . I am going to have this particular satisfaction out of you . Then I will return to my habitual state of agreeable vacancy . Mother "  --  Leslie .  --  Leslie " Mamma , do n't answer him ! It 's the only way . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingh am " It is not necessary that I should be answered . I only wish to have the floor . The question is , if Blake were merely a gentleman somewhat at odds with his history , associations , and occupation , and not also our benefactor and preserver in so many ways ,  --  whether we should be so ready to  --  ah "  --  Mrs. Bellingham .  --  Mrs. Bellingham " Charles , dear , I think it is unnecessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Mrs. Murray " I feel bound to say that I know we should not . " Bellingham .  --  Bellingham " This is the point which I wished to bring out . Blake , here is your opportunity : renounce us ! " Blake .  --  Blake " What do you say , Leslie ? " Leslie .  --  Leslie " I say that I do n't believe it , and I know that I like you for yourself ,  --  not for what you 've done for us . I did from the first moment , before you spoke or saw me . But if you doubt me , or should ever doubt me "  --  Blake , Blake taking in his left both the little hands that she has appealingly laid upon his arms .  --  " That 's out of the question !
