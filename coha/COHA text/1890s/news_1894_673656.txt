txt Chauncey M. Depew was seen this afternoon by a reporter for the United Press . who asked him whether he would accept the Republican nomination for Governor of the State of New York . " I am not a candidate for the nomination , " Mr. Depew said . ? ' Before I left New York leading men of the different factions of the Republican Party called upon me and said that if I would accept , no other name would be put in nomination . " I at that time positively declined . Since then I have received a large number of letters and cablegrams on the subject . " Much as I like politics , my business interests are too great , and the responsibility of my different trusts can not be resigned , which , if I accepted the nomination , would be necessary . " I will not say that under no conditions would I accept the nomination . because there are circumstances under which I might ; but it is hardly possible that they will arise . " My relations have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter who may be the nominee of the party ; he will have my heartiest support in every way . " The coming election will decide the next Presidential contest , and I have no doubt of the success of our party . I do not mean that we will have a walkover . I expect a good fight , and I believe that the element of factions will be eliminated from this election by both parties . Tammany Hall will surrender to Cleveland in order to retain its hold on the offices . " As for the financial condition , I think we have reached the bottom . While a few setbacks are possible , I look forward within a year or two to an era of prosperity unequaled in the history of the country . I have just finished my annual European holiday . " I am well and strong , and will sail for New-York to-morrow . " Mr. Depew will be a passenger on the New-York , sailing from Southampton . MR . BROOKFIELD 'S DECLARATION . it , he said , it meant that he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a score of the best years of his life . Hence , he  - -  said , when he considered it he faced a crisis . Inasmuch as the same great work must be given up to become Governor of New York , it was naturally asked if he had not in his cable message decided to do hip part toward carrying out the entire programme . The events which have led up to the cable message to Dr. Depew have not fully been made public . The request which ' was sent to him had more behind it than the anti-Platt men in New-York County . They took the action after- , they had received information and suggestions , if not promises , from other parts of the State . There is evidence that some of the men whose names have been spoken of as candidates were as well informed as to what was going on as the local friends of Dr. Depew , who paid the cable tolls . Taken as an Official Announcement of Dr. Depew 's Candidacy . Chairman William Brookfield of the Republican State Committee made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered an official announcement that Dr. Chauncey M. Depew is an avowed candidate for the Gubernatorial nomination this year . Mr. Brook-field 's declaration caused a scrambling among the Gubernatorial boomers who have been in and about the hotel for the last few days . There were the Fassett boom , the Miller boom , and the Morton ' boom , all on exhibition at the time . Mr. - Fassett was there in person , and the Miller interests , which have been kept remarkably cftzlet in this city , possibly awaiting the arrival of ex-Congressman Henry G. Burleigh of ' Whitehall , were last night in charge of John W. Vrooman of Herkimer County , who was Mr. Fassett 's running mate three years ago . The anti-Platt men were in a happy frame of mind . According to their view of the situation it only needed the announcement from Dr. Depew to break up the Platt forces in this city . The Union League Club men , they expect , will now break from Mr. Morton , the Committee of Thirty 's district leaders , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans they count as under the Depew flag . Counting out the Milholland men , who are not enrolled , they believe , there - will be enough anti-Platt men to divide the New-York delegation to Saratoga , into fairly even proportions . From this time on they predicted such scenes as have not been seen in the Republican camp for some time , with the pcssible overthrow of Mr. Platt on Sept. 18 , or thereabout . They were optimistic on this point . The declaration of Mr. Brookfield was this : " I am reliably informed that a cable ' message has been received from Dr. Depew in which he says he will accept the nomination if it is tendered to him . ' Further than this the Chairman would not discuss the matter . " Are you pleased at his message ? " Mr. Brookfield was asked . " I have nothing more to say on the subject than that I believe the message has been received , " he replied . It was but a short time after Mr. Brookfield said this that all the politicians were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no difference with their programme . They would still go on doing their best to secure delegates for the Chemung County man . They agreed that the declaration would mix the situation and probably cause such a fight in the convention as would be worth witnessing . Mr. Fassett himself thought it would make the fight hotter than it has been . " I think , " said Mr. Fassett to a reporter for The New-York Times , " that it is very likely that a large number of prominent Republicans have asked Mr. Depew to be the candidate . He is a man of great ability and international reputation , who has always been a consistent Republican . I think it possible and proper that he should add his name to the list of those who are willing to serve their party , either in the ranks as a private soldier or at the head of the column as a Major General . But , if he has , it will only make the fun livelier . " Dr. Depew knows the history of this State , its needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor , if elected in response to the wishes of a majority of the delegates to the convention at Saratoga. " - The declaration of Dr. Depew , if it means what it was thought to mean  --  that he has decided to contest for honors with Mr. Platt 's candidate , Mr. Morton  --  makes the position of each of those who used to be the Big Four pretty clearly understood , and has a side which is serious for the Republicans of the State . Mr. Platt , Mr. Miller , and Mr. Depew , under this announcement , are no longer acting in partnership , but each for himself . Mr. Hiscock has not been heard from . Each of the three has a strong following all over the State , and the result of a three-cornered fight under those three leaders promises a picturesque spectacle . It was said last night by one of Mr. Fassett 's supporters that the most surprised man in the State would probably be Mr. Morton . Returning from a stay of several months abroad , he had been given to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had arisen as one man and demanded that he lead in the contest He was given to understand that the convention , if he would accept the nomination , would be a one-roll-call affair , whose principal business would be to nominate a candidate for Lieutenant Governor , select a good man for Judge of the Court of Appeals , and adjourn after a few congratulatory speeches . Dr. Depew 's cable , it was argued , changed this programme , and under the light of events which led to this cable message the proposition was flatly put forth last night that the ex-Vice President had simply been made the victim of a bunko game . " The gripsack is full of sawdust , " was one of the comments made last night . The talk of selecting a Presidential candidate this year , which has been lacking for the last few days , was again going at a lively rate . Some time before be went to Europe , Dr. Depew said for publication that many of his Republican friends had submitted a programme to him which included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
