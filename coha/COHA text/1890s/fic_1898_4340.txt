BEYOND THE MARSHES*** E-text prepared by Al Haines BEYOND THE MARSHES by RALPH CONNOR Author of " Black Rock " and " The Sky Pilot " The Westminster Company Limited Publishers Toronto Entered according to Act of the Parliament of Canada , in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight , by The Westminster Company , Limited , at the Department of Agriculture . Have you ever caught the scent of the clover as you were whirled away by the train beyond the city on a summer 's day and sped through the rich pasture lands ? And do you remember how you stepped forth at the first halting-place to secure a sprig of the sweet , homely flower that had spoken to you so eloquently in its own language , and how you pressed it in your book ? Does not its perfume remain with you till this day ? And every now and then a fragrance is wafted to our inner senses as we read some simple story which is to us as a breath of the clover , bringing us a message of sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power that belongs to the secrets which lie hidden at our lifers core . And this sweet prairie idyll is surely one of those fragrant messages which lays its hold on us as we pause for a moment in the midst of our fevered lives and anxious thoughts , and step across the threshold of that chamber where we must needs put our shoes from off our feet , for the place whereon we stand is holy ground . And as we press on again to life 's duties , may we bear with us something of the precious perfume diffused by plants which are divine in their origin and which must be divine in their influence . ISHBEL ABERDEEN BEYOND THE MARSHES The missionary of the Bonjour field found me standing bag in hand upon the railway platform watching my train steam away to the east . He is glad to see me . I am of his own kind , and there are so few of his kind about that his welcome is strong and warm . He is brown and spare and tough-looking . For six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drenched by rains , scorched by suns , and pursued by the flies . As to the flies there is something to be said . They add much to the missionary 's burden , and furnish unequaled opportunity for the exercise of the Christian graces of patience and self-control . In early spring they appear , and throughout the whole summer they continue in varying forms , but in unvarying persistence and ferocity . There are marsh flies , the bulldogs , " which take the piece right out , " the gray wings , the blue devils ( local name ) , which doubtless take several pieces right out , the mosquitoes , unsleeping , unmerciful , unspeakable , the sand flies , which go right in and disappear , and the black flies . " When do they go away ? " I asked a native . " Oh , them black fellows go away on snow-shoes . " These each and all have taken a nip and a suck from the missionary as he pushed on by night and by day through their savage territory . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got all the juice out of him , but they have left the sinew and the bone . His nerve , too , is all there , and his heart is sound and " under his ribs , " which one of his admiring flock considers the right spot . It is Saturday afternoon , and we are to drive to the farthest of his three stations to be ready for the Communion Service there , at half-past ten to-morrow morning . " Where does it lie ? " I ask . " Oh , away beyond the Marshes , " was the answer . Every one evidently knows where the Great Marshes are . But first we must drink a delicious cup of tea from a brave young Scotchwoman , who has learned the trick of making a home for her husband and babies amid the limitations of Canadian wilds , little like the Edinburgh home where she herself was a baby , and which she left not so very long ago . Then we must take a look at the new manse of which the missionary feels he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mostly the work of his own hand . He , like his great Master , is a carpenter , and day and night in the pauses of his preaching and visiting and studying , he has wrought at it , getting such help as he can , till there it stands , among the trees , the little cottage manse , announcing to all that the mission has come to stay . The front room , with writing-desk , book-shelf , table , all of the missionary 's making , does for reception and dining room , study , and parlor . Behind it is the kitchen , with ingenious cupboards ; and opening off from this the bedroom , five by seven , with bedstead and washstand , both home-made , and both nailed fast to the wall . Altogether a snug little , tight little house , going a long way to content one with being a bachelor . And now we hitch up Golddust , and are off through the glorious yellow light and purple haze of this September afternoon . Golddust is the missionary 's horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as his owner thinks his speed , his spirit , and other characteristics , he inherits from his sire , Old Golddust of Western racing fame . Old Golddust , if he has transmitted his characteristics , must have been a horse of singular modesty , for his son continues resolutely unwilling throughout this drive to make any display of his nobler qualities . By an extraordinary piece of good fortune , due to an evil but unfair report of Golddust in his young days , " they did n't know how to handle him . " the missionary had bought him for twenty-five dollars ! One result of the deal has been an unlimited confidence on the part of the missionary in his own horse-dealing instinct . It is quite true that Golddust has not always shown his present mild and trustful disposition . Indeed , the missionary goes on to tell how , being loaned for a day to a brother missionary up west , the horse had returned in the evening much excited , but not much the worse , with a pair of shafts dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the day following , and then in a shocking bad temper . " He was a Methodist brother , and did n't understand horses " ; and the happy , far-away look in the face of his present owner led me to doubt whether that day 's exploit had lowered Golddust in his estimation . Meantime we are drinking deep of the delights of this mellow afternoon . On either side of our trail lie yellow harvest fields , narrow , like those of eastern Canada , and set in frames of green poplar bluffs that rustle and shimmer under the softly going wind . Then on through scrub we go , bumping over roots and pitching through holes , till we suddenly push out from the scrub , and before us lie the Marshes . There they sweep for miles away , with their different grasses waving and whispering under the steady blowing breeze , first the red-top , then as the soil grows wet the blue-joint and the swamp grass , and out of the standing water the dark green reeds , and farthest in the tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-top and blue-joint reaches are the hay-lands of the settlers about . Skirting the edge of the Marshes , we push again through straggling scrub , then past more marshes , and into woods where we follow a winding trail till it leads us into a little clearing . In the center of the clearing stands a cluster of log buildings  --  stables of different kinds , milk-house , the old shanty , and at a little distance the new house , all looking snug and trim . Through the bars we drive into the yard filled with cattle , for the milking time is on . A shy lad of ten , with sun-burned , freckled face and good blue eyes , comes forward and is greeted as " Donald " by the missionary . " Hello , Donald , how are you ? " I ask , opening the conversation . Donald looks at me and is inaudible , meanwhile unhitching Golddust with marvelous rapidity . " How many cattle have you , Donald ? " I venture again . Donald evidently considered this a reasonable question , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a pity we can find no spelling to reproduce that combination of guttural and aspirate and the inimitable inflection of voice . It is so delightful that I ask him again , and again the answer comes with even more emphasis upon guttural and aspirate , and an added curve to the inflection : " Abou-e-t the-r-r-h-ty . " My heart goes out to him , and watching his neat , quick work with Golddust , I begin to understand the look of thrift about the yard . It is the mark of the " weel daein " Scot . We go up to the door of the new log house . Before the door are two broad , flat stones washed clean . " Scotch again , " I say to myself . Had I not seen them in many a Scotch village in front of the little stone cottages , thatched and decked with the climbing rose ! The door is opened by Mrs. McPhail . That is not her name , of course . I am not going to outrage the shy modesty of that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to see . A dear little woman she is , bowed somewhat with the burden of her life , but though her sweet face is worn and thin , it is very bright , and now it is aglow with welcome to her friend the missionary . She welcomes me , too , but with a gentle reserve . She is ready enough to give of her heart 's wealth , but only to those she has learned to trust . And my friend has gained a full reward for his six months ' work in that he has won this woman 's willing trust . When the flush called up by the greeting dies , I see how pale she is , and I wonder how the winds and frosts and fierce suns have left so little trace upon the face of a Manitoba farmer 's wife . I understand this later , but not now . When she was a girl , her hair was thick and fair , but now it is white and thin , and is drawn smoothly back and fastened in a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , are blue still , but faded , for tears , salt and hot , have washed out the color . She wears a flannel dress , simple and neat ; and the collar at the neck and the lace-edged kerchief at the breast and the tidy daintiness of all about her make her a picture of one who had been in her youth " a weel brocht-up lass . " Her house is her mirror . The newly plastered , log-built walls are snow-white , the pine floor snow-white , and when the cloth is spread for tea , it , too , is snow-white . Upon the wall hangs a row of graduated pewter platter covers . How pathetically incongruous are they on the walls of this Canadian log house ! But they shine . The table and the chairs shine . The spoons and knives and glasses and dishes shine , glitter . The whole kitchen is spotless , from the white window blinds to the white floor , and there is a glitter on every side , from the pathetic pewter covers on the wall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in , a small man with a quiet , husky voice and a self-respecting manner . His eye is clear and dark blue , and has a look of intellect in it . When he speaks he has a way of looking straight into you with a steady , thoughtful gaze . A man would find it equally difficult to doubt or to deceive him . The pioneer life has bowed his body and subdued his spirit , but the whole mass of his trials and the full weight of his burdens have not broken his heart 's courage , nor soured its sweetness , nor dimmed his hope in God . We are invited to tea with an air of apologetic cordiality . The food is fit for princes  --  home-made bread white and flaky , butter yellow and sweet , eggs just from the nest , and cream . There is cream enough for your tea , for fruit , and to drink ! Cake there is , too , and other dainties ; but not for me . No cake nor dainty can tempt me from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I much doubt if she has as good ! God bless her ! At the head and foot of the table sit the father and mother , and Alexander , Jean , and Donald , with the missionary and myself , make up the company . The children take their tea in silence but for a whispered request now and then , or a reply to some low-toned direction from the mother . They listen interested in their elders ' talk , and hugely amused at the jokes . There is no pert interjection of smart sayings , so awful in ill-trained children of ill-bred parents . They have learned that ancient and almost forgotten doctrine that children should be seen . I tell my best stories and make my pet jokes just to see them laugh . They laugh , as they do everything else , with a gentle reserve ; and occasionally Jean , a girl of fifteen , shy like the rest , pulls herself up with a blush lest she has been unduly moved to laughter . The mother presides over all with a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now and then putting a revealing question , all the while keeping a watchful eye upon the visitors ' plates lest they should come near being empty . The talk goes back to the old times . But these people talk with difficulty when their theme is themselves . But my interest and questions draw their story from them . Fifteen years ago the father and mother left the cozy Glasgow home and the busy life of that busy city , and came over sea and land with their little girl and baby boy to Winnipeg . There they lived for two years , till with the land-yearning in their hearts they came out from the town to this far-back spot away beyond the Marshes . Here they cut out of the forest their home , and here they have lived amid the quiet , cool woods ever since , remote from the bustle and heat of the great world . " Why to this place instead of to any other ? " I ask . " There was the hay from the Marshes to be sold , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , " he went on , " I could not make much out of the wood , and I was too old to learn , so I gave it up , and went into Winnipeg to work at my trade . And , indeed , " he added cheerfully , " I made very good wages of it . " I look at him and think of the day when he gave up the fight with the wood , and came in beaten to tell his wife how he must go to the city . I know she smiled at him , her heart going down the while , and cheered him , though she was like to despair at the thought of the lonely winter . Ah , the pathos of it ! Did God help them that day ? Ay , and for many a day after . And may He forgive all people whose lives overflow with plenty of everything , and who fret their souls for petty ills . Through the winter the snow piled up round the shanty where lived the little fair-haired woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , thinking , talking , dreaming , weeping , waiting for the spring and the home-coming of the father . One of the horses died , and the other was sold . Their places were taken by oxen . " And the oxen are really very good ; I like to work with the oxen , " says the little man , with heroic Scotch philosophy and invincible content . He can not have the best ; he will make the best of what he can have . Again , may God forgive us who fling down tools because they are not the best , and refuse to work , and fret instead . Those days are all gone , but they are not yet passed out of the life of this family . They have left their stamp on heart and character of these steadfast , gentle people , for they are a part of all that they have met . After tea I am told that I have not yet seen Katie , and the manner of telling makes me feel that there is something in store for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a narrow hall and into another room , spotless as the kitchen , the same white walls , white floor , and dainty curtains . This is Katie 's room , and there upon a bed lies Katie herself . I have come into the heart of the home . Katie is the eldest of the family . She is the little girl of nine that stayed through the long winter with the mother , and helped her with the babies inside and the beasts outside , and was the cheer and comfort of the house , while the father was away in Winnipeg , brave little girl that she was . She is now twenty-four , and for the last nine years she has suffered from a mysterious and painful illness , and now for eighteen months she has lain upon her bed and she can not rise . We all have in us the beast feeling that shrinks from the weak and wounded ; but when I look at Katie there is no shrinking in me . Her face has not a sign of fretful weakness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , of the pewter covers , and the old silver teaspoons . It is bright . That is its characteristic . The broad brow is smooth , and the mouth , though showing the lines of suffering  --  what control these lines suggest !  --  is firm and content . The dark eyes look out from under their straight black brows with a friendly searching . " Come near , " they say ; " are you to be trusted ? " and you know you are being found out . But they are kindly eyes and full of peace , with none of that look in them that shows when the heart is anxious or sore . The face , the mouth , the eyes , tell the same tale of a soul that has left its storms behind and has made the haven , though not without sign of the rough weather without . There is no sick-room feeling here . The coverlet , the sheets , the night-dress , with frills at the breast and wrists  --  everything about Katie is sweet and fresh . Every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshed up a bit " by her mother 's loving hands . It takes an hour to do it , and there are many household cares ; but what an hour that is ! What talk , what gentle , tearful jokes , what tender touches ! The hour is one of sacrament to them both , for He is always there in whose presence they are reverent and glad . We " take the books , " and I am asked to be priest . One needs his holy garments in a sanctuary like this . After the evening worship is over I talk with Katie . " Do n't you feel the time long ? Do n't you grow weary sometimes ? " " No ! Oh , no ! " with slight surprise . " I am content . " " But surely you get lonely  --  blue now and then ? " " Lonely ? " with the brightest of smiles . " Oh , no ! They are all here . " Heaven forgive me ! I had thought she perhaps might have wanted some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always so ? Did n't you fret at the first ? " I persisted . " No , not at the first . " " That means that bad times came afterwards ? " " Yes , " she answers slowly , and a faint red comes up in her cheek as if from shame . " After the first six months I found it pretty hard . " I wait , not sure what thoughts I have brought to her , and then she goes on : " It was hard to see my mother tired with the work , and Jean could not get to school " ; and she could go no further . " But that all passed away ? " I asked , after a pause . " Oh , yes ! " and her smile says much . It was the memory of her triumph that brought her smile , and it illumined her face . My words came slowly . I could not comfort where comfort was not needed . I could not pity , facing a smile like that ; and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain . But it came to me to say : " He has done much for you ; and you are doing much for Him . " " Yes : He has done much for me . " But she would go no further . Her service seemed small to her , but to me it seemed great and high . We , in our full blood and unbroken life , have our work , our common work , but this high work is not for us  --  we are not good enough . This He keeps for those His love makes pure by pain . This would almost make one content to suffer . Next morning we all went to the little log school , where the Communion service was to be held  --  all but the father and Katie . " You have done me much good , " I could not but say before I left ; " and you are a blessing in your home . " The color rose in her pale cheek , but she only said : " I am glad you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbly and softly , feeling as if I had been in a holy place , where I was not worthy to stand . And a holy place it will ever be to me  --  the white room , the spotless white room , lit by the glory of that bright , sweet , patient face . At the Table that day the mother 's face had the same glory  --  the glory of those that overcome , the reflection of the glory to follow . Happy , blessed home ! The snows may pile up into the bluff and the blizzards sweep over the whistling reeds of the Marshes , but nothing can chill the love or dim the hopes that warm and brighten the hearts in the little log house Beyond the Marshes , for they have their source from that high place where love never faileth and hopes never disappoint . ***
