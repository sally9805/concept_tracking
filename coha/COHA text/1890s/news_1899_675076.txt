txt We wish that we could regard the action of the Committee - on Coinage , in reporting the Hill Currency bin , as good ground for revising our recent expression of opinion that the situation of the sound-money cause is extremely discouraging and in some respects discreditable . But we can not see that it really changes that situation greatly . The bill is a good one , not as good in some respects as the bill abandoned by the Committee on Banking and Currency , but one that would be of immense advantage to the country . It fixes the gold standard openly and in terms ; it makes all the obligations of the Government payable in gold ; it creates a separate division in the Treasury to take in charge all matters of the currency , and provides ample means for it to redeem in gold the United States notes and Treasury notes ; it requires the very gradual , but finally complete . retirement of the United States notes , and it extends somewhat the legal circulation of the National banks , and authorizes smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent , and if the Administration had taken it in hand at the start it would now be accomplished , and the country would have the incalculable benefits involved in it .

" It has not the slightest chance of passing , and must die with the present Congress . The only value that we can recognize in this action of the Republican majority of the Coinage Committee lies in the fact that it is a new pledge . But the country has had many pledges from the Republicans in many ways . It has had no performance . The President has been in office nearly one-half his term . Congress has held three sessions . Not a step has been taken . not a bill has been passed , that adds a particle to the stability or the soundness of the currency or of the standard of value .

It is true that in doing that he would act the part of a statesman and not that of an ordinary politician ; he would almost surely take away the issue which some of his party leaders think the strongest possible one for them , but he would strengthen his party and himself as he could in no other way .
