II . THE MANILA CAMPAIGN . BY FRANCIS V. GREENE , MAJOR-GENERAL U. S. V. ENERAL MERRITT arrived at Cavite in the Newport on the afternoon of July 25 , and after examining the ground the following day , promptly decided two points : first , that the attack would be made along the shore ; and , second , that it was necessary to get the insurgents off to one side , so as to give us the right of way . He was very anxious to avoid any entangling alliances with Agni naldo , with whom he had no direct communication . He therefore sent his chief of staff , on the afternoon of July 28 , with a verbal ; message directing me to persuade the insurgents , if possible , to evacuate a portion of their trenches ; but I was to do this on my own responsibility , and without intimating that I had any instructions to this effect from him . I had previously met General Noriel , // who commanded the brigade of insurgents nearest to the beach , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who spoke Spanish fluently , to find this general and give him a most polite message that I desired to see him on matters of common interest . At the same time the orderly was instructed not to come back without him . He returned in about an hour with General Noriel and his young adjutant-general , Arevolas , both wearing handsome uniforms and equipments . I explained to him that the antique six-inch columbiad which he had in his trench was of an obsolete pattern and very ineffective against the Spanish artillery , and that if he would give up the trenches for about four hundred yards from the beach , I would place in them the fine modern pieces of field-artillery which we had brought , and which would be much more effective against the Spaniards . He received the idea favorably , but said he could do nothing without consulting Aguinaldo ; and I requested him to do this by telegraph ( Aguinaldo 's headquarters being about eleven miles in the rear ) , and give me an answer during the night . He promised to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having been obliged to ride back through the rain and mud to Bacoor to see Aguinaldo , as the answer by telegraph was not satisfactory . He said that Aguinaldo had given his consent , provided I would make the request in writing . I told him that I had no objection to this , but , in order to save time , I would post the troops in the trenches early in the morning , and send the written request as soon thereafter as possible . This arrangement was carried out , and at eight o'clock in the morning one battalion of the Eighteenth Regular Infantry , one battalion of the First Colorado Volunteers , and four guns , two from each of the Utah light batteries , were at the trenches nearest to the beach , and these were surrendered without any protest by the insurgents . The trench which had been constructed by the latter was of insufficient profile and not well located . I decided to construct another trench about one hundred and twentyfive yards in advance , and this work was undertaken immediately , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor . The Spaniards apparently did not notice that it was being constructed by our troops instead of by the insurgents , and no serious opposition was made . On the following morning the Eighteenth Infantry and the First Colorado were re lieved by two battalions of the First California . The trenches were already of sufficient height to enable the change to be made without the men being seen by the Spaniards . The work of intrenching continued without abatement during the day and night , and on the morning of the 811 st the California battalions were relieved by two battalions of the Tenth Pennsylvania and one company ( nearly two hundred men ) of the Third Regular Artillery . They also kept on intrenching , for the third day , without any interruption from the Spaniards further than occasional picket-firing . The labor of digging these trenches was very great , and the results accomplished were comparatively so slight that they would have been discouraging if the troops had not been in such enthusiastic spirits . The soil was a black loam , nearly saturated with water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down almost as fast as it was thrown up . There was a large number of sand-bags on the transport which had brought General Merritt ; but it had been impossible to unload this transport as yet , and it was not feasible to get at the sand-bags until a day or two later . Bamboo poles were cut and used for revetments with considerable success , and by the evening of July 31 quite a strong line had been completed from the beach to the highroad and slightly beyond it  --  a total distance of about three hundred yards . The growth of these trenches , in plain view of Fort San Antonio , barely a thousand yards away , had doubtless at last convinced the Spaniards that the work was being carried on by American troops , and not by the insurgents . On the night of July 31-August 1 they made a determined effort to drive us out . They opened with a very heavy fire of both infantry and artillery shortly before midnight . The night was intensely dark , and the rain was falling in torrents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned the fire , aiming at the line of flashes , which indicated the Spanish trenches , about one thousand yards in length . The noise was plainly beard in camp , and the regiments were all under arms in a few minutes , and the commanding officers reported for instructions . One company of the Third Artillery was in reserve in rear of the trenches , and it promptly moved forward , sending back word that it had done so . The other company of the Third Artillery was ordered forward , but before the order could reach them they had // aireadyleft camp . The First California was sent forward , one battalion to the trenches , the second to halt in reserve about twelve hundred yards in rear of them , and the third battalion just in rear of the second , and out of range of the Spanish fire . The First Colorado was similarly sent forward , to halt by battalions in rear of the First California , just outside of the range of fire . The other regiments were held under arms in camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the defensive ; and as the troops advancing to the trenches had to pass through a zone of about seven hundred yards of fire , I was desirous not to send forward any more than were necessary to hold the position . The only place from which any view of the fight could be obtained was on the beach immediately opposite camp . Here the signal-station had been established , and was in communication with the United States steamship Boston , anchored about fifteen hundred yards from the shore . I had consulted with Captain Wildes the previous day , and he had stated that he would open fire whenever I requested him to do so , but that the admiral was very anxious that this should not be done , unless absolutely necessary , until after the arrival of the Monterey . Under these circumstances I was reluctant to signal for the assistance of the Boston unless satisfied that the SpanMAJOR-GENERAL WESLEY MERRITT. // THE CENTURY MAGAZINE , lards were advancing in overwhelming force . I watched the flashes of their guns through a pair of strong glasses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , and finally became satisfied that these flashes Were stationary and were not advancing ; and therefore I decided not to make any signal to the Boston . Meanwhile messengers had come back from the front stating that the losses Were heavy , and that the troops were nearly out of ammunition but that not an inch of the trenches had been yielded . Fresh supplies of ammunition were sent forward in caramattas , and I then rode to the front to see if any more men were needed . The reserve battalions were all found in the Positions to which they had been ordered , quietly lying down in the wet grass and waiting forfurther instructions . The men in the trenches were all in good spirits , and being placed at the rate of more than two per yard , there was no room for any more , The officers expressed entire confidence in their ability to hold the line . Temporary field-hospitals had been established in the native huts at intervals on the way back to camp . The fresh ammuni tion had all been received and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of the ponies had been shot , Everything was in good order . The firing had begun to slacken just as I reached the trenches , and not long afterward it virtually ceased , and word was sent back to part of the reserves to return to camp . The principal losses had been in one battalion of the Tenth Pennsylvanj* under command of THE FIRST NESRASKA MARCHING UP THE BEACH TOWARD MANILA . ( SEE PAGR 928 . ) FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY H W PETEAS CONVENT BUILDING AND INTRENCHMENT , USED BY THE AMERICANS This Convent San d between Camp was sitnate Dewey and the Spanish Fort Antonio , ( See maps , pages iii , 923. ) // Major Cuthbertson , which had been sent beyond the trenches on the right in anticipation of a flank attack from that direction . The Spanish line was about three times as long as our own , and completely overlapped our right , so that there was ground for this apprehension . Major Cuthbertson was , in fact , convinced that the Spaniards had attempted to turn his flank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this he was mistaken , for if such had been the fact the ground would have been covered with Spanish dead and wounded . He was partly led to this belief by the curious sound of the bullets penetratimg the bamboo poles , which could hardly be distinguished from the crack of the Mauser rifle . I remained in the trenches for nearly an hour , during which time the Spanish fire hadcompletelyceased , and apparently there was no intention of renewing it . I then returned to camp , stopping to visit the temporary hospitals , and to send back the battalions which had gone forward in reserve . The day broke soon after I returned , the rain still falling in torrents . Compared with the battles of the Civil War , this was an unimportant skirmish . Without leaving their own trenches , the Spaniards poured the hottest possible fire on our trenches for about two hours , with the intention of driving us out . Our men stood firm . Reserves were ordered up , passing through nearly half a mile of hot fire before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attempt to drive us out failed , and the firing ceased . That was all . There was no manzeuvering , no advancing ; no display of tactical skill9 and no opportunity for it . During the long winter of 1864-65 similar events took place in front of Petersburg several times in every month , and they are hardly recorded in the voluminous&gt; records of the Civil War . Yet this fight was of great importance to us , for many reasons . We were seven thousand miles from the nearest point of America , engaged on a foreign soil , without any land transportation , and without any place to retreat to if we had been driven out . Of the five thousand men in camp , about one fourth of whom were engaged , not more than fifty had ever before been under fire or in the vicinity of a battle . The night was so dark that it was impossible to see ten feet ; every one was soaked to the skin with the extraordinary downpour of rain , and a gale of wind was blowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been prepared , yet it was impossible to consult a map in the darkness and rain , and equally impossible to find one 's way anywhere except on the highroad . All the conditions were such as usually create consternation among green troops ; yet the veterans of one hundred battles of the Civil War could not have done more thoroughly what was required that night than did those young men fromPennsylvaniaand California , Colorado and Utah , and from the various States whose men were found in the Third Regular Artillery . There was no confusion and no unnecessary excitement , and the simple result of the fight was that we held the trenches in accordance with our instructions , and lost ten killed and fortythree wounded . The effect on the men was very striking . During the previous week I had had to establish a close line of sentinels about twelve hundred yards in rear of our trenches , with strict orders to allow no one to pass to the front unless he had written instructions . This had to be done to prevent the men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering up the beach and along the road , so as to get in sight of the Spanish trenches , draw their fire , and come back EMILIO AGUINALDO. // to camp and tell their comrades what it was like . After this fight there was no further need for these sentinels ; everybody sobered to the reality of the situation . The brigade hospital was full of wounded ; the there was serious business in hand . The expression on the men 's faces changed . There was no evidence of shrinking or fear , but the inconsequent laughter was replaced by a look of seriousness and determination . MAJOR-GENERAL FRANCIS V. GREENE . From a sketch made in Camp Dewey , near Manila , Augast 10 , 1898. operating-tables were in constant use , and blood-stained bandages were being taken out from the tents to be washed in the rain . Up to that time the irrepressible idea that the whole thing was more or less of a picnic had prevailed throughout the regiments ; but from that time on every one realized that Yet there was no disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its turn to go to the trenches ; and if any individual work of hazardous reconnoitering was on hand , there were dozens of competent men eager and anxious to undertake it . DRAWN BR S. W. PETERS . // No soldier can ever belittle the enormous advantages , or deny the absolute necessity , of discipline . But if well-trained and disciplined troops are not to be had , the next best thing is volunteers inspired with such superb enthusiasm as characterized every one of these regiments . With men thus animated it needs only competent officers and leaders to overcome every obstacle . General Merritt had watched from his transport the firing during the night , and before I could send a report to him in the morning , an officer of his staff arrived in camp to ascertain the result . It was for General Merritt to determine whether a counter-attack should be made , and for me to carry out his orders . But I considered very carefully what would be the probable result in case he ordered an attack , and I have never entertained any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have attacked and carried the Spanish trenches and captured Manila on the morning after this fight ; but in doing so our losses would have been between twenty and thirty per cent . of those engaged . General Merritt , however , had no such plans in mind . He had no intention of making an attack until everything was in readiness . General MacArthur , with nearly four thousand men , had arrived the previous day , and General Merritt desired to land these troops and get them in position before bringing on a general engagement . He also desired to have the full cooperation of the navy , and it was thought necessary to give forty-eight hours ' notice of bombardment . The admiral was not willing to give this notice until the arrival of the monitors , or at least one of them . General Merritt 's instructions to me were , therefore , not only to remain on the defensive , but not even to answer the enemy 's fire . His experience in the Civil War had convinced him that nothing is gained by picket-firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spaniards would , in turn , cease their fire . On the morning of August 1 the First Colorado took its turn in the trenches , and the commanding officer was strictly ordered not to return the fire under any circumstances , unless the Spaniards actually advanced against our trenches with a strong force . It was not very easy to carry out these instructions , for nothing is more trying for troops than to sit still under fire ; and in the darkness it was very difficult to determine whether the Spaniards were advancing . Still , the instructions were very VOL . LVIJ. - 117. fairly carried out . The Spaniards opened fire with both infantry and artillery , about a quarter after nine in the evening , and kept it up something over an hour . Colonel Hale enforced strict fire discipline ; very little response was made on our side , and our loss was one killed and three wounded . On the following morning ( August 2 ) the Boston was replaced by the Raleigh , at anchor immediately off our camp . Communication was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey to the captain of this vessel . He stated that the admiral was very anxious to avoid a general action , but had instructed him to assist us if I asked it , and in case he went into action another vessel was under orders to support him . He also sent ashore a box of blue lights , and it was agreed that if I burned one of these on the beach he would immediately open fire on Fort San Antonio . The tour in the trenches was taken that day by two battalions of the First Nebraska and one battalion of the Eighteenth Regular Infantry . The Spaniards opened fire at half-past nine . Under the mistaken impression that the Spaniards were advancing , these troops , and particularly the Eighteenth Infantry , fired away a great deal of ammunition . The firing ceased after half an hour or more , and our losses were one killed and seven wounded , all in the Nebraska regiment . On August 3 five companies of the Fourteenth and four companies of the Twentythird Infantry were brought over from Cavite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their cascos was wrecked , and a considerable portion of their rations was lost . That night the Spaniards made no attack . The following day ( August 4 ) the Monterey steamed into the bay and anchored near the flagship . Although she was nearly six miles distant from camp , she was easily identified , and the men lined the beach , watching her . Every one in camp had somehow learned that the beginning of our attack was dependent on her arrival , and they cheered enthusiastically when they saw her drop anchor . General Merritt had sent one of his staff-officers , as usual , to get reports ; and by him I sent back to General Merritt a letter stating that if the Monterey could be sent to anchor at a point opposite Fort San Antonio indicated on the chart , she could demolish this fort the minute it opened fire ; and I asked that this be done . Up to that time we had lost twelve killed and fifty- // FOREIGN FLEET . ? 2 a e ' c* 1. /S . FLEET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0000 the night before , and there had been a slight misunderstanding in regard to it . I asked permission to go over to the flagship and explain the situation in person to the admiral , whom I had had the pleasure of knowing for many years . When I went up the gangway , the officer of the deck told me that the admiral was lying down , and he hardly felt at liberty to disturb him . I was dressed in a cotton uniform , was covered with mud , and perhaps my appearance suggested a tramp rather than an officer . The mud was dropping from my clothes on the spotless deck of the Olympia , and altogether I was not an agreeable visitor . But I told the officer of the deck that I had ridden nine miles through the mud , and had come several miles across the bay in a heavy sea , for the purpose of seeing the admiral , and I must get 8 9 /OMIL*8. back to camp before dark , when the firing would probably be resumed ; so I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took in my message , and was back in an instant , asking me to step into the cabin . Long anxiety had made the admiral subject to insomnia , and he found it difficult to get to sleep before two or three o'clock in the morning . He was always up soon after sunrise , and in order partly to make up for this loss of sleep he was in the habit of lying down in the afternoon . I was extremely sorry to disturb him ; but be received me with the utmost cordiality , and immediately spread out his charts on the table , and explained in great detail his plans for the attack , and what part each vessel was to take in it . He said he fully realized how difficult it was for our men to incur losses under the enemy 's fire and not reply to it , but that these losses would be far less POSITIONS OF TEE FLEET AND OF TEE UNITED STATES AND SPANISH FORCES BEFORE TEE ASSAULT . two wounded while complying with our instructions to remain strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navy , with their superior artillery , to put a stop to this loss of life , and I considered it my duty to present the facts fully to my superior officer for his consideration . After that my responsibility ceased , and I had nothing to do but to carry out loyally whatever orders I received . Early the next morning ( August 5 ) General Merritt sent me word over the field-telegraph , which had just been established , to come immediately to Bacoor . I rode back as rapidly as possible , on a small native pony , along the almost impassable road . General Merritt was in a launch off the beach at Bacoor , and took me to his transport . He had sent my letter to the admiral FORT SANTONIO ABAD . I B 3 4 5 // in the end than those which might be incurred in a premature attack . The Spaniards had four nine-inch guns in or near the Luneta , and he was not willing to engage his ships until the arrival of the monitors , which could silence these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army was not ready ; for , on account of the prevailing storm , hardly any of General MacArthur 's troops had yet been landed . He knew that General Merritt did not wish to attack until these troops were ashore . He and General Merritt were in perfect accord as to the propriety of postponing the attack until everything was in readiness ; then he was satisfied it could be carried out with very slight loss . He suggested the possibility of withdrawing my men from the trenches , but he was quickly convinced that this was not to be considered . Asto using the Monterey against the Spanish lines , he said this was not desirable at the moment , because after her voyage of seven thousand miles across the Pacific some slight repairs to her machinery were necessary before going into action ; and he was extremely averse to using for this purpose any of his other ships , which were unarmored and might be destroyed by a well-directed fire . Therefore , if we could not withdraw from the trenches , it was better for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trenches , rather than to run the risk of greater losses in a premature attack . " But , " he added , " the decision rests with you . If you burn the blue light on the beach , the Raleigh will immediately open fire , the Charleston will go to her assistance , and the Boston and the Monterey will follow if the engagement continues . All of these ships have steam up every night , and these orders have been given to their captains ; but I hope you will not burn the blue light unless you are on the point of being driven out . " I assured him that there was little danger of that . I went back to the Newport and reported the conversation to General Merritt ; told him of the very cordial messages which the admiral had sent , and that there was no difference of opinion between them . The admiral had expressed a desire to see him in the morning , either on the Newport or the Olympia , as best suited his convenience . General Merritt said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was to be no change in his instructions to me : we must remain on the defensive , not answer the fire , and not burn the blue light unless in imminent danger of being driven out of our trenches . I told him that this was an almost impossible contingency . I then went ashore , and rode through the mud to camp , arriving there soon after dark .

Firing began at half-past seven and lasted until ten . As usual , the mistake was made of thinking the Spaniards were advancing , and our men fired away nearly twenty thousand rounds . Our losses were three killed and seven wounded . After General Merritt had talked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 6 ) , he returned to his transport , and wrote to the admiral , proposing that they should send a joint letter to the Spanish captain-general , stating that at the end of forty-eight hours , or sooner if the attacks on us continued , an attack by the American land and naval forces might take place , and that the notice was given in order to afford an opportunity to remove all non-combatants from the city . The admiral replied , accepting the proposition , and a letter to this effect was prepared the following morning , signed jointly , and sent into Manila on one of the naval launches . The captain-general replied , expressing thanks for the humane sentiments which had been shown in the letter , and stating that , as he was surrounded by insurrectionary forces , he was without places of refuge for the increased numbers of wounded , sick , women , and children who were then lodged within the walls . The effect of this notice was to put a stop to the firing upon us . Not a shot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery of this letter and our attack on Manila . General MacArthur 's brigade , as already stated , had arrived on July 31 . The Astor Battery was the first to land . They came ashore on the beach opposite the camp . One of their cascos was capsized , their ammunition was ruined , and some of their rations were lost . A day or two passed in waiting in vain for the storm to subside , and on August 5 a landing was attempted at the mouth of the Paranaque River , the men being placed in the boats of the transports , which were towed by the navy launches . One boat was upset , but fortunately the men were rescued , and on the whole the landing was a success . It was continued in the same manner on the 6th , 7th , and 8th , and on the morning of the 9th MacArthur 's force was ashore and encamped . Late on the night of the 6th General MacArthur himself came ashore . Our commissions were of the same date , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army and I was a colonel of volunteers . On the other hand , he had had thirty-two years of service in the regular army , and I had had only twenty . Under the ruling of the War Department , he was the senior , and I reported to him for orders . With the utmost courtesy , he expressed a desire that I should continue to exercise the command until he became fully acquainted with the situation , and said that he would detail his regiments for their tour in the trenches , and direct them to report to me for instructions . I suggested that if he desired to reconnoiter the Spanish lines , I should like to accompany him ; and on the 8th of August we spent the greater part of the day in making this examination . Although General MacArthur had served with great distinction through the Civil War , he said he had never met a military situation of more difficulty , owing to the nature of the ground over which we had to operate . As we waded through the swamps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not avoid laughing at the comic side of the situation , and saying how little he had dreamed , when he commanded a regiment as a young man , that more than thirty years later he would be engaged in war on the opposite side of the globe , and under such novel circumstances . This , however , was only for a moment . He fully appreciated the serious nature of the business in hand , and quickly grasped the tactical situation . He was good enough to say that he had no changes to make in the positions I had selected , or in the trenches which had been constructed , and which were now more than double the length of those which had existed when we were attacked on the night of July 31 . They now extended from the beach on the left , a distance of three quarters of a mile , to an extensive rice swamp on the right , both flanks being protected by virtually impassable obstacles . On our return to camp , we found General Merritt waiting for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to him , a plan of attack . Our views were in entire accord , and we made our report on the following day ( August 9 ) , stating that we considered it an indispensable preliminary to success that the insurgent trenches in front of blockhouse No. 14 should be occupied by the troops of the First Brigade , and that these trenches should be enlarged and strengthened , and emplacements made for artillery , so as to provide for a vigorous assault upon this blockhouse . We thought we could probably persuade General Noriel to vacate these // intrenchments , or , if he declined to do so , we could easily remove the small number of insurgents who occupied them . General Merritt sent his chief of staff , General Babcock , to see us on the following day , and to state that we might ask the insurgent generals for permission to occupy these trenches ; but if refused , we must not use force , and must not on any account have a rupture with the insurgents ; moreover , there must be no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opinion , bring about partial engagements , resulting in further loss , prior to the general assault . We sent back a written memorandum to the effect that we could hold the trenches against any possible attack , and could occupy them on two hours ' notice preparatory to an assault ; but that we did not recommend a determined attack without first getting possession of the trenches in front of blockhouse No. 14 . We also sent detailed information which he called for concerning effective strength , ammunition on hand , rations , etc . On the afternoon of the 10th , General Anderson , who commanded the division consisting of MacArthur 's and my brigades , and whose headquarters had hitherto been at Cavite , arrived in camp , and personally assumed command . Meanwhile the forty-eight hours ' notice of bombardment had expired at noon on August 9 . At that hour all the foreign ships left their anchorage off Manila and moved out of range across the bay . Numbers of tugs and small steamers came out of the Pasig River , carrying foreigners and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on buildings in various sections of the city , and the inhabitants evidently anticipated that the bombardment would begin . In place of this , General Merritt and Admiral Dewey sent in a joint note to the Spanish captain-general making a formal demand for surrender , calling attention to his helpless condition , and to the inevitable suffering in store for the wounded , sick , women , and children , in case it became necessary to reduce the defenses of the walled town in which they were gathered . The captain-general replied , stating that he had assembled the council of defense , which declared that the request for surrender could not be granted ; but he asked permission to consult the government , if the time strictly necessary for communicating by way of Hong-Kong were granted . This request was declined by General Merritt and the admiral on the morning of the 10th . Preparations were then made for the assault , and on the 11th General Merritt came to camp for final consultation . On the 12th he sent his instructions , and the necessary orders were immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been arranged by General Merritt and Admiral Dewey , between whom there was the most cordial feeling and hearty cooperation , that the navy was to leave its anchorage at Cavite at nine o'clock on the morning of August 13 , move up to the different positions assigned to the ships , and open fire about ten o'clock . The ships were not to fire at the town , but at Fort San Antonio and the trenches extending eastward from it , which they could enfilade . At the same time the field-artillery on shore was to fire against the front of the fort and the trenches . The troops were to be assembled partly in the trenches and partly in reserve , all prepared to move forward at the proper time . After the bombardment had continued for a sufficient length of time , it was the intention of the admiral to move up toward the walled city in the Olympia , and display the international signal , " Surrender . " If this was answered by a white flag on the city walls , the troops were to advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the bombardment did not compel a surrender , the question of assault was to be decided by the commanding general , whose headquarters were on the transport Zafiro , where he could get a good view of the action , and from which he would communicate his orders by signal to our trenches . Under these instructions , General Anderson placed General MacArthur 's brigade on the right , and directed him to occupy the insurgent trenches in front of blockhouse No. 14 with five battalions , keeping six in reserve , and instructed me to occupy the trenches on the left , extending for a distance of about seven hundred yards from the beach , placing seven battalions in the trenches and keeping eight in reserve . The reserve was to be stationed under his own direction at the Pasay cross-road . Seven guns of the Utah batteries were placed at intervals in the trenches of my brigade ; in addition , three guns lent by the navy , and manned by a volunteer detachment of the Third Artillery , were placed on the extreme right of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns of the Astor Battery were posted with MacArthur 's brigade on the extreme right . Reconnaissance work was continued up to the last moment , and every night small // parties were out , crawling through the grass , and following every road and lane , until every foot of the ground , to within a few yards of the Spanish lines , had been examined and was accurately known to us . This information had been placed on a map , a copy of which was given to each battalion commander . Finally , on the second day before the assault , Major Bell of General Merritt 's staff , who had been assigned to temporary duty with me , crawled into the water on his hands and knees , and definitely ascertained not only that the stream in front of Fort San Antonio was fordable at its mouth , but the exact width of the ford . He was only one hundred and fifty yards from the fort , and his head could be seen above water by numbers of the Spanish troops who lined the parapet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act that from sheer admiration they refused to fire on him , or whether they feared that if they opened fire the city would be bombarded , in accordance with the notice of August 7 , was never ascertained , but in fact they did not fire upon him . The last reconnaissance was made at midnight on the 12th , when a small party of the First Colorado Regiment , led by Captain Grove and Lieutenant Means , succeeded in penetrating to a line of barbed-wire fence about one hundred yards from Fort San Antonio , and cutting it with nippers . While General Merritt 's instructions left it uncertain whether a determined assault would be made , yet the orders of the division and brigade commanders were all drawn with that end in view . The camp was left standing under guard of two men to a company , and a small signal-station was left on the beach . All other men , except the wounded and sick , went forward . Each carried his rifle , bayonet , belt , haversack , canteen , and two hundred rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .45-caliber Springfield , this made a heavy load for them to carry ; but the experience in our night fighting had shown that even two hundred rounds disappear very quickly . Had these regiments been armed with the .30-caliber gun their load would have been reduced about one third . In addition to ammunition , every man carried two days ' rations of meat and hard bread , and his mess-kit . The front-rank men filled their canteens with coffee , and the rear-rank men with water . All spades , shovels , axes , and hatchets in the possession of the regiments were distributed uniformly to the companies , so that each set of fours had at least one intrenching-tool , and there was one hatchet or ax in each section , and one pick in each platoon . The small number of wire-cutters on hand were distributed so as to give one to each first sergeant . Caramatta trains were organized to carry forward ammunition and bring back the wounded to the temporary hospitals , the location of which was indicated in the orders . In case an assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive battalions in the extended-order formation prescribed in the drill regulations , each regiment covering the front of one battalion , and the distance between battalions to be about two hundred yards . The objective of'each regiment was clearly specified in the orders , and stringent instructions were given not to waste ammunition by firing into thickets and in the general direction of the enemy , but to fire only when the enemy or his trenches could be plainly seen . The reserve was to be used only by the division commander , or , in his absence , by the brigade commander . The morning of August 13 opened , as usual , with thick clouds and a heavy rain . Reveille was sounded at four o'clock , so that the men could get into the trenches before daylight and thus escape observation by the Spaniards . It was a dreary morning as the long columns of heavily loaded men picked their way through the mud to the trenches . They were all in position before eight o'clock . A few minutes after nine o'clock the squadron was seen moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine it fired the first shot . Our field-artillery immediately opened . The firing of the navy was not as accurate ason the 1st of May . On that day they had a bright sun ; on August 13 the gusts of rain made it difficult for them to see their target at ranges of from three to four thousand yards . On the other hand , the firing from the Utah battery , in the trenches , was remarkably accurate . Their range was barely a thousand yards , and the rain did not prevent their seeing the fort . They were instructed to aim just below the crest of the parapet , and their shooting was so accurate as to make the parapet *ntirely untenable . As the squadron approached within shorter range their firing improved , and many of their shots took effect ; one of them in particular , a six- or eight-inch shell , passed through the wall of the fort , about three feet in thickness , and exploded in the magazine , completely destroying it . The Callao , a captured gunboat , was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was armed with one-pound Hotchkiss rapid-fire guns , and a constant stream of these small projectiles was poured on the fort . On the other flank of the squadron was the Monterey with her great twelve-inch guns . She was to take no part unless the Spaniards opened fire with their four nine-inch guns in the batteries on the Luneta and in front of the walls ; then she was to silence them . These guns , however , were right in the range between the Monterey 's position and the walled city . A shot from the Monterey , if it missed the heavy batteries , would land in the heart of the most thickly populated portion of the city . The Spaniards did not fire their heavy guns , nor did they answer the bombardments of Fort San Antonio and the trenches in any way . General Babcock , the chief of staff , had been sent ashore by General Merritt , and joined me at the " convent , " about the middle of our trenches , at nine o'clock . He brought instructions , changing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to send forward one regiment as soon as the bombardment had produced any effect , and without waiting for the admiral to display his signal , " Surrender . " This regiment was to make a feint or a real attack , according to the amount of resistance which it encountered . After delivering his instructions , General Babcock went to the signal-station , which had been constructed in an old hulk on the beach at the end of our trenches . This was connected by the field telegraph-wire with the " convent , " as well as with General Anderson 's and General MacArthur 's headquarters . At ten minutes after ten o'clock I sent forward one battalion of the First Colorado , followed by the second and third battalions of the same regiment , telegraphing this fact to General Babcock , so that he could signal to the navy to cease firing , and also to General Anderson , so that he could send forward one regiment from the reserve to take the place of the First Colorado . The advance of the First Colorado was made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our trenches , and partly along the beach and in the water . It was plainly seen from the ships and greeted with cheers . As they went forward , the Spaniards for the first time began firing . As they had smokeless powder , the direction of this fire could be judged only from the sound of the rifles and the whistle of the bullets . It appeared to come from the woods in the rear of their trenches and a few hundred yards back from the shore . Without paying much attention to it , the Colorado regiment pushed rapidly forward , crossed the stream at the ford near its mouth , and dashing through the water on the beach beyond the flank of the Spanish intrenchments , they rushed around behind the fort , and entered this from the rear . I had given Adjutant Brooks an American flag just as he left the trenches . LieutenantColonel McCoy was with the first battalion , and was at the head of the party which entered the fort . He immediately hauled down the Spanish flag and hoisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ships and the trenches . General MacArthur 's brigade , as already stated , was to be formed for attack on the road leading from Pasay to blockhouse No. 14 . His front was very narrow , between impassable rice swamps on each side . Moreover , General Merritt 's instructions not to have any rupture with the insurgents , and not to construct any fresh trenches , which might bring on more partial engagements , had prevented him from making desirable arrangements for the advance of his troops . He was obliged , therefore , to form them in detachments behind stone walls and houses , on each side of the road , at intervals all the way from Pasay to within about two hundred yards of blockhouse No. 14 . They were all in position before nine o'clock : the Astor Battery on the right of the road , one Utah gun in an insurgent emplacement on the road , the Thirteenth Minnesota on the right , and the Twenty-third Regulars on the left , his remaining battalions being in the reserve . From his position he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not see the ships or my trenches . He heard the bombardment on the left , then the infantry firing , saw the Spanish flag hauled down , and heard the cheering which followed . He then gave the order to open fire on blockhouse No. 14 , which was only two hundred yards in front of his advance . The Astor Battery and the Utah gun brought a converging cross-fire on this blockhouse and quickly riddled it ; whereupon the Thirteenth Minnesota rushed forward and captured it , part of the garrison in the blockhouse and adjacent trenches being captured , and the rest escaping into the woods in the rear . He then advanced along the road to blockhouse No. 13 , which took fire , and as it burned , several thousands of small-arms cartridges exploded . The Thirteenth Minnesota advanced along the road to Singalong , the Astor Battery dragging their mountain guns // by hand along the road and over the barricades , and keeping in the firing line . The Twenty-third Infantry advanced along a parallel road leading into the woods to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . these woods , but not enough to check their advance until they reached the cross-roads at Singalong . Here they met a very hot fire from a fortified house at the bend of the road , about two hundred yards north of Singalong . Of this house we had no previous knowledge , as it was over eight hundred yards within the Spanish outer line , and concealed by trees in the fiat country . There was a church , with stone walls about the yard , at the Singalong crossroads ; and while the men were being formed for assault under the shelter of these walls , Captain Sawtelle of General MacArthur 's staff made a daring reconnaissance up the road , under a very hot fire , to ascertain the nature of the obstructions . As soon as he made his report , volunteers were called for from the Astor Battery and the Thirteenth Minnesota , and , led by Captain Sawtelle and Lieutenant March of the Astor Battery , these rushed up the road . At their approach the Spaniards fled , making their escape through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walled city . This terminated the fighting in MacArthur 's brigade . It had lasted about three hours , and his losses had been seven killed and thirty wounded . On the other flank , near the beach , as soon as I saw the Spanish flag hauled down and ours raised over Fort San Antonio , I ordered the Eighteenth Infantry and the Third Artillery to move forward , in accordance with their previous instructions , on the right of the Calle Real and against the trenches between Fort San Antonio and blockhouse No. 14 . At the same time I telegraphed to General Anderson , stating the situation briefly , and asking him to send forward the rest of the reserves . I then rode forward rapidly along the beach and through the creek to Fort San Antonio . The Eighteenth Infantry and the Third Artillery advanced in extended order , and soon after leaving the trenches were met by a sharp infantry fire from the woods in the rear of the Spanish trenches and in the direction of Singalong . They answered this by volleys as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trenches without further opposition . As in Fort San Antonio , the trenches were deserted , except for a few dead and wounded . By twelve o'clock , therefore , the entire Spanish line from Fort San Antonio to blockhouse No. 13 had been carried , and the navy , of course , had ceased firing some time before . The First Colorado , and the First California , which had followed rapidly up the beach , were in the houses and gardens at the southern end of the Malate suburb ; the Eighteenth Infantry , followed by the Third Artillery , was moving by the flank through the Spanish trenches toward the same point . The other regiments which had been in reserve were coming forward by the Calle Real and along the beach . A sharp fire was now opened on us from the houses in Malate in our front , and from the woods toward Singalong on our right flank . It was difficult to locate the latter accurately , on account of the woods and the lack of smoke , and there was no recourse but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came . By these means it was subdued after about half an hour . The houses in Malate from which the firing came were stormed by parties of volunteers from the First California , who rushed into the houses and killed or captured their defenders . In the open square about the Malate church I halted and reformed the regiments , and then moved forward through the village , the Eighteenth Infantry and First California on the main street , the First Colorado in the parallel street on the right , and the First Nebraska in the shallow water on the beach on the left . The Caiiao kept abreast of the head of column , and within three hundred yards of the shore , her machine-guns ready to play in case there was any firing from the houses . The Third Artillery and the Tenth Pennsylvania ( the latter reaiment having been in the trenches the previous twenty-four hours ) followed on the main street . As we advanced there was occasional firing from the street-corners and houses , as well as from the woods on our right flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open space , known as the Luneta , north of the Ermita suburb . Here the firing from the right flank became very sharp , and this notwithstanding the fact that a **27;218;TOOLONG flying on the southwest bastion of the walled city . I galloped forward to this bastion , and asked the Spanish officer for an explanation . He said he did not know whether the fire came from the insurgents , who had advanced in large numbers on the road from Paco just after the close of MacArthur 's fight at Singalong , or whether it came from the Spanish garrison of Santa Ana , which had retreated // along the same road before the insurgents . While we were talking , the troops were debouching from the streets of the Ermita suburb , forming in extended order to advance across the open space of the Luneta , and answering this fire by volleys . They were in such large numbers that the opposing fire ceased . The troops then moved by the road through the Luneta and along the front of the walls to the point where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer ditch . On the bridge spanning this ditch I found Captain O'Connor , a sturdy old veteran of the Civil War , with his company ( H ) *f the Twentythird Infantry . In the advance past blockhouse No. 14 he was on the left flank of his battalion , and became separated from it . He continued to advance in the direction of the walled city , following by-paths and lanes , meeting no enemy in his front , but subjected constantly to cross-fire on both flanks , through which he had passed without any casualties . He had finally brought up at the walled city in advance of any other troops , and he there reported to me for orders . In the Paco road , just outside the ditch , were two Spanish battalions which had retreated from Santa Ana , but had been halted by Captain O'Connor , and told that he could not allow them to enter the city until he received authority . On the main walls behind the inner ditch were about five thousand Spanish soldiers with guns in their hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white flag was flying over the bastion nearest the beach . It was a novel situation , and somewhat critical . My instructions from General Merritt , in case I did not meet serious resistance , were to push forward rapidly through the suburbs , not to enter the walled city , but to move around by the broad avenue on the east of it to the iron bridge , cross the Pasig , and occupy the thickly populated suburbs on the north of the river , hoist the American flag in as many places as possible , and quickly dispose my troops so as to prevent any pillage . General MacArthur had been similarly instructed , after reaching Singalong , to occupy the southern suburbs of Ermita and Malate and the bridges near Paco . It was now about a quarter after two o'clock , and while the white flag had been flying over the bastion for some time , since it had been raised we had met a very sharp fire . I had no definite knowledge that a surrender had been agreed upon , and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , leaving so large an armed force in my rear VOL . LVIL-118. after I had reached the northern section of the city . While I was debating whether it might not be best , notwithstanding my instructions , to enter the walled city through the gates , forcibly or otherwise , a Spanish aide-de-camp came out in a carriage , and asked if I could not stop the firing which they had heard , as negotiations for surrender were in progress within the walls . Leaving the senior officer in command , with instructions not to fire unless he was fired upon , and to keep the troops where they were until further instructions , I jumped into this carriage , and told the Spanish aide-de-camp to drive me as rapidly as possible to the captain-general 's , so that I could ascertain definitely whether there was going to be a surrender or not . In a few moments we reached the handsome ayuntamiento , or city hall , in one of the beautiful rooms of which I found the late captain-general Augustin , the new acting governor-general Jaudenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , and Lieutenant Brumby of Admiral Dewey 's staff . These officers were all in handsome , fresh uniforms , and presented a striking contrast to the muddy , bedraggled appearance of myself and the aide I had brought with me . We had had nothing to eat since four o'clock in the morning , and as I came into the room I began to feel exhausted . I could not refrain from asking if there was available a bit of something to eat or drink , to which the captaingeneral replied , with profuse apology , that this was the city hall , and there was nothing to be had there , although he would take pleasure in sending to his house for something , if I could wait . I told him there was not time , and my aide then produced from his haversack a few pieces of hardtack and a flask of good American whisky . Politeness compelled them to partake of these , although I fear they were not to their taste . After this slight refreshment I read very carefully the preliminary articles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's consideration , and which were under discussion with the American staff-officers when I entered . I was satisfied , from what I knew of General Merritt 's intentions , that he would accept these , with some possible modifications ; and after leaving with Colonel Whittier a brief note for General Merritt explaining the situation outside the walls , I returned to the carriage , and drove rapidly to the gate through which I had entered . During my absence the troops in the rear // had all come up , and the whole brigade was massed just under the walls where the Paco road meets them . During the same time a body of two or three thousand insurgents had managed to cross the Paco bridge beyond MacArthur 's right flank , and making their way through side-roads and by-paths , had come around and massed themselves on the avenue between my troops and the river . General Babcock , the chief of staff , called my attention to them as soon as I arrived , and stated that their numbers were increasing every minute . They stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurgent flag at their head . I rode up to the officer in command , and requested him to move to one side . This he declined to do , stating that his intention was to enter the city with us . I told him that this was impossible ; but he stood firm . It would have been very awkward if a conflict had been precipitated , for the walls were covered with Spanish troops only a few feet from us , and if firing broke out they would probably take part in it . With the insurgents in front , and the Spaniards behind fortifications in our rear , we would have been in a bad box if fighting had begun . I decided to try to handle them in the way that mobs are handled in large cities ; and bringing up the leading regiment , the First Nebraska , I formed it in column of companies in close order , and putting the men at " port arms , " wheeled each company in succession to the right , and pushed the insurgents bodily into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seemed to be overawed by this unexpected movement , and by the enormous size , compared with themselves , of the Nebraska men , and they offered no resistance . The whole twelve companies of the Nebraska regiment , each nearly one hundred strong , were wheeled out in this way and left behind , facing our right flank , with instructions to allow no insurgents to pass . The other regiments then moved forward in column , and I crossed the iron bridge , sending the regiments alternately to right and left , each with a map and staff-officer to designate the section of the city it was to occupy and guard . As I crossed the bridge the final act of treachery on the part of the Spaniards took place , in burning and sinking a large transport in the Pasig River . On arriving in the northern suburbs , we found the streets filled with people , and all the shops tightly closed ; but there was no attempt at disorder . The British flag was flying from nearly every house , doubtless with the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight on the north side of the river , and this was on the river-quay , about half a mile below the bridge . I immediately proceeded to that point , and found that it was at the office of the captain of the port . I had this hauled down and the American flag run up in its place , giving the poor captain , who pleaded with tears in his eyes that this might cost him his life , a paper stating that the flag was hauled down against his protest and by superior force . It was a part of General Merritt 's plan to bring the Second Oregon Regiment , which had been stationed at Cavite , up on a transport , and to land it in the walled city , as soon as the place should be taken , for the purpose of preserving order there . These troops came into the Pasig River in boats and launches at about five o'clock , and at the same time or a little earlier General Merritt , who had meanwhile received a report from LieutenantColonel Whittier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with certain modifications , the preliminary articles of capitulation submitted by the Spanish captain-general . Immediately after doing this he sent a detachment of the Second Oregon to haul down the large Spanish garrison flag , which floated over the northwest bastion , and run up the American flag in its place . With this the day 's work was done . General MacArthur 's brigade was distributed through the southern suburbs of Ermita and Malate , and my brigade through the northern suburbs of Tondo , Binondo , Santa Cruz , Quiapo , San Sebastian , and San Paloc . The troops slept on the sidewalks during the night , lines of sentinels being posted on all the principal streets . In the morning I moved the lines forward to a series of broad thoroughfares running from the bay at Tondo on the left to the river beyond San Paloc on the right . There was a continuous line of sentinels on these thoroughfares , with strong detachments at each road coming in from the country , and strict orders were given to allow no insurgents to enter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish troops who manned the defenses on the north side of the river , and who were outside of my lines , to abandon their trenches and come in through our lines to the walled city and there lay down their arms . At the same time he appointed a commission , composed of myself and two officers of his staff , to whom an officer of the navy was added by Admiral Dewey , to meet // a similar commission on the part of the Spaniards , and arrange detailed articles of capitulation . We met at nine o'clock on Sunday morning , and finished our work at five in the afternoon . The articles as drawn up by us , and submitted for the consideration of the other side , provided that the Spanish troops should march to a designated point , stack their arms , deposit their flags , sabers , pistols , and other public property , and thence march to quarters to be designated by the United States authority , where they were to remain under the orders of their chiefs , subject to the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty of peace . Officers were to retain their side-arms , horses , and private property , but all public property of every kind , including public funds and funds in the public treasury , was to be turned over to staffofficers designated by the United States . The prisoners of war were to be fed at our expense , but all questions relating to their shipment back to Spain were to be left to the United States government at Washington . The city and its inhabitants , educational establishments , and private property of all kinds , were to be placed under the special safeguard of the faith and honor of the American army , following the lines of Scott 's order on entering the city of Mexico . To this the Spaniards replied , proposing certain minor provisions in regard to the return of Spanish families to Spain , which were readily accepted ; and they proposed a long preamble after the manner of a treaty , which was rejected as unnecessary . They also made another proposal , which was vital ; namely , that their guns should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the event that the United States troops should evacuate Manila . They based this claim upon a paragraph of the preliminary articles , which had been accepted the previous day by General Merritt , to the effect that " all the fighting forces capitulate with the honors of war " ; and they claimed that a capitulation with the honors of war meant that they should have the privilege of marching out with guns in hand , colors flying , and music playing . But in this case this was impossible because they had no place to march to in the interior , and no ships to take them away ; therefore , they asserted , the arms should revert to them on the conclusion of peace . I replied that the preliminary articles provided that the officers would keep their swords , arms , horses , and furniture , but the troops would deposit their arms in a place to be agreed upon ; and as these articles made no provision for the eventual return of the arms , this claim could not be admitted . They declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward deadlock until one of our side suggested that I consult General Merritt , who was in the building . On stating the case to him , he said that in the circumstances he was willing that they should eventually have their arms back . This difficulty being removed , the articles were signed without further delay . In capturing Manila we took thirteen thousand prisoners , or nearly five thousand more than our own force , and twenty-two thousand small arms , ten million rounds of ammunition , about seventy pieces of modern artillery of various calibers , several hundred ancient bronze pieces , an elaborate fortification of the Vauban type with nearly three miles of parapet , an outer line of fielddefenses nearly seven miles in length , a city of about three hundred thousand inhabitants , and nine hundred thousand dollars in public money . This had been done without permitting any pillage or disorder , although the city was filled with natives hostile to its nominal possessors , with whom they had been in strife for many years . As General Merritt says in his report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperate , resolute American soldier , well and skilfully handled by his regimental and brigade commanders , could accomplish . " It was twenty-four days since the first regiment of my brigade had landed near the Spanish trenches , and our total losses had been only twenty killed and one hundred and five wounded , a loss which , all-important as it was to the families of those killed , was totally insignificant in comparison with the results obtained . The navy furnished the artillery , of various calibers , in overwhelming numbers , and mounted on a movable platform , enabling it to move past the enemy 's flank , enfilade his lines , and , if necessary , inflict enormous damage upon the city and its inhabitants ; it also blockaded the city on the water side . The insurgents had furnished a force which , unorganized and poorly equipped as it was , nevertheless was sufficient to capture the waterworks and prevent any food entering the city , thus leaving the population dependent on rain for water , and on such food-supplies as happened to be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without which neither the navy nor the insurgents could have brought the matter to a successful con- // clusion . The small loss incurred was due to the skilful plans of the army commander , General Merritt , who postponed his attack until his plans were completely matured , the ground thoroughly reconnoitered , and his troops all in position , so that the attack could be made in an orderly , systematic manner , overcoming all resistance . Seeing this , the defenders made only a feeble defense , realizing that a stronger one would simply have increased their loss without in any way changing the result .
