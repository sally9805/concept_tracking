txt What , it is charged , was a daring conspiracy to blackmail Samuel Willard Bridgham , a wealthy clubman , came to light yesterday through the news that the Grand Jury had found three indictments against the alleged conspirators . The indictments were returned Thursday , and Recorder Goff issued bench warrants for Lee Hawley , alias " Big " Hawley , alias Woodward ; James Ward , and Eugenia Ward . The warrants were placed in the hands of detectives , but up to last night no arrests had been made . Still other indictments are expected in the case . A suit was brought in the name of James Ward against Mr. Bridgham for $100,000 , Ward charging Mr. Bridgham with having alienated his wife 's affections . Although indictments were found against " Ward " and " Hawley , " they are supposed to be one and the same person . Mr. Bridgham is about forty-five years old and a son-in-law of William C. Schermerhorn . He lives with Mr. Schermerhorn at 49 West Twenty-third Street . On April 23 last Mr. Bridgham was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel , ex-Congressman Franklin Bartlett . Ward 's counsel was James L. Brown of 260 West Twenty-third Street . The complaint was sworn to before Henry alerzbach , an interpreter In the Eighth District Court , at Eighth Avenue and Twenty-third Street . The addresses of Ward and Mrs. Ward were not given . Mr. Bridgham told Mr. Bartlett that the papers must have been meant for some one else , as he did not know the Wards and had never heard of them before . Mr. Bartlett drew up and filed an answer in which a complete denial of all the charges was made . Mr. Bridgham heard nothing more of the suit against him'until about two weeks ago , when a man who said he represented a press bureau called and elbowed a manuscript which told of the suit for $100,000 , the grounds on which It had been brought , and also of a suit for divorce witrcia , Ward had brought against his wife and in which Mr. Bridgham was accused as corespondent . Mr , Bridgham told him the story was not true , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimation he had of the divorce suit . It was stated that Ward had secured a divorce from his wife . A few days alter this episode Mrs. Bridgham received a letter from a woman who signed herself Eugenia Ward . The letter told of the divorce case and contained an intimation that Mrs. Ward might call at the Schermerhorn house . The letter was forwarded to Lawyer Bartlett , who by this time had-detectives on the ease . About the same time that the news bureau man called on Mr. Bridgham , Lawyer John J. Halligan , whose office is in the New York Life Building , had a call from Lee Hawley . He had defended Hawley a month before in Jefferson Market Court , where the latter was charged with stealing some diamonds . Hawley 's alleged wife was a prisoner with him . They were discharged . Hawley was accompanied by a stylishly dressed and pretty woman , about thirty-five years of age , whom he introduced to Mr. Halligan as Mrs. Ward , a proepective client . The woman told him her husband had obtained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as counsel to reopen the case . Mr. Halligan said he would charge her $100 as a retainer . She promised to call the next day , but did not return , and five days later he received a letter from her dated at the Windsor Hotel , Philatielpria , asking him to take steps at once to reopen the divorce case . Mr. Halligan , being same what suspicions , investigated , and learned that no such divorce as she spoke of hail been granted in this city . Mrs. Ward 's visit to Lawyer Flanigan and her desire to " reopen " the alleged divorce case is charged to have been part of the scheme to frighten Mr. Bridgham into settling the $100,000 suit by paying a portion of the amount asked . Lawyer Brown called on Mr. Bartlett a few days after the letter from Mrs. Ward was sent to Mrs. Bridgham in regard to the case , but received little encouragement , and left , it is said , with the remark that he would be compelled to force the suit . Thus matters stood when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether they had located Ward and his wife or not is not known . Mr. Bridgham , Lawyer Brown , Notary Merzback , Lawyer Halligan. and J. J. Murphy of the Union News Bureau were all summoned before the Grand Jury . Lawyer Brown and Murphy failed to appear . On the testimony of the others the three indictments were found . Mr. Bridgham declined to talk about the case yesterday , referring every one to Mr. Bartlett . Mr , Bartlett characterized the case as a most audacious attempt to blackmail an innocent man . " Many men more timid than Mr. Bridgham , " he said , " would have fallen into the trap and paid money in the hope of avoiding publicity . We have clear evidence against the conspirators , and it is only a question of time as to when they will be in custody . " J. J. Murphy said yesterday that he learned of the case through a young man from Lawyer Brown 's office , who brought him a written statement of the alleged facts , and wanted him to sell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Mr. Bridghatn , and after the latter had denied the truth of the story , he called on .1r . Brown . Suspecting that there was some deep scheme on foot , he then went to Mr. Bartlett and told him what he had learned . Mr. Murphy 's failure to appear before the Grand Jury was clue to the fact that he did not get the summons in time .
