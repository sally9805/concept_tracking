Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Land , O , land of the Fair God , Land where ancient , savage races Through barbarian ages trod ! Through thy story fancy traces Facts above what fictions say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations in a day ! Where the wigwam stood so lonely , Lordly cities rise in might ; Where spread desert wildness only , Fertile farms and homes delight . Thou hast summoned to thy bosom From the ends of all the earth , All the youngest , strongest , bravest , Full of will and wondrous worth . O'er thy valleys grow the blossoms Culled from earth 's remotest sod ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Land , O , Land of the Fair God ! Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! There is music in thy name . There is gladness in thy glory , There is fondness in thy fame ! In the wonders of thy story Shines the sheen of noble deed , Brighter than the glare of battle Where the warriors toil and bleed ; Ruling with immortal forces , There is found the king of might , Over all thy great resources By the strength of truth and right . With thy happy sons and daughters , Live the virtues fair and pure , And the better angels guiding Keep their hearts and souls secure . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! How thy name my bosom thrills ! Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Child of law and liberty , Thou art always true and tender , Thou art ever dear to me ! I will always praises render To the grandeur of thy worth , For the fortunes all presided At the moment of thy birth . Pleasures in their pure completeness O'er thy pleasant prairies shine , And the raptures run with fleetness Through the happy vales of thine . Thou art empress of the angels , Thou art queen of all the gods , And the happiness of heaven O'er thy laughing valleys nods . I will always crown with praises All thy glories , O , my state ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Thou art greatest of the great ! Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Bravest are thy noble sons , In the thunders of the battle , And the roaring of the guns ! Flash of sword and musket 's rattle Never fearful terror gave To the staunch and valiant bosoms Of thy happy hosts and brave . When the roars of hell grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lurid clouds of powder , They are foremost in the fight ; And when bayonet and musket , Sword and saber , slaughter cease , They are tenderest and truest In the silent ways of peace . O , my state ! A stream of greatness From thy mighty people runs ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Bravest are thy noble sons ! Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Fairest are thy daughters fair , In the thousand deeds of duty Thou hast given them to bear ; Peerless is their wondrous beauty , Bright with blushes as the rose , Pure as petals of the lily , White as newly-fallen snows ; And their voices bright with blessing Banish misery and woe , While their fingers ' soft caressing Soothes the fevers from the brow . Souls are always blessed with brightness Bosoms filled with goodly pearls , Hearts forever harvest gladness , In the glances of thy girls . They are robed in golden garments , Nature 's vestments , rich and rare ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Fairest are thy daughters fair ! Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Sweetest are thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee always roams ; They are never linked with sadness , They are never bound with pains , For the sunshine of enjoyment Rules the people of thy plains . Songs are singing with thy maidens , Music echoes with thy wives , Rapture slays the grief that ladens All the gladness of their lives . Happiness is with thy husbands , And thy swains are blest with joy , While the fondest rapture rises In the hearts of girl and boy . Pleasures linger in thy woodlands , Gladness on thy prairies roams ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Sweetest are thy happy homes ! Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Thou shall ever live in song ; Freedom , near to nature , raises Temples that to thee belong ; Minstrels shall in merry praises Wind their music o'er thy name Till the voices of the ages Shout for thee in wild acclaim ; They shall sing with tender pleasure Beauty of thy daughters true ; Sing , in high , exultant measure , Deeds thy sons in battle do . Sages shall in wisdom offer Full rewards of love to thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty . All thy glory shall be shining Through the cycles clear and strong ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Though shall ever live in song ! Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Romance of the ages , thou ! Now , unknown ; a moment later . Kingly crowns upon thy brow ! Child of all the nations , greater Shall thy splendors year by year Grow unfading , bringing bounties Full of happiness and cheer ! Morning saw a desert sleeping , Worn and wasted with distress ; Night beheld an empire keeping Watch above the wilderness . Progress with her wand of magic Touched the sleeping valleys bright , And they leaped with instant vigor , Shaking out their locks of might ; Earth shall send her fairest blossoms As a garland for thy brow ; Oklahoma ! Oklahoma ! Romance of the ages thou ! THE RACE FOR HOMES . APRIL 22 , 1889 . Behold ! As from the shades of night , An army gathers full of might , And strong with constant courage stands ' Tween civilized and savage lands , Where , vast in power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That men of might may enter in And progress all her glories win ! Lo , where these thousands make assail , The barren ages all shall fail , And swift advancement far be hurled , O'er sleeping empires and the world ! The morning hours haste hurried by ; Behold ! The noon is drawing nigh ! The anxious host with careful eyes Marks well each rapid hour that flies , While hope , exulting , wildly rolls The highest , such as filled the souls Of Jason and his comrades bold , Who sought the famous fleece of gold . Upon the trampled grasses beat Impatient steeds with restless feet ; The dins of harsh , discordant cries Above the thrilling thousands rise ; Shrilly the scattered children call , And soft the words of women fall , While men with voices hushed and weak Their low commands expectant speak ; Till suddenly a mighty cry , A shout of warning , smites the sky : " Attention ! Ho , Attention here ! Attention ! Lo , The noon is near ! " O'er hill and brake Resounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hosts awake ; Awake , to strive with mad delight , Awake to win the friendly fight ; And from the camps anear and far , Where nervous haste and hurry are , Vast legions gather on the plain , While chaos and confusion reign ; The neighing steed with quickened pace Impatient seeks the vantage place ; The slower ox with lightened load Stands waiting in the crowded road . And wagon , buggy , carriage , cart , Vehicles formed with rudest art , All forward , forward , forward dart , Swift-forming on the level ground Where most advantage may be found . " Line up ! Ho , there , Line up , line up ! " The hurried order smites the air ; Above the silent prairies fair Unseen progression holds her cup , Filled to the brim with magic seeds That harvests hold for human needs . Excitement grows on beasts and men ; The saddle girths are tightened o'er , The stirrups lengthened out once more , And silence softly falls again ; Each bit and buckle , strap and band , Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chosen place Stand ready for the coming race ; The circling sun His morning race has fully run ; A waving hand Signals above the brief command That sight and sense will understand ,  --  And open swings the desert land ! A shot ! A hundred , thousand more The grassy meadows echo o'er ; A shout ! From countless throats a shout , On rolling wings leaps madly out ; A yell , a raging roar , that flies On bounding winds o'er hill and glen , And ' round the land electrifies A thousand living miles of men ! A mammoth stir , A sudden dash , Swift whip and spur Together clash , And wheels on wheels that totter crash ! They 're off ! They 're off ! Away , away , In mad array ! No stop nor stay ! The hurried charge they ride to-day Would shame and scoff The Tartar , Turk and Romanoff ! The race is on ; The host is gone ; The thronging legions madly ride O'er hill and dale , With hurried pace unsatisfied . In fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blent Tell where the mounted armies went , Like shifting shadows , faint and dim , Or ghostly spectors , gaunt and grim , Beyond the far horizon 's rim ! Behold ! Adown the valleys bright , The last , lone straggler fades from sight , And only hasty hoof-beats say What thousands rode the race to-day ; What hosts , with hearts that build and bless , Found homes amid the wilderness ! AT PERRY , SEPTEMBER 16 , 1893 . Crowds ! Crowds ! Crowds ! Suddenly here as if come from the clouds That faded away as they came ; Mad acres of people aflame With thirst for a morsel of land ; Wild hunters of fortune , whose game Is ever escaping the hand ; Vast , countless , uncountable throngs With restless , unrestable feet , That hurry the ways , full of agonized wrongs , For the conquest of happiness sweet ; Wild seas of ambition whose waves of desire On their obstacles mighty continually beat , Where neither the shore nor the ocean is fixed ; Like thunderous songs of a choir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are terribly mingled and mixed . Dust ! Dust ! Dust ! Borne in the arms of the gathering gust , And whirled on the wings of the wind , The eyes feel the blight of the blind , And horror comes into the heart ; For nature is far more unkind Than the thousands that struggle apart . Dark , wild , inescapable dust , In fiercest , untamable clouds , That men into misery helplessly thrust , And bury in agony-shrouds ; A simoom of sorrow whose pestilent breath To the strong and the weak , to the young and the old , Brings despair that is reckless of possible gain , And the awfullest anguish of death ; Till the soul in its rage uncontrolled , Droops low in the horrible sickness and sorrow of pain . But out from the clouds , Out from the agonized dust that enshrouds ; True kings shall arise who shall reign In homes on the populous plain ! Great cities shall gather and grow In glories that never shall wane , Far over the valleys below . With merry yet measureless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the desert the newest delight . The barren shall bloom as the rose , and the land That is sleeping , a wilderness wasted and wild , And dreaming to welcome its master 's command , Shall leap at the touch of his hand , His voice shall obey as a child ! " SING ME A SONG , O , WIND . " Sing me a song , O , Wind , Of musical cadence sweet , Which in the wood around Shall often and oft repeat ; Soft as an angel 's song That never can give annoy , Which in the balmy notes Shall tell me its tales of joy . Sing me a song , O , Wind , Of countries beyond the sea , Which in thy wand'rings oft Thou pass with a footstep free ; Lands that are ever green ' Neath blaze of the tropic spells , Bright with their blessed suns , Where summer forever dwells . Sing me a song , O , Wind , Of groves with a verdure fair , Waving their boughs of green O'er solitudes grand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cooling shades , Where from its cares the race May rest in the leafy glades . Sing me a song , O , Wind , Of birds with a plumage gay , That with their carols sweet Give praise to the God of day ; Music of sad refrain , Though fond in its tender chime , Thou in thy travels wide Hast heard in a fairy clime . Sing me a song , O , Wind , Of crystalline brooks at play , Which with the murmurs low Make sweetest of sounds all day ; Winding through meadows wide , And blossoming fields between , Fringed with the willows tall On emerald banks of green . Sing me a song , O , Wind , Of flowers that are fond and fair , Filling the fields of earth With beauty and fragrance rare ; Wafting an incense pure On every breeze that blows , Drawn from the lily 's heart And soul of the royal rose . Sing me a song , O , Wind , Of man in his brightest homes ; Tell if he there meet joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e'er a place Where , all his ambition spent , He toils throughout all his days And knoweth no discontent . Sing me a song , O , Wind , For I am a-weary now ; Life , with its woes and cares , Hangs heavily on my brow ; Sing me a song of cheer , My heart that is sad to ease ; Sing in thy brightness and joy With heavenly harmonies ! A CHRISTMAS CAROL . The brazen bells of laughing lands In swelling echoes wildly ring , And over seas and hoary strands This Christmas carol sing . " Awaken , O , heart of the race , To bountiful riches from Eden above , Till roses of beauty and lilies of grace Shall sweeten the languishing bosom with love ; Till virulent sorrow and venomous hate Their poisonous curses of misery cease , And rapturous fortune , felicitous fate , Have rule in the musical meadows of peace . " The voices of morning to men , In passionate whispers of bounteous glee , Are pulsing the gladness of Christmas again O'er plains of the prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O , languishing soul , In limitless treasures of marvelous cheer , Till ravishing murmurs of lullabies roll Through all of the sorrows that sadden the year ! " Though summer has gone from the earth , And silken embraces of velvety snow Are folding the blossoms of beauty and worth In wretched surroundings of wearisome woe ; Let innocent joys in their sweetness abound And silvery cadence in melody start , Till rapturous fortunes with pleasure surround The aims of the soul and the hopes of the heart . " Let youth with its yearning engage All vigorous passion that lives in the breast , While tearful remembrance of tottering age Finds halcyon harbors of comforting rest ; Let silver of years with the ardor of youth Be going again through the temple of joy , While palms of amusement and laurels of truth Encircle the hearts of the maiden and boy . " Let happiness reign with the race ; There 's never a reason for sorrowful tears , Kriss Kringle has come with his fatherly face To comfort complaining humanity 's fears ; Let music go ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom of bliss , Till gentle enjoyments unbroken beguile The souls of the sad with their coveted kiss . " Though crystalline frost on the trees , Though ice on the river and snow on the plain Are freezing the breath of the shivering breeze . The heart has Nepenthe for all of its pain ; For Christmas is king , and his bountiful hand Is giving its treasures to mountain and lea , And gentleness rules on the billowy strand , And reigns in the far-away isles of the sea . " This is the carol that swells Over the meadows and brakes , From brazen throats of the pealing bells When Christmas morning wakes . YEARS THAT ARE TO BE . Wild years that are to be The sad completion of my weary life , In ghostly mantles of despairing strife Your phanton dimness darkly shadows me ! Gaunt demons dancing from your horrid halls Entwine my soul in gloomy arms of woe , While mystic fancies to my madness show The monsters on your walls . Your forms are skeletons , Whose bony hands with mortal fingers play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And airy specters meet the timid ones ; Death drops his arrows from your sullen skies , Destruction dances in your noisome shades , And in the dreadful darkness of your glades The horrid shriekings rise . There in your cycles are Dark valleys where my weary feet must go , Though devils of disaster hurl and throw Their awful sorrows from the fortunes far ; No hands of pleasure can presume to part The clouded curtains of impending care , And hissing serpents of insane despair Pour poison in my heart . O , years that are to be , Among your solitudes I , dreaming , grope ; My life 's the shade of unaccomplished hope , My heart 's a ghoul that feeds on agony ! No strains of music call my tears away , No smiling star illumes the awful night ; Ambition weeps ; my soul draws without light My shameless feet astray ! No soothing welcome floats Between your marble lips , nor sweetly rise The tender songs of gentle melodies From croaking caverns of your iron throats ; But from your dirges of destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Where death and failure , tears and misery , In robes or anguish reign . But my heart hopes to find Some infant joy for woes that sorrow did , Some faded garland on some coffin lid , To cheer the wildness of my broken mind ; Some angel pleasures in your realms must roll , Some laughing life , some music , in your glooms , Shall gladness give , amid your ghostly tombs , Mad Future , to my soul ! IF WE DO N'T OR IF WE DO . If we do n't or if we do . What 's the odds to me and you ? Fame is e'er a heartless jade , And her slaves are poorly paid ; Weary hearts and soul 's distress Are the prices of success ; All our stations sadness view ,  --  If we do n't or if we do . If we do n't or if we do , Our deservings will accrue ; We must pay the fullest price , For each virtue and each vice , And each life for every thing Must an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't or if we do . If we do n't or if we do , Fortune to our worth is true ; Trophies that enshroud our clay , Scarce are worth the price we pay ; Shame doth small endeavors share , Fame and glory , toil and care ; Earth floats but an equal crew , If we do n't or if we do . If we do n't or if we do , What 's the diff'rence ' tween the two , When our souls have gone to God And we sleep beneath the sod ? Kindred grasses wave and creep Where the prince and pauper sleep ; We shall have our six-feet-two , If we do n't or if we do . If we do n't or if we do , We but dust and ashes brew ; Labor , trouble , toil and strife Weave within each human life ; Sorrows cloud the younger years ; Age is bowed with cares and tears ; Accidents in fame are few ,  --  If we do n't or if we do . If we do n't or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; If we fail , or falter not , Every life deserves his lot ; Every human , small or great , Buys with current coin his fate ; What 's the odds to me and you , If we do n't or if we do ? DEAR SONGS OF MY COUNTRY ! Dear songs of my country ! How sweetly thy measures Come stealthily stealing o'er mountain and wave , To sweeten the riches of liberty 's treasures And thrill with their numbers the hearts of the brave ! To move in wild glory the souls of a nation , Till men are together so happily hurled , That millions are bound in fraternal relation And brotherhoods rule in the ranks of the world . Such praises ye offer our heroes and sages , So grand is the greatness that lives in thy strains , That small is the fame of the far away ages , So sunken in tyranny , fettered in chains . For freedom ye strive and ye struggle for glory , And Liberty -- Liberty still is your theme --  And glad are your lips with the national story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear songs of my country ! The soul patriotic Ye fill with the wishes of mighty emprise , Till conquers he tyranny harsh and despotic , Or first in the front of the battle he dies . Ye offer him laurels , ye crown him with praises , Who falls in the fight with his face to the foe , And gratitude over his sepulcher raises The marbles eternal of national woe . Your strains are as high as the cloud-covered mountains , As deep as the ocean , as wide as the land , As pure as the murmurs of silvery fountains , But loud as the roar on the billowy strand . Our deep-furrowed prairies , our ship-laden rivers , Our ax-ringing forests , our steam-shrieking bays , Swell high in your music , for all are free givers To freedom 's true grandeur and liberty 's praise . How fondly , dear songs of my country , ye cherish The struggle heroic , the God-shapen deed , That nothing of worthiness ever may perish But live to the time of humanity 's need ! Afar from the realms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories of years , To greet every hero with cadences golden , And sing every sage that in greatness appears . The ages may falter thee , Land of my Birth , The years may thy grandeur and glory betray ; But long as thy songs murmur over the earth , No forces can carry thy splendors away ! Then live , ye dear songs of my country , forever , With voices eternal to utter her name , That cycles may never her liberty sever , Nor trample her greatness nor crumble her fame ! JULY FOURTH . Hail , glorious morning of Columbia 's birth , Celestial dawn of freedom ! There shall be In recognition of thy wondrous worth By mighty millions this side of the sea , Triumphant crowns of laurel wreathed for thee ! Welcome thy mammoth pageants , welcome all The choral songs and melodies of glee , The swelling shouts of praise that gladly fall From mighty multitudes in anthems national ! High hangs the sacred banner , and the stars Dance in the sunshine , while the breezes play Around the glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay Floats from the patriot host and cheers array Great shouts around its foldings . Long in state , Flag of the brave and free , wave o'er this day To bring the world rejoicings which await The natal hours of might , the day we celebrate ! How fears the tyrant in his capital , As myriad wires throb with the nation 's tale ! How despot trembles in his castled hall , When liberty 's wild shouts of power prevail , And give their gladness unto every gale ! Fetters and chains dissolve in holy trust , Scepters and swords in puny weakness fail , While crowns and thrones make monumental dust , And kingly Might is dead , Oppression downward thrust . Wide float thy wondrous paeans ; loudly range Thy songs of holy rapture ; and the roars Of deep-mouthed cannons echo wild and strange Through shouting cities ; Patriotism pours Her full libations on the trembling shores , Till earth reels with her triumph ; and the voice Of millions mad with merriment far soars From sea to ocean with entrancing noise , Till nations hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag of freedom , and this day Still live in hearts of nations ! O , thou Land , Where Man was first the monarch , where the sway Of birth exalted first was broken , stand To guard the helpless with a mighty hand , And give the weak protection ; scout the ban Which tyrants utter , and with growing band Of noble freemen serve thy primal plan , And bind all nations in the Brotherhood of Man ! " O , GENTLE SHADE OF QUIET WOODS . " O , gentle shade of quiet woods , Where nature dwells in leafy halls , I love the sacred voice that falls In music o'er thy solitudes ! Within thine arms the weary heart Is hidden from the toils of men , And pleasure makes ambition start Into a nobler life again . Among the fragrant shadows throng With all the riches of their truth , Glad echoes from the days of youth And mingle into laughing song ; While angel fingers touch the keys That slumber in the silent breast , Till mem'ry wakes her lullabies And childhood fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the aged years intrude , And dance amid the summer wood The golden dreamings of the boy ; Again the songs of wonder thrill The days of life with gladness wild , And lofty visions fondly fill The longing fancies of the child . Enchanted choirs of baby years , Sweet dirges from the cradle 's keys , The glories of your harmonies Impel my secret soul to tears ! The roses of my fancies fade Into the dust of wicked strife , And all the promise boyhood made Has proved the desert of my life . O , fragrant woods of happy times , Fair children of the glowing days , How sweet the music of your lays Is mingled into fairy chimes ! Ye lisp again the songs of yore , The stories of my infant years , And throw a sweeter cadence o'er My hoary sorrows and my tears ! LOVE . Angelic theme of ancient lays ! By Doric hills , Athenian vales , The nations bound thy brows with bays And fanned thy cheeks with scented gales ; While golden lamps illumed thy shrines Beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught to flow Along the Alps and Appenines . The souls of sages and of slaves Were faithful servants unto thee , Whose rapture soothed the Grecian waves , And kissed the islands of the sea ; And bounding on from strand to strand It crossed the coasts and climbed the slopes , To place a crown of tender hopes Upon the vine-clad Roman land . Great empress of that early time , Glad ruler of the gentle souls , Each year is changed to raptured rhyme That o'er thy laughing bosom rolls ; For cycles as they sink to rest So closely guard thy joy and truth , That fondness and immortal youth Give sweet embraces to thy breast . Thou goddess of the Paphian shrine , Cytheran queen of Ion 's isle , Fair Venus from the land of wine , The races love thy dewy smile ; While silent hills and dewy glades Bear praises on each breeze that blows , Sweet as the breath of morning rose That blossoms in the woodland shades ! Then crown , O , Love , these later days With mystic charms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bays , And nations hungered for thy kiss ! No more thy temples tower above , But lives and bosoms hold thee dear ; Then come with all thy worth of cheer And gentleness , O , mighty Love ! WINTERS ON THE FARM . Glad winters on the olden farm ! How raptures from those early times Commingle into fairy chimes Which gently banish cries of harm ! My fainting soul finds rest the whiles Within the arms of memory , And tender scenes of boyish glee Transform my sorrows into smiles . How brightly beamed the pleasures then , When frigid fingers came to throw A wintry winding sheet of snow Around the silent homes of men ! But happiness found no alarm , For safe with cheer , secure with love , She gladly grew and sweetly throve Through winters on the olden farm . With merry bells and busy sleighs , That sung and flew o'er icy vales And climbed the hills as fleet as gales , Like singing phantoms died the days ; Or then with coat and muffler warm Sweet children glided on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In winters on the olden farm . How glad the joys at eventide When ' round the hearth-stone 's pleasant heat The simple song in music sweet From loving voices floated wide ! The mellowed apples gave a charm , While pop-corn white and cider bright With worlds of laughter lent delight To winters on the olden farm . Thrice happy nights and happy days , Sweet isles of pleasure in the past , May long your hallowed moments cast A sacred sunshine o'er my ways ! And where life leads me , gladly arm My soul with angel songs of bliss , With true embrace and holy kiss , O , winters on the olden farm ! " O , WEAK AND WEARY WORLD ! " O weak and weary world Forever struggling on , When will thy toils in comfort be impearled , When will thy sorrows and thy cares be gone ? When shall the races , all ambition dead , Forsake the stony slope and rocky steep , And in contentment sweetly wed The joys that never sleep ? O , weak and weary world , Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woe are darkly curled With endless troubles and enduring pain ; When will thy bosom , faint and helpless grown , Rest sweetly in the balmy bowers of ease ? Avoid the woes that constant groan And follow shapes that please ? O , weak and weary world , Why search the hills and seas ? All Nature is in secrecy enfurled And thou canst never solve her mysteries ; Thou canst not understand nor comprehend Her varied movements nor the intricate , The systems that so far extend , Creation wide and great . O , weak and weary world , Why more attempt advance ? Long have thy forces in confusion whirled In circles through the misty maze of chance ; The nations rise and sink in sepulchres , Thy peoples perish in a common grave ; Progression dies , perfection errs , Wrong rules the wood and wave . O , weak and weary world , Let thy ambition rest ! Long have defeat and gloomy ruin twirled In dark embrace the purest and the best ; Destruction is thy portion , death thy part , Ashes thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longings of thy breast ; Serve pleasures well ; and trust ! EX ANIMA . The gloomy hours of silence wake Remembrance and her train , And phantoms through the fancies chase The mem'ries that remain ; And hidden in the dark embrace Of days that now are gone , I see a form , a fairy form , And fancy hurries on ! I see the old familiar smile , I hear the tender tone , I greet the softness of the glance That cheered me when alone ; The ruby chains of rich romance That bound our bosoms o'er , I still can know , I still can feel , As they were felt before . I name the vows , the fresh young vows , That we together said ; What matters it ? She can not know ; She slumbers with the dead ! Again the fields of fate I sow , As she and I have sown ; I dream again the same old dreams , But I am left alone ! The twining grasses verdant wreathe Above her silent grave ; The rose and violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountains fall The tender tides of tears ; A sorrow winds among the days , And chains the passing years . My life commingles shine with shade , The lily with the rose , And in my heart a loathsome weed Beside each lily grows ; Through every thought , through every deed , The somber shadows play ; And I am sad , alone and sad , And life is never gay . " LO , ALL THE AGE IS RANK WITH WRONG . " Lo , all the age is rank with wrong ! The nations kneel to monstrous might , And horrid cries that haunt the night , Have hushed the notes of happy song ; Mankind the deepest truth has missed , The best emotions have grown dim ; We praise the God that dwelt in Christ , But crucify the man in him . Laws , noble , good , and great at first , With plan perverted , bind again The regal rights of mind and men And prove of tyrants far the worst ; With blinded eyes is Nature made , And knows her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Esau finds his blessing lost . Earth yields her fruits in ample store ; Her children all are heirs that trace Their lineage through the royal race , And all her wealth is theirs -- and more ; But one with cunning hand controls The portions that his brothers fed , While thousands -- just and worthy souls --  In aimless anguish cry for bread ! No royal blood by caste or creed , No pride of place , no gild of gold Can warm the weak , accursed with cold , Or light the awful nights of need ; Labor alone can blessings bring To crown the brows of freedom 's brave ; The toiler is the truest king , The idler is the only slave ! But laugh , O , Labor , dry thy tears ! A better day is drawing nigh ; Hope brightens all the somber sky ; The golden age of Love is near ! Behold ! But yonder stands a Star ! The ancient lies are downward hurled ; A man -- a child -- is greater far Than all the wealth of all the world ! " LOVE , THOU GAYEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soul-deceiver , Come with all thy clinging kisses ; Bringing all thy beaming blisses ; It may serve the cynic 's parts , If he curse and if he scout thee , But , O , where were gentle hearts , If they had to live without thee ! Weave the spells of thy beguiling ' Round and ' round me with thy smiling , Till the ashen cheek is beaming , And the faded eye is gleaming ; Millions may endure the fight In the battle vain to end thee , But when taste they thy delight They will serve thee and defend thee .

But hope , O , heart , for future weal ! The waters rest beyond the wheel ; So life may sing when toil is done And all its battles lost or won . There lives a sweeter music there , Of gentle and melodious measure , Where weeping never comes and where The ages perish into pleasure . SHADOW AND SHINE . They will find in this life who are grieved with its gladness No songs for the heart and no hopes for the soul , But will faint in the glooms where the dirges of sadness In tremulous murmurs of wretchedness roll ; For the sweets of this earth never lavish their kisses Where lives in the valleys of rapture repine ; In the tortures they mourn who denounce all the blisses ,  --  They weep in the shadow that rail at the shine . In the fields that are fair with the blooms of the clover , No garlands are grown for the arbors of shade Where the woes of the wood in their darkness hang over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; From the chimes of the breezes there echo no measures That gladden the gale with a music divine ; In the troubles they languish who shrink from the pleasures , They weep in the shadow that rail at the shine . Ah , the world is abounding with wonderful glories And wild are the warbles that sweeten its ways While the songs of the land sing their beautiful stories , And scatter their melodies over the days ! There are smiles , there are joys , never mingled with sorrow , O , man , in return for the tears that are thine , And the soul never sobs that has hopes for the morrow , Nor weeps in the shadow nor rails at the shine ! THE GROWTH OF SONG . A tender song in shadows grew , And humble hearts were homes it knew . But through its wondrous music stole The longings of the human soul ; The hopes of hosts unsatisfied Within its numbers wandered wide ; And strangely wet with toilsome tears It held the yearnings of the years ; Till millions with their woes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till nations in their troubled ways Found comfort in the joyous lays , And all the halting race of wrong Exalts the loving might of song ! Ah , song that soothes our many cries With fondness of thy lullabies , We love , we bless , we scepter thee Proud empress of the hearts that be ! SPRING AND MUSIC . Spring , among her sylvan shades , And the gladness of her glades , Once in dreamy hours was straying , Where sweet Music with her throngs Of glad melodies and songs In the happy vales was playing . Pan beheld the fairy maids As they gamboled in the shades , And he swore they should not sever . But that o'er the blooming land , Heart to heart and hand in hand , They should wander on forever . Thus when come the gentle days O'er the wildwood 's tangled ways , There is found no gloomy weather ; For among the leafy bowers And the valleys bright with flowers Spring and Music walk together ! COMPENSATION . The softest beams of the stars are born in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening shadows rise ; The sweetest songs of the bird are sung in the darkest days , And rarest blooms of the spring are found in the wildest ways . The brightest blush of the rose is blown as the petals fade . The greenest grass of the earth is grown in the hidden glade ; The fondest rhyme of the rill is heard in the secret vale , And lightest lays of the breeze are borne from the dying gale . The highest hopes of the heart in saddest of sorrows grow , The purest pleasures of joy arise in the wane of woe ; The gladdest smiles of the lips are seen in the hours of pain , And proudest days of the free are spent by the broken chain . The grandest deeds of the race are writ on the faded scroll , The truest rivers of good from villainous fountains roll ; The perfect raptures of life are reared in the arms of care , And Hope with her joys dispels the darkness of our despair . MY MOLLIE , O ! ' T was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O , That in the brightness of her bloom , I first did meet my Mollie , O. Although she said for lives to love Was nothing but pure folly , O , My heart was lit with light above , And I true loved my Mollie , O. O , swift and fast the days did flee And seemed most bright and jolly , O , For evermore was near to me My fair and lovely Mollie , O. Now I doth sit through all the day And nurse my melancholy , O , For from me she has turned away , O , false and fickle Mollie , O ! SING NOT OF BEAUTY . Sing not of beauty 's grace to me ; Its very name a story tells Of doubly dark inconstancy , Love falser than a hundred hells . Its face is often but a screen To hide a devil 's heart of guile , Of thoughts and deeds of shameful mien , By winning looks of heartless wile . Its laughing smile is but the gleam That springs from dross of foulest make ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trusting heart to break . Sing not of beauty 's grace to me ; I can not bear to hear the name ; For , oh ! Too oft in it I see A soul of falsehood and of shame ! AT EVENTIDE . At eventide , when glories lie In crimson curtains hung on high , And all the breast of heaven glows With mingled wreaths of flowers and snows , The dearest dreams of life draw nigh . The pleasures in their soft robes fly With angel wings adown the sky , And rapture lulls to sweet repose , At eventide . Ah , well-a-day ! Life 's weary cry , And all its curse and care shall die , When Age on downy couches throws His weary limbs and only knows The tender dreams of bye-and-bye , At eventide ! WHEN CHRISTMAS COMES . When Christmas comes , what pleasures spring From drooping hearts on happy wing , Like joyous birds that soaring rise From hidden coverts to the skies . And echo in the chimes that ring ! Glad millions in wild rapture sing Hosannaed hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas comes . Ah , happy hours ! Around them cling The dearest joys that life may bring , And all the world 's despairing cries Are soothed to sleep with lullabies That banish every bitter thing , When Christmas comes ! WHEN THOU ART NEAR . When thou art near , with gladdest grace My heart is held in fond embrace , For laughing lips with raptures bless The toils and tears of my distress , And woes within me have no place . The halting hours with hurried pace Whirl wildly on through happy space , And life is light with happiness , When thou art near . Like mortals whom an angel race Renews with gladness face to face , I thrill with Love 's unseen caress That holy hands upon me press , And Heaven 's pleasures all I trace , When thou art near . HE SLEEPS AT LAST . He sleeps at last ! The vales of rest Are waiting for the war-worn breast , And glorious angels fondly spread The sweetest roses for his bed . While countless millions call him blest . Fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow are pressed , And laurels cluster o'er his head ; He sleeps at last . O , deep the sorrows here confessed , Where Freedom makes eternal quest ! The wondrous chief that proudly led The long , blue lines that fought and bled , In peace is now no more distressed ; He sleeps at last ! WHEN FORTUNES FROWN . When fortunes frown , the woes , bedight With brooding shadows , bring the night , While dismal sorrows darkness dole , And disappointments rise and roll Above the longings for the light . Despair , with hands that curse and blight , Sows weakness in the hearts of might Until they falter near the goal , When fortunes frown . But onward still ! The valleys white With Heaven 's blossoms are in sight ; The Holy Mountains , knoll on knoll , Are waiting for the Master Soul , And he shall conquer for the right , When fortunes frown ! WHEN WE SHALL MEET . When we shall meet , I strangely know The mad emotions that shall flow Across my heart all quivering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladdened so . And I all shy and silent grow Beneath his glance of gladness , though Wild yearnings through my bosom spring , When we shall meet . Till joyful tears of passion show , And to his kind embrace I throw My heart unworthy , and I cling With deathless fondness to the king I worshipped in the Long Ago , When we shall meet ! SWEET EYES OF BLUE . Sweet eyes of blue ! The stars by night , That swoon the world with laughing light , And touch the hills with tender glow While all the vales are kissed below , Beside you would no more be bright . My worlds ye are , and while I throw My heart to catch the beams that flow From your fair shrine , my woes take flight , Sweet eyes of blue ! Glad orbs of beauty ! In your sight My soul mounts up with secret might , Till Eden 's lovely bowers I know ; And as through Heaven 's gates I go , The pleasures all my sorrow smite , Sweet eyes of blue ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brooding woe And all the griefs that greater grow , Might not have been , and happy-wise Our lives have laughed with lullabies And quaffed such joys as few may know . Our days beneath embittered skies Where anguish moans and sorrow cries , Might not have wept and wandered so , Had we not met ! But ah , my darling ! All we prize ,  --  Love and sweet trust that never dies , Wild yearnings that with constant flow From kindred heart to bosom go ,  --  Would never in our souls had rise , Had we not met ! A SONNET . We gentler grow by sorrow ; not the breast That never crouches in the nights of tears , That never bends beneath the loads of years , Has sympathies that are the kindliest . There is a strength in agony that best Can link the careless heart with human fears , And teach it that fond kindness which endears The millions that with sadness are oppressed . Grief softens while it saddens ; pleasure smites The timid soul with harshness , till it knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of its struggles ; sorrow plights Her troth with sorrow , and in tears unites Man unto man and hatred overthrows . OKLAHOMA ,  - -  A SONNET . Here , through the ages old , the desert slept In solitudes unbroken , save when passed The bison herds , and savage hunters swept In thund'ring chaos down the valleys vast ; But , lo ! Across the barren margins stepped Advancement with her legions , and one blast From her imperial trumpet filled the last Lone covert where affrighted wildness crept . Full armed , full armored , at her wondrous birth , Her shining temples wreathed with gorgeous dower , She sits among the empires of the earth ; Her proud achievements o'er the nations tower , Won by her people with their royal worth , With lofty culture , wisdom , wealth and power . ESTRANGED . Though far apart , my darling , side by side We wander still and our fond yearnings meet , As when our hearts with highest raptures beat Before our footsteps trod the paths of pride ; Our close companionship hath never died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And time from life 's best hopes can never hide A kindred soul that made its own complete ! So thou , dear one , shall come once more to me , The sweeter grown for all thy years of pain ; My longing arms shall open wide for thee , And thou shalt nestle on my breast again ; Then perfect love shall richly crown the years , And both be better for our griefs and tears . RECONCILED . We meet again beyond the barren past , Beyond the pride , the sorrows and the tears ; And yearnings leave the strife and hate of years To flood our souls with perfect peace at last ! Our hearts forget the wrong so deep and vast , The wounding words and all the cruel woe , Till joy is all our bounding bosoms know , And life is glad with happiness at last . Love , deathless and forgiving , crowns with bays The future and our hopes , as full of grace , As youth had fondly dreamed in other days , When first we knew how sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of men ; Beyond our pride we meet in love again ! THE DYING HERO . His greatness hath not left him ; till the years Have won the nation from her children dead , And robbed her of remembrance where she rears Her monuments above the blood they shed , Will his name want for homage ; with sad fears The Union winds her garlands o'er his head , And fondly wreathes her love , bedewed with tears , To bless the hero on his dying bed . His luster lives untarnished ; as he lies Where Malady has bound him in wild pain , And only Death can loose the heavy chain That galls her captive while his nature dies , He seems far greater in his country 's eyes , Than if an Appomattox spake again . SONNET . Somehow , someway , I can not see the light ; The giant hills of doubting reach the skies , Abiding shadows bring eternal night , And on my ways no suns of morning rise ; Dark mysteries across the years of might Crush down my hopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dim my sight , And ghostly echoes mock my fainting cries . Ah , I shall know beyond these narrow years , The glorious mornings of eternal day , Where perfect love and tender trust shall play , And smiles and laughter banish all the tears , And all the heavy mists of doubts and fears Shall leave my longing soul somehow , someway ! GREATNESS LIVES APART . Great natures live apart ; the mountain gray May call no comrade to his lonely side ; The giant ocean , wrapped in storm and spray , Has no companion for her endless tide ; The forest monarch , where his parents died , Can find no brother in his lofty sway , And mighty rivers chafe their margins wide Where infant rills and childish fountains play . So heroes live ; no raptured blossoms start Where rugged heights of human glory end ; No tender songs of loving beauty blend Their chorus in the great man 's peerless heart ; Fate fills their souls with magnitude , and art Supplies their lives with no congenial friend . POEMS . Poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of song and lovely grown , In them her glory unto man proclaims And fills his longing soul . They softly speak Of Nature 's beauty and the secrets old Concealed behind the shadows of the hills , And love on angel fingers borne to men , Naming them over in so sweet a voice That music leads their footsteps in the ways Where God has walked ; and with a lofty Harp , As wondrous as the gentle harps of heaven , Uplifts , ennobles , soothes and leads the race Unto its last great ultimate of power , To words of tenderness and goodly deeds . SINGER AND SONG . A singer sang in sorrow long And breathed his life into his song . Unknown , unheard , the song went wide , Until the singer , starving , died . Now in their hearts the nations write And wear the singer 's song of might . Ah , singers fail and fall from view , But songs are always , always new ! If garlands none to singers cling , Bays wreathe above the songs they sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world we may count ourselves blest , If we have but one friend who is faithful and true ; And so in your friendship contented I 'll rest , And believe I have found that one blessing in you . THE BANKS O ' TURKEY RUN . Like a thousan ' birds o ' brightness from the isles o ' summer seas , Rickollections , full o ' gladness , come with songs and lullabies , An ' I listen to the carols that with gentle voices roll , Full o ' tenderness an ' beauty , down upon my weary soul , Fer thar 's one thet keeps a-singin ' with a song thet 's never done , An ' I see the bendin ' willers on the banks o ' Turkey Run . An ' agin ' I be a youngster with a youngster 's foolin ' dreams , With his high-falutin ' notions an ' his fiddle-faddle schemes ; With the laughin ' an ' the cryin ' , with the sorrow an ' the joy , Thet is jumbled up together in the bosom o ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairy loom are spun Underneath the dancin ' shadders on the banks o ' Turkey Run . An ' agin I be a school-boy with the other merry lads , When Joe an ' Jerry , Bill an ' I , wus only little tads , When a half a dozen marvels an ' a kivered ball was worth --  With a knife o ' Barlow pattern -- all the treasures o ' the earth ; An ' the soundin ' sort o ' thunder from a poppin ' kind o ' gun Set our faces all a-giggle on the banks o ' Turkey Run . It ' ud tickle any feller but ter see the solemn look , When the master was a-watchin ' , thet we fastened on the book , But the mischief stickin ' in us , like pertaters in a sack , It wus never hard ter empty when the teacher turned his back ; O , the paper wads we tumbled thet ' ud weigh about a ton , In thet crazy-cornered school-house on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! How we used ter chase the robins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gethered bloomin ' posies in the sighin ' solitude ! How we wundered all the medders in our roamin 's o'er an ' o'er , How we teetered in the branches o ' the beech an ' sycamore ! Or we watched the rompin ' minners as they rasseled in their fun , While we nearly bust a-laughin ' , on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! How we used ter go a-fishin ' when the day wus gittin ' late , With a little line o ' cotton an ' a fish-worm fer a bait ! With a bent pin for a fish-hook an ' a hazel fer a pole , How we sought the softest places by the widest , deepest hole ! How we teehee-eed at the nibbles , caught the fishes one by one , With the biggest kind o ' prowess , on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! When the sun was burnin ' shavin 's in the heatin ' stove o ' June , An ' the clock upon the mantle wus a-knockin ' off the noon When the beams in bunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat was drippin ' , droppin ' , from the mouth o ' every pore , How we skipped across the medder , how our swimmin ' wus begun , In the cool an ' crystal waters ' tween the banks o ' Turkey Run ! O , the smilin ' days o ' childhood ! O , the loudly laughin ' years ! When contentment brings the moments neither heaviness ner tears ! When the pleasures jine the longin 's an ' the fairy fingers roll All the heaps o ' angel music in upon the blazin ' soul ! O , my Joe an ' Bill an ' Jerry ! Trustin ' comrades , you wus won Whar my bare feet brushed the grasses on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! But , alas ! Thar wus another ; she was fairer than the rest , An ' she allus had a hearin ' fer the wishes o ' my breast ; Allus wus a chunk o ' sunshine an ' a piece o ' quiet glee , Allus had a smile o ' welcome an ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shinin ' an ' o ' happiness wus none Ter bring gladness ter my bosom on the banks o ' Turkey Run . O , her home wus in a cottage whar the mornin ' - glories hung , An ' the arly birds o ' April with their sweetest music sung ; Thar wus roses ' round her winder , thar wus roses ' round her door , Thet wus stickin ' full o ' blushes , but they allus blushed the more , When her eyes wus seen a-peepin ' an ' her cheeks beamed like the sun , From thet cosy little cottage on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! Many an ' many a time we wandered in the grassy medder-land With our wishes right together an ' our longin 's hand in hand ; How we dreamed about the future when the world should give me fame , An ' when she would be thrice noble to be worthy o ' my name ! Thus we talked an ' thus we fancied ; others might my boyhood shun , But I found her kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the times have been a-changin ' sence them arly years o ' joy , When she wus but a little girl an ' I a little boy ; When Joe an ' Jerry , Bill an ' I , together wus at play , With our hearts as light as feathers , every minute of the day , An ' at twilight sunk ter slumber tell the mornin ' wus begun , In the gloomy silent forests on the banks o ' Turkey Run . Bill an ' Joe have gone a-rovin ' on a fortune-huntin ' quest Through the silver mines an ' Injuns in the mountains o ' the west ; But the janders came ter Jerry with a solemn sort o ' call Tell they painted him as yaller as a punkin in the fall ; An ' to-day I saw his tombstone as it glittered in the sun , Over in the little churchyard , on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! An ' alas , my precious sweetheart ! Like a lily virgin white , Did she slowly fade an ' wither tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven did she sweetly , calmly creep , An ' her lovely life wus over an ' her bosom went ter sleep ; An ' the tollin ' , tollin ' church-bells dropt the dirges one by one , As we laid her ' neath the wilier on the banks o ' Turkey Run . Thar a little cross o ' marble marks the sacred , silent shade , Whar the fair an ' laughin ' beauty o ' my ole sweetheart wus laid ; An ' the summer has a sadness thet is cryin ' through the years , An ' my heart is full o ' sorrow , an ' mine eyes is full o ' tears , Fer I 've allus had a failin ' , sence her friendship first I won , Fer thet little lovin ' maiden on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! But them days have past forever in the years o ' long ago , An ' a wishin ' ter be wealthy has enraptured Bill an ' Joe ; Death has taken Jerry ; only I , o ' all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arly angel joys ; But to-night I see their faces as they peep in full o ' fun , An ' agin we 're boys together , on the banks o ' Turkey Run ! ENVOY . Oh , to be able to capture and bring And bind in the bonds of control , Some of the carols that warble and sing Down in the depths of my soul.
