txt There is no more conflict between Mr. Trtultszox 's statement of the proceedings at Honolulu in January and Mr. BeoUieT 's report than was to be expected , considering the relations of the former to the revolutionary movement The conflict is not so much in regard to essential facts as the interpretation put upon thorn . It is not quite ingenuous in Mr. THURSTON ; to criticise Mr. BLOUNT for not going to him for information , inasmuch as his inquiry was conducted entirely at Honolulu and his report made up and . signed before he left there , while Mr. THURSTON was during that time in this country . He has had ample opportunity to impart information at Washington and Mr. BLOUNT had no opportunity in his official c apacity of obtaining it from him . Nor is it true , as plainly appears from the Special Commissioner 's report and the voluminous correspondence , with many inclosures , which preceded it , that his evidence " consists exclusively of prepared . affidavits or of answers to leading questions put by himself at private interviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , nothing could be further from the truth , as anybody can see who has access to the official documents . So far as there is conflict between the statements of Mr. Tituns.rox and Mr. BLOUNT as to essential facts , it relates chiefly to the question of secrecy or publicity in the movement of Jan. 14-17. and the object of landing the troops ou the lt ; th . According to Mr. BLouNT 's information the specific purpose of the Committee of Safety was kept from public knowledge and from the Queen until it had been accomplished , with Mr. STEVENS 'S aid and support . so that it might not be interfered with . Mr. Ttit7IISTON claims that the committee 's purpose was " avowed , " and that it proceeded openly and boldly , but his only proof is an account of consultations with the Queen 's rather shifty Ministers , while Mr. ** representation accords with the facts , as they plainly appear from the evidence furnished . As to the purpose for which the troops were landed , that is largely a matter of inference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not charge a " prearranged agreement " between Mr. STEV ENS and the Committee of Safety that they should " land and assist in the overthrow of the Queen . " Nobody has supposed that the Minister and the committee were fools . Of course , the request would in form be for legitimate " protection , " and the orders would . be in terms that could be defended , but it is plain that Mr. STeveNs knew exactly what was going on and what his position and the landing of the troops would . effect . The terms of the Queen 's protest show what they did effect . Mr. THURSTON 'S account of what happened in 1887 and 1889 is quite irrelevant and does not support the proposition which he cites it to prove . The courage and skill of himself and his associates as conspirators are not really in question , neither is what they might have accomplished " eventually " without the help of the American Minister and the United Stated marines . They did not have that help in 1887 and 1889 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force a Constitution upon the King in the one case or to compel him to retain a Cabinet in the other . Then they had a force of their own to back them and succeeded in their purpose , which was a matter of domestic politics in Hawaii . Last January they had . no force of their own , and the organized power of the existing Government was against them . Their purpose was not only the absolute overthrow of the existing form of government . but the annexation of its whole domain to the United States . They relied entirely on the support of the American Minister and the United States naval forces for success . They got that support , and would not have succeeded without it . and they involved our Government in a most embarrassing responsibility , which it is now compelled to discharge by undoing what was done by an abuse of its authority . But the real interest of Mr. THITRS TON ' S statement lies in its illustration of the point of view from which he regards the Government of the Hawaiian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and training . He is a native of the islands and a son of a missionary . He belongs to the class that has got possession of most of the best lands and built up the business interests of the country . It is the same class that shaped the monarchy and I was wont in times past to control the Government . It made the Constitution of 1887 in its own interests and forced it upon the King with a Cabinet of its own selection . It has been accustomed to have its way in Honolulu , and assumes the right to rule Hawaii and do what it will with the country . It is a small minority of wealth and intelligence " wholly of foreign origin and largely of foreign birth , but Mr. THURSTON speaks of it repeatedly as ? ? the citizens " and " the people , " seemingly unconscious that the majority . th mass of the people , the real natives , can by anybody be supposed to haverights , except that of being ruled by their superiors , who are still popularly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are evidently beyond the range of Mr. THURSTON 'S comprehension and sympathies . But we of this land have to consider them .
