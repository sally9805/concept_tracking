txt Beguiled by the antics of a school of rollicking grampus a big whale wandered into the confines of Monterey Bay or , Thursday It was a general game of tag , but business tag those fish were playing at . The water was a scene of the most incessant activity . The salmon were pursuing the sardines , and . the grampus the salmon , when the big whale dropped in to see how the kelp crop was getting along , Gen. Wade Hampton and Gen. Forsyth , both heroes of many battles , were standing on the bathhouse wharf as the leviathan approached , and thus unexpectedly became the umpires of an exciting marine contest . The grampus were not disturbed by the appearance of their colossal cousin . They rolled and tumbled , and were , to all appearances , out for a real good time . The whale kept away from them , toward the northern side of the bay . They were not in his set , and he despised their frivolity . But tlaere was an enemy on his trail , keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubtless had he known of the presence of this implacable and formidable sleuth , he would not have been diverted from his journey to the waters of Alaska . The ex-Confederate General and the commander of the military division of the Pacific were deep in a discussion of the attack on Port Hudson , when a tremendous whack , a sound like the falling of a gigantic shingle upon the cuticle of a bad boy , attracted their attention . They looked seaward and saw the beginning- of a fierce and most interesting battle . The whale 's musings in the kelp had been rudely disturbed by the terrific onslaught of a thrasher , that vindictive and muscular hoodlum who has sworn vengeance against the entire leviathan family . The thrasher , a shark-shaped fellow from 16 to 20 feet in length , launched himself on the broad back of his foe and hit him an awful slash with his tail . The whale rolled over and attempted to sound . But the thrasher never goes alone on these excursions . When he takes the warpath he engages the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the job . Therefore , when the smarting and frightened whale dives for the bottom he encounters the lance of the thrasher 's chum , which sends him quickly to the surface again to take more punishment . Now , this ally , so far as can he observed , does not prod the whale on his own account . It is only when the monster plunges clown for sanctuary that he gives him the business end of his snout . Again the thrasher let go his powerful tail , catching the whale this time on the flank , and apparently knocking him silly , for he waltzed around in a circle before attempting to sound , doubtless with a painful appreciation of the swordfish . He endeavored to do some slashing on his own account , but the thrasher was too quick for him , and , in the graphic literature . of the prize ring , dodged and countered heavily . " Pive to one on the whale ! " cried Gen. Hampton , excitedly , on the execution of this last assault . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoined Gen. Forsyth , " for unless the whale executes a flank movement , and that promptly , he is lost . " " That thrasher is bringing up his re serves . " said Gen. Hampton , as the whale was foiled by the swordfish in his third attempt to sound . The next attempt of the thrasher was an overwhelming success . He hammered and hammered away at the enemy ; he hit him under the fluke and in the back of the flock and at the base of the spinal column until the whale did not know whether he was of Cape Horn or at the north pole . Evidently the swordfish , who was not seen at any progress of the duel . but who was undoubtedly felt , kept the big fellow properly poised on the surface for the delectation rat his . employer . The two old soldiers were delighted , and Gen. Hampton 's wooden leg thumped his applause on the wharf . No bets were booked , because to even the eye unfamiliar with martial spectacles the thrasher 's sopa riority was manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and must have been extremely gratified to see their haughty social relative crucified in so scientific a fashion . Finally the whale turned tail and boomed away for Point Cypress , with the thrasher hot in his wake . Science had once more prevailed over brute strength .
