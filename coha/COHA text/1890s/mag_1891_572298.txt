UNIVERSITY TOPICS . SERMON PREACHED IN BATTELL CHAPEL , SEPTEMBER 25 , 1891 , THE FIRST SUNDAY OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR , BY PROF . GEORGE T. LADD . Acts xxii. 9 f . " And they that were with me beheld indeed the light , but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me . And I said , What shall I do , Lord ? " THERE are two pairs of words , the use of which is often confused but whose profounder meaning shows a wide separation between them . These are , on the one hand , the words " action " *nd " nature ; " and , on the other hand , the words " conduct and " character . " All things , as well as every species of animal *iiot excepting the human species , act and have natures peculiar to themselves . But only man is capable of conduct ; only man can form to himself a character ,  --  in the deeper and truer significance of these terms . This man who had been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Paul the Apostle , stood in the midst of one of those great crises which rarely occur , but which , when they do occur decide the destiny of individuals , of nations , and indeed of the whole race . His action , as springing forth from his nature in response to the stimulus of his surroundings was at that particular time most important . his question naturally is : " What shall I do ? " But the way in which , and the person of whom , he asks this question clearly show that no momentary impulse to act , however shrewd and safe the impulse might be , will satisfy the inquirer . He seeks a law of moral conduct ,  - -  of action under the direction of illumined moral reason , and expressive and formative of character . He seeks the word , that shall give to him this law , from an invisible and supernal source . His inquiry is : Lord , what wilt thou have me to be and do ? We-as members of this University-stand in one of those minor crises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question , What am I to do ? is , for each of us , not simply a reasonable and a safe inquiry . It is indeed a necessary , an obligatory inquiry . So far as most of our action is concerned , the // question will very largly be determined for us by others . The lines of doing are already pretty strictly laid down for each man of us-for teacher as well as pupil , for teacher no less but rather more than for pupil . But what our conduct , with its contributions to the growth of character , in ourselves and in others , is to be , is a question about the answer to which we have still much to determine . And for the answer to such a question as this , the thoughtful in all ages have been accustomed to look inward and upward . Let us briefly consider it as we stand upon the threshold of this new University year . The most obvious and important remark concerning this qirestion is , as it seems to me , the following The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My remark is true as regarded from several points of view . It will commend itself to the student of man , even if we take only the scientific , the biological rather than the strictly religious point of observation . There has long been and still exists much debate as to what are those characteristics which distinguish the human being from the rest of creation . The further our studies progress , the more varied and profound do these characteristics , in my judgment , appear to be . No one term , such as " reason , " " conscience , ** " free-will* " " aesthetic " sensibility , will sum up all of them . Many of the old distinctions have broken down or faded away . At one time the ceaseless self-activity of the human soul , in contrast with what was called the passivity of material nature , and even of the lower animals , made a great impression upon observers of man . But matter is no longer regarded as dead and inert , in the meaning formerly attached to those terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs for each one from a hidden inner impulse , and yet makes each one obediently regard the related position and action of all its fellows as giving to it a rule for its own action . So every molecule , and every atom , as well as every huge bulk of a world . What more wonderful than that self-acting motion , under the most complicated conditions , of which modern chemistry shows each substance to be capable ? On the other hand , man 's body and , in constantly enlarging measure , his mental life as well , are seen to have the structure and action of a most complicated mechanism . Where then shall we draw the line around the imperial domain of manhood ? In what fundamental respect does the human animal differ from those other animals which we have been ac // customed-somewliat too contemptuously  --  to speak of as mere brutes ? I have said already that , in my judgment , the work of science does not consist so much in drawing any one line about that species of feeling , thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather consists in investigating with painstaking research the myriads of lines that form a complicated net-work and so preserve our title to a distinctive human nature . Yet there is one line which the person ignorant of science may draw for himself , but which the advances of biology are not likely to obscure or to remove . This is the line indicated by the question of our text . The most ardent advocate of the superiority of the socalled " lower animals " would scarcely maintain that the inquiry of Paul falls within the capacity of any other than a human being . Surely such a question is well within the domain of man 's supremacy . It is the supreme sign and test of manhood , in the wider significance of the latter term . The animals all fight with one another ; man 's action toward his fellows differs little , in many aspects of this particular demonstration of capacity and disposition , from the action of tigers and wolves , of ants and wasps . But only man can regard this terrible form of action as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to , and given account of , before an invisible divine power . Neither wild stags nor trained bull-dogs have ever been known , before joining battle , to inquire of some divinity what wilt thou have me to do . But away back in antiquity we see the human priest bending over the entrails of the victim to ask of his god of war : " What shall I do ? " And later we read of the prayers for guidance of conduct which the man Cromwell , or some other man , like our own Lincoln or the Emperor William of Germany , has put up to the lord of battles . Choice and beautiful products result from the artistic action of animals , of birds and beetles , and even of snails and coral insects . But only his manhood could enable Palissy to regard the perfection of pottery as a study , a course of conduct under the control of a moral purpose and to be submitted to divine indications and a divine plan . Only as a man could Stradivarius feel that he was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection of the violin . The examples which I have thus far chosen have been intentionally confined to a relatively low plane of action . For they have been designed simply to illustrate the truth that even to // raise this question of Paul it is necessary to be more than a mere animal , to be indeed that unique and peerless animal which we call " man. ** But , whoever asks , " Lord , what shall I do ? " furnishes a sign and test of his manhood in a far higher meaning of the words than the foregoing explanation maintains . The question , when intelligently and sincerely asked ( and how can it readily be asked otherwise than intelligently and sincerely ) shows that the best of one 's manhood is coming to the front . For the question concerns not mere action ; it rather concerns moral conduct and moral character . It proposes , in fact , to submit all action to the dictates of an illumined conscience . It asks to hear that voice , which breaks through the mechanism of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of Being , upon the ear of man alone . It is therefore the question of maturity and manliness as distinguished from childish or youthful immaturity . It is the question of all the truly great and good in humanity as distinguished from the mean , the small , the selfish , and the bad . It is the question which assures us that he who is capable of even raising it is also capable of becoming a redeemed spiritual existence , a true son of God . Life , even human life , and that the choicest of it , does not begin with moral inquiries . The peremptory demand of the young human animal is for air and food ; and for whatever of pleasant impression and action will bring the satisfaction of desire . It scarcely belongs more to the nature of childhood and earliest youth to inquire of God after duty than to the nature of the new-born dog . Thus , in these early years , even the best and and most lovable-as Wordsworth indicates in his " Ode " - ask not " of duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls entitled to be called good , may rely without misgiving " upon the genial sense of youth . " But when the spirit of manhood begins to grow , increasing maturity makes the man of right mind say with this poet " Me this unchartered freedom tires ; I feel the weight of chance desires : My hopes no more must change their name , I long for a repose which ever is the same . " Not to have felt the call of duty , not to have recognized the awful and yet sweet dignity of the possession of a conscience , not to have asked of an invisible spiritual Power , What shall I // do ? is to have remained behind the possibilities of a maturing manhood . Furthermore , this is a question which the great and good of all ages have made supreme ; while in its answer they have deliberately placed the control of conduct and the decision of destiny . In some low degree , and at least in some periods of life , it may almost be said that the asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among full-grown men . But , undoubtedly , a very great difference exists everywhere as respects the frequency with which the question of duty is raised ; and also as respects the significance attached to its answer . Multitudes live in such a low sodden condition of intellect that they scarcely ever make very clearly any inquiry after a rational form of life . They eat , sleep , work , amuse themselves , if the conditions which surround them arc not too hard , and propagate their kind , and die , with only rare , if any , appeals to any source for an answer to Paul 's question . The question of many others , intelligent , gifted and prosperous , is one put to nature and to their surroundings as to how they may get most of happiness for themselves in life . They live for themselves . If they live at all for others , it is only as these others are related to their own plans for the realization of some selfish conception of life . But it is unnecessary either to argue , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has really agreed to call great and good , the question has rather been , what ought I to do ? What shall I do that is right and faithful to some reasonable ideal of duty ! And oftener than otherwise they have looked to the nvisible spiritual presence with the inquiry , Lord , may I know from thee , what I shall do ? l*That has been true of individuals has also been true of nations and of epochs of history . The great peoples of the earth have had a strong effusion of duty in their national ideals . Patriotism , service of the com , mon weal in fidelity to moral considerations , thoughts of honor and of high , noble living , emotions and aspirations devoting the individual to some conscientious course of action , conduct that springs from and confirms sound and lofty character ,  --  these things have been the very life-blood of the nations . Great epochs of human history have been characterized in the same way . True there is a power " not ourselves " which makes for righteousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations ; and there is a " wind of destiny " that shakes the tree till the fruit of national greatness falls . But after all , the old-time Hebrew saying has always remained true ; it is righteousness that exalts a people . It is when her citizens chiefly recognize the call of duty , the divine saci*edness of conscience , that the state is strong and great . Such were the characteristics of those epocks in which the republics of Greece were born ; such also the soil on which the great Roman Commonwealth sprung into being . Preeminently such were those stern and awful times when modern England was forming under Puritan action controlled by Puritan conceptions of duty as the voice of God . And he knows nothing aright of the origins of our own nation , who does not chiefly know of it that its foundations were laid , and its walls reared , by men who asked of God what they should do . Their devotion to duty may have amounted to a fanaticism ; their conceptions of what is duty were undoubtedly quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance and peerless rank which they gave to the question itself , that has made America free and strong and great . I am scarcely old enough to tell you , in wise and convincing fashion , how much better than now were the times when I was young . And croaking over the degeneracy of the age , if it were ever in fit place , would not be so here and on this occasion . But I will raise a few questions whose consideration must occupy every thoughtful man . Does duty , " Stern daughter of the voice of God , " hold the position as a ruling idea in our national life which it formerly held ? Do men in high places of political trust evince , as did the leaders of the public life of our forefathers , the earnest purpose to discharge this trust , as God would have them do ? Is conscience on the throne-I will not say really , but even apparently to be honored-in the estimate of the people at large ? If in those olden days the men of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on grounds of aVowed moral principle , they ought not to submit to taxation without a voice in the law ; who now thinks of putting questions of tariff and trusts and syndicates on an open ethical basis , or of protesting against unjust legislation chiefly as a matter of immorality rather than of mere inexpediency , or of finding the remedy in a course of conduct which sacrifices votes rather than escapes pecuniary loss by adroit smuggling . And how is it with this " stern daughter of // the voice of God , " in the life of the family ? Certainly the Puritan family life has now nearly if not quite entirely vanished from the land . Much that was unlovely and harsh there may have been about this life ; and yet much more that was tender and winsome than is now ordinarily supposed . But it certainly set conscience on high ; it made the doing of duty , the bringing of the life " to heel "  --  to use Mr. Huxley 's expression-under the dominion of moral law , the supreme end of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard God as the source and arbiter of righteousness , and to inquire of Him , in all seriousness at every turn of one 's personal affairs : What wilt thou have me to do ? There is more culture in the family life of the descendants of these Puritan men and women . The standard of education has been greatly raised . Many rude and some immoral customs and practices have been abated or banished . Children are better fed and clothed ; they are more at home , in proximity to , or within the fold of , the Christian church . The too exclusive and harsh presentation of duty as the sole spring and guide of youthful life had its injurious effects . But-how about the other side ? Are the young really better for being allowed constantly to ask themselves , What should I like to do ? rather than being frequently compelled to face the question , What ought I to do ? And is there no great significance for growing manhood in the habit of taking the question of duty before the invisible and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will confess that my heart sinks within me when I see how **30;453;TOOLONG national lifecommercial , political , and even ecclesiastical-has now become ! I am filled with alarm when I see the great body of the nation 's youth  --  the young men and the maidens of the land-living lives devoted to seeking pleasure and profit for themselves rather than lives inspired by the wish to learn the answer to the question What shall I do ? 0 do thou tell me that , my God and my King . Of one thing there can be no doubt . If the public and family life of the nation is to be absolved from the control of enlightened and devout conscientiousness , then the very pith and substance of our national greatness is certain to depart . Further : this question of Paul reveals a side of human nature which opens toward the Infinite . Think for one moment how marvelous is the capacity disclosed merely by asking such a question as this . Man may take God for his guide . Some flowers turn // li/n*ver8ity fJ'qpic8 . Nov. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful molecular mechanism . Flowers and sun are alike parts of one universal mechanical whole . But when man turns to God with the the inquiry , what shall I do ? he shows a capacity which lifts him out of this universal mechanism , He shows that his nature is of a spiritual and truly divine sort . He shows that God may be with him and in him , his redeemer , councilor , and friend . He shows a capacity for becoming a child of God . This inquiry , What shall I do , Lord ? is then a supreme sign and test of spiritual manhood . It indicates a movement which may end by bringing him who asks it into the very bosom of God . Another obvious and even more important truth suggested by these words of Paul is the following This question of his illumines , strengthens , purifies , and elevates one 's manhood . It not only , by its mere existence , bears witness to manhood ; it also greatly affects manhood . Merely to make the inquiry favorably influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover , receive , and follow the answer , this inquiry is the salvation of manhood , For the salvation of manhood consists in having it made clear , and strong , and pure , and high . And it is such manhood that this questionwhen constantly and rightly asked and ans ' *ered-brings to pass . Even to ask of God what one ought to do enlightens the soul . Only those who have had large experience know how doubtful much of the conduct of life inevitably is . Childhood and youth have comparatively few doubts about the proper course of action under all the simple relations of their daily lives . But the more we have of importance to do , and the more important it becomes what we do , the less plain it often seems precisely what should be done . It is not always the ignorant , it is often the most wise , who earnestly ask : What shall 1 do ? No one is so sure just how the teaching ought to be done , as he who has never taught . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he who has never had any children to govern . None of the friends of this University are quite so full of self-confident counsels concerning the management of its affairs , as those who know least about the difficulties of such management . Life , even the simplest life , is not an obvious affair . At best , it is often far too complicated for our confident handling ; at worst , it becomes infinitely complicated . So true is this that I // should not for a moment think of promising , even to him who honestly endeavors to follow only the rule of duty , that the path of duty will always be made plain . This is by no means the case . Much of the choicest culture , as well as much of the severest trial and bitterest pain of this life of ours comes in the effort to find out what duty is . He who always asks of God , What shall I do ? and who bends his ear , no matter how attentively and obediently to catch the answer ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him who never even raises the question which concerns the divine will as to his duty , there is no genuine light to shine upon the path of life . He is doomed to an unillumined life . He may act with shrewdness , with intelligence , with the probability of a certain large success . But the real lamp of his manhood has not yet been set in its place . It is the primary submission of the soul to the supremacy of duty which opens the gates of light . The whole universe is dark , and its meaning and end a hopeless riddle , unless moral ideas are allowed to pour upon it their heavenly light . So does every man find his own life , the significance and final purpose of it , a tormenting puzzle , unless he makes the rule of his conduct to be the following of duty 's law . For even to bring the question of doing before a divinely guided conscience is to get light on.one 's place in the world . And the oftener the question is raised , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ralse judgments , aud mistaken actions based upon them , after we let the daylight into our rooms . So after we ask of God , what shall I do ? we may err in judgment and in conduct ; but we have at least thrown open toward the sun the dwelling of our souL This question of the apostle Paul also strengthens manhood . Inquiry into the phenomena of the physical universe convinces us how weak is man both as respects his powers of body and also as regards his wisdom in fathoming the secrets of nature . But even to inquire , and especially to inquire of God , after a rule of duty both reveals and increases the strength of man . A certain noble gentleman , whom Yale University will always honor , is said-albeit with the genuine modesty which always characterized his words about himself : - " I do not believe there is power enough in the universe to make me tell a lie . " Yes that is the truth as to the real , the supreme and indomitable strength of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you // may poison my blood with microscopic germs ; you may take from me wealth , health , position , friends ; you may depreciate the choicest fruits of my intellectual labor ; and I may be quite too weak successfully to resist . But there is a realm of my manhood where I am strong . There is a place where I can stand alone , and stand against the whole world , if I only stand with God . There is a power of which no man can rob us , an inner citadel which no earthly potentate can conquer or possess . And it is this question of the Apostle Paul which reveals the source of such unconquerable personal power . And as I have already said , the habitual raising of the question of duty before God not only shows the strength of manhood ; it also makes men strong . They who habitnally ask what shall I do , in order to enjoy myself , or in order to win the favor of others , or in order to get wealth , fame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , What ought I to do ? What , Lord , wilt thou have me to do ? thereby grow strong . And they grow pure as well as strong ; for this question purifies the human soul . It defiles conduct , and soils and smirches character , to be continually asking : How can I have a good time ? How can I best enjoy myself ? How can I get the most of pleasure , favor , money , fame ? As it seems to me  --  and so I have already said  --  the prevalence of these questions and their supremacy over the question of duty , is polluting the sources of our national life . Search for the causes of open crimes and secret sins and vices , that prevail in the various grades of social life . The causes assigned and obvious are many ; the real cause is everywhere one and the same . It is because doing is not brought under the rule of duty ; because action does not follow after the question , how to act , has been asked of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such an inquiry as that of Paul fail to have a purifying effect upon one 's manhood ? The question itself brings one before the source of all purity , before the searcher of the human heart for what is impure , the detector and avenger of every form of wrong . Rarely will any essentially impure action enter the life of him who constantly raises the question of duty ; who daily asks of the invisibli* , pure and holy presence : what then shall I do ? But , finally , this question elevates our manhood . In the light of what has already been said , it is not difficult to see how this is so . Above the material world , above every other form of am .. mal life , above the mean and selfish of human kind , above himself // and as a child of the Source of all righteousness and moral truth , does he stand who places himself under the full influence of this inquiry . But its elevating influence upon the manhood I would , for a moment , emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call of duty which has always seemed to thinkers to characterize this call as coming from " on high . " It summons our lives upward . Appetites , passions , and desires are indeed necessary sources of human action . But unless they are under the control of conscience they are rightly regarded as degrading to manhood . The " word of the Lord " came to me , is the formula for the old prophetic call : from time immemorial conscience has been regarded as the " voice of God . " A heavenly uplifting vision , a summons to rise , to climb higher , is always connected with the triumph of duty in the soul of man . It is by the successive uplifts of such summons that character is exalted above the realm where selfishness and passion have control . Men and brethren , we are standing together on the threshold of another University year . The limits of much of our action are chiefly laid down by others ; the impulses to act at all come in part from considerations over which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the appetites , passions , and desires common to all men . Thus far the question what shall I do ? is answered for Os , rather than by us . It would not be out of the way to say that God himself has already answered it by making our surroundings and impulses such as they are . But there is still a wide region for every one of us , within which our choice is to be consulted . Here action becomes moral conduct , worthy of moral praise or blame , and nature unfolds herself into good or bad character . Here we can follow safely no other voice than that of God speaking in our consciences ; we can discharge the blame of mistake and failure upon no other one than ourselves ; we can plead no temptation from within or from without , from custom of the community , or law of the faculty , or urgency of friends , to clear our own souls from the burden of responsibility . Here we stand alone with God . This loneliness of each one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the danger , to the possibilities and to the promise , that are inseparably connected with being indeed a man . I have thus far made no effort to indicate , what in my judgment God wishes any one of us to be and to do . I have not even said that conscientious industry , fidelity , truthfulness , honor , purity , and brotherly love , are demanded by this University of // all her sons . Paul says of his experience : " They that were with me beheld indeed the light but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me . " In this community there is for all of us , in common with all others , much of light ; but besides this common light , each one of us must hear for himself the voice , unheard by others , of which he may say : It is the voice that speaks to me . I most earnestly and affectionately urge you , each one for himself , to ask for and to listen for , to hear and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a community like ours there is perhaps special need of this , if the choicest things of manhood are to be attained and preserved . I recognize the charm which is thrown around University life in the form of customs , of little value or significance in themselves , but made valuable and significant by association with things and men which we innocently and tenderly admire and love . I will yield to no one in respect of the claim to a peculiar affection and jealous care for all that goes to constitute the type of manhood cultivated here . At the same time no intelligent friend of Yale can fail to recognize the fact that customs exist , cherished by the student sentiment , which moral reason , when allowed to utter its voice , pronounces foolish and absurd if not seriously injurious to manly character and very positively wrong . And that there are habits rife in our community , as there are in every similar community , which he who listens to God 's voice will shun for himself and oppose in others , no rightthinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , I simply ask you to raise , at once and constantly , this question of the Apostle Paul . This is the same thing as to say , I advise you to put the inquiry after duty upon the throne , and to seek the answer to this inquiry from that source whence flow all ' the light and truth and noble impulse which influence human lives . Thus , and only thus , shall we show ourselves to be men . Thus , and only thus , shall we become worthy to have a place among the truly great and good . This , and this only , will make our manhood bright , and strenuous , and pure , and lofty . Follow not the multitude unless you are sure that , in going with them , you follow your conscience to where God calls you . Listen not to the voices which urge you to turn this way or that , unless you have first heard the voice that speaks to you alone , and speaks in answer to your honest and prayerful inquiry : Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , Sept. 24th , 1891.
