About 2 o'clock this afternoon Gov . Clarke called at Gleason 's Hotel , where he met Jones in the lobby . He requested a private interview with Jones , in order that he might have an understanding with him . Jones replied that he would go nowhere with him , and that If he had any business with him he could transact it where they were . This angered the Governor , and he spat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor , who drew a pistol , but was prevented from shooting by several bystanders . Clarke was arrested by a constable , but was released on his own recognizance . The Governor will plead guilty tomorrow in a Justice 's court to assault Murderer Gregory May Live . Jesse M.
