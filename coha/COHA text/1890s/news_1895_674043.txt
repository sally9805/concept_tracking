Cooper lost their lives . Coroner Kene heard a number of witnesses , while Coroner-elect Edward B. Coombs sat at his side and took a deep interest in the proceedings . The testimony was heard by the two juries , and after it was all in the jurors went to separate rooms , where they considered the cases . The jury in the case of Georgic Granito found that he came to his death Nov. 19 by shock due to the injuries he had received on the bridge , and that the accident was due to the neglect of the bridge authorities in not having proper safeguards for the running of trains during foggy weather . In the case of Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shock , " and in our opinion , " said the jurors , " the safeguards used to protect life by the management in foggy weather are entirely inadequate . We consider three flagmen insufficient to handle the immense traffic on cars in such weather . " Several lawyers were present and were taking notes to be used in suits which are to be brought against the Bridge Trustees. by the relatives of the men who were killed . Peter Schaefer of 511 Sixth Street , this city , the conductor on the train that crashed into the rear car of the forward train , who escaped serious injury , was the first to take the witness stand . He said he was on the forward car . The fog was so dense that a person ten feet away could not be seen . " I heard Officer Brady , " he said , " shout ' Schaefer , look out ! ' I then gave the signal to slow up , and we slowed up at the signal box at the anchorage . Then the signal was given as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The cars came in at a good rate of speed , when Flagman Swaney , with a red lantern signaled me to stop , but the crash came before they could stop . " Schaefer said that he was thrown on the platform , and when he got up saw what had happened , and that he then got down to the roadway and walked to the station . He said that he had been laid off since  --  that is , he had been suspended  --  but no reason was given for his suspension . He said that be had not seen the red lights on the rear car of the front train . He did not see them , because he did not have time to look . The rule was for the ' conductor on the rear car , in case of an accident , to get off , run up the track , and give the danger signal . Charles G. Swaney , conductor , said that he was sent out to get signals on the trestle . He took the red and white lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw Cooper 's train . It came in slowly , and he feared there would be trouble . He went down the track and signaled Schaefer and then ran back and found the conductor on the rear car had left to signal the following train . " The fog rolled right down , " he said , " and out in the mist I could see Schaeffer 's train . It was only ten feet away . When I signaled Schaeffer , the two trains were about 150 feet apart . " William Plunkett of 60 Fulton Street , who walked across the bridge the morning of the accident , said he was first attracted to the bridge cars by hearing two men talking . One of the men had two lights and the other one . One of the men said : " These lights are no good , " and the other said : " No , these lights are no good . Let 's go . " Plunkett said that he looked on in horror at the train approaching . He declared that Schaeffer appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not show any emotion . Cooper , he said , was laughing when the crash came . Thomas Hackett , a conductor on the train that was run into , said he could see at least Ufty feet in advance . Cooper , he said , had ample time to have left the train . He said Cooper did not have time to open the gate , and get down and go back to signal the approaching train . Edwin S. Ross , who was in charge of the train on which Cooper was killed , said his train entered the Brooklyn station slowly , having stopped several times , but having received the white light signal he went into the station . He knew nothing about the accident until he felt his train struck . Samuel S. Thierer testified that he , being the conductor on the rear car of the train preceding Ross 's train , jumped off and ran back to stop Ross 's train . The train was stopped , and Ross was picked up . Under the rules he went back to the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the platform , but he was surPrised at finding Conductor Cooper there . " Why did n't you get off ? " the conductor asked Cooper . " I did n't think it was necessary , " replied Cooper . The witness then returned to-the front of his train . Conductors Kennedy , Cooley , and Swany were recalled . They said they had not made any . znch remarks as were attributed to them by the witness , Plunkett.
