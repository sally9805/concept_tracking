txt Dr. J. JULIO HENNA , a Commissioner from Puerto Rico to the capital of the Government of which Puerto Rico is a province of some sort , asks the President some questions which seem to be very pertinent , which are put in admirable temper , arid which every citizen of the United States must admit are entitled to a candid and kind answer . Dr. HENNA is now a Spanish-speaking American , a Puerto Rican who accepts without regret , so far as can be discovered from his words , peace with annexation But he is also a patriot and a statesman who knows something of the rights of an American citizen and who sustains the reasonable belief that the Constitution is strong enough to bear any strain that may be put upon it by stretching it over his fellow-countrymen . With a keen analysis of our acts since annexation was accomplished , Dr. HENNA makes out an argument from which attempt to escape will be at once dishonest and discreditable to us . Puerto Rico , he insists , having been annexed , is wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to the protection of the Constitution , made not for a few or for large classes , but for all . Dr. HENNA makes requests for things which he and his fellow-citizens regard as essential to their comfort and happiness : Civil government and free trade ; civil rights and an American code of laws . This Puerto Rican appeal to the Administration anticipates the reply that it is not safe to accord civil government to the island because of disorders , and the refusal of free trade because it can not be afforded , with the reminder that starvation was unknown on the island before the arrival of our troops , even in Spanish times ; that American occupation has disturbed order and trade seriously , and that unless the people of Puerto Rico are permitted to dispose freely of their productions , now perishing on , the shores of the island , worse conditions must follow bad . There seems to be little ground for doubting that Dr. HENNA 'S demands for his fellow-citizens must in part , at least , be granted . He directs attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is power in Washington to prescribe the rules of trade between Puerto Rico and Cuba and . the United States , and that the Island of Puerto Rico has teen treated , in the making of several proclamations , as if it were a part of the United States , subject to the Constitution as completely as if it were one of the States . And as the order of revocation issued on April 24 restored certain shipping privileges previously withdrawn , Dr. HENNA assumes that the power to unmake resides at the head of the Government , just as does the power to impose regulations . This appeal of the would-be independent citizens of Puerto Rico has some manly lines in it . Dr. HENNA would not have the citizens of the United States in Puerto Rico pauperized by the distribution of rations , a practice hitherto unknown and now greatly deplored . From beginning to end it is a cry to be helped to become self-sustaining and self-respecting and loyal citizens under our flag . " Try us for a month , " Dr. HENNA says , substantially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tried , whether we deserve to be still further encouraged . " Why will not the President exercise the right , take advantage of the opportunity , to try the experiment which Dr. HENNA believes to be so full of promise for his people ? He would have free trade with Cuba and . Spain as well ' as with the United States , for the reason that with those countries Puerto Rico has chiefly traded . There is no doubt that the President may grant free trad4 between Puerto Rico and the United States . Dr. HENNA has shown that inferentially , or at least the Administration has asserted that it may grant free trade between Cuba and Puerto Rico if it chooses to do so . To refuse these boons , the refusal of which threatens to deepen the pauperism in Puerto Rico dreaded by Dr. HENNA , because we can not afford it , is , as Dr. HENNA points out , a matter which ought to have been taken into consideration earlier , and he reproaches us fairly when he insists that to punish the Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United , States .
