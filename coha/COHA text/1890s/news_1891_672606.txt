txt The largest pulp mill of the Remington Paper Company , about two miles below this city , was almost totally destroyed late last night by the high water , causing damages requiring abona$50,000 to repair and killing John Murphy , an employe , aged sixty-eight . Eleven nulp grinders , the wheel , and various other machinery werecarried down the river . While the machinery had been shut down for a few minutes to make some repairs the floor suddenly began to rise and the whole building moved . Then with a crash a pert of the building and machinery fell into the river and the roof fell down on the remaining machinery . The workmen rushed for the doors , and all etioaped except Murphy and Thomas Stevens , who were struck by the shafting and crushed to the floor , Stevens succeeded in extricating himself , and made a perilous trip over the broken roof hanging over the water . Murphy was terribly crushed and probably died instantly . The accident will not interfere with the company 's output from its paper mills . POLITICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature , the passage of which , its projectors say , would eventually result in enriching the common-school fund of the State to the extent of several million dollars . The hill proposes that the State shall call upon the . Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad for the payment of whatever amount of money it may be found the railroad owes the State , in accordance with the terms of its charter , granted in 1847 . The charter provided that a certain share of the earnings of the road shall be paid over to the Treasurer of the State for the benefit of the common schools , but up to the present the State has not had benefit to the extent of a penny from this charter provision . It is claimed by the officials of the railroad that the State has no claim upon their company , and that this would appear to the satisfaction of any intelligent commission - which should investigate the matter .

Pass the Shipping bill and give this land ocean trade ! " Thus starts off the Philadelphia Press 's Sunday editorial page . It is hardly necessary to say that we have in this paragraph an excellent example of the non sequitur . The Press would have been quite as logical had it laid the foundation of its demand for steamship subsidies in a statement that neither elephants nor bricks can climb trees . It the country is doing what the Press says that it is doing , it can afford to wait for ships until people can profitably sail them independent of Government aid . The Indianapolis Journal is very much distressed because somebody has intimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South and West , Mr. Harrison will only succeed in showing to the people who see him and hear him talk that he is an all-around small man .

Probably the man who wrote this sentence has never heard Talmage , or Sam Jones , or seven Joe Cook , and is unable to compare the President 's oratory with the best American standards . There never was a countryman yet who did not consider the leading lawyer of his village just a trifle the greatest man living . The Albany ( Ga . ) News and Advertiser has been greatly impressed by Mr. Cleveland 's recent silver letter .

" The St. Louis Globe-Democrat , Republican , recently said : " The Congress which expires a little over a week hence has done more harm to the party controlling it than almost any other Congress in the Nation 's history . " There is a shocking amount of perversity in this way of putting the ease . It is the country that Congress has hurt , and if the Globe-Democrat is in a sympathizing mood it should recognize this fact , and not sorrow over the downfall of a party which tho good of the country demanded should go down . " Never before have Americana flung to the breeze on Washington 's Birthday flags bearing forty-four stars , each of them representing a sovereign State , " exclaims the New-Haven Palladium . It may be still further remarked that there were very few forty-four-star flags flying even this Washington 's Birthday .

The editor of the Jackson ( Miss . ) ClarionLedger wants the members of the Mississippi Constitutional Convention called together again so that they may burn up " the thing they have promulgated , " begin anew , amend the old Constitution in a simple way , and submit their recommendations to the people for ratification or rejection . The editor says that he will give $100 in gold for the discovery of a man who really understands the new Constitution . The country editors down in Mississippi must be very rich men . Neal Dow , whom the Maine backwoodsmen speak of as the " great prohybitionist , " is very active this year in the cause which is nearest to his heart . He is urging upon the Maine Legislature the adoption of a certain amendment to the prohibitory law providing that a first offense shall be punished by a fine of $5,000 and a year 's imprisonment .

" THE THOMAS CONCERT . There were several interesting novelties at the Thomas concert at the Lenox Lyceum last night , the last of these concerts till April 5 . One of these was Mr. H. R. Shelley 's " Suite , " conducted by the composer , a well-wrought and musicianly performance , of which the " Oriental Serenade " is the most taking movement , and perhaps the most creditable , in spite of a rather too forcible reminder of Rubinstein 's " Bat Costume " in the orchestral treatment . Miss Heilner played with the orchestra Grieg 's concerto for piano with clear and adequate execution and with sympathetic insight . Miss Little , a contralto with a fresh voice and a good style , sang Gluck 's " Che ' era senza Euridice " by no means in such wise as to efface the recollection of Annie Louise Cary 's rendering of it , but , nevertheless , acceptably , and followed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red , Red Rose , " which she sang so as to indicate that ballad singing was her forte , an impression that was confirmed by her performance later of songs by Secohi and Brahma . Signor Campanini 's number excited more curiosity than any other on the programme , since " Adelaide , " was one of them , and " the song of songs " generally fares ill when it falls among Italian tenors . In his first Benz the great teller 's voice seemed much less fresh and clear than at the previous concert , but he sang out alathe huskiness before Adelaide " came and he sang it in excellent voice and style , and in spite of one or two too violent transitions with a respect and discretion that made the performance enjoyable and memorable . With so many soloists the only serious - work the orchestra had to do , excepting the Shelley " Suite " and its part in the Grieg concerto , was the selection from Berlioz 's " Romeo and Juliet , " and this was not only admirably but faultlessly played . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
