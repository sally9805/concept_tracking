txt Senator Quay has Found a way te bring the debate on the Tariff bill to an end " within and with it the end of the present long session . " The Pennsylvania Senator announced this discovery to the Senate late this afternoon in the shape of a series of resolutions which he offered , and which , at his request , were laid upon the table , to be called up at what Mr. Edmunds would call " some suitable time . " In these resolutions Mr. Quay provides that during the rest of thin session the Senate will consider no legislative business except the pendpag Tariff bill , General Appropriation bills , Public Building bills , Pension bills , and Senate or joint resolutions . All other measures are to be postponed until the next session . The voting on the Tariff bill and amendments thereto is to begin at 2 o'clock , Aug. 30 , and continue until the measure is disposed of Mr. Quay 's resolutions were not - wholly - unexpected on the Democratic side of the chamber , and some of the Republienne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The leeeneyleenia Senator had had a long confidential conversation - with Mr. German earlier in the day , and there is good reason to believe that the Maryland Senator was then informed of the action Mr. Quay intended to suggest to get the Republicans out of the tangle they have been making thicker day by day . Democratic Senators are as little inclined as the Republicans to talk about a e deal " between the parties as to what shall be done for the rest of the session , but there are Democratio Senators who predict , with a good deal of confidence , that the Quay resolutions will be adopted - whenever Mr. Quay calls them up for consideration . These Senators say that the Democratic view of the Tariff bill can be sufficiently elaborated by Aug. 30. and it goes without saying that they find no fault with the set-back to the Force bill involved in the passage of the resolutions . Just how much support the Quay proposal has upon the Republican side is not yet known , but it is believed that there are from six to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and that is a suffieientnumber to put it through . It has , however , some determined opponents among the majority . Some of them think that good politics requires them at least to debate the Force bill , and Mr. Hoar insists that that measure must be passed . To those who know his standing in the Senate it is not surprising that some opposition to the resolutions springs from the mere fact that hr . Quay introduced them . Several Senators who were consulted about the scheme gave it their indorsement , supposing it was to be introduced by a Western Senator . They were surprised and annoyed when Quay stepped to the trent , and they speak resentfully of what they consider his uncalled-for prominence in the matter . They are the ; men who think that the less Mr. Quay poses as a leader , the better it will be for their party . The resolutions are expected to receive some support from Senators who do not favor a rule to limit debate , and who can vote for them on the ground that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easiest possible way . One or two members of the Finance Committee are said to be well disposed toward the resolutions . Mr. Hoar , however , is reported to be highly indignant over such an open revolt against his pet Force bill , and Mr. Spooner is credited with the same hostility to any idea of dropping that outrageous measure . Two other proposals calculated to hasten the close of the session came from the Republicans to-day . One was the Edmunds scheme , to cut down tariff speeches to five minutes each , introduced yesterday , and withdrawn because Mr. Morgan complained of the way in which Mr. Edmunds obtained the floor . The Vermont Senator presented it again in the morning hour , and without any discussion it was laid on the table to await his pleasure . The other was a fresh resolution by Mr. Blair , providing a rule under which the previous question may be demanded upon any proposition which has been under consideration for two days- It followed the Edmunds order and was laid upon the table . Neither of the proposals now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators have taken time to talk the subject over . Little groups of them were chatting about it all day to-day , and a decision is expected very soon . Some of the Senators who are interested in the River and Harbor bill wanted to know if that was to be shut out by the Quay resolutions . The Pennsylvania Senator assured them that it could come in under the head of Appropriation bills . The Louisiana Lottery lobby is about the only one left in the House corridors nowadays , and it is very busy . Its members are pretty well known to everybody , as most of them have been in the employment of the company for many years . Hitherto they have managed to prevent a vote on any bill in both houses at one session . They will try it again . A roll call on the bill which Mr. Bingham has kept so long in committee ' would be useful before the nominating conventions have all been held . Some of the friends of Postmaster General Wanamaker admit that the proposition to extend his discretion over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not misused the discretion he already enjoys to prohibit the " Kreutzer Sonata . " The imminent possibility of a vote in both houses on the Lottery bill is maidng a great many persons very uncomfortable . Visitors to the National Museum were to-day detained at the door of the lecture hall of the museum if they were not provided with tickets of admission and were not permitted to enter that part of the hall , usually open to the public . It seems that the National Photographers ' Association , which had procured the use of the hall free of expense and upon the condition that it was to be freely open to the public , had forgotten entirely the understanding upon which it had obtained the use of it . There are plenty of halls in the city to be had for money , and this hall is one from which the general public ought not to be excluded at any time . Representative Reyburn of Philadelphia , the late Judge William D. Kelly 's successor , said to-day that he indorsed the sentiments expressed by Senator Cameron against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bill in the House as a party measure , but that it did not meet the approval of his judgment . He says that it originated in the craze for ballot retorm , and that it was taken up by Mr. Lodge and others as a matter of abstract principle without regard to its political effects . Practical politicians like Quay viewed the matter in a somewhat different light In Mr. Reyburn 's opinion the question of undue representation of the Bourbon element at the South must be worked out by natural causes , and will eventually be controlled by the increase of population at the Northwest and Northern immigration into the South . Senator Blair , in behalf of the majority members of the Woman 's Suffrage Committee , to-day reported favorably a proposed Constitutional amendment to give women the right of suffrage . Senator Blair , in a report accompanying the bill says : " Prejudice and custom have denied to women the suffrage , but it is impossible to give a reason for the exercise of suffrage by men which does not apply with equal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ship for service on coastwise vessels will no longer be able lawfully to refuse to do duty when ordered to do so by the masters of vessels . The House , this afternoon , passed a bill , which had been passed by the Senate in - June , defining the reciprocal duties of master and seaman . The act of 1S72 provided for the manner of shipment of seamen upon vessels in the foreign trade , and under this act it was made necessary that ' seamen should be shipped before Shipping Commissioners ; that while in service they should be entitled to certain privileges , and the masters should be bound by their agreements . An act passed in 1874 particularly stipulated that none of the provisions of the act of 1872 should apply to vessels in the coastwisetrade . The reason for now applying the law to all vessels is the complaint that seamen have taken advantage of their exemption under the law applicable to vessels in the foreign trade , and have refused to do duty . In March , 1SSS , six sailors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . charged with disobedience and disorder , and were discharged on the ground that there was no law by which the acts complained of could be punished- In May , 1359 , four refractory seamen , who had signed before a Shipping Commissioner for duty on the schooner Governor Hall , were arrested by harbor police and taken before Commissioner Edmunds of Philadelphia for a hearing . They were dis e4 , * It Is learned that the Venezuela Claims Commission , authorized by the last Congress and appointed by President Harrison soon after he took office , has completed its investigation of the subject that it was directed to examine and it will soon make a report to the President . The commission consists of ex-Representative J. V. L. Findlay of Maryland , ex-Representative Little of Ohio , and a representative of Venezuela . The necessity for this commission grew out of the finding of a committee of the House in the Fortyfifth Congress that the commission of 1868 was incompetent ; that some of the claims allowed by it were questionable in character ; that the proceedings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be declared invalid . Venezuela held back its payments of the awards . In 1880 Secretary of State Everts advised . Congress , if it was not prepared to enforce payment of the awards , to Make an investigation to determine - which ones it wouldinsist upon , and - which yield . President Arthur intimated in 1882 that if Congress did . not net in the matter he should feel constrained . to terminate the controversy by recognizing the validity of the awards . Secretary Frelinghuysen so advised , and thought the awards should stand as valid . *Under President Cleveland the Government of Venezuela reopened the matter , in diplomatic negotiations , encl. - finally concluded to be satisfied with the verdict of a commission , one member of which was to be named by Venezuela , an- other by the State Department and the President , and the third by the two already selected by the United States and Venezuela . The understanding of those who have heard of the character of the findings of the commission is that they have decided that the whole issue of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was invalid . These certificates were denounced in the report of the Congressional investigation as being issued recklessly and fraudulently . They have , it is said , been used by some of their confident holders in payment of current expenses for years . Among the claimants who went before the commission-in 1868 were representatives of the Aspin*elle of New-York . They refused to take an offer to allow theft claim upon the receipt of 50 per cent of the amount in certificates , the assumption being that the commission was to get hall of the claim . This claim , then , rejected by the commission , is , it is understood , recommended for payment as a proper obligation . The total amount of claims in controversy is about a million and a half dollars . The findings of the new commission ought to be interesting , if they are anything like those suggested here , to Mr. Springer , who was amongthose who most vigorously opposed the payment of the awards of the mixed commission . Venezuela has apparently done well by holding off until the matter could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
