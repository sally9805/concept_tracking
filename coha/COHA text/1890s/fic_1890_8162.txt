Cooke , Rose Terry , 1827-1892 : ABRAHAM LINCOLN . from Abraham Lincoln ( 1890 ) " STRANGULATUS PRO REPUBLICA . " Hundreds there have been , loftier than their kind , Heroes and victors in the world 's great wars : Hundreds , exalted as the eternal stars , By the great heart , or keen and mighty mind ; There have been sufferers , maimed and halt and blind , Who bore their woes in such triumphant calm That God hath crowned them with the martyr 's palm ; And there were those who fought through fire to find Their Master 's face , and were by fire refined . But who like thee , oh Sire ! hath ever stood Steadfast for truth and right , when lies and wrong Rolled their dark waters , turbulent and strong ; Who bore reviling , baseness , tears and blood Poured out like water , till thine own was spent , Then reaped Earth 's sole reward  --  a grave and monument ! Rose Terry Cooke Winsted , 1882.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
