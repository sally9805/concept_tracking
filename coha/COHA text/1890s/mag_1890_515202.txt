THE EVOLUTION OF HUMOR . BY PROFESSOR S. H. BUTCHER , LL.D . TWO psychological facts have , more than any others , offered resistance  --  to evolutionary theory , the sense of the sublime and the sense of the ludicrous ; and of these the ludicrous in particular , to which I will now confine myself , How has this perception aided the survival of the fittest ? In its developed form it is easy to see how it may ally itself with other faculties and become a factor in progress . But , according to strict Darwinian doctrine , it must have had a utilitarian value at each and every stage of its growth ; otherwise it could not have come into being . The difficulty therefore presents itself when we go back to its early beginnings , and seek to connect them with the rudimentary wants of primitive man . What was the use of the ludicrous in the struggle for existence ? To the savage , life is earnest , roots are scarce , foes and reptiles are many . In Cooper 's novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes his way through the bush . He feels no inclination to awake tigers by peals of laughter . // Such conditions of life do not develop a genial sense of humor . Nor can we wonder at a tribe in Ceylon , the Veddabs , who had never been known to laugh , and who , when asked why they never laughed , gave the good reason that they saw nothing to laugh at . What , then , was the use of laughter to early man ? An attempt has been recently made by more than one writer to resolve the ludicrous into an emotion of pure malignity , man 's disinterested delight in the infliction of suffering . This is , in fact , a revival of the theory of Hobbes , whose words , though well known , I will here recall : " The passion of laughter is nothing else but sudden glory , arising from a sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves , by comparison of the infirmity of others , or with our own formerly . For men laugh at the follies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except they bring with them any present dishonor . " Now , spiteful glee , though not in itself an emotion which tends to insure victory in the struggle for existence , yet is correlated to certain victorious qualities , such as strength of body or superiority of mind . It is not the laughter , but the faculty of which it is the accompaniment , that indicates success . We may observe a similar fact to-day among village rustics . One who is physically feeble , insignificant in appearance and stature , becomes a leading spirit , simply because he has got the gift of caustic speech . And in a primitive community and among backward people it can well be conceived how great a force would be wielded by a man of ready and sarcastic tongue . Ridicule would become one of the keenest of weapons . Among the Eskimo , we are told , there are no law courts , but public meetings for the settlement of all disputes , and for the punishment of all crimes , except such as involve a death penalty . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Counsel are not employed on either side , but in their stead the , friends of the litigants may sing in turn , if the principals are weary . The cheering and the dissent of the assembly express , as it were , the verdict of the court on the merits of the case . ( Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo , Rink . ) Doubtless , too , in savage jokes there is often a latent cruelty . A Murut chief was taking the oath of allegiance to the British North Borneo Coinpany , and was vowing to renounce headhunting and other like pastimes . " He was chopping away at the stick , repeating the oath in a loud voice . When he came to the part , May my wife die ' ( if ever I take another head ) , he stopped short and exclaimed , with a grim smile , I have no wife . You Peluans cut off her head long ago . ' And the Veluans gave a sort of laughter , in which he joined , the crowd around rolling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society , 1888 , page 21 . ) Even now malignity in its various manifestations enters into many forms of mirth . Derisive laughter accompanies not only the triumph over enemies , but the momentary discomfiture of friends ; for there is in civilized as in savage man " a something not wholly unpleasant in the misfortunes " ( or , rather , the minor misfortunes ) " of our friends . " The practical joke is an obvious survival of primitive malignity , toned down into playful malice . When nature fails to produce the minor mishaps of life , man or boy steps in and makes practical jokes to help out ( as Aristotle might say ) the design of nature . Where the modern school-boy ( who may be taken as a fair type of man in process of being evolved from the savage ) would play a practical joke on the body of his friend , his savage ancestor would dance over the body of his prostrate enemy and raise a laugh of victory . The barbaric and childish delight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pantomime , and in Punch and Judy . I remember being much struck at the representation of a play of Aristophanes , to observe how many jokes , once good ones , are now flat , but that one perennial joke remains which never fails to delight mankind  --  to see an actor kicked off the stage . Again , at a burlesque , such as the play entitled The Private Secretary , in laughing at the Curate we take our revenge for all the dull sermons and mumbling priests we have ever heard . That Curate is the vicarious sufferer for a world of parsons . Plato , in the Philebus , * gives us a subtle analysis of the pleasure of comedy . His view is essentially the same as that of Hobbes . According to him , the pleasure of the ludicrous is caused by the sight of another 's misfortune . But , with a far deeper insight than Hobbes , he points out * Philebus , pp. 48-50. // that the misfortune which provokes laughter is the self-ignorance ( c'iyroLa ) or folly of others ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly must be accompanied by an inability to hurt us . Fear casts out laughter . Powerless self-ignorance is the object of comic laughter . Among savages an ignorant breach of etiquette provokes merriment . An act which , if done by a native , would involve most serious penalties , and perhaps draw down the vengeance of the Great Spirit , is merely amusing when it arises from the foolish ignorance of a stranger . A New Zealander , for instance , will never lean his back against the wall of a house ; to do so is to break a " tapu " ; but if a European , entering the house of a native , leans his back against the wall , and ignorantly violates the sacred usage , the coinpany is highly amused . ( Traditions and Superstitions of the New Zealanders , Shortland , pp. 112-113 . ) Now the theory of malice as a constant ingredient of the ludicrous , though it admits of many applications , will not explain even primitive humor in all its forms . Certain kinds of jokes in which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at . Livingstone somewhere tells us of an African tribe who , when for the first time they were dressed in their clothes , rolled about upon the ground in fits of inextinguishable laughter over this novel situation . The New Zealanders used to divert themselves with a game in which a number of boys , ranged in a row , at a given signal stand on their heads and kick their heels in the air , keeping time with a song which they sing . ( Traditions , etc. , p. 157 . ) Similarly if a Samoan chief of importance went to a public meeting , he took in his train , we are told , one or two humorists , who , by oddity in dress , gait , or gesture , tried to excite laughter . ( Samoa , Turner , p. 129 . ) Nor are savages unacquainted with more intellectual forms of wit . They love making puns , and very bad ones . Much of their fun , again , consists in framing riddles , somewhat of this character : " Twenty brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer : " A man 's fingers and toes . " This is Samoan ingenuity . The following riddles are Albanian , but still in the savage manner : " Two brothers near together ; a mountain divides them . " Answer : " The eyes . " " Wood on this side , wood on that side , flesh in the middle . " Answer : " A child in its cradle . " " Wherever it goes , it writes on the wall with silver . " Answer : " A snail . " Numberless such riddles might be quoted which can scarcely raise a smile in us , and which certainly could not be guessed , as the points of resemblance are so remote that a hundred answers equally suitable might be invented . The propounder of such riddles might , on the malignant theory , possibly laugh ; but why should those who fail to answer them laugh on the same theory ? In truth , the pure pleasure of malice , though it enters into much savage laughter , can not be traced in all varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in savage mirth which resists this analysis . Malignant enjoyment can not be the ultimate explanation or single source of the ludicrous . Even if we take the pleasure arising from the degradation of others , we may see that , viewed as a source of comic enjoyment , it is of a complex character . There is , first , the pleasure taken in the suffering of others for its own sake ; and , secondly , the pleasure afforded by a sudden contrast , in this case a contrast between previous eminence and sudden humiliation . The pure ludicrous is not due to the gratified feeling of malignity , but to the discovery of this contrast . Still , the mere contrast is not generally piquant enough . The joke becomes all the better if it is made a little more pungent , and so it is usually seasoned with malice . Such is the well-known pun.on the word " Noman , " which is addressed to the blinded Cyclops in the Odyssey . Here the play on the name is not a pun pure and simple ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences . The pun on the word is highly flavored by the accompanying malice , and by the thought of the miserable plight in which the use of this witticism left the giant . In all such cases the laughter is primarily due not to malignity , but to a certain incongruity . Otherwise how account for the fact that genuine malignity , as distinguished from playful malice , generally finds other modes of expression than laughter ; also that great and painful reverses of fortune provoke not mirth , but pity ? The enjoyment with which we view the trivial mishaps of other men is at once expelled by the spectacle of real suffering . The primary source of the pleasure , then , is not in // the sight of suffering , but in a particular kind of contrast . Take away all malice , and laughter is still awakened . Among the earliest forms of comic literature is parody , whether the mock-heroic , where mean things are made ludicrous by dignity of language , or the burlesque , where great things are degraded by mean words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malice ? It would surely be far-fetched to maintain that we are enjoying a sympathetic triumph with the author of the parody over the original poet , who is perhaps dead and buried ; though Mr. Bain does go so far as to say that " much of the enjoyment of mankind arises from victimizing in idea the absent , the dead , and the imaginary . Doubtless the satisfaction would be still greater to see the sufferers writhing under the infliction ; but this has its drawbacks , in consequence of our possessing a tender and sympathetic as well as a malevolent side . " ( Bain , English Composition and Rhetoric , Part II. , p. 241 . ) Again , take the joke consisting in a surprise due to an unexpected turn given to the last words , in which so much of the humor of Aristophanes consists . Over whom do we here triumph when we laugh ? Whose is the discomfiture ? Not , surely , the poet 's . Do we then laugh at ourselves as being the victims of a species of practical joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might in certain cases laugh at ourselves an hour afterward when the annoyance of a disappointment has passed off ; but we could hardly laugh at the disappointed self of a second ago , the more so when the disappointment itself was pleasurable , not painful . A special form of this last kind of joke is the anticlimax , which answers pretty exactly to Kant 's definition of laughter as " an emotion arising from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing . " Mr. Bain says : " By the very nature of the case this is a species of humiliation or degradation . " But again we ask : Who is humiliated ? Can it be the person who is himself provoked to laughter ? A good instance of the anticlimax is a story ( unpublished , I believe ) - of Oliver Wendell Holmes , which I heard Mr. Lowell tell . Once upon a time everybody in the world agreed that at one and the same *noment they would all raise a shout which should reach the moon . Accordingly all clocks , watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and second . When the moment came , every one was watching and listening to hear the others shout , so no one shouted , except one deaf old woman in the Sandwich Islands . These instances are almost enough to show that malicious laughter does not account for all instances of the ludicrous . It will carry us along the line of development up to satire , in which there is an echo of triumphant laughter , a tone of scorn ; it will explain sarcasm , caricature , and irony ; but there it stops short . The pure comic eludes this analysis . Indeed , if Hobbes 's explanation were adequate , the man who laughs would resent the sight of hundreds of others laughing in his company , the egoistic glory of superiority being diminished in proportion as others share in it ; whereas , in fact , laughter is contagious , and the pleasure is intensified by being shared with others . Aristotle 's brief account of the ludicrous in the Poetics ( ch.v. ) is a step in advance of what Plato arrived at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is speaking with special reference to comedy . " The ludicrous , " he says , " is a defect or deformity that causes no pain or hurt ; as , for instance , the comic mask is deformed and distorted without causing pain . " The limitation expressed by the words " without pain or hurt " - either , that is , to the object of laughter , or sympathetically to the subject-is of profound importance , and must be always borne in mind as a necessary qualification . We laugh at a pompous alderman falling in the mud , or at a man running after his hat in the street ; but we do not laugh if some one is violently thrown from his horse . But even more significant is the omission in Aristotle of malice , in which Plato had found the essence of the ludicrous . Aristotle speaks of " ugliness , " " deformity , " and this , together with the word " defect , " will include not merely what is physically ugly , disproportionate , unsymmetrical ; not merely the frailties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its graver vices and crimes ; but also , if we take into account Aristotle 's views about beauty , the words may not unduly be extended to embrace the incongruities , absurdities , cross-purposes of life , its blunders and discords , its imperfect correspondences and adjustments , and that in matters intellectual as well as moral . // But Aristotle 's definition is still wanting in exactness ; for though the ludicrous is always incongruous , yet the incongruous ( even limited as he does limit it ) is not always ludicrous . Mere incongruity pains and jars us , if we simply contemplate it as such . We desire fitness , symmetry , adaptation , or our sense becomes blunted through familiarity , and the incongruity no longer strikes us . The most inharmonious combinations in time appear natural and fitting . Incongruity , in order to be ludicrous , implies a transition , a change of mood , resulting in the discovery either of an unexpected resemblance where there was unlikeness , or an unexpected unlikeness where there was resemblance . There is always a blending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without pain or hurt . " To " see a joke " means to discover the unexpected relation established by such a change of mental attitude . In some cases mere juxtaposition of material objects not usually united is sufficient to excite laughter . An unexpected combination of physical peculiarities strikes upon the senses . The mind passes rapidly from one group of objects to the other . They are brought together in thought by an instantaneous process . By the law of association their incongruities are discovered , and the discovery is immediate . But in most cases a more conscious mental operation is needed to establish the relation , from which an inference is then rapidly drawn-rapidly it must be , for a joke discovered after an hour 's mental agony ceases to be a joke . In Addison 's Spectator , No. 371 , we have an account of a wit at Bath who invited to dine with him half a score of men , all of them with long chins , whose " mouths were in the middle of their faces . " The ludicrous effect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men of a particular physical type , the specimens of which are generally kept apart in nature . The combination was intended to appear due to accidentto be a curious coincidence . If intentional , the rudeness would get the better of the absurdity . Here the apparent absence of conscious intention heightens the comic effect , if it is not essential to it . But in many instances the presumed presence of will and free intelligence is necessary to make a thing ludicrous , e. q. , in reading the lines of a newspaper consecutively through all the columns . The momentary amusement is derived from the illusion that the incoherent combination of words and phrases is not accidental , but is intended to make sense . The ludicrous in all its varieties will be found to involve a mental transition which exhibits an unexpected coincidence between incongruous objects or ideas . The pleasure of parody arises from the discovery of a contrast between form and substance ; that of anticlimax from the surprise due to the contrast between great expectations and small results , between promise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproportion between the idea and the expression of the idea , and frequently involves a union of incommensurable magnitudes . Of this kind is much American humor , as , " The tree was so high that it took two men and a boy to see to the top of it . " A pun is the discovery of similarity of sound under diversity of sense . It is a sort of practical joke played upon the mind , but the victim or patient ( if we may so call him who is made to laugh ) experiences an altogether painless pleasure , whereas in the practical joke the spectator only , and not the victim , enjoys the situation . A " bull " is the result of an attempt to hold two mutually exclusive ideas , two unreconciled contradictions , in the mind at the same moment . It results from a mental agility , which passes so rapidly from one point of view to another as to leave out the intervening links of thought . The only reason that Irishmen perpetrate more bulls than Englishmen or Scotchmen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you married ? " " I am not . " " Then a mighty good thing for your wife . " Or , " Is n't it better to be a coward for five minutes than a corpse the rest of one 's life ? " Or , " Died of the visitation of God under suspicious circumstances . " Or again , " If he had lived till next Tuesday he 'd have been dead three weeks . " Of the same kind is Lamb 's reply when an article was returned to him as not being suited to the taste of the present day : " D the present day ; I 'll write for antiquity . " Man is a logical animal . In his serious moods he likes to discover order in the world outside , and to exhibit order in his own thoughts . But in his playful moments he delights in inconsequence , in the interrupted order of thought or of // events ; yet he still pays this tribute to reason , and his sport so far resembles his more serious activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unconnected ideas are so arranged as to suggest rational coherence . Nonsense must wear an air of sense . If that condition is satisfied , the nonsense may be got up in artistic dress , and a fine art of nonsense is created . The broken order of the universe , with its connections still seemingly maintained , creates a passing and pleasurable surprise . Inconsequence , real or apparent , as a source of the ludicrous , may be seen in its simplest and least artistic form in the naivetd of a rustic . A Sussex peasant , for instance , thus described the peculiarities of his clock : " No one understands that here clock but me . When the hands point to twelve it strikes two , and then I know that it 's seven o'clock . " The peasant doubtless reasoned correctly about the ways of his clock , though the form of his statement sounds illogical . An answer of Lamb 's , on the other hand , which he records in his Letters , is delightful in its real inconsequence : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage-coach that is called a well - informed man . For twenty miles we discoursed about the properties of steam , probabilities of carriage by ditto , till all my science and more than all was exhausted , and I was thinking of escaping my torment by getting up on the outside , when , getting into Bishop 's Stortford , my gentleman , spying some farming land , put an unlucky question to me . What sort of a crop of turnips do you think we shall have this year I ' Emma 's eyes turned to me to know what in the world I could have to say , and she burst into a violent fit of laughter , maugre her pale , serious cheeks , when , with the greatest gravity , I replied that It depends , I believe , upon boiled legs of mutton . " ' Still deeper is the humor of Sterne . " It is not without reason , Brother Toby , that learned men write dialogues on long noses . " There is not only here the contrast between premises and conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see presently , is a mark of the highest humor . It is curious to note how the various modes in which the humorist playfully presents life have their close analogies to the forms of thought under which the mind of the lunatic involuntarily works . We may trace the resemblance from the lowest kinds of humor upward , e. g. , from the " bull , " whose frequent equivalent among madmen is some such contradiction or illusion as that which endows a man at once with the different personalities of Julius Ciesar , the Prince of Wales , and the Apostle Paul , or , by annihilating the accident of time , makes him the contemporary of all the human beings who ever lived . Whether the madman in turn finds his ludicrous in the prosaic realities and orderly sequences of the outer world , as they have stamped themselves on his memory , I do not know . But , at any rate , such reasoning as is described above , while it is the logic of bedlam , is the sport of sane men . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version at once of the ordinary sequence of events and of the relative magnitudes of things may be quoted a passage from De Quincey 's well-known paper on " Murder . " ( Vol . IV. , p. 45 . ) " If once a man indulges himself in murder , very soon he comes to think little of robbing ; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking ; and from that to incivility and procrastination . Once begin upon this downward path , you never know where you are to stop . Many a man has dated his ruin from some murder or other of which he thought little at the time . " Often it happens that it is only by knowing the thought of another that an incident becomes truly comic . Irony is a conspicuous instance in point . It properly consists in saying something less than you mean , and it produces its effect only on those who know the hidden meaning and intention which underlie the words . That effect may , according to circumstances be either comic , or tragic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene on Mount Carmel between Elijah and the prophets of Baal- " Cry aloud , for he is a god , etc . " In comedy irony is one of the most familiar modes in which humor exhibits itself . As a typical situation , one may take a case in which the spectator has been admitted into the secret of a play . The character on the stage is ignorant of this secret , and uses expressions which to the audience , who interpret them in the light of the facts , have a meaning entirely different from that // which they have to the speaker . The amusement arises from the discovery of this very discrepancy  --  the contrast between fancied knowledge and real ignorance-and the pleasure is heightened if the dupe of the piece imagines himself to be the one knowing man in it . Ironical humor is greatly indebted to the lie circumstantial . The result is a mixture of plausibility and absurdity , a series of transitions from the possible to the impossible , a combination of serious air with trivial hitention . Irony ranks under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion which is distinct from the pure ludicrous . We have seen that in all cases the ludicrous involves the discovery of a congruity in a seeming incongruity , or vice versa . We can now distinguish between wit and humor . Wit is an unexpected combination of unlike ideas in such a way as to bring out a certain similarity between them . Humor is an unexpected corn bination of like ideas in such a way as to bring out a certain dissimilarity between them . In both cases there is a transition of thought ; there is a perception of likeness and a perception of unlikeness . But in wit the dominant impression is that of likeness ; in humor , of unlikeness . " Dogmatism is puppyism full grown , " is a brilliant instance of wit and humor combined . Wit has been sometimes described as a faculty of seeing resemblances ; but the man of science and the poet , each in his own way , see resemblances or analogies , and are not , therefore , said to possess wit . Wit involves a transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that transition must be rapid . Wit is and always remains an intellectual surprise . Humor , too , in its rudimentary forms , involves such a surprise . Here , too , we have the sudden transition from one idea to another ; from the like to the unlike . But humor undergoes changes which almost transform its original character . We can hardly recognize the primitive humor , say , of the practical joke , in the delicate and evanescent quality which distinguishes the writings of the great modern humorists . We speak of a " flash of wit** and of " a vein of humor . " Wit coruscates ; humor glows . Wit is an intellectual faculty ; humor is based upon temperament and feeling . Wit generally plays upon the surface and establishes fanciful connections ; humor strikes deeper and seeks out real discrepancies . Wit must be consciously present in the mind of the speaker ; humor may reside only in the thought of the hearer . Some would limit the term humor to its higher kind , as here described ; and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet the process by which primitive humor is deepened and enlarged may be traced , and its essential identity seen under successive modifications . First , the abruptness of the mental transition is toned down . Instead of glaring contrast we have subdued lights and shades . We pass quietly from one mood to the other . There is no longer a single vigorous shock of surprise , a sudden glow , and then a burst of laughter , but an imperceptible blending of ideas , a sort of tickling of the soul . We do not at first suspect that there is anything to laugh at . At last the absurdity overcomes us , and though we do not break into an audible laugh , a ripple of merriment passes over the surface of the mind . So it comes about that humor , unlike wit , is not a single mood , but includes a series of shifting moods . It is a diffused atmosphere ; it is not here or there . We can not place our finger on it . It eludes us ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole mind and mode of thought . Personal peculiarities and temperament determine it . It is multiform and yet individual . The next stage is reached when sympathy fully enters as an ingredient into humor , which is thus indefinitely extended both in depth and range . The growing social instinct is hurt by the egoistic glory of malicious humor . The instinct of the ludicrous , finding itself in collision with the sympathetic instinct , seeks out new kinds of contrast , other forms of incongruity , in which it may indulge itself apart from the spectacle of another 's abasement . Sympathy and humor are thus led to form an alliance  --  the fact which , of all others , is of most far-reaching consequence in the evolution of the ludicrous . Sympathy deepens insight , and sympathetic humor directs its observation to the more serious realities of life . The sense of the incongruous in life has in most men been effaced by familiarity . Humor , enriched and informed by sympathy , looks below the surface of things ; it rediscovers the inner incongruities and deeper discords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It finds material everywhere both for laughter and for tears , and pathos henceforth becomes the companion of humor . Sensibility takes the place of malice , affection of contempt . The eye of the humorist recognizes his own affinity with the humanity which provokes him to mirth . He does not , like the satirist , stand apart from men in fancied superiority . He laughs at them , but with them he laughs also at himself . We said above that humor in its lighter mood playfully concocts obvious fallacies , which the sane man for the moment accepts as serious , placing himself in the mental attitude of one deranged . But humor in its more serious activity penetrates to the secret inconsequences which underlie action , to the undetected fallacies , the contradictions between premises and conclusions , between means and ends , which pass unnoticed , the inverted logic which is the law of human life . The ordinary comic writer laughs at individual men . Or else he isolates and exaggerates certain traits of character , and so constructs types of particular follies . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misanthrope , the pedant , the poltroon , and invites to the show grave and sane and respectable people , men and women who look on from outside , and laugh complacently at that in which they have no part or lot , and give thanks inwardly that they are not even as those others . The deeper humorist has less respect for his audience , and less contempt for the characters he puts upon the stage . The world for him is not divided into fools and sages . It is one in which all are fools , each after his kind . The doctor who tends the madman is himself touched by some disorder , and may well bear with the eccentricities of his patient . To the humorist there is no such thing as individual folly , but only folly universal in a world of fools . Humor annihilates the finite . As Coleridge says , " The little is made great and the great little , in order to destroy both because all is equal in contrast with the infinite . " Uncle Toby , in Tristram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epitome of the follies of the race . The philosophy of Tristram Shandy may be summed up in this-the infinitesimally small governs the world . This was a branch of psychological inquiry which Sterne made his own . The great effects produced by insignificant VOL . LXXX. - No. 480-85 causes he worked up into what might be called a moral molecular theory . The atom of the moral world is the hobbyhorse . Always and in all men it is somewhere to be found , at the back of the wisest brain - an infantile survival . It lasts into old age . It is not only the ruling passion , but , if we may so say , the ruling faculty in man . It inspires the imagination , and the imagination moVes the reason . Reason is the nominal sovereign , but the reality of power rests with the hobby-horse . This universalizing gift of humor , which meets us occasionally , but very rarely , in ancient literature , as in The Birds of Aristophanes , attains its highest perfection in Don Quixote . Don Quixote in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books of chivalry , but as the story develops we find that it is the veracious history of a would-be knight , to whom every inn is a castle , who tilts at windmills and fancies he is fighting giants , whose imagination dwells in a world of oppressed duennas , while the mean reality that corresponds to that dream is Dulcinea del Toboso . Don Quixote has in him the soul of a hero , and wants only sanity to make him one . But he is no ordinary madman ; his delicacy and nobility of feeling inspire us with both pity and affection . He speaks the very langu*e of poetry . His mind works lucidly when it is diverted from his monomania . He can give excellent advice on the government of states . Through his character there runs a pathetic contradiction ; his acts and his aspirations are in ceaseless disagreement . He aims at the sublime and falls into the ridiculous , and yet he never forfeits our respect . Over against him Sancho is set as a foil , the prosaic nature who attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too is a complex being ; selfish and yet devoted , simple and yet subtle , believing everything and doubting everything , full of shrewd common-sense and of extravagant credulity . Man and master are each a tissue of contradictions , yet each a living personality . Each character presents a contrast with itself and an equal contrast with the other . Taking the book in all its relations , it is a summary of the contradictions of human life , of the disproportion between the idea and the fact , between soul and body , between the brilliant daydreams and the waking reality . We re // call the saying of Socrates in the Symposium that the genius of tragedy and of comedy is the same ; and elsewhere Plato with profound insight speaks of i-il rot ' /3iov 4vpwitcrp rpay*iq Ka* * " the whole tragicomedy of life . " ( Philebus , p. 50 . ) Humor is the meetingpoint of tragedy and comedy . The humorist sees the irony of destiny ; he sees around him shattered ideals ; he is aware of discords and imperfections ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddened and amused in turn . Not that the toleration with which the humorist contemplates the sight of human imperfection implies , as is sometimes said , an enfeebled moral sense . He is not half-hearted as a moralist ; rather , he is not strictly a moralist at all . For the time being the moral sense is kept in abeyance , or is but feebly aroused . Comedy considers life from another aspect than tragedy . How , it may be asked , can we laugh at a selfish old sensualist like Falstaff ? Simply because comedy isolates its field of vision ; it regards the world under certain limited relations . Sin as sin it does not bring into its horizon . Sin it apprehends not as having its source in a depraved will , but rather in its intellectual aspect as want of self-knowledge , or fol ly . This folly , manifesting itself in action , with all its unconscious absurdities , is the subject-matter with which humor deals . Humor is not , indeed , incompatible with strong moral convictions . Cynicism is sceptical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a striking fact that seriousness and humor constantly go together . The most serious nations in Europe have , on the whole , been the most humorous . In literature England and Spain stand out pre-eminent . Scotchmen are humorous ; not perhaps witty , for mere intellectual rapidity does not appear to be one of their marked characteristics . They are a serious race . Their thought is tinged with theology . They have been conversant from childhood with the deepest problems of existence . The two worlds of the flesh and the spirit stand for them very near together , and they pass rapidly from one to the other . The contrasts and dissonances of life stand out more apparent to eyes which have " been used to look on man 's mortality . " When the moral tension is for the time relaxed , the mind makes itself merry precisely with these contrasts . The faculty which can at will invert the relative values of all things in the universe , which can annihilate the great and small , rests on a belief in something transcending small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivial incident or person into one of infinite significance . Humor implies belief , not scepticism . We can therefore understand how , in the ages of faith , religion has been itself very lenient to pious worshippers , and has not resented what believers do in sport . In medimnval Europe Catholicism tolerated a startling burlesque of religion , and found its choicest material for humor in the person of the devil . The Greeks , not having a devil , had to spend their humor on their gods , and in doing so did not derogate from their dignity . Such sportive irreverence was very different from in fidelity . Had Aristophanes been a sceptic , he could not have dared to trifle with the gods as lie did . In short , those only can laugh heartily who believe sincerely in something . The play of humor needs a serious background . Hum*r lives upon conviction . Let us now gather up the threads of this discourse , and mark the direction in which our argument seems to point . First we will compare our results with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that malignant pleasure is the original and determining element in the ludicrous . Next , that so deeply seated in our nature is the disinterested delight in others ' misfortune that malignancy always continues to constitute the essence of the ludicrous , and may be detected by analysis under whatever disguises and refinements , and however much tempered by the action of sympafhy . Now if we assume for the moment that the ludicrous was in its origin inseparable from malignant and triumphant laughter , and if we admit , what is beyond dispute , that malice , either playful or contemptuous , forms no small part of the recorded humor of the world , yet surely it is only by a forced interpretation of psychological facts that we can find this primitive malignity in every variety of civilized hiumor . If our foregoing analysis is at all correct , there are many modes and forms of laughter in which no surviving malignity , contempt , or superiority can now be traced . It is , however , characteristic of a certain school of philosophers of the present day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to // their origin ; to interpret them as they are now , and in their essence , by what they were in their bare rudiments and beginnings . It can not be too often repeated that the psychological history of a sentiment , emotion , or faculty is distinct from the philosophic account of its essence and character ; that the flower is not explained by the germ ; that the actual , the developed , the realized perfection is not explained by the undeveloped , the inchoate , the latent possibility . Others ( e. g. , H. D. Traill , National Review , February , 1888 ) give up the attempt to reduce the ludicrous in all its developed forms to the malignant type . They maintain the same theory as Mr. Bain with regard to its origin , but hold that in some at least of its manifestations it has divested itself of the original ingredient of malice under the influence of sympathy , and that what was once an antisocial and antipathetic emotion has been transmuted into one of an opposite character . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , as is pretty certain , savages and primitive people everywhere to - day laugh at absurdities untinged by malice , and altogether apart from any triumphant superiority , we may reasonably infer that in early man also there was a sense of the ludicrous which was awakened by the perception of pure incongruity . We are thus led up to the view that the ludicrous is not in its essence antipathetic any more than it is sympathetic , but that it allies itself at one time with malice , at another time with sympathy , and sometimes again is detached from both . If we disentangle these emotions , we perceive that it is the shock of surprise at a painless incongruity that produces the pleasure of the pure ludicrous . The last stage in the upward ascent of the ludicrous is reached when it is associated with sympathy . Hereby it gains extension over a fresh area ; it is , moreover , deepirned and sweetened , and becomes a saving faculty to the race of toiling mortals . The sense of humor preserves sensibility from degenerating into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps a man to maintain his balance and sanity of mind in the cornplications of life . Many are the uses of civilized humor under our social conditions of to-day . But we are still confronted with difficulty when we go back to the question asked at the outset , How did the ludicrous minister to the primitive necessities of man ? We have already seen what explanation the evolutionists can give of the utilitarian value of malicious humor . But if our conclusions are correct , this is but one kind of humor . How are we , on strict Darwinian principles , to account for the development of that kind of humor which is unmixed with malice ? It is hardly satisfactory to say that the faculty of seeing the ludicrous in things adds to the joy of the community , heightens its vitality by releasing a surplus fund of energy , and so indirectly increases the active powers of that tribe or people which has cultivated it , and the chances of their success in the struggle for existence . That might be true as applied to ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure ludicrous entered , indeed , but entered rarely and as a slight ingredient into his anxious existence . There must have been far too little scope and occasion for it to admit of its adding appreciably to vital energy . In short , evolutionary theory , in the form in which it is commonly set forth by its scientific exponents , that is , as a mechanical , not a teleological system , fails to account for the origin of non-malicious humor . It can not point to any precise end served in its undeveloped forms . Recent morphological inquiry has a curious bearing on this point . Biologists have lately been busy discussing the meaning of a certain organ , to which in the present stage of its development it appears impossible to assign any utilitarian value . The case I allude to is the electric organ in the tail of the skate , on which Professor Cossar Ewart read a paper before the Royal Society ( Phil . Trans. , Vol . LXXIX . ) . Other aquatic animals which possess such organs use them to advantage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the skate , though a most complicated mechanism , a structure as elaborate as any in the animal kingdom , appears to be of no benefit whatever to its possessor . The electricity which it is capable of generating and discharging is so slight that it can not be felt by the human hand , and is only audible in the telephone . This imperceptible shock can scarcely be conceived as serving any purpose of defence . Various convincing reasons are brought to prove that the organ is not in process of degeneration , but in process of // evolution . If , then , this complex and highly specialized mechanism still remains without a functional use , all the greater is the difficulty of conceiving how it can have aided the survival of the fittest in the earliest stages of its growth . It points , it would seem , to something beyond itself from which it derives its meaning ; it appears to be prophetic of the future . If this result should be scientifically established , it would lead to a profound modification of the current theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a use , or it could not have come into being , science has to say that everything must have had at least a prospective use , the whole philosophy of evolution will be altered . Now , evolution has , as it fancies , satisfactorily ac counted for the growth and development of most of the faculties of the humanmind . But it has not been able to explain the sense of the ludicrous , except on the disproved assumption that it is in all cases malignant in origin . On this subject the evolutionists may still have something more to say . Meanwhile , looking to the mental facts as we find them , and accepting as a provisional hypothesis the scientific conclusions above referred to , we may suggest that the perception of the pure ludicrous or non-malicious humor , in primitive man resembles the action of the immature electric organ , which is as yet of no practical utility to its possessor , but whose meaning and value are prospective , and which will some day justify its own existence .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
