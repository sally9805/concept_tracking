THE SECRET OF THE WILD ROSE PATH . " Shall I callithee Bird , Or but a wandering Voice ? ** WORDSWORTH 'S lines are addressed to the cuckoo of the Old World , a bird of unenviable reputation , notorious for imposing his most sacred duties upon others ; naturally , therefore , one who would not court observation , and whose ways would be somewhat mysterious . But the American repre*entative of the family is a bird of different manners . Unlike his namesake across the water , our cuckoo never - or so rarely as practically to be never - shirks the labor of // nest-building and raising a family . He has no reason to skulk , and though always a shy bird , he is no more so than several others , and in no sense is he a mystery . There is , however , one American bird for whom Wordsworth 's verse might have been written ; one whose chief aim seems to be , reversing our grandmothers ' rule for little people , to be heard , and not seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a misfortune , an accident , which he avoids with great care , while his voice rings out loud and clear above all others in the shrubbery . I refer to the yellow-breasted chat ( Icteria virens ) , whose summer home is the warmer temperate regions of our country , from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast , and whose unbirdlike utterances prepare one to believe the stories told of his eccentric actions ; this , for example , by Dr. Abbott : " Aloft in the sunny air he springs ; To his timid mate he calls ; With dangling legs and fluttering wings On the tangled smilax falls ; He mutters , he shrieks - A hopeless cry ; You think that he seeks In peace to die , But pity him not ; t is the ghostly chat , An imp if there is one , be sure of that . " I first knew the chat-if one may be said to know a creature so shy - in a pleasant corner of Colorado , a small , deserted park at the foot of Cheyenne Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( one can hardly call them songs ) ; I secured one or two fleeting glimpses of his graceful form ; I sought and discovered the nest , which thereupon my Lady Chat promptly abandoned , though I had not laid a finger upon it ; and last of all , I had the sorrow and shame of knowing that my curiosity had driven the pair from the neighborhood . This was the Western form of Icteria , differing from the Eastern only in a greater length of tail , which several of our Rocky Mountain birds affect , for Wild Rose Path . April , the purpose , apparently , of puzzling the ornithologist . Two years after my unsuccessful attempt to cultivate friendly relations with the " ghostly chat , " the middle of May found me on the shore of the Great Salt Lake , where I settled myself at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains , at that point bare , gray , and unattractive , showing miles of loose boulders and great patches of sagebush . In the monotonous stretches of this shrub , each plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy birds , as well hidden as bobolinks in the meadow grass , or meadow larks in the alfalfa . But on this mountain side no friendly cover existed from which I could spy out bird secrets . Whatever my position and wherever I placed myself , I was as conspicuous as a tower in the middle of a plain ; again , no shadow of protection was there from the too ardent sun of Utah , which drew the vitality from my frame as it did the color from my gown ; worse than these , the everywhere present rocks were the chosen haunts of the one enemy of a peaceful bird lover , the rattlesnake , and I hesitated to pursue the bird because I invariably forgot to watch and listen for the reptile . Bird study under these conditions was impossible , but the place presented a phase of nature unfamiliar to me , and for a time so fascinating that every morning my steps turned of themselves " up the stony pathway to the hills . " The companion of my walks , a fellow bird student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The odorous bush had associations for her ; she reveled in it ; she inhaled its fragrance as a delicious perfume ; she filled her pockets with it ; . she lay for hours at a time on the ground , where she could bask in the sunshine , and see nothing but the gray leaves around her and the blue sky above . I can hardly tell what was the fascination for me . It was certainly not the // view of the mountains , though mountains are beyond words in my affections . The truth is , the Rocky Mountains , many of them , need a certain distance to make them either picturesque or dignified . The range then daily before our eyes , the Wasatch , was , to dwellers at its feet , bleak , monotonous , and hopelessly prosaic . The lowest foothills , being near , hid the taller peaks , as a penny before the eye will hide a whole landscape . Let me not , however , be unjust to the mountains I love . There is a range which satisfies my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful picture , or rather a whole gallery of pictures . I can shut my eyes and see it at this moment , as I have seen it a thousand times . In the early morning , when the level sun shines on its face , it is like one continuous mountain reaching across the whole western horizon ; it has a broken and beautiful sky line ; Pike 's Peak looms up toward the middle , and lovely Cheyenne ends it in graceful slope on the south ; lights and shadows play over it ; its colors change with the changing sky or atmosphere , - sometimes blue as the heavens , sometimes misty as a dream ; it is wonderfully beautiful then . But wait till the sun gets higher ; look again at noon , or a little later . Behold the whole range has sprung into life , separated into individuals : gorges are cut where none had appeared ; chasms come to light ; cafions and all sorts of divisijns are seen ; foothills move forward to their proper places , and taller peaks turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one never suspected come out in the picture : the transformation is marvelous . But the sun moves on , the magical moment passes , each mountain slips back into line , and behold , you see again the morning 's picture . Indulge me one moment , while I try to show you the last picture impressed upon my memory , as the train bore me , unwilling , away . It was cloudy , a storm 489 was coming up , and the whole range was in deep shadow , when suddenly through some rift in the clouds a burst of sunshine fell upon the " beloved mountain " Cheyenne , and upon it alone . In a moment it was a smiling picture , " glad With light as with a garment it was clad ; " all its inequalities , its divisions , its irregularities emphasized , its greens turned greener , its reds made more glowing , - an unequaled gem for a parting gift . To come back to Utah . One morning , on our way up to the heights , as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang out . The voice was loud and clear , and the notes were of a peculiar character : first a " chack " two or three times repeated , then subdued barks like those of a distressed puppy , followed by hoarse " mews " and other sounds suggesting almost any creature rather than one in feathers . But with delight I recognized the chat ; my enthusiasm instantly revived . I unfolded my camp chair , placed myself against a stone wall on the opposite side of the road , and became silent and motionless as the wall itself . My comrade , on the contrary , as was her custom , proceeded with equal promptness to follow the bird up , to hunt him out . She slipped between the barbed wires which , quite unnecessarily , one would suppose , defended the bleak pasture from outside encroachment , and passed out of sight down an obscure path that led into the brush where the bird was hidden . Though our ways differ , or rather , perhaps , because our ways differ , we are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumventing the wily chat , and that happened which had happened before : in fleeing from one who made herself obvious to him , he presented himself , an unsuspecting victim , to another who sat like a statue against the wall . To avoid his pursuer , the bird slipped through the thick foliage of the low The Secret of the Wild Rose Path . // oaks , and took his place on the outside , in full view of me , but looking through the branches at the movements within so intently that he never turned his eyes toward me . This gave me an opportunity to study his manners that is rare indeed , for a chat off his guard is something inconceivable . He shouted out his whole r*pertoire ( or so it seemed ) with great vehemence , now " peeping " like a bird in the nest , then " chacking " like a blackbird , mewing as neatly as pussy herself , and varying these calls by the rattling of castanets and other indescribable sounds . His perch was halfway down the bush ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spring glory , and he stood nearly upright as he sang , every moment stretching up to look for the invader behind the leaves . The instant she appeared outside , he vanished within , and I folded my chair and passed on . His disturber had not caught a glimpse of him . My next interview with a chat took place a day or two later . Between the cottage which was our temporary home and the next one was a narrow garden bordered by thick hedges , raspberry bushes down each side , and a mass of flowering shrubs next the street . From my seat within the house , a little back from the open window , I was startled by the voice of a chat close at hand . Looking cautiously out , I saw him in the garden , foraging about under cover of the bushes , near the ground , and there for some time I watched him . He had not the slightest repose of manner ; the most ill-bred tramp in the English sparrow family was in that respect his superior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdo him in posturing , jerking himself up , flirting his tail , and hopping from twig to twig . When musically inclined , he perched on the inner side of the bushes against the front fence , a foot or two above the ground , and within three feet of any one who might pass , but perfectly hidden from them . The performance of the chat was exceedingly droll : first a whistle , clear as an oriole note , followed by chacks that would deceive a redwing himself , and then , oddest of all , the laugh of a feeble old man , a weak sort of " yah ! yah ! yah ! " If I had not seen him in the act , I could not have believed the sound came from a bird 's throat . He concluded with a low , almost whispered " chur-r-r , " a sort of private chuckle over his unique exhibition . After a few minutes ' singing he returned to his foraging on the ground , or over the lowest twigs of the bushes , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head thrown up , and his beautiful golden throat swelling with the happy song . The listener and looker behind the screen was charmed to absolute quiet , and the bird so utterly unsuspicious of observers that he was perfectly natural and at his ease , hopping quickly from place to place , and apparently snatching his repast between notes . The chat 's secret of invisibility was thus plainly revealed . It is not in his protective coloring , for though his back is modest of hue , his breast is conspicuously showy ; nor is it in his size , for he is ahuost as large as an oriole ; it is in his manners . The bird I was watching never approached the top of a shrub , but invariably perched a foot or more below it , and his movements , though quick , were silence itself . No rustle of leaves proclaimed his presence ; indeed , he seemed to avoid leaves , using the outside twigs near the main stalk or trunk , where they are usually quite bare , and no flit of wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a seemingly natural wariness and cautiousness in every movement and attitude that I never saw equaled in feathers . Then , too , the clever fellow was so constantly on his guard and so alert that the least stir attracted his attention . // Though inside the house , as I said , not near the window , and further veiled by screens , I had to remain as nearly motionless as possible , and use my glass with utmost caution . The smallest movement sent him into the hushes like a shot , - or rather , like a shadow , for the passage was always noiseless . Suspicion once aroused , the bird simply disappeared . One could not say of him , as of others , that he flew , for whether he used his wings , or melted away , or sank into the earth , it would be hard to tell . All I can be positive about is , that whereas one moment he was there , the next he was gone . After this exhibition of the character of the chat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery , it may appear strange that I should try again to study him at home , to find his nest and see his family . But there is something so bewitching in his individuality that , though I may be alwm*ys baffled , I shall never be discouraged . Somewhat later , when it was evident that his spouse had arrived and domestic life had begun , and I became accustomed to hearing a chat in a certain place every day as I passed , I resolved to make one more effort to win his confidence , or , if not that , at least his tolerance . The chat medley for which I was always listening came invariably from one spot on my pathway up the mountain . It was the lower end of a large horse pasture , and near the entrance stood a small brick house , in which no doubt dwelt the owner , or care-taker , of the animals . The wide gate , in a common fashion of that country , opened in the middle , and was fastened by a link of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the iron as I touched it , on the morning I resolved to go in , brought to the door a woman . She was rather young , with hair cut close to her head , and wore a dark cotton gown , which was short and scant of skirt , and covered with a " checked apron . " She was evi Wild Rose Path . 491 dently at work , and was probably the mistress , since few in that " working bee " village kept maids . I made my request to go into the pasture to look at the birds . " Why , certainly , " she said , with a courtesy that I have found everywhere in Utah , though with a slow surprise growing in her face . " Come right in . " I closed and fastened the gate , and started on past her . Three feet beyond the doorsteps I was brought to a standstill : the ground as far as I could see was water-soaked ; it was like a saturated sponge . Utah is dominated by Irrigation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going there from the land of rains has much to learn of the possibilities and the inconveniences of water . I was always stumbling upon it in new combinations and unaccustomed places , and I never could get used to its vagaries . Books written in the interest of the Territory indulge in rhapsodies over the fact that every man is his own rain-maker ; and I admit that the arrangement has its advantages - to the cultivator . But judging froni the standpoint of an outsider , I should say that man is not an improvement upon the original providence which distributes the staff of life to plants elsewhere , spreading the vital fluid over the whole land so evenly that every grass blade gets its due share ; and as all parts are wet at once , so all are dry at the same time , and the surplus , if there be any , runs in well-appointed ways , with delight to both eye and ear . All this is changed when the office of Jupiter Pluvius devolves upon man ; different indeed are his methods . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it wanders whither it will over the ground . The grass hides it , and the walker , bird student or botanist , steps splash into it without the slightest warning . This is always unpleasant , and is sometimes disastrous , as when one at . tempts to cross the edge of a field of some close-growing crop , and instantly // sinks to the top of the shoes in the soft mud . On the morning spoken of , I stopped before the barrier , considering how I should pass it , when the woman showed me a narrow passage between the house and the stone wall , through which I could reach the higher ground at the back . I took this path , and in a moment was in the grove of young oaks which made her out-of-doors kitchen and yard . A fire was burning merrily in the stove , which stood under a tree ; frying-pans and baking-tins , dippers and dish-cloths , hung on the outer wall of her little house , and the whole had a camping-out air that was captivating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed to linger and study this open-air housekeeping ; if that woman had only been a bird ! But I passed on through the oak-grove back yard , following a path the horses had made , till I reached an open place where I could overlook the lower land , filled with clumps of willows with their feet in the water , and rosebushes " O'erburdened with their weight of flowers , And drooping neath their own sweet scent . " A bird was singing as I took my seat , a grosbeak , - perhaps the one who had entertained me in the field below , while I had waited hour after hour for his calm-eyed mate to point out her nest . He sang there from the top of a tall tree , and she busied herself in the low bushes , but up to that time they had kept their secret well . He was a beautiful bird in black and orange-brown and gold , - the black-headed grosbeak ; and his song , besides being very pleasing , was interesting because it seemed hard to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful strain , and found himself unable to execute it . But if he felt the incompleteness of his performance as I did , he did not let it put an end to his endeavor . I sat there listening , and he came nearer , even to a low tree over my head ; and as I had a glimpse or two of his mate in a tangle of willow and roses far out iu the wet land , I concluded he was singing to her , and not to me . Now that he was so near I heard more than I had before , - certain low , sweet notes , plainly not intended for the public ear . This undertone song ended always in " sweet ! sweet ! sweet ! " usually followed by a trill , and was far more effective than his state performances . Sometimes , after the " sweet " repeated half a dozen times , each note lower than the preceding one , he ended with a sort of purr of contentment . I became so absorbed in listening that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was suddenly recalled by a loud voice at one side , and the lively genius of the place was on hand in his usual role . Indeed , he rather surpassed himself in mocking and taunting cries that morning , either because he wished , as my host , to entertain me , or , what was more probakle , to reproach me for disturbing the serenity of his life . Whatever might have been his motive , he delighted me , as always , by the spirit and vigor with which he poured out his chacks and whistles and rattles and calls . Then I tried to locate him by following up the sound , picking my way through the bushes and among the straggling arms of the irrigating stream . After some experiments , I discovered that he was most concerned when I came near an impenetrable tangle that skirted the lower end of the lot . I say " near : " it was neal- " as the crow flies , " but for one without wings it may have been half a mile ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rallying point of the most erratic of wandering streamlets , and so given over to its vagaries that no bird-gazer , however enthusiastic , and indifferent to wet feet and draggled garments , dared attempt to pass . There I was forced to pause , while the bird flung out his notes as if in defiance , wilder , louder , and more vehement than ever . In that thicket , I said to myself , as I // took my way home , behind that tangle , if I can manage to reach it , I shall find the home of the chat . The situation was discouraging , but I was not to be discouraged ; to reach that stronghold I was resolved , if I had to dam up the irrigator , build a bridge , or fill up the quagmire . No such heroic treatment of the difficulty was demanded ; my problem was very simply solved . As I entered the gate the next morning , my eyes fell upon an obscure footpath leading away from the house and the watery way beyond it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle in which the chat had hidden . It looked mysterious , not to say forbidding , and from the low drooping of the foliage above it was plainly a horse path , not a human way . But it was undoubtedly the key to the secrets of the tangle , and I turned into it without hesitation . Stooping under the branches hanging low with their fragrant burden , and stopping every moment to loosen the hold of some hindering thorn , I followed in the footsteps of my four-footed pioneers , till I reached the lower end of the marsh that had kept me from entering on the upper side . On its edge I placed my chair and seated myself . It was an ideal retreat ; within call if help were needed , yet a solitude it was plain no human being , in that land where ( according to the Prophet ) every man , woman , and child is a working bee , ever invaded ; " a leafy nook Where wind never entered , nor branch ever shook , " known only to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! iNo discoverer of a new land , no stumbler upon a gold mine , was ever more exhilarated over his find than I over my solitary wild rose path . The tangle was composed of a varied growth . There seemed to have been originally a straggling row of low trees , chokecherry , peach , and willow , which had been surrounded , overwhelmed , and almost buried by a rich growth of shoots from their own roots , bound and cemented together by the luxuriant wild rose of the West , which grows profusely everywhere it can get a foothold , stealing up around and between the branches , till it overtops and fairly smothers in blossoms a fair-sized oak or other tree . Besides these were great ferns , or brakes , three or four feet high , which filled up the edges of the thicket , making it absolutely impervious to the eye as well as to the foot of any straggler . Except in the obscure passages the horses kept open , no person could penetrate my jungle . I had hardly placed myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it became evident that my presence disturbed somebody . A chat cried out excitedly , " chack ! chack ! whe-e-w ! whereupon there followed an angry squawk , so loud and so near that it startled me . I turned quickly , and saw madam herself , all ruffled as if from the nest . She was plainly as much startled as I was , but she scorned to flee . She perked up her tail till she looked like an exaggerated wren ; she humped her shoulders ; she turned this way and that , showing in every movement her anger at my intrusion ; above all , she repeated at short intervals that squawk , like an enraged hen . Hearing a rustle of wings on the other side , I turned my eyes an instant , and when I looked again she had gone ! She would not run while I looked at her , but she had the true chat instinct of keeping out of sight . She did not desert her grove , however . The canopy over my head , the roof to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost transparent . The sun was the sun of Utah ; it cast strong shadows , and not a bird could move without my seeing it . I could see that she remained on guard , hopping and flying silently from one point of view to another , no // doubt keeping close watch of me all the time . Meanwhile the chat himself had not for a moment ceased calling . For some time his voice would sound quite near ; then it would draw off , growing more and more distant , as if he were tired of watching one who did absolutely nothing . But he never got far away before madam recalled him , sometimes by the squawk alone , sometimes preceding it by a single clear whistle , exactly in his own tone . At once , as if this were a signal , - which doubtless it was , - his cries redoubled in energy , and seemed to come nearer again . Above the restless demonstrations of the chats I could hear the clear , sweet song of the Western meadow lark in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the minstrel of the meadow knew perfectly well that his nest and nestlings were as safely hidden in the middle of the growing lucern as if in another planet ; while the chat , on the contrary , was plainly conscious of the ease with which his homestead might be discovered . A ruthless destroyer , a nest-robbing boy , would have had the whole thing in his pocket days ago . Even I , if I had not preferred to have the owners show it to me ; if I had not made excuses to myself , of the marsh , of bushes too low to go under ; if I had not hated to take it by force , to frighten the little folk I wished to make friends with , - even I might have seen the nest long before that morning . Thus I meditated as , after waiting an hour or two , I started home . Outside the gate I met my fellow-student , and we went on together . Our way lay beside an old orchard that we had often noticed in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so overgrown that they formed a deep shade , like a heavy forest , which was most attractive when everything outside was baking in the June sun . It was nearly noon when we reached the gate , and looking into a place " so curtained with trunks and boughs That in hours when the ringdove cooes to his spouse The sun to its heart scarce a way could win , " we could not resist its inviting coolness ; we went in . As soon as we were quiet , we noticed that there were more robins than we had heretofore seen in one neighborhood in that part of the world ; for our familiar bird is by no means plentiful in the Rocky Mountain countries , where grassy lawns are rare , and his chosen food is not forthcoming . The old apple-trees seemed to be a favorite nesting-place , and before we had been there five minutes we saw that there were at least two nests within fifty feet of us , and a grosbeak singing his love song so near that we had hopes of finding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alighting of a bird low down on the trunk of a tree , perhaps twenty feet away , called the attention of my friend to a neighbor we had not counted upon , a large snake , with , as we noted with horror , the color and markings of the dreaded rattler . He had , as it seemed , started to climb one of the leaning trunks , and when he had reached a point where the trunk divided into two parts , his head about two feet up , and the lower part of his body still on the ground , had stopped , and now rested thus , motionless as the tree itself . It may be that it was the sudden presence of his hereditary enemy that held him apparently spellbound , or it is possible that this position served his own purposes better than any other . Our first impulse was to leave his lordship in undisputed possession of his shady retreat ; but the second thought , which held us , was to see what sort of reception the robins would give him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , and it was the mother who had come down to interview the foe . Would she call her mate ? Would the neighbors come to the rescue ? Should we see a fight , such // as we had read of ? We decided to wait for the result . Strange to say , however , this little mother did not call for help . Not one of the loud , disturbed cries with which robins greet an innocent bird student or a passing sparrow hawk was heard from her ; though her kinsfolk sprinkled the orchard , she uttered not a sound . For a moment she seemed dazed ; she stood motionless , staring at the invader as if uncertain whether he were alive . Then she appeared to be interested ; she came a little nearer , still gazing into the face of her enemy , whose erect head and glittering eyes were turned toward her . We could not see that he made the slightest movement , while she hopped nearer and nearer ; sometimes on one division of the trunk , and sometimes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming a little nearer . She did not act frightened nor at all anxious ; she simply seemed interested , and inclined to close investigation . Was she fascinated ? Were the old stories of snake power over birds true ? Our interest was most intense ; we did not take our eyes from her ; nothing would have dragged us away then . Suddenly the bird flew to the ground , and , so quickly that we did not see the movement , the head of the snake was turned over toward her , proving that it was the bird , and not us , he was watching . Still she kept drawing nearer , till she was not more than a foot from him , when our sympathy with the unfortunate creature , who apparently was unable to tear herself away , overcame our scientific curiosity . " Poor thing , she 11 be killed ! Let us drive her away ! " we cried . We picked up small stones which we threw toward her ; we threatened her with sticks ; we " shooed " at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in possession of its senses . Not a step farther off did she move ; she hopped one side to avoid our missiles , but instantly fluttered back to her doom . Meanwhile her mate appeared upon the scene , hovering anxiously about in the trees overhead , but not coming near the snake . By this time we had lost all interest in the question whether a snake can charm a bird to its destruction ; we thought only of saving the little life in such danger . We looked around for help ; my friend ran across the street to a house , hurriedly secured the help of a man with a heavy stick , and in two minutes the snake lay dead on the ground . The bird , at once relieved , flew hastily to her nest , showing no signs of mental aberration , or any other effect of the strain she had been under . The snake was what the man called a " bull snake , " and so closely resembled the rattler in color and markings that , although its exterminator had killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , until it was stretched out in death , which of the two it was . This tragedy spoiled the old orchard for me , and never again did I enter its gates . Down the wild rose path I took my way the next morning . Silently and quickly I gained my seat of yesterday , hoping to surprise the chat family . No doubt my hope was vain ; noiseless , indeed , and deft of movement must be the human being who could come upon this alert bird unawares . He greeted me with a new note , a single clear call , like " ho ! " Then he proceeded to study me , coming cautiously nearer and nearer , as I could see out of the corner of my eye , while pretending to be closely occupied with my notebook . His loud notes had ceased , but it is not in chat nature to be utterly silent ; many low sounds dropped from his beak as he approached . Sometimes it was a squawk , a gentle imitation of that which rang through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hoarse sort of mewing , followed by various indescribable sounds in the same undertone ; and then he would suddenly take himself in hand , and be perfectly silent for half a minute . // After a little , madam took up the matter , uttering her angry squawk , and breaking upon my silence almost like a pistol shot . At once I forgot her mate , and though he retired to a little distance and resumed his brilliant musical performance , I did not turn my head at his beguilements . She was the business partner of the firm whose movements I wished to follow . She must , sooner or later , go to her nest , while he might deceive me for days . Indeed , I strongly suspected him of that very thing , and whenever he became bolder in approaching , or louder and more vociferous of tongue , I was convinced that it was to cover her operations . I redoubled my vigilance in watching for her , keeping my eyes open for any slight stirring of a twig , tremble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should point her out as she skulked to her nest . I had already observed that whenever she uttered her squawks he instantly burst into energetic shouts and calls . I believed it a concerted action , with the intent of drawing my attention from her movements . On this day , the disturbed little mother herself interviewed me . First she came silently under the green canopy , in plain sight , stood a moment before me , jerking up her beautiful long tail and letting it drop slowly back , and posing her mobile body in different positions ; then suddenly flying close past me , she alighted on one side , and stared at me for half a dozen seconds . Then , evidently , she resolved to take me in hand . She assumed the rOle of deceiver , with all the wariness of her family ; her object being , as I suppose , carefully to point out where her nest was not . She circled about me , taking no pains to avoid my gaze . Now she squawked on the right ; then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time it was from the clump of rosebushes in front that she rose hurriedly , as if that was her home ; again it was from over my head , in the chokecherry-tree , that she bustled off , as if she had been " caught in the act . " It was a brilliant , a wonderful performance , a thousand times more effective than trailing or any of the similar devices by which an uneasy bird mother draws attention from her brood . It was so well done that at each separate manwuvre I could hardly be convinced by my own eyes that the particular spot indicated did not conceal the little homestead I was seeking . Several times I rose triumphant , feeling sure that " now indeed I do know where it is , " and proceeded at once to the bush she had pointed out with so much simulated reluctance , parted the branches , and looked in , only to find myself deceived again . Her acting was marvelous . With just the properly anxious , uneasy manner , she would steal behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chat 's nest , and after a moment sneak out at the other side , and fly away near the ground , exactly as all bird students have seen bird mothers do a thousand times . After this performance a silence fell upon the tangle and the solitary nook in which I sat , - and I meditated . It was the last day of my stay . Should I set up a search for that nest which I was sure was within reach ? I could go over the whole in half an hour , examine every shrub and low tree and inch of ground in it , and doubtless I should find it . No ; I do not care for a nest thus forced . The distress of parents , the panic of nestlings , give me no pleasure . I know how a chat 's nest looks . I have seen one with its pinky-pearl eggs ; why should I care to see another ? I know how young birds look ; I have seen dozens of them this very summer . Far better that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such cost . As I reached this conclusion , into the midst of my silence came the steady tramp of a horse . I knew the wild rose path was a favorite retreat from the sun , // and it was then very hot . The path was narrow ; if a horse came in upon me , he could not turn around and retreat , nor was there room for him to pass me . Realizing all this in an instant , I snatched up my belongings , and hurried to get out before he should get in . When I emerged , the chat set up his loudest and most triumphant shouts . " Again we have fooled you , " he seemed to say ; " again we have thrown your poor human acuteness off the scent ! We shall manage to bring up our babies in safety , in spite of you ! " So indeed they might , even if I had seen them ; but this , alas , I could not make him understand . So he treated me - his best friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird shooter . I shall never know whether that nest contained eggs or young birds , or whether perchance there was no nest at all , and I had been deceived from the first by the most artful and beguiling of birds .
