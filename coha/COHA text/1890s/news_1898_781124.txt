The successful accomplishment of the campaign against Santiago , resulting in its downfall and the surrender of the Spanish forces and the capture of large amounts of military stores , together with the destruction of the entire Spanish fleet in the harbor , which , upon the investment of the city , was forced to leave , is one of which this army can well be proud . This has been accomplished through the heroic deeds of the army , and to its officers and men the Major General commanding offers his sincere thanks for their endurance of halsiships heretofore unknown in the American Army . The work you have accomplished may well appeal to the pride of your countrymen and has been rivaled upon but few occasions in the world 's history .

The outlook from Sevilla was one that might well have appalled the stoutest heart . Behind you ran a narrow road , made well-nigh impassable by rains , while to the front you looked out upon high foothills covered with a dense tropical growth , which could only be traversed by bridle paths terminating within range of the enemy 's guns . Nothing deterred , you responded eagerly to the order to close upon the foe , and , attacking at Caney and San Juan , drove him from work to work until he took refuge within his last and strongest intrenchments , immediately surrounding the city . Despite the fierce glare of a Southern sun and rains that fell in torrents , you valiantly withstood his attempts to drive you from the position youi valor had won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after seventeen days of battle and siege you were rewarded by the surrender of nearly 24,000 prisoners , 12,000 being those in your immediate front , the others scattered In the various towns of Eastern Cuba , freeing completely the eastern part of the Island from Spanish troops . This was not done without great sacrifices . The death of 230 gallant soldiers and the wounding of 1,284 others shows but too plainly the fierce contest in which you were engaged . The few reported missing are undoubtedly among the dead , as no prisoners were lost . For those who have fallen in battle with you the commanding General sorrows , and . with you , will ever cherish their memory . Their devotion to duty sets a high example of courage and patriotism to our fellow-countrymen .
