txt Reports that have been received at the Navy Department from San Francisco relative to the battleship Iowa are to the effect that the ship is really in excellent condition , and that the long run from New York was made by her without any accident of consequence . Engineer-in-Chief Melville said to-day that all that the ship needed in the machinery department after this extended voyage was a new set of tubes for the boilers , and these tubes are required to be replaced periodically in every ship in active service .

The retubing should be completed within ten days , when the Iowa will go to Bremerton dry dock , Puget Sound , to receive her bilge keels . This work will occupy thirty days more at least , so that allowing a sufficient time for coaling and equipuing the vessel for a long run across the Pacific , the Iowa will probably start for Manila about the first week in June . She probably will be accompanied by one of the naval transports or colliers , and it may be that the Badger will be assigned to this service , for it is not deemed to be altogether prudent for a battleship to undertake so long a voyage without company . When the Iowa arrives at Manila she will relieve the Oregon on that station . The Oregon will need docking about that time , and it is said here that it is not desirable that the attempt should be made to do this at Hongkong , owing to doubt as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship .
