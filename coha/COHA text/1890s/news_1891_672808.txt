txt The more the affairs of the firm of FIELD , LINDLEY , WIECHERS &; CO. are investigated the more astonishing is the result . The one man who could tell what has become of the money is reported to be in a condition of health that renders it impossible to question him . But it is because men are liable to attacks of illness and fallible in memory that the art of bookkeeping has been invented . In any honestly and well conducted firm it would be possible to find oat by its books where it had stood , and what has become of the money it had . Yet in this case the assignee appears to be as much in the dark as anybody else . The liabilities are of great but unknown extent . The assets , so far as he has been able to discover , are a check for $500 and another for $2,025 . Evidently the firm has been " gutted " by its senior partner . Whether he is mentally responsible for his own acts is a question that may arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can justify anybody in assuming his irresponsibility beforehand . He appeared sane enough a , few weeks ago to induce shrewd men of business to engage with him in transactions amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars . He appeared to his own partners sane enough to induce them to intrust him with all their possessions , and they are now impoverished in consequence of their confidence , while they can not ascertain whether he has put their money in his own pocket or thrown it out of the window . There has scarcely been such a failure since the famous failure of GRANT &; WARD , which was the result of extending confidence to a " confidence man . " But there have been many failures and troubles in business of late that indicate the need of making examples of men who violate the confidence without which business could not be carried on for a day . Confidence is the first requisite for an honest man of business , and it is the first requisite also for a swindler . Every " disgraceful " failure is first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , like WARD or FIELD ; the President of an institution , - like HOEY , or BEERS , or ANDREWS , takes advantage of his position to commit a breach of trust for his own benefit . Mr. ANDREWS , it seems , has induced the Directors a the Standard Gas Company to give up the prosecution of him , but the silence observed in regard to the terms of the settlement can not be regarded as a " vindication . " No more deliberate and outrageous treachery was ever committed than that which HOEY practiced upon his stockholders , or BEERS upon his policy holders . It is both disgraceful and dangerous to the community that such breaches of trust should be left unpunished . The compounding of a felony , at common law and in the forum of morals , is a very serious offense . Yet it is an offense that is very frequently committed , whenever a large defalcation or a disgraceful failure occurs , not only with impunity , but with general acquiescence . It is assumed that if a , thief makes restitution he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . and a very dangerous crime , and that the man at whose immediate expense it has been practiced is bought off from prosecuting it does not in the least interfere with the rights or the duties of the public . Every one of the cases we have cited constitutes a case for the investigation of the Public Prosecutor . Every one of them has been falsely assumed to be a private affair between the offender and his creditors . A breach of trust is not a transaction that concerns only the man in possession of other people 's money and the people of whose money he is in possession . If they could catch him and make him disgorge their property , or what he had left of it , the claims of public justice are assumed to be satisfied . Nothing could so encourage the practice of theft as to let the thief know that the worst that can happen to him is to have to give up his plunder , and that he is liable to punishment only if he fails to restore it . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thieves . If a tramp picks a pocket , he is sent to jail all the same even if the contents of the pocket are restored to the owner . But if he steals a large amount by committing a breach of trust we have permitted him , ever since JAY GOULD 'S restitution to the Erie , and long before , to go at large and to resume business as if nothing had happen:id . They manage these things better in some other countries . There theft is regarded not merely as a private inconvenience , but as a public offense , and it is punished , even if the person stolen from professes an uuwillingness to prosecute . A New-Yorker caught stealing exerts himself to see if he can not buy off his victims with part of their own money . In Paris or in Berlin he is aware that such a course will not save him , and he is apt to take refuge in suicide , as certain swindling bankers in Berlin . have just done . What is everybody 's business , or even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New-York to be nobody 's business . The Stook . Exchange , which has done very much for commercial morality , has now an opportunity to render it a very important service . If the Exchange were - to assume for itself the responsibility of prosecution whenever , in. the judgment of its Governors , such a course were required , it would do a great deal toward diminishing the number of " disgraceful failures .
