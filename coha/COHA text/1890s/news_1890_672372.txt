txt In the course of some comments upon the Senate Anti-Trust bill , the Engineering and Xining Journal expresses the opinion that " there is little probability of its passage , " and adds these interesting remarks : " The fact is that most of the Senators are nnanalally interested in ' Trusts ' of the character they denounce in this bill . Senator SHERMAN , who introduced the measure , le , we are reliably informed , Interested in several such ' oombinations in restraint of trade . ' " But how can any one believe such a report as this about a Senator who denounced combinations throughout several speeches in support of this bill , and who said on the 21st ult. : " Sir , now the people of the ' United States as well as of other countries are feeling the power and grasp of these combinations , and are deMantling of every Legislature and of Congress a remedy for this evil , only grown into huge proportions in recent times . They had monopolies and mortmalns of old , bat never before suoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal or be ready for the Socialist , the Communist , and the Nihilist . Society is now disturbed by forces never felt before . " We do not forget , it is trim , that Mr. SHERMAN has repeatedly declared that such combinations should be punished by a reduction or the entire removal of the tariff duties on foreign goods like their own , and that , in strange contradiction of these declarations , he has persistently voted against such changes in the duties mentioned . We have never seen any adequate explanation of this inconsistency . The Engineering and Mining Journal should furnish a bill of particulars , so that the soundness of the information can be tested .
