txt In the early days of last month the Controller of the City of New-York asked for bids for bonds of the city bearing interest at 3 per cent. , payable in currency . He got no bids at all . He then asked for authority to issue bonds bearing interest at 3174 per cent. , and obtained it . That is , he found it necessary for the city to pay one-sixth , or 17 per cent. , more for money needed to carry on current business than it had previously paid . But before acting upon this authorization ? which was clearly demanded if the city was to depend on currency bonds  --  the Controller concluded to use the discretion vested in him by the statutes , make the bonds payable in gold , at the older and lower rate of interest , and see what would come of it . Accordingly , he asked for bids for some three and a quarter millions of 3 per cent . gold bonds . He got bids for over twelve and a half millions at from 100.29 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a loan on 4 per cent . bonds , for which the lenders were ready to pay only 104.4 , bringing the interest paid by the Government to 3% per cent . The lenders offered to take bonds specifically payable in gold at a rate bringing the interest down to 3 per cent. , but Congress , less wise and less honorable than the Legislature of the State of New York , refused the authority . We all know that this blind and wicked refusal w ill cost the people of the United States some $1 ( ; , 000,000 . But that is not all that it will cost . It is , in fact , a mere drop in the bucket . As Mr. Fitch very clearly shows , the difference in the credit cf the United States Government and the credit of the City of New-York is the difference between 104 and 119 . That is to say , where the taxpayers of this city have to pay $100 for necessary loans , the taxpayers of the United States will have to pay nearly $115 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! the vast indebtedness incurred by the people of the various cities , counties , and States of this Union , according as that indebtedness is honorably paid in gold or is payable in a currency which the stupidity of Congress has discredited . How great that indebtedness is may be seen  --  but only in part  --  from the facts given in the census of 1890 . At that time the total net debt for State , county , city , and school district , in the United States , was over a billion of dollars , ( $1,135,000 , - 000 . ) Of this enormous sum , the municipal debt was much the larger share , being $734,000,000 . The State debt was $ " .29 , - 000,000 , the county debt $145,000,000 , and the school district debt $37,000,000 . This was divided among the different sections of the country as follows : North Atlantic qz-leb.S , t ) oomoo South Atlantic ltiti , ( 041,000 North Central aeo , oetetes ) SouthCentral ... ..... 138.000,000 Western 43,000,000 Total S1 135,000,000 The North Atlantic States are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania . The South Atlantic are the States from Delaware to Florida , inclusive . The North Central embrace what were formerly known as the Western States , from the Ohio to the Mississippi . The South Central are the Southern States west of the coast States , and the Western include most of the new States , with Oregon and California . It will be seen that nearly $800,000,000 of the debt is owed in the North Atlantic and North Central States . But while the debt of the former declined between 1880 and 1890 from $541,000,000 to $498,000 , - 0:10 , or 13 per cent. , the debt of the latter increased in that decade from $240,000,000 to $320,090,000 , or 30 per cent . The debt of the Western division , with the new States , also advanced from $24,000,000 to $43,000,000 , or nearly 80 per cent . It is noteworthy also that this increase is almost wholly in county and city debt , and chiefly in the latter , and this tendency is equally marked in the Southern States . Now , it is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold payments find the sentiment they profess to obey . To some extent , undoubtedly , that sentiment exists ; but we are persuaded on the one hand that it is not in reality nearly so strong as it is represented to be , and , on the other hand , that it would be much lessened if the people of these regions could understand the actual effect of the policy pursued in their name . The only possible basis of this sentiment is that if the debts of the country are payable in currency  --  that is , in paper or silver ? it will be easier to pay them But the facts show exactly the contrary . It is not easier to pay $115 in currency than $100 in gold , and when the added 15 per cent . on the interest has to be paid every year so long as the debt runs , the burden is increased proportionately . The people of these sections are flattered by men , some of whom know better , with the notion that senders can be compelled to take the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again the facts show the contrary . No man in this free country can be made to lend his money save on his own terms , and the possibility that an attempt may be made to compel him to take what he thinks- poorer money than he is entitled to is met by higher terms . In our country , and especially in the portions of it like the West and the new South , in which resources and energy are boundless , but accumulated capital is limited , a large part of private business and all public improvements must rely on borrowed capital . Clearly it is the interest of the borrowers to get that capital at as low a rate as possible . The record we have cited shows beyond all question that this can only be done where payment in gold is secured . It is simply the old , old lesson on a very large scale , that honesty is the best policy .
