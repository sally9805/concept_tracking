Note : 1Kb Main text ACT I SCENE : A room in Yorick 's house . Enter Gregory . L. 2 . E. preceding the two servants . One of them bears Alice 's portrait heavily framed . The other , an easel . GREGORY : Hither , hither ! This way , I say . Look that you mar it not , or woe upon your lives . ' T were the same in my master 's eyes as if you offered wrong to Mistress Alice herself . PHILLIP , with easel : Nay , we know our part . Master Warrener hath given us our charges . ( Placing and arranging easel R. H. near window . R. 2 . E. ) Here , brother , set it here . GREGORY , regarding easel : And what manner of strange three-legged beast is that , pray thee ? TOBIAS , setting picture upon the easel : Ay ! A beast , indeed ! Well said , Goodman Gregory , for it 's called by the Frenchman " a little horse "  --  and by your Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutchman  --  " an ass . " " It will not kick , it will not shy , " quoth our master . " Fear not , ' twill bear you safely . " Said he not so , brother ? PHILLIP : Ay , that he did . And then we laughed , ha ! ha ! ha ! We know how to laugh at his sayings . Then he gave us each a sixpence and bade us go drink a mug of ale to his good health . TOBIAS , significantly to Gregory : Ah , he gave us sixpence each  --  PHILLIP : And bade us go drink  --  TOBIAS : Ay , to your fair mistress ' health . PHILLIP : He gave us  --  TOBIAS : Truly , ' t was sixpence each . No less  --  GREGORY : O , a plague o ' ye . Think ye that ye should leave Yorick 's roof without remembrance on Yorick 's birthday ? There ! There ! Ye varlets ! ( Gives them money . ) Get ye gone . TOBIAS , crossing to R. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to L. : My service to you , master . Exeunt , L. 2 . E. GREGORY : Master ! Master ! Well ! ' t is a good lad ! He meant no harm , though I am but Yorick 's poor old serving man : " Master ! " Ay ! He meant well . ' T was a good face . I liked not the other , with his bold " goodman " and his " Gregory 's . " Enter Dorothy . R. 2 . E. DOROTHY : What art thou moping and mowing at now , Gregory ? GREGORY : A saucy knave , I say , to call me goodman . DOROTHY : A saucy knave , indeed ! I would never call thee , " goodman . " ' T was the same as I should say " husband , " and that were too bold . GREGORY , flattered : Not in thee , sweet Dorothy . Not in thy mouth . DOROTHY : Nay ! Nay ! I know the respect that should be paid to age and its infirmities . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ha ! ( Gregory goes indignantly and places himself before the easel . ) What hast thou there , Gaffer Gregory , that I partly spy through the ribs of thy skeleton ? GREGORY : Never ask aught of me , thou jade ! Look for thyself if thou mayst face the effigy of one that is a daily reproof to all lightness and folly . DOROTHY , going to picture : O , Mistress Alice 's picture sent home ! I care not for Mistress Alice 's picture . GREGORY : And why , Mistress Malapert ? DOROTHY : Because I care not for the moonlight when the sun shines , or for a death 's head when thou art by . ( Coaxingly . ) Wilt thou marry me , Gaffer Gregory ? ' T is the fashion of the house for old men to mate with young wives . And I would mourn for thee truly when thou madest me a widow . ( A knock . ) There ! Thou art called ! Stay not to woo . Fly ! fly ! thou spectre ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edmund ? GREGORY : No , chatterer ! for Master Yorick . DOROTHY : Oh ! Methought Master Edmund might at least have the shadow . Poor Master Edmund ! He should be an old man . GREGORY : What dost thou mean ? Thou  --  Knocking heard again . DOROTHY : Dost thou stay yet ? Why , thou wilt linger when Death knocks for thee . Run  --  limp  --  crawl . ( Exit Gregory L. 2 . E. She goes to portrait . ) Oh ! Dost thou think I am blind , Mistress ? Thou , a reproof to folly ! Re-enter Gregory , ushering in Heywood . GREGORY : Good Master Heywood . You have come upon the instant . Dorothy R. C. curtsies to Heywood . HEYWOOD : For what , Gregory ? For what ? GREGORY , indicating portrait : To welcome Mistress Alice home . HEYWOOD , crossing to picture : So Master Warrener hath finished his work in time ! ( To Dorothy . ) Let thy mistress know my coming , pretty Dorothy . ( She curtsies and exits R. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' t is a quaint fancy , and like Yorick to make himself a gift of his wife 's portrait on his birthday . GREGORY : ' T is all his love of her . ' T is like father and daughter to see them together . His hair just touched with frost and hers all sunshine . ' T is like April and October . I can think of nothing else . HEYWOOD , absently : And Yorick is five and forty today ! GREGORY : Truly ! Truly ! You are right , Master Heywood ! And Mistress Alice is a good child  --  a good child  --  and she hath never turned to look at any of the fine court gallants that go mad of her beauty and write themselves blind upon her eyebrows . ALICE , who has entered R. 3 . E. unknown to Gregory : Thanks , good Gregory ! But defend me not to every one or thou wilt make the world suspect me . GREGORY : Nay , never fear for me , Mistress Alice . I am no fool ! ALICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make ready against thy master 's coming . He will be here anon . ( Exit Gregory . L. 2 . E. ) I have made you wait , Master Heywood . Cry you mercy ! ( Drops a curtsy in mock humility . ) HEYWOOD , indicating portrait with exaggerated compliment : Nay ! You have been here ever since I came ; only I marvel you did not speak before . ALICE , archly : Was it too long for a woman to keep silence ? You think the picture is not like , then ? HEYWOOD : Like ? Oh ! a good map . ALICE , crossing to portrait : " Map "  --  do you call it ? That 's a phrase for Master Warrener , the limner , when I shall tell him the terms of Master Heywood 's praise . You shall see the painter 's pencil to a rapier turn  --  his palette to a buckler  --  and woe to thee when you encounter . Come , now ! Some kinder word . Is it not alive ? Doth it not breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room ? Is there not somewhat of Apelles here ? Oh ! Apelles at the very least . You can not say less than Apelles . HEYWOOD : Well ! Well ! Say Apelles . And all the other masters of antiquity to boot . Truly , if Warrener was not inspired , he should have been . ALICE : What should have been our painter 's inspiration ? HEYWOOD : Thy goodness , child , that shines through every word ; all slaves of thine , transfiguring all thy life . There , I have made thee blush . ALICE , evasively : I am sorry Yorick is not here . HEYWOOD : Nay ! My errand was half to you . I came to wish you joy  --  both you and Yorick  --  of this happy day . ALICE , trying to recover herself : Only to wish us joy ? HEYWOOD : Oh ! Ay ! And to temper his raptures a little with some talk of affairs . ALICE : I might have known it . Atlas is ever bearing up the globe . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Can not you leave us poor fictions of your stage one little day of real life ? I was trying to feign myself the happy wife of a happy husband  --  in and for myself  --  not in a play  --  but in very truth  --  and here you come  --  HEYWOOD : Is it so difficult a fancy then , that you can not resume it afterwards when we have spoken of the play ? ALICE : Difficult ? What mean you , Master Heywood ? HEYWOOD : I ? I ? I meant nothing . YORICK , entering L. 2 . E. : Nothing whatever , I will dare be sworn . What was he saying ? ALICE , embarrassed : Oh ! Nothing ! Nothing ! YORICK : Why , so I said ! HEYWOOD : Yorick , I came to wish you many happy days like this , but happier and brighter each , till your round century makes you last of us . YORICK Oh ! Do not wish me to outlive my friends ! But I 'll live on another fifty years In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made men laugh , till not one bitter drop Lurked in his blood for any one on earth . HEYWOOD Not even Walton ! YORICK Nay , not even Walton . HEYWOOD Well ! I believe it . And die when thou wilt , I will write down these words thy epitaph . There 's nothing that I should enjoy so much As writing Yorick 's epitaph . YORICK Laughing . Why , that Is like a friend , indeed . ALICE Oh ! Do not talk Of epitaphs on such a day as this . Places herself before the portrait as if to hide it . YORICK Nay , thou say'st well . Our talk should be , methinks , of lofty themes , Of beauty made immortal ! Of sweet eyes Bidden shine with fadeless luster when ours Are dim with dust . Our talk should be of fine arts  --  Of the art The limner hath to mirror loveliness And the art of loveliness to hide itself . Ah ! What art can equal thine ? Hast seen it , Heywood ? HEYWOOD Ay , I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it , then ? ALICE Oh ! You should have heard him only now Lording it with fine phrases  --  bidding me Tell Master Warrener ' t was a good map . YORICK Map ? And why , sweetheart  --  so it is a map . It is the world  --  the world in which I live  --  The pleasant country where my soul abides . Map is not so ill , and yet a better word Methinks he might have chosen  --  say , a landscape . There are your golden harvest fields of hair . Here your white brow  --  a buckwheat field in bloom , And here those lovely blue , twin lakes  --  your eyes  --  From which like rounded shores do rise your cheeks , A wilderness of roses and of lilies . And here your lips  --  and here your lips  --  ALICE Oh ! Come ! Come ! Get you to my lips . YORICK Kissing her . Why so I will . ALICE Nay  --  nay , I meant not that . You shall not cheat me of the proper phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like A wheatfield or a haystack  --  and my brow As brown as buckwheat meal  --  ah ! And my eyes  --  Pale watery green like two dull pools  --  My checks Purple as thistles  --  and my lips  --  my lips . YORICK Rapturously . The praise of them is inarticulate . A bird might chirp out something like the sound . ALICE Or a door creak it . YORICK Heywood , you have not wished me half the joy That is my due this day . HEYWOOD Then take the rest With all my heart . YORICK And didst thou not remember My birthday also was our wedding day ? HEYWOOD I do remember now , but on my word I had forgotten . I wish you joy again . YORICK Two years ago a fair and trusting girl Laid her dear hand in mine , who might have been Her father  --  but that the youth within my love Made me the youngest husband in the land . If I should tell thee how she hath blessed my life , ' T would seem such profanation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak . ALICE O Yorick . YORICK There is no speck . No fear in my content . I am so wholly , absolutely happy , Except  --  except  --  Why is not Edmund here ? Is it my fancy that I find him cold ? This is his home , and Edmund is my son . And yet I rarely see him at my board And never more a night beneath my roof . HEYWOOD : The boy is steeped in study . ALICE : Yes  --  Yorick  --  ' t is his study  --  do not think of it . ( Knock is heard L. 2 E. ) Why , that 's his knock ! YORICK : The time hath been he hath not stayed to knock . Enter Gregory L. 2 E. GREGORY : Master Yorick  --  YORICK : Is Edmund there ? GREGORY : Master Yorick  --  YORICK : Does he wait to be announced ? Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Let me usher in this Sir Punctilio ! Runs into Woodford 's arms who enters . GREGORY : There ! There ! I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might have told me in the course of time , but never mind . ( Exit Gegory L. 2 E. To Woodford . ) You , sir ! Whom I have taken so warmly to my heart . You shall not say I drove you from my door . Welcome ! HEYWOOD : This is the author of our new play . Brave Master Woodford , whom a fortnight hence , I shall not need to name to any one . They salute and Yorick leads him up to portrait of Alice . YORICK And this is Mistress Alice , Yorick 's wife . Woodford stares confusedly . HEYWOOD Laughing . Yorick ! Yorick ! What a mad wag thou art ! YORICK And this is her picture painted in oils After the new Venice fashion , and but now Sent home by Master Warrener , the limner . Is it not like , sir ? How cunningly The painter hath counterfeited nature In those eyes that seem to move and To have speculation in them . See this Smiling mouth that might at any moment Break in laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good sir ! I do entreat your pardon For my error for which the painter 's skill Is much to blame . I see more clearly now , And I do assure you that yonder Is the portrait , and this is the Lady . Trust me , ' t is so  --  this  --  this is Mistress Alice . WOODFORD The heroine , I hope , in my new play . ALICE Why , that shall be as Master Heywood wills . We are but puppets in his sovereign hands . We rage , we languish , burn with hate or love , Kiss  --  kill  --  weep  --  live  --  die  --  or walk as ghosts Just as he chooses to appoint our parts . He is a pitiless tyrant to us players . I hope his poets find him merciful . WOODFORD Why , truly , Madame , I have nothing To lament in Master Heywood 's usage . My play coming to him as it hath With Master Shakespeare 's praise , ' t is not as if It were unfriended  --  and ' t is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Shakespeare praised it ? Then I warrant me He hath not indulged his envious wont Of striking all the good things from your pages . WOODFORD Why , truly , as to that , good Master Yorick , We have not agreed as I could wish On certain passages . At his insistence , I have greatly reduced the speeches . YORICK Oh ! Shameful ! WOODFORD And several scenes I have suppressed . ALICE Oh ! Cruel ! WOODFORD And some of the highest languaged encounters Where I had spent my very best on verse , I have , at his instance , resolved to native prose . ALICE : Why , this is sacrilege ! HEYWOOD : Come , Mistress Alice , if you embroil me with this poet again , whom , after this endeavor , I have brought to know his place under the manager 's feet , I swear you shall play his whole tragedy yourself . WOODFORD : Ha ! ha ! ha ! Very good , i ' faith ! Very good , good  --  m'lady ! If Mistress Alice might but play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have flattered him already ! Yorick , will you not use a husband 's authority ? YORICK : Nay , she does my pleasure , whatever she may do . But let us hear Master Woodford expound the argument of his play  --  How runs it , sir ? WOODFORD : The manner of my tragedy is this  --  The Count Octavio hath a young wife , and his son loves her  --  This is known to all . ALICE : What ? WOODFORD : That the young man loves his adoptive father 's wife . This is known to all  --  to all  --  but the Count Octavio , of course . It ever befalls so  --  Ha ! ha ! ha ! YORICK : ' T is true  --  ' t is a good point  --  ' t is nature . WOODFORD : Then the Count hath a familiar , one Landolfo , who by means of a letter acquaints him with the guilt of his son and his wife . ALICE : Horrible ! WOODFORD : Ay ! ' t is strong ! And so they fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slain ? WOODFORD : By his father 's hand . I had a touch there that Shakespeare pronounced the best in the play . YORICK : ' T is a good argument . And these are the chief persons : the count and his son  --  What call you him ? WOODFORD : Manfredo . ' T is in Spanish taste . YORICK : Ay ! And the wife  --  WOODFORD : Beatrice . YORICK : Very good ! And then this villain , Landolfo . Master Heywood , of whom think you for the part of Beatrice ? HEYWOOD : Mistress Alice , with your leave . YORICK : Excellent . And whom have you chosen for Manfredo ? Edmund ! HEYWOOD : You have guessed . YORICK : I could not have erred . There are no such lovers as they to be found in any theatre . Excellent well ! And the villain goes to Walton . HEYWOOD : Why , there I have been given pause . Walton is a good villain . YORICK : Nature framed him so . HEYWOOD : Nay , you said but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Said I so ? I lied . I did but wish I had none . HEYWOOD : Well ! Here comes the rub . Walton is our first player  --  and the Count Octavio is the principal part . If I give him the villain , who will play Octavio ? YORICK : Ah ! ( Pause . ) Is there no part in the new play for me , Master Woodford ? WOODFORD : Sir , you honor me past all deserving . But my poor play is a tragedy . YORICK : Ay , So !  --  And yet methinks  --  or am I wrong to think it ?  --  Shakespeare writ tragedy ? WOODFORD : The highest . YORICK : And still he put some light heart jester in . WOODFORD : Oh , there by your leave  --  I have thought Master Shakespeare out of taste . YORICK I do remember me that once the Master Would have me walk with him in London streets Where oft he loved to note the passing crowd And make his studies from the life . It chanced That , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pray thee , what is tragedy ? " I cried . We had stopped to hear a strolling mountebank Making the crowd roar with his cap and bells When , on a sudden , there arose a shriek And a wild mother caught her dead child up From under flying wheels . The fool who noted not Capered and babbled on . But the great Master Seized on my arm and pointed " There ! There ! " ' T was all he said . WOODFORD : Grant you that ! But we do not copy life . We but choose  --  banish  --  and reject . YORICK : Ay ! So ! Well , I would fain see your play though I be elected  --  chosen  --  banished  --  and rejected out of it . By your favor , Master Woodford , you will stay dinner with us  --  will you not ? WOODFORD : Good Master Yorick , hold me excused for on a day of private merry making I must not stay . Pray , Madame , let me commend to your special kindness the part you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Beatrice the best Octavio and Landolfo in the world can not save it  --  fail it must . And though it be so opposite , Madame , to your natural frame , to play the part of a lady who loves not her lord , let it not displease you , for at the worst she is innocent and doth take  --  ALICE : Enough ! Enough ! I understand ! WOODFORD : You shall see the delicacy with which I have endeavored it . A lawless and unhappy love so treated  --  the son to love his benefactor 's wife . ALICE : It is too terrible . WOODFORD : And yet loving her not willingly  --  ALICE : No more  --  no more  --  WOODFORD : Ay ! It kindles your fancy . I 'm glad of that . And for Master Edmund ! He will not play his part  --  he will live it . ALICE : Merciful Heaven ! WOODFORD : There is a scene where the lovers are together , and the husband comes suddenly upon them . ALICE : Prithee , no more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very action  --  ' t is marvellous fine . If you can do it  --  so in my play they shall ' plaud you to the skies . ' T is the very truth of nature ! YORICK : Truth ! You do well to praise her in that word . The secret of her art  --  the secret of her life is truth . ALICE : Good Master , you see how the mere argument of your tragedy plays upon a weak woman 's nerves . Think what havoc it shall work upon the scenes  --  and write comedy hereafter . DOROTHY , entering R. 2 . E. : Mistress Alice ! The cook hath sent me . ALICE : Ay ! Ay ! Master Woodford , the Tenth Muse calls me . Fare you well . Write comedy hereafter . She curtsies and goes out with Dorothy . HEYWOOD : By my soul , she is herself all the muses in one  --  ten or ten thousand . WOODFORD : How prettily she mocked away the effect of my tragedy ! YORICK : Yet not the less her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treachery will teach her how to paint it best . WOODFORD : If she but paint it to the world , as now she colored it for us , she will make me immortal . But she shall not make you wish my death now in defect of my absence . Farewell , Master Yorick , Master Heywood . I will await you at the Mitre ? Give you good day , gentlemen . YORICK : Save you , Master Woodford , to write many tragedies . Woodford goes of L. 2 . E. HEYWOOD : Now , Yorick ! Is this some new jest ? YORICK : Not unless you make a jest of it , old friend . HEYWOOD : What wilt thou with me ? YORICK : Honestly , what think you of this drama that you are going to play ? HEYWOOD : Honestly , then , I like it very much . YORICK : And is it the youngster 's first play ? HEYWOOD : His first . He showed it to Shakespeare , who commended it to me . And now , what thinkest thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . YORICK : I think very well of it , too . Though I note some blemishes in it . HEYWOOD : Oh ! Let the envious find the blemishes . We will look only at the beauties . YORICK : Ay , thou who hast never felt the sting of envy  --  thou who hast not to envy others  --  HEYWOOD : The envious never lack for something to envy . YORICK : I should know something of envy in such a hot bed of envy as the theatre . But thou hast done well , Master , to lay down the actor 's part and keep only the poet . HEYWOOD : Nay , there are noble exceptions to the rule . YORICK : Surely ! My wife and Edmund are living proof of that . Heaven has given me the great happiness of seeing in this life the reward of whatever good I have done . Because I have striven to be faithful and generous , He hath given me in Alice a wife of angelic truth and in Edmund a friend  --  a friend ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent  --  what genius they have ! How they play Romeo and Juliet together ! The lovers whom Shakespeare gave being are marvellous creatures , but how much more wonderful they are when Alice and Edmund lend their human form and souls . What gestures ! What glances ! What passionate embodiment of love ! ' T is his very truth of nature ! HEYWOOD , aside : Alas ! Poor Yorick ! ( To Yorick . ) And now may I retire ? YORICK : Nay , Master , not yet . Not until I have said a word to the manager of our theatre  --  the laurelled poet  --  to  --  HEYWOOD : By Heaven ! These sugared endearments cloy me . I might have known thou hadst something to ask me  --  and wast striving to pay me for the favor in advance . YORICK : Yes , truly , I have a favor to ask . HEYWOOD : Ask it then . YORICK : That is what I would like to do if only I knew how . HEYWOOD : Why , man ! Speak out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the part of Octavio ? HEYWOOD : I think it will go to Walton , who is incomparable in that way . YORICK : I knew it . To whom should any great part go , except to Walton ? What luck the bitter rascal has ! HEYWOOD : Walton was very unhappy in his youth ; he should have your pity . For the last time , farewell . YORICK : But I have not yet said  --  HEYWOOD : Say on then . YORICK : I would like  --  I would like  --  But you are not to mock at me . HEYWOOD : By Heaven , if you do not speak  --  YORICK : I would like  --  HEYWOOD : What ! Speak ! Or I shall vanish through the trap . YORICK : I should like to play that part . HEYWOOD : What part ? YORICK : That in the new play . HEYWOOD : But which ? YORICK : That of the Count Octavio . HEYWOOD : That of the husband ? YORICK : That  --  HEYWOOD : Thou ? YORICK : I. HEYWOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou art perilously ill . YORICK : Why , so the fools talk . And I talking like a fool that knew only thy tragedies would have said thou wert incapable of writing comedy . Because I have done nothing till now but interpret jest and merriment , must I be condemned never to leave the beaten path ? HEYWOOD : To leave it for the unknown mountain-top ? Why , thou hast been so long the very type , and arch-conceit of mirth that when Shakespeare cast about him for some name by which the sweetest and dearest wit should be known  --  the jester who enthralled the memory of his melancholy Dane with tenderness and delight , he could not but make free with thine and call him Yorick . If Hamlet live to after-time  --  and sometimes I think the poor Prince will survive us both in spite of Laertes ' venomed point  --  thou shalt go down with him , the bright foil of his dark sadness to remotest fame . YORICK : I thank our Master for an immortality for which I shall be none the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a present triumph . HEYWOOD : Yorick , Yorick , till now thou hast tried to make people laugh and they have laughed . Woe to thee when thou seekest to make them weep , and they continue to laugh . YORICK : Ungracious Master , deny so slight a boon to one who was ever thy loyal friend ? Very well , give the Count 's part then to another , but then we are no longer friends and next year I will quit your theatre , and with me goes Alice  --  and Edmund , too . We shall see then which of the two is the greater loser . HEYWOOD : And there is really no one in the world contented with his lot . YORICK : Must one forever be amused with the business of amusing others ? HEYWOOD : Didst thou speak seriously ? Couldst thou in truth abandon me ? YORICK : Abandon thee ! I said it , and thou didst not believe me . When thou didst doubt my talent , nothing more was wanting but that thou shouldst doubt my heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know how to feign what he feels , but he knows how to feel . Thou woundest him  --  thou puttest him to shame  --  and he  --  look , Master  --  he opens his arms to thee . HEYWOOD : Good heavens ! Tears ? YORICK : I weep because it is not Walton alone who holds me for a gross buffoon , fit only to make fools burst into stupid laughter . Because I see that thou , too  --  Heaven help me ! What an unhappy wretch I am . HEYWOOD : Oh , devil take thee . Dost thou wish the part of the husband ? ' T is thine , then , and much good may it do thee . YORICK : Truly ? Thou speakest truly ? HEYWOOD : Ay , glut this cursed fancy from which I have vainly endeavored to wean thee . YORICK : But if I should succeed in the part  --  HEYWOOD : And if they strike thee dead with hisses . YORICK : Nothing ventured  --  nothing gained . I should like to do it well if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou wilt not do it ill in thine own . YORICK : Go , friend , and take the air . HEYWOOD : I desire nothing so much . YORICK : In good sooth , Master , if they should applaud me in the part  --  HEYWOOD : Well ! YORICK : My joy would be very great . HEYWOOD : And mine , Yorick , no less . Gives his hand and goes out L. 2 . E. YORICK : " Oh ! It 's easy to make people laugh , " I heard Walton say to his friends the other night . But they shall see that with this part of the Count Octavio I know how to make them weep when there is need . They shall see  --  and they shall rage to see . And as I have hitherto poured mirth , I can pour pity and terror into every heart . But I must go carefully . This part of the Count Octavio hath its difficulties , and at the slightest misstep I should fall and break my neck . " Tremble , faithless woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " Tremble , unfaithful woman ! Tremble , ingrate , Who robbest me of mine honor and my peace , Vain all thy subtleties . Here stands thy guilt revealed . " To begin with , he opens the letter , " My blood is frozen in my veins . " " Thou art the villain  --  thou ! " Oh ! If I could only do it as I feel it . EDMUND , outside : Very well , Gregory . Enters . YORICK : Ah ! Ingrate ! Thou to be the last to wish me joy upon this happy day . But never mind , my boy ! Dost thou not know I am to have a great part in the new play ? EDMUND : I rejoice to hear it , sir . YORICK , earnestly : Edmund , for some time past , thou hast called me " Sir " instead of " Father " and I have reprehended thee in vain . " Tremble , unfaithful woman ! " Is it for some fault of mine that thou deniest me the clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that name . YORICK : Since when ? Ah ! Edmund ! Thou art losing the old tenderness that thou hadst for me . EDMUND : Oh ! No ! What has made you fancy that ? YORICK : Thou wouldst be less reserved with me if thou didst love me still . EDMUND : And how am I reserved with you ? YORICK : In not telling me the cause of thy sadness . EDMUND : I , sad ? YORICK : Sad , and full of disquiet . Can it be thou art in love ? EDMUND : In love ? I ? Do you think  --  YORICK : So I think ? It would seem that I had accused thee of a crime . Ah ! love may be a crime . Dost thou love another 's wife ? EDMUND , starts : Oh ! YORICK : Thou art pale . Thy hand trembles . EDMUND : Yes  --  surely  --  you look at me in such a way . YORICK : Infirm must be thy conscience when a look can startle thee . Consider well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm as the thief who steals his honor  --  nor he who wounds his body as the assassin who strikes at his soul . Edmund , do not do this ! Ah ! My son ! for the love of Heaven ! forbear ! EDMUND : You suspect me without cause . I do assure you . YORICK : I believe thee  --  Thou wouldst not deceive me . And is it not droll that Alice should be going to play the guilty wife , and thou the gay seducer in this new drama ? EDMUND , dissembling : Yes  --  YORICK : And I  --  I  --  I am to do the injured husband . EDMUND : You ? YORICK : Yes , I ! Does it surprise thee ? EDMUND : No ! YORICK : Oh ! Art thou , too , one of those who think I can not play a serious part ? EDMUND : No  --  sir  --  no  --  unless  --  that is  --  YORICK : Faith ! I have no slight task before me . In the first place , no part could suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not an idea what kind of animal a jealous man is . Alice  --  as thou knowest well  --  has never caused me a pang of jealousy , and never will as long as I live . It is not possible to doubt so high and pure a creature . EDMUND : No , sir ! It is not possible . YORICK : Thou speakest coldly , Edmund . Thou dost ill to try to hide what I have now some time noted . EDMUND : Have you noted anything ? What ? What have you noted ? YORICK : That while Alice is no less thy friend than ever , thou sometimes lookest on her with aversion . EDMUND : You have noted that ? YORICK : And I understand the reason . Thou didst reign alone in my heart before Alice became my wife , and it vexes thee to share thy empire with her . Egotist ! Promise me to make thy peace with her this very day , and hereafter thou must call her simply " Alice . " It were even better thou shouldst call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be since you have both the same father . EDMUND , aside : What misery ! YORICK : Dost thou know what I think ? If thou art so jealous as a son , thou shouldst be something terrible as a jealous lover . They say that there is no passion so potent as this same jealousy  --  that it dominates the whole soul  --  and makes one forget everything else . EDMUND : Everything , sir . Ay , everything . YORICK : Of whom hast thou been jealous ? And for what woman 's sake ? Why , thou shalt study the part of the jealous husband with me , and explain how this passion , unknown to me , unfolds itself  --  what kind of torments it occasions  --  and by what outward signs it may be recognized  --  all , in fine , that thou hast felt and known . Begin by reading me this scene here . From this point  --  go on . EDMUND : " Wert thou the villain , thou ? " YORICK : That is what I am to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wert thou the cunning and perfidious knave ? " YORICK : My lad ! Thou couldst not possibly have done that worse . More spirit ! More vehemence ! EDMUND : " The infamous seducer thou  --  that durst  --  " YORICK : More soul  --  more life  --  EDMUND : " Pierce thus the bosom of thine ancient friend . " YORICK : Thou art not in the humor for it today . ( Taking manuscript . ) Listen ! " Wert thou the cunning and perfidious knave ? " Walton enters L. 2 . E. WALTON : Who is raving here ? YORICK : Walton ! WALTON : Wert thou quarrelling with Edmund ? YORICK : I was quarrelling with no one . WALTON : Methought as I came in  --  YORICK , aside : He knows of it already , and is seeking some pretext for a quarrel . WALTON : It seemed to me thou receivest me with little pleasure . YORICK : I divine thy motives . WALTON : Truly , ' t is divination . YORICK : Let us have no idle words . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divined my motives , why should I tell thee ? But what dost thou on foot , good Master Walton ? Here is a chair . Thanks ! Sits . YORICK : Dost thou gird at me with a mock of civilities that pertain to me ? If thou seekest to annoy me ? WALTON : Ah ! This is a pleasant greeting ! Why , he has the spirits of the tiger . Eh , Edmund ? EDMUND : Eh ? Dost thou make a jest of him ? WALTON : ' T is well thou shouldst defend thy friend , Yorick  --  thy protector  --  thy second father . This boy 's a jewel . How pleasant it is to meet agreeable people . EDMUND : Walton ! WALTON : My compliments incommode you ! YORICK : What is thy intent ? WALTON : You are both out of temper today . Fare you well . But thou art the loser . YORICK : I ? Loser ! I ? WALTON : I came here to seek a friend . I find a fool and I am going away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I would not if I could think of a better word . YORICK : Hast thou seen our Master Heywood ? WALTON : No ! Only the author of the new play . YORICK : Well ! WALTON : The Master met him at the Mitre as he came away from you , and told him that you were to do the part of the husband . YORICK : Ah ! Now we understand each other . WALTON : The author came to me in a frenzy , to beg that I should reclaim a part that fitted me  --  and  --  YORICK : And thou  --  Well ! and thou  --  WALTON : I  --  I wish you to know the truth . At first I was furious  --  then I saw that I was wrong  --  and I said to the author  --  But why should I trouble myself to tell you ? YORICK : No ! I listen  --  Come ! What didst thou say to him ? WALTON : I told him that you were my friend  --  that an actor of your merit and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would but throw himself into it  --  that I would play the part of the confidant  --  which is difficult , though detestable  --  that I would aid you with my advice , if you would accept it and  --  Farewell ! YORICK : Nay ! Come hither , man ! Come hither ! Didst thou say that ? WALTON : And when I come here very well pleased with myself , I am received with looks of vinegar and words of gall . By my faith ! I should pay you back in the same coin ! I have mistaken . Going again . YORICK : No ! Thou shalt not go . This is all very strange . WALTON : And why is it so strange ? Come ! Let us hear . YORICK : It would seem more natural thou shouldst be vexed to lose the occasion of a new triumph  --  to see me  --  WALTON : Tut ! Tut ! The temple of fame is so vast that it never yet was filled and never will be . YORICK : Ay , but that bitter humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know not how to feign or lie . YORICK : And thou art not pained that I should have the part of Count Octavio ? WALTON : I have told you  --  no . YORICK : And thou wilt play the part of the confidant ? WALTON : I have told you  --  yes . YORICK : And thou wilt study this part for me ? WALTON : You insult one with your doubts . YORICK , to Edmund : Edmund ! Dost thou hear this ? ( To Walton . ) To be frank with thee  --  I have always held thee till now a subtle rogue . WALTON : So the world judges men . YORICK : Confession is the beginning of repentance  --  If thou art in the humor now to give me half a dozen honest thumps about the head  --  WALTON : Faith ! I owe thee as many  --  YORICK : Begin , then ! And I pray thee in charity , let them be well laid on . WALTON : Enough of this . YORICK : Then give me thy hand . WALTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I  --  I could have sworn  --  Hast thou aught to do at present ? WALTON : Nothing . YORICK : I would fain hear thee read the part before I begin to study it . WALTON : Why , and if thou wilt  --  YORICK : If I will ? Have I not good reason to wish it ? I wish nothing so much . Thou hast astonished me by thy unmeasured goodness and nobleness . Who would ever have imagined that thou  --  WALTON : Wilt thou return to thy offense ? YORICK : No  --  no  --  on the contrary , I meant  --  But come with me to my study . We will lock ourselves in and  --  Frankly , the part of outraged husband seems to me rather difficult . WALTON : Thou are deceived . The part of outraged husband is played without the slightest difficulty . What does Edmund think ? EDMUND : I ? I ? ( Aside . ) What does this man mean ? YORICK : It will be easy to me with thy instructions . And wilt thou teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thou makest such effect ? WALTON : Assuredly . YORICK : And some of those sudden transitions that every one applauds ? WALTON : Without doubt . YORICK : And that touch of feigning tears that makes the public weep ? WALTON : Yes  --  man  --  yes  --  everything that thou wilt . YORICK : And thinkest thou that I shall succeed ? WALTON : Thou wilt triumph . YORICK : Truly ? WALTON : Thou dost not know what thou canst do . YORICK : But  --  but  --  WALTON : Oh , I plume myself on knowing actors . YORICK : I could fly for joy . Come in ! Come in ! But Edmund , is it possible that seeing me mad with joy , thou dost not rejoice ? Rejoice with me , in Heaven 's name . I would have the whole world glad . " Wert thou the villain , thou ? " WALTON : Come ! Come ! We are losing time . YORICK : Yes , let us go and not lose time , since I have already lost my wits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going over the part with me . But I depend upon thee , too , boy . I must have thy help , thy counsel , thy criticism  --  ay ! Even thy derision when I go wrong . With two such masters , and Heywood in addition  --  and I am no fool . " Tremble , unfaithful woman ! Tremble , ingrate . " Oh ! Without question I shall do it divinely . I could dance like a child . WALTON : But thou dost not come . YORICK : Yes ! Yes ! I come . Exeunt . R. C. EDMUND : What to think ? What to believe ? Does Walton know my secret ? Did he speak without malice  --  without insinuation ? Oh ! This perpetual concealment ! This perpetual terror ! What hideous unrest in guilt ? Alice enters L. 2 E. goes to Edmund . ALICE : What is the matter , Edmund ? What has happened to thee ? What is it ? EDMUND : Thou , too ! Poor child , dost thou tremble , too ? ALICE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy one 's conscience without terror . EDMUND : And must we always live thus ? Tell me , in pity , is this life ? ALICE : Dost thou ask me ? It is possible to number the moments of a day , but not to count the pangs and agonies I suffer in a day . If any one looks at me , I say , " He knows it . " If any one accosts my husband , I say , " He is going to tell it him . " In every face I see a threat . The simplest word strikes like a menace on my heart . The light makes me afraid lest it reveal my evil conscience ; the dark frightens me ; in the night my guilt shows all the blacker . At times I seem to feel a brand of shame upon my face . It is as if I could touch it with my hand , and my mirror scarce can bid the stubborn illusion vanish . My strength forsakes me . My sore heart scarcely beats and the blessed hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dread to sleep lest I should dream of thee  --  lest thy name should escape my lips  --  lest I should say , " I love thee ! " And if  --  worn out with misery  --  I sleep at last , then am I more unhappy , for then the vague terror of the day takes on a hideous embodiment . And , again , the morning comes , and the bitterness of yesterday that seemed unsurpassable , and the bitterness of another morrow when it comes then surpasses that of today . Tears ? Groans ? There are no tears or groans of all I spend that bring relief to me . When thou comest to me , what anguish ? What unrest till thou art gone ? When thou goest , what agony ? What longing till thou art returned ? And when I speak to thee alone , as I speak now , my words seem to fill the world  --  world  --  the buzzing of a fly sends the blood to my heart . All ears seem to listen  --  all eyes to look  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And  --  Ah ! With a cry , falls . EDMUND , starting : What ? Speak ! ALICE : Nothing ! My shadow ! My shadow that seemed to me an accusing witness . And thou askest me if this is life ? What is it to be alive , Edmund ? No ! This is not life  --  it is perpetual death . EDMUND : Calm thyself , Alice . If thou wert guilty , thou wouldst think thyself less so . Sin never seems so foul as when virtue shines beside it . ALICE : Do not talk to me of virtue . In loving thee I violate all duties . I offend heaven and earth . Save me ! Save me ! As a strong man may save a weak woman . EDMUND : Oh ! Yes ! We must needs save each other . But how ? See  --  and not speak to thee ? Speak to thee , and not tell thee that I love thee ? Cease to love thee  --  having loved thee once ? What folly ! What madness ! I pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfil them  --  a thing to make the devil laugh . I do as everyone has done in such a case ; I dream of turning love into friendship . And love  --  striving to diminish itself  --  only grows the more . Love can not turn to friendship though it may turn to hate as fierce and deep . The thought of loving thee less than I love thee  --  affronts  --  infuriates me . Love thee to delirium , or abhor thee to frenzy . There is no middle course . Tell me  --  teach me  --  how shall I abhor thee ? ALICE : And I  --  I , too , pass whole days imagining means to overcome this passion that enslaves me . Sometimes I think if thou shouldst love some other woman all would be well , but when I think of thee beside some other woman , I tremble with hate . And there is no other pang that is not bliss to the agony I suffer . I kneel down to pray God that thou mayst forget me , and I find myself asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . I know my ingratitude to the best of men  --  I love thee ! I know my baseness  --  I love thee ! I bade thee save me . My safety is not loving thee  --  thou canst not save me . I love thee ! EDMUND : Alice ! My soul ! ALICE : Edmund . HEYWOOD , entering L. 2 . E. : Alice . ALICE : Oh ! Fly ! Fly ! HEYWOOD : Thank Heaven ! I find you alone . I came to look for you . EDMUND , suspiciously : For whom ? For me ? HEYWOOD : For thee and her . ALICE : Both ? HEYWOOD : Both . EDMUND , aside : Heavens ! ALICE , aside : My God ! HEYWOOD : Can I speak here without fear of being overheard ? EDMUND : Is what you have to say so secret ? HEYWOOD : So secret that I would that I myself might not hear it . EDMUND : Speak , but look to what you say . HEYWOOD : Look thou to what thou sayst . EDMUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen ! EDMUND : Oh ! Master ! HEYWOOD : Time was when I should have taken voluntarily this step to which necessity now forces me . I was a coward , cursed by the pitying weakness that makes a coward of an honest man . I hesitate no longer . Edmund , thou lovest this woman . EDMUND : I ! HEYWOOD : Alice ! Thou lovest this man . ALICE : Ah ! EDMUND : By what right do you accuse us ? HEYWOOD : By the right of a friend to the husband of Alice  --  the benefactor of Edmund . EDMUND : But if this is not true  --  if you have been deceived . ALICE : Oh ! Do not doubt it . You have been deceived . HEYWOOD : Hypocrisy and guilt are twin sisters . Come hither ! ( To Alice . ) Come hither ! ( To Edmund . ) Lift thy head , Edmund , and lift thou thine . Look each other in the face with the calm of innocence . Look ! Oh ! You were white a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wore the color of remorse . You wear the hue of shame . ALICE : Mercy , Master . EDMUND : Enough ! ALICE : We have struggled hard . EDMUND : I will tell you the truth . ALICE : Oh ! Yes ! He loves me  --  I love him . EDMUND : Be merciful  --  Master  --  be generous . ALICE : Have pity on two hapless wretches . EDMUND : Do not add to our misery . ALICE : Save us  --  defend us from ourselves . HEYWOOD : Courage  --  my children . ALICE : His children ! Didst thou hear him ? EDMUND : Oh ! Let us fall at your feet , Master ! ALICE : Yes ! HEYWOOD : You were better in my arms . EDMUND : Master ! ALICE : Can it be ! HEYWOOD : Come ! EDMUND : Save us . Throws himself into his arms . ALICE , same action : Save us for mercy 's sake ! HEYWOOD : Yes , I will save you with the help of God . ALICE : Edmund , Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived him . How blind is misery ! Oh , happiness ! I breathe again . Ay , Edmund , this is life . HEYWOOD : There is no time to lose . Speak . I must know all . Music tremolo . EDMUND : Alice came to our theatre two years ago . I saw her then for the first time . Oh ! If I had never seen her ! ALICE : Oh ! If we had never met . EDMUND : I saw her . I trembled  --  I loved her . ALICE : And I loved him . EDMUND : The days passed . I did not tell my love  --  impossible . ALICE : Yorick had already shown his regard for me . EDMUND : My rival was the man to whom I owed everything . ALICE : My mother fell sick ; we had no one to help us . Yorick seemed a friend sent by Heaven . " Alice , " my mother said to me one day , " wed Yorick ; he loves thee so much and is so kind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street to give me love and shelter and fortune and a place in the world . ALICE : Yorick crowned with peace my mother 's last days on earth . EDMUND : To have destroyed the happiness of such a man would have been villainy without parallel . ALICE : My mother besought me on her deathbed . EDMUND : I did what he who adds reverence to gratitude must do . ALICE : I answered as one must answer a dying mother 's prayers . EDMUND : I strove in my heart to forget her . ALICE : I strove to love him less and loved him more . EDMUND : The struggle was vain . ALICE : I said , " Edmund is Yorick 's son . " EDMUND : " Yorick is my father , " I said . ALICE : And when I marry Yorick , my love for Edmund will cease . EDMUND : And I believed that when she became Yorick 's wife my love for her would end . ALICE : At last the hour came . EDMUND : They were married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , instead of dying in our hearts  --  EDMUND : Rose mightier than ever , inexorable  --  resistless . ALICE : And yet , we did not speak . EDMUND : In spite of Yorick 's tears and prayers I refused to live under his roof . ALICE : We saw each other daily , and yet we did not speak . EDMUND : We passed whole hours together , yet we did not speak . ALICE : At last , one night , as we were playing Romeo and Juliet  --  EDMUND : Moved by the beautiful story  --  ALICE : Blent in passionate fire  --  the fire of truth  --  EDMUND : When all eyes were fixed upon us  --  ALICE : When all ears waited upon our words  --  EDMUND : Then , tongue  --  mind  --  heart  --  asked in the same low whisper , " Dost thou love me ? " ALICE : And tongue  --  mind  --  heart  --  responded faintly , " Yes . " EDMUND : That was our sin . ALICE : Our punishment has been to fear everyone  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comfort  --  none ! EDMUND : Refuge ! One  --  only  --  ALICE : Death ! EDMUND : And our sole crime is to have spoken . ALICE : We swear it . EDMUND : By Yorick 's life . ALICE : By his life . EDMUND : This is all . ALICE : All . EDMUND AND ALICE : All ! Stop music . HEYWOOD : Poor humanity ! Daunted by a molehill and ready to leap a mountain ! You love ! It is necessary that you should not love . ALICE : But in pity , tell me , what shall one do who loves and would not love ? HEYWOOD : Will not to love . EDMUND : To will is not enough . HEYWOOD : Enough  --  unless the will be feigned . ALICE : How can you be sure of that ? HEYWOOD : By an unimpeachable witness . EDMUND : What witness ? HEYWOOD : Your own conscience . If you were not responsible for your wrong , why these terrors  --  these tears  --  this remorse ? You must part with Alice forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . But we can not accomplish impossibilities . HEYWOOD : In the process of every crime there is a moment to recede or advance . ALICE : Edmund will obey you . With you for our protector , you will see how truth and strength will spring up in us again . EDMUND : Oh ! Yes ! With your help , Master , nothing will be impossible . HEYWOOD : I confide in the promise of a man and of a wife . EDMUND AND ALICE : Yes . HEYWOOD : Then , till the day comes that Edmund goes , never be alone together , never exchange a glance in the presence of others . Duty  --  necessity demands it . I had vainly fancied myself the sole possessor of your secret . I was a fool . Love can never be hidden . ALICE : What say you ? EDMUND : Speak ! HEYWOOD : This horrible secret is known to a man from whom some villainy is deeply to be feared . Music tremolo . EDMUND : What man ? HEYWOOD : On account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is furious against Yorick . EDMUND : Walton ! HEYWOOD : I know it from the author of the play , who came to me from Walton and repeated the talk they had had together . EDMUND : Alice ! We are lost  --  lost beyond all hopes . HEYWOOD : Not yet . I am going to look for him . You will have nothing to feat . EDMUND : Alice ! Alice ! ALICE : What is the matter ? Why are you so affected ? HEYWOOD : Courage , Edmund ! I will come again presently to calm your fears . EDMUND : For Heaven 's sake , do not leave us  --  do not go . HEYWOOD : Not go ? Wherefore ! EDMUND : Walton is not at home . HEYWOOD : How knowest thou this ? ALICE : Oh ! Save us from this horrible suspense . HEYWOOD : Where is the man ? EDMUND : Here . HEYWOOD : Heavens ! ALICE : With him ? EDMUND : With him . HEYWOOD : Thou hast seen him ? EDMUND : He began to disclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What shall we do ? What shall we do ? HEYWOOD : What a fatality ! ALICE : Do not abandon us  --  defend us . Save us , Master . EDMUND : In pity , find some way  --  some hope  --  HEYWOOD : Let us keep our wits about us  --  be calm  --  be quiet . Yorick enters at back with Walton . EDMUND : What have you decided ? ALICE : Tell us , Master . YORICK : " Tremble , thou faithless woman , tremble . " ALICE : Oh ! God ! Mercy  --  She faints . YORICK : Mercy ! She cried me mercy ! Why should she cry me mercy ? HEYWOOD : Seest thou not how delicate and slight she is ? YORICK : Oh ! Ay ! But mercy ! Why should she cry me mercy ? HEYWOOD : Startled by the sudden accusation . YORICK : Ay  --  so  --  but  --  mercy  --  WALTON : A singular accident ! YORICK : Mercy  --  mercy ! CURTAIN ACT II SCENE:Garden of Yorick 's house . Arbor in garden . Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part there , Gregory ? GREGORY : Ay ! Here ' t is ! But wilt thou set thyself in authority here , too , Mistress  --  in the arbor that these hands have built for Master Yorick 's more quiet study and better inspiration ? Away with thee and thy brooms and brushes ! Wilt thou put his table here , where the light strikes him full in the eyes ? An thou knewest how to read , thou'dst know thou couldst never read so . DOROTHY : And how should it be , good Gregory ? Prythee , teach me , and reproach me not . I am no scholar , that I know . GREGORY : Why , an thou wilt truly learn  --  look ! Yorick should sit so  --  with the part before him , on the table , thus . Then will the light fall over his shoulder , and strike the pages and he shall read you sweetly and smoothly by the hour , like any clock ticking . DOROTHY : Oh ! if thou wouldst but read a little of the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' T is not for young maids to hear . DOROTHY : Oh ! fie , Gregory ! Shall they not hear it in the theatre ! Sweet Gregory , read me a verse or two ! Thou canst not think how I do long to know this new tragical part of Master Yorick 's , and if ' t is not fit I hear it , all the more should I listen  --  and know how to shun such things hereafter . GREGORY : Well ! Well ! An thou wilt . There is a trick of holding the book this way or that  --  that I have well nigh forgotten . If you hold it in one fashion  --  you can read it like a clock , but if you hold it otherwise , you were as well dumb and blind . Wait ! There is another trick . If you hold it near , you can not see , and if you hold it afar off the wording is not plain , and between the two tricks  --  faith ! Stay , I will tell thee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilt not say it again to any living soul . DOROTHY : Nay , trust me . I will not breathe it till thou rememberest those two tricks of reading . GREGORY : Well ! Well ! say no more , then , and thou shall hear . Dost thou remember in that tragedy of Master Shakespeare 's where that pretty white maid of Venice is married to that blackamoor  --  I can not remember his name . DOROTHY : No matter for his name . That he was a blackamoor were quite enough for me . Ha ! I would rather wed an old man white , than the youngest blackamoor there ever was . GREGORY : He was both black and old  --  and this one in the new play is old . DOROTHY : Oh ! Then , truly ' t is not fit . GREGORY : Nay ! I will guard thy sensibilities against the worst . And then , when they go to that island  --  that island  --  I can never remember the name of that island . Where is it that the wine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oh ! Ay ! Cyprus  --  Cyprus ' t is . He ! he ! he ! Methought at first ' t was sack . But sack , quoth I , is a Spanish wine  --  and there is no island called sack , quoth I  --  and this wine of Venice is both wine and island , quoth I. So it ran in my mind and still I should not bethink me of  --  what saidst thou it was called ? DOROTHY : Cyprus ! GREGORY : Ay , Cyprus ' t is . Well ! And then he grows jealous of his young wife  --  DOROTHY : Prythee , good gaffer Gregory , is Master Yorick to have the part of Othello in the new play ? GREGORY : No ! DOROTHY : Then , thou silly dotard , why dost thou waste thy time and mine with talk of blackamoors and sack and islands ? Get thee to the marrow of the subject and leave mumbling these dry bones of argument . What is Yorick 's part in the new play ? GREGORY , flinging down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou hast learned to read . To me  --  gaffer ? To me , silly ? To me  --  dotard ? Walton enters L. 2 E. WALTON : Did she speak so of her master ? A saucy minion ! Where is he ? He sent for me hither . DOROTHY , going R. : I am sorry that Master Yorick should not know better how to choose his company . WALTON : Wilt thou answer me , baggage ? DOROTHY : Thou art answered , brute ! Exit R. WALTON : Cursed jade ! ( Sees manuscript . ) What is this litter under foot ? A sluttish careless wench ! GREGORY , picking up manuscript : ' T is Master Yorick 's part in the new play . WALTON : Ay , truly ! And what bower is this where I am sent to wait the new tragedian 's pleasures ? GREGORY : ' T is an arbor that my poor skill hath contrived for Master Yorick 's quiet study of his part . Doth it please thee , Master Walton ? WALTON : Excellently . And when Yorick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly study here together . Would I might come upon them here ! GREGORY : Ay ! ' T is a pretty sight , Master Walton , and one that ever delights my master . WALTON : He is lightly pleased . ' T is something he can have his fill of . Well ! Why dost thou stay ? GREGORY : I but stayed your bidding , Master Walton . WALTON : Get thee gone , then , and tell thy master that he keeps me waiting . Here , take thy master 's part . GREGORY : Ay ! I will take my master 's part against all the knaves in Christendom . Exit Gregory R. 2 . E. WALTON : He passes more than three hours with me at rehearsal , and then he comes to my house to look for me ! What can he want with me ? And I  --  what do I want with him ? The thing we hate attracts us like the thing we love . Tonight they give the new play . Tonight Yorick plays the part he has vilely robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him , ay , to encourage him in attempting impossible things  --  to play an inferior part beside him better than his own , this seemed the best means of assuring the keenest shame for him , the most satisfactory revenge for me . But now I fear I have erred . Everyone expects him to fail  --  except myself . Moreover , the vulgar applaud from habit . Yorick is their idol  --  even the fact of his exchanging the comic for the tragic mask will recommend him . And my enemies will not lose the occasion to injure me . Oh ! Fame ! My only hope and comfort , since my heart received the wound that will never be healed  --  thou comest with leaden feet ! Thou hast eagle wings for flight ! We suffer when we desire thee  --  more when we enjoy thee  --  more yet a thousand times when we lose thee ! How often does thy worshipper stifle in his heart the voice of honor and of truth ? When Yorick sought to wrong me , I resolved to strike him dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surest revenge is best , and there is no doubt but Yorick is jealous . He strives to hide it in his heart  --  but jealousy always mounts to the eye . Accident has done for me in part what I would have done , and this barbed suspicion once fixed in his soul , he can not rest till he puts his hand upon the truth . And who knows but the actor in his feigned jealousy may be inspired by the real jealousy of the man ! It lacks but this  --  that the misery of my enemy should recoil on my head . ( Enter Yorick . ) Ah ! Is it thou ? YORICK : Thou here ! WALTON : I knew thou wast at my house after rehearsal , and I came to see how I could serve thee . YORICK : It is true . I was there . I thank thee for thy courtesy . WALTON : Bah ! Between friends and comrades  --  What wilt thou ? YORICK : I merely wished  --  I will tell thee  --  WALTON , aside : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and I am half dead with fatigue . WALTON : Well , rest thee , then . YORICK : I thought to find relief in the open air of the fields , but I found none . WALTON : Thou art not well ? Thou art  --  YORICK : Restless  --  Ill  --  WALTON : Thou art heated . Methinks thou art feverish . YORICK : ' T is possible . WALTON : And why dost thou not send word to Heywood ? YORICK : Heywood ! Wherefore ? WALTON : Perhaps thou wilt not be able to play tonight ; perhaps the performance should be postponed . YORICK : ' T is not so bad as that . WALTON : Come , come . I will go to the Master myself , and  --  YORICK : I tell thee I will not see him . I tell thee I will play tonight . WALTON : But how canst thou hope for a triumph tonight , if  --  YORICK : A triumph ? Yes  --  a triumph ! Walton . WALTON : Well ! YORICK : Walton ! WALTON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not jest at me ! WALTON : By my faith ! I think thou art mad ! YORICK : I have a failing that I must correct . WALTON : Only one ? Happy thou . YORICK : I am a slave to curiosity . WALTON : Adam and Eve were the parents of mankind . YORICK : This morning thou wast speaking with Heywood in private at the theatre , and as I passed near by accident I heard thee say  --  WALTON : What ? YORICK , aside : He changes countenance . ( To Walton . ) I heard thee say , " I have not broken my promise . Yorick knows nothing from me . " WALTON : And what else didst thou hear ? YORICK : Only what I have told thee . WALTON : Well ! YORICK : And , as I am so curious , I long to know what thing it was Heywood made thee promise not to tell me . WALTON : On my word , thou art curious , indeed . YORICK : I began by confessing that . WALTON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WALTON : That of dreaming in broad day . YORICK : What dost thou mean ? WALTON : Thou thinkest thou hast heard me speak words that never passed my lips . YORICK : No ! WALTON : No . YORICK : This is sorcery . WALTON : If thou hast no other commands  --  YORICK , aside : I can not believe him . ( To Walton . ) Walton ! WALTON : Thou callest me ? YORICK : To wish thee joy . WALTON : Of what ? YORICK : Of lying very ill . WALTON : Neither ill nor well . I do not lie . YORICK : Thou liest . WALTON : Yorick ! YORICK : Thou liest ! WALTON : Art thou beside thyself ? YORICK : It seems not , since I see that thou hast lied . WALTON : I will give thee another proof of my regard by turning my back upon thee . Going . YORICK : Thou shalt not go till thou hast told me what thou didst promise to conceal . WALTON : Why , fool ! If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee ? YORICK : Ah ! Then I did not dream ! Then I did hear the words thou hast just denied ! WALTON : Leave me in peace ! Farewell ! YORICK : Walton , in pity  --  speak ! WALTON : Yorick , in pity , I will not speak . YORICK : Is it some misfortune that thou hidest from me ? WALTON : If thou couldst but know how foolish is thy persistence , and how generous my silence . YORICK : By my soul , thou shalt speak ! WALTON : By thy soul , I will not speak . YORICK : Speak ! WALTON : Ah ! No ! YORICK : No ! WALTON , coldly : No ! YORICK : I give thee an hour to think of it . WALTON : Dost thou threaten me ? YORICK : Ay , methinks . WALTON : Listen ! YORICK : Within an hour I will seek thee to know thy last decision . WALTON : And if thou dost not find  --  YORICK : I shall say thou art afraid . WALTON : Of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I will be here within an hour . YORICK : Thou wilt come ? WALTON : Be sure of it . YORICK : To tell me what thou dost now refuse ? WALTON : No . To see what thou wilt do when I refuse thee again . YORICK : ' T is ill playing with fire , Walton . Worse , a thousand times , to jest with the misery of a desperate man . WALTON : Art thou a desperate man ? YORICK : I know not . Leave me . WALTON : Farewell , then . Do we part friends ? YORICK : No  --  Yes . WALTON : Yes or no ? YORICK : No ! WALTON : Then I will not offer thee my hand . YORICK : We were friends for life . Didst thou change thy purpose ? WALTON : Within an hour , Yorick . YORICK : Walton , within an hour . ( Going  --  meets Edmund who enters L. 2 E. ) Good morrow , Edmund . EDMUND : Good morrow . WALTON , aside : Since he is resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to keep silence . Exit Walton L. 2 . E. YORICK : Ah ! Master Edmund ! By what miracle do I see thee here at last ? EDMUND : This morning you reproached me for not coming . YORICK : And thou art come because I reproached thee ? For that alone ? EDMUND : No  --  I meant to say  --  YORICK : Do not weary thyself in contriving an excuse . EDMUND : You seem preoccupied  --  disturbed . Doubtless the rehearsal of the play  --  YORICK : The rehearsal of the play  --  certainly  --  that is  --  EDMUND : As regards you  --  there is nothing to be feared . The public loves you blindly . Tonight it will recognize your talent as it always does , and  --  YORICK : What art thou saying ? Speak ! I hear thee . EDMUND , aside : He must know everything at last ; there is no help . YORICK : Thou dost not speak . EDMUND : Yes , sir , I was saying that the play tonight  --  YORICK : Thou hast not asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? EDMUND : Having seen her at rehearsal this morning  --  YORICK : Yes , it is true  --  EDMUND , aside : His doubts grow momently  --  they have reached their height ? YORICK : And the play tonight  --  EDMUND : It will please , I think . It has interest and movement ; the author is unknown , and therefore unenvied  --  YORICK : It shall not be . EDMUND : Oh ! YORICK : What ? Did I say anything ? Words escape me without my knowing . I am not well these days . EDMUND : You are ill ? What is the matter ? YORICK : A long and difficult part  --  the rehearsals  --  excessive study  --  But there is nothing serious . It will pass , it has passed . Let us talk here together awhile . ( Sits . ) We were talking of  --  What ? Ah ! Yes  --  of the new play . Thou wilt do thy part wonderfully well  --  and  --  Alice  --  How dost thou find her in the part of the disloyal wife ? EDMUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDMUND : Yes , sir , I think  --  YORICK : And thou seest how happy I am that thou  --  Edmund , come hither ! There is a furious tempest of the heart Whose lurid lightnings and whose thunder peals , Whose wild tornado blasts , the heart in vain Struggles to hide and hush . Yes , there is torment That from the stoutest and the bravest breast Can drag forth pitiful groans , and there is sorrow Whose burden is so great that if it find not Help in the heart of some compassionate friend , It grows intolerable . Edmund , methinks That thou shouldst be my friend . Even more than My son . EDMUND : Ah ! Yes ! I am thy son . YORICK : Love me a little then , my son , for I  --  I have dire need of some one 's love , now . Thou must know , Edmund , that Alice  --  Oh ! How my tongue shrinks from uttering the words that I abhor to hear even more than speak . She loves me not . EDMUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my misery . Could there be greater ? Ay . There can be greater , vaster than mind can measure . She loves another . EDMUND : But surely you deceive yourself . How do you know that your wife  --  Who has persuaded you to believe ? YORICK : Hearing one call her " faithless wife " in the words of that accursed play that seemed my own , she was so stricken that she swooned away . EDMUND : Is it strange ? She , being so delicate and sensitive that the lightest sudden noise startles and convulses her ? Did not Heywood say  --  YORICK : Ay ! He said so ! Alice , in her dismay , prayed for mercy . EDMUND : Startled by the sudden accusation her mind followed the impulse received like a blind machine . Did not Heywood tell you ? YORICK He told me that , also , in effect , It left a barb to rankle in my heart  --  A little barb that has waxed greater since , Till now , it is a red hot bolt ! Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The light of happiness dazzles like the sun , But the sweet Heaven of my bliss o'ercast , I saw , all things so vaguely fair before , Distinct and terrible within the shadow . Then I remembered tears untimely shed , Then I remembered groundless fears and terrors . I saw her younger , lovelier than ever , Myself grown suddenly hideous and old , And Alice seeks not to deceive or feign . The burden of her guilt palsies her will . She shows Such anguish when I chance to look upon her . She is so moved and stricken that I marvel If my regard have supernatural power To pierce her inmost soul . Her trembling lips Betray the tumult of her conscience . When She speaks to me , sometimes , rebellious tears Spring to her eyes and tremble ' neath the lids That vainly struggle to imprison them . It wrings my heart . And if she ever laugh , Her laughter is sadder than her tears to me . Yes , I would swear it before God in Heaven Alice is hiding in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I have learned To know it with such terror as the wretch Should feel who saw the blue Heaven rent asunder And in the rift the lurid fires of Hell . Who is the thief that robbed me of my peace ? Who is the thief that stole her innocence ? Speak ! Do not tell me that thou dost not know . ' T were idle ! I would not believe thee ! Speak ! Thou dost not speak ! Thou wilt not speak ! My God , Is all the world in league with guilt against me ? EDMUND : To see you suffer such bitter anguish leaves me almost powerless to open my lips . But I repeat that your suspicions are unfounded , that I know nothing . YORICK : Why hast thou ever been so disdainful of Alice ? Because thou knewest she had betrayed thy more than friend , because thou wouldst not countenance with thy presence thy benefactor 's shame . EDMUND : Oh ! Do not believe it ! It is a hideous illusion . YORICK : I tell thee that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dost thou know my rival ? EDMUND : Your rival does not exist . Alice is guiltless . YORICK : I will solve my doubts this instant . I am going to know whether she is guilty or no ! EDMUND : What do you mean ? YORICK : Nothing ! The most natural thing in the world  --  to ask her the question . EDMUND : No ! No ! In mercy , no ! YORICK : And wherefore no ? Can I do less than trust her word ? EDMUND : But , if you accuse her without cause ? If she be innocent ? YORICK : If she be innocent ! Why should she tremble ? Why should I tremble ? Why shouldst thou tremble ? EDMUND : Time will solve all your doubts . YORICK : Ah ! Time , that seems to fly so swiftly , pauses at terrible moments , and appalls the soul with the image of an eternity of pain . For some days past , time has stood still with me . I would fain live again . EDMUND : Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Not a day more  --  not an hour more . Not an instant more  --  off ! EDMUND : Oh ! Consider what you are doing . YORICK : The boy is stubborn . EDMUND : Listen . YORICK : And a fool to boot ! Away ! EDMUND : Oh ! Oh ! YORICK : There is no help ! I must know all . EDMUND : Mercy . YORICK : As if I would not have mercy . Exit into House R. Enter Alice by window . EDMUND , seeing her : Oh ! Heavens ! Didst thou hear ? ALICE : Yes . EDMUND : Tomorrow a ship sails at daybreak . The captain is our friend . Let us escape . ALICE : No ! EDMUND : By night everything could be ready for our flight ALICE : No ! EDMUND : If there be no other means to reach thee , thou wilt receive a letter tonight at the theatre telling thee what I have done and what we have both to do . ALICE : No ! EDMUND : Thy husband will soon know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDMUND : And what will become of thee ? ALICE : Why should I care ? EDMUND : And what will become of us both ? ALICE : Fly thou . EDMUND : Alone ! Never ! ALICE : Fly ! EDMUND : With thee ? ALICE : No  --  no  --  a thousand times ! No ! YORICK , without : Alice ! Alice ! EDMUND : Dost thou hear ? Already thou art faint and breathless . ALICE : He is looking for me . EDMUND : To ask thee if thou art guilty . What wilt thou say ? ALICE : What will I say ? " Yes . " EDMUND : And then ? ALICE : And then ? Oh ! Dost thou think he will kill me ? EDMUND : His fury , or thine own anguish will be thy death . ALICE : Oh ! Rapture ! EDMUND : Thou seekest not thy death alone  --  but mine as well . ALICE : Thine ! YORICK , without : Alice ! EDMUND : He comes . ALICE : I will be silent . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do not fear  --  I can be more despicable . YORICK , nearer : Alice ! ALICE : Here ! I am here ! Enter Yorick . YORICK : Ah ! ALICE : You were looking for me , and I for you , and it seems we were running from each other . YORICK , aside to Edmund : I wish to speak with Alice alone for a moment . Wait for me in my room . EDMUND , aside : At least , I shall be at hand . Exit R. 3 . C. YORICK : Come hither , Alice ! Nearer , Alice ! Sit here beside me . Art thou afraid of me ? ALICE , sitting : Afraid ? Wherefore ? What do you wish with me ? YORICK , aside : She tranquil ! I perturbed ! ( To Alice . ) Alice , there is a guilty conscience here . Is it thine or mine ? ALICE : A guilty conscience ? Thine  --  or  --  YORICK Alice ! Men commonly awake to love In the fast dawn of youth , and recklessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and involve themselves In passion after passion  --  foul or futile . Leaving along life 's thorny labyrinth Bits of their hearts on every briar . My heart Was whole and virgin when I saw and loved thee . And , oh , how potent is the sore felt first , In the autumnal years to which can come No second love . Thus , Alice , I have loved thee ! Dost thou love me as thou shouldst love me ? Speak ! ALICE : Oh ! Surely , I owe you so much for the benefits  --  YORICK : Benefits ? Who spake of benefits ? Dost thou love me ? ALICE : Love you ? Am I not your wife ? YORICK : Dost thou love me ? ALICE : Yes , sir . Yes , I love you . YORICK : In very truth ? Yes ? Shall I believe it ? For God 's sake , tell me the truth . Dost thou love none but me ? None ? ALICE : What is it you ask me ? YORICK : Dost thou love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , I fear , thou art deceiving me . Perchance thou lov'st another  --  and hast not Yet told thy love . Alice , if this be true , Fear not to own thy secret before me . Humbly will I accept the penalty Of taking for my wife a child who might Have been my daughter . Tenderly , like a father , Not harshly like a husband will I listen To thy confession . I will make thee see The difference between the adulterous love That makes Hell laugh  --  and that pure wedded love For which Heaven keeps its crown and palms . For thee , I will redouble all my arts and worship , And I will never cease to supplicate Thy guardian angel that he hold thee safe Within his hand . And do not doubt , my love , Alice , my soul , but I shall yet prevail Against my rival , and shall win thy heart And lead thee once again into the path Of duty and happiness . For thou art good , Thy heart is noble and generous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Thou hadst seen the ugliness of sin Must fly it in horror , and when thou hadst known All my tenderness  --  Oh ! Believe me , child , Some little love is surely due to him Who loves thee so much . ALICE , aside : The air chokes me . If I could die  --  YORICK Thou answerest nothing ! Thou art silent still ! Thou lovest another , and thy love is known ! As little shouldst thou hide it from me , then , For well thou knowest that so black a sin Could not remain unpunished . Sully thy name ! And drag thy husband 's honor through the mire ! And if that husband 's only care had been To save his wife from every slightest sorrow His very happiness in adoring her , And if he had no life but hers , no hope Of Heaven but in her love and , losing that , Only despair and death . And if she knew All this , and doomed him to the pangs of Hell In this world and the next , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though as proved As Holy Writ , it needs must seem a lie Incredible ! I will not think that thou  --  Such treachery with me  --  that thou has been  --  No ! No ! I do not  --  can not  --  will not think it . Kneeling ? Were she innocent she would not kneel ! Infamous woman ! Then I have not been deceived ! What is it ? What ? What hast thou ? Speak ! Weep ! Art thou dying ? Oh ! What 's to me whether she die or live ? Her suffering may be feigned . All is deceit , and vileness in her ! Nay , the woman knows not even the name of truth . ALICE : Oh ! Falls forward on floor . YORICK , raising her : Alice , calm thyself ! Tomorrow we shall see what 's to be done ! Today we must think of other things . The play tonight . Alice , for God 's sake , rouse thyself . ( Heywood appears . ) Ha ! Who is it ? Who is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind thou didst not know me ? YORICK : Thou ? HEYWOOD : Rise , Alice . YORICK : Do not touch her . HEYWOOD , lifting Alice : Twice thou hast taken this fancy for tragedy . Thou art grown insufferable . YORICK : Did I not bid thee touch her not ? HEYWOOD : Stand aside . YORICK : Am I dreaming ? HEYWOOD : I would swear thou wert , or else drunk or mad . Come to thy chamber , Alice . YORICK : What ! Thou ! HEYWOOD : Wait a moment ! I would speak with thee . YORICK : I tell thee , Alice must not leave me . HEYWOOD : I tell thee to wait a little . Exit with Alice . YORICK : What is it ? Has the reality of my life turned to some fantastic dream whose end can not be foreseen ? Am I the sport of some black sorcery ? Heywood ! Yes ! There is no doubt ! No ! Impossible ! What misery to live forever in this darkness ! Light ! Light ! Eternal Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will part them . Going . Enter Walton L. WALTON : The hour is passed and here I am . YORICK : Oh ! Walton ! Welcome Walton ! Thrice welcome ! This is surely keeping one 's promise . WALTON : I always keep my promises . YORICK : And thou art come to tell me thou wilt not satisfy my curiosity ! WALTON : Precisely . YORICK : Since I threatened thee , thou wilt show me that thou dost not fear me ! WALTON : Even so . YORICK : Why , I like that . There shall be no quarrel between us . Away with these punctilios . WALTON : As thou wilt . But , in good faith , I had not hoped to find thee so reasonable . YORICK : Ay , there is no need that thou shouldst tell me anything . On the contrary , I have an amusing story for thee . WALTON : For me ? YORICK : There was once a youngster  --  all vehemence  --  all fire . He fell furiously in love with a lady nearly twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts . ) His love was returned . What rapture ! They were married , bliss beyond measure ! WALTON : Wilt thou cease ? YORICK : These loving turtles had passed the honeymoon in peace , when one night the youngster returning home unexpectedly found his wife  --  WALTON : It is false , it is a lie . YORICK : Found his wife in the arms of another . WALTON : I swear to Heaven . YORICK : Oh ! He swore to Heaven , too , and fancy what he must have said when he found that this man , a gentleman of lofty lineage , was an old lover , with whom she had often sinned . WALTON : It is a lie  --  peace ! YORICK : He resolved to take vengeance on his wife , and his wife disappeared as if by magic . WALTON : Wilt thou be silent ? YORICK : He resolved to take vengeance on the lover , and the lover had him well cudgelled by his lackeys . WALTON : Wilt thou cease ! YORICK : Wilt thou begin ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Well , thou must know that twenty years after , the cudgelled husband under another name and far from the scene of the event , which he believed buried in oblivion  --  But , look you , he deceived himself . He was known to bear a false name that he might hide the dishonor of his own . WALTON : What art thou doing , Yorick ? YORICK : And there were not wanting those who pointed their fingers at him . WALTON : Oh ! Fury ! YORICK : And when they saw him pass , cried , " There goes a poltroon ! " For the outraged husband who does not avenge himself is infamous . WALTON : Then who more infamous than thou . YORICK : Ah ! Ha ! At last , thou wilt speak ! WALTON : I , at least , discovered the intrigue ! YORICK : Speak . WALTON : I , at least , tried to avenge myself . YORICK : And I ? Speak ! And I ? WALTON : Thou art blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace with thy dishonor . YORICK : Speak . WALTON : Thy wife  --  YORICK : My wife ! Speak ! Nay , cease ! Why heaven ! I 'll tear thy tongue from thy throat ! WALTON : Ah ! Thou seest now . Thou art more infamous than I. YORICK : My wife ? WALTON : Has betrayed thee ! YORICK : Betrayed me ! Prove it ! Give me silent proof proof  --  clearer than the sun in heaven ! Thou dost not launch this terrible accusal without the power to make it good by proofs ; then give me them . Why dost thou delay ? Thou shouldst have them . Thou hast them not . I knew it . This man tells me that an angel is a devil , and expects me to believe it on his word . WALTON : I say that Alice is unfaithful to thee . YORICK : And I say that thou must prove it . And , if thou dost not prove it now , upon this instant , confess that thou hast lied . Say that Alice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Say that the world reveres her and worships her . Say that the heavens rejoice to look down upon her . Say it ! If thou wilt not  --  WALTON : I say that Alice has a lover . YORICK : Thou sayst it ? WALTON : Yes . YORICK : And provest it not ? Villain ! Thou shalt never say it more . Seizes him . Enter Heywood , Alice , and Edmund . WALTON : Yorick ! HEYWOOD : My friend ! YORICK : I have no friend . EDMUND : My father ! YORICK : I have no son . ALICE : My husband ! YORICK : My God ! I have no wife . Rushes out . TABLEAU CURTAIN ACT III SCENE I SCENE : Green room of the theatre . Large table , with cover  --  two small mirrors . Two cornices from which hang ample curtains that touch the ground . Chair C. Door on R. Woodford and Thomas enter at rise . THOMAS : There ought to be some water here for Mistress Alice . WOODFORD : Yes  --  in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WOODFORD , drinks : Ah ! I breathe again ! I had my heart all doubled up in a knot . I thought they were going to  --  So many emotions  --  such joy  --  Oof  --  ( Takes a paper from table and fans himself . ) Well ! Master Thomas ! What think you of my play , now ? THOMAS : What do I think ? Come . Mighty pretty ! And this last act in my opinion is going to please as much as the others . WOODFORD : Certainly . If one were at all vain , some men in my place would fancy that they rivalled Shakespeare . I do not . Out of sheer modesty , I go about doing him homage . But poor soul , I pity him tonight , for he must feel that the new author is bearding him . But how can it be helped ! He can not expect to be always the first . Enter Edmund as Manfredo . R. EDMUND : Tell me , Thomas ! Does Mistress Alice come off before I go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am on the stage till the end ? THOMAS : Did you not know it ? EDMUND , aside : The play over , it will be impossible to reach her . What a fatality ! Going . WOODFORD : Master Edmund , in that challenge scene  --  to tell the truth  --  I thought you  --  well ! You were better at the rehearsal ! Ah ! EDMUND : Yes , sir ! Yes ! Exit absent-mindedly . WOODFORD : He scarcely deigned to answer me . I rack my brains making plays like this in order that an impertinent little actor  --  Enter Walton as Landolfo . WALTON , to Thomas : Edmund has just gone ? THOMAS : Yes , sir ! WALTON : What did he want ? THOMAS : Nothing ! To know when Mistress Alice came off . WOODFORD : Master Walton , do you not think that Edmund is playing pretty badly tonight ? THOMAS : Something must have happened to him . WOODFORD : Twice , when I went to his room I found him talking with Dervil in a low voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their conversation . Actors should not be allowed to receive visitors behind the scenes . WALTON : And this Dervil  --  who is he ? WOODFORD : The captain of a ship that sails tomorrow . THOMAS : As soon as the captain went away , Edmund asked me for ink and wrote a letter . WOODFORD : Writing letters during the representation of a play ! WALTON , aside : A letter ! A ship that sails tomorrow ! THOMAS : And talking of letters , here is this one you are to take with you on the stage and give to Count Octavio . Gives letter . WALTON : Well ! Puts letter in pocket of dress . Applause heard without . WOODFORD : What 's that ? Whom is that for ? THOMAS : Whom ? Whom else but Yorick ! Running out R. WOODFORD : How that man is playing tonight ! Why , when they told me he was to do the Count , I was ready to dash my head against the wall . But so it goes . Who would have imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Why , he has left all the actors in the world behind him . Why , he does better than thou . WALTON : Really ! WOODFORD : Much better ! WALTON : And if that is your opinion , does it seem civil or prudent to tell it me , face to face ? WOODFORD : Pardon , I thought  --  the glory of a fellow actor . WALTON : You are a fool ! WOODFORD : How ? What ! A fool ? I  --  Enter Thomas . THOMAS : It was just as I said  --  the applause was for Yorick . WOODFORD , aside : Walton is consumed with envy . ( Aloud . ) Bravo ! Yorick ! Bravo ! ( Aside . ) Digest that , you sour-stomached ruffian ! Exit R. THOMAS : And what think you of Yorick ? WALTON : Thou art a good boy , Thomas . Look well to thy duty , and I will make Heywood increase thy wages . THOMAS : Oh ! If I do not ! I will be greatly beholden to you . WALTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOMAS : Yes , sir ! WALTON : Well , and what thinkest thou ? THOMAS : I ? WALTON : Yes , tell me ! This morning thou saidst he would do very badly . THOMAS : How often I said so ! WALTON : And now thou thinkest ? THOMAS : I do not think ; I am sure . WALTON : What ? THOMAS : That I talked nonsense . WALTON : Ah ! THOMAS : He has played us all a fine trick . In the first act , you know  --  he was  --  well  --  somewhat embarrassed , but he soon  --  ay , faith  --  he came mighty well out of some scenes even then ! I stood there gaping and staring at him till I forgot to call Mistress Alice , and if the author had not given me a good pinch to bring me to my senses , the play would have ended there . Look you , Master Walton ! When I saw you play Macbeth , I thought that nothing could be better , but now  --  WALTON : Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  THOMAS , startled and looking at manuscript : Eh ! No ! This scene is very long . We may be sure after this that as long as Yorick is in the company no one else will have the first parts . Who could rival him in them ? WALTON : Faith ! Thou art a chatterer . THOMAS : Enthusiasm was always a great talker , and I am enthusiastic for Yorick . Everyone is ! The principal actors grumble under their breath , but it is envy , pure envy . WALTON : Wilt thou leave me in peace ? THOMAS , aside : What a gesture ! What a look ! Oh ! What a fool I am ! Hold thy tongue , my good friend Thomas . WALTON : What art thou muttering ? THOMAS : Nay , I did not mutter  --  on the contrary . WALTON : Away with thee , or I swear  --  THOMAS : Going  --  going  --  ( Walton turns away . ) Rage  --  rage  --  and eat thy bitter heart ! Exit Thomas . WALTON , alone : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What a glory ! Greater than mine ! A thousand times greater ! If I could not pardon him the injury he did me before , how can I pardon him this ? I will have revenge  --  equal to the offense  --  revenge ! ( Shouts without . ) More applause ! ( Goes to door . ) Ah ! For Alice ! She 's coming off ! Edmund is going on by the same side ! They exchange glances ! Yes ! without question , the act was quick as thought , but I saw it . Edmund gave her something as he passed . What could it be ? Perhaps that letter  --  the proof that Yorick demands . If it were only a letter . If fate should favor me ! Hither she comes ! Ah ! Hides behind the curtains . Enter Alice . Looks around , closes door  --  then goes to dressing table and opens paper . WALTON , aside : Yes , it is Edmund 's letter . ALICE , reads letter : " ' Till now I did not know with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . At five in the morning I will await thee in the street . We will never part  --  my love will last my life . Fly with me  --  there is no other hope  --  Fly , Alice ! My soul  --  and  --  " Fly ? Abandon my unhappy husband ? Make my wrong irremediable ? An eternal shame ? Never ! Death were better . ( Puts letter to flame . Walton seizes her arm . ) Oh ! ( She changes letter to other hand . ) Walton ! WALTON : Ay  --  Walton ! ALICE : Where were you ? WALTON : Behind the curtains . ALICE : What is your purpose here ? WALTON : I want Edmund 's letter which you hold in your hand there . ALICE : Mercy ! WALTON : Give it me ! ALICE : Do not come near me ! WALTON : Why should I not ? ALICE : I will cry out . WALTON : Oh ! Very well ! That will serve my purpose even better . ALICE : Oh ! What is your purpose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray him to my husband ? WALTON : Perchance . ALICE : Tonight ? Here ? During the play ? But that were infamous  --  base beyond example . There is no name for such a horrible deed . Oh , be mericful  --  a little mercy  --  for him  --  for him alone  --  I implore you . Whom do you love ? What words will soonest touch your heart ? Tell me what I must do to move you ? WALTON : You can do nothing . I must be revenged . ALICE : And why should you not be revenged ? But must you be revenged tonight ? Tomorrow I will give you the paper I crush in my hand  --  believe me  --  I swear it . Tomorrow my husband shall know the truth . You shall be present . You shall slake your thirst of vengeance with his agony and mine . It will not vex you then to have waited till tomorrow . Leave me . You will grant the favor that I ask ! You will grant it , will you not ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WALTON : No ! And a thousand times No ! ALICE : Ah ! I took him for a man and he is a demon . WALTON : I am a man , a man with a wrong to be revenged . ALICE : Oh ! Sees Yorick , who enters . YORICK , seeing Walton : Thou here ! ' T were better we did not meet tonight except upon the stage . WALTON : Truly , thou art right but when thou knowest what has happened  --  YORICK : No matter . Tonight we belong to the public . Go ! WALTON : Is the greed of glory so great in thee that thou has forgotten all else ? YORICK : Greed for glory ? Prythee ! Go ! WALTON : As thou didst once ask me for a certain proof  --  YORICK : Proof ? What sayest thou ? ALICE , aside : Can this be reality ? YORICK : See ! She is here ! Beware thou dost not slander her . Where is it ? In her presence . Proof ! WALTON : Bid thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed him . YORICK : Go ! Leave us ! WALTON : In one of her hands she holds a paper . ALICE : He is a villain . YORICK : A paper ? Go . WALTON : That paper is a letter from her lover . ALICE : Ah ! Crushing paper . YORICK : Give me that letter , Alice . ALICE : It is not a letter . Did he say it was a letter ? He lied . Do not believe him . YORICK : He accuses thee . Thou mayst refute the slanderer . Do so . ALICE : It is  --  I will tell thee  --  this letter . YORICK : I must see it . ALICE : It is impossible . YORICK : Impossible ! Give it me . ALICE : Ah ! Starts towards door . YORICK : Wouldst thou make my dishonor public ? ALICE : Pity me , thou mother of the friendless ! WALTON : Resistance is useless . You had better yield at once . Knocking at door . THOMAS , without : Yorick ! YORICK : You hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stage . ALICE : Go  --  go  --  for Heaven 's sake . THOMAS , without : Yorick ! YORICK : Do not force me to use violence with a woman . THOMAS , without : Yorick , you are keeping the scene waiting . YORICK : Dost thou not hear them ? ALICE : I shall go mad . YORICK : Dost thou despise my threats ? WOODFORD , without : Open  --  Open  --  The stage is all prepared . YORICK : Oh ! I must put an end to this . ALICE : Mercy ! Mercy ! YORICK : The letter ! The letter ! ALICE : Have pity on me . HEYWOOD , without : Will you open here , I say ! ALICE : Master , master ! YORICK : The letter ! ALICE : No ! My life first . ( Walton seizes letter . ) Ah ! WALTON : Here it is ! YORICK : Give it me . THOMAS , without : Yorick ! Yorick ! YORICK : You will not ? ALICE : What does he say ? Doors burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Walton ! WOODFORD : You have ruined me . THOMAS : The stage has been waiting two minutes . YORICK : Will you give me that letter ? WALTON : I have told you not now . WOODFORD : What are you doing ? ( Shouts outside . ) Do n't you hear ? THOMAS , prompting Yorick : " Heaven help me at last . And now I burst the prism of my doubt . " YORICK : Oh ! I am not an actor now . I am a man His name ! At least his name . WALTON : Presently . HEYWOOD : The public is waiting , Yorick . THOMAS : The public is furious . WOODFORD : Oh , my poor play ! YORICK : That letter ! Wilt thou give it me ? WALTON : It shall not leave my hands except for thine . WOODFORD : Come ! THOMAS : " Heaven help me at last . " HEYWOOD : Duty before everything . YORICK : A curse upon duty  --  a curse upon me ! Exit . THOMAS , to Alice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Edmund . WOODFORD : And she wo n't go either . ALICE , as before : If my husband sees it  --  HEYWOOD : He shall not see it . WOODFORD : Madam ! ALICE , to Woodford : Support me ! Lead me  --  WOODFORD : Willingly , Madam . Lean on me . I shall go like Atlas bearing up the world , or the envy of the world . We are come now to the point that Shakespeare chiefly praised . If you could imagine that you were really betraying your husband  --  WALTON : Do not fear , master poet ! She will play your false wife to the life . WOODFORD : Doubtless ! Rest on me , Madam . Faith , ' t is a play that seems to prosper both before and behind the scenes . Players and spectators all are alike frenzied by it . ALICE : Merciful Heaven ! Can I endure ? WOODFORD : Madam , you must . Else my play is ruined . Exeunt R. THOMAS , to Walton : Did I hand you the letter you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOMAS : I do n't know whether I am standing on my head or on my feet . Exit . HEYWOOD : Walton , that paper does not belong to thee . WALTON : Nor to thee . HEYWOOD : The owner has charged me to reclaim it from thee . WALTON : Let me see , then , how thou wilt reclaim it . HEYWOOD : How ? ( Restrains himself . ) Walton ! Brave and generous hearts feel only compassion for the misfortunes of others . Have pity on Yorick ! Have pity on Alice ! Save her , if it be possible . Her fault is not so grave as thou thinkest  --  and can be easily repaired . Let us destroy that paper . WALTON : Yorick has wronged me . HEYWOOD : Yorick has wronged thee ? Then take thy revenge , but take it nobly . Thou canst not heal thy honor by committing a villainy . If Alice has offended thee in nothing , why shouldst thou make her the victim of thy resentment ? To wound , at the same stroke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage or a madman . And even if this unhappy woman had done thee wrong , thou couldst not avenge thyself on her without cowardice . Men avenge themselves on men  --  not on women . WALTON : Ask me whatever you will , so you do not ask me for that letter . HEYWOOD : Do not think me ignorant of the cause of thy hate for Yorick . Thou hatest him not because he has wronged thee , but because thou enviest him . WALTON : What ! Darest thou say ? HEYWOOD : I have called thee villain and coward  --  thou art worse yet  --  thou art envious . WALTON : I ! Envious ? Nothing could pain me so much as that ! HEYWOOD : Because thou most deservest it . Yes ! Envy holds thy soul within its clutch . Envy that laughs at others ' evil and bewails their good ! Envy is the most pitiable of afflictions  --  if it were not the most repulsive of vices . Envy ! The shame and dishonor of the mind ! the leprosy of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As thou saidst to Yorick , " duty before everything . " HEYWOOD : They are applauding him . Hear them . Dost thou tremble to hear them ? There is no sound in the world so deadly to the envious soul as the applause a rival wins . Enter Woodford , jubilant . WOODFORD : Hurrah ! Hurrah ! The public is ours again ! The verses certainly are not bad , but then how Yorick spoke them ! What gestures ! What intonation ! ( Shouts . ) More applause  --  more  --  admirable ! divine ! Clapping his hands . WALTON , starting to go : I shall be late if you keep me here . HEYWOOD , interposing : Give me the letter . WOODFORD : What is the matter with everyone tonight ? Is Master Heywood gone mad , too ? This is the error of writing too forcibly . Enter Thomas . THOMAS , to Walton : Come , you are to go on in a minute . WOODFORD : Oh well , then , lose no time . Have you got the letter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it . WOODFORD : No  --  no  --  you must not keep it ! You are mad . You must give the letter to Master Yorick . WALTON : Never fear . Yorick shall duly have the letter . ( To Thomas . ) Go ! I am coming . HEYWOOD : Stop , I say ! I will tear it from thee with thy life if needs must . WOODFORD : Tear the letter from him ? Oh , merciful heavens ! Heywood is as mad as all his players , and he is n't in the piece either . But , here alone , I will appeal to Shakespeare himself . WALTON , with sudden resolution : Ah ! HEYWOOD : Well ! WOODFORD : Only five verses more . WALTON : Duty is stronger than will  --  Take it . Gives wrong letter . HEYWOOD , taking letter : At last ! Exit Walton . WOODFORD , urging him : Run ! THOMAS , prompting him : " My Lord , behold me here . " Exeunt all but Heywood . HEYWOOD , opens letter : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to give Yorick in the play ! And the other ! Great heavens ! He is already on the stage . Rushes off . CURTAIN SCENE LAST SCENE : Magnificent hall in the palace of Count Octavio . Yorick as Octavio , Edmund as Manfredo , Alice as Beatrice , Walton as Landolfo , discovered . The Prompter in his place . The Count and Landolfo speak together without being heard by Beatrice and Manfredo who are at the back of the stage , their attitudes and faces betraying dismay and sorrow . YORICK As Count . " Landolfo , though a deep anxiety Preyed on my mind when thou wert absent , yet , Thy presence causes me still greater sorrow . Prythee , if thou hast that letter still Give it me now , and end at least my doubts . " LANDOLFO , giving him Edmund 's letter : " Take it ! " COUNT : " Oh ! " LANDOLFO : " I am avenged . " COUNT : " Go , Landolfo ! " Landolfo bows and retires , looking back at Yorick with malicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone : " Manfredo ! " EDMUND , as Manfredo : " Beatrice ! " BEATRICE : " The hour has come . " COUNT " Now I shall know at least thy lover 's name . Tremble , faithless woman ! Tremble , ingrate , Who has robbed me of my honor and my peace . Vain all thy cunning , for here stands revealed Thy guilt . " Opens letter . " My blood is frozen in my veins . Here let it burn like fire ! Woe to the wretch For whose vile sake thou bringest this shame upon me . " Fixes his eyes on paper  --  starts violently . How ! What ! Overwhelmed with amazement , he speaks in his own voice , forgetting play . Edmund and Alice look in dismay . PROMPTER : " Oh ! What do I behold ? " YORICK : What is this ? PROMPTER : " What do I behold ? " YORICK : Ah ! Merciful God ! ( Falls into chair  --  after a pause , starts up . ) " Here there is no escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Alice and Edmund approach . Drops again into chair  --  and stares at table  --  and then . ) Look ! Shows letter . EDMUND AND ALICE : Oh ! Shrinking back . YORICK : " Oh , that the earth might swallow us up . " ( Drops again into chair  --  and stares at table  --  and then , with desperate effort , flings himself threateningly towards Edmund  --  checks himself  --  looks at the audience , giving them to understand the tumult of emotion in his soul  --  turns his eyes away . They fall on Alice . He rushes towards her  --  again checks himself  --  goes up stage  --  pressing hands to forehead and heart alternately . ) " Oh , that the earth might swallow us up . " Edmund and Alice in terror . PROMPTER : " Wert thou the villain  --  them ? " ( Pauses , and repeats . ) " Wert thou the villain  --  thou ? " YORICK , yielding to the circumstances and unable to master his fury , makes the situation of the play his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person he represents . From this point the dramatic fiction merges into reality and Alice , Edmund and Yorick lose themselves in its character : Why , what accursed coil is this , thou knave ? Thou mock'st me with a mimic misery . So apt with that which eats into my soul That I could well believe your Poet made My wretchedness the mirror of his art . His words spring to my lips . They speak my hate , My fury , my despair . Thou painted Count ! Thou poor , unreal thing ! Thou effigy ! Yorick and thou art one in wretchedness ! Let us be one in language  --  and speak thou For me , that else were speechless in amaze Before this devil 's miracle of falsehood . I make thy griefs my own , and from this point I 'll be no longer Yorick but Octavio ! And , oh , let them beware whose guilt has turned This shadow of sorrow into living shame , When Yorick and Octavio unite to right this wrong . Now , prompter , what was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou ? " YORICK : Ay ! well  --  " Wert thou the villain  --  thou ? The faithless wretch , The infamous seducer , thou , whose hand Could strike his benefactor to the heart ? And art thou then the thief That robbed me of my wife ? And wert thou he That put this mark of shame upon my brow ? To make me , while I live , a mock of men , A hissing and a by-word ? My God ! Is this the recompense he earns Who pities and who loves the friendless ? No ! On the betrayer fall the dishonor and the disgrace . To the betrayed be all respect . " EDMUND Oh ! Father ! YORICK " Do I dream ? Thy father , I ? Then , may a father 's curse Be the more on such a son as thou . " EDMUND Oh ! No ! No ! What hast thou said ? YORICK To Alice . " And thou . Unhappy woman ! What shall I say to thee ? Thou standest there so breathless and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That I could swear thou wert carved out of marble , But that I hear the violent palpitation With which thy heart responds to mine . Oh ! Where is the light , that , in a fatal hour , Shone on me from those beauteaus eyes of thine , Whose timorous softness shamed the evening star ? Where is that face divine , wherein , together , The red rose and the orange blossom glowed . I saw thee  --  would I had never seen thee  --  When sad and wayworn , I drew near the bounds Of middle life and unto me thou wast A ray of sunshine from a clouded heaven ! My sadness turned to rapture ! I adored thee With all my soul  --  as men look up to angels . Now I can see that thou wert false as fair , And I can hate thee ! No ! I do not know Whether I hate or love thee  --  Woe to thee ! For love turned madness knows not how to pardon And if thou wouldst I should not strike thee dead , Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame . " ALICE " O ! Mercy ! " YORICK " In vain thou criest me mercy  --  Thou shalt have none . " EDMUND " And yet she merits it . " YORICK " Not she nor thou . " ALICE " My life belongs to thee ! Oh ! Have a little pity  --  Kill me quickly ! " EDMUND " I alone wronged thee and on me alone Let your wrath fall . " YORICK " The guilt belongs to both . And both of you shall render me account ! " EDMUND " She , too ? And will you kill her with your hand ? " YORICK " Fool ! For such a guilt as hers , could I do less Than kill her ? " ALICE " Ay , let him , and make an end . My blood can give him back his name unstained . My blood alone can wash away his shame . " YORICK Oh ! Thou wouldst die content if he were spared ! But his blood shall be shed as well as thine ! And his blood first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ! ALICE O , Heaven ! YORICK Choose thy sword . EDMUND Yes , to sheathe it in my breast . Chooses sword and turns point to his breast . YORICK Turning his sword againt Alice . And I sheathe mine in thy paramour . EDMUND Throws himself before Alice . Ho ld ! YORICK Then defend ! And remember well It is the hand of vengeance threatens her . ALICE No , in the name of pity let me die . EDMUND As long as I have life thou shalt not die . YORICK Then thou art ready to defend her and Wilt fight with me ? EDMUND I will . YORICK In very earnest ! Regardless who I am and who thou art ? EDMUND Yes ! YORICK And thou'lt do thy best to kill me ? EDMUND Yes ! By Heaven , I will . ALICE O , stay ! EDMUND No ! Never ! ALICE Listen ! EDMUND This man is thy enemy . ALICE Eternal Heaven ! YORICK Good ! Then we fight this quarrel to the death ? EDMUND Crime cries for crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They fight . ALICE Clinging to Edmund . Oh , hold ! EDMUND Unhand me ! ALICE Wait ! YORICK Thou makest him lose heart . ALICE Clinging to Yorick . Then do thou be merciful ! YORICK Thou aidest him against me ! ALICE O , cruel ! Fight resumed . EDMUND Wounded  --  drops sword . Heavens ! YORICK Look ! To Alice . ALICE Ah ! EDMUND Dying . God forgive me ! ALICE Help ! Mercy ! YORICK Silence ! Enter Heywood . HEYWOOD Yorick ! What hast thou done ? Enter Woodford , Thomas , and the actors and the employees . They crowd around , hiding bodies from audience . Alice is taken away . HEYWOOD , to Audience : The play can not go on ! Carried away by his part , the comedian , Yorick , has seriously wounded the actor who was playing Manfredo . ( To Prompter . ) Bring down the curtain ! The small curtain descends , and what follows is seen and heard through this transparent curtain . WOODFORD : But where is Walton ? HEYWOOD : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Seeing Yorick . ) Stand aside . YORICK Oh ! My boy , my boy ! Why , look you , Master , He was a little lad when first I saw him , Tattered and wan with hunger  --  with such eyes Full of such silent histories of want and sorrow , Orphanage and all the world 's unkindness They went straight to my heart . I took him home . And there I kept him ever since  --  and he Lies dead within my heart . Oh , I could Tell you such things of him . I used to Watch him in the night and rise And listen to his breathing  --  feel his pulse To know if any sickness threatened him . His childish joys made me a happy man . You all can hear me witness how I loved him . My love has made me many a time the laugh Of all of you . Oh ! now methinks I dream And am not I , or was not what I am ! And now this hand , to which thy little hand So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand hath murdered thee ! No ! No ! Master ! Tell me how could I kill my boy ? It must have been an accident  --  A slip of the foot  --  an error of the hand . Lend me thy sword , good Master . Since mine hath pierced his heart I can not touch it . Snatches sword . Why , be not afraid ! You are thinking of that blackamoor of Venice And surely not of this poor merry Yorick That never yet was apt for tragedy . I shall not harm myself . I am past all harm . It must have happened thus . Turns point  --  to breast  --  all start . He laughs and removes it . Nay , do not fear . If I should pass this rapier through my heart , It would not harm me . I am dead within ! HEYWOOD He is mad ! YORICK No ! Was mad ! Kneeling to Edmund . Oh ! My boy , my boy ! Kiss me once more ! My boy ! Thy lips as yet Warm with the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Edmund ! Edmund ! Oh ! My son ! My hope ! My pride ! My hero among men ! My good Sweet boy ! My little loving lad ! Kisses him . Dead ! Dead ! Dead ! Here , Master , take thy sword . It tempts me ! Stabs himself . Pray for us , Master  --  for him  --  for her ! But most of all for me . " Vengeance is the Lord 's . I will repay , " He said . How dark it grows . Ring down the curtain . So ! So !
