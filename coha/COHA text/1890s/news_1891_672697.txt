txt The " panic mongers who are trying to destroy the credit of the Government in the hope of partisan advantage " by talking about the " impending bankruptcy of the Treasury " have been roundly denounced of late by patriotic Republican newspapers . They can endure the denunciation without personal inconveniences , since they have no persons and no bodily existence , being , in short , mere myths and fancies of the Republican imagination . But neither have those persons and newspapers for whom the castigation was really meant , those , namely , who have demonstrated the nearly complete success of a Republican Congress  --  carrying out with literal faithfulness the Republican Party policy ? in emptying the National Treasury suffered in feelings or repute , for the truth of what they have said about the state of the Government funds is from day to day and from week to week sustained by official statements from the Treasury . Mr. Joux M. CARSON , the Washington correspondent of the Philadelphia Ledger , is a Republican , and can scarcely be accused of seeking a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury which he prepares for his paper . In a dispatch to the Ledger of yesterday Mr. CARSON shows very clearly the inroads upon the Treasury balance made by the last Congress . The statement issued on Saturday showed a " net available balance " in the Treasury of ** The amount held by banks and the fractional coin in the Treasury vaults , both items amounting on June 1 to $43,000,000 , if added to the net available balance make a " general balance " of nearly $47,000,000 . This " general balance , " it will be observed , includes the small coins that can not be used in ' Treasury payments for sums exceeding $10 and . the deposits in the banks that can not be largely drawn upon without inducing business disturbances of which the Administration would not like to be the cause . After alluding to the wellknown causes of this condition of the Treasury , the extravagance of Congress , and the falling off in customs receipts , Mr. CARSON says : " The rapidity and extent of the depletion of the Treasury will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1890 , and contrasting that with the present condition . One year ago the net balance was $55,400,749 ; fractional coins , $23,002,008 , making a total balance of $78,411,757 . At that time the amount held for the redemption of national bank notes was $55,619,360 . Under the not of July 14 this amount was covered into the Treasury cash , and since that date has been counted as part of the net balance . Adding the amount of this trust fund held last July to the balance then on hand would give as the general balance $134 , - 031,117 . Against that the Treasury now holds as a general balance , which includes all funds . $47,021,781 , a loss of $87,000.000 in twelve months . There is due the national bank-note redemption fund about $44,000,000 , which amount is not carried as a liability . If this obligation should be paid the Treasury would be cleaned out of all its funds . including fractional coin , with the exception of about $3,000,000 . " In its headline the Ledger describes this as " a dangerously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was probably not made for a , " partisan advantage . " But it can not be said with confidence that the worst is over . Mr. CARSON points out that the customs receipts may continue to fall off , and that the appropriations made at the last session of tho Fifty-first Congress , more wastefully and wickedly extravagant than those of the first session , will become available after July 1 , and " the expenditures , therefore , will continue on a grand scale for at least another year , unless the President and the Secretary of the Treasury interfere and prevent payments other than those that are imperative and unavoidable . " As these statements are made by a gentleman who is a Republican and not a " panic monger " they deserve the attention of intelligent Republicana who are reluetantlo accept statements of established facts from sources justly or - unjustly suspected of partisanship . And since these intelligent Republicans may recall former low-tariff criticisms of swollen Treasury balances and large annual surpluses , it may be proper to add - that the present critics of the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the money is out of the Treasury so much as at the manner of its getting out  --  through the window ,
