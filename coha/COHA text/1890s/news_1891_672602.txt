txt O. S. Bushnell of city , Vice President of . the Eriosson Coast De-1 lease Company , which has just had the old Destroyer taken out of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and hauled up on Simpson 's dry dock , at South Brooklyn , for repairs . says , in regard to the fitting up of the vessel for the trial of a newlyinvented gun : " On the Destroyer , the late Capt . Ericsson and C. II . Delamater spent $150,000 . The vessel is 120 feet long and is substantially constructed , though now In great need of repairs . Our company has a capital of $250,000 . We are fitting up the vessel for the purpose of testing a gun I that will fire under water . Now , with the heavy nettings which the big war vessels have for the protection of themselves against torpedoes , the ordinary projectiles are almost useless . " But with the gun that is to be tested on the Destroyer we eau make a projectile penetrate any of the nettings that are now in use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will experiment with is being constructed at Bethlehem , I'enn. , and is about half done . It is to be 33 feet iu length . Tile projectile is to be 23 feet long and to throw it a charge of twenty-five pounds of powder will be used . The shell will contain from 300 to 400 pounds of nitro-glycerine , enough to blow up any vessel attest if Struck right . The muzzle of the gun will protrude for ten feet under water and the projectile will be carried from 750 to 1,000 feet . The projectile will extend eight feet beyond the muzzle of the gun before firing . We intend to try the gun for the first time at Newport next July . having obtained from Congress au appropriation for making the tests . " With a few such vessels as the Destroyer will be when equipped with our gun , the armed fleets of the world could be swept out of existence . I believe that this invention will revolutionize naval gunnery throughout the world . One of our shells can be sent right through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a torpedo could not penetrate . Commodore lotger of the Ordnance Department has written a letter to me saying that he has prepared a heavy steel netting for a target upon which our gun eau be tested . Later we shall buy an old hulk and blow it up with one of our percussion shells , to show the efficacy of the new gun . " 1 think that if the test proves satisfactory the Government will arm some of the naval yes ? eels with it For the price that one of our big new ships would cost we could build and arm five of the smaller ships , which would be able to sink the best navy afloat . If the nations should arm their navies with these guns it would so enhance their destructive power that the powers would not dare to go to war with each other . Since ships have been armed with the Hotchkiss rapid-firing guns there has not been a naval battle . In a sea tight these guns would cause terrible havoc . ' Vessels of the Destroyer type are to be heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being injured . These vessels will be only a font out of the water , and that part will be armored , so very little will be exposed to an enemy 's guns . One of these vessels , made to steam at great speed , can be made very effective . "
