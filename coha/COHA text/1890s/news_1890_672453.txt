txt Senator Frank Hiscock is filling up a good many columns of the Congressional Record nowadays with remarks upon . the Tariff bill and subjeots connected therewith and brought out in the debate . The Senator 's temerity is greater than his discretion , and the way he has floundered about in his selfassumed capacity as the champion of the high protectionists has been as painful to his friends as it has been pleasing to the tariff reformers . Mr. Hiscook 's discretion must have gone woolgathering to-day when he spoke with a sneer of Mr. as a Senator who " resolutely and with such Roman firmness proposed to strangle the pottery industry in his own State so as to show his patriotism and devotion to party . " It occurred to some of those who listened to Mr. Hiscock that the pottery interests of New-Jersey became a very small matter in comparison with the neighboring interests of New-YorkCity , andyet everyimporterknows that the New-York Senator has resolutely and with Roman firmness proposed to strangle the importing industry of his own State so as to show his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fried out of theta by the managers of the last campaign . To-day 's tariff debate , as a whole , seemed very familiar to those who heard the debate of - two years ago . The pending question was on Mr. Vest 's proposal to reduce the duties on plain . and decorated china , but after Mr. Vest and Mr. Allison had talked on that subject a little , the discussion widened out and the old , old story of the effect of high duties on the wages of labor was told and retold . Mr. George made a long and very earnest speech on this subject in particular and the tariff in general . He stirred up the Connecticut Senators , who made replies , full of figures , about the prosperity of their State . Mr. Platt 's remarks in turn called out Mr. Jones of Arkansas , who made an effective use of the official statistics of the Commissioner of Labor . Mr. Jones provoked Mr. Edmunds into taking part in the controversy , and the two Senators amused the Senate by drawing directly opposite results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally got ready to vote on the Vest amendment , the yeas and nays showed the absence of a quorum and an adjournment was promptly ordered . The vote showed a third departure from party lines , in the person of Mr. Ingalls ; who joined Mr. Plumb and Mr. Paddock in supporting the amendment . When the Tariff bill was taken up , the question . being upon Mr. Vest 's amendment to reduce the duty on decorated china to 50 per cent , ad. valorem , and on plain white , undecorated china . to 40 per cent. , instead of 60 and 55 per cent . in the House bill and of 55 and 50 as proposed by the Finance Committee . Mr. Vest argued in support of his amendment , and having had occasion in the course of his remarks to question a statement made by Mr. Brewer , a pottery manufacturer of Trenton , N. J. , he spoke of that gentleman as having , when he was a member of the House of Representatives at the time the Tariff bill of 1883 was before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belleek , " and said that that represented in its cost 99 per cent , of labor , conveying the impression that that ware was generally manu- factured in this country , while the fact was that the article exhibited was the only one made at the time , so that the assertion that it represented 99 per cent . of labor was probably true . He therefore did not choose to take Mr. Brewer 's statement . He was a very honorable man , but he was a manufacturer , and his statement was an ex parte one . Mr. Hiscock , replying to Mr. Vest , said that he imagined there was not a member of the House at that time who did . not know that the article exhibited by Mr. Brewer was not then made in the United States , except as anexperiment . He referred sarcastically to Mr. as a Senator who " resolutely and with such Roman firmness proposed . to strangle the pottery industry in his own State so as to show his patriotism and devotion to party . " Mr. asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that statement , but the request was declined , and Mr. Riaeock proceeded with his argument on the china paragraph , facoring ? the rates in the House Nil as against the rates recommended by the Finance Committee . ' Mr. Allison entered into the discussion and declared his understanding of the intention of the Finance Committee to beneither to diminish nor to increase the duties on chinaware , and he went on to argue that that intent was carried out in the amendments recommended by that committee . He expressed the belief that the pottery industry required a reasonably high . duty in order to make it successful in the United States . He wished to make the duties on that and all other industries so reasonable and just as to give the American producer a shade of advantage over the foreign producer . Mr. Gorman congratulated and thanked Mr. Allison for his frank statement . After a further discussion of the chinaware paragraph , Mr. George took the floor and made a long speech on the general subject of the tariff , contending that protection had nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various surrounding circumstances . Referring to a statement heretofore made by Mr. Teller that half the wealth of the country was owned by 100,000 persons , he said that if the system of parentalism , which assumed the regulation by the Government of the business , the lives , and fortunes of men , was continued , as the pending bill proposed to continue it , a sentiment would be produced which would not be , he feared , helpful to the country . If men ? saw that they were robbed or pillaged or taxed for the benefit of others , while they themselves were kept in. poverty , they would inquire why the same Government agencies that robbed them of their daily toil for the benefit of the over-rich should not be employed to take from the spoiler that which he had unjustly got . He did not wish to see that day come . Mr. Platt repelled. and denounced an assertion made by Mr. George to the effect that , while the duty on steel rails was $11 a ton , the labor in producing the article cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , but the fact was that , if the production of a ton of steel rails cost $24 , the labor portion of that cost was not only $1.54 , but ten times that amount . Mr. Hewitt had put his foot on that misrepresentation in the House of Representatives in a Tray that ought to be remembered by Democratic Senators . Mr. Hawley also commentedupon Mr. George 's speech . and remarked that he had heard that Senator say much the same thing before , and that his remarks had then been quite as conclusively contradicted as they had just now been by his colleague , ( Mr. Platt ) He ridiculed the solemnity with which Mr. George had intimated that the people at the North were living over a volcano , and said that if he would . make such a. speech in New-England he would be considered . as supplementing a negro minstrel company for the amusement of his hearers . Mr. Jones of Arkansas undertook to confirm Mr. George 's statement about steel rails by the official report of Mr. Carroll D. Wright , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The raw material of the steel rail manufacturer was tho steel ingot , and Mr. Wright had given the cost of making the rail from the ingot as $1.54 per ton . The Senator from Mississippi had said ( Mr. Jones argued ) nothing to the nentrary . Mr. Edmunds attempted to convince Mr. Jones that he was entirely mistaken in the matter , but he was not successful in the effort . His explanation was that the difference in cost between the steel ingot and the steel rail was $2.27 , or which amount labor got $1.54 , but Mr. Jones could not or would not see it in that light . On the contrary , he held that Mr. Wright understood his business and knew what he was saying . Mr. Jones , however . left that point and came back to the Chinaware matter . apropos of which . and of the question of trusts , he read a report from Findlay , Ohio , as to the purchase by an English syndicate of various glass works in Findlay , Bellaire , Columbus , Fostoria and other towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to encourage such trusts and syndicates . Mr. Reagan , in discussing the general question of protection , spoke of the organization of farmers ' alliances and workingmen 's associations that were protesting against class legislation and Aundering lawe . He warned Senators that such a movement was not to be ignored . At* o'clock Mr. Aldrich ( intending to move an adjournment ) proposed that the vote on the pending question be taken Monday , without furtiter discussion . " Take a vote now . We are ready . We are aiwaysready to vote as soon aediscussion is over , " were the responses from several Senators on the Democratic side . Mr. Aldrich did not think there was a quorum present , but lie was willing to try . The vbto was taken en Mr. Vest 's amendment and the result was  --  yeas 17 , nays 20 ; no quorum . The Senate then adjourned .
