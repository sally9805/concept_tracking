INTRODUCTION Sir Francis Bacon has written that " Frendship maketh indeed a faire day in the Affections " , and it is because of the many fair days awakened in our memory of Clyde Fitch , that we are attempting , in this foreword to a Memorial Edition of some of his plays , to re-create the flavor of his personality which was dear to us . In the writing of biography , there is no better course to follow , no better philosophy to maintain , than the inner beauty of little things ,  --  those quotidian moments which strike sparks from the spirit , yet are not thought of at the time , because they do not represent crises in a life . Maeterlinck 's contribution to modern thinking is that the exalted is ever near us , even in the silence ; and , when he came to write essays on Emerson and Novalis , he brought into high light those moral qualities underlying the small act , the casual thought ,  --  and made nothing of the event . Thinking over our association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him are those acts and services which were done largely through moral forces in his character . Under such conditions it is difficult to separate the man from the act , difficult to dissociate the locality from the personality , difficult to assume an impersonal judgment without paying a personal tribute . He was one of the best of friends , one of the most loyal of associates . His genius for friendship was not merely the ability to attract to him the love of others , but the gift of drawing from others the best that was in them . In all of his activities , he was ever generous , ever courteous , ever anxious to spare the trouble and to share the gain . His life was a busy one , filled with the obligations of an ever-increasing profession . In one respect it may be said that from the time Clyde Fitch began to be regarded as America 's most popular playwright , each year found him externally doing the same things ,  --  fulfilling contracts , selecting casts , arranging rehearsals , and attending " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine until , during the last year of his life , he was attempting sufficient to undermine the health of the strongest man . Every year found him abroad , noting with the quick eye of the trained expert what was best in the Continental theatres , and meeting Charles Frohman or some other American manager , in order to read a manuscript or to talk over an embryo comedy . It was the life of a successful literary man of the theatre , and was filled with interesting associations , correspondences , and travels . All of this may be brought to light some day in another form , yet we can not but feel that , after all is said , after the last word has been uttered , the true significance of Clyde Fitch lay in the spirit rather than in the letter of what he did . The mere story-element in his plays is something an inventive mind other than his might be able to duplicate ; the technique of his drama is a matter many clever playwrights might be able to explain . But the Fitchean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , and verbal twist , are characteristics no one has been able to emulate . Such literary elusiveness is what is meant when we say that the style is the man . Since the death of Clyde Fitch , the New York stage  --  and that means the stage of the entire country  --  has missed his distinctive contributions to a dramatic season . Without exactly analyzing why , we believe that the Fitch theatregoing public miss him for exactly the same reason  --  though not so intimate a one  --  as his friends miss him . The personal equation is gone , and all that is left of him is the rich memory of his presence ,  --  and his plays which must ever be regarded as healthy contributions to American drama . We who knew him see in those plays a large part of the man himself ,  --  sympathy for human problems , quick observation of minute details , interest in moral actions and their consequences , the love of beautiful things , and a refreshing approach toward life . Those are the qualities which no artifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unconsciously born of the character of thought and expression . And that is why the personality of Clyde Fitch is bound up in his work . If his life were to be told in brief , we should point to his childhood in Schenectady , New York ; his college days at Amherst ; his struggles to maintain himself in New York with his short stories ; his writing of " Beau Brummell ; " and then the open but slow road toward success . We remember one of his anecdotes about a reading he gave in Schenectady , where he returned in after years . The account was scribbled on a train as he was going to Chicago where " Nathan Hale " was to be rehearsed . The reading at Schenectady was to be from this play , and from his " Smart Set " sketches . In the large audience that turned out to greet him , he recognized the familiar face of his little , fat music teacher whose sense of humor got the better of her as she listened to the story . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so funny that he dropped his book on the floor and laughed for five whole minutes , keeping the audience waiting meanwhile . Clyde Fitch never lost that hearty , natural , boyish laugh of his ; there was a contagious " funniness " about it that was good to hear . He was always proud of his Amherst connection ; always proud of the college pride in him . Those who are fortunate enough to look back on undergraduate days with him will recollect a certain reticence , a certain shyness which at times misled people as to the firmness beneath . This latter characteristic is exemplified by a story told in retrospect by one of Mr. Fitch 's professors . " I remember , " he said , " that when Clyde first appeared upon the campus , he wore a suit of a peculiar blue  --  sufficiently blue and peculiar to call down upon him the ruthless jibing of the upper classmen . For days he persisted in his attire , and faced the music . So I was not surprised when , one evening , he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation and asked my advice . I felt that whatever decision he might make must come from him , and I told him so . Then in a perfectly quiet voice he said , as he turned to go , ' I guess I 'll stick it out . ' " We have vividly in mind a picture of the college graduate launched upon a career of his own choosing . For if Clyde Fitch had followed his father 's choice he would have been an architect . He always possessed a strong art taste , manifest in his collecting of antiques , and asserting itself in the three homes he came to build . But , at the beginning , his art taste and his literary income were incompatible . Those who saw him in his studio days , saw the real artist  --  always eager for some objet d'art , and spending his small checks  --  paid him for his stories  --  in some much-coveted prize . Mr. Fitch was ever eager to enjoy these humorous anecdotes about himself . He never regarded himself as anything more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the very best of his ability . And we suppose the incidents that went to make up his life were not extraordinary , despite the special atmosphere which his calling created around him . But his significance rests in his achievement , and in the manner in which he responded to the daily happenings in his life . Like all boys , there came a time when he had to break from his youthful surroundings in order to develop himself , but this break left him with an affectionate feeling for those faces that looked out at him from faded tintypes . There is no telling how much of those associations slipped into his plays . He never , however , broke from those early ties . There was a tremendous element of pride in the make-up of Clyde Fitch ; he was thoroughly conscious of his family position , and his reverence for relationship was only another evidence of that loyalty we have spoken of . There was likewise a pride in his friendship , shown whenever someone close to him met with deserved recognition . With this pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his earliest business relations . One can not read the plays included in this Memorial Edition without feeling how evident was the spiritual development of Clyde Fitch . In a copy of " Beau Brummell , " sent to a friend , he wrote , " I send this as a curiosity . It was my Alpha Beta . But how well the theatre has progressed beyond the bric -- brac stage . " He had his bric -- brac expression  --  a youthful exuberance that never left him ,  --  a decorativeness which is a part of fresh rather than of staid vision . In four of his dramas this unusual color found dominant expression . Mr. Fitch took peculiar personal pleasure in the " period " story . To the details of writing he gave special care ; and when the time came to externalize them , he was untiring in his efforts . Even in such a simple comedy as " Lovers ' Lane , " during rehearsals , he spent hours fastening apples and pinning blossoms in the orchard scene . In " Beau Brummell , " at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in " Barbara Frietchie " and " Nathan Hale " his correspondence shows a particularity which was thorough and searching . His special expertness in feminine psychology , as exemplified in a series of plays culminating in " The Girl with the Green Eyes " and " The Truth , " became in later years his greatest bone of contention with the critics , who denied that he would ever be able to depict a man 's character . As an answer to this charge he gave to the public one of his most vivid stage personages  --  Sam Coast , in " Her Great Match , "  --  and this vigor on his part was but the beginning of that decisiveness and sharpness uppermost in " The City . " In some of his very earliest comedies , Clyde Fitch likewise won for himself the title of the playwright of New York city , and no one has as yet been able to surpass him in catching the evanescent peculiarities of the town . " Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines " had all the flavor of old-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about , but something he seemed to have felt . Here was his old love for a " period " cropping out . But between that and " Girls "  --  his most realistic and detailed treatment of apartment-house life in its externals  --  there are a great many of his dramas that are excellent Kodak films of the city , subject to his sensitized impression . Looking on these plays from their outside , there is a superabundance of cleverness which in itself would have won for him a name . Mr. Fitch had the fictionist 's feeling of character for its own sake to such a superabundant degree that , as in the case of " The Happy Marriage "  --  which he always seemed to treasure as a good piece of work  --  he would throw away in casual reference whole ideas and situations capable of serious development . It was this ease of technique that sometimes belied the deeper penetration beneath , which he possessed and which dominated his conversation . When the actual time came for writing , the rapidity of his mere recording was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a subject for his play . How often  --  long before he put pen to paper  --  would he exclaim that he was anxious to get at his " jealousy piece " , meaning , of course , " The Girl with the Green Eyes . " Often we have seen him , seated on a stone by the countryside , writing with a rapidity comparable to an artist sketching . Many of his friends remember his temptation , while at the Opera , to jot down bits of dialogue  --  for music always set his imagination astir . Yet he would never obtrude his inventive vagaries upon others . When the curtain was down , he was always the centre of conversation , always the life of the party . But we have a feeling that he regarded his attendance as a member of the Opera Club simply as a means toward an end . It was that quality of mental arrangement which enabled him to set down on paper whole situations with a rapidity which critics called haste . He once wrote from Italy , " ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was at work made me ill ; I knew so well what I wanted to write  --  it was copying something that one knows by heart . " And from London , on May 24th , 1902 , about " The Girl with the Green Eyes , " he wrote , " I have also just finished to-day Act 1 of Mrs. Bloodgood 's play . Of course it seems as if I were doing an awful lot of work . And I suppose it would be better if I did n't do so much , but I ca n't help it ! I limit my writing to three hours a day . However , the point about these plays is that I know them almost by heart . I 've been planning the Mannering piece since a year ago last Winter . I know it all ; it only wanted to be written down , and the same with the Bloodgood piece . It is n't as if I had to think up plot and situations . I 've had them for a long time . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intense nervous vitality ; his was a type of mind to take quickly , to hold tenaciously , and to communicate to others , through association ; that same subtle unrest which stimulates rather than wears out . Success never brought to him a self-satisfied outlook upon his work ; his deepening view of life was too vital for that . What it did seem to do to the very day of his death was to stir him to better effort . He was one of those rare workers who took criticism with a bigness and eagerness which only accentuated more fully his keenness to his defects . Writing from Paris , in July , 1905 , he made this confession : " ... I still am working like a horse , but I hope like one of those trained , intelligent horses ! Now , on the changes necessary in ' Her Great Match ' for London ; next on my Blanche Walsh play " The Woman in the Case " ; and to-morrow I go to London to cast the Frohman play , etc. , etc. , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I want to do ! But if I can only do it well ! I am trying . I think each year I try better to do better . " Such pressure which came with success was what always beset Clyde Fitch , the workman . It was not what he wanted , but what theatrical condition imposed on him . He had little time to do things leisurely . His morning mail was read rapidly and appreciatively ; his letters were answered out of the fulness of the moment ,  --  often prompted , not by the immediate necessity of the occasion , but because of some purely human quality discovered in a phrase or sentence . While abroad he would scribble notes on trains or in motor-cars , flowing over into the margins of the paper with an unchecked love of recording impressions . These letters  --  often postcards  --  were weighted down with personal flashes , showing humor , pathos , appreciation ; recording plans in nave declarations ; describing people and places with that surface irony which critics always took at its surface value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . These communications were significant in their revelation of the man . A letter from Florence , 1902 , came to its destination laden with the joyful appreciation of beauty , but , he confesses , " while I can look at pictures alone , I hate to eat alone . Just to eat bores me . " Yet his sociable instincts did not take from him an abiding love for the silence . This rush of work which followed him to town whenever he left his country place ; which trailed him across continent , making his progress a hasty circuit of live observations and rapid business negotiations  --  did not deprive him of a very serious attitude toward his work . If there was one quality uppermost in Clyde Fitch , the craftsman , it was his never-failing belief in what he had done . He wrote from Berlin , in April , 1908 , " I wish you dear  --  , who have always taken me and my work seriously , and know what I put into it , and from what a standard I wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception of ' The Truth ' . " With that tendency of his to underscore and double underscore his emphasis in letters , he declared , in August , 1900 , from St. Enogat , France , " I have had a disappointment . Frohman decides not to do ' The Climbers . ' It is a real bitter disappointment , for I believe so much in the play . " This belief led him to spend as much energy nurturing a play after it was launched , as he expended in the actual composition . Conviction brought out a dogged persistence which was often needed in the face of failure . But while maintaining a bold front to the public , his letters showed continually how much criticism discouraged him . Though we recognize in " The Truth " some of his best and most characteristic workmanship  --  it having attained Continental distinction  --  its initial production in New York was a failure . It was a play he believed in , and he slaved to keep it on the stage . In this instance , criticism nearly killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that it is impossible for me to succeed in New York with the present press ,  --  which will mean my laying down my pen . " This press served to accentuate two dominant traits in Clyde Fitch : his sensitiveness , and his patience . From the time of " Beau Brummell , " he was constantly repudiated by the dramatic critic . Yet we know from experience that no more open-minded man could be found than he in his eagerness to welcome suggestion and in his readiness to accept advice . We have seen a lengthy letter of his analyzing , with some justification , the stereotyped view of him held in America ; whereas abroad his recognition was based on qualities never attributed to him at home . I fear , he said in substance , the press has crystallized toward me . On another occasion he asked a critic to see one of his plays over again , valuing his opinion , and personally distressed that his opinion was a negative one . There was no vainglory about this ; there was an earnest desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and make it . In other words , there was nothing external after all in the representative plays of Clyde Fitch ; they were all closely evolved out of his own personality ; representative of his relationships , his outlook on life . He may have excelled in external detail , but the literary value of his work lies in the truth of his observation , and in the sincerity of his feeling for character . His thought was subservient to these , and sometimes overclouded by the cleverness of theatrical effect . Those who knew Clyde Fitch were at first drawn to him through a brilliancy of conversation which , however sparkling in his dialogue , was brought within bounds as soon as set down in words . He had a great dislike for the mediocre . He had many worldly interests , and his quick action , coupled with these , gave the impression that he lacked the powers of contemplation , of concentration . Yet soon , association with Mr. Fitch revealed a reverence and an humbleness which brought into play a certain calm reflection of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of Renan 's " Life of Christ ; " referring time and time again to the mystical devoutness of Maeterlinck . Some might disbelieve that he had deep-founded principles of faith ; yet he was almost old-fashioned in his moral acceptances , though welcoming and intellectually tolerant of the broadness of others . In people near him he required permanent rightness of thought , and reverence for the Real Thing , as his tradition taught him . He was once heard to say , " I can tell those that pray and those that do not . " It was impressed very strongly upon Mr. Fitch 's friends that he had other interests in life besides the theatre . Those things were necessary to him that developed the essential humanness of his nature . Slow to give his friendship ,  --  though ever willing to give plentifully of his interest ,  --  he clung to his permanent friends , even in the country , and less and less found satisfaction in the promiscuous associations of social life . Even to his valet he was a hero , though nothing pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he would laughingly put it , out of his valet 's implacable presence . We remember , after Mr. Fitch 's death , the grief of his man  --  an old-fashioned type of French servant , whose devotion had been tested in many ways . " We shall never forget what you have done , " a member of the family said , out of the fulness of the moment . And he replied simply : " A good master makes a good servant . " Such was his tribute ! Loyalty was deeply ingrained in Mr. Fitch 's character , nor was it a heedless offering of his friendship . There are many pictures of Clyde Fitch to conjure up in mind , the rarest being that of friend . We have noticed his letters signed " loyally yours , " and they were addressed only to those who had been proven . He had great patience with the people he trusted ,  --  and when he trusted , he did so unreservedly , even up to the very verge of doubt . His gratitude was abounding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many actors will remember how quick he was to detect in them the slightest evidence of generosity , accentuating it beyond its due proportion , and recalling it on all occasions . How well we understood that response in him which prompted him to add a postscript to one of his letters , " Give my love to those who remember me , and to those who do n't ,  --  if I love them . " One could never quite forget the companionableness of the man . We remember once on a visit to him , hearing him call to us , " Do n't you want to come down and have a cookie ? " And when we came to the Terrace where he was working , there would be no cookie , and he would go on writing ! But he knew that we were feeling the beauty of the country with him  --  were understanding beyond the mere necessity for interchange of words . This dramatist of city life was a great lover of nature ; he revelled in the out-of-doors ; and his garden was humanized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the simple things of life his dramatic eye saw every detail with freshness , and he expressed what he saw with a vivacity , an unusualness , that gave life to the picture . When he was moving from " Quiet Corner " to " The Other House , " he wrote to a friend : " We are moving ! ! The study is empty ! There is hardly a picture left ! The walls show thin wounds ! " I go daily to ' T. O. H. ' , buried in a heap of Old Masters , inside Pauline ( Panhard ) . " Ed. is planting trees , and I am planting pictures , and Monday we hope the curtains will sprout in the windows ; and Friday of next week I think the Katonah katydids will be singing my lullaby ! ! " Awful scandal at ' Q. C. ' ! In the Spring we put nine goldfish in the pool , and , when Bridge emptied it out this morning , there were sixty-five ! ! ! " And , with that never-failing hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make a real visit ... and not just play ' tag ' with the trams ? " " Quiet Corner , " in Greenwich , was built so that Mr. Fitch might live most of the time out in the open ; " The Other House , " at Katonah , gave him joy because it brought within reach all the beauties of a car country . The latter house , it is our impression , offered him greater peace , and here he would turn with relief after hard work in the city . In May , his East Fortieth Street house lost its holding power on him . " It mortifies me , " he writes , " to imagine what the lilacs must be thinking of us for not coming out . When I left , they had their little buds all ready to unpack ! and the syringa bush was giggling with little leaves ! ! " On one of his very last rides around Katonah , before going abroad on his final trip , he spoke of the glories of the Fall , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out to an old countryman on the road , who , all smiles , passed us with a nosegay in his ragged buttonhole . " Behind that flower is love , " exclaimed Mr. Fitch . This spirit in him often found expression in his correspondence . " I love the world , " he wrote . And this expansion came over him not suddenly but by slow process of spiritual deepening . For there was a time when Clyde Fitch might easily have fallen into the ways of dilettantism  --  those Sherwood Studio days on Fifty-seventh Street , when social life was trying to overcome his desires to work . And the exactions of a successful career imposed upon him many of the surface responsibilities , until that deepening of the spiritual side of him began to alter his entire approach toward life ,  --  an altering that meant a clearer assertion of his philosophy . This is seen in flashes of his later dialogue , and was strongly marked in " The City , " which was not only uttered in strength of conviction , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have gained a firmer stroke . More and more he began to value , above all other experiences , the Real Things in life . This is very apparent in his work  --  the increasing maturity of which can be detected from play to play along the entire course of his writing . Though he may have dealt , as a satirist , with the shams of social life , the thing that struck most people who came in contact with Clyde Fitch was that he was eminently sincere . And that sincerity he looked for in the approach of others . We do not recollect that he was given to retort unless it was called for by some insincerity of a friend , or some false statement of a critic . And when that was the case , the occasion brought from him characteristic touches of understanding , and a true measure of the Real Thing . An Editor once sent him the first three numbers of a new magazine , in which some reference had been made to him and his work . We quote his acknowledgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generous interest in current literary matters , and , above all , an outspoken expression of belief as regards himself . " Since writing you , " it runs " I 've been able to take up your three numbers , and with much interest . I congratulate you on an individual tone which you have certainly attained . The magazine has character . ... In my own field , however  --  ! Your writer is in earnest , and evidently deserves a good end , but I regret to find he is not working on new lines , or with new thoughts . He is not of the early Victorian Period , but I should say of the early McKinley . He repeats the old theories , the old formulas , of what is good and what is n't , the point of view about our drama of over a dozen years ago , when the whole thing was stereotyped . Your writer does not feel the new current . I mean just that , exactly ,  --  he floats on the surface , and sees only the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be characteristic of him . Your writer does not seem to me to realize what is underneath , which is the Real Thing . The Real Thing exists without a surface , but the surface adds to it one more note of value , besides its own personal value of being an individual characteristic . Wherefore : when your writer says of my work that it is ' still chiefly a display of dramatic millinery , ' then , for me , whatever he may say of the drama is worthless . No one knows better than I that my work is full of faults ; that 's why I go on writing ,  --  to correct them ,  --  at least it 's one reason why . But your man has n't hit the right faults  --  not by a long shot ! At least , I think that ; I may be wrong . All this because I had a few moments , and the telephone bell has n't rung since I began . " When Mr. Fitch moved to Katonah from Greenwich , he seemed to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted . His health had been almost undermined by the exactions of a busy career , and now he was beginning to hate all things that suggested vacillation , weakness , or ill-health . We have met him often on the East Terrace of " The Other House , " seeing with an eye as profoundly simple as Wordsworth 's , when he wrote his simplest lyric . " It was a lovely day , to-day , " he declares in a note , dated May , 1909 , " ... All afternoon I 've been out on the Terrace . The swans behaved like angels ! Even a white pond lily spread her wings on the pool . The peacock spread his tail  --  and you were n't there ! I could n't bear your not seeing all the poetry and beauty in the day  --  and now ( it is seven o'clock ) there is that divine murmuring sunset-light everywhere about ! " Again in June of that year , there is this spontaneous expression of himself : " I 've just come in from a walk with Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the meadow in the moonlight . The swans sailed softly mirrored , like Narcissus in the pool , and up in the rose garden it was thick with fireflies ! ! It was exquisitely beautiful . " This poetic quality was ever alive , and made of him a splendid companion on a journey . Nothing seemed to escape his quick observation , and he was able to convert the impression almost simultaneously into terms of human value . Travelling extensively , he picked up here and there chance acquaintances , from whom he gained a transitory enjoyment which was delightfully described in his letters . On such occasions his humor was never-failing in its assertion . There was a home quality about Clyde Fitch that few people believed he had , simply because his work kept him so constantly on the go . A jotting , dated January , 1906 , expressed eloquently his feelings on the subject . " Had a hotelly dinner in a hotelly hotel . Rehearsals going well  --  but what a life for a man who is n't in the drummer business ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ever alert in the study of his companions . When he saw one , seemingly in lonely mood , he was drawn to him through a sympathy which he was ever ready to show . Sometimes , these impulsive moves on his part rewarded him beyond his expectations . It was on an ocean liner that chance brought him in contact with an elderly lady of the Old School , whose friendship he always held in deepest consideration , and whose correspondence with him was a constant source of inspiration . On the other hand , in carriage compartments he would often meet with conversationalists who amused him up to the moment of unsought-for advice . " Do n't stop off at Pisa , " one of these chance acquaintances pleaded , " there 's nothing to see there but the tower , " and then he added , in the spirit of the perfect utilitarian , " You can see that from the train . " Yet " I got out , " adds Mr. Fitch in a letter , " and have been here for three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is detected in the mood of what follows : " The nights in these beautiful towns are all sad nights . One feels the need of some one to sit in silence with . " It was characteristic of Mr. Fitch that quickness of humor went side by side with a heart quality which made his humor all the more lovable . This gave a brilliant flash to his correspondence that desultory quoting can only suggest . Yet these suggestions reveal an inherited fund of native freshness . " Am bringing over with me an 1860 English cook , " he remarks from London , in 1901 , " who looks like a hair-cloth and rose-wood armchair  --  an ugly one . " In another breath he is referring to a dinner engagement which forces him to cut short his letter . " I wish I could be chloroformed , " he declared . He had the amusing habit of making light of his own discomforts as a seaman , and , in a log kept of a typical day and night aboard , we find such entries as , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vice versa . " This infinite variety , so manifest in infinite ways , is what made the friendship of Clyde Fitch a rare day in the affections . If he was among his flowers , he showed personal care for each rose bush . His animals and birds received from him a goodly share of his day 's attention . Even in the midst of strenuous work , with guests in the house , he would write with a wonderful power of giving everything and everyone personal consideration . He possessed a rare ability of self-effacement . Yet no one was more delighted than he when a person for whom he cared showed interest in what he was doing . Then it was that he would talk of his characters , and of the situations he had recently invented , and he would ask advice as though he were in collaboration . Were the guest fortunate enough to be taken even deeper into his confidence , probably Mr. Fitch would read the newest play to him . And that was no mean opportunity , for it was a saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept a play by Clyde Fitch on the spot , do n't let him read it to you ! " Our memory retains vividly the details of that evening " The City " was finished  --  in the rough state just before final revision . He read it aloud ; the graphic power of his acting in the quiet of the country , far into the early hours of the morning , is never to be forgotten . Though he never went on the stage , his ability to illustrate what he was anxious to obtain in acting , was constantly manifest . And his gratefulness to the actor who worked with him to gain these effects was never-failing . To one of them he wrote , just after having been interviewed : " I said the most enthusiastic things I could think of , of you  --  because I feel them . " Such enthusiasm for the individual always culminated with him in such exclamations as , " God bless the personal equation  --  and God bless you . " In November of 1908 , a letter contained some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor 's faithfulness . " Alas , poor  --  , " he wrote , " is getting too old , and we have to change her . It breaks my heart ; I fear it will nearly kill her . I am writing in a bit for her in the last act , so as to keep her in the company . ... " It was this quality in him that made him considerate  --  often far too considerate  --  of the appeals which deluged his mail daily . One only had to have a sincere ring to a request to elicit a quick response , and obtain an appointment . And if Mr. Fitch thought there was a possibility of using such a person to their mutual advantage , he would motor miles in order to keep such an appointment . There was no saving of himself . Had there been , his vitality might have withstood the sudden illness at Chlons-sur-Marne , which resulted in his death on September 4 , 1909 .

Theatregoers of over a decade in range will treasure the excellence of Mary Mannering in " The Stubbornness of Geraldine , " of Mrs. Clara Bloodgood in " The Truth " and in " The Girl with the Green Eyes . " Then there was Maxine Elliott , whose early career was largely enriched by her work in " Nathan Hale " and " Her Own Way ; " and Amelia Bingham in " The Climbers . " So we might go through a longer list of professional association . It may be said in truth that through his efforts , many a player was brought rapidly to the front . In the making of " stars " he was noted , though sometimes he failed , as in the instance of " Major Andr , " in which he was convinced that his friend , Arthur Byron , would meet with deserved recognition . His correspondence with Mr. Byron contains ample evidence of his generosity of spirit ; reveals likewise his ever alert interest in a production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actor , he was ever thoughtful of taking the actor into his confidence . All through his rehearsing of " Andr , " he was sending Mr. Byron details of his plans . Now it is , " I have thought of some good business for ' Andr , ' " or again , " I do not want the regulation colonial designs . " On his trip abroad , during the preparations for this play , he began to chafe over the smallness of the stage in the Savoy Theatre , where " Andr " was booked to open . Doubtless , in his visit to European theatres , he had seen novelties he wanted to introduce but could not . One can detect a note of desire in his declaration that he had seen " some very beautiful staging and lighting . I wish we had more room in the Savoy Theatre . " But Mr. Fitch was never one to aim at huge effects ; there was more delicacy in his workmanship  --  a delicacy well brought out in his " bloodless " war dramas , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recognized that the American manager was fine  --  the word underlined five times  --  as a stage manager of big effects , " and equally bad of subtle ones . " All during the arrangements for " Andr , " Mr. Fitch was largely concerned about the future of his friend . It was this concern that prompted him to write , " You know my interest in you is not bounded by ' Andr ' ; it is bounded by Byron ! and if ' Andr ' fails , we must have something else . " His correspondence with Mr. Byron contains reference after reference for him to read up on the dress of Andr , and in order to create in the actor and manager a distinct feeling for the time and place , Mr. Fitch motored Mr. McKee and Mr. Byron to the exact spot where Andr was captured . " We saw the spot ... , " he writes , " the prison where he spent his last night , and the stone that marks the place where he was hung . The latter on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon already risen in front . It was a beautiful sight , and so full of romance feeling . I am pretty well worn out ! It has been my most difficult task , and nothing ready yet ! It all lies closer to my heart , I think , than any other play . " Such was his feeling at the moment ; but when the papers rejected it , he confessed to Byron that " our failure to draw has at least been a dignified one . " And with renewed energy he turned his attention to another play . Such was the attitude of Clyde Fitch toward all with whom he came in contact . It is true that many of his plays were written for definite actors ; long before he put pen to paper he was feeling his way for people he wanted in his casts  --  and he was in that position , as a successful playwright , where he could indicate to his managers what he wanted . They usually let him have charge of the preparations . At the time of his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The City ; " he had selected his " star " for a farce which was well under way ; and he was negotiating with a young woman whose career he had watched with interest , and whose talent he believed in . Add to this the fact that , during the year 1909 , " The Truth " had been played in nearly every large theatrical centre in Europe , and that " The Woman in the Case " had just taken London by storm , and we are justified in claiming that , at the time of the death of Clyde Fitch , he was among the foremost of American dramatists , and certainly the best known abroad . If possible , Europe received him with greater clat than he was ever given in his own country . Writing from Hamburg , in April , 1908 , he claims that neither in France nor Germany can he find any good plays to adapt , for they are " very talky-talky , and all hard brilliancy ; no heart or big nature behind them . But this is what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in Italy for ' The Truth , ' La Verit , but they complain of my Puritanism . They say I have ' exquisite wit , ' ' originality , ' and ' deep psychology , ' but I think they were a little disappointed there were no Indians in it . " This first volume of the Memorial Edition contains two examples of Clyde Fitch 's genuine love for special atmosphere . He got into a period with precision ; he instinctively felt it ; and he worked for every little effect which would accentuate it . As someone said of " Captain Jinks , " there was no mistaking it for the period of the hoop skirt ; it was distinctly of 1872 , when the bustle was la mode . The career of Mr. Fitch really began with the success of " Beau Brummell . " There lies before us as we write a faded scenario as it was first presented to Mr. Mansfield ; we have also a letter , dated November 6 , 1889 , while he was living at the Sherwood Studios , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play . It is a youthful letter , splendidly joyful . And it may be said that it was ever his habit , even in the after years of his success , to greet each new commission with the same fulness of expectation . " My dear  --  , " he writes , " I have been kept from answering your kind letter because I have not been able to know if I am to be in town Saturday or not . Now , however , I think it most likely that I shall be , and in that case will accept your invitation with eagerness , if you wish to have me with this mite of uncertainty . It is all apropos of something wonderful for me , which is also a very great secret . ... Negotiations are on the tapis for a play to be written for RICHARD MANSFIELD by WM . CLYDE FITCH , and I am awaiting a dispatch now to go to Philadelphia to clinch things with Mansfield , who is playing there this week . It all may elude my grasp , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , is n't it , oh , is n't it an opportunity ! The subject of the play is to be ' Beau Brummell ' . ... I am not settled yet , and I have had two teeth pulled ! ! but those that are left and I are , Faithfully yours , W. C. F. " It seems , however , that the engagement of Mr. Fitch for supper was not kept , but instead came the welcome news that IT , meaning the scenario , had been accepted . Then , on December 10th , word was sent that he and Mansfield were working daily , talking and planning , and arranging for early rehearsals . It was Mr. E. A. Dithmar , of the New York Times , who was instrumental in bringing Mansfield and Clyde Fitch together , for he knew that here was a subject well suited to the artistic taste of his young friend . Indeed , there was a picturesqueness about the meteoric rise and fall of the Beau which always had appealed to Mr. Fitch  --  the detailed elegance which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for Mr. Mansfield to depict . Despite those critics who dismissed the play with the casual comment that there was nothing in Brummell 's life of a dramatic character , Mr. Fitch and Mr. Mansfield found copious material for graphic portraiture . While the play was always close to his heart , Mr. Fitch nevertheless recognized in it during after years a great amount of plot machinery which his maturer technique would never have been satisfied to let remain . But " Beau Brummell " is nevertheless a distinct piece of genre work . He was to return to the Beau theme once more in " The Last of the Dandies , " but we believe it true that had he approached the subject with less seriousness  --  for here he became engrossed in the father-love of his Dandy  --  had he used the same surface feeling he put into " Beau Brummell , " he would have duplicated his success . " Lovers ' Lane " was written several years before it was produced . It was at first called " The Parson , " and Sir George Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he failed to make use of it within the stipulated time . Its theme is of the simplest order , and was called forth by the challenge that Mr. Fitch would be unable to create characters other than those of a period or of the city . But though Clyde Fitch was identified in his plays with a certain social level , " Lovers ' Lane " is a pleasant departure , showing his sympathy with the country type . The character of the Minister , and the little incident of his constant interruptions , appealed strongly to him . The staging of " Nathan Hale " was a matter that won his undivided attention . He always placed great importance on lights , and he felt how much that early cool daybreak light , turning into sunrise , with the first twitter of birds in the trees , meant in the creation of that ineffable sadness of the final scene , with Nathan Hale under the blue sky and beneath the apple blossoms , brought forth to die . In the same spirit he worked in " Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . It often happened that Mr. Fitch was his own competitor in a theatrical season . For example , when " Lovers ' Lane " was given its premire , there were running at the time in New York , " Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines , " " Barbara Frietchie , " and " The Climbers . " " The Cowboy and the Lady " was first produced in Philadelphia , with great success , " and is doing even a bigger business than ' Hale , ' " wrote Mr. Fitch . " I am sorry to have it beat ' Hale , ' but if any play is going to beat it , I 'd rather it was one of mine , eh ? " There was something very personal about the stage management of Clyde Fitch , and the time will come when a mass of data  --  comments of his own , and those of his associates  --  will be brought together in some fuller reflection than has here been attempted . Such a compilation will illustrate his unswerving devotion to his craft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The majority of his plays would stand revival now , because of their essential human appeal , and because the characters are eternally true . Very slight alteration had to be made in " The Truth " when it was revived in the Spring of 1914 . The very permanence of literature is due , not to material truthfulness , but to the realization of constant human factors . This realization was caught by Mr. Fitch with originality , deftness , and a certain swift wit . There was a vein in him native of New York city , but it was more truly native of Clyde Fitch , the man . It is our firm belief that , through the plays contained in this Memorial Edition , readers will discover much that " maketh indeed a faire day in the Affections . " Even if there was not the testimony of his friends , one would be able to detect in his written word the manner of man we have here so sketchily portrayed . For , as Matthew Arnold says , in his poem on " The Future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his thoughts been . " Montrose J. Moses , Virginia Gerson . New York , July , 1915 . Note : 1Kb THE FIRST ACT .

A cheerful room , furnished more like a lady 's boudoir than a man 's dressing-room . A handsome dressing-table , covered with a bewildering array of silver-topped bottles , stands at the Left . A large cheval-glass stands in front of a bay window opening out on a balcony . The curtains are open . The door at the back leads into the Beau 's bedroom . A table stands at one side , with books and papers in precise order . A door at the left-hand side leads into an ante-room where visitors are detained until the great man wishes to see them . Mortimer , the Beau 's valet and really confidential servant , is discovered sitting on sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has evidently been asleep . It is about noon . Mortimer removes handkerchief , yawns and speaks . Mortimer . Mortimer Up till four this morning ! It was pretty lively at the club last night , but I have lost all my beauty sleep to pay for it . I do n't know how much longer we will be able to continue this style of living . Our nerves will give out if our credit does n't . Mr. Brummell only turned over twice and then took to his chocolate . That means he will only be half an hour at his bath  --  time for a nap . Replaces handkerchief . Enter Simpson through door from ante-room . Simpson is the regulation footman , with powdered hair and livery . Simpson . SimpsonAt Left . Mr. Mortimer , sir , Mr. Abrahams has just called . He particularly wishes to see you , sir . Going toward Mortimer . Mortimer . Mortimer Starting and removing handkerchief . Hang Abrahams , what 's he after ? Dear me ! It ca n't be that he thinks of collecting those I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson Who has a great respect for Mortimer . Very deferentially . Been losing again , sir ? Mortimer . Mortimer Loftily . Yes , Simpson , pretty high stakes last night , and one must play , you know . Simpson . Simpson Mr. Mortimer , sir , you could n't propose me in your club , could you , sir ? Mortimer . Mortimer Haughtily and then more kindly , as he sees Simpson 's downcast face . No , Simpson , not in your present position , you know ; but if you should ever raise yourself , depend upon me to use all my influence for you . Simpson . Simpson Gratefully . Oh , thank you , sir , I 'm sure , going but what about Mr. Abrahams , sir ? Mortimer . Mortimer Seating himself . Oh , damn Abrahams ! Enter Abrahams from ante-room , hat and cane in hand . Abrahams is the typical Jew money-lender of the period , exaggerated in dress and manner . Abrahams .

Oh , you have n't a master , have n't you ? Well , now , suppose I was to come down on you with some of your little I. O. U. 's , I wonder then if you 'd have a master . Where 's Mr. Brummell ? Mortimer . Mortimer Mr. Brummell has not yet appeared . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams Sitting down as if to wait . Inform him that Mr. Abrahams wishes to see him . Mortimer . Mortimer Shocked .

I 'm in need of money myself , and I must get it from Mr. Brummell . My creditors are pressing me , and they force me to do the same . Loudly . I regret the necessity , but I am determined upon seeing him . Mortimer . Mortimer Who is so shocked he can hardly speak . Not so loud , Mr. Abrahams , not so loud . If Mr. Brummell were to hear you , he 'd be distressed . Besides , he never tolerates any one who raises his voice unnecessarily . If he should hear you , you might never be paid . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams Aghast at the thought . What ! Mortimer . MortimerHands raised in horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whispering in Mortimer 's ear . Mortimer . Morti mer Looking at Abrahams out of the corner of his eye . Upon my honor , Mr. Brummell was saying only yesterday he thought he would pay Mr. Abrahams . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams A little more calmly . Then why has n't he done so ? Mortimer . Mortimer Mr. Brummell only said it yesterday , and Mr. Brummell never does anything in a hurry . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams Is four years a hurry ? Well , this is the last time that I will be put off . Do you follow me  --  the last time ! And now , when am I to have your little sums ? Mortimer . Mortimer Taking out handkerchief and wiping eyes . Mine ! Oh , I have a wealthy aunt , who is now dying in Clapham , Mr. Abrahams , and I am her sole heir . I fear I must beg you to wait until after her funeral . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams At Left Centre . Really puzzled . It is very strange , a very large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do n't die . They all appear to be affected with a most lingering sickness . However , Mr. Brummell has no such relative , and I believe , on consideration , that I will wait for him this morning . Sits in chair by table . Mortimer . Morti mer Who is now determined to get rid of him , crossing to Abrahams . No , really , Mr. Abrahams , you must go . Mr. Brummell would not see you until his toilet is completed ; and , indeed , if he would , he could transact no business in dshabille . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams In what ? Jumps up . Oh , very well , very well ; but advise him this is the last time I will be dismissed without seeing him . The next time I call , I will see him whether he is in desh  --  desh  --  or nothing . I will have my money . I will have my money . All the while he is saying this , Mortimer is pushing him gently of through the ante-room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Right Centre , and turns away with a sigh of relief as Simpson enters very hurriedly . Simpson . Simpson Mr. Mortimer , sir , there are a number of people waiting with their accounts to see Mr. Brummell . What shall I say , sir ? Mortimer . Mortimer Resignedly . Get a list of their names , Simpson , and tell them I 'll call around and see them to-day . Simpson . Simpson Very well , sir . Exit Simpson through ante-room . A murmur of voices is heard there . Mortimer . Mortimer Affairs are very shaky . It was only three days since Abrahams called . According to this he will return again to-morrow . Sits in chair in front of dressing-case , makes himself comfortable , and is about to fall asleep when Kathleen appears at door and peeps in . Kathleen . KathleenIn door at Left . She is Mariana 's Irish maid , very pretty and piquant . Pst ! Pst ! Mortimer starts and listens , then composes himself for another nap . Kathleen . Kathleen Pst ! Pst ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily last night , but I hardly thought it affected me . Kathleen . Kathleen Hello ! Mortimer . MortimerRising . Who is it ? What is it ? Kathleen . Kathleen Still in door . With pretty impatience . Is it all right ,  --  can I come in ? Mortimer . Morti mer Laughingly . Look here , Kathleen , are you going to indulge in that sort of thing when we are married ? Kathleen . Kathleen Can I come in ? Comes in a few steps . Mortimer . Mortimer Crossing to Centre . Yes , it 's all right now . Mr. Brummell is finishing the first part of his toilet ; he wo n't be out for some time yet . Well , what do you want , you little minx ? Chucks her under chin . Kathleen . KathleenTossing her head . Minx , indeed ! Crossing to Right . I dropped in to find out what 's your intentions . Mr. Sheridan 's gentleman has become very pressing in his , and wo n't be held off much longer . Now , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a breaking off , Mr. Mortimer ? Am I to be worn in your coat like a flower and thrown aside when I 'm withered , or am I to be pressed in the album of your affections , Mr. Mortimer ? I own there is an air about Mr. Brummell , and I should not be averse to a connection with the family . Quite seriously . Mortimer . M ortimer Just as seriously . And I mean you shall have it , Kathleen , for you would become our position . But the fact is , I ca n't afford to marry while Mr. Brummell 's money matters are so bad . I tell you his social position is like a halo ,  --  it is glory all round him , but there 's a hollow in the middle . Kathleen . Kathleen With a sudden thought . Mr. Mortimer ! We must marry Mr. Brummell ! First , we must procure a list of the heiresses . Mortimer . MortimerSlyly . I understand there is a heap of money in your family . Kathleen . Kathleen Dubiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections are already engaged . Mortimer . Morti mer Indeed , to whom ? Kathleen . Kathleen That 's what I ca n't find out . The divvle never signs any of his letters . I can promise you one thing , he is n't very high , and Miss Mariana 's father has forbid him the house , and swears she sha n't have him . Mr. Vincent , oh , ho ! he 's all for position and fashion . Mortimer . MortimerPuts arm around her waist and they walk up and down . Then Mr. Vincent would be glad to marry her to Mr. Brummell . We 'll enlist him on our side . Now there are two difficulties with Mr. Brummell  --  first , he is , just at present , very friendly with Mrs. St. Aubyn . Still , I think I can get him out of that predicament , and then you see Mr. Brummell is so demmed particular ,  --  the young lady must be correct to a hair in every respect  --  Kathleen . KathleenAffectedly . Lord , Mr. Morty , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her service ? And what 's the matter with me ? She 's a very much a la mud and crosses to mirror at Right correct in every particular . Mr. Mortimer , do you think you are as becoming to me as Mr. Sheridan 's gentleman ? Beckoning to him , he comes up and looks over her shoulder in the glass . Mortimer . Mortimer Putting his arm around her and leading her away from mirror . Look here , Kathleen , no tricks ; and what are you doing out at this time of day ? Kathleen . Kathleen Walking to and fro with Mortimer . Why , Miss Mariana sent me over an hour back with this letter holding up letter for her young gentleman . They correspond through me ; faith , I 'm turned into a regular post-bag . But I 'm afraid I 've missed him this time . Mortimer . Morti mer Laughingly . You will have to miss him quite regularly when we begin to break it off between your young mistress and her lover , and supplant him with my gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mortimer ! Mortimer !

Mortimer nods . Could n't I see him ? Mortimer . Mortimer With horror . What ! Before he 's finished ? Gracious Heavens ! No ! Kathleen . Kathleen Crossing to door of ante-room . Well , I am going . I 'm loath to leave ye ; goody-by  --  be faithful . Throws kiss . Exit Kathleen . Enter Beau from door into bedroom . He enters slowly as though it were too much trouble to come in . He is dressed in a yellow brocaded dressing-gown , tied with a heavy yellow cord . It is long , so that only his patent leather pumps with silver buckles show , with just a glimpse of brown and yellow striped socks . He crosses at once to the dressing-table without paying any attention to Mortimer , who bows deferentially and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beau Brummell Oh , go to the devil . Mortimer . Mortimer To himself . Mr. Brummell is in a bad temper this morning . Beau . Beau Brummell Seating himself at dressing-table . Mortimer , is the sun shining ? Mortimer .

Beau Brummell Simply looks at it and motions it away ; exit Simpson . Any gossip , Mortimer ? Has taken up hand-glass , and then gently smooths his eyebrows . Mortimer . Mortim er None of any account , sir . The Dowager Lady Slopington ran off yesterday with young Philip Pettibone . Beau . Beau Brummell Now manicuring his nails .

And who has called ? Mortimer . Mortimer Crosses to small table and looks over cards . Oh , nobody , sir . To be sure there has been the usual crowd of people . The Honorable Mrs. Donner came for your subscription to the town charities , and I gave her all you could spare , sir . Mr. Cecil Serious , the poet , called for permission to inscribe your name under the dedication of his new volume of verses . Lord Cowden came to know if your influence might still be used in the support of his party in the coming elections . Beau . Beau Brummell Still occupied with his toilet .

I would n't care to make a loan for life and give myself as security . Mortimer . Morti mer Mr. Brummell , sir , have you ever observed Miss Mariana Vincent ? Beau . Beau Brummell Thoughtfully . Yes , I have noticed her in the Mall , and I must confess it was to admire her ; her person is perfect . Is her matrimonial figure as good ? Mortimer . Mortimer I believe it is sixty thousand pounds , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Oh , dear ! Mortimer . Mortimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little to the wife of Mr. Brummell . Beau . Beau Brummell Musingly . Yes , it 's a very paltry sum , and Mrs. St. Aubyn  --  Mortimer . MortimerInsinuatingly . If you could present her to the Prince , Mr. Brummell , do n't you think a Platonic friendship might spring up there ? Beau . Beau Brummell As though thinking aloud . She is ambitious , but she is clever and would never forgive a slight . She is a good hater , and if she thought she were being put upon one side , she would make a sly enemy . Well  --  we shall see . Mortimer , write a letter to Mr. Vincent  --  make my proposal for his daughter 's hand . Be mindful of your language and careful to accomplish it in the most elegant manner , and request an immediate reply . Mortimer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Simpson . Simpson Enters at Left from ante-room . Mr. Reginald Courtenay , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Yes , you may bid him come in here . Reginald comes rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad of twenty , dressed simply , in great contrast to Beau 's gorgeous attire . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Speaks very loud . Ah ! Mortimer . Crossing to Beau , after placing hat and cane on table , with hand extended . Good morning , Uncle Beau ! Beau . Beau Brummell Reginald ! You are evidently laboring under the impression that I am a great distance off . Mortimer goes into bedroom . Reginald . Reg inal Courtenay In a much lower tone . I beg your pardon , Uncle Beau . Bows . Good morning . Hand extended . Beau . Beau Brummell No , I do n't think I will shake hands ; men shake hands much too often , especially in warm weather . A glance of the eye , Reginald  --  a glance of the eye ! Did it ever occur to you , Reginald , how thoughtful our Creator was , in giving us bodies , to give them to us naked , so that we could dress and ornament them as we choose ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay It had not occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I suppose not . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay I trust you are well this morning ? Beau . Beau Brummell No , I 've contracted a cold  --  I suppose everybody will have a cold now . I left my carriage on the way to the Pavilion last night , and the wretch of a landlord put me into the same room with a damp stranger . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Goes up , sits on settee at Right , with a change of tone and manner . Uncle , I want your advice and help . Beau . Beau Brummell Goes to Reginald , and puts his hand on his shoulder and speaks with real affection . All the advice I have is yours . Reginald , my boy , I trust you have n't gotten yourself into difficulties . You are the one creature in the world whom I love , and I think it would break my heart to see you in any trouble from which I could not free you . Your mother , my boy , was a mother to me for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend I ever had . She saw the heart that beat beneath the waistcoat . Moreover , she helped me always  --  in every way ; if it had not been for her , perhaps even now , I might be in some smoky office in the city  --  that undiscovered country from whose bourn no social traveler ever returns . Crosses back to dressing-table . What is it , Reginald ? If you are in debt , I will give you a letter to Mr. Abrahams . If you are in the blue-devils , I will give you one to Mrs. St. Aubyn . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Rises and comes down to Beau . I am in neither , Uncle Beau ; I am in love . Beau . Beau Brummell Dear me , that 's worse than either . How do you know you are ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Why  --  well  --  I feel it here ! Indicating heart . I live only when she is present , and merely exist when away from her . Beau . Beau Brummell Staring at him through his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is your fair one possible ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Indignantly . If you mean is she a gentlewoman , she is , and besides , young and beautiful  --  and  --  Beau . Beau Brummell At Right . Of course , she would be . But does she return your passion ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay She loves me , Uncle . Beau . Beau Brummell Of course , she would  --  but  --  Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Her father is opposed to me . He has forbidden our seeing each other ; our meetings have to be clandestine , and our mutual correspondence is carried on through her maid . He wishes a title for his daughter . He is rich and seeks only position in the world of society , while she , ah ! she cares nothing for it  --  only  --  for  --  me . Beau . Beau Brummell Looking at him through glass . Reginald , do you know I think you are more conceited than I am . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay At Center . Oh , no ! Bowing .

You shall have the girl if I have to plead for you myself . But that will not be necessary . No , I will give you social distinction and prominence much more easily . Come for me in a little while , and I 'll walk along the Mall with you to White 's . Yes , and be seen with you at the Club window a few moments . Now , my dear boy , can anybody possibly do anything more for you ? With absolute conviction . Reginald . Regi nal Courtenay Pleased . No , Uncle . Turning to go . Yes , Uncle  --  you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse ; will you lend me a couple of crowns to take a chair with ? I 've missed an appointment with the maid , and I wish to return to the Park in a hurry . Beau . Beau Brummell Reginald , you know I never use silver , it 's so excessively dirty and heavy . Ask Mortimer for a couple of guineas as you go out . Reginald starts to go . By the way , Reginald , it is just possible that I may enter into the golden bands myself . I am thinking somewhat of a marriage with a certain young lady whose charms , strange to say , very much resemble those you would have described had I permitted you to inflict me . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Laughing . You marry ! Uncle ! You ! Your wit makes me laugh in spite of my dolours . Imagine the great Beau Brummell married ! Why , Uncle , your children would be little Rosettes . Beau . Beau Brummell Wincing . Reginald , never be guilty of a pun ; it is excessively vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Going to Beau and offering hand quickly . Then , Uncle , I am glad for you . Beau . Beau Brummell Starts , looks at hand with eye-glass . Dear me , what 's that ? Oh , dear , no , Reginald  --  a glance of the eye . Reginald drops hand . A glance of the eye ! My boy , you look so like your mother  --  God bless you ! Reginald goes to table at Left for hat and stick . Beau . Beau Brummell You will return ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Boisterously , crossing to door at Left . Yes , shortly . Beau . Beau Brummell Again shocked at his loud tone . Reginald ! Reginald stops , returns a step or two , looks at Beau as if to say , " What is it ? " Beau bows very politely . Reginald remembers he had forgotten himself for a minute , bows , places hat on his head , as he turns , and exits less boisterously . Simpson . Sim pson Enters from ante-room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beau Brummell Yes , you can let him in here . Simpson . Simpson Exits and returns , ushering in Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams , sir . Abrahams .

Beau Brummell dancing at him through his glass . Ah  --  Abrahams  --  ah , yes ! So you are , so you are . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams Insinuatingly . I thought it was likely , sir , that you wished to make a few payments . Beau . Beau Brummell Dryly . I think that 's wrong , Abrahams ; do you know , I fear you will have to guess again . Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams With indignation . Well now , really , Mr. Brummell , I hope you do n't want to raise another loan . Beau . Beau Brummell Pleased that he has surmised it . I believe that 's right , Abrahams ; second thoughts seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very loudly .

Enter footman . Stands below door . Beau . Beau Brummell Without looking at him . Mortimer , which one is it ? Mortimer . Mortimer Who had come in from bedroom . Bendon , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell At Right . Graciously . Very well , Bendon . Footman . Prince 's Footman With great respect . Mr. Brummell , sir , His Royal Highness wishes to know if you will be at home this afternoon at four o'clock . If so , he will call upon you to make arrangements for the dance at Carlton House . Beau . Beau Brummell At what o'clock did you say , Bendon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Say to His Royal Highness to make it half-past four o'clock . Exit footman at Left , followed by Simpson . Abrahams is overcome with wonder at this , and looks at Mortimer , who draws himself up proudly . Beau . Beau Brummell As if recollecting his presence . You were saying , Mr. Abrahams , that you could not possibly  --  Abrahams . Mr. Abrahams Bowing , changing attitude and tone . H 'm , ach  --  hem  --  that I should be very glad  --  though I am just now rather pressed myself . How much did you say , sir ? Beau . Beau Brummell How much did I say , Mortimer ? Enter Reginald , same door . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Boisterously rushing to Beau , Left Centre . Am I in good time , Uncle ? Beau . Beau Brummell Startled .

I beg your pardon , Uncle Beau . Are you busy ? Beau . Beau Brummell As if startled . I beg your pardon  --  Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Are you busy ? Beau . Beau Brummell Busy ! Ugh ! Never employ that term with me . No gentleman is ever busy . Insects and city people are busy . This  --  ah  --  person has come to ask my assistance in some little financial matters , and I think I 've rather promised to oblige him . Mortimer , go with this  --  ah  --  ah  --  person . You go with my valet . Abrahams bows and bows . Yes , quite so , quite so . Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bowing all the time . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Gloomily sitting on sofa . I was too late ; I missed her . Beau . Beau Brummell Do n't be gloomy , Reginald , or I shall not be able to walk with you . Nothing is more conspicuous than melancholy . Mortimer returns  --  coughs . Beau . Beau Brummell Mortimer , are you coughing ? Mortimer . MortimerApologetically . Yes , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell At Right . Well , I wish you would n't . You wish to speak with me ? Mortimer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Beau crosses , bowing in apology as he passes Reginald . Mr. Brummell , sir , everything is arranged satisfactorily , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Did you send for the new tailor , what 's his name , to come this afternoon ? Mortimer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell And have you written the letter to Mr. Vincent ?

Exit Beau and Reginald into bedroom . Enter Kathleen from ante-room . Kathleen . Kathl een La ! I must come in for a minute . I missed my young gentleman in the Park , and I ventured back to ask how we are to discover who he is . That 's what we must do somehow , but how ? Reginald enters from bedroom . Reginald . Reg inal Courtenay Coming down . Mr. Brummell 's snuff-box , Mortimer . Reginald and Kathleen recognize each other . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Her maid ! Kathleen . Kathleen To Mortimer . Oh , Lord ! The very young gentleman himself . Mortimer . Mortimer What ! Reginald . Reginal Courtenay At Left . Suspiciously . What are you doing here ? Kathleen . Kathleen At Centre .

Mortimer stands at window after drawing curtain . Reginald crosses to table at Left Centre , and stands back of same . Enter Beau from bedroom . Beau . Beau Brummell At Centre door . Mortimer , what was that extraordinary commotion ? Mortimer . MortimerAt Right , at window , innocently . What commotion , sir ? Beau . Beau Brummell Standing in doorway . Mortimer , do n't be an echo ; how often have I told you that servants are born to answer questions , not to ask them ? I believe you said the sun was shining ? Crosses to window . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Very loud , stopping him . Uncle Beau , your snuff-box . Offering box . Beau . Beau Brummell At Centre . Starts . Ah ! I knew I lacked something ; I perceived I had on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dear me , yes , it was my snuff-box  --  thank you , thank you . He does not take snuff-box . He is now fully dressed  --  long brown trousers , fitting very closely around the leg and buttoned around the ankle , a yellow brocaded waistcoat , brown coat , ruffled shirt with neckerchief , fob with many seals . He crosses to dressing-table and arranges flowers  --  three yellow roses  --  in his coat . Mortimer has crossed to table and stands holding hat , gloves and stick . Reginald has the snuff-box . Beau turns from dressing-table , comes to the Centre . Reginald offers him the snuff-box open . Beau takes a pinch with courteous nod of head . Reginald takes pinch , closes box , hands it to Beau , who holds it in hand . Mortimer then hands him gloves . Beau arranges them in hand very precisely . Mortimer then hands stick . Beau puts this in just right position . Mortimer then hands hat . Beau takes it , is about to put it on , then looks at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but just an expression of complete astonishment . Mortimer , very puzzled , takes it and then sees that he has handed it with the wrong side to put on . Bows very low with an expression of great chagrin . Turns it and hands it to Beau . Beau takes it , walks to mirror , raises it two or three times until he has it at just the right angle , then puts it on . Turns to Reginald . Beau . Beau Brummell And now , Reginald , I 'll make your fortune for you . I 'll walk down the Mall with you to White 's . Walks to door , followed by Reginald , as The Curtain Falls THE FIRST ACT Scene Two The Beau 's reception-room . A small room , furnished in chintz . Chippendale sofa at the Right . Large entrance at back with red striped chintz curtains . Palms in window . A table on the Left holds a standing memorandum tablet . Small arm-chair back of sofa . Two or three other chairs scattered around the room . A door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain is standing by table , looking at the memorandum tablet through his eye-glass . He is dressed as in Scene One . Simpson draws the curtains at the back , and announces : Simpson . Simpson Mrs. St. Aubyn , sir ! Simpson then leaves the curtains drawn and goes out . Beau turns and bows . Beau . Beau Brummell Punctual as the day , and twice as welcome . Mrs. St. Aubyn has sailed into the room with an air that plainly says , " You and I are to settle some important things to-day " She is a very handsome woman of about thirty , beautifully dressed , and showing in every look and motion the woman accustomed to homage and command . She carries a fan , which she uses to emphasize all her remarks . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn You received my letter ? Beau . Beau Brummell With another bow . And your ambrosial lock of hair . Mrs. St. Aubyn is at first offended , and then laughs and sits on sofa . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not such a fool . Beau is not at all taken aback by the mistake he has made . Beau . Beau Brummell Ah , no , I believe I am mistaken ; but , my dear Horatia , one gets things of this sort so mixed ; and I plead in extenuation that the wish was father to the thought . Beau sits in chair near table . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Have you missed me really these last two days ? Where have you been ? It 's been so dull without you , I vow , I could almost have married again . Leans forward and speaks very confidentially . Now , I want you to do me a favor , will you ? Beau . Beau Brummell Whisper it and it is done . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Well , then , I will whisper . I want you to get me a card to the dance at Carlton House . Beau . Beau Brummell The very privilege that I have looked forward to . I desire to present you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An unselfish pleasure , you would say , but I love you too well , my dear Horatia , not to sacrifice myself to your greatest opportunity . During this speech , Mrs. St. Aubyn has listened with a slight cynical smile , and now with an air of finality says : Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn I would not give up your devotion altogether  --  even for the Prince 's . With great empressement . Beau . Beau Brummell Take both . Mine you will always have . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Yet I think my devotion for you overbalances yours . Beau . Beau Brummell My dear madam , you are too good . Do you know , I fear you will die young ? Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn With an air of giving up this contest of wits . Oh , the deuce take your fine phrases ! If I thought I 'd a rival , I 'd let the Prince flit somewhere else . You 're clever and the Prince is n't . He 'll be very dull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , quickly as she sees an almost imperceptible shrug of Beau 's shoulder it is n't that I 'm afraid for my reputation  --  that was damned long ago . But I 've certain notions of self-respect which are n't in the fashion and which men do n't seem to understand . Beau . Beau Brummell Very quietly . Marry him ! Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn With real astonishment . What ! Beau . Beau Brummell Taking out snuff-box and taking snuff . Marry him . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn It is impossible ! Beau . Beau Brummell With you all things are possible . Mrs. St. Aubyn laughs nervously and steals a surreptitious look at herself in a little mirror in her fan . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn My dear Beau , I wish you 'd make plain sense instead of pretty sentences . What advantages have I to recommend me ? Beau . Beau Brummell I will ask Mortimer to make out a list , but I may name one only  --  which is all-sufficient . For the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aubyn rises with a laugh . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Oh , the conceit of the man ! But tell me what style of woman is the Prince caught by ? Beau rising also . Beau . Beau Brummell To be perfectly frank with you , the Prince admires the fashion , and I  --  have made you the fashion . I am expecting him here this afternoon . Mrs. St. Aubyn gives a shriek of dismay . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Who ? The Prince ! Gracious , why did n't you tell me ? Runs to cheval-glass . How am I looking ? There , there , you need n't answer ; I know it is one of my bad days . Beau is really very much upset by this rushing around and rapid talking . Speaks as though quite overcome . Beau . Beau Brummell My dear Horatia , I beg of you not to rattle on so ; you 've no idea how you fatigue me . Simpson enters at back and announces : Simpson . Simpson The Duchess of Leamington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. St. Aubyn says to herself , as she comes down to chair at right of sofa : Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Damme , that woman . The Duchess and Mr. Sheridan enter at back . The Duchess is a very much painted and bewigged old young woman , dressed in a very light flowered gown , with a very large hat . Sheridan is still handsome , but no longer young , dressed in black silk knee-breeches , black coat and stockings ; he wears the powdered wig instead of short hair like Beau 's . The Duchess makes low curtsy to Beau , who bows . Beau . Beau Brummell Ah , Duchess , what happy accident ! Has your carriage broken down at my door , or do you come out of your own sweet charity ? We were just speaking of you . I said you were the best-dressed woman in London , but Mrs. St. Aubyn did not seem to agree with me . To Sheridan . How do you do , Sherry ? Nods to Sheridan and , crossing to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Duchess of Leamington As though noticing Mrs. St. Aubyn for the first time , says superciliously : How d'ye do ? Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Haughtily . Mr. Brummell pleases to be witty at my expense , Duchess . Then to herself . I must be on my guard . I do n't understand Beau . The Duchess seats herself on sofa . Mrs. St. Aubyn is sitting in chair just below sofa . Beau is sitting at chair near table , and Sheridan is still standing . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Mr. Sheridan and I thought we 'd come to tell you the news . We knew you were never up till noon , and thought you might want to hear what 's going on . Sheridan now brings down chair from the back , and sits about Centre . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan And when we were nearly here we remembered that really there was nothing to tell . There seems to be a lamentable dearth of scandal and gossip nowadays . I do n't know what we are coming to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beau Brummell Sherry , I hear the " School for Scandal " is to be revived . It returns to us every year like Spring and the influenza . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Regretfully . Yes , but it wo n't be played as it used to be . Beau . Beau Brummell Thankfully . No , I hope not . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Dear me , only think of Miss Motional playing Lady Teazle now , at her age ! Why is it that pass people are always so anxious to act ? With a little affected giggle . I wonder you do n't go on the stage , Mrs. St. Aubyn ? Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn With great sweetness . I never experienced a scandal of sufficient clat to warrant such a step . But you , Duchess , what a success you would have ! Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Spiteful creature ! Beau . Beau Brummell How very severe  --  Simpson enters at back , and announces : Simpson . Simpson His Royal Highness , the Prince Regent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not remove his hat . All rise . Duchess and Mrs. St. Aubyn curtsy . Sheridan bows very low and Beau bows rather condescendingly . Prince . The Prince of Wales Ah , Beau , good morning . Beau . Beau Brummell This is very good of you , sir . The Duchess , I am sure , is a welcome vision . Sherry you know , and you have heard  --  surely you have heard of the fascinating Mrs. St. Aubyn . Prince . The Prince of Wales But never have seen half enough . Beau . Beau Brummell Where will you put yourself , sir ? Prince . The Prince of Wales Very emphatically says as he crosses to sofa : Damme , here . He sits on sofa and makes a motion with his hand , inviting Mrs. St. Aubyn to sit beside him . To do this , Mrs. St. Aubyn has to cross in front of the Duchess , which she does with a look of triumph , while the Duchess , in moving to Mrs. St. Aubyn 's vacated seat , turns up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't last long .

Mrs. St. Aubyn I believe , sir , Mr. Sheridan is thinking of a new play . Prince . The Prince of Wales Do n't you put me in , Sherry , or , if you do , mind you make me thin . A fat man played me in the pantomime t' other night , and damme , I had him locked up . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan With great deference . ' T was a libel , sir , a gross libel . Prince . The Prince of Wales I heard , Beau , from my tailor , this morning , that you had gotten up something new in trousers . Why the deuce have n't you told me ? Duchess .

You must excuse me , Duchess ; I have contracted a cold . Prince . The Prince of Wales I 'll tell you , Duchess ; they 're long trousers which are slit so pointing with his cane to his own leg at the bottom , and then buttoned tight . Very odd , you see , and striking . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington It might be too striking ; do n't you think it depends on the  --  eh  --  eh  --  circumstances ? She draws her skirt up very slightly , and strikes her leg with her fan . Prince .

Beau Brummell Mrs. St. Aubyn means they are little trifles not worth mentioning . Prince . The Prince of Wales Now , I object . Besides , I 've something else to talk about . What think you , Beau , of Tuesday week for the dance at Carlton House ? Beau rises my slowly , takes tablet , looks it over . Beau . Beau Brummell Tuesday , Tuesday  --  yes , I think I might make Tuesday do . Prince rises , and everybody rises . Prince . The Prince of Wales To Mrs. St. Aubyn . You will not forget , then , siren , the opening quadrille with me . May I take you to your chair ? Mrs. St. Aubyn makes him a low curtsy . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own door , instead of at Mr. Brummell 's . Beau . Beau Brummell That 's very good , very good . Mrs. St. Aubyn curtsies with a look of triumph to the Duchess . The Prince holds out his hand : She places her hand lightly on his , curtsies low to Beau , and retires up to the Centre door , while the Prince is making his adieus , which he does by simply nodding to the Duchess and Sheridan , most graciously nodding to Beau ; and then he takes Mrs. St. Aubyn 's hand again and they go off chattering . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Who has witnessed this with ill-concealed envy . Now , Mr. Brummell , promise me you 'll bow to me at the play to-night . You bowed to Lady Farthingale last week Thursday , and she has given herself airs ever since . Beau . Beau Brummell After the play , Duchess , after the play . If I looked at you once during the play , I could never bend my attention again to the players . Duchess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that , Mr. Brummell , would damn the play . Beau . Beau Brummell Yes , I should n't wonder if it did . It would n't be the first play I 've damned . Duchess curtsies , Sheridan bows , and they go off at Centre door . Beau takes up memorandum tablet and goes toward door , Left , reading as he goes . Let me see  --  Thursday , lunch with Lord and Lady Pleasant , then on to Mrs. Hearsays  --  pour passer le temps . Dinner with the Dowager Countess of Alimony , dance at Gordon House , then to the Rag , then to the Raleigh , then to Vauxhall . Beau goes out . Simpson enters at Centre door , showing in Mr. Vincent . Vincent is a stout , red-faced man , bluff manner , dressed rather loudly , with brown bob-wig , and he drops his h 's . Simpson . Simpson Whom shall I say , sir ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent Never mind introducing me . I 'll introduce myself  --  tell him a gentleman wishes to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson . Simpson Yes , sir . Simpson goes out at Left door with a look of disdain at Vincent . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Who is in a state of great excitement .

But , really , now I 'm ' ere , I 'm not sure I 've done the right thing . It 's perfectly absurd , ridiculous , but I 'm slightly nervous . I , the most successful cloth merchant of the day  --  unreasonable ! I must appear at my ease or I shall fail to make an impression . Let me see , what shall I say when , he comes in ?

Beau Brummell Sunday after service , lunch with Lady Sybilla  --  Sybilla ! She is " un tant soit peu pass , " but there was a time , there was a time , when poor Sybilla and I  --  Vincent 's bowings and movements now attract Beau 's attention , and he looks at him through eye-glass . Beau . Beau Brummell To himself . Ah , yes , the new tailor . Aloud . I will speak with you presently . I am somewhat occupied just now . Resumes soliloquy .

Then on to Lady Ancient 's  --  very tedious , but I must go or the poor woman 's rooms would be quite vacant . Vincent has again resumed his bowing and clasping and unclasping his hands . Beau . Beau Brummell Looks at him . Did you hear what I observed ? Would you be kind enough not to wobble about in that way , and please do not wash your hands incessantly with imaginary soap , or chassez about in that manner ? You have no idea how you distress me . Vincent never stops , growing more and more nervous . How very extraordinary ; he does not seem to be able to stop . Perhaps he is suffering with St. Vitus 's dance . I shall never be able to employ a person so afflicted . Well , I wo n't dismiss him at once . I 'll turn my back on him so I ca n't see him . Beau turns his back to Vincent . Let me see , where was I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I must go or the poor woman 's rooms will be quite empty ; then on to the club . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Very deprecatingly . But , sir  --  Beau . Beau Brummell I 'll speak with you presently . I am somewhat occupied just now , and , although my back is turned , I can feel you are wobbling about . To himself . I think I might venture to play again with my present prospects , Monday  --  Monday  --  Vincent . Mar iana Vincent Who is now getting restive , and realizes he is being treated badly . But !  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Please do not say " but " again . Vincent . Mariana Vincent My lord !  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Nothing so commonplace . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Sir  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Very well , I suppose I had better speak with him  --  the sooner it is over the better . You 've come to see me about my suit , I suppose . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Yes , the honor it confers upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's affected his head . Does your daughter sew , also ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent Surprised . Oh , beautifully , Mr. Brummell , but  --  Beau . Beau Brummell I must ask you to omit your " buts . " Now , if you will stand perfectly still for a few moments , I will endeavor to ask you one or two questions ; but you must try to stand still , and if you try very hard , you may succeed . But do try  --  there 's a good man  --  try , try , try again . Aside . I 'm so sorry for him . He must suffer so . Well , I wo n't look at him . Turns away and sits down at table . During all this time Vincent has been bowing , trying to stand still , but not succeeding , owing to his great embarrassment . Now , have you any new cloths ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent My dear sir , I was not aware that you were at all interested in cloths . Looks around for a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Beau . Beau Brummell He 's violent  --  he 's going to attack me . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Bringing down the chair near to Beau . Yes , there are some very fine new cloths . Now , if you 'll allow me  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Certainly not , sir ; certainly not . Aside . Poor man , I suppose he never waited upon any one before . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Can now stand it no longer , and rises . This is too much . ' T is outrageous . I 'll not stand it , sir . I am a gentleman , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Then why do n't you behave like one ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent I 've come here  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Of course , you 've come here , that 's very evident . You 've come in answer to my message , have n't you ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent Yes , sir , I 've come in answer to your message asking for my daughter 's ' and  --  Beau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent My daughter 's ' and  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Your daughter 's hand ? It begins to dawn upon him . I beg your pardon . Vincent . Mariana Vincent I came to accept your offer of marriage , but I 've altered my intention . Beau . Beau Brummell Dear me , you are  --  Vincent . Mariana Vincent Mr. Holiver Vincent , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Aside . And I thought he was the tailor ! Aloud . A thousand apologies ; wo n't you be seated ? I was very much preoccupied . I ask you a thousand pardons  --  but Vincent has begun to bow and wobble again what can you expect if you will wobble about in that manner , my dear Sir Oliver ! Vincent , indignant , again is soothed by title . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Not Sir Holiver yet . Mr. Holiver  --  Mr. Holiver Vincent , at your service . Beau . Beau Brummell I only regret that you did not say so before . Simpson enters . Simpson . S impson Sir , the Duke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take mutton with him to-night ? Beau looks at Vincent , who looks pleadingly at him , as much as to say , " Dine with me . " Beau . Beau Brummell Send my polite regrets to his Royal Highness and say , I dine to-night with Mr. Oliver Vincent . Simpson exits at Centre door . Beau offers his snuff-box to Vincent , who takes a pinch and snuffs it with a loud , disagreeable noise , which shocks Beau unspeakably. the curtain falls THE SECOND ACT The ballroom at Carlton House , a large , stately room hung in yellow damask  --  yellow damask furniture . On the Right , a door leading into reception room . On the Left are three curtained recesses . At the back a large doorway extends the whole width of room ; it is curtained with yellow brocade curtains , which are looped back , showing a long hall hung with mirrors ; it leads to supper room . On the stage , at rise of curtain , is the Prince , standing near the Centre , talking to Mrs. St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue ribbon of the Garter ; Mrs. St. Aubyn in elaborate evening dress . Sheridan , the Duchess of Leamington , Lady Farthingale , Lord Manly and other guests are standing at back . Prince . The Prince of Wales A little impatiently , as though he had been welcoming guests until tired . Any one else , damme ; I 'm ready to dance . Servant enters from the door on the Right . Servant . Servant Mr. Brummell , Mr. Oliver Vincent , Miss Vincent . Servant steps to one side of door as Mr. Brummell comes in with Mariana , her hand resting lightly on his . The Duchess then steps forward and takes Mariana 's hand . Mr. Brummell steps back to the side of Vincent , who has followed them on . The Duchess leads Mariana to the Prince . While this is going on , Mrs. St. Aubyn , who has stared in amazement , says : Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn What 's this presentation for ; does it mean money for the Duchess ? She does not need it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your Royal Highness  --  Miss Vincent . Both curtsy to the Prince . Prince . The Prince of Wales This places me deeper than ever in Mr. Brummell 's debt . The Duchess and Mariana back away and retire to the back of room , where they are joined by Sheridan . Beau now advances to the Prince , closely followed by Vincent , who is greatly excited . Beau . Beau Brummell Sir , I have the honor to present my friend , Mr. Oliver Vincent . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Aside . It 's Mr. Brummell who is at the bottom of this . I think I begin to see . Prince . The Prince of Wales Mr. Vincent ? Is this the Mr. Vincent , of the city ? For , egad , sir , I am pleased  --  Vincent . Mariana Vincent Greatly embarrassed . Your Highness , sir , the honor is all mine , ah , all mine , Your Highness , thank you for your cordiality , Your Highness . Offers the Prince his hand . Beau quietly throws it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering his retreat , as it were , by his own self-possession and the look of humorous appeal which he gives to the Prince . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Your Royal Highness , what does Beau mean ? Really , sir , I think you take too much from him . They are from the city , these Vincents ; you can see its dust on their feet . Prince . The Prince of Wales Chuckling at his own wit . Yes , damme , madam ; but it 's gold dust . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn With a slight smile , such as an offended goddess might give . Pray , sir , let us have the dance now . The Prince offers her his hand and they take their places at the head of the set . Sheridan leads the Duchess to one side . Lord Manly leads Lady Farthingale to the other . Beau . Beau Brummell To Mariana . May I have the delight of leading you out in the dance ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent I fear , Mr. Brummell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beau . Beau Brummell I know you dance well , or I should not have asked you . I have watched you . One must always judge for oneself . He leads Mariana to the head , opposite the Prince . They dance an old-fashioned quadrille , the end of which is a deep curtsy from the ladies and a bow from the men . The Prince then goes up to Centre door , and out through the hall with Mrs. St. Aubyn . Prince . The Prince of Wales Egad ! Poor Beau ! Your charms have made me false to my friend . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Ah ! But I fear Your Royal Highness is fickle , and may be false to me , too . Prince . The Prince of Wales Zounds ! I could only be that by being false to myself . They are now out of sight . The Duchess has joined Beau and Mariana , Lady Farthingale and Lord Manly . The latter couple now curtsy and bow and exit through Centre door , and go down the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives one more clat to dance with Mr. Brummell than to dance with the Prince . Beau . Beau Brummell Quite sincerely . I really think it does . The Duchess and Mr. Sheridan then bow , and also go out at Centre door , meeting Vincent , who bows to them in a most exaggerated way and then comes down toward the Beau and Mariana . Beau bows in courtly fashion and also goes out through Centre door , so Vincent and Mariana are left alone . Mariana is a charming type of a young English girl , dressed in white , her hair in soft ringlets , with a wreath of tiny rosebuds . Vincent . Mariana Vincent This is the proudest moment of my life ! He had heard of me ; he recognized me at once , Mariana . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Quizzically . Of course , papa , he had read your name on his buttons . Vincent . Mariana Vincent You are mistaken , my dear ; I am not a tailor , I am a cloth merchant . Did you notice how cordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff with him , much too stiff , but Mr. Brummell would have it so . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Still trying to make a jest of it . Quite right , papa ; you needed your dignity and His Royal Highness did not . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Think , Mariana , what a difference to-day from yesterday . Yesterday , I was Vincent , of the City  --  to-night , I am Vincent , of the Court . It is a proud position , my dear ; think of it , Holiver Vincent , the Prince 's friend ! No more " The Hoak , the Hash , and the Bonny Hivy Tree . " No more " A Weary Lot Is Thine , Fair Maid . " Imitates the playing of a piano . No more going to sleep after dinner . No , my dear , we 'll read our names every morning , several times over , in the Court Journal . It 'll be a staggerer for your Aunt Jane at ' Oundsditch . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Sadly . I think , for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very happy . And I like the old songs , and I like my old father just as he is . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Pooh ! My child , I am ambitious , and , if you marry the Beau , in a year from now , I may wear a coronet  --  a coronet . Makes a gesture as though placing a coronet on his head . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown , papa , and how much are you going to give for the coronet ? Anybody can buy one nowadays . Give your money for it , by all means  --  but not your daughter 's happiness . Crossing and going up toward Centre as though to end the discussion . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Follows her and speaks pleadingly . Mariana , I have been a kind father to you . My heart is set upon the accomplishment of this thing . You have ever been a dutiful child . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Turning quickly . And you shall ever find me so . But I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide a woman 's choice . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Turns away vexed . Yes , I know  --  but  --  Mariana . Mariana Vincent Still , my affection for you shall largely influence my decision . Go , my ambitious father . Goes to him and puts her hand on his shoulders . I will see what I can do to win the coronet for your head . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Delightedly kisses her forehead . That 's a good child . He goes up and out through Centre door . Mariana . Mariana Vincent If I can only tear the arrow from my heart . Walks slowly up and down . No dream of greatness , no wish even of my father 's , should for one instant weaken my devotion to Reginald if I could believe him true to me . But he has ceased to write ; I hear of him only in social dissipation . He is gay and merry , and Mariana is forgotten . Since I can not be happy , there is only my dear old father to be pleased . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Duchess and Mr. Vincent enter from the Centre door . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington As she comes gaily down . Ma mie , you are very fortunate , I vow  --  you will be the talk of the town to-morrow  --  to have pirouetted with our Beau here . ' T is no small favor , I assure you  --  and one his Beauship has never yet bestowed upon his doting Duchess  --  you naughty , naughty Beau ! Shakes her fan at Beau . And I must say , ma mie , you comported yourself right well , right limber and nimbly for a dbutante . Though I am no bad executante on the tips of my toes myself , i ' faith . Gives a little pas seul . Beau . Beau Brummell Putting up glasses and looking at her critically . Ah , Duchess , all you need is a ballet skirt and a tambourine . But , egad , we forgot the Prince  --  the Merchant Prince  --  we have just left the title ! Permit me , my dear Duchess , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her Grace , the Duchess of Leamington . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington As she curtsies to Vincent , who bows very low . Deuce take me , Mr. Brummell , have you ever known me to refuse a presentation to money ? Beau . Beau Brummell No , my dear Duchess , and I have known you to become very familiar with it at the card-table without even a formal introduction . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Beau , I vow you 're a brute . She crosses to Vincent and they go up a little . Beau . Beau Brummell Crossing to Mariana . You hear that , Mariana . I am a brute , ' t is true , and I am looking forward to a conjunction of Beauty and the Beast . Turning to the Duchess . Duchess , shall Sir Money conduct you to the card-room ? Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Smiling at Vincent . With pleasure , if he 'll stay there with me . Beau . Beau Brummell No fear of that , for your Grace is sure to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leamington Incorrigible ! Come , Mr. Vincent , your arm , your arm ; ' fore Gad , we are routed . Takes Vincent 's arm ; they turn to go . Beau . Beau Brummell Stopping them . One moment , my dear Vincent . Beau bows to Duchess , who joins Mariana , and they stand talking , while Beau speaks to Vincent . My valet has neglected placing my purse in my pocket , and I am going to allow you the privilege of lending me five hundred guineas before you run away with the Duchess . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Heartily . Certainly , my dear Mr. Brummell , certainly , sir , take ten  --  Puts his hand in his pocket . Beau . Beau Brummell With a look of horror . Not here , my good sir , not here  --  in the card-room . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Going up to the Duchess . My arm , madam , my purse and myself are entirely at your service . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Taking his arm . I only need one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite a courtier . Au revoir , Beau . To Mariana , as she waves a kiss . Ma chre ! Curtsies to the Beau , waves her hand airily to Mariana , and goes off with Vincent . Beau . Beau Brummell Your most humble and devoted slave , Duchess . Mariana . Mariana Vincent You do not follow the cards , Mr. Brummell ? Beau . Beau Brummell They are too fickle ; I am always unlucky . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Unlucky at cards , lucky in love  --  Stops abruptly , vexed that she has mentioned the word " love . " Beau . Beau Brummell That is why I am here . Mariana . Mariana Vincent A little coquettishly . Well , what sort of a hand shall I deal you ? Beau . Beau Brummell With great meaning . Yours ! Mariana . Mariana Vincent With equal meaning . Are diamonds trumps ? Beau . Beau Brummell Reproachfully . No . Hearts ! Mariana . Mariana Vincent Lightly . I have n't one in the pack . Beau . Beau Brummell Nay , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is because I have chosen Nature , not Art , to be my mistress . Beau . Beau Brummell By my manners ! I 've a mind to bring Dame Nature into fashion again . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Then there 's not a woman here could show her face . Beau . Beau Brummell But you . And if you would deign to be seen always on my arm  --  Mariana . Mariana Vincent Mercy ! Mr. Brummell , I fear you would wear me as you do your coat , and throw me aside when I 'm wrinkled . Beau . Beau Brummell With a shudder . Do n't mention wrinkles ; they give me the jaundice . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Seriously . I can not but remember that only one short week ago every bench in the Mall , every lady 's tea-table , every entr ' acte of the play was the occasion for reportings of Mr. Brummell 's fancy for the Honorable Mrs. St. Aubyn . Beau . Beau Brummell You can not imagine I have not favored some woman more than others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed our time in laughter , not in loving . Mrs. St. Aubyn , who has entered at back , hears this last remark . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn I fear I am malapropos , but I will be deaf and blind . She comes down the Centre , while Vincent , Sheridan , Lady Farthingale and the Duchess enter also at Centre door . Mariana . Mariana Vincent It would be a pity , madam , to destroy two faculties which serve you to such good purpose . Crosses and passes Mrs. St. Aubyn with a slight bend of her head , and joins Vincent . Beau . Beau Brummell Oh , that 's very good . To Mrs. St. Aubyn , as he crosses to her . Do n't you think that 's very good ? They stand together , apparently talking , Mrs. St. Aubyn very angrily . Vincent . Mariana Vincent To Mariana . A most bewitching woman that , but I 'm sorry she would insist upon hunting Mr. Brummell , for I knew you would n't want to be interrupted . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every other room before this . Mariana and Vincent go out at Centre door , as Lord Manly comes rushing on , almost running into them . Lord Manly . Lord Manly He is a fop of the period , and quite a little the worse for drink . My dear Beau ! My dear Beau ! A little louder . Beau pays no attention to him . My dear Beau ! ! Still louder . Beau finally looks at him . Lord Crawlings is cheating at the card-table . It is a fact ! He has cards up his sleeve . What shall I do ? Beau . Beau Brummell Cheating at the card-table ? Lord Manly . Lord Manly Yes ; he has cards up his sleeve . Beau . Beau Brummell Thoughtfully . Cards up his sleeve ! Lord Manly . Lord Manly Yes . What shall I do ? Beau . Beau Brummell Well , if he has cards up his sleeve , bet on him . Lord Manly . Lord Manly With a blank stare . Oh  --  thank you . He joins Lady Farthingale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stand conversing with other guests . Lady Farthingale . Lady Farthingale If Mr. Brummell marries Miss Vincent , he 'll have no more difficulty in paying for his clothes , though I hear he 's sadly in debt now . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Poor Beau ! He will never be able to forget the old gentleman 's cloth ; it will be like riding to wealth on a clothes-horse . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Who has been looking down the hall . Lord , Mr. Sheridan ! They are starting for supper . You can do as you please , but I want an oyster . Sheridan and Duchess go off at Centre door , followed by Lady Farthingale , Lord Manly and other guests . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn To Beau , who was starting to go . I insist upon a few words with you . Beau . Beau Brummell Your wishes are my commands . He is now standing in the door , Centre , so he can look down the hall . Mrs. St. Aubyn is walking angrily back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself quite de trop when I entered the room a few minutes ago . Beau . Beau Brummell You speak of impossibilities . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Pray , spare me ; I overheard your last speech . Beau . Beau Brummell You mean you listened to what I said . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Well , if I did  --  I begin to see through you now . Beau . Beau Brummell Happy me ! Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Did you think me blind when you presented these Vincents to the Prince ? Beau . Beau Brummell Bowing to some imaginary guests down the hall . How do you do ? Who could think those eyes blind ? Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn You presented me to the Prince , not for my own sake , but for yours . ' T was a pleasant way to be rid of me . Beau . Beau Brummell No way with such a destination could possibly be pleasant . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn You have puffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my affections against your will . Suppose he were to know the truth ? Beau . Beau Brummell Royal personages are so rarely told the truth that if he did hear it he would not recognize it . How do you do ! Again bowing to some imaginary person . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn What would become of his friendship for you , do you think , and what would you do without it ? Beau . Beau Brummell He would have my sincere sympathy . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Suppose I were to inform him ? Beau . Beau Brummell Again bowing . How do you do , my dear Lady Betty ; how do you do ? Yes , presently  --  with great pleasure  --  h 'm . Turning and apparently paying attention to Mrs. St. Aubyn for the first time . My dear Horatia would not be so foolish as to ruin herself . Would the Prince , do you think , still care for you if he thought I no longer admired you ? He affects you now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made you as I made them  --  the Fashion . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Triumphantly . But there 's something that binds one faster to a man than the button of a coat . There is , my dear Beau , such a thing as marriage . Beau . Beau Brummell Oh , yes , to be sure ! There , my dear madam , I bow to your vast experience Mrs. St. Aubyn makes an impatient movement , but , when it comes to a question of the Prince 's wedding coat , I fear you will find the buttons are sewed on with a very light thread . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn There you are wrong . You seem to forget , my dear Beau , that the Prince already dotes on me . We are both playing a little game  --  you and I  --  but I am persuaded I shall win , for I stake on a heart . Sweeps past Beau with a superb gesture , toward the Left . Beau . Beau Brummell Very quietly . Your fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn What will take my knave when the king is out of the pack ? Beau . Beau Brummell Why , then , I think a queen might turn up . Before Mrs. St. Aubyn can crush him with the reply that is on her lips , Vincent enters . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Ah , ' ere you are , my dear Mr. Brummell ; you are losing your supper , and Mrs. St. Aubyn , too , is depriving the feast of its most brilliant hornament . Beau . Beau Brummell Yes , truly , it is too selfish of Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mr. Vincent , Mrs. St. Aubyn must permit you to conduct her to the supper-room . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Sarcastically . Surely , Mr. Vincent did not do me the honor of leaving the table to search me out . Vincent . Mariana Vincent ' Fore Gad , madam , though I did see a vacant seat next His Royal Highness , in truth I came to look for my daughter . Beau . Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaits her next to the Prince to remain vacant . Takes Mrs. St. Aubyn 's hand and hands her with great empressement to Vincent . Meanwhile , Mr. Vincent , I will go through the rooms for your daughter . Mrs. St. Aubyn stops , gives Beau a look , is about to make a scene , then thinks better of it , and lets Vincent lead her from the room . Beau . Beau Brummell You amused me once , but you do so no longer . No , you 're clever ; yes , you are clever , and you dress to perfection , but Mariana has all your charms and more  --  a heart ! Horatia St. Aubyn , your day in the world is waning ; Mariana 's reign begins . I will go and inform her so . She can not be insensible to my regard , to my love , for , strange to say , I begin to think I do love her . Yes , I believe I do . Quite seriously . And I think I love her madly  --  yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment in deep thought ; then walks slowly off through Centre door down the hall . Mariana enters from door down Right from reception room . She has a note in her hand . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Kathleen has conveyed to me my own letter to Reginald unopened . She says he has left his lodgings , and his landlady does not know when he will return . I am afraid men are not what they are represented to be . Sits down in chair near the door at Right . Lord Manly comes on through hall and Centre door . He is slightly intoxicated . Lord Manly . Lord Manly Ah ! Miss Vincent ! What happiness . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Annoyed . Here 's another ! Lord Manly . Lord Manly Wo n't you drink something ? I mean eat something ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent Not looking at him . Thank you , I care for nothing ! There can be no mistake ; Kathleen vowed she delivered the letters . Lord Manly . Lord Manly You wo n't eat , and you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mariana .

Mariana Vincent And , having found me , you may leave me , sir ! Lord Manly . Lord Manly Leave you ! Never ! Never will I stir from this sacred spot . In his endeavor to stand quite still , he staggers and almost falls over . I mean the sacred spot where you are . Miss Vincent , I adore you ! Fact . All you do , I see through rosy-colored glasses .

Lord Manly . Lord Manly You can not ignore me , my love , my passion , my adorashion  --  I mean adoration  --  Miss Vincent  --  I  --  Beau has come on through Centre door . Unperceived , he comes down , takes Lord Manly by the ear , making him rise and stagger back . Beau . Beau Brummell My dear Miss Vincent , how unfortunately unconventional . Lord Manly .

Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot away . You may apologize to Miss Vincent tomorrow . Lord Manly . Lord Manly You apologize to me now , sir . Beau .

Lord Manly Proach aprincing !  --  I mean Prince approaching . Miss Vincent , it is with deep regret I say adieu ! He stumbles to door at Right and goes off . Beau . Beau Brummell Coming down and offering Mariana a chair . She sits . I heartily congratulate you , my dear Miss Vincent , on having escaped a scene . Nothing but the regard I bear you could have persuaded me to so nearly incur a possible fracas . Lord Manly was born with a silver spoon in his mouth , and he has thought it necessary to keep that spoon full ever since . But now that we have found one another , may I not be permitted to continue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with you seriously . I wish to make a confession . I want to tell you what perhaps you know  --  when I first sought your hand , I did not bring my heart . I admired you , ' t is true , but I did not love you  --  not then  --  not madly ! I was  --  I am so deeply in debt , so hemmed in by my creditors , so hard pressed on every side , it was necessary for me to do something to find the wherewithal to satisfy their just demands , or sink under my misfortunes and give up forever the life of the world which had become my very breath and being . The one means at my disposal to free myself from my difficulties was a marriage . I knew your fortune and I sought you out . The admiration I entertained for you the first few days deepened into esteem , and finally expanded into love  --  mad love ! That is why I have rehearsed this to you . At first it was your fortune which allured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent Mr. Brummell ! Beau . Beau Brummell Yet , were you penniless , I would not wed you . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Rising in astonishment . Mr. Brummell ! Beau . Beau Brummell Because I would not drag you down to share this miserable , uncertain lot of mine . No ! I would seek you once to tell you of my love , and then step aside out of your path , and never cross it again . I would not willingly , purposely encompass your unhappiness . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Slowly . I begin to believe in you . Beau . Beau Brummell I remember no other word that you have spoken . May I have the delight of pressing my very unworthy lips to your very dear hand ? Mariana is about to give Beau her hand ; then suddenly withdraws it . Mariana . Mariana Vincent I think , Mr. Brummell , I would rather you did not . Beau . Beau Brummell Thoughtfully . I believe you are right . Yes , I am quite sure you are ! Thank you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mariana Vincent You are not angry , sir ? Beau .

Mariana Vincent Will you leave me , sir , to consider my decision ? I pray you , Mr. Brummell , give me a few moments here  --  alone . She motions toward recess farthest down stage , and crosses toward it . Beau . Beau Brummell I would refuse you nothing . I will await your pleasure in this other recess , and seek you here in five slow minutes . He motions toward the recess , the farthest up stage , and with a low bow to Mariana goes in and draws the curtain . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Holding the curtain which closes the recess where she is standing . I can not bring myself to say yes to him , although a certain sympathy pleads in his behalf , and joins with pride to prompt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has he not replied to my letters ?

The Prince and Mrs. St. Aubyn enter at Centre door , so mach engrossed in each other that they do not see Mariana . Oh , how provoking ! Mariana hides in recess and draws the curtain . Beau . Beau Brummell Who has also looked out at that moment . How very annoying ! I shall have to play Patience on a window-seat , and wait . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Yes . I must own to you , my sentiments toward Mr. Brummell are greatly altered . Until I met you  --  can you believe it ?  --  I positively thought him a man of some parts . Beau .

Mrs. St. Aubyn He mimics you in dress , in everything , but , then , you know , he never had your figure . The Prince and Mrs. St. Aubyn go toward middle recess and seat themselves . Beau . Beau Brummell Heaven forbid ! Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn He really has no taste . Prince . The Prince of Wales He showed that when he chose Miss Vincent for his marked attention . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn And do you think so , too ?

Beau Brummell I 've half a mind to crawl out of the window , but I might be observed . There 's no resource but to try to go asleep . Prince . The Prince of Wales You are a flatterer and a coquette . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn No ; only a woman  --  and under a spell . Prince . The Prince of Wales Damme , that sounds very fine . I should like  --  Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Well ? Prince . The Prince of Wales I should like to be one of those little words that kiss your lips and die . Beau . Beau Brummell One of my pet speeches  --  number five . Mrs. St. Aubyn .

Now ! To be sure , I once thought there was something like love engendered in me by Mr. Brummell , but now I know it was not real love ; it was only a shadow . Prince . The Prince of Wales Why do you think that ? At this moment Vincent enters from the Centre door . All the curtains of the different windows are drawn so he can see no one . Vincent . Mariana Vincent I can not keep away any longer ; she 's been sensible and accepted him , or they 'd have been gone long before this . Mrs. St. Aubyn moves the curtain a little , with a slight exclamation . There they are in the recess behind the curtain . Oh , he 's clever  --  Mr. Brummell  --  very clever . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn I tremble to acknowledge , even to myself , the dictates of my own heart . Ah , sir , I conceive you know only too well who reigns there now . Vincent .

You have bewitched me , sir . I must resist your fascinations , and not forget the difference in our rank . Fashion would condemn me . Prince . The Prince of Wales Damn Fashion ! Vincent . Mariana Vincent Oh ! Mr. Brummell a-damning Fashion . How he loves her ! How he loves her ! Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Ah ! sir , we women are so frail , so easily beguiled ! Prince .

Beau Brummell Slowly handing his snuff-box to the Prince . My dear Wales , first you lose your equilibrium , and now you lose your temper . Take a little snuff . Prince . The Prince of Wales Damn your snuff ! Knocks snuff-box out of Beau 's hand . Beau . Beau Brummell Puts up his glass and looks quietly at him . Very bad manners , very bad . I shall have to order my carriage . Wales , will you ring the bell ? Everybody is aghast at Beau 's daring . The Prince stands petrified . Beau holds out his hand to Mariana , who has been standing in the recess , half fainting . She comes forward , bows low to the Prince , and backs to the door , followed by her father , who is pitifully dejected . As Beau , with a last look at the Prince through his glass , turns and walks toward the door , the curtain falls THE THIRD ACT The Mall , St. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all London walks . There are benches on each side of the stage under the trees . At the back , ladies and gentlemen can be seen walking . Mortimer comes on from right-hand side , and walks up and down impatiently .

Kathleen Airily . Well , what do you expect ? Are n't I a woman ? Say , what 's the matter with your face ? You have an awful gloomy expression of countenance . Mortimer . Morti mer Laughing . You little minx . Well , how goes it ? Kathleen . Kathleen Crossing to bench and sitting down . Why , bad . I ca n't for the life of me keep one lie from spoiling the other .

It 's all abroad , and I left a swarm of creditors at the house , and , worse still , there are two bailiffs after him . Kathleen gives an exclamation of horror . We must hurry on this marriage , Kathleen , or you and I 'll be ruined . We must take pains to keep Mr. Brummell and his nephew apart , for he 's that partial to him there 's no telling what he might n't do if he was to discover Miss Mariana and Mr. Reginald were lovers . Kathleen . Kathleen And we must see to it that Miss Mariana and Mr. Reginald do n't meet , else he 'd explain how he 'd never received any of her letters .

Reginal Courtenay Will your mistress be in the Park this morning ? Kathleen . Kathleen No , sir ; she left town to-day , sir . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay A little wistfully . Was she  --  in good spirits , Kathleen ? Kathleen . Kathleen Oh , beautiful , sir ! She skipt with joy . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Gives Kathleen money , and then slowly walks away .

Reginal Courtenay But he will see me ? Mortimer . Excuse me , sir , but he especially mentioned your name , sir ; he could not even see you . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Will he not be in the Mall this morning ? Mortimer . Mortimer No , oh no , sir . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Well , tell him I will visit him tomorrow . Reginald goes off down path to the Right . Mortimer . Mortimer That was a tight squeeze . I expect him here any moment . I must see him and warn him of the bailiffs , if he only arrives before they do . Mortimer goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters from the lower left-hand side , and walks slowly to the Centre , followed by Mortimer . Mortimer seems quite out of breath . Beau is dressed in dark green silk knee-breeches , green coat , black silk stockings , buckled shoes , frilled shirt and neckcloth ; wears two fobs , carries cane with eye-glass in the top ; has gray high hat of the period , yellow waistcoat , yellow gloves , large red boutonnire . Mortimer . Mor timer Mr. Brummell , sir ! Beau starts , turns , lifts cane slowly , looks at Mortimer through glass on top , then turns away and continues his walk . Mortimer . MortimerVery deferentially , but firmly . Mr. Brummell , sir ! Beau . Beau Brummell Without turning . I think there is some mistake . Mortimer . Mortimer Excuse me , sir , but I must speak to you .

Beau Brummell Serious ! then it is sure to be unpleasant  --  wait till I take some snuff . Takes snuff very quietly , and with much ceremony replaces box ; then nods to Mortimer and listens . Mortimer . Mortimer Sir , your quarrel with the Prince is already common talk . Beau . Beau Brummell Brushing a little snug off his ruffles . Ah , poor Wales ! Mortimer . Morti mer There was a crowd of creditors at your door when I left , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell That is neither new nor serious . Mortimer . Mortimer But they were angry and would not go away . Beau . Beau Brummell Why did you not send them off ? Mortimer . Mortimer Sir , we 've been sending them off for the past two years , and now  --  they wo n't be sent . Besides , sir , there are two bailiffs who swore they 'd have you if they had to take you in the Mall . Beau . Beau Brummell Impossible ! Mortimer . Mortim er I fear not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beau Brummell Here ? In the Mall ? I would rather perish ! There is no help for it . To himself . I must make a shield of my marriage . I blush to do it , for it would seem to leave a blot upon my love for Mariana , but a blot upon that love is better than a blot upon the name of Brummell , the name she is to wear . Aloud to Mortimer . Mortimer ! Morti mer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell You must hasten back and meet them , these dogs of bailiffs ; you must prevent them by telling them of my marriage to the daughter of Mr. Oliver Vincent . That prospect should satisfy them . Promise them all they demand  --  and added interest . Beau starts to go off at the right-hand side ; Mortimer also moves off to the Left . Promise them everything . Mortimer stops and bows respectfully , then starts again . Beau moves on a few paces , then stops again . Promise them anything ! Mortimer again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mortimer also starts again to go . Beau stops suddenly . Beau . Beau Brummell And , Mortimer ! Mortimer stops , and comes back a few steps . You must not go unrewarded Mortimer looks pleased and expectant ; promise yourself something ! Beau walks slowly of at the right-hand side and Mortimer , with low bow , replaces his hat , and goes quickly of at the Left side . Mortimer . MortimerAs he exits . Yes , sir ! Vincent and Mariana enter from the upper left-hand entrance . Mariana is dressed simply but prettily in a light flowered silk gown and poke bonnet , with a parasol . Vincent . Mariana Vincent We 'll be sure to meet him here somewhere . You must do it all , Mariana . He was just as haughty with me last night after we left Carlton House as he always was . You would n't have thought he had just sacrificed himself for me . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Sacrificed himself for you , papa ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent Is n't it sacrificing himself for him to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has done to resent your father 's insult ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent Trying to lighten the seriousness of the situation . I fancied he did it partly on my account , papa . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Of course , you little rogue , it was for us both , but it 's you alone who can repay him . He has n't a penny , and this rupture with the Prince has brought down all his creditors upon him . With the money your dowry will bring him Mariana turns her head away , biting her lip. , he can pay off his creditors and defy the Prince . Without it he can do neither , and is utterly ruined . Mariana . Mariana Vincent I realize , father , that it is through us this sudden calamity has come upon Mr. Brummell . It was you , papa , who were to blame . Why did you bring down the curtain before the comedy was over ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent A little irritably . Come , come , Mariana , you have too teasing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , my dear father , I only want to help you by making light of the matter .

Well , he shall not suffer for it . Father , I promise you that I will accept his hand ! Vincent . Mariana Vincent And I feel sure that it will mean happiness for you in the end . Wait here seats Mariana on bench at Right a moment , and I will return with Mr. Brummell . Vincent exits at the upper right-hand path . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Yes , yes . I must hesitate no longer . I must think now only of my father , and not remember Reginald , who has neglected me . Gratitude and sympathy shall take the place of love in my heart . Mrs. St. Aubyn enters from right-hand entrance , dressed very exquisitely in white ,  --  large white hat ; she carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , Miss Vincent ! Is Mr. Brummell with you ? Makes a very slight curtsy . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Rising and curtsying . No ; my father . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn And you have him to thank for the scene last evening . It is he Mr. Brummell has to thank for the Prince 's displeasure . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Anxiously . Madam , and is the Prince still angry ? Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn With great relish . He is furious , and swears he will never forgive him . There is , I think , only one person who could influence him in Mr. Brummel 's behalf , and that person  --  is  --  myself ! Crosses triumphantly in front of Mariana , with a sweep of her fan on the last word . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Eagerly going a little toward her . Then , surely , you who have been such a good friend of Mr. Brummell will use your influence in his behalf . Indeed , if I am not wrong , it was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this quarrel , then , will be but a fair return to him . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn You forget I am a woman of fashion . We take all we can get , but we never give anything . No , only on one condition shall I persuade the Prince to hold Mr. Brummell again in favor . Mariana . Mariana Vincent With quiet scorn . Ah , I see , a condition . Then you women of the world condescend to sell , if you will not give . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Angrily . You would do better not to ruffle me . My condition is this : If you will promise to relinquish Mr. Brummell , I will make the Prince promise not to cut him , as he has sworn to do publicly to-day . Looks triumphantly at Mariana , then turns away as though to give her time to consider . Mariana . Mariana Vincent I would I could accept this proposition , but I can not , I can not ! ' T would be the greatest injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hesitate to sacrifice himself for me and my father . I spoke to her of making him a return . Let me not shrink then from making as just a one myself . Then speaking to Mrs. St. Aubyn , who has turned toward Mariana . What right have you to ask any one to give him up ? Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn He sought my favors before you enticed him from me . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Very quietly . I do not believe that . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Angrily . You are uncommonly insolent . Then changing her tone to one of condescension . Well , even if it were not so , I should still have the right to ask you . You seem to forget the difference in our position . She sweeps past Mariana with a grand air toward the Right . At this moment Beau enters from the right-hand side ; he has overheard the last speech . He crosses to the Centre , bowing to Mrs. St. Aubyn as he passes her , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beau Brummell It is you , Mrs. St. Aubyn , who forget . It is greatly to the credit of Miss Vincent if she can overlook a difference your present conduct makes so very marked . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn With a very low curtsy . I will repeat to you what I have just said to Miss Vincent . Beau . Beau Brummell Airily . Pray do not fatigue yourself , madam . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn You will learn that I know how to remain a friend when once I become one . I offered Miss Vincent the chance of regaining for you the Prince 's friendship . Beau . Beau Brummell And your price ? Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn In a low tone . Yourself . Beau . Beau Brummell To Mariana . And you , you refused ? Mariana bows her head . It would have been most unflattering , madam , had Miss Vincent disposed of me so cheaply . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Who is now enraged almost beyond the bounds of endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are speaking ? You are somewhat rash , sir . Discard me , and the Prince shall know all . Beau . Beau Brummell He knows so very little at present , the knowledge of anything would be largely to his advantage . And yet  --  I can not imagine you will tell him  --  all . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Your raillery is ill planned . A woman scorned  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Pray spare us , Mrs. St. Aubyn ; you were never intended for tragedy  --  it does not become you  --  and it produces pause  --  wrinkles . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Has now recovered her composure . Mr. Brummell , I bid you adieu  --  you have taught me how to smile even when  --  tush  --  I am a woman of fashion ! Crosses to Left , passing Mariana . Miss Vincent , I wish you joy . With an exaggerated deep curtsy . Mariana curtsies . Looks of up the Left path , and calls : Manly  --  Lord Manly . Manly comes on , raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your arm . They go off arm in arm . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Sinking down on bench . Your regard and protection leave me too much in your debt . Beau . Beau Brummell Pray let that debt weigh no more heavily on you than do my debts on me . One smile of yours had overpaid me . Mariana . Mariana Vincent If your creditors were as easily satisfied as you are , sir , I should be prodigal of my smiles . Beau . Beau Brummell Crossing to Mariana 's side . Ah , Mariana , if your smiles were the coinage , egad , I think I should turn miser . Mariana . Mariana Vincent You are not practical , sir I must make you so . Beau . Beau Brummell I am your slave , and the chains I wear are no burden . May I indeed hope that you will accept my humble service ? That you will be my wife ? Stands hat in hand . Mariana .

Mariana Vincent I do indeed hope so . Aside . Or make myself forget . Beau . Beau Brummell Putting on his hat with a buoyant gesture . Come , Mariana , Mariana rises honor my arm  --  and we will tell the whole world of our  --  of my happiness . They go off at left-hand path . Vincent enters from the Right . Vincent . Mariana Vincent I ca n't find him anywhere . I 'm afraid he 's hiding , poor fellow , from those bailiffs , and does n't dare show his face lest he be taken . Where 's Mariana ? Has she changed her mind and gone ? No , she gave her promise she 'd accept him , and I can trust to her word . I 'll search for her now , and perhaps , by so doing , I may find him . Vincent goes out by upper path , left-hand side . Two Bailiffs enter from upper right-hand path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other has a patch over one eye , and both have very red noses ; they are dressed in ragged clothes . First Bailiff . First Bailiff Our gentleman 's so fine we must n't bother our eyes with winking , or he 'll slip through our fingers . Second Bailiff . Second Bailiff Not if I know it . This is the most fashionable affair of my life . Look here  --  who 's this ? He points to the left-hand path . They both quickly withdraw behind a tree . Beau enters from the Left . Beau . Beau Brummell I 'll leave her to inform her father . I must find Mortimer ; he should have returned by now . What if he should not have met those bailiffs  --  if they should still be at large . Zounds ! He sits on bench at Right . First Bailiff . First Bailiff In a low tone . That 's him ! Second Bailiff . Second Bailiff Lud  --  ai n't he scrumptious !

First Bailiff No , sir , the bailiff . Beau . Beau Brummell What is the difference ? The Bailiffs look atone another in amazement . First Bailiff . First Bailiff We 've been looking for you , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell I am so sorry you have put yourself to that trouble , and you must not speak to me here . Do you realize what you are doing ? Suppose some one were to observe you . My valet will attend to you . First Bailiff . First Bailiff Oh , we 'll take care of your valet later ; it 's you that we 've got a couple of papers for this morning . I represent your landlord , sir ! Beau lifts his cane with great deliberation , and looks at him through the glass . Beau . Beau Brummell Are you the best he can do ? First Bailiff . First Bailiff You have lived in his house three years ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rent . Beau . Beau Brummell As though to himself . The ungrateful wretch ! The very fact of my having resided in his house should be more than sufficient remuneration . Second Bailiff . Second Bailiff Comes up in front of Beau , while First Bailiff retires a little , shaking his head as though completely puzzled . And I am here for Mr. Abrahams and several other gentlemen . Beau . Beau Brummell You remind me of the person in the theatre whom they call the super , who represents the enemy on the march or the company in the ballroom . We will dispense with your company , sir . First Bailiff . First Bailiff Coming up again . That wo n't do , Mr. Brummell . You must pay , or come along with us . Makes vague gesture of thumb over shoulder . Second Bailiff . Second Bailiff Making same gesture as he withdraws again . Yes , pay , or come along with us . Beau . Beau Brummell You men must be mad ; the Prince will be here presently , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Bailiff Obsequiously . Oh , if His Royal Highness will help you , sir , of course we wo n't press matters . Beau . Beau Brummell See that you do not . And now , looking at them through his glass trot away , trot away , and walk in Fleet Street ; the Mall is really no place for you . He turns , lifts his boutonnire so he can inhale the perfume of the flowers , and then walks away with great deliberation . They stand staring after him for an instant , stupefied . First Bailiff . First Bailiff We 'll keep our eye on our gentleman , just the same . These little rumors about the Prince and him might be true after all , and if they are , why , we wo n't walk in Fleet Street alone . He pulls a black bottle out of his pocket , takes a drink , and then hands it to the Second Bailiff , who also takes a drink ; then they go off in the same direction Beau went .

It 's near time for the Prince to be out , and I would n't miss observing the meeting for worlds . Pray , Sherry , give us your opinion  --  will he cut him or not ? The Duchess has been flying around , looking for Beau in every direction . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Really , Duchess , I can not say what the Prince will do . He 's too great a fool for me to put myself in his place . Manly . Lord Manly Damme , of course he 'll cut him , and , moreover , Beau deserves it . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Decidedly . Then , for my part , I say , let 's move on . Duchess . The Duchess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must see for ourselves , so that we can trust our own ears and know how to treat Mr. Brummell accordingly .

Lady Farthingale . Lady Farthingale Mr. Brummell will never be able to stand it if he 's injured . I should not wonder now if he fainted ! Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Dear me , do you think so ? Face fails as though disappointed . I do n't know , I 'm afraid not . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Impatiently . He 's more likely to resent any insult , I 'm convinced . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Most excited , rushes to Lady Farthingale . What ! A duel ! Oh , Lud , Lady Farthingale , only think  --  a duel ! Deuce take it , where can Beau be ? I 'm afraid the Prince will arrive first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prithee be calm ; you are too great an enthusiast . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Looking off at the Right . Here comes Mr. Brummell , I vow . Do you notice anything different in his manner of walking ? Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Monocle in eye , looks off in direction Beau is supposed to be . He seems to have the same number of legs as formerly . He crosses over to the Left . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Oh , you may rail at me , Sherry , but it 's no laughing matter for Mr. Brummell , I can tell you . Lady Farthingale . Lady Farthingale Rising so she can see better . He 's coming  --  he 's coming ! Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Lud , we must not expose ourselves ! We must at least feign utter ignorance of the affair . Beau enters . Ah , Beau !

Touching his cheek . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Much embarrassed . Complexion . Beau . Beau Brummell Yes , your complexion in the sun . Chats with Sheridan . Duchess , very angry , does not know what to say until Lady Farthingale 's speech gives her a chance to show her spitefulness . Lady Farthingale . Lady Farthingale Here comes His Royal Highness !

Is he really ? Where 's the music ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's be going , Sherry , there 's no music . Takes Sheridan 's arm , and they move off to the Left . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Meaningly . What , Beau , you would n't leave before His Royal Highness comes ? Beau . Beau Brummell Seeing there is no escape , meets his fate gallantly . By my manners , no ! Sherry , let us meet him . They turn and start to the Right , as the Prince enters with Mrs. St. Aubyn on his arm . The Duchess has retreated back to where Lady Farthingale is standing . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington The deuce , did you hear that , Lady Farthingale ? Beau and Sheridan reach the Centre and stop . The Prince and Mrs. St. Aubyn pass directly by Beau , although he stands , hat in hand , and the Prince addresses Sheridan . Beau replaces hat and listens with an amused expression . Prince . The Prince of Wales Sup with me to-night , Sherry , after the play . Mrs. St. Aubyn and the Duchess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll make a night of it . Sheridan can only bow acquiescence , and the Prince and Mrs. St. Aubyn move on a little way . Beau , lifting his glass , looks after them and says to Sheridan : Beau . Beau Brummell Sherry , who 's your fat friend ? Sheridan is divided between delight and amazement at his daring , and consternation at thought of the consequences , and whispers in Beau 's ear . Prince . The Prince of Wales Who has stopped short . Well  --  damn his impudence ! Beau . Beau Brummell Affects not to hear or understand Sheridan . I beg your pardon , who did you say ? I had no idea he looked like that . Is it really ? You do n't say so ? Dear , dear , what a pity ! What a pity ! Takes Sheridan 's arm and they go off at the Right , Beau with his usual imperturbable air , and Sheridan visibly shaking and dejected . The Prince and Mrs. St. Aubyn are at the Left , the Prince speechless with rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Well , I 've had all my pains for nothing .

Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn Duchess , you look ill . Does n't the air agree with you , or is it the daylight ? Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Loftily . I hope , my dear Mrs. St. Aubyn , you 'll never look worse . With a deep curtsy . Mrs. St. Aubyn . Mrs. St. Aubyn With affected horror . Heaven forbid ! The Prince and Mrs. St. Aubyn exit at Left . All the people at back exit . Duchess . The Duchess of Leamington Come , let 's be going . Lord Manly offers one arm to the Duchess , Lady Farthingale takes his other arm . They move off toward the Left . Where can Beau have disappeared to ? Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say it was uncommonly ill-natured of him not to make more of a scene for our sakes , you know . They all go out . Beau and Sheridan enter from the Right , followed by the Two Bailiffs . Sheridan speaks as they come on . Sheridan . Richard Brinsley Sheridan Your marriage , my dear Beau , will redeem your misfortune , and it is the only thing that will . They have reached the Centre by this time , and Beau sees the Bailiffs . He stops , puts up his glass , looks at them , and says : Beau . Beau Brummell Shaking his finger at Sheridan . Sherry , Sherry , who are these fellows following you ? Sheridan turns and sees the Bailiffs , and becomes much agitated . Bailiff . Bailiff Mr. Brummell , sir ! Beau sees it 's no use to try to deceive Sheridan . Beau . Beau Brummell Zounds ! Proceed . Sherry , I will join you in a moment . Well , my good men ! Sheridan hurries off , shaking his head sadly . Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Bailiff . Bailiff Come , come , we 've had enough of your airs , now . You 'd better come along with us quietly . Places finger on Beau 's shoulder . Beau . Beau Brummell Moves away . For Heaven 's sake , do n't put those hands on me ! Why do n't you wear gloves ? Bailiff , who had retreated a step , comes closer . And do n't come so close . You are too hasty and ill-advised  --  you have no manners . Bailiffs retreat in real confusion and astonishment . There 's one resource , I must tell them . He takes out snuff-box , and takes snuff with great deliberation , and does not speak until he has returned box , brushed his lace ruffles ,  --  then he turns to them . Had you met my valet he would have delivered to you my message . It was to the effect that the banns of marriage between the daughter of Mr. Oliver Vincent and myself are to be published in St. James 's on Sunday . As the son-in-law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master 's demands , but handsomely remember you yourselves . Now , trot away , trot away , anywhere out of my sight . Turns away . Bailiff . Bailiff We 've heard one of your fine stories before , and we do n't go till you prove what you say . Beau . Beau Brummell How very annoying ! Looks off at Left and sees Mariana . His face lights up . Here comes Mariana . Here is the young lady herself . Withdraw and you shall have your proof . Bailiffs look at each other . First Bailiff . First Bailiff A little doubtfully . Well ! Second Bailiff . Second Bailiff Still more doubtfully . Well ! ! First Bailiff . First Bailiff Well , we 'll see what it is , eh ? They exit at the back Left . Beau walks down to the Right , brushes his shoulder where the Bailiff 's hand had rested , turns and crosses toward Left as though to meet Mariana , and suddenly stops . Beau . Beau Brummell What ! Looks again as though he thought himself mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head as though to dispel the thoughts that would come . Then walks slowly toward the path at back , leading off to the Left . Mariana enters hastily , followed by Reginald , both much agitated . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay I have been wretched beyond the telling  --  my letters left unanswered , not one word from you in fourteen days ! Mariana . Mariana Vincent My letters and appeals unanswered is what you mean , sir . I wrote you even up to yesterday , and Kathleen vowed that she delivered all the notes till then . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay To whom did she deliver them ? ' T was not to me . Mariana . Mariana Vincent With a cry of joy . What , you did not receive them ? Then Kathleen has played me false . Oh , Reginald , what I have suffered in wrongly thinking you untrue to me . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Such doubt of me was cruel , Mariana , but lightly come , ask my pardon and see how quickly I 'll forgive you . Comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws away . Mariana . Mariana Vincent No  --  no ! I can not , I can not . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Misunderstanding . Then see , I 'll forgive without the asking . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Still refusing to let him take her hand . Reginald , what will you think ? How can I tell you ? It is too late now . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Too late ! What do you mean ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent I have promised myself to another . Beau is seen at back , head bowed , his attitude one of utter sadness . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Forcibly . You must break that promise . To whom has it been given ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent To Mr. Brummell . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Mr. Brummell ! In shocked surprise . Great Heavens ! Mariana , he is my best friend  --  my benefactor . Mariana . Mariana Vincent No  --  no ! Reginald . Reginal Courtenay My mother 's only brother . It is he who , since her death , has cared for me most tenderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from every harm . Mariana . Mariana Vincent He is overwhelmed now by his difficulties . His creditors are like bloodhounds on his track . He has sacrificed himself for me in defence of my father . Through me alone can he be rid of his distresses . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay And he loves you . I know that , too , and you , do you love him ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent Reproachfully . You should not ask me that . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Taking her hands . You are right ! But I can not give you up , nor can I see my uncle ruined ; he is the one man in the universe from whom I would not steal your love . ' T is you who must decide . Mariana . Mariana Vincent And I have done so . I am his . Beau comes down to the Centre . Reginald and Mariana draw back on each side . Beau . Beau Brummell No  --  no , I give you up ; I release you from your promise . The Bailiffs enter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starting forward . Sir ! Beau . Beau Brummell Take her , Reginald ! He holds out his hand to Mariana , who is about to give him hers , when she stops , and withdraws her hand . Mariana . Mariana Vincent No , I am yours . I will not be released . Our love would not be happiness if it entailed your ruin . Reginald has told me that he owes to you his life . My father and myself have greater cause for gratitude to you than I can say . I hold you to your vows . Beau . Beau Brummell Impossible ; I now release you . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Sees the Bailiffs . Great Heavens , the bailiffs ! You shall not sacrifice yourself for us . I join with Mariana against myself , and say that she is yours . Beau . Beau Brummell Looks at him with great affection . No  --  no ! Brushes an imaginary speck from his sleeve . I love you both too well to come between your young hearts ' happiness . Mariana . Mariana Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you loved me ! Beau takes a step toward her with a look of love and reproach . Beau . Beau Brummell Mariana ! No , lifting his hat and turning away I must leave you . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay You shall not ; we will speak to Mr. Vincent and he will help you . Beau . Beau Brummell Reprovingly . I have no claim whatever on Mr. Vincent . Bailiffs standing at back give a nod to each other . Take her , Reginald ; wear her very near your heart for my sake . Hands Mariana to Reginald . And now I would accompany you further , but I can not  --  not now . With a slight , almost imperceptible turn toward the Bailiffs . I happen to have a very pressing engagement  --  with  --  with  --  His Majesty ! Beau turns , after a very ceremonious bow to Mariana to the Right , and moves off . The Bailiffs have come down , and follow him closely ; one of them taps him on the shoulder . Beau stops for an instant , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly off with the greatest dignity . Mariana hides her face on Reginald 's shoulder as the curtain falls THE FOURTH ACT Scene One . A lodging house at Calais  --  a room at the top of the house . The shabbiest furniture , bare floor , window at the back with rude settle in it ; the tops of neighboring houses can be seen from the window . A large fireplace with small fire is at the Right , with a door below , leading into another room . A table stands in the middle of room with a chair each side . Another door at the Left leads into the hall . Beau is discovered sitting in front of fireplace with his back to the audience . He is dressed in a yellow brocaded dressing-gown , apparently the same one worn in Act I , but with its glory gone ,  --  faded and worn , torn in places . He wears old black slippers , with white stockings and brown trousers , " slit so at the bottom and then buttoned tight . " His hair is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of curtain Mortimer enters from hallway . He , too , shows the wear and tear of poverty . All his jauntiness has gone ; he is shabbily dressed . After waiting a minute to see if Beau will notice him , he speaks : Mortimer . Mortimer Not a letter , sir . No answer to those we sent over a month ago . Only one to me from Kathleen , to say if I do n't return immediately she will take to Mr. Sheridan 's gentleman for good , and enclosing me the passage-money over . Beau turns a little and looks at him , as though to see if he is going . I  --  I  --  gave it to the bootmaker , whom I met at the foot of the stairs with a bailiff as I came in . Beau sinks back in his chair again , satisfied that Mortimer will not leave him . Beau . Beau Brummell If you would not use it for yourself , Mortimer , you might at least have bought a pat for dinner instead ; we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bailiff stop and dine with us . Could you make no further loans ? His voice is harsh and strained . Mortimer . Mortim er No more , sir . I tried everywhere . No one will trust us any more . Beau . Beau Brummell Mortimer , what will become of us ? Think what the finest gentleman of his time is undergoing . It 's enough to drive one mad . Mortimer . Mortimer Have you nothing more to sell , sir ? Beau rises and comes to the table . He has a snuff-box in his hand  --  a small black one , in great contrast to the jewelled box he carried in the earlier scenes . Beau . Beau Brummell My last snuff-box . You would not have me dispose of that , Mortimer  --  a paltry trifle that would bring nothing . No , there is nothing , Mortimer . Everything belongs to that wretched female creature who dignifies this hovel with the name of lodgings . Loud knocking is heard at the door , which is thrown violently open , and the Landlady stalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stout , with a red face and a pronounced mustache . She is dressed in a rather short blue skirt , heavy shoes , blue denim apron , black blouse with white neckerchief , a white cap with broad frill . Stands with arms akimbo , looking at Beau disdainfully . Beau . Beau Brummell Talking of angels ! Good morning , my dear madam . So courteous of you to come . It is not my reception day , but you are always welcome . Mortimer , offer this good lady a chair . Landlady . Landlady Speaks with French accent . Chair , humph ! Your Mortimer had better offer me some money , some rent money , or I 'll have you both shown to the door , do you hear ? Rapping on table ; Beau starts as though in distress at each loud rap . That 's what I come to say . Mortimer now offers her a chair . No , I thank you , I 'll stand ! It 's my own chair , and I will not wear it out by sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yourself , Mortimer ; I can not permit you to stand ; you are tired . I 'm so sorry , my dear madam , that I have nothing to offer you ; the supplies for which Mortimer went out a short time ago have not yet arrived . Landlady . LandladySneeringly . Supplies ! Not yet arrived ! Well , when they do they will not pass my door , I 'll tell you that . Hammers on table again . Beau . Beau Brummell Wincing . Do , my dear madam , do help yourself . And speaking of helping yourself reminds me , would you mind returning some of my shirts ? I am sure you can not wear them yourself . Mortimer ! Mortimer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell How many were there in the wash last week ? Mortimer . Mortimer Twelve , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Yes  --  now if you would n't mind returning  --  Mortimer ! Mortimer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell How many shall I require for the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beau . Beau Brummell Yes , if you would not mind returning five , I think I might manage for the remainder of the week . Landlady . Landlady Who has been restraining her wrath with difficulty . I 'll do nothing of the sort , sir , and I 'm sick of your fine manners . I want more of the money , and less of the politeness . With an exaggerated bow , mocking Beau . Beau . Beau Brummell Taking snuff . You mean , my dear madam , you want more of the politeness and less of the money . Landlady . Landlady Furiously . What ! You dare insult me ? Pay me to-day , or out into the street you go ! Your polite talk may do good there . It may do for the stones , but it will not do for the flesh , not for this flesh . Pauper ! Pauper ! Bah ! She shouts the last three words , and as she gets to the door on " Bah , " bangs door and goes out . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone . Beau . Beau Brummell Very slowly . Mortimer . Mortimer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell What did she call me ? Mortimer . Mortimer Half sobbingly . Pauper , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Sinking into chair by right of table . Pauper ! Mortimer . Mortimer I am afraid , sir , she 's in earnest . Beau . Beau Brummell Quite simply . She had that appearance . Mortimer , we must find the money somehow , or I must leave Calais to-night . Mortimer . MortimerHesitatingly . That packet of letters , sir , for which you have had so many offers from publishers . Beau . Beau Brummell What packet , Mortimer ? Mortimer . Mortimer Your private letters of gossip and scandal from people of the Court . I know you have been averse , sir  --  His voice dies away , as Beau , drawing himself up , gives him a withering glance . Beau . Beau Brummell Mortimer , you surprise me . I thought you knew me better . No . I would rather suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once befriended me . Opens drawer in table , and takes out packet of letters tied with a faded ribbon . Fondles them for an instant ,  --  then goes to fireplace , kneels and throws them into the flames . There they go , Mortimer . There they go  --  and almost any one of them might break a heart or blast a reputation . And see how swiftly they vanish ,  --  as swiftly as would the reputations which they are destroyed to save . Mortimer . Mortimer I was wondering , sir , if it would do to appeal to His Majesty . He might overlook what happened when he was Prince . He passes through Calais to-day , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Rising and coming to table . I have thought of it , Mortimer , but I fear it would be in vain  --  well , we might try . Go to him , Mortimer , go to him , and take him pauses to think what Mortimer can take , and feels snuff-box in pocket ; takes it out and handles it lovingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hardly has it left his hands , however , when he reaches out for it again . That is , you might take him the box , but , perhaps , you 'd better not take him the snuff . Mortimer gives Beau the box . Beau picks up a paper lying on the table , saying : Bills , bills . Makes the paper into a cornucopia , and empties the snuff from the box into it ; then taps box on the table , loosening any remaining particles of snuff with his finger ; then looks at table and scrapes any remaining there into the cornucopia ; finally hands box to Mortimer . Give it to him with your own hands ,  --  say Mr. Brummell presents his compliments . And if that fails , like everything else  --  why then  --  Mortimer . Mortimer And what then , sir ? Beau . Beau Brummell Then , taking snuff elegantly from cornucopia then , Mortimer , I can starve . And I promise you I shall do it in the most elegant manner . And you  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's her name ? Mortimer . Mortimer Tearfully . Kathleen , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell Yes . Kathleen . Knock at door . Mortimer opens it and starts back astounded . Mortimer . Morti mer Mr. Vincent , sir . Vincent enters , puffing from the climb upstairs . Beau . Beau Brummell Is astonished and annoyed ; puts the cornucopia of snuff hastily into his pocket , and draws his dressing-gown around him . Mr. Vincent ! My dear sir ! Why , how did you find your way here ? You should have been shown into the reception-room , or my drawing-room , or my library ; you find me in my morning-gown , in my morning-room . I make a thousand apologies . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Do n't , do n't ; I was passing through Calais and I just happened in . Phew , you 're pretty high up here ! Beau . Beau Brummell Yes ; the air is so very much purer . Will you be seated , Mr.  --  It is still Mr. Vincent , is it not ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty ; I could not suffer this man 's pity or compassion . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Sits at left of table . Before I forget it , let me ask you to do me the honor of dining with me to-day . Beau . Beau Brummell With an involuntary drawing-in of the breath . Dine ! At what hour ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent I always dine at five o'clock . Beau . Beau Brummell Thank you ; but I fear you will have to excuse me . I could not possibly dine at such an hour . Turns from table , and goes up toward window . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Aside . Not changed much in spirit , but in everything else  --  Aloud . Well , Mr. Brummell , you must lead a dull life of it here in Calais . Beau . Beau Brummell Still at window , and jauntily . You forget , Mr. Vincent , that by living in Calais I do what all the young bucks do  --  I pass all my time between London and Paris . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Witty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dampen your spirits . Beau . Beau Brummell No ; and I use none other . That is the reason I have nothing to offer you . Had I known of your coming I should have been better prepared to receive you . Comes down and sits at right of table . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Looking around the room . You must be hard pressed for money , if you do n't mind my saying so . Beau . Beau Brummell Very hastily and airily , and rising . Oh , no ! You have quite a mistaken notion of my affairs , because you miss certain useless articles given away as pledges  --  swallows a word ahem  --  of gratitude for favors shown me . I always pay a debt , Mr. Vincent , when it 's a social one . Vincent . Mariana Vincent But those other debts which rumor says are overwhelming you again . Now , if you 'd let me pay them  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Sits at right of table . In a very cold tone . Thank you , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are impertinent . Vincent turns away rebuffed and disappointed . Beau to himself : No , I will not be so humiliated by her father . I would rather tell a little lie instead . To Vincent . I assure you , since the renewal of my friendship with the Prince , now His Majesty !  --  Makes a slight bow at " His Majesty . " Vincent . Mariana Vincent Coming down , delighted . Friendship with His Majesty ! Beau . Beau Brummell What ! Has not rumor told you that , too ? She 's a sorry jade , and sees only the gloomy side of things . Then , I suppose you have not heard that the King has pensioned me ! Takes handkerchief from pocket ; it is full of holes . Vincent . Mariana Vincent But  --  Beau . Beau Brummell I see you still have that very unfortunate habit of " butting . " Why , how , how , without a pension , could I keep up this establishment ? Holding up the tattered handkerchief in his trembling hand , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help me more than he knows . Vincent . Mariana Vincent All the more reason , then , why you should return to London and marry my daughter . Beau . Beau Brummell Are you still obstinate on that point ? Do you still refuse her to Reginald ? Knock is heard at door . Vincent . Mariana Vincent There is Mariana . I told her to join me here . Beau . Beau Brummell Rises in consternation , draws his dressing-gown around him , looks down at it . Mariana  --  Miss Vincent , coming here . Mr. Vincent , one moment , one moment , Mr. Vincent , one moment . Goes hastily to door at Right , bows to Vincent , and exits . Mariana enters from hall door at Left . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Is he here ? Have you succeeded ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent My child , we have heard false reports in town . He has a pension from His Majesty . He is friends with the King . Dear me ! I hope I have n't offended him . Mariana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looks around the dingy room . Are you quite sure he 's not deceiving you ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent Quite sure ; he could not deceive me . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Then , father , there is no further need for me to make the sacrifice you demanded , and which Mr. Brummell 's need did justify . Vincent . Mariana Vincent By no means . I am all the more determined on it . Mariana . Mariana Vincent I also am determined now , and say I will not marry him . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Tut , tut ! Hush , he 's coming  --  he 's somewhat changed . Beau enters . He has put on his coat  --  a shabby , full-skirted brown coat . Has dingy black neckerchief on . Bows very low to Mariana . Beau . Beau Brummell Good morning , my dear Miss Vincent . I trust the stairs have not fatigued you . You should feel at home , so high up among the angels . Mariana . Mariana Vincent Shows she is much affected by Beau 's changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find you happy with the world and with yourself . We had feared otherwise . Beau . Beau Brummell I lead a charmed life ; even now , you see , it brings you to me . Mariana . Mariana Vincent And has it brought your nephew , too , sir ? Beau . Beau Brummell That may be your privilege . Mariana . Mariana Vincent I trust it may be , or else that you will bring him back to me . As she says this , she turns away and goes up toward the window with Vincent , who shows he is not pleased at this speech . At this moment , Reginald enters quickly , throwing hat on table as he goes by , and rushing up to Beau , holds out his hand eagerly . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Uncle ! Beau . Beau Brummell With great affection . Reginald ! Then recollecting himself . No , Reginald , a glance of the eye . Reginald , my boy , you here , too ! Reginald . Reginal Courtenay I heard yesterday of your distresses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see Miss Vincent and her father ? Reginald turns , sees Mariana , and crosses to window to her , where they stand eagerly talking . Vincent goes toward hall door , evidently very anxious to get Mariana away . I might have accepted it from him , but he has come too late . This Vincent shall not know the truth . But Reginald shall have Mariana , and Vincent shall give her to him . Vincent . Mariana Vincent I think , my dear , you had better go and wait downstairs for me . Beau . Beau Brummell No , no , let Miss Vincent remain ; my nephew will entertain her , Reginald and Mariana at this begin talking more confidentially and I wish to consult you privately in my room for a few moments . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Now , my dear Mr. Brummell , I must insist on Mariana 's retiring . Beau . Beau Brummell And I must insist that Miss Vincent remain . I see your manners have not improved . I will not detain you a moment . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon likely to become vacant . Now , who 's eligible ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent An earldom ! Beau . Beau Brummell You know more about matters in town than I , and I wish to be prepared in case my influence should be needed . Now , what name would you suggest ? Vincent . Mariana Vincent Gasping . You honor me , Mr. Brummell . Beau . Beau Brummell Very likely , but I wish you would n't gasp so . Indeed , I do honor you in asking you for your daughter 's hand  --  Reginald and Mariana start and look around . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Bows very low . Mr. Brummell ! Beau . Beau Brummell For my nephew ! Reginald and Mariana turn again toward window , relieved . Vincent . Mariana Vincent My dear Mr. Brummell , you know I am opposed to that , and I hope to persuade you  --  Beau . Beau Brummell Significantly . Who is eligible for the earldom  --  exactly  --  and I think  --  mind , I say I think  --  we both have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade you who is eligible for your daughter . He bows to Vincent and motions him to door at Right . Vincent . Mariana Vincent Speaking as he goes . Gad ! Zounds ! An earldom ! If this should be my opportunity at last . Mariana shall marry the boy if he wants it . Exits . Beau . Beau Brummell Turns to speak to Mariana and Reginald , and finds them so absorbed in each other they do not even see him . He attracts their attention by knocking a chair on the floor . They start guiltily apart . My dears , I am about to draw up the marriage settlement , and , perhaps , I 'll make my will at the same time and leave you everything . They both bow . I will now allow you to settle the preliminaries by yourselves . They immediately retire again to the window , and are once more absorbed in each other . Beau stands watching them for a few minutes , then turns away , puts hand over his eyes and totters off . Mariana . Mariana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand , do you ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Coming down to her side . I do n't desire to . I take the fact as it is . Kisses her . Mariana . Mariana Vincent I think you take much else besides , sir . Are n't you a trifle precipitate ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay No , this is the first preliminary . Puts arm around her waist . I think I shall linger over the preliminaries . Mariana . Mariana Vincent But has my father relented ? Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Surely I Or why did you come here ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent We heard Mr. Brummell was in great distress , and we came to help him , but we found the rumors were false ; his friendship with the King has been renewed . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Thank Heaven ! Then his troubles are at an end . Mariana . Mariana Vincent My father still clung to the idea of our marriage . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay And you ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent That question is superfluous , sir . Have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vincent enter  --  Vincent a little ahead of Beau . Also Mortimer comes on dejectedly from hall door . Beau .

Are you still bent on marrying him ? Mariana . Mariana Vincent You mean , papa , that he is still bent on marrying me , and that I  --  I am not unwilling . Vincent . Mariana Vincent She is yours , sir . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay Coming back to Mariana . Mine ! Mortimer . MortimerGoes up to Beau at right of table , and hands him snuff-box . It was returned without a word , sir . Beau . Beau Brummell In a loud tone . Beg Her Grace to excuse me this afternoon . Mortimer . Mortimer Yes , sir . Reginald . Reginal Courtenay You will dine with us , Uncle Beau , on board the vessel ? Beau . Beau Brummell Thank you , but I fear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I ask you to retire . I happen to have a very pressing engagement . Mariana . Mariana Vincent When will you be in London , sir . You will be there for our wedding ? Beau . Beau Brummell I hope so  --  and you must accept some little present , some little trifle , some little token of my affection and regard  --  some  --  some  --  remembrance . Now what shall it be ? Eh ? What shall we say ? They all look around the room , which is , of course , bare of all ornament . What do you really think you would like best  --  hum ? Absently fingers the snuff-box which Mortimer brought him . Ah , yes , this snuff-box  --  it has just been sent to me by  --  His Majesty . Hands Mariana snuff-box , which she takes with deep curtsy and goes back to Reginald , showing it to him . Vincent . Mariana Vincent At door as he goes out . I shall probably hear from you , Mr. Brummell ? Beau . Beau Brummell Absently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reginald comes to him ; Beau places his hand on Reginald 's shoulder . God bless you  --  Reginald picks up hat from table and crosses to door . Mariana comes down , gives hand to Beau , curtsies ; Beau raises hand to his lips . Mariana draws it away , backs toward door , makes another curtsy , turns to Reginald , and they go off gaily , apparently talking to each other . Beau puts hand over eyes , staggers back , and leans against table for support . the curtain falls THE FOURTH ACT Scene Two . An attic room . Sloping roof . Walls discolored with the damp . Paper peeling off . Window at the back . A bare deal-table over near the Left , with one chair at its side . Another chair stands down near the front , at the right-hand side .

No , Mortimer , I have only just come in , and you forget this is Thursday , when I always entertain . Sinks into a reverie . Mortimer . Mor timer Poor Mr. Brummell ! He 's getting worse and worse .

MortimerGoes up to the window-ledge , and brings down an old broken plate with a few dirty cards . These cards wo n't last much longer .
