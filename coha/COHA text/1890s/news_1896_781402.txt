WATSON , ? . , policeman ; scalp wound and bruised . The fire started in J. Stretheimer &; Co. ' s shirt-waist factory , which was on the fifth floor of the building . In this factory , and in Van Zandt &; Jacobs 's collar and cuff factory , on the three floors immediately below , about 300 persons , mostly girls and women , were at work . There was a saloon and restaurant on the ground floor , and several minor enterprises were carried on in other parts of the building . Rapid Spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairway . which was the only exit outside of the fire escapes in the rear , was cut off almost immediately , and in the panic that followed five women jumped from the windows , three of whom lost their lives . It is believed by everybody , even the proprietors and employes in the shops , that as many as twenty girls and women were overcome before they reached the street , and were burned up in the building , and some persons who were familiar with the interior of the building and know how limited were the means of escape place the total loss at least at thirty . Origin of the Fire . A little boy , about 5:25 o'clock , lighted the gas in what is known as the cutting department of Seckheimer &; Co. ' s factory . This was where the goods of which the shirt waists were made were cut . The boy climbed up to the cutting table and lighted the gas . Then he threw the match , which was still burning , to the floor , and it ignited a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackling of fierce and uncontrollable flames , and the room was filled with smoke . Miss Lilie Kreiger , a girl , realized the imminence of the peril , and at the risk of her own life rushed through the different departments of the building , and , warned the employes of the danger . The bravery of a volunteer fireman saved her from death . When the employes in the fifth story realized that the fire was beyond control and was likely to prove disastrous , a great panic immediately ensued . Jumped from Windows . Some of the girls found their way down the stairway . Others succumbed to the dense smoke and sank to the floor . Others jumped from the dizzy height of the River Street windows to the pavements below . About half of the girls who were employed on the top floor used the fire escape , and found their way to the ground in safety . The crush on the stairway was frightful . Probably 200 persons attempted to make their escape by this exit at the same time . Many were trampled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their feet and thrown to the landings , and some are said to have been left unconscious on the stairway . The majority of the employes finally reached the street , but they were so overcome by excitement that it was impossible to learn from them how many had been left in the building . Heart-Reading Scenes . Heartrending scenes were witnessed on the streets . The mothers and other relatives of the girls who were at work in the factory soon leained , of the disastrous fire and hurried to the scene . They gathered around the burning building , distracted with grief and fear , making anxious inquiries for loved ones . Some of them attempted to rush up into the burning building , and the officers and bystanders found it difficult to restrain them . A number of women were soon on their knees on the ice-covered pavements crying piteously to heaven for assistance . The spread of the flames was remarkable . There was a strung wind blowing at the time , and in an almost incredibly short time the building was afire from top to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , and there was every indication early in the evening that the entire block would be consumed . The fire extendel into the big structure north , and gutted it . The Western Union Building was burned out , and it was not until about four hours after the fire started that it was under control . The loss probably will reach $400,000 . The three girls who were killed by jumping from the windows were almost unrecognizable when picked up , so fearfully were their heads crushed . Many of the injured were those caught under falling walls . While the fire was raging in the Kenmore restaurant , Thomas Rosso , an Italian peanut vender , who was inside , had a narrow escape from death . One of the huge timbers fell on him , and he was imprisoned in the ruins , with fire on every side . Policemen rescued him . The south wall fell in while the policemen were rescuing Rosso , and several of them were badly bruised and cut . Policeman Burke was injured so badly that he was taken to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was struck on the chest by falling timbers , and nearly suffocated . He is quite seriously injured . The Italian was rescued later and taken to the Troy Hollse. and later to the hospital . The firemen who were injured were caught under falling walls . Superintendent of Police Willard made a careful investigation this ' evening and reported shortlyyafter midnight that ' it was almost certain that twelve girls were burned up in the building . He believes that there were many more who did not escape . The full list of the dead can not be completed until to-morrow .
