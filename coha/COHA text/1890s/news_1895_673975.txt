txt Evidently Excise Commissioner Harburger has a deep and accurate knowledge of American history , both ancient and mode/on , and is , therefore , particularly well qualified to tell us all about Sabbath observance here , as it was , as it is , as it will be , and as it should be . In addressing a meeting of Harlemites , he told them that the Sunday which made this country great and grand was not the Puritanical one . " And speaking of that , " he went on , meaning , no doubt , Puritanism , " speaking of that , I am reminded that the old Colonial gentlemen always had their schnapps and beer on Sunday . " Whereupon there was great applause , a , s well there might be . Who ran recall , without a sob of regret for the times that are no more , the touching picture , so firmly fixed In the Commissioner 's mind that even a chance use of the word " Puritanical " brings it vividly before him , the picture of our  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless mixture of schnapps and beer during the short , sweet intervals between morning , afternoon , and evening services ? Truly the law of association is a wonderful one , and psychologists and metaphysicians have good reason to give it much attention in their treatises on the human intellect . A man who carried this reminding business to extremes ? of accuracy , say  --  might be moved , on hearing the phrase " schnapps and beer , " to say that the Colonials who really did drink those liquids were Dutch , and not Puritans at all , and that they made only a temporary success of it , and not a particularly brilliant one , when they attempted to establish a. civic government in this neighborhood . That , however , would be disrespectful , both to Mr. Harburger 's historical knowledge and to the double " o " in our Police President 's name . For those reasons it shall not be even mentioned herd on any pretense whatever . While it is doubtless true that the policeman who arrested , and the Police . Magistrate who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman in the streets of this city were guilty , in a way , of violating that somewhat vague and mysterious , but always intensely venerable , code known as the Law of Nations , yet much difficulty will attend any efforts to magnify the affair into an " international complication . " So far as has been reported , Senor Fombona made no effort to avoid payment of the $3 , exacted from him , either on the ground of his diplomatic rank or on the pretense that the offense charged was not committed . He did , indeed , assert that the whole trouble arose from a mistake on his part as to the identity of the person whom he addressed with such excessive familiarity . Such mistakes are possible enough under certain conditions that not infrequently exist after a dinner that has been too prolonged , and which interfere with one 's ability to distinguish between old acquaintances and entire strangers , but anybody who can settle the resulting unpleasantness at so cheap a rate as that imposed upon the too effusive Venezuelan ought to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official superior with talk about a technical infraction of laws made to lit cases of a wholly different sort .
