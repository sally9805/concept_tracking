txt The Daily Graphic says editorially this morning : 11 " We think it time that Washington ceased wabbling . Weeks ago it was said that the starting of the Spanish torpedo flotilla for the West Indies would compel America to declare war . To-day the flotilla is steaming straight for Puerto Rico . Meanwhile acute Senators in Washington and overclever journalists In New York are planning ingenious campaigns to fix the odium of declaring war on Spain . " Surely this is unworthy of the American people . Two clear lines of policy ace before President : Either to co-operate with . the Sagest:a-Cabinet in , making home rule a reality or to give Spain peremptory notice to quit . To avoid both courses is to turn the terrible Maine disaster into a sort of red herring . If President does not mean war let him say so and the horrors in Cuba will soon be mitigated . The Standard , commenting editorially on the cabled abstracts of Senator Thurston 's speech in the United States Senate yesterday , severely censures it as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish people to . war . " The editorial proceeds : " Such oratory only adds to the insults Spain has borne hitherto with a proud calm which has won European respect , and should have shamed even bellicose Senators . Such folly is unpardonable in a representative of a great nation that is forever declaring its affection for high principles . " If , however , Mr. Thurston was aware of the intentions of the Washington Government , the speech was significant ; for the Government would scarcely employ a speaker so deficient in self-restraint unless it wished the public mind to be fully prepared for war . Fortunately , there is no clear evidence yet that President is of Mr. Thurston 's way of thinking . " The Daily News , in an editorial on the " Conflict Between Congress and President , " says : " It is no wonder , after the horrcrs of the Weyler regime in Cuba , that the President finds it hard to hold Congress in hand .
