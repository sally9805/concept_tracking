txt The rise of such a man , who is acknowledged to be uneducated and ignorant , to political eminence invariably leads the philosophical reader to ask : " How has he done it ? What is his power 7 " Up to the time our flag was fired on at Fort Sumter . Philadelphia was regarded as the best governed of our big cities . The old Quaker instincts and habits dominated , and the imported element was politically infinitesimal in its influence . But with the coming of the war of the rebellion the public spirited and patriotic citizens , who had striven to keep their city polities Duro. neglected the management of their local affairs , and consecrated their abilities to the cause of the Union . The opening thus given to the politician of the slop and garbage class was eagerly seized . In the absence of the lions the hyenas and jackals overran the camp . Methods which the innocent-minded Quaker never dreamed of were introduced in imitation of those of New-York . By means of the vast amouut of patronage swung by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Scott , Combined with the delusive cry of protection ; Pennsylvania was thrown bodily into the Republican Party , and Philadelphia naturally followed the State . The city fell under the control of as cheap a lot of politicians as ever practiced the stuffing of ballot boxes . Combinations were made with the State leaders who controlled legislation at Harrisburg . Charters were tinkered. , statutes amended , new offices created . the patronage of old otlices enlarged  --  all for the purpose of strengthening , developing , and solidifying the Republican Party in every city in the State . Starting with the primaries , which the better class of citizens studiously and contemptuously ignored , the new bosses within a few years had as safe a grip upon Philadelphia as over Tweed had upon New-York . So thoroughly abandoned were these new leaders that with the advent of each succeeding Mayor the police was thoroughly overhauled and every man known to have been hostile to the new regime was smoked out . The police force , therefore , was abjectly servile to the Mayor , and politicians who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , committed acts of lawlessness with impunity . Thus , Martin , for years known as a repeater , the leader and manager of repeaters. not only escaped arrest , but made his headquarters in the Nineteenth Ward Station House . The first political cillloeche ever held was that of folder in the Legislature , awarded in recognition of the services he had rendered his party as a repeater . Then he was promoted to be Sergeant at Arms or the Senate . a lucrative and important position in those days , before the hew Constitution diminished its influence . Ho had worked with the Stokely crowd . and through the influence of Matt Quay he was favored with a sinecure berth in the League Island IS avy Yard , which he disliked and soon abandoned . Mayor Stokely thereupon appointed him Lieutenant of Harbor Police . By this time Martin 's reputation was well established . Increased political power mime with his now office , and he was known as the " Kensington Pet , " partly because of his popularity in his district laid partly from his faculty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was tho acknowledged leader and manager of the crowds of repeaters who wore shipped hero at every important election from Baltimore and Washington , and the houses in which his gangs were organized and drilled are still pointed out by persons who were aware of Martin 's tactics . With increased power it was but natural that Martin 's , gem40. ; of the value .04 his services should rise . He saw bosses without half his power receive offices worth twice the salary of his own . He therefore made a demand for and obtained the office of City Coutmissioner , a pleasant billet , with little or no work and a salary of $5.000 a year , and a term of office of two years . He held the office two terms , but was bent upon climbing higher . When his second term expired he was appointed , at his own request and indorsed by Col. Quay , Mercantile Alinraiser , where the salary was not large , but the drippings were juicy . This office be held until May , 1889 . He was regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes and always " hard up . " With the advent of the Committee of One Hundred in 1881 . Martin adopted the policy of Brer Rabbit , and . so tar as repeating was concerned . " be lay low . " Seven of his boon companions were incarcerated in State prisons for acts to which , according to their own sworn statements , he was accessory . Whenever the Legislature met , Martin was found at Harrisburg . He had no influence in councils in Philadelphia : but he was a keen , alert lobbyist at the capital . lived at the best hotel . spent money lavishly on wine and cigars , and enjoyed that distinction so dear to the lobbyist 's heart ? ? ? You must see Dave Martin , " when interested persons went to Harrisburg in relation to important measures . In 1888 he was one of Quay 's most faithful heelers . For the services then rendered he was promised a good office by Wanamaker . Quay , and Don Cameron . No sooner had Harrison beou inaugurated than Quay submitted the proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work Quay and Martin had performed for the party in the County of Kings and in the State of Indiana as Wanamaker was himself . " Dave Martin is to be appointed Collector of Internal Revenue for this district " was the report that was circulated through Philadelphia one Spring morning in 1889 . The best people of the city , polities aside , were shocked . The Citizens ' Municipal League , the natural ' outgrowth of the Committee of One Hundred , which rid the city of many thugs and thieves during its existence , was unable at the time to act directly in the matter . But an episode occurred at the White House about that time which has become historical . The rugged Republican boss . James MoManes , had heard of the report , and he took the lint train to see the President . Senator Quay was present at the interview . " Mr. President . " began the rugged old politician , who holds the esteem and confidence of all citizens of the Quaker City , " I have come here to protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of David Martin to one of the most important Federal offices in this country . Ho is a disreputable rascal and his appointment as Collector - would be an insult to every respectable citizen of Pennsylvania . " The man who had been an acknowledged power in Republican polities in this pity for almost a generation half arose from his chair as He uttered these words . The indignation which he felt was expressed in every word ho uttered . Senator Quay 's facie never lost that impassiveness which it habitually carries . The President ruffled his eyebrows slightly , but listened intently while Mr. MeManes drew a hasty sketch of Martin 's career . He denounced him as a ballot-box stuffer , as a repeater , as a disburser of corrupt funds contributed by the liquor interest . ' ? Mr. President , " said he . in Conclusion , " you can not afford , no President can afford , to give so important an office to such a man . " " I am informed , " said the President , after a pause , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This reflection on his veracity touched Mr. MoManes to the quick . **I have lived long in Philadelphia , Mr. President , " he said . " I am well known there . You can not find in that whole city a single responsible man who will say I ever uttered an untruth . Senator Quay has known me for a long time , and I ask him if I am not respected in Philadelphia as a man of my word . " " Mr. Mohlanes 's word is above question , " replied the Senator . " Then , " observed Mr. MeManes , " then , Mr. President . I reiterate . all that I have said concerning David Martin , and I reiterate that his appointment will be an insult to the people of my State and a disgrace to your Administration . You can not afford to do it . That is all I have to say , Sir . " The President threw a glance toward the Pennsylvania Senator . For the second time Col Quay appeared to be alive . " The two Senators from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mr. MoManes arose , and , with a quiet bow , left the room . Within forty-eight hours Martin was appointed to the office . The salary was $4,500 a year ; the term of office four years .
