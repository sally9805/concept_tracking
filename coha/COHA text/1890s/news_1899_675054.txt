txt Gen. Otis , commanding at Manila , has cabled the War Department that in his opinion Gen. Miller has the situation well in hand at Iloilo , and that he fully understands the purpose of the President not to crowd the insurgents unduly . It is highly desirable that a hostile collision between the American forces and the insurgents be avoided at all hazards , at least pending the ratification of the peace treaty , and , as Gen. Miller understands this purpose on the part of the President , he will be guided by it and may be relied upon to resort to force only under absolute compulsion . The officials here are now fully satisfied that the trouble at Iloilo may be traced directly back to the Spanish Colonel who was the senior Spanish Army officer in the Philippine group , and directly in command of the Visayas group , including the principal Island of Panay and the city and garrison of Iloilo . Gen. Otis 's reports show that , though besieged with his SW soldiers in Iloilo by a superior force , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had repulsed every attack of the insurgents and had inflicted great loss upon the latter , and altogether there was no reason why they should not have held out indefinitely . This was particularly the case , in view of the knowledge on the part of the Spaniards that by the terms of the treaty the United States Government had undertaken to carry them back to Spain , involving , of course , their release from the siege at the earliest practicable moment . It is significant that Rios delayed the evacuation of Iloilo until he became informed that the Americans were coming , and there is curiosity here to learn how that important information reached Iloilo in advance of the movements of the American transports and in the absence of cable connecti . ns . Undoubtedly it was conveyed by a vessel , and there may be a question raised as to the legitimacy of the transmission of news of the intentions of the American troops in advance in this fashion . One feature of Gen. Otis 's report that has escaped mention so far is his notice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather , presumably at Malalos , about twenty miles from Manila . on the Island of Luzon , on Thursday . A good deal of interest is attached to this meeting , as Gen. Otis reports that by the attendance the strength of Aguinaldo 's party can be gauged . That this is waning rapidly is not doubted , and Gen. Otis feels that when the attempt is made to convene the Parliament it will be found that Aguinaldo has lost his control of the majority and can not command even a working coalition . Such a state of affairs would tend to make easier the task of the military authorities of the United States to establish peacefully a temporary form of government for the Philippines that will command the support of the people and receive the approval of the civilized world . Gen. Otis has not yet published the proclamation by President which was cabled from Washington to him about a week ago . Feeling full confidence in his judgment , the officials here are not disposed to question his withholding the proclamation from the Filipinos , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabling it was to soothe and satisfy the natives and counteract the insidious attacks the Spanish element has been making upon the integrity of the Americans ' intentions respecting the Philippines . Admiral Dewey was heard from by cable at the Navy Department to-day , but made no reference to the present situation in the islands . He reported that he had found a building suitable for a naval hospital at Cavite , and asked authority from the department to establish it at once . It was not gathered that there was an unusual amount of sickness among the American sailors , but realizing that the naval occupation of Manila Bay is to be of a permanent character . Admiral Dewey wishes to establish a shore hospital . Secretary Long called upon Surgeon General Van Reypen , and after a consultation they cabled Admiral Dewey authority to establish the hospital . Medical Inspector Remus C. Persons was selected to take charge of the new hospital , and has been ordered to start at once from New York . The necessary assistants will be selected from among the medical officers of Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
