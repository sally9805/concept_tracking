txt Secretary Gage has locked nimself up in a private room in the Treasury Department , and will deny himself to callers until he has formulated the financial plan which he will submit to Congress . The Secretary several months ago sent a circular letter to seventy bankers and other men of prominence in financial affairs , embodying tentative propositions designed to draw from . them an expression of their views on the proposed currency and banking legislation . The propositions were not put out as representing either his own views or the views of the Administration . and were not so understood by those to whom the letters were sent . The gentlemen addressed made reply , and Secretary Gage has been putting in his spare time during the Summer and Autumn months In a careful perusal of the communications . He admits that his own views as to what is practicable and desirable in the way of legislation have undergone modification during the last few months , as the result of his studies and his observation of the new conditions which have arisen of late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are subjects he does not discuss . He holds that Congress is entitled to the first hearing of his report and recommendations , and that Congress is the proper place to send a statement of his plans of currency and monetary reform . It may be a week or ten days before he will have his financial scheme In shape for submission to the President . and even then the document will be subject to such revision as circumstances may suggest . It is not improbable that Secretary Gage has been brought to a realization that the present Congress is extremely unlikely to favor or adopt any plan looking to the refunding of the National debt with a low interest-bearing gold bond , and those who are close to him incline to the opinion that for expediency 's sake he will not urge the proposition strongly at this time . It is believed , however , that he will pay considerable attention to the desirability of a consolidation of the various kinds of paper money into one issue , but these views are merely speculative , and are not advanced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
