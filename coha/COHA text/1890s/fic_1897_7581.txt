Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : VAGABONDIA. from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) Off with the fetters That chafe and restrain ! Off with the chain ! Here Art and Letters , Music and wine , And Myrtle and Wanda , The winsome witches , Blithely combine . Here are true riches , Here is Golconda , Here are the Indies , Here we are free  --  Free as the wind is , Free as the sea , Free ! Houp-la ! What have we To do with the way Of the Pharisee ? We go or we stay At our own sweet will ; We think as we say , And we say or keep still At our own sweet will , At our own sweet will . Here we are free To be good or bad , Sane or mad , Merry or grim As the mood may be ,  --  Free as the whim Of a spook on a spree ,  --  Free to be oddities , Not mere commodities , Stupid and salable , Wholly available , Ranged upon shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cramped and disabled ; We are not labelled , We are ourselves . Here is the real , Here the ideal ; Laughable hardship Met and forgot , Glory of bardship  --  World 's bloom and world 's blot ; The shock and the jostle , The mock and the push , But hearts like the throstle A-joy in the bush ; Wits that would merrily Laugh away wrong , Throats that would verily Melt Hell in Song . What though the dimes be Elusive as rhymes be , And Bessie , with finger Uplifted , is warning That breakfast next morning ( A subject she ' s scorning ) Is mighty uncertain ! What care we ? Linger A moment to kiss  --  No time ' s amiss To a vagabond 's ardor  --  Then finish the larder And pull down the curtain . Unless ere the kiss come , Black Richard or Bliss come , Or Tom with a flagon , Or Karl with a jag on  --  Then up and after The joy of the night With the hounds of laughter To follow the flight Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of folly and fun . With the comrade heart For a moment 's play , And the comrade heart For a heavier day , And the comrade heart Forever and aye . For the joy of wine Is not for long ; And the joy of song Is a dream of shine ; But the comrade heart Shall outlast art And a woman 's love The fame thereof . But wine for a sign Of the love we bring ! And song for an oath That Love is king ! And both , and both For his worshipping ! Then up and away Till the break of day , With a heart that ' s merry And a Tom-and-Jerry , And a derry-down-derry  --  What ' s that you say , You highly respectable Buyers and sellers ? We should be decenter ? Not as we please inter Custom , frugality , Use and morality In the delectable Depths of wine-cellars ? Midnights of revel , And noondays of song ! Is it so wrong ? Go to the Devil ! I tell you that we , While you are smirking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honest sincerity , We are in verity Free ! Free to rejoice In blisses and beauties ! Free as the voice Of the wind as it passes ! Free as the bird In the weft of the grasses ! Free as the word Of the sun to the sea  --  Free ! Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : EVENING ON THE POTOMAC. from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) The fervid breath of our flushed Southern May Is sweet upon the city 's throat and lips , As a lover 's whose tired arm slips Listlessly over the shoulder of a queen . Far away The river melts in the unseen . Oh , beautiful Girl-City , how she dips Her feet in the stream With a touch that is half a kiss and half a dream ! Her face is very fair , With flowers for smiles and sunlight in her hair . My westland flower-town , how serene she is ! Here on this hill from which I look at her , All is still as if a worshipper Left at some shrine his offering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A luring whisper where the laurels stir Wiles my heart back to woodland-ward again . But lo , Across the sky the sunset couriers run , And I remain To watch the imperial pageant of the Sun Mock me , an impotent Cortez here below , With splendors of its vaster Mexico . O Eldorado of the templed clouds ! O golden city of the western sky ! Not like the Spaniard would I storm thy gates ; Not like the babe stretch chubby hands and cry To have thee for a toy ; but far from crowds , Like my Faun brother in the ferny glen , Peer from the wood 's edge while thy glory waits , And in the darkening thickets plunge again . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : DOWN THE SONGO. from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) I. Floating ! Floating  --  and all the stillness waits And listens at the ivory gates , Full of a dim uncertain presage Of some strange , undelivered message . There is no sound save from the bush The alto of the shy wood-thrush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rhythmic drowsiness keeps time To hazy subtleties of rhyme That seem to slip Through the lulled soul to seek the sleepy shore . The idle clouds go floating by ; Above us sky , beneath us sky ; The sun shines on us as we lie Floating . It is a dream . It is a dream , my love ; see how The ripples quiver at the prow , And all the long reflections shake Unsteadily beneath the lake . The mists about the uplands show Dim violet towers that come and go . Phantasmagoric palaces Rise trembling there , As though one breath of waking weather Would crash their airy walls together With sudden stress , While silent detonations shook the air  --  Vast fabrics toppling to the ground And vanishing without a sound . Ah , love , these are not what we deem ; It is a dream . II . Let us dream on , then ,  --  dream and die Ere the dream pass . Let us for once , like idle flowers , Let slip the unregarded hours , Like the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and past alike forgot , Drinking the dew contentedly In the cool grass . III . Look yonder where the clouds float ; could we glide As they , across the sky 's blue shoreless tide , What better were it than to dream Across yon lake and into this still stream ? IV . Trees and a glimpse of sky ! And the slow river , quiet as a pool ! And thou and I  --  and thou and I  --  Kiss me ! How soft the air is and how cool ! Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : THE WANDER-LOVERS. from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) Down the world with Marna ! That ' s the life for me ! Wandering with the wandering wind , Vagabond and unconfined ! Roving with the roving rain Its unboundaried domain ! Kith and kin of wander-kind , Children of the sea ! Petrels of the sea-drift ! Swallows of the lea ! Arabs of the whole wide girth Of the wind-encircled earth ! In all climes we pitch our tents , Cronies of the elements , With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seaboard knows us From Fundy to the Keys ; Every bend and every creek Of abundant Chesapeake ; Ardise hills and Newport coves And the far-off orange groves , Where Floridian oceans break , Tropic tiger seas . Down the world with Marna , Tarrying there and here ! Just as much at home in Spain As in Tangier or Touraine ! Shakespeare 's Avon knows us well , And the crags of Neufchtel ; And the ancient Nile is fain Of our coming near . Down the world with Marna , Daughter of the air ! Marna of the subtle grace , And the vision in her face ! Moving in the measures trod By the angels before God ! With her sky-blue eyes amaze And her sea-blue hair ! Marna with the trees ' life In her veins a-stir ! Marna of the aspen heart Where the sudden quivers start ! Quick-responsive , subtle , wild ! Artless as an artless child , Spite of all her reach of art ! Oh , to roam with her ! Marna with the wind 's will , Daughter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dream of stain ! At a smile with love aglow , At a frown a statued woe , Standing pinnacled in pain Till a kiss sets free ! Down the world with Marna , Daughter of the fire ! Marna of the deathless hope , Still alert to win new scope Where the wings of life may spread For a flight unhazarded ! Dreaming of the speech to cope With the heart 's desire ! Marna of the far quest After the divine ! Striving ever for some goal Past the blunder-god 's control ! Dreaming of potential years When no day shall dawn in fears ! That ' s the Marna of my soul , Wander-bride of mine ! Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : DISCOVERY . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) When the bugler morn shall wind his horn , And we wake to the wild to be , Shall we open our eyes on the selfsame skies And stare at the selfsame sea ? O new , new day ! though you bring no stay To the strain of the sameness grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and through , And strange as a lawless dream . Will the driftwood float by the lonely boat And our prisoner hearts unbar , As it tells of the strand of an unseen land That lies not far , not far ? O new , new hope ! O sweep and scope Of the glad , unlying sea ! You are new , new , new  --  with the promise true Of the dreamland isles to be . Will the land-birds fly across the sky , Though the land is not to see ? Have they dipped and passed in the sea-line vast ? Have we left the land a-lee ? O new despair : though the hopeless air Grow foul with the calm and grieves , You are new , new , new  --  and we cleave to you As a soul to its freedom cleaves . Does the falling night hide fiends to fight And phantoms to affray ? What demons lurk in the grisly mirk , As the night-watch waits for day ? O strange new gloom ! we await the doom , And what doom none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new  --  and we 'll sail it through , While the mocking sea-gulls scream . A light , a light , in the dead of night , That lifts and sinks in the waves ! What folk are they who have kindled its ray ,  --  Men or the ghouls of graves ? O new , new fear ! near , near and near , And you bear us weal or woe ! But you ' re new , new , new  --  so a cheer for you ! And onward  --  friend or foe ! Shall the lookout call from the foretop tall , " Land , land ! " with a maddened scream , And the crew in glee from the taffrail see Where the island palm-trees dream ? New heart , new eyes ! For the morning skies Are a-chant with their green and gold ! New , new , new , new  --  new through and through ! New , new till the dawn is old ! Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : A SONG BY THE SHORE . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first art ; So it was with thee and me , For I first beheld thy heart On the night I last saw thee . Pine-woods and mysteries ! Sea-sands and sorrows ! Hearts fluttered by a breeze That bodes dark morrows , morrows ,  --  Bodes dark morrows ! Moonlight in sweet overflow Poured upon the earth and sea ! Lovelight with intenser glow In the deeps of thee and me ! Clasped hands and silences ! Hearts faint and throbbing ! The weak wind sighing in the trees ! The strong surf sobbing , sobbing ,  --  The strong surf sobbing ! Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : A HILL SONG . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) Hills where once my love and I Let the hours go laughing by ! All your woods and dales are sad ,  --  You have lost your Oread . Falling leaves ! Silent woodlands ! Half your loveliness is fled . Golden-rod , wither now ! Winter winds , come hither now ! All the summer joy is dead . There ' s a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s an under-voice that grieves In the rustling of the leaves . Pine-clad peaks ! Rushing waters ! Glens where we were once so glad ! There ' s a light passed from you , There ' s a joy outcast from you ,  --  You have lost your Oread . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : AT SEA . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) As a brave man faces the foe , Alone against hundreds , and sees Death grin in his teeth , But , shutting his lips , fights on to the end Without speech , without hope , without flinching ,  --  So , silently , grimly , the steamer Lurches ahead through the night . A beacon-light far off , Twinkling across the waves like a star ! But no star in the dark overhead ! The splash of waters at the prow , and the evil light Of the death-fires flitting like will-o ' - the- wisps beneath ! And beyond Silence and night ! I sit by the taffrail , Alone in the dark and the blown cold mist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night and the sea , and made one with their footfall-less onrush , Letting myself be borne like a spar adrift Helplessly into the night . Without fear , without wish , Insensate save of a dull , crushed ache in my heart , Careless whither the steamer is going , Conscious only as in a dream of the wet and the dark And of a form that looms and fades indistinctly Everywhere out of the night . O love , how came I here ? Shall I wake at thy side and smile at my dream ? The dream that grips me so hard that I can not wake nor stir ! O love ! O my own love , found but to be lost ! My soul sends over the waters a wild inarticulate cry , Like a gull 's scream heard in the night . The mist creeps closer . The beacon Vanishes astern . The sea 's monotonous noises Lapse through the drizzle with a listless , subsiding cadence . And thou , O love , and the sea throb on in my brain together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the night . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : ISABEL . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) In her body 's perfect sweet Suppleness and languor meet ,  --  Arms that move like lapsing billows , Breasts that Love would make his pillows , Eyes where vision melts in bliss , Lips that ripen to a kiss . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : CONTEMPORARIES . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) " A barbered woman 's man , "  --  yes , so He seemed to me a twelvemonth since ; And so he may be  --  let it go  --  Admit his flaws  --  we need not wince To find our noblest not all great . What of it ? He is still the prince , And we the pages of his state . The world applauds his words ; his fame Is noised wherever knowledge be ; Even the trader hears his name , As one far inland hears the sea ; The lady quotes him to the beau Across a cup of Russian tea ; They know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the nascent years Men 's eyes shall see him as one crowned ; His voice shall gather in their ears With each new age prophetic sound ; And you and I and all the rest , Whose brows to-day are laurel-bound , Shall be but plumes upon his crest . A year ago this man was poor ,  --  This Alfred whom the nations praise ; He stood a beggar at my door For one mere word to help him raise From fainting limbs and shoulders bent The burden of the weary days ; And I withheld it  --  and he went . I knew him then , as I know now , Our largest heart , our loftiest mind ; Yet for the curls upon his brow And for his lisp , I could not find The helping word , the cheering touch . Ah , to be just , as well as kind ,  --  It costs so little and so much ! It seemed unmanly in my sight That he , whose spirit was so strong To lead the blind world to the light , Should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . It angered me  --  I did him wrong  --  I grudged my groat and shut my heart . I might have been the prophet 's friend , Helped him who is to help the world ! Now , when the striving is at end , The reek-stained battle-banners furled , And the age hears its muster-call , Then I , because his hair was curled , I shall have lost my chance  --  that ' s all . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : A TOAST . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) Here 's a health to thee , Roberts , And here ' s a health to me ; And here ' s to all the pretty girls From Denver to the sea ! Here ' s to mine and here ' s to thine ! Now ' s the time to clink it ! Here ' s a flagon of old wine , And here are we to drink it . Wine that maketh glad the heart Of the bully boy ! Here ' s the toast that we love most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the flower of love , And joy that is the fruit ! Here ' s the love of woman , lad , And here ' s our love to boot ! You and I are far too wise Not to fill our glasses . Here ' s to me and here ' s to thee , And here ' s to all the lasses ! Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : THE KAVANAGH . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) A stone jug and a pewter mug , And a table set for three ! A jug and a mug at every place , And a biscuit or two with Brie ! Three stone jugs of Cruiskeen Lawn , And a cheese like crusted foam ! The Kavanagh receives to-night ! McMurrough is at home ! We three and the barley-bree ! And a health to the one away , Who drifts down careless Italy , God 's wanderer and estray ! For friends are more than Arno 's store Of garnered charm , and he Were blither with us here the night Than Titian bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And let the warm night in ! Who knows what revelry in Mars May rhyme with rouse akin ? Fill up and drain the loving cup And leave no drop to waste ! The moon looks in to see what ' s up  --  Begad , she ' d like a taste ! What odds if Leinter 's kingly roll Be now an idle thing ? The world is his who takes his toll , A vagrant or a king . What though the crown be melted down , And the heir a gypsy roam ? The Kavanagh receives to-night ! McMurrough is at home ! We three and the barley-bree ! And the moonlight on the floor ! Who were a man to do with less ? What emperor has more ? Three stone jugs of Cruiskeen Lawn , And three stout hearts to drain A slanter to the truth in the heart of youth And the joy of the love of men . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : THE BUCCANEERS. from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) Oh , not for us the easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow hearth , The cabined joys of home ! Keep your tame , regulated glee , O pale protected State ! Our dwelling-place is on the sea , Our joy the joy of Fate ! No long caresses give us ease , No lazy languors warm ; We seize our mates as the sea-gulls seize , And leave them to the storm . But in the bridal halls of gloom The couch is stern and strait ; For us the marriage rite of Doom , The nuptial joy of Fate . Wine for the weaklings of the town , Their lucky toasts to drain ! Our skoal for them whose star goes down , Our drink the drink of men ! No Bacchic ivy for our brows ! Like vikings , we await The grim , ungarlanded carouse We keep to-night with Fate . Ho , gamesters of the pampered court ! What stakes are those at strife ? Your thousands are but paltry sport To them that play for life . You risk doubloons , and hold your breath , Win groats , and wax elate ; But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Fate . The kings of earth are crowned with care , Their poets wail and sigh ; Our music is to do and dare , Our empire is to die . Against the storm we fling our glee And shout , till Time abate The exultation of the sea , The fearful joy of Fate . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : THE OUTLAW . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) Oh , let my lord laugh in his halls When he the tale shall tell ! But woe to Jarlwell and its walls When I shall laugh as well ! And he that laughs the last , lads , Laughs well , laughs well ! He ' s lord of many a burg and farm And mickle thralls and gold , And I am but my own right arm , My dwelling-place the wold . But when we twain meet face to face , He will not laugh so bold . The shame he chuckles as he shows This time he need not tell ; I 'll give his body to the crows , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , lads , Laughs well , laughs well ! Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : THE KING 'S SON . from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) " Daughter , daughter , marry no man , Though a king 's son come to woo , If he be not more than blessing or ban To the secret soul of you . " " ' T is the King 's son , indeed , I ween , And he left me even but now , And he shall make me a dazzling queen , With a gold crown on my brow . " " And are you one that a golden crown , Or the lust of a name can lure ? You had better wed with a country clown , And keep your young heart pure . " " Mother , the King has sworn , and said That his son shall wed but me ; And I must gang to the prince 's bed , Or a traitor I shall be . " " Oh , what care you for an old man 's wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rather you fled on an outlaw 's path , A rebel , a hunted thing . " " Mother , it is my father 's will , For the King has promised him fair A goodly earldom of hollow and hill , And a coronet to wear . " " Then woe is worth a father 's name , For it names your dourest foe ! I had rather you came the child of shame Than to have you fathered so . " " Mother , I shall have gold enow , Though love be never mine , To buy all else that the world can show Of good and fair and fine . " " Oh , what care you for a prince 's gold , Or the key of a kingdom 's till ? I had rather see you a harlot bold That sins of her own free will . " For I have been wife for the stomach 's sake , And I know whereof I say ; A harlot is sold for a passing slake , But a wife is sold for aye . " Body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sale shall be That you shall be harlot and slave as well Until Death set you free . " Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : LAURANA 'S SONG . FOR " A LADY OF VENICE . " from Poems , in Songs from Vagabondia ( 1897 ) Who 'll have the crumpled pieces of a heart ? Let him take mine ! Who 'll give his whole of passion for a part , And call ' t divine ? Who 'll have the soiled remainder of desire ? Who 'll warm his fingers at a burnt-out fire ? Who 'll drink the lees of love , and cast i ' the mire The nobler wine ? Let him come here , and kiss me on the mouth , And have his will ! Love dead and dry as summer in the South When winds are still And all the leafage shrivels in the heat ! Let him come here and linger at my feet Till he grow weary with the over-sweet , And die , or kill . Hovey , Richard , 1864-1900 : LAUNA DEE . from Poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , so weary With it all ! Sunny days or dreary  --  How they pall ! Why should we be heroes , Launa Dee , Striving to no winning ? Let the world be Zero 's ! As in the beginning Let it be ! What good comes of toiling , When all ' s done ? Frail green sprays for spoiling Of the sun ; Laurel leaf or myrtle , Love or fame  --  Ah , what odds what spray , sweet ? Time , that makes life fertile , Makes its blooms decay , sweet , As they came . Lie here with me dreaming , Cheek to cheek , Lithe limbs twined and gleaming , Brown and sleek ; Like two serpents coiling In their lair . Where ' s the good of wreathing Sprays for Time 's despoiling ? Let me feel your breathing In my hair . You and I together  --  Was it so ? In the August weather Long ago ! Did we kiss and fellow , Side by side , Till the sunbeams quickened From our stalks great yellow Sunflowers , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the glade Where our prey lay sleeping , Unafraid , In some Eastern jungle ? Better so . I am sure the snarling Beasts could never bungle Life as men do , darling , Who half know . Ah , if all of life , love , Were the living ! Just to cease from strife , love , And from grieving ; Let the swift world pass us , You and me , Stilled from all aspiring ,  --  Sinai nor Parnassus Longer worth desiring , Launa Dee ! Just to live like lilies In the lake ! Where no thought nor will is , To mistake ! Just to lose the human Eyes that weep ! Just to cease from seeming Longer man and woman ! Just to reach the dreaming And the sleep !
