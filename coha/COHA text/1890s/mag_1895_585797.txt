txt trailing arbutus beneath the decaying leaves and forest debris in early spring comes to my mind when I think of the slum workers of the Salvation Army ; for just so are their lives in relation to the forest of humanity in which they live - out of sight , willingly buried away beneath the darkness , misery , and ill-repute of the slums in which they make their home , yet sending forth the fragrance of their pure , holy lives . To those who only know of the Salvation Army from repute , and who have never looked into the detail of its many branches , it may seem strange that one special division of the work should be called the " Slum Brigade , " when they have the impression that all its work is carried on for the searching out and reaching of the outcast , depraved , and unchurched . By those unacquainted with the poor it is not understood that there are as many different classes and grades among them as among the rich . Those who live with and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings and prejudices , and ideas of caste , that make them live in so many little circles in the great underworld of poverty and misfortune . There are , for instance , the respectable honest poor , who work when they can , and through hard toil and thrift manage to keep their self-respect and to a surprising extent fight the wolf from the door except in the hardest seasons , when many of them would rather starve than beg . Then we find a class made up of the more unfortunate who are constantly feeling the pinch of dire distress , who work occasionally , and whose homes become one or two rooms in a tenement of the poorest character , from which they constantly have to go for shelter into the many low lodging-houses . By day they wander the streets , during their non-working hours . Again there is the lower class that knows no home , the . members of which herd together in the greatest squalor , and live the handto-mouth existence of a hopeless drifting life , where work is not sought , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another class is made up of criminals , who exist entirely through their crimes , and make a very much less precarious living than the aforementioned classes- " living on their wits " they would call it . Yet again there are vast multitudes who , alas , have drifted down from more fortunate // circles through their abandonment to vice and drunkenness , and who continue going down further and further through all the different grades , until they come to the very lowest and most hopeless pauperism . When the Salvation Army launched out upon its work of raising and helping the outcast , it , in a very marvellous manner , reached , and is now reaching , the poor , otherwise untouched by religous influence . Street loungers , drunkards , wife-beaters , wild , reckless youths , and fallen women , were attracted to its halls , by the hundreds of thousands , by the open - air procession , and through the lively and enthusiastic character of its services . As years rolled on the problem of the lowest outcasts of Slumdom , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twos ) , faced the leaders of this movement . Undoubtedly there were thousands living as heathen , aye , almost as savages , right in the midst of our prosperous cities ; people who would not come to our halls , who had never even heard the sound of our drum , and many of whom lived crowded like rats in their wretched haunts , shunning the daylight , to come out only under the cover of night , which was made horrible by their debauchery and crime . Some of these had not even fit rags in which to come out among their more fortunate fellow-men , and others lay too sick in their garret to come out into the daylight . It was in the city of London that this special need was first faced , and means devised to meet it . Investigations had been made revealing an appalling state of affairs . The houses of the poor were found to be in the most unsanitary state of neglect , and so dilapidated in many instances that floors and stairways were giving way , and dangerous rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooms above . For these miserable broken - down homes the people were paying rentals which left them with but a few pennies for their subsistence and the support of their families . The wretchedly poor * wages upon which human beings were trying to exist , and the many cases of death from starvation as a con sequence , came to light in a way which shocked London and raised a great hue and cry about the outcasts and their bitter lot . It was just theii that the army 's first Slum Brigade was inaugurated , and it was a new and very original departure , though on the same old lines of adaptation of measures which had been one of the principles of the movement from its inception . This was before the day of College Settlements , Toynbee Halls , or other work of that kind , so that the army was pioneering in a field new and untried . The Slum Brigade was composed of women who volunteered from the army 's ranks of already trained workers , to go down among the denizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Foreign Mission field to become natives to the native . They were to live in the heart of the worst neighborhood , and to live as their neighbors , becoming poor as the poor around them , and severing themselves from the world of the past as completely as if the shades of Africa 's forests had closed around them . It was in no sense an experimental work to be done for a season , just as " an experience " to prove helpful in other fields of labor , but was to be a practical consecration of themselves to a life worle , with a willingness to do or suffer anything that might come of hardship , sickness , and heartache , out of a genuine love for the outcasts whom they sought to help and save . They do not go to the people in a spirit either of pity or patronage , but just with the neighborly interest and affection that can only be acceptable when given by those who breathe the same atmosphere and live in the same surroundings . The blue uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses and shawls substituted for them , with the addition of coarse gingham aprons . Their home , which was two rooms in one of the poorest districts , was not to be furnished in the style of those they had left , but was to be made like the homes of their poor neighbors , without carpet , or anything that could speak of comfort or ease ; just the necessary table and chairs , stove and bed , and with food as simple and inexpensive as possible . We thoroughly // believed that becoming one with them would be the most effectual way of winning their hearts and confidences , and that it would be more easy thus to find out the best methods of helping them , and also who were the most deserving of help . Then , regarding their duties , they were not to consider themselves mere spiritual advisers of the people , nor to confine themselves only to the nursing of the sick , or the giving of spiritual conifort to the dying . They were to hold themselves ready to do anything and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into close personal touch with the people , and these included the scrubbing of floors , washing of dirty children , nursing of the sick , sitting up with the dying , laying out of the dead , the stepping in as peace-makers in drunken brawls , and many other kindly acts more hazardous , difficult , and trying than I can explain here . It is , however , needless to say that as this army is a movement whose chief interest is in spiritual matters , all these many kindly deeds performed for the temporal welfare of the people were to pave the way for the straightest and most earnest kind of dealing on matters concerning the souL If the tree be good the fruit will be good . If the heart be sound , that which emanates from it will be sound also . Hence the theory of the Salvation Army has always aimed at the root of the matter . You would better society ! Then set to work and better its individuals ; better them in the only really effectual way , by bringing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalt them . iReforms which aim only at educating , giving employment , or improving the environment will not prove a permanent cure for the terrible social degradation and misery of the people ; for where vice , crime , disregard to cleanliness , and utter immorality exist , they will make chaos of your order , filthy ruin of your improved dwellings , and merely use your higher education in the perpetrating of cleverer crime and more extended mischief . Returning to the temporal side of the question , the pauperizing of the people by gifts was to be very carefully avoided , and relief in food or clothing could only be given in cases of absolute starvation or nakedness . The work began in a very small and humble way in a part of East London called Hackney Wick , but it very soon spread to Whitechapel , Seven Dials , and the Borough , and then out into the provincial towns of England . From a very small experiment developed a very large and successful work , which proved without doubt the effectiveness of the new measures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do like work upon their own lines by this brave example , though none of the schemes yet on foot have succeeded in reaching the people of the under-world as the army has reached them , nor do they profess to have got to the rock-bottom depth of degradation which the Slum officers have succeeded so wonderfully in reaching . At the very outset of this special branch of work I was appointed to assist in its oversight , hence its advance and development have always been of very special interest to me . One of Our first cases during the earliest weeks of work in Hackney Wick I think I shall never forget . One of our officers reported to me that in a certain dilapidated house in a back court she had come upon a very pitiful case of poverty . I went with her to see the family . The stairs of the dwelling were so filthy and rickety that we had to walk cautiously , feeling our way with our hands along the wall for support which the bannister no longer furnished . lJp two flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on throwing it open entered the home of a whole family . The room was very small . Exactly opposite the door was a heap of rubbish and refuse upon which lay a baby . It was absolutely without clothing , and was so dirty , that it looked gray from head to foot . It had the abnormal development of head and face so often seen in the starving children of the slums . Resting on its little hands it raised its head and looked at us , and it seemed to me to be more like a little monkey than the child of human parents . Glancing // from the baby to the other occupants of the room I saw a child of some two years standing by the empty hearth , for there was no trace of fire , though it was winter time . Near the child stood a young man with a despairing and consumptive look upon his face . In one corner of the room lay a few rags upon the floor , which was the bed of the family , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful picture of all  --  the mother , so dirty , degraded , and hopeless looking that it made one 's heart ache to think that she was the sister of the many fortunate women who had never stretched a hand to help her . Her garments were so torn that they did not serve as a decent covering , her hair was tangled and matted , and the bloated condition of her face made her look absolutely revolting . By her was an old box serving as a table , and upon it stood a lamp with a cracked and blackened chimney . She did not look up as we entered but continued her work of match-box making . Rapidly and silently she worked , passing box after box from her nimble fingers , and it seemed as if it would be impossible for us to open conversation . Guessing there was a key to her heart as sure as to that of more fortunate mothers , I picked the little baby from the floor , and sitting down amidst the rubbish , held it in my arms while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no time to wash the children , nor to wash herself for that matter , and seemed quite indifferent to any kindly words we might say to her . So kneeling down close beside her we poured out our souls in prayer in the simplest phraseology we could use to a personal friend and Saviour . When we turned to look at her we found to our joy that though she had not stopped her work , her heart had been reached , the tears were coursing down her face , and her poor husband was also weeping . Scrubbing-brushes , soap , and pails were next in order , and our sluth officers visited this family to do the scrubbing and washing which the mother had not time to do . No time ! I do not wonder she had no time-when you realize that she had to make twelve dozen match-boxes to re alize the sum of five cents , and out of that five cents she had to find her own paste and string , and after they were made had to carry them several weary miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work for weeks , and she had to support the family . The little child of two years had the day previous to our visit been dreadfully burned . There had been a fire in the grate that day and his dirty little pinafore had caught . When we saw him he had a frightful open wound from his chest downward . This wound was dressed day after day and the children washed by the loving hands of those whom they learned to look upon as their dearest friends and nearest neighbors . The case was followed up for years and became a most encouraging and satisfactory one . Thus was the work conceived , commenced , and carried forward in the Old World . But that which is of far more moment to us as American citizens is its operation in the most needy slums of our great cities . It is now five years since we began the Slum Brigade work in New York City . I had often , while engaged in other branches of army warfare , looked forward with great expectation to the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of Slumdom , but when I broached the subject to those who had lived in the city far longer than I had , they invariably met me with the assertion that there was no such need here as in the Old World , and that the slums of America were far better in every way than those of which I spoke . Not a few among our friends and critics told me that there was really little need of such work in America , while others assured me that the measures we thought of adopting would surely prove a failure . At that time the book on " How the Other Half Lives* ' was not written , and there was nothing like the interest manifested in public print regarding the great - problems of the slums . Being determined to investigate the matter for ourselves , we selected two of our devoted and faithful workers , and sent them out to become naturalized // to the slums-if I may use the expression . Taking a couple of rooms in a house of most unsavory repute and disreputable surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work quite unannounced as Salvationists , wearing the most ragged clothes , and keeping their mission a secret . The rooms they hired were so filthy that it took one whole week to scrub and disinfect them . They had been formerly occupied by women of disrepute . The neighbors ( there were many families in the same house ) were of the most drunken , demoralized character , and the notorious Water Street houses were right in the rear of them . They had a Chinese laundry on one side of them , and a house of ill fame on the other . Their furniture consisted of one bedstead , plain deal table , an extra mattress for the floor , two chairs and a packing-case to serve as a third , and an old stove which , only having three legs , was accommodated with some bricks to serve as a fourth . A few necessaries in the way of crockery-ware , soap , scrubbing - brushes , pails , etc. , completed their worldly possessions , so that there was nothing to make watching neighbors think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than " the likes of us . " To those who know nothing of practical slum work the account of slumming described by some of the popular writers of the day carries very misleading ideas with it . I have heard of the work of one novelist in which he describes the heroine , who takes her refinement and sweet lady-like surroundings into the slums with her , as decorating her walls with peacocks ' feathers and making fragrant her room with flowers , thus offering a little oasis in the desert to her rough and illiterate neighbors . This may sound very picturesque and charming from the pen of the novelist , but were anything of that sort perpetrated in the slums of New York it would call forth the greatest ridicule and resentment from the neighbors , who could not derive a particle of benefit from such an object - lesson . In two other books which I have in mind the novelist describes the heroine as winding up amid a blaze of diamonds and orange blossoms , after her months ' or years ' experimental slumming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in admiration ! No child 's play is the life of the woman who wishes to consecrate herself to the reclaiming of the lost , and those influences that make a wall or barrier between her and the fallen and unfortunate , must be abandoned forever . At the very onset of the work when the slum-workers had just settled into their new home I went down to spend a short time with them , that I might help in the work of exploring , and might see for myself the need of the New York slums . My dress was an old much-worn calico wrapper out at both elbows , and hanging in tatters around the skirt . An apron with a very large burn in the centre , shoes which , while they were not fellows , boasted of more ventilation than was customary , and were laced with white string , while the whole costume was crowned with an ancient hat the side and crown of which had been partly demolished . *y companions were attired in the same fashion , and I think I can truthfully say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the fact that we were clean , but fortunately this was accounted for in a very happy way by some little children as they shouted after us " Them 's from the country , " and added sotto voce remarks about the " green- " ness of our appearance . It may be naturally asked why rags and tatters were necessary in our work , hence it should be understood that they were merely temporary necessities , for when thoroughly acquainted with the needs and duties of the new battle-field , our slum officers were to work in their own name as Salvationists , and were to replace by neat though poor garments the rags with which they commenced . On the occasion of which I speak , however , we were doing detective work , and to do it successfully such disguise was necessary . We did not learn the needs of slumdom under the guidance of a police detective . We knew our mice too well to visit them with a bell-decorated cat ! Every inch of the ground had to be patiently and wisely approached , gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any appearance of strangeness . It will be quite impossible to picture here the sights and scenes I have with my own eyes witnessed , not only on this but on subsequent visits , and as I have been there but a few times , and for but a few brief hours or days , I personally have seen nothing compared with the large experience of our brave and ever-growing band of slum workers . I could not have believed from looking at the outside of the buildings , the terrible conditions to be found upon the inside . I can say , without fear of exaggeration , that I have found a state of dirt , poverty , and misery quite equal to anything I have seen or heard of in the city of London . I remember one garret , for instance , in the same street as our slum quarters , hardly more than a stone 's throw from them . The floor was not only ingrained with dirt and grime but was rat-eaten and rotten . The windows were broken . and the holes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafters were festooned with cobwebs , and the cobwebs in their turn so laden with soot that we could in&gt; imagine them funeral draperies . Though it was bitterly cold winter weather , and a woman with a cancer eating out her life sat rocking in bed with only one flimsy garment to cover her , yet there was no fire in the broken old stove . The bed itself had broken down and she lay amid the ruins . The only chair in the room had no bottom to it and no back . In a little inner room , with no light or ventilation , the lodger was sleeping , while the drunken husband stood crying and muttering at the foot of the dilapidated bed . No food , no fire , no comfort-filth , vermin , cold , and despair were all we found that day at the top of a great house which had once been some gentleman 's mansion . Then there are the cellars in which you would hardly think that human beings could live , and yet there we have found them living on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the constant annoyance of troops of rats running around . Even more terrible to me are the large rooms of the common lodginghouses , in which without a pretence of curtain , screen , or partition , the beds of five or six families are placed , and adults and children live together , cooking at one common stove , fighting , brawling , drinking , and dying , in a state of unhealthy crowding which we would not think of permitting to our domestic animals . On that first Sunday it was an appalling thing to inc to see an almost uncountable number of drunken people . We found them lying dead - drunk in the hallways , drunk on the stairs , and drunk in their miserable homes ; one man lay drunk under the table , while three drunken women fought together in the room . In another place we found two men and three women all in the violent stage of drunkenness who berated us in the most l.ively manner , pointing to the crucifixes upon the wall and saying that that was all the religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion than many of their neighbors had . These , however , are not the only haunts visited by the Slum Brigadesaloons and dives being included in their every - day calling list . Several evenings a week are set aside for this much-needed field of work , and amid the whirling dance , and the obscenity and profanity of the lowest of these resorts their loving words and sweet pure voices have brought calm and hope , and a message of the better life to those who would otherwise have been unreached and uncared for . In the first experimental visits we did not go from room to room , knocking at the door and asking for admittance on the ground that we had come to read the Bible , to sing or pray with the people , nor did we take with us a bundle of tracts . Our plea was that we were looking for sick cases , which was perfectly true , and we hunted up every home , and room , and garret in which a sick baby or suffering person could be found . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give this spare time in caring for those we could nurse , and in the helping of our neighbors . At first the slum workers were regarded with suspicion , often met with absolute rebuff , but by degrees // their useful , loving , patient toil was rewarded by the gaining of the confidence of the people , and open doors and welcoming faces met them everywhere . One instance will serve to show how , though rebuffed at first , they persistently won their way into the homes of their neighbors . It was at the beginning of the work in the city of Boston . They had been there so short a time that they were not known in some of the larger tenement-houses in a district known as the Cove , where they themselves lived . They were systematically calling at room after room in a big tenementhouse when they happened on an open door , and stepping in they found a man trying , in a helpless way , to calm a crying baby . The room was a miserable wreck , filthy and neglected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently nothing for the child to eat . In answer to their kindly questions and sympathetic faces he told them it was all his wife 's fault ; she was a drinking and fighting woman , that the night before she had got into a drunken brawl with another woman , that they had been separated by the police , and both taken to the lock-up , she having her baby in her arms at the time . He added that he could not stand his child being taken off like that , so he went and brought it from the police station . Wasting but little time in words they set to work , commenced tidying the room , lit the fire to warm the baby 's milk , and were just engaged in making the little thing clean and comfortable when they heard an angry voice from the door ordering them to " get out . " Looking up they saw a perfect fury of a woman with dishevelled hair and blackened eyes standing on the threshold of the room , and , graspPig the situation at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resented their presence . " Get out of this , " she screamed , " get out , I tell you ! I want to have nobody come into my place when I 'm away . " As they tried kindly to explain matters to her , the husband in more than authoritative tones told her to " get out , " that she should not interfere with them , and that she was the one who should not darken his threshold any more . She , however , continued to abuse and berate them in the most violent language , adding that she would take them both by the hair of the head and throw them down-stairs unless they vacated the room immediately . Finding it then impossible to explain to her their real mission they left the room , asking her as they went if she knew of any sick cases upstairs which they could visit . " Go and find out for yourselves , " was her sullen reply , as they turned their faces toward their next piece of work . Coming down some time later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendless old man whom they found in the attic , they discovered the father and mother gone , and the baby lying in the room alone . They started down in search of the parents , and found the mother standing on the threshold of the street-door . They took the opportunity to talk with her again for a urnment , explaining to her how sorry they were to have caused her any annoyance or distress , and assuring her that they were really her friends , and that they would do anything to help her , gladly . " Well , " she said , " if you are my friends prove it to me . " " We will most certainly , " they answered , backing home the assurance by an invitation to come round to their own little room and have a cup of tea with them right away . Waiting only to fetch her baby she accompanied them to their little room , and after the refreshing influences of soap and water , tea and toast , she quite melted to their kindly words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " Will you forgive me , will you forgive me ? I did not know what sort of women you were . I bad not seen the like of such women as you , and I could not believe you were there for a good purpose . I thought you were there to take my place , and were just like all the other women round here . " And then she entered into the story of her sad life , with the great bhighting curse of drink , which had ruined home after home , and brought her to the lowest verge of misery and despair . When the time caine for her to return home she told them she dared not go . Her husband had told her he would never let her darken the door of // his room again , and she felt it would be as much as her life was worth to go back there . Leaving her in their roonis they went back to the husband , eliciting the promise from him to allow her to come in and stay if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news they promised her that they would pray earnestly that he might receive her kindly , and that it might be the starting-point of a new life . On their visit the next morning they found the room clean and tidy , the woman meeting them with a cheerful , glad smile , exclaiming , " Oh , your prayers must have something in them for my husband did not beat me , and says I am to stay right along . ' So the first seeds of peace and love took root , and this case is but one example of many hundreds which could be quoted from the experience of our workers . Much has been written concerning the overcrowding of the poor . In those portions of our cities which have justly gained for themselves the name of Slum , I must fully indorse all that I have seen written on the subject , and am sure the worst has not been told . There are tenement - houses in which some thirty and odd families reside , and when it is remembered that these families sometimes consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lodgers , the unhealthy and morally degrading conditions can better be understood . In two rooms it is quite common to find a mother and father , grown sons and daughters , and little children , with only two beds for the family , while the rest will be upon the floor or wherever they can sleep . In one case our officers found in two very tiny rooms a man and wife and son , the son sleeping in a mere cupboard of a room , and his mother acknowledged that she had let out half his bed to a couple of lodgers . The demoralizing influence on the little children is one of the saddest phases of this overcrowding . The woes endured and wrongs done to babyhood in the slums can never be written and will never be known until the revelations of eternity . Yet , among all their dirty , miserable surroundings , poverty , and crime , there is no more interesting place to study humanity than in this underworld of misfortune and sorrow . Little rays of generosity , gallantry , honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would consider totally hardened . Many of those whom you might think were debased and ignorant surprise you with their sharp wit , and the way in which they see through matters would often deceive more fortunate humanity . The " tough " of New York City , though he may be desperate and dangerous , can not be looked upon as a senseless , degraded sot . He is quick-witted , full of life , fun , and energy , and makes as good a friend and defender as he does a bitter enemy and persecutor . In contrasting the denizens of the Old World slums with those of the New , I should say that the brain capacity , wit , and spirit of the people is far in the ascendancy here , while the crime and desperateness for evil may be additionally strong . Again , it should be remembered that in some cities the slums are exceedingly cosmopolitan . This is particularly so in New York City and the city of Chicago . To meet this difficulty we have in our Slum Brigade representatives of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegian , Danish , Irish , Italian , and American , which enables our workers to reach many who could not possibly be reached , and dealt with in other than their own language . The work which began in New York City has not only spread to four different localities of that city , but has now branched out to Brooklyn , Boston , Buffalo , Philadelphia , Chicago , and St. Louis , and in all these different centres is being carried on , with the same devotion , whole - heartedness , and common-sense practical tact which has won for it the esteem and affection of the people of the New York slums . We find that each city has its peculiarity and its special phase of difficulty . Whereas the slums of New York may be worse in extent , in the crowding of population , and in their cosmopolitan character , yet the slums of Philadelphia are even more deplorable in some respects . The sanitary condition of the Philadelphia slums is simply appalling ; the officers // tell me that it has been a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutters of the city . The houses , through not being constructed for tenements , add another difficulty . In a house in which perhaps five or six families live , the stairs go through each dwelling-room , hence the family at the - top has to pass through the quarters of each of the other families on the way to their own room . This makes the publicity of their life greater and as a consequence , immorality is in creased . The slums in the city of Boston are in a much smaller area , and yet some of the most frightful cases ever reported to us come from that city . One which made a great deal of stir at the time in the daily press was a case discovered by our girls of a woman in a dying condition . The poor creature lay upon the floor , having received no food or attention for several days . She was too weak to call for help and could only ask them in a whisper for a drink of water . Not a particle of food was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , while in one corner a dozen empty whiskey bottles spoke of that which had wrought the ruin . In such a terrible condition of filth and corruption was the poor woman , that when they tried to lift her they found it impossible to do so , and had to return to their rooms to reinforce themselves with disinfectants to make the process of washing the poor body possible . She died some hours afterward in the hospital , but a great sensation was caused in the neighborhood from the fact that such a horrible case could exist unheeded , and unqualified praise was given to the army workers who had proved so willing to face the most repulsive task of rendering her help . In writing to me of this case , one of the brave girls closed with these words " Oh , I shall never again need spurring to go out after the lost . I thank God more than ever that I am a Slummer . ' After yesterday I can never be anything else . " It would be impossible to describe in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work entails upon the workers , or the brave heroism and love with which they accomplish it . They are not salaried workers , and could in no sense be called hirelings , for each one has volunteered simply and solely out of a burning desire to seek and bless these unloved , helpless outcasts . This fact helps them much , as this class is only too quick to inquire if you are " paid to do it . " Perhaps the duty which absorbs the greatest part of their time is that which we call visitation proper , viz. , the systematic house - to - house and room - to - room visitation of all the worst homes in their neighborhood . During the last six months 15,782 families were thus visited . A visit does not mean a mere pastoral call , but often means the spending of several hours in practical work . Sometimes it includes a whole night of patient nursing . It brings with it very often hard and difficult work in the way of scrubbing , cleaning , disinfecting . No one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible extent to which they are infested with vermin . For women brought up in very different circumstances and accustomed to absolute cleanliness , the self-sacrifice which this alone entails can be really understood . So it has been accepted in the slums that we can be called upon at any moment of day or night for help in emergency ; that we are turned to more readily than we had hoped in our most sanguine dreams . In sickness it is our duty to call in the doctor or to send for the ambulance , for they often run to us as their first resort . In drunken rows and murderous brawls the Army girls are more readily turned to by their rough neighbors than the police , and their infiutence is often more effectual . In cases of destitution and starvation found out casually by their neighbors , they are naturally consulted as to the best means of bringing help in the readiest and most practical manner , without the awkward and sometimes fatal delays of a red-tape system of relief-because they are right on the ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One morning a knock was heard at the door and two young " toughs " of the neighborhood asked the " Slum Sisters " to visit some women who were // very sick in a street close by . They promptly consented , though they thought perhaps the boys were up to some fun or mischief . They found , however , on going to the number given that the case was a genuine one . The stairway was so dark that they had to grope and literally crawl up . They found a small , miserably dirty room . It was raw and cold , for it was early spring time . A poor fire was smouldering in the grate . It had been lit by the " toughs , " who beneath their rude exterior had warm , kindly hearts . In a bed , the coverings of which were very dirty , sat a poor old woman , helpless and sick . They found that no one had been to help or minister to her , and that for some days she had been too sick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at the patience and meekness of the weak voice that answered them as they spoke kindly to her . She told them she had been unable to get out of bed for a week , but that mother had been sick much longer , and as she spoke she called out , " Mother ! " Something began to move beneath the pile . of rags that served as bed - clothes , and then out came a claw-like , grimy hand , and moving the sheets they saw a gaunt , white face , with a few straggling white hairs . It was the aged mother , dying of want and neglect . She had lain on the mattress so long in one position that it had worn into a deep hole ; the slats had given way and she had sunk through with it . They had literally ( after helping her *laughter from the bed ) to lift her out of this hole . The uncared-for condition revealed was terrible . No one had washed her , and she ' had been unable for weeks to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean sheets have to be furnished , clothing , common though clean , has to be given , and then food , which is often the first tasted in days , is served by the hands that have lovingly prepared it . This woman died a few days after being found , and her daughter was taken to the hospital in a hopeless condition . The visits paid in saloons and dives are naturally of a different character . There it has to be personal , dealing face to face with the people upon the danger of their wild lives , and the sorrow and misery that is coming to them . Sometimes it has to be very straight and earnest talk to some drunken man . At others gentle , affectionate pleading with some poor outcast girl , down whose painted cheeks the tears of bitter remorse fall , as the word " hope " is brought home to an almost hopeless heart . In many of the places thus visited , no other Christian workers would be admitted , and were they admitted they would indeed feel strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact appeals to the spark of gallantry in the hearts of those rough , hardened men , and if anyone dared to lay a finger upon the " Slum Sisters , " or say an insulting word to them , champions would arise on every hand to defend them , and fight their battles for them . Twenty-one thousand eight hundred and eleven visits have been made in saloons and dives during six months , and these visits are often lengthened into prayer-meetings , which include singing and speaking , to a more interesting congregation , and certainly a more needy one , than can be found within the walls of many a church . The practical good , the changed lives , the wonderful cases of conversion resulting from this work a thousandfold repays them for the facing of such revolting scenes of debauchery and drunkenness as must be witnessed . Street work is another phase of their mission which needs courage and a great deal of tact . In this they deal with the people whom they have not found within the saloons , and could not find in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floating population , who can be more readily reached on the streets than anywhere *else , especially when it is remembered that some of them have no lodgingplaces and make the streets their home . They are talked to in a friendly and yet very practical way during the evening hours , when there is a great deal of street lounging , and the opportunity offers . Forty thousand three hundred persons have been thus dealt with , and in many instances have been followed up to their homes , where the deeper // work has been done in their hearts , and their lives transformed in consequence . Yet another means of reaching these people is the gathering of them into our halls or meeting - places . Meetings are not opened until the other work has been some time in existence in a slum district ; and then when well known through their visitation , saloon work , and nursing , the slum officers hire a small hall , right among their neighbors , and invite them into it for the army meetings . The officers still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same women who do the visitation and other work . The audiences are chiefly composed of men , very often young men such as form the toughest gangs in down-town sections of the cities , an exceedingly interesting and needy audience , sharp and quick to catch the point in anything said and ready to detect instantly anything affected or insincere . To talk to such an audience would be a splendid training and a profound revelation to any preacher of the Gospel to-day if we could bring him upon our platform on a Sunday night . The bright , lively songs of the Salvation Army , the everchanging phaces of the meetings , and the thorough bond of sympathy between the speakers on the platform and the roughs in the hall , make these meetings a source of great power and interest . Of course , there are occasionally fights among the audience , chairs are upset every now and then , windows are broken , a constant fire of remarks is carried on , and a great many exceedingly amusing as well as tragic events take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet through it all a deep , powerful wave of influence carries into the hearts of the people the sincerity and truth of things spiritual . Those who have come out , and through our penitent form joined the ranks of the Salvation Army and become soldiers in the slums , do so almost at the risk of their lives , and we have already had one martyr . Some have confessed crimes , even the crime of murder , at our penitent forms , and have been willing to rise up , go out , and make restitution for the wrong committed , even o the giving themselves into the hands of the authorities . Collections are taken up right among the poor themselves in these meetings , and they almost always amount to sufficient during the month to pay the hall rents . We believe , as far as possible , in making them feel an interest and responsibility in such matters , and we find enough pride and independence on their part to make them shoulder it gladly , and take a real interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were begun recently , on one of the first nights we had an audience of thirty-two people and every individual in the audience was drunk . This will show the need , and also demonstrate the fact that it requires some tact and wisdom to deal with such peoplc effectually . Very touching are some of the stories of the help given to the army by these people of the slums . It is the custom with us to set aside one week in the year as a " week of self-denial , " in which all Salvationists deny themselves something by which they can save money , and send it into one common fund for the helping forward and maintenance of the work . In this " our boys , " aswe call them , have helped nobly , even before their conversion . During the last self-denial week in the slums of New York $100 was raised , and , in some instances , the unconverted men , even , saved their beer - money for the week and handed it over . An interesting case of conversion took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man being a hardened drunkard . In testifying afterward he gave as a reason for his first atten dance at army meetings , the fact that he had stood at the door of a saloon right opposite our Day Nursery , and watched the little children swinging in front of the brightly curtained windows , and he said , in his own language , " Boys , I had never seen babies treated like that before , and I felt there must be some good in the women who did it , so I just came to see what made them so good . " This nursery work is one which is having a deep reflex influence on the lives and hearts of the population in their neighborhood , as well // as proving a great blessing to the little ones who are taken in out of their miserable homes and lodging-houses and safely cared for during the day . Our idea in starting the Nursery ( and it was the first day nursery in the down-town slums of New York ) was to take these little ones during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to enable the mothers to gain an honest living , and yet to shelter the poor little ones from the misfortunes and dangers that await them if their mothers go to work leaving them behind . I shall never forget one pitiful little child who used to be locked in a room without food and without care or companionship , while his mother went out for the whole day . This child , not yet able to walk or talk , used to crawl about on the dirty floor , wailing pitifully with hunger , and yet hurrying away under the bed or table in abject terror when his mother came in . The Slum Sisters at times called when the mother was out , and found the door locked ; they knocked upon it , and the little one would come and coo to them through the door . The misery of little children can not be described or imagined , and yet there is worse still . Little ones have been brought to us whose poor little bodies have been black and blue from head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiny girls under two years of age have been brought to our nursery , having been so maltreated that it would have been better had the villains into whose hands they had fallen murdered them outright . Cases of drunkenness in mere babies have also made our hearts ache - children who had not only inherited the terrible taint , or been nursed by drinking mothers , but who had had the spirits poured down their little throats to still them when crying , so that they lived almost always in a state of torpor and their death was only a matter of time . In such cases we can only look upon the death angel as an angel of light ! In some instances , by the taking of the little children into this nursery , we have saved young women from the easy yet unspeakably wretched life of the streets . Finding themselves mere weak girls with the burden of a little life to support , they have stood face to face with the problem of how to live when they have almost wished that it were easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed closed , while on the other an easy way to make money , and plenty of it , has been opened out before them . One young girl of seventeen brought her baby to us . She had had no home for the last six weeks ( since her child 's birth ) , and yet she clung with a desperate love to the little creature , and it was an unspeakable comfort to her to come and fetch it every night , and take it to the little home she was able then to provide for it by the earnings of her hard day 's work . The nursery is not furnished with elegant brass - bound cots , but is in keeping with all the other furnishings in our slum work . As we began the nursery so have we kept it on the same lines of neighborly help , keeping carefully from it anything that might speak of wealthy outside patrons and help , which would lead the people to feel that they could impose upon us , or abandon their children upon our hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little mattress , clean sheets , and blankets , ornamented with a barrelstave which is cleverly contrived as an awning , over which mosquito - netting is hung . Swings , accommodating the babies old enough to occupy them , baby-creepers , and rocking-horses , and toys of all sorts ( some sent from the nurseries of the more fortunate ) are used for the little ones , and in fine weather they are taken on to the Brooklyn Bridge , or on trips on the horse-cars to breathe some fresher air than that which they are accustomed to . Babies from the earliest age up to three years , in every possible stage of babyhood , can be found there . They are provided with clean clothing , are given a bath ( very often the only baths they ever receive in their little lives ) , and good food , with plenty of motherly love and tender , gentle nursing , which is perhaps more to these tiny starved hearts than is the food even to the little hungry bodies . Two thousand three hundred and forty little children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cr*che during the last six months . In cities where the slum nurseries have not yet been opened , a great deal is done for the little ones in their own homes . In Chicago , a family was discovered where the mother had six little ones , and her husband was in jail . The room in which she lived was so infested with rats that she had to carry her children up to the roof to sleep with them there ; and when the winter came and she could no longer do so , she had to sit up all night to drive the rats off . The little garments which were given to the children by our slum officers she with tears showed them one morning had been literally eaten to pieces by the rats . Not only were our officers able to clothe and care for these little ones , but they succeeded in getting the whole family into suitable lodgings and obtained work for the parents . During the last six months 6,402 garments have been wisely given to absolutely needy cases , and food has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12,405 meals during the same period . Not only do they thus minister to the people in life , but they are constantly called to watch with the dying and to perform the last acts of care for the dead . In contrast to these duties are the many calls to come and lend their loving care as frail little beings are ushered into life . The support of this work is not costly when compared with the amount of good accomplished . Nothing is expended in buildings , offices , high salaries , or indeed in any way that would use the money before it could reach the actual object for which it was given . The expenses connected with the slum work are the bare necessaries of the workers ' existence in simple food and clothing , and the rental of their humble rooms . This is contributed by friends ( sometimes by strangers ) who hear of the work ; and ( as I said before ) help in the rentals of meeting-places in the slum districts is collected from the people themselves . Of the work accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnarled and ungainly oystershells from the mud and ooze of the sea-bottom are forced to yield up to the earnest seeker their priceless pearls , so from the midst of the darkness and degradation of the slums purified and precious gems will be gathered , and those who toiled and found shall be among the " blessed " and the rich of Heaven.
