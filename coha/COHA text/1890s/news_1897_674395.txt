txt Five Democrats ' three Senators and two Assemblymen  --  bolted the Democratic caucus to-night because of their objection to the nomination of United States Senator David B. Hill as the candidate to succeed himself . The others , without the formality of nominating speeches , made Senator Hill the party candidate by a vote of 36 for Mr. Hill , 3 for Wilbur F. Porter of ' Watertown , and 2 for Robert T. Titus of Buffalo . Those who walked out of the caucus were Senators Charles L. Guy of the Twenty-first District of New York ; Michael J. Coffey of the Fifth and Peter H. of the Sixth District of Kings , and Assemblymen Cain and turn of Kings . Senators Guy and made brief speeches just before they went out , declaring they would ? not support a man who occupied the position of Mr. Hill in the late campaign . ? Senator Guy 's Protest . Senator Guy said : " After a conference with some of my associates who are opposed to they renomination of Senator Hill , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a nomination , and if it is going to be made , I must withdraw from the caucus . I have no desire to be a censor of the acts of a public official . " In the matter of the Democratic leadership in the State Senate , I have already shown that I have no desire to keep alive the unfortunate party differences which prevailed during the recent campaign , and that I favor a policy of conciliation and forgetfulness , so . far as State matters are concerned . But the election of a United States Senator is National in its significance , National in its consequences , and the question of loyalty or disloyalty to the Democracy of the Nation can not be ignored in connection with such an event . " During the recent campaign , while not approving of some features of the Chicago platform , I believed it my duty to loyally support the Presidential candidate of the Democratic Party , because I knew him to be an intelligent , upright , and honorable man , and because I felt that the Democratic Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the great body of the people . More than 6,000,000 of voters in the Nation and 551,000 in this State displayed like faith in the Democratic Party and its candidate . " Senator Hill , on the contrary , by his inaction and policy of delay , contributed more than any other single influence to Democratic defeat . To vote for him under the circumstances would , in my opinion , be to rebuke those who were loyal ; to reward the general who avoided the conflict , while condemning the brave soldiers who unflinchingly facecl , the foe . " Senator said : " I decline to further follow in National or State politics a man who is responsible for the defeat of a party that five years ago was intrenched in power in the State , while to-day a Democrat in office is a rarity . I decline to fol. loiv a man who was the first to denounce Grover Cleveland , but has now become his greatest apologist . I decline to follow a man Who was at first a. silver Senator , but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall withdraw from the caucus . " Plans of the Bolters . The opponents of Mr. Hill had been in conference before the caucus , and had deliberately decided on a course of action . They authorized Senator Guy to act as their spokesman , and they served public notice to all who were interested that they would not submit to the caucus action . Arguments on the part of Senator Cantor , Assemly Leader Finn , and others who were for Hill were idle . They refused to follow the leadership of Senator Hill or to recognize him as in good standing as a Democrat . The bolters met outside the Senate Chamber while the caucus was in session , and discussed a policy to be followed on the formal ballot to-morrow , but did not reach a determination further than to support some " regular " Democrat . The men who remained in the caucus , but voted for a candidate other than Senator Hill , represent constituencies in Kings and Erie Counties . Assemblymen Coughlin and Maloney of Erie voted for Judge Titus . He was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court of Appeals in the last campaign . Local political considerations are said to have influenced them . They are allied with the faction in Buffalo of which Norman E. Mack is one of the leaders . Recently Mr. Mack has had a contest with the so-called " Sheehan " faction for control of the organization , and Mr. Mack won . He came to town to-day with the two Assemblymen , as soon as he was certain that it was the intention of the Democrats to renominate Mr. Hill . He was at the caucus to-night . Those who voted for Wilbur F. Porter , who was the " regular " Democratic candidate for Governor in the last campaign , were all front . Kings County  --  Senator P. H. McCarren and Assemblyman Thomas H. Cullen and Frederick Schmid . Their action is regarded as notice to the machine that it can not longer control their actions . Senator Timothy D. Sullivan and Assemblyman Timothy P. Sullivan of New York and Assemblyman James Lennon , Jr. , of Kings were not present .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
