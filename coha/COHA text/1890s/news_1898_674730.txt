txt ' mete roe te . . A.equired  --  Some of These Literary Sweetmeats Discussed , From The London News . Maxims are the wit of the few and the weariness of the many . But Just as there are two things which can not be gazed on steadily , death and the sun , so there are many things of which a little goes a long way . Such things are olives and aphorisms . Maxims are not like Mme. de Sevign ? ' s cherries ; you do not begin by choosing the best and end by eating the basketful . An aphorism is like a sonnet , though , luckily , there is not nearly so much of It . Both begin in a happy thought , and both are worked up with what literary skill the thinker possesses . Both are like puns ? the ' habit of making them grows upon a man . Puns can be fired Off anywhere : sonnets can only be exploded in " The Athenaeum . " In sonnets the original happy thought needs to be padded out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In aphorisms the thought needs to be cut like a diamond , if it Is to sparkle . Mankind has forgotten all but a very few aphorisms of known and individual authorship , whereas proverbs abound by the thousand . Nobody knows who made proverbs , but in every country he seems to have made the same . Proverbs are natural wild flowers of human reflection everywhere , but aphorisms demand the labor of individual thought . After Rochefoucauld published his Maxims in 1605 , making maxims became a fashionable intellectual amusement , like " pencil games . " the most fatiguing of entertainments . The cheapest way to make maxims is to invert truisms , ( once very popular. ) or to alter proverbs . Thus it seems for a moment rather amusing to say , " A little widow is a dangerous thing , " but the line parodied is " A little knowledge , " not " A. little wisdom , " " is a dangerous thing . " Though proverbs are made by nobody knows who , Pope and others of his school made , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speed the parting guest , Man never Is , but always to be blest . This very well expresses the hopes and disappointments of hospitality . In politics , take : What oft was thought , but ne'er so well expressed . Whate'er is best administered is best . The reader of our classics will perceive that , in the way illustrated by these quotations , the poets may be made to say something much in their manner , but which they never dreamed of saying . Thus , of the great Swedish Queen 's abdication , She left a name at which the world grew pale , To suckle fools and chronicle small ale . By such expedients even the feeblest minds ( as one of them remarked ) may fire off aphorisms like a Maxim gun . Pascal 's things are " pensees , " not aphorisms , to be used as occasion arose ; in fact , deeply serious happy thoughts . " The last thing we decide when writing a book is what we shall put first . " So also said Thomas Innes , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apply probably to novels . " We are easily consoled , because we are easily afflicted . " But people who are not easily afflicted are not easily consoled . " Continued eloquence is wearisome. ' thing . : 10 ' Coleridge . " If all neW " What ; ea.elli. said . of the other , there wouldnot-betfoUrfriends in the world . " This seems equivai lent . to saying that mankind , as observed , by Pascal , had no sense of humor . Pascal ; found that " the abstract sciences afforded little opportunity of social intercourse. ' 71 , How ' could he expect it ? It is the same. ; with golf , if earnestly pursued . " Atheism , shows strength of mind , but only to a cer- ? tain degree . " It rather argues strength ' of conceit . " To commonplace people , all men are much alike . " This is hardly true ; commonplace people always pronounce everybody " an awfully queer fellow . " There are few Rochefoucauld maxims so good as " Hypocrisy is the homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great eagerness to repayea favor is a kind of ingratitude . " , It is not , perhaps , the most usual variety . " There are bad people who would be less dangerous if they were devoid of all goodness , and good people who would be more agreeable if they had " a redeeming vice . " " The reason why lovers never get tired of one another 's society is because they always talk about themselves . " And that is the reason why some married people do get tired of each other 's society . Rochefoucauld is not always bitter . There is nobility in " We , in some measure , take part in good actions when we praise them sincerely . " English does not lend itself to aphorisms , or Englishmen do not know how to use their language . The best modern examples are probably those in Mr. George Meredith 's " Pilgrim 's Scrip , " which , we believe , have not been separately published                 @ @ @ @
