THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS . L THE WITNESS OF THE TEACHER . THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY recently circulated widely among superintendents and teachers of the public schools in every part of the country inquiries ( 1 ) as to the average number of pupils per teacher in the several grades of the public schools ; ( 2 ) in what proportion the teachers have changed their profession during the last ten years ; ( 3 ) in what proportion they are more than thirty-five years of age ; ( 4 ) as to the freedom of teachers from political or other improper influences on their appointment or removal ; ( 5 ) as to the salaries of teachers of the sev // eral grades , whether they have been increased within five or six years , whether they are regarded as sufficient , and whether higher salaries would attract to the profession men and women of greater ability and of more stable purpose ; ( 6 ) as to the requirements for appointments , whether they are rigid and uniform , and whether a certificate is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 7 ) as to the chances that teachers have for promotion from the lower grades , and whether it is the custom to fill the higher grades by promotion : whereto was added a request to give any further information in regard to the status of teachers which would naturally supplement these inquiries . Accompanying this circular was the following letter : - " The Atlantic Monthly , following its plan of paying especial attention to educational subjects , will take up for discussion the Status of the Teacher , and consider how the profession may be made a calling of greater dignity and of more suitable reward ; for , clearly , teaching is not held in as high honor as it ought to be . It is doubtful , indeed , if the public school system will reach its proper efficiency until in every community the teacher 's status is as high as the status of any other profession . To lift the teacher into the highest esteem , two things are necessary : - " ( 1 . ) To give efficient teachers security in their positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . ) To pay them salaries large enough to make the profession attractive to the very ablest men and women , not as a makeshift , but as a life career . " In discussing a subject of such importance , it is desirable to have as large a volume of facts at first-hand as possible . We therefore take the liberty to ask you to answer these questions concerning the 1 Since these letters were placed in Dr. Hall 's bands between three and four hundred more replies have been received , but they do 403 teachers in the public schools in your community . " The replies , which have been both full and numerous , have been placed in my hands , together with a summary of their results , and are the basis of the following study . Their value was not expected to consist in accuracy , but rather in showing tendencies correctly . The statistical information that can be extracted from them is of less account than the fact that we have here fresh confessions and first-hand observations and experiences from men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak on these matters , but in the existing state of things least often heard from . There is every internal indication that the reports are absolutely frank and honest . They thus constitute a valuable protocol of data for points of view no less reliable than they are new , and which are , I think , certain to command the attention of friends of education throughout the country . The investigation should prove as useful as it is opportune . In all 1189 teachers and superintendents have answered these questions , and every State and Territory in the Union is represented except New Mexico and Oklahoma , and the replies are , on the whole , well distributed over the different parts of the Union , although they are less numerous from the Southern and the far Western States than from the middle Western and New England States . ' In all sections , the replies appear to be , with few exceptions , from the best teachers , and most of them are from men . To begin with the first question , which asks the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , averaging these where they are given , and for each return and the returns for each State , we find that Maine reports fewest ( 35 ) and Montana most ( 58 ) . Avernot seriously affect the result of his analysis . - EDITOR . // aging States by sections , we find that the Middle and New England States have fewest pupils per teacher ( 41 each ) and the far Western and Pacific States most ( 45 ) . Rhode Island has most among the New England States ( 52 ) . In the Middle States the extremes are Virginia and Delaware ( 39 each ) and Pennsylvania ( 44 ) . In the Southern States the extremes are Arkansas ( 51 ) and Florida ( 34 ) . In the Western States the extremes are Kansas ( 50 ) and South Dakota ( 40 ) ; and in the far Western States , Montana ( 58 ) and Washington ( 34 ) . Everywhere , of course , the number of pupils per teacher in city schools is greater than in country schools . These numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too large , it need not be said , for any teacher to do good work with . A crude young teacher is constrained , and embarrassed even , in the presence of so many pairs of eyes , and a large share of her energy goes to keep order . To watch the mischievous pupils during every recitation is a constant distraction from the subject in hand . The flitting of the attention from one pupil to another , even for a woman , the periphery of whose retina is more sensitive for the indirect field of vision than a man 's , is a steady strain . Moreover , what knowledge can the average teacher of such a large number have of individual pupils ? And how little can she do to bring out that individuality wherein lies the power of teaching , and the unfolding of which makes or mars the later career of the pupil ! No wonder the complaint of machine methods in our schools is so often heard . Both attention and love were made to have an individual focus , while mass-education has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every step , therefore , toward reduction in numbers is a great gain . Passing to the second question , as to the proportion of teachers who have changed their profession during the last ten years , it would appear that 30 per cent of those in New England have left the profession within a decade . In the Middle States this average is 40 per cent , in the Southern States it is 50 per cent , in all the Western States it is 65 per cent , and in the far Western and Pacific States it is 60 per cent . While many women leave school to marry , the fact that Massachusetts , where the female teachers outnumber the male a little more than ten to one , shows the lowest average of change , and that Alabama , where 62 per cent are males , reports 42 per cent as having changed , indicates that where male teachers predominate they are responsible for most of the changes . It is well known that many young men teach as a makeshift for a few years , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay college debts or get money to study further , or to acquire the means for entering one of the other professions . Other statistics have shown that nearly one third of the teachers in many sections of the country change their vocation every year . The fact that so small a fraction of the teachers in the public schools have had any normal or professional training shows , also , how few regard it as a lifework . Of the $95,000,000 paid for salaries of teachers for 15,000,000 children of this country , a large proportion is thus spent upon untrained and unskilled teachers who have little interest in making their work professional . No business could ever succeed or was ever conducted on such principles , and when we reflect that the " prentice hand " is here tried upon human flesh , blood , and souls the waste in all these respects is appalling . Those who claim that teaching can be learned only by experience are in part right , but even the school of experience is wretchedly inadequate in this country . Moreover , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we are far behind other countries . It is only when a teacher has mastered the details of government and method that good work can be done . // When we come to the answers to the question , What proportion of teachers are over thirty-five years of age ? the average estimate of the Middle States , 27 per cent , is the highest , and the average of the Western States , 17 per cent , is the lowest ; while the far Western States average 18 per cent , and iNew England and the South 21 per cent . It would he an interesting question to ask how many of this large per cent of teachers more than thirty-five years of age have remained in the vocation because they succeeded as teachers , and how many are there because they could do no better in other callings . The fact that financial depression increases the average age of teachers as well as the number of male teachers , while good times decrease both , is significant . The social position of teachers is higher in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position can not account for these extremes . We have been told that the young make the best teachers for children ; but if so , why not reinstate the monitorial system of pupil teachers ? Again , we are sometimes told that older teachers are unprogressive ; but this is not true of the best , who are also often needed as a conservative element against rash innovations . Nothing is more demanded in our teaching force at present ( which , as has recently been pointed out , is nine times as large as our standing army ) than leadership of maturity and ability . Those who have shaped the thinking and the reading of our young teachers have been , on the whole , incompetent for this highest and most responsible function in our national life . Until very recent years we had few teachers who had personally inspected foreign systems , could read other languages than English , and were acquainted with all grades of education from kindergarten to university work . In these respects , happily , the prospects are now brightening . Very striking are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 405 their positions and secu*ity from improper influences . In New England , percentages reporting improper influence are as follows by States : Maine 33 per cent , New Hampshire 9 per cent , Vermont 8 per cent , Massachusetts 17 per cent , Rhode Island none , and Connecticut 40 per cent . This evil is potent , however , for appointments rather than for removals . These bad influences are prominent in the following order : church , politics , personal favor , and whims of citizens and committees . The master of a grammar school writes strongly against the policy of placing schools in the hands of division committees . Their chairman , he says , is virtually the committee , and almost always lives in the district . The rules forbid the employment of non-resident teachers at anything but the minimum salary . He favors a wider range of choice , and thinks appointments should be made by a general committee advised by supervisor and principal . The system of annual elections is often comihented on adversely . In the Middle States , 9 per cent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 per cent in Delaware , and 50 per cent in Pennsylvania report improper influences . Some *ad revelations appear in these returns . One teacher tells of an applicant who was " asked , not as to his qualifications , but of the number of voters in his family . " Another writes that the friends of a schoolbook publishing house would " drive out any teacher who would not favor their books . " The civil service regulations in New York have bettered the conditions ; and a teacher who has had experience in Ohio , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and New York says that , on the whole , New York teachers are far above the average in intelligence and professional spirit . In some of the Southern States very evil influences are reported . Jn small towns in Alabama teachers are said to be both removed and appointed by favor ; positions in some places are rarely held // more than two terms , and some teachers take three different schools during the year . Lessons are short . " In some counties the teachers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.50 to $5 to keep their positions , " and 6 per cent report improper influence , as do 30 per cent in Georgia , 70 per cent in Kentucky , 25 per cent in Maryland , 40 per cent in Mississippi , 50 per cent in South Carolina and Tennessee , 45 per cent in Texas , 20 per cent in Virginia , and 60 per cent in West Virginia . In Kentucky , where teachers are commonly elected annually , " when boards change politically , sweeping changes of teachers often follow . " In Mississippi teachers are said rarely to remain in positions more than one year . In Texas one teacher reports : " If your school board are Democratic , the teachers are Democratic ; if Baptists , they must be Baptists . " In WestVirginia it is said that requirements are neither rigid nor uniform . " Politics is the bane of the school system ; then comes personal favoritism . Colored teachers are special sufferers from politics . " For the far Western States the report of improper influence is as follows : California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota 100 per cent ( only four reports ) , Oregon 40 per cent , Utah 60 per cent , Washington 60 per cent . In California the state law gives the teacher life tenure of office , but this law is said to be " always evaded by politicians . " Good state laws are overcome by corrupt school boards . Teachers are said to be " pliant , timid , and servile , " and political " pulls " are potent . One report says that teachers ' boarding-places affect their security ; another calls them " cranks " and cowards . ' ' Requirements are said to be " wholly unpedagogical , absurd , and criminally careless . " In Colorado it is the same old story of the political " pull . " Large cities seem freer from political influence than small towns . Local teachers are preferred to outsiders , which is a bad sign . In Idaho the condition looks bad , and personal favoritism is said to keep teachers in office . In Oregon , where tenure is uncertain and teachers are often elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tenure . In Utah one report says that positions in some places are solely dependent on political influence . In Washington a city superintendent says : " We have practically no protection from political demagogues ; this unfortunate condition is appalling in our Western country . " He says further that tenure of position is affected by " personal friends and their influence , and by the lack of them . " " We must trade with the merchants , bank with the bankers , take treatment of the doctors , consult the lawyers , connive with the politicians , and even go to school elections and work for the successful candidate . " For the Western States , the report of improper influences by percentages is as follows : Illinois 44 per cent , Indiana 33 per cent , Iowa 40 per cent , Kansas 80 per cent , Michigan 50 per cent , Minnesota 33 per cent , Mississippi 40 per cent , Missouri 50 per cent , Nebraska 65 per cent , Nevada 100 per cent , Ohio 40 per cent , Wisconsin 40 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , and of local preference , always a sign of politics . Tenure is said to be affected by the evil doings of book publishers and agents . Chicago , however , is " a striking instance of a large city that has succeeded in putting its public schools on a fairly sound basis . The main difficulty is getting rid of poor teachers , although the rank and file seem more cultivated than the supervisors . " In Iowa standards are low , home teachers are preferred , and few teachers remain more than a year in a place . In Michigan tenure of office is becoming more secure and legislation better , and smaller towns seem more free from political influence than large cities . It is reported from one of the large central Western cities that a member of the school board could not read or write . // In Nebraska church relations are said to affect tenure more than politics . In Minnesota the religious " pull " is reported more potent than the political , and preference for local teachers appears. * In Ohio it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching force , the teacher is " not recognized as a factor in social or political life . He is deprived of the privilege of free speech on all subjects , but especially on the one subject that concerns him most , namely , reforms in teaching . The people who should be the leaders in educational thought do not call their souls their own . They catch their breath in quick starts when they see a power over them wielding the club of dismissal . " From Wisconsin it is reported , as one reason why teachers are not highly esteemed , that they " are often too much interested in commercial transactions of publishing houses* " Another report says that the greatest drawback to teaching in the West is the impossibility of becoming an integral part of the community in which one lives . " Unless the teacher is a flatterer and keeps quiet on all political questions , he loses his position . " " In some communities teachers are hired by the day or week . " From such answers it is impossible to resist the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as merit does not win there is little encouragement for teachers to make any kind of special preparation , or for communities to support normal and training schools . A teacher , however well fitted for the work , is hampered if there is any anxiety concerning his tenure of position , and any system in which merit does not lead to both permanence and promotion is bad , and certain to grow worse . Tenure by personal favor is even more corrupting than tenure by political or religious influences . Teachers ought to be , both by ability and by position , moral forces in the community , and their opinion ought to be best and final concerning textbooks and school supplies ; and yet , touching the latter , not only teachers , but superintendents evade their responsibilities . For myself , I wish to say that , after many years of acquaintance with school work in this country , I consider the present modes of introducing textbooks and other supplies as among the most degrading influences in the work of American public schools . Under existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor books , the former would have exceeding small chance of success if not pushed by unworthy and now very expensive methods which are paid for by enhanced prices for books . The answers relating to salaries show a great preponderance of opinion that these are insufficient . Sometimes exception is made in the case of poor teachers or of certain grades , but in most cases the opinion and even the language is emphatic that an increase in salaries would help the service . A Maine report says : " The great trouble is that our best teachers leave for better salaries almost as soon as they have learned their work . " A Vermont teacher fears that any increase would bring a reaction against the schools on the ground of over-taxation , and so cripple them . Another adds that " higher salaries must go hand in hand with higher professional requirements ; otherwise an increase of salaries would attract a large number of persons of inferior qualifications . " In Massachusetts only 9 per cent consider higher salaries inadvisable . One woman touchingly thinks a real lover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston principal says : " Most masters take a pride in their profession , and I know a few instances of their refusing higher salaries in different businesses . " An academy teacher says : " Higher salaries will make it possible to get men where women now hold , and to secure better men as superintendents and principals of the high school . Women are better than men , except in these // two places . " One man says : " Salaries ought not to be uniform . Every teacher ought to be paid what he is worth . This is possible only when the pay-roll is not made public . This is done in a few cities ; Hartford , Connecticut , for example . " In all parts of the country the vote is overwhelmingly in favor of more pay . This opinion is most nearly unanimous in the Southern States , where salaries are lowest , but it is also strong where salaries are highest . A Pennsylvania teacher says : " There is small pay and there is little gratitude for public school teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorhouse is a man who had devoted a long life to teaching in the public schools of that county . Now old and infirm , he finds himself , through no fault of his , an object of charity . " Poor pay is both a cause and a result of lack of appreciation . In many localities salaries have been reduced . In most places and in most grades they are reported as stationary , while Wisconsin and New Jersey are the only States in which a general increase is reported . On the whole , I am impressed with the opinion of a Massachusetts teacher , who says : " Better schoolhouses , better equipments , better superintendents , and more general freedom and responsibility have done more than an increase of salary to improve the schools . " Mr. Hewes 1 has shown that the average salary of the American teacher , counting fifty-two weeks to the year , is $5.67 per week for such male teachers as remain in the ranks , and $4.67 for female teachers . " As a partial index of the disposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reassuring . The highest average salary , according to the Report of the Commissioner of Education , is $1181 per year in Massachusetts , and the lowest $213 per year in North Carolina . " The average pay of teachers in our public schools 1 In a series of papers on the Public Schools which appeared recently in Harper 's Weekly . furnishes them with the sum of $5 a week for all their expenses . " In 1885 salaries were higher than they are now , but in 1889 the average salaries of American teachers were lower , so that , on the whole , we are just now improving . The $95,000,000 spent in this country for teachers in the public schools every year must be divided among 368,000 teachers , - more than twice as many as in any other country of the world . Although these figures take no account of the fact that many rural teachers are engaged in other vocations a large part of the year , they are appalling enough . And the reason for the displacement of male by female teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed to extinction , is apparent . At present , the American school system as a whole owes its high quality in no small measure to the noble character , enthusiasm , and devotion of women who make teaching not only a means of livelihood , but in addition thereto a mission service of love for their work and for children . To increase this love is to increase the best part of their services , and to diminish it is to degrade it to mere drudgery and routine . As the culture of women gradually rises , it becomes more and more evident how unjust have been the discriminations against them in this field , where in higher and higher grades of school work their services are becoming no less valuable than men 's . The question concerning rigid and uniform requirements and normal certificates evokes very diverse answers . In Maine they are reported as rigid in only a few cases . In New Hampshire one report says : " We need a state system of examining and licensing teachers . A large proportion in all district schools are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly untrained . Some of them have natural tact sufficient to carry them through , but the majority fail , and accept the first offer of marriage . " A superin // tendent says that Boston and the towns about it take his best teachers , as the salaries he can pay will not hold them . In Vermont a report says : " We have practically no supervision . The town superintendents are not paid enough to enable them to devote their time and thought to the work . " In Massachusetts 45 per cent report requirements as rigid and uniform , and normal school or college training as required . Normal school or college graduates are oftea preferred in other cases , but rarely insisted upon . A few years of successful experience are sometimes regarded as equivalent to a certificate . One principal favors giving teachers special subjects , and disregarding grades . One superintendent says : " Nearly all our new teachers are directly from the normal schools . If they are efficient at the end of one or two years , they leave for positions paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained . " One teacher says : " Efficiency of schools is destroyed by the fear or inability of authorities to remove weak , popular teachers . " A city superintendent says : " We get our teachers from any place in the country . This gives us a wide choice . " And he adds : " It is senseless to let committeemen elect teachers . The superintendent should appoint them . " He deplores that so much power is in the hands of local boards " whose members know nothiiig of educational theory , history , or practice . " In Rhode Island about half the correspondents report normal school or college training as required . In one city a yearly examination is held . " Candidates are required to obtain 70 per cent , to have their names placed on the substitute list . After assisting three or four times , these substitutes are given regular positions . " A Connecticut principal says : " The situation is peculiar in Connecticut . The district committee engages teachers , and the town committee examines them . This examination does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generally expect teachers with normal school training . " Another says : Too many young people without proper scholarship enter our normal schools . None but graduates of high schools should be admitted . Teachers ought to be retired and pensioned after a certain number of years of service . " Another says : " We have annual election of teachers : this is wrong , after a teacher has succeeded one or two years . " In New England , as a whole , about 42 per cent report normal school or college training as required . Vermont is said to have a state law requiring teachers to have such training . But it is as effective as the rules and regulations of the Boston public schools , which are said to require fifty-six pupils to a teacher . Leaving New England and passing to the Middle States , we find New Jersey reporting requirements as generally uniform , and certificates as invariable . But its one normal school supplies only a small part of the teachers . In New York complaint is made that the normal school turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years to make them effective . The system of annual elections is to be abandoned in the State , and the primary departments are weakest . In Delaware there is a rigid state law , and the indications from uniform state examinations are hopeful . In Pennsylvania requirements seem generally uniform , but not rigid , while lack of popular sentiment soon robs teachers of ambition or courage . Alabama and Georgia report no rigid requirements or examinations , and no good state law . Louisiana is no better . In South Carolina the teachers ' standard of scholarship is low , and few hold first-rate certificates . Tennessee has annual examinations , but lacks uniformity , and a county certificate is all that is required . Both the Virginias lack rigidity and uniformity . In the far West a state law ( in California ) gives a life tenure , and requires equal pay for men and women , but the condi // March , tion of life tenure is said to be very commonly evaded . In Colorado only larger towns are improving under state statutes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and normal certificates are not required . Utah lacks uniformity ; so does Washington , where the principal of a city high school says : " The greatest curse of the public school of any State is the laws pertaining to the normal schools . Most of these are conducted by little politicians , and they in one or two short years train boys and girls fresh from farm and high school into teachers licensed to teach forever . The raw , untrained , normal school graduate has more recognition before the law than would a W. D. Whitney . The country school and teacher are here , as they are everywhere , indescribable . The teacher is not paid sufficient to dress well . He is not required to know much , nor does he often pass beyond his requirements . The average district board member is sure to have some niece , about eighteen or nineteen years of age , who would make a right smart teacher , ' or who would be able to learn em all that their paps and mains know 'd . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and country , are found individuals who could not fail in their work . They are pouring their life freely and fully into their profession . In the mid-Western States it appears that normal school graduates are not generally successful . In Illinois good men for principals are very scarce , and it is often said that superintendencies and school boards should not be political offices . In Indiana it seems that while the superintendents are often narrow , ignorant , and corrupt men , even the good ones labor under great difficulties in trying to raise the standard of an uninterested and unenthusiastic body of teachers . The rank and file seem to care little for their professional status . They complain bitterly of personal injustice , but they hardly breathe the proper spirit . Requirements are not rigid or uniform , and county certificates are enough . In Iowa , where county superintendents are the most important school officers , they depend on politics for their position . Standards are neither uniform nor rigid . In Kansas requirements are rarely uniform outside of cities , and ignorant boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , on the whole , seems poor . In Michigan want of rigid and uniform requirements is the main difficulty , although state legislation is improving . Missouri lacks state requirements , and there is more criticism of normal school graduates . In Nebraska requirements are flexible , and the superintendency is a political office . In Minnesota , as in other States where the normal school abounds , there is much theoretical work , but requirements are uniform and rigid . The topics of this question present peculiar difficulties . Uniformity of requirements in widely different localities , and especially between city and country schools , is almost unattainable , and certainly is not found in the best countries in Europe . The ability of classes in different localities varies , and the supply of teachers is still more inconstant . The same is true of rigidity . Even German universities raise and loWer professional standards according to the supply and demand . It must be admitted , too , that normal schools have often but crude material to deal with , and have lapsed into formal and theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the worst features of education in this country . No system of certification can equal professional training . But , despite this , these are the ideals toward which legislation should strive ; and in this country , at least , nearly all the steps toward centralization have been marks of progress ; although in France this had been so extreme that the reverse is now true . The happy mean will unite the benefits of a large comparative view and the stimulus of local // pride . Here again , as at so many points , the incompetency of local boards is the chief hindrance . Even comparison of the schools of a city like Springfield , Massachusetts , which elects its school board on a ticket at large , with those of other cities of the same class in New England tells the story . The former method secures the services of men known throughout the city ; the latter , of men known in their own wards . The inquiry about promotions brings to view perhaps the greatest diversity of opinion and practice . Adjacent schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent promotion is from sub-mastership to mastership ; less often do promotions occur from grammar to high school grades . The general opinion is that all grades of grammar teachers should have the same pay . Most teachers prefer to work in the grade to which they are accustomed , and many say that nature fits each teacher to some particular grade where she succeeds , but she would fail if advanced . Many a good primary teacher is spoiled if transferred to upper grades . The same democratic spirit that lets a superior teacher go to a large town for a small advance , rather than break the dead level of the pay scale , favors absolute equality as between grades . Often where the method of certification puts teachers whose examinations rank lowest in the low grades , they are content to remain there unless a higher certificate improves materially their tenure or pay . How different this principle from that of the German Professor Rein , who would have teachers begin with the lower primary , and go up through all grades with the same class , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But very few favor the plan of encouraging special teachers to teach the same subjects in all grades . As this is a matter to which I have given some thought , I will express the opinion that the best plan is for class teachers for lower grades to go up two or even four years with the same class ; and for higher grades , that the class teacher 's functions should gradually yield to those of the special teacher . The last question of all , asking for general remarks , has evoked a vast and miscellaneous but very interesting body of suggestions , facts , and criticisms . A Maine man wants a rule forbidding teachers to do outside work for pay . A Boston man says that not one in a hundred of the male teachers in that city is a Boston boy . In Brookline ( Massachusetts ) , Detroit , and elsewhere , education societies , mothers ' clubs , and the like are organized with the distinct aim of bringing parents and teachers together , and excellent results are reported . In Brookline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This gives the afternoon for rest , recreation , and successful teachers ' meetings . A Connecticut principal , who had held his place for thirty years , and failed of redection by the school committee last June , was chosen at a special election by a large majority of the citizens . A Minnesota superintendent urges that child study is a bad influence , as it has become a fad . Many complain of the low social status of the teacher , and in some places it is said to be impossible for teacbers to find board in pleasant families . Another insists that eighth-grade pupils might just as well be two years younger . A West Virginia teacher reports that getting in debt to school officers is a good way of insuring a position on the teachers ' staff , so that the debtor may be in a position to pay . And two teachers hint at dreadful evils they might detail , growing out of personal favor and patronage . As a whole , these returns certainly give a new point of view . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits , but the names of these 1189 teachers and superintendents , many of whom are of the , very highest standing , offer conclusive evidence , even if the spirit of the reports // did not sufficiently evince the fact , that there is almost no attempt at sensationalism , gossip , or expressions of personal disaffection . The evils are very real , grave , and widespread ; whether a trifle more or less so than these rough estimates make out is of small account . They stand out in gloomy contrast with the glorification of the perfections of our system commonly heard in teachers ' meetings , and by many thought necessary to insure a continuation of school appropriations . The two general impressions left on my own mind from a careful reading of the reports , here so inadequately condensed , may be summarized as follows - ( 1 . ) Nowhere has there ever been , to my knowledge , so clear and forceful a presentation of the evils of subjecting schools to political officers who are nearly lowest in the scale of political preferment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state superintendents , but even normal school principals must look to politics for a continuance in office . As long as this lasts appointment can not be wisely made , tenure is not by merit , and the value to the community of every dollar of school money is greatly depreciated . The moral influence of such a system is wholly bad not only upon the community , but on every part of school work and on every person connected with it . It hurts the pupils most of all . The difference between a good and a fairly good teacher , to say nothing of a bad one , is incalculable , but , like all things of the soul , inappreciable to the general public . There are schools in my city , and other cities in my State , where I should prefer two years of schooling for a child of mine to four years in another school where the public makes little or no discrimination . The reforms needed , in my judgment , are , that the power of appointment and also of removal be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected on tickets at large ; that with advancement up the grades should go increase of pay , permanence , and dignity , but that good teachers in all grades should he paid more than poor teachers in any grade ; that there be a great but gradual increase of special teaching as pupils pass up the grades ; that the selection of textbooks be placed in expert and uncorruptible hands ; and finally , that the functions of formal examinations be greatly reduced . ( 2 . ) The question is very often suggested by these returns , whether the many graduates of normal schools are of such value to the public school system as teachers as the advocates of these schools claim . It is time this question were discussed , and nowhere is it more urgent than in Massachusetts , where four new normal schools are liable to give to existing traditions and practices a momentum they little deserve . Most of our American normal schools , not however without a good number of exceptions , have become institutions where form is exalted above substance , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher has and loves knowledge , and has a strong and quick feeling for childhood , a few simple and easily taught rules , devices , and a few dozen lessons each on the history of education and the human soul , are enough for the rank and file . It is so fatally easy to let method glide into the place of matter , to make intricate what God made plain , to make hard and formal what nature reveals at once to tact and to the native insight of childhood by judicious hints , that it is perhaps not strange that normal school work tends , as by an iron and universal law , to degenerate . Here is the source of most of the internal evils ; low politics is responsible for most of those that are external . No part of our entire educational system so needs regeneration as the normal schools . The first step in the reform of these evils would be a commission of the right kind of experts , familiar with systems in other lands , to investigate and report . This should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoints principals and allows courses to be shaped for the four new normal schools . It would be wasting a great opportunity not to inaugurate a new dispensation with these new institutions . I suggest that the governor appoint such a commission without delay , before it is too late . This step would be strongly opposed by most of the existing normal schools , but I believe it would be heartily approved by most other friends of education in the State . If such a commission were rightly selected and its report were adopted , it would mark an epoch in the history of public education in the State . On the whole , many and crying as are these evils , and glaringly as they refute the Dr. Pangloss optimism and spreadeagleism so common in this country where teachers forgather , for one I am not discouraged , but would rather bid teachers hope . If a corresponding inquiry into the best points of our schools and teachers were made , and the results were massed as these have been , the picture would be very bright . Somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , almost every reform in education has been successfully begun . Slowly from these vital points the leaven will pervade the lump . If I were to sum up all our needs into one great need , it would be that of sane and well-trained leaders . As a whole , American teachers are sheep without a shepherd , sadly lacking , but readily - often too readily - accepting intellectual guidance . They are often sorely confused between conflicting authorities ; a little too eager for novelties ; a little too prone to say , Lo here , lo there ; responding heartily to every genuine enthusiasm and interest in their work , but as yet without any settled method , philosophy , or consensus of any kind ; awaiting half unconsciously some clear dispensation of pedagogic art and science . That its star is already above the horizon , and is visible to all who love and know childhood aright , I believe with all my soul .
