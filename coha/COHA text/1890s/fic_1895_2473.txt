The boy John was sitting on the wharf , watching the ebb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been heavy rains within a few days ; the river was full of drifting logs , bits of bark , odds and ends of various kinds ; the water , usually so blue , looked brown and thick . It swirled round the great mossy piers , making eddies between them ; from time to time the boy dropped bits of paper into these eddies , and saw with delight how they spun round and round , like living things , and finally gave up the struggle and were borne away down stream . " Only , in the real maelstrom , " he said , " they do n't be carried away ; they go over the edge , down into the black hole , whole ships and ships , and you never see them again . I wonder where they stop , or whether it goes through to the other side of the world . " A great log came drifting along , and struck against a pier ; the end swung round , and it rested for a few moments , beating against the wooden wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it behooved the boy John , as a hero and a life-saver , to rescue her passengers . Seizing a pole , he lay down on his stomach and carefully drew the log toward him , murmuring words of cheer the while . " They are almost starved to death ! " he said , pitifully . " The captain is tied to the mast , and they have not had anything to eat but boots and a puppy for three weeks . The mate and some of the sailors took all the boats and ran away ,  - -  at least , not ran , but went off and left the rest of ' em ; and they have all said their prayers , for they are very good folks , and the captain did n't want to kill the puppy one bit , but he had to , or else they would all be dead now . And -- and the reckoning was dead ,  - -  I wonder what that means , and why it is dead so often ,  - -  and so they could n't tell where they were , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this was the hungriest time of the year for cannibals . " Here followed a few breathless moments , during which the captain , his wife and child , and the faithful members of the crew , were pulled up to the wharf by the unaided arm of the boy John . He wrapped them in hot blankets and gave them brandy and peanut taffy : the first because it was what they always did in books ; the second because it was the best thing in the world , and would take away the nasty taste of the brandy . Leaving them in safety , and in floods of grateful tears , the rescuer bent over the side of the wharf once more , intent on saving the gallant ship from her fate ; but at this moment came a strong swirl of tide , the log swung round once more and floated off , and the rescuer fell " all along " into the water . This was nothing unusual , and he came puffing and panting up the slippery logs , and sat down again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipwrecked crew had not seen him ; he knew he should get a whipping when he reached home , but that was of less consequence . Anyhow , she was an old vessel , and now the captain would get a new ship -- a fine one , full rigged , with new sails as white as snow ; and on his next voyage he would take him , the boy John , in place of the faithless mate , and they would sail away , away , down the river and far across the ocean , and then ,  - -  then he would hear the sound of the sea . After all , you never could hear it in the river , though that was , oh , so much better than nothing ! But the things that the shells meant when they whispered , the things that the wind said over and over in the pine trees , those things you never could know until you heard the real sound of the real sea . The child rose and stretched himself wearily . He had had a happy time , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he cared more for than for anything in the world , must leave the water and go back to the small close house , and go to bed , and dream no more dreams . Ah ! when would some one come , no play hero , but a real one , in a white-sailed ship , and carry him off , never to set foot on shore again ? He turned to go , for the shadows were falling , and already a fog had crept up the river , almost hiding the brown , swiftly-flowing water ; yet before leaving the wharf he turned back once more and looked up and down , with eyes that strove to pierce the fog veil ,  - -  eager , longing eyes of a child , who hopes every moment to see the doors open into fairy-land . And lo ! what was this that he saw ? What was this that came gliding slowly , silently out of the dusk , out of the whiteness , itself whiter than the river fog , more shadowy than the films of twilight ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fast . A vessel , or the ghost of a vessel ? Nearer and nearer it came , and now he could see masts and spars , sails spread to catch the faint breeze , gleaming brass-work about the decks . A vessel , surely ; yet ,  - -  what was that ? The fog lifted for a moment , or else his eyes grew better used to the dimness , and he saw a strange thing . On the prow of the vessel , which now was seen to be a schooner , stood a figure ; a statue , was it ? Surely it was a statue of bronze , like the Soldiers ' Monument , leaning against the mast , with folded arms . Nearer ! Fear seized the boy , for he thought the statue had eyes like real eyes , and he saw them move , as if looking from right to left ; the whites glistened , the dark balls rolled from side to side . The child stood still , feeling as if he had called up this phantom out of his own thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fog , as it had come , and leave only the flowing tide and the shrouded banks on either side ! Nearer ! and now the bronze figure lifted its arm , slowly , silently , and pointed at the boy . But this was more than flesh and blood could stand ; little John uttered a choking cry , and turning his back on the awful portent , ran home as fast as he could lay foot to ground . And on seeing this the bronze figure laughed , and its teeth glistened , even as the eyes had done . CHAPTER II . THE SKIPPER . The little boy slept brokenly that night . Bronze statues flitted through his dreams , sometimes frowning darkly on him , folding him in an iron clasp , dragging him down into the depths of roaring whirlpools ; sometimes , still stranger to say , smiling , looking on him with kindly eyes , and telling him that the sea was not so far away as he thought , and that one day he should see it and know the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed no possible doubt of that ; it tossed up and down as it lay by the wharf ; and once the lines were cast off , and he was about to be carried away , when up rose the crew that he had rescued from shipwreck , and cried with one voice , " No ! no ! he shall not go ! " The voice was that of Mr. Endymion Scraper , and not a pleasant voice to hear ; moreover , the voice had hands , lean and hard , which clutched the boy 's shoulder , and shook him roughly ; and at last , briefly , it appeared that it was time to get up , and that if the boy John did not get up that minute , like the lazy good-for-nothing he was , Mr. Scraper would give him such a lesson as he would not forget for one while . John tumbled out of bed , and stood rubbing his eyes for a moment , his wits still abroad . The water heaved and subsided under him , but presently it hardened into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the hard hand gave him a push and let him go , then stood firm and looked about him . Gradually the room grew familiar ; the painted bed and chair , the window with its four small panes , which he loved to polish and clean , " so that the sky could come through , " the purple mussel-shell and the china dog , his sole treasures and ornaments . The mussel was his greatest joy , perhaps ; it had been given him by a fisherman , who had brought a pocket-full back from his sea trip , to please his own children . It made no sound , but the tint was pure and lovely , and it was lined with rainbow pearl . The dog was not jealous , for he knew ( or the boy John thought he knew ) , that he was , after all , the more companionable of the two , and that he was talked to ten times for the mussel 's once . John was telling him now , as he struggled into his shirt and trousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed it . " And as soon as ever I have my chores done , " he said , and his eyes shone , and his cheek flushed at the thought , " as soon as ever , I 'm going down there , just to see . Of course , I suppose it is n't there , you know ; but then , if it should be ! " The dog expressed sympathy in his usual quiet way , and was of the opinion that John should go by all means , for , after all , who could say that the vision might not have been reality ? When one considered the stories one had read ! and had not the dog just heard the whole of " Robinson Crusoe " read aloud , bit by bit , in stealthy whispers , by early daylight , by moonlight , by stray bits of candle begged from a neighbor , had he not heard and appreciated every word of the immortal story ? He was no ignorant dog , indeed ! His advice was worth having . Breakfast was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast in Mr. Scraper 's house . The chores were a more serious matter , for every spoon and plate had to be washed to the tune of a lashing tongue , and under an eye that withered all it lighted on . But at last ,  - -  at last the happy hour came when the tyrant 's back was turned , and the tyrant 's feet tottered off in the direction of the post-office . The daily purchases , the daily gossip at the " store , " would fill the rest of the morning , as John well knew . He listened in silence to the charges to " keep stiddy to work , and git that p'tater-patch wed by noon ; " he watched the departure of his tormentor , and went straight to the potato-patch , duty and fear leading him by either hand . The weeds had no safety of their lives that day ; he was in too great a hurry to dally , as he loved to do , over the bigger stalks of pigweed , the giants which he , with his trusty sword -- only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behead , and tear in pieces . Even the sprawling pusley-stems , which generally played the part of devil-fish and tarantulas and various other monsters , suffered no amputation of limb by limb , but were torn up with merciful haste , and flung in heaps together . Was the potato-patch thoroughly " wed ? " I hardly know . But I know that in less than an hour after Mr. Endymion Scraper started for the village the boy John was on his way to the wharf . As he drew near the river he found that something was the matter with his breath . It would not come regularly , but in gasps and sighs ; his heart beat so hard , and was so high up in his throat he was almost choked . Would he see anything when he turned the corner that led down to the wharf ? And if anything ,  - -  what ? Then he shut his eyes and turned the corner . The schooner was there . No longer spectral or shadowy , she lay in plain sight by the wharf , her trim lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her canvas all spread out to dry , for the night dew had been heavy . Lifting his fearful eyes , the child saw the bronze figure standing in the bow , but now it was plainly seen to be a man , a swarthy man , with close-curled black hair , and bright , dark eyes . Two other men were lounging about the deck , but John took little heed of them . This man , the strangest he had ever seen , claimed his whole thought . He was as dark as the people in the geography book , where the pictures of the different races were ; not an Ethiopian , evidently ( John loved the long words in the geography book ) , because his nose was straight and his lips thin ; perhaps a Malay or an Arab . If one could see a real Arab , one could ask him about the horses , and whether the dates were always sticky , and what he did in a sandstorm , and lots of interesting things . And then a Malay ,  - -  why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amuck ,  - -  only , perhaps , that would not be polite . These meditations were interrupted by a hail from the schooner . It was the dark man himself who spoke , in a quiet voice that sounded kind . " Good-morning , sir ! Will you come aboard this morning ? " John was not used to being called " Sir , " and the word fell pleasantly on ears that shrank from the detested syllable " Bub , " with which strangers were wont to greet him . " Yes , if you please , " he answered , with some dignity . It is , perhaps , difficult to be stately when one is only five feet tall , but John felt stately inside , as well as shy . The stranger turned and made a sign to the other men , who came quickly , bringing a gang-plank , which they ran out from the schooner 's deck to the wharf . The Skipper , for such the dark man appeared to be , made a sign of invitation , and after a moment 's hesitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white schooner . Was he still dreaming ? Would he wake in a moment and find himself back in the garret at home , with Mr. Scraper shaking him ? " Welcome , young gentleman ! " said the Skipper , holding out his hand . " Welcome ! the first visitor to the schooner . That it is a child , brings luck for the next voyage , so we owe you a thank . We arrived last night only . And what is my young gentleman 's name ? " " My name is John , " said the boy , standing with down-cast eyes before this wonderful person . " And mine ! " said the Skipper ,  --  " two Johns , the black and the red . You should be called Juan Colorado , for your hair of red gold . " The boy looked up quickly , his cheek flushing ; he did not like to be laughed at ; but the Skipper 's face was perfectly grave , and only courtesy and hospitality shone from his dark eyes . " I wonder what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking low , and addressing his remarks apparently to the mast , which he kicked gently with his foot . " The schooner is the ' Nautilus , ' young gentleman ! " The reply came from the Skipper , not from the mast , yet it was still to the latter that the boy made his next observation . " I wonder where she comes from , and where she is going , and what she is going to do here ! " And having delivered himself breathlessly of these remarks , the boy John wished he could squeeze through a port-hole , or melt away into foam , or get away somehow , anyhow . But now he felt himself lifted in strong arms , and set on the rail of the vessel , with his eyes just opposite those of the Skipper , so that he could not look up without meeting them ; and on so looking up , it became evident immediately that this was the kindest man in the world , and that he liked boys , and that , finally , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty sigh of relief , and then smiled , and then laughed . " I like to know things ! " he said , simply . " Me , too , " replied the Skipper . " I also like to know things . How else shall we become wise , Juan Colorado ? Now listen , and you shall hear . This schooner is the ' Nautilus , ' as I say , and she is a Spanish schooner . Yes ; " ( in reply to the question in the boy 's eyes , ) " I am partly a Spanish man , but not all . I have other mankind in me , young gentleman . We come from the Bahamas . Do you know where are they , the Bahamas ? " John nodded . He liked geography , and stood at the head of his class . " Part of the West Indies , " he said , rapidly . " Low , coral islands . One of them , San Salvador , is said to be the first land discovered by Columbus in 1492 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco , and tropical fruits . Belong to Great Britain . That 's all I know . " " Caramba ! " said a handsome youth , who was lounging on the rail a few feet off , gazing on with idle eyes , " you got the schoolmaster here , Patron ! I did not know all that , me , and I come , too , from Bahamas . Say , you teach a school , M'sieur ? " " Franci ! " said the Patron , gravely . " Si , Senor ! " said Franci , with a beautiful smile , which showed his teeth under his black mustache . " There is a school of flying-fish in the cabin . Better see to them ! " " Si , Senor ! " said Franci , and disappeared down the hatchway . " Is there ? " asked the boy John , with great eyes of wonder . The Skipper smiled , and shook his head . " Franci understands me , " he said . " I wish to tell him that he go about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaf about the deck . I take a little way round about , but he understands very well , Franci . And of all these exports , what does the young gentleman think I have brought from the Bahamas ? " " I -- I was just wondering ! " John confessed ; but he did not add his secret hope that it was something more interesting than cotton or tobacco . The Skipper turned and made a quick , graceful gesture with his hand . " Perhaps the young gentleman like to see my cargo , " he said . " Do me the favor ! " and he led the way down to the cabin . Now it became evident to the boy that all had indeed been a dream . It sometimes happened that way , dreaming that you woke and found it all true , and then starting up to find that the first waking had been of dream-stuff too , that it was melting away from your sight , from your grasp ; even things that looked so real , so real ,  - -  he pinched himself violently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fetters of sleep , binding him to such sweet wonders , that he must lose next moment ; but no waking came , and the wonders remained . The cabin was full of shells . Across one end of the little room ran a glazed counter , where lay heaped together various objects of jewelry , shell necklaces , alligator teeth and sea-beans set in various ways , tortoise-shell combs , bracelets and hairpins ,  - -  a dazzling array . Yet the boy 's eyes passed almost carelessly over these treasures , to light with quick enchantment on the shells themselves , the real shells , as he instantly named them to himself , resenting half-consciously the turning of Nature 's wonders into objects of vulgar adornment . The shells were here , the shells were there , the shells were all around ! Shelf above shelf of them , piled in heaps , lying in solitary splendor , arranged in patterns ,  - -  John had never , in his wildest dreams , seen so many shells . Half the poetry of his little life had been in the lovely forms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scraper 's parlor ; for Mr. Scraper was a collector of shells in a small way . John had supposed his collection to be , if not the only one in the world , at least the most magnificent , by long odds ; yet here were the old man 's precious units multiplied into tens , into twenties , sometimes into hundreds , and all lying open to the day , as if anyone , even a small one , even a little boy , who almost never had anything in his hand more precious than his own purple mussel at home , might touch and handle them and feel himself in heaven . They gleamed with the banded glories of the rainbow : they softened into the moonlight beauty of the pearl ; they veiled their loveliness in milky clouds , through which the color showed as pure and sweet as the cheek of a bride ; they glowed with depths of red and flame that might almost burn to the touch . The little boy stood with clasped hands , and sobbed with excitement . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wonder that was not without reproach . " Are there none left any more , at all ? " The Skipper laughed quietly . " The mermaids see not any difference , sir , " he said . " Where I take one shell from its rock , I leave a hundred , a thousand . The sea is a good mother , she has plenty children . See ! " he added , lifting a splendid horned shell , " this is the Royal Triton . On a rock I found him , twenty fathom down . It was a family party , I think , for all around they lay , some clinging to the rock , some in the mud , some walking about . I take one , two , three , put them in my pouch ; up I go , and the others , they have a little more room , that 's all . " John 's eyes glowed in his head . " I -- I should like to see that ! " he cried . " What is it like down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tails ? And why do n't they eat you , like the man in the geography book ? And is there really a sea-serpent ? And do the oysters open and shut their mouths , so that you can see the pearls , or how do you know which are the right ones ? " There are a great many things that I have thought about all my life , " he said , " and nobody could ever tell me . The bottom of the sea , that is what I want most in the world to know about . " He paused , out of breath , and would have been abashed at his own boldness , had not the Skipper 's eyes told him so perfectly that they had understood all about it , and that there was no sort of reason why he should not ask all the questions he liked . They were wonderful eyes , those of the Skipper . Most black eyes are wanting in the depths that one sounds in blue , or gray , in brown , more rarely in hazel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soften into velvet , but one seldom sees through them into the heart . But these eyes , though black beyond a doubt , had the darkness of deep , still water , when you look into it and see the surface mantling with a bluish gloss , and beneath that depth upon depth of black -- clear , serene , unfathomable . And when a smile came into them , ah , well ! we all know how that same dark water looks when the sun strikes on it . The sun struck now , and little John felt warm and comfortable all through his body and heart . " The bottom of the sea ? " said the Skipper , taking up a shell and polishing it on his coat-sleeve . " Yes , that is a fine place , Colorado . You mind not that I call you Colorado ? It pleases me ,  - -  the name . A fine place , truly . You have never seen the sea , young gentleman ? " The boy shook his head . " Never , really ! " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think about it most of the time . There 's a picture in my geography book , just a piece of sea , and then broken off , so that you do n't see any end to it ; that makes it seem real , somehow , I do n't know why . " But I 've heard the sound of it ! " he added , his face brightening . " There 's a shell in Mr. Scraper 's parlour , on the mantelpiece , and sometimes when he goes to sleep I can get it for a minute , and hold it to my ear , and then I hear the sound , the sound of the sea . " " Yes , " said the Skipper , taking up another shell from one of the shelves , a tiger cowry , rich with purple and brown . " The sound of the sea ; that is a good thing . Listen here , young gentleman , and tell me what the tiger say to you of the sea . " He held the shell to the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come like a wave into his face . They were silent for a moment ; then the child spoke , low and dreamily . " It does n't say words , you know ! " he said . " It 's just a soft noise , like what the pine-trees make , but it sounds cool and green and -- and wet . And there are waves a long way off , curling over and over , and breaking on white beaches , and they smell good and salt . And it seems to make me know about things down under the sea , and bright colours shining through the water , and light coming ' way down -- cool , green light , that does n't make you wink when you look at it . And -- and I guess there are lots of fishes swimming about , and their eyes shine , too , and they move just as soft , and do n't make any noise , no more than if their mother was sick in the next room . And on the ground there seem to be like flowers , only they move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And -- and --  " Was the boy going into a trance ? Were the dark eyes mesmerizing him , or was all this to be heard in the shell ? The Skipper took the shell gently from his hand , and stroked his hair once or twice , quickly and lightly . " That will do ! " he said . " The young gentleman can hear truly . All these things are under the sea , yes , and more , oh , many more ! Some day you shall see them , young gentleman ; who knows ? But now comes Franci to make the dinner . Will Senor Colorado dine with the Skipper from the Bahamas ? Welcome he will be , truly . " Little John started , and a guilty flush swept over his clear face . " I forgot ! " he cried . " I forgot all about everything , and Cousin Scraper will be home by this time , and -- and -- I 'll have to be going , please ; but I 'll come again , if you think I may . " The Skipper had raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now looking curiously at the boy . " Who is that you say ? " he asked . " Scraper , your cousin ? And of your father , young gentleman ,  - -  why do you not speak of him ? " " My father is dead , " replied little John . " And my mother too , a good while ago . I do n't remember father . Mother --  --  " he broke off , and dropped his eyes to hide the tears that sprang to them . " Mother died a year ago , " he said ; " ever since then I 've lived with Cousin Scraper . He 's some sort of kin to father , and he says he 's my guardian by law . " " His other name ? " suggested the dark man , quietly . " For example , Endymion ? " " Why , yes ! " cried John , raising his honest blue eyes in wonder . " Do you know him , sir ? Have you ever been here before ? " The Skipper shook his head . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a guess at the name ; perhaps of this gentleman I have heard . He -- he is a kind person , Colorado ? " John hung his head . He knew that he must not speak evil ; his mother had always told him that ; yet what else was there to speak about Cousin Scraper ? " He -- he collects shells ! " he faltered , after a pause , during which he was conscious of the Skipper 's eyes piercing through and through him , and probably seeing the very holes in his stockings . But now the Skipper threw back his head with a laugh . " He collects shells , eh ? My faith , I have come to the right place , I with my ' Nautilus . ' See , young gentleman ! I go with my shells where I think is good market . In large cities , many rich people who collect shells . I sell many , many , some very precious . Never have I come up this river of great beauty ; but I say , who knows ? Maybe here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shells in their hearts . I find , first you , Colorado ; and that you have the feeling in your heart I see , at the first look you give to my pretties here . That you have the fortune to live with a collector , that I could not guess , ha ? He is kind , I say , this Scraper ? He loves you as a son , he gives you his shells to look at , to care for as your own ? " John hung his head again . " He keeps them locked up , " he admitted . " I never had one in my hand , except the one on the mantelpiece , sometimes when he goes to sleep after dinner . I -- I must be going now ! " he cried in desperation , making his way to the gang-plank . " I must get home , or he'll --  " " What he will do ? " the Skipper inquired , holding the plank in his hand . " What he do to you , young gentleman , eh ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with the Skipper from the Bahamas , hey ? No more than that , is it not ? " " He 'll beat me , " cried little John , driven fairly past himself . " He beats me every time I 'm late , or do n't get my work done . I thank you ever so much for being so kind , but I ca n't stay another minute . " " Adios , then , Senor Colorado ! " said the Skipper , with a stately bow . " You come soon again , I pray you . And if you will tell Sir Scraper , and all those others , your friends , the shell schooner is here . Exhibition in a few hours ready , free to all . Explanation and instruction when desired by intelligent persons desiring of to know the habits under the sea . Schooner ' Nautilus , ' from the Bahamas , with remarkable collection of shells and marine curiosities . Adios , Senor Juan Colorado ! " CHAPTER III . A GREAT EXHIBITION . Little John was not the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to take his whipping ,  - -  a hard one it was !  - -  and then he was sent down into the cellar to sift ashes , as the most unpleasant thing that could be devised for a fine afternoon . But the news spread , for all that . John was not the only boy in the village of Tidewater , and by twelve o'clock every man , woman and child was talking about the new arrival ; and by two o'clock , the dinner dishes being put away , and the time of the evening chores still some hours off , nearly every man , woman and child was hastening in the direction of the wharf . Of course the boys were going . It was vacation time , and what else should boys do but see all that was to be seen ? And of course it was the duty of the elders to see that the children came to no harm . So the fathers were strolling leisurely down , saying to each other that ' t was all nonsense , most likely , and nothing worth seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys and the women folks did n't get cheated . The mothers were putting on their bonnets , in the serene consciousness that if anyone was going to be cheated it was not they , and that goodness knew what those men-folks would be up to on that schooner if they were left to themselves . And the little girls were shaking the pennies out of their money boxes , or if they had no boxes , watching with eager eyes their more fortunate sisters . Truly , it was a great day in the village . The Skipper welcomed one and all . He stood by the gang-plank , and Franci stood by him , cap in hand , smiling in a beautiful way . On the rail were perched two little monkeys , their arms round each other 's shoulders , their bright eyes watching with eager curiosity all that went on . When the Skipper bowed , they bowed ; when he smiled , they grinned ; and when he put out his hand to help a woman or a child aboard , they laid their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Skipper was their lord and master , and they loved and feared him , and did his bidding as often as their nature would allow ; but in the depths of their little monkey hearts they cherished a profound admiration for Franci , and they were always hoping that this time they were looking like him when they smiled . ( But they never were ! ) The only other visible member of the crew was a long , lazy-looking Yankee , whom the Skipper called Rento , and the others plain " Rent , " his full name of Laurentus Woodcock being more than they could away with . But it was not to see the crew , neither the schooner ( though she was a pretty schooner enough , as anybody who knew about such matters could see ) , that the village had come out ; it was to see the exhibition , and the exhibition was ready for them . An awning was spread over the after-deck , and under this was arranged with care the main collection of corals and shells , the commoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . There was pure white coral , in long branches , studded with tiny points , like the wraith of the fairy thorn ; there were great piles of the delicate fan-coral , which the sailors call sea-fans , and which Franci would hold out to every girl who had any pretence to good looks , with his most gracious bow , and " Young lady like to fan herself , keep the sun off , here you air , ladies ! " While Laurentus would blush and hang his head if any woman addressed him , and would murmur the wrong price in an unintelligible voice if the woman happened to be young and pretty . Then there were mushroom corals , so inviting that one could hardly refrain from carrying them home and cooking them for tea ; and pincushion corals , round and hard , looking as if they had been stolen from the best bedroom of some uncompromising New England mermaid . Yes ; there was no end to the corals . The lovely white branches were cheap , and nearly every child went off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes of rapture , seeing nothing else in the world , in some cases failing to see even the way , and being rescued from peril of water by the Skipper or Rento . The favourite shells were the conches , of all sizes and varieties , from the huge pink-lipped Tritons of the " Triumph of Galatea , " down to fairy things , many-whorled , rainbow-tinted , which were included in the " handful for five cents " which Franci joyously proclaimed at intervals , when he thought the children looked wistful and needed cheering up , since they could not have all they saw . But the Cypraeas were beautiful , too , and of every colour , from white or palest amber to deep sullen purples and browns that melted into ebony . These were the shells with voices , that spoke of the sea ; many a child raised them to his ear , and listened with vague delight to the far-away , uncertain murmur ; but not to every child is it given to hear the sound of the sea , and it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the boy John meant , if he had declared the things that the shell had said to him . Where was John ? Franci and Rento had charge of the deck exhibition , but the Skipper kept his station at the head of the gang-plank , and while courteously receiving his visitors , with a word of welcome for each , he looked often up the road to see if his little friend was coming . He thought the gleam of red hair would brighten the landscape ; but it came not , and the Skipper was not one to neglect a possible customer . Now and again he would touch some one on the arm , and murmur gently , " In a few moments presently , other exhibition in the cabin , to which I have the pleasure of invite you . I attend in person , which is free to visitors . " He spoke without accent , the Skipper , but his sentences were sometimes framed on foreign models , and it was no wonder if now and then he met a blank stare . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of idle wonder , showed no trace of the collector 's eager gaze ; yet he was content to wait , it appeared . Mr. Bill Hen Pike judged , from the way in which everything was trigged up , that the schooner " cal'lated to make some stay hereabouts ; " and the Skipper did not contradict him , but bowed gravely , and said , " In a few moments , gentleman , do me the honour to descend to the cabin , where I take the pleasure of exhibit remarkable collection of shells . " But now the Skipper raised his head , and became in a moment keenly alert ; for a new figure was seen making its slow way to the wharf ,  - -  a new figure , and a singular one . An old man , white-haired and wizen , with a face like a knife-blade , and red , blinking eyes . The face wore a look of eager yet doleful anticipation , as of a man going to execution and possessed with an intense desire to feel the edge of the axe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips moved , and he shook his head from time to time . This old gentleman was clad in nankeen trousers of ancient cut , a velvet waistcoat and a blue swallow-tail coat , all greatly too large for him . His scant locks were crowned by a cheap straw hat of the newest make , his shoes and gaiters were of a twenty-year-old pattern . Altogether , he was not an ordinary-looking old gentleman , nor was his appearance agreeable ; but the village people took no special notice of him , being well used to Mr. Endymion Scraper and his little ways . They knew that he was wearing out the clothes that his extravagant uncle had left behind him at his death , twenty years ago . They had seen three velvet waistcoats worn out , and one of brocade ; there were sixteen left , as any woman in the village could tell you . As for the nankeen trousers , some people said there were ten dozen of them in the great oak chest , but that might be an exaggeration . Walking just behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go sedately , and not betray by hopping and skippings the joy that was in them , came the boy John ; brought along in case there should be a parcel to carry . Mr. Scraper had brought , too , his supple bamboo cane , in case of need ; it was a cane of singular parts , and had a way that was all its own of curling about the legs and coming up " rap " against the tender part of the calf . The boy John was intimately acquainted with the cane ; therefore , when his legs refused to go steadily , but danced in spite of him , he had dropped behind Mr. Endymion , and kept well out of reach of the searching snake of polished cane . The Skipper greeted the new-comer with his loftiest courtesy , which was quite thrown away on the old gentleman . " Hey ! hey ! " said Mr. Scraper , nodding his head , and fumbling in his waistcoat pocket , " got some shells , I hear ! Got some shells , eh ? Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seen ' em all before you were born ; not worth looking at , I 'll bet a pumpkin . " " Why , Deacon Scraper , how you do talk ! " exclaimed pretty Lena Brown , who was standing near by . " The shells are just elegant , I think ; too handsome for anything . " " All rubbish ! all rubbish ! " the old gentleman repeated , hastily . " Children 's nonsense , every bit of it . Have you got anything out of the common , though ? have you , hey ? " He looked up suddenly at the Skipper , screwing his little eyes at him like animated corkscrews ; but he read nothing in the large , calm gaze that met his . " The gentleman please to step down in the cabin , " the Skipper said , with a stately gesture . " At liberty in a moment , I shall take the pleasure to exhibit my collection . The gentleman is a collector ? " he added , quietly ; but this Mr. Scraper would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried , testily , " nothing of the sort ! Just came down here with this fool boy , to keep him from falling into the water . Do n't know one shell from another when I see ' em . " This astounding statement brought a low cry from John , who had been standing on one foot with joy and on the other with fear , the grave dignity of his new friend filling him with awe . Perhaps he would not be noticed now , when all the grown people were here ; perhaps -- but his thoughts were put to flight by Mr. Scraper 's words . John was a truthful boy , and he could not have the Spanish man think he had lied in saying that the old man was a collector . He was stepping forward , his face alight with eager protest , when Mr. Endymion Scraper brought his cane round with a backward sweep , catching John on the legs with spiteful emphasis . The Skipper saw it , and a dark red flushed through the bronze of his cheek . His glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheer , and the promise of better things ; the boy dropped back and rubbed his smarting shins , well content , with a warm feeling about the heart . " The gentleman will step down to the cabin , " said the deep , quiet voice . " I will attend him , the ladies also . " He led the way , and pretty Lena Brown came next ; she glanced up at him as he held out his strong hand to help her down the ladder . Her blue eyes were very sweet as she met his gaze , and the faint wild-rose blush became her well . Certainly , Lena was a very pretty girl . Franci nearly tumbled over the companion-rail in his endeavours to look after her , and Laurentus Woodcock , catching one glimpse of her face , retreated to the farthest corner of the after-deck , and sold a Triton for ten cents , when the lowest price was thirty . Several other persons came down into the cabin at the same time . There was Mr. Bill Hen Pike . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was a point of honour with him to visit anything with keel and sails that came up the river . He used nautical expressions whenever it could be managed , and was the village authority on all sea-going matters . There were Isaac Cutter and his wife , who had money to spend , and were not averse to showing it ; there was Miss Eliza Clinch , who had spent her fifty years of life in looking for a bargain , which she had not yet found ; and some others . But though the Skipper was courteous to all , he kept close to the side of Mr. Endymion Scraper ; and the boy John , and Lena Brown , who was always kind to him , kept close beside the other two . The girl was enchanted with what she saw , but her joy was chiefly in the trinkets that filled the glass counter ,  - -  the necklaces and bracelets , the shell hairpins and mother-of-pearl portemonnaies . " Ai nt they handsome ? " she cried , over and over , surveying the treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny ! is n't that just elegant ? Did you ever see such beautiful things ? I do n't think the President 's wife has no handsomer than them ! " John frowned a little at these ecstasies , and glanced at the Skipper ; but the Skipper was apparently absorbed in polishing the Royal Tritons , and showing them to Mr , Scraper , who regarded them with disdainful eyes , while his fingers twitched to lay hold of them . " Why , Lena , you do n't want to be looking at those things ! " the boy urged . " See ! here are the shells ! Here are the real ones , not made up into truck , but just themselves . Oh , oh ! Lena , look ! " The Skipper was coming forward with a shell in his hand of exquisite colour and shape . " Perhaps the young lady like to see this ? " he said . " This the Voluta Musica ,  - -  a valuable shell , young lady . You look , and see the lines of the staff on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! The mermaids under the water , they have among themselves no sheet-music , so on shells they must read it . Can the young lady follow the notes if she take the shell in her hand ? " He laid the lovely thing in the girl 's hand , and marked how the polished lip and the soft pink palm wore the same tender shade of rose ; but he said nothing of this , for he was not Franci . Lena examined the shell curiously . " It does look like music ! " she said . " But there ai n't really any notes , are there ? Not like our notes , I mean . If there was , I should admire to see how they sounded on the reed organ . It would make a pretty pin , if ' t was n't so big ! " She was about to hand the shell back quietly -- she looked like a rose-leaf in moonlight , this pretty Lena , but she was practical , and had little imagination -- but John caught it from her with a swift yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , his pleading eyes on the Skipper 's face . " I want to hear what it says ! " The dark man nodded and smiled ; but a moment later , seeing the lean fingers of Mr. Endymion Scraper about to clutch the treasure , he took it quietly in his own hand again , and turned to the old man . " Gentleman spoke to me ? " he inquired , blandly . The gentleman had not spoken , but had made a series of gasps and grunts , expressive of extreme impatience and eagerness . " That 's a poor specimen , " he cried now , eying the shell greedily , " a very poor specimen ! What do you expect to get for it , hey ? " " A perfect specimen ! " replied the Skipper , calmly . " The gentleman has but to look at it closer "  - -  and he held it nearer to the greedy corkscrew eyes --  " to see that it is a rare specimen , more perfect than often seen in museums . I brought up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is five dollars . " Mr. Endymion Scraper gave a scream , which he tried to turn into a disdainful chuckle . " Five cents would be nearer it ! " he cried , angrily . " Think we 're all fools down here , hey ? Go ' long with your five dollars . " " No , Senor , not all fools ! " said the Skipper . " Many varieties among men , as among shells . I am in no haste to sell the Voluta Musica . It has its price , as gentleman knows by his catalogue . Here is a razor-shell ; perhaps the gentleman like that . Shave yourself or other people with this ! " " I want to know ! " interposed Mrs. Isaac Cutter , leaning forward eagerly , spectacles on nose . " Can folks really shave with those , sir ? They do look sharp , now , do n't they ? What might you ask for a pair ? " " Perhaps not very easy to grind , lady ! " replied the Skipper , with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare shell , only fifty cents the pair . Thank you , madam ! To show you this ? With gladness ! This is the Bleeding Tooth shell , found in plenty in West Indies . They have also dentists under the sea , graciously observe . See here ,  - -  the whole family ! The baby , he have as yet no tooth , the little gum smooth and white . Here , the boy ! ( Como ti , Juan Colorado ! " this in a swift aside , caught only by John 's ear . ) " The boy , he have a tooth pulled , you observe , madam ; here the empty space , with blood-mark , thus . Hence the name , Bleeding Tooth . Here the father , getting old , has lost two teeth , bleeding much ; and this being the old grandfather , all teeth are gone , again . Yes , curious family ! You kindly accept these persons , madam , with a wish that you never suffer of this manner . " Mrs. Isaac Cutter drew a long breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe . " Well , I 'm sure ! " she said , " you 're more than kind , sir . I never thought -- I do declare -- Bleeding Tooth ! Well , father , if that is n't something to tell the folks at home ! " Mr. Isaac Cutter grunted , well pleased , and said , " That so ! " several times , his vocabulary being limited . " Again , here , " the Skipper continued , with a glance around , to make sure that his audience was attentive , " again , here a curious thing , ladies and gentlemen . The Nighthawk shell , not common in any part of the world . The two halves held together of this manner , behold the nighthawk , as he flies through the air ! " A murmur of delight ran through the little group , and Mr. Endymion Scraper edged to the front , his fingers twitching convulsively . " How much -- how much do you want for that Nighthawk ? " he asked , stammering with eagerness . " ' Taint wuth much , but -- what -- ten dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent more . " But the Skipper put him aside with a wave of his hand . " Another time , sir , " he said ; " at future interview I will make arrangements with you , and hope to satisfy ; at present I instruct these ladies a little in life under the sea . " Lady , " he said , and it was observable that although he spoke to Mrs. Isaac Cutter , his eyes rested on Lena , and on the boy John , who stood behind her , " Nature of her abundance is very generous to the sea . Here all fishes swim , great and small ; but more ! All things that on earth find their place , of them you find a picture , copy , what you please to call it , at the bottom of the sea . A few only are yet found by men , yet strange things also have I seen . Not under the ocean do you think to find violets growing , is it so ? yet here you observe a handful of violets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without perfume , the sunshine wanting in those places . " He drew from a box some of the exquisite little violet snail-shells , and gave them to Lena , who cried out with delight , and instantly resolved to have a pair of ear-rings made of them . " The ladies are hungry ? " the quiet voice went on . " They desire breakfast ? I offer them a poached egg , grown under the sea . The colour and shape perfect ; the water ladies eat them every morning , but with the air they grow hard and lose their flavour . Thank you , madam ! for thirty cents only , the poached egg , not a rare variety . Your smile perhaps will make it soft again . I hope you enjoy it at luncheon . " But before luncheon you desire to prepare your charming toilet ? Here I offer you a comb , ladies , as they use under the sea . The story , that Venus , goddess of beauty , when she rose from the ocean , dropped from her hand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold : hence the name , Venus 's Comb . Observe the long teeth , necessary for fine hair , like that of Venus and these ladies . " Mrs. Isaac Cutter bridled , smoothed her " fluffy Fedora " ( price one dollar and fifty cents , ready curled ) , and bought the " comb " on the spot . " Of little boys under the sea , " the Skipper continued ,  - -  and once more his smile fell on the boy John , and produced that agreeable sensation of warmth about the heart to which the little fellow had been long unaccustomed ,  --  " there are many . They swim about , they play , they sport , they go to school , as little boys here . They ride , some persons have told me , on the horse-mackerel , but of that I have no knowledge . I see for myself , however , that they play tops , the small sea-boys . Here , little gentleman , is the Imperial Top ,  - -  very beautiful shell . You like to take it in your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost himself and the world in a dream of rapture , in which he descended to the depths that his soul desired , and played at spinning tops with the sea-boys , and rode a horse-mackerel , and did many other wonderful things . " The bat shell ! " the Skipper went on , lifting one treasure and then another . " The Voluta Aulica , extremely rare ,  - -  the Mitres , worn by bishops under the sea . The bishops must be chosen very small , lady , to fit the shell , since shells were made first . The Queen Conch ! This again ,  - -  pardon me , gentleman , you desire to assist me ? Too kind , but I shall not give that trouble to a visitor ! " The last remark was addressed to Mr. Endymion Scraper , who had for the last five minutes been sidling quietly , and as he thought unobserved , toward the shelf on which lay the Voluta Musica . His claw-like fingers , after hovering over the prize , had finally closed upon it , and he was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a strong brown hand descended upon his wrist . The shell was quietly taken from him , and looking up in impotent rage , he met the dark eyes of the Skipper gazing at him with cheerful gravity . " Price five dollars ! " he murmured , courteously . " In a box , gentleman ? But , certainly ! A valuable specimen . Thank you kindly . Five-dollar bill , quite right ! Exhibition is over for this morning , ladies and gentlemen , to resume in afternoon hours , if graciously pleased to honour the shell schooner ,  - -  schooner ' Nautilus , ' from the Bahamas , with remarkable collection of marine curiosities . " CHAPTER IV . ABOARD THE " NAUTILUS . " The shell schooner had many visitors during the next few days , as she lay by the wharf ; visitors , of whom a few came to buy , but by far the greater part to look and gossip , and see the monkeys , and ask questions . The monkeys , Jack and Jim , were no small part of the attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly of heart , always ready to turn a somersault , or to run up the mast , or to make a bow to the ladies ( always with Franci in their hearts ) , as the Skipper directed them . Of course John was there at every available minute , whenever he could escape the searching of his guardian 's eye and tongue ; but Mr. Scraper himself came several times to the " Nautilus ; " so did pretty Lena Brown . There was no doubt that Lena was a charming girl . She looked like moonlight , Rento thought ; John thought so , too , though he knew that the resemblance went no further than looks . Her hair was soft and light , with a silvery glint when the sun struck it , and it had a pretty trick of falling down about her forehead in two Madonna-like bands , framing the soft , rose-tinted cheeks sweetly enough , and hiding with the pale shining tresses the narrowness of the white forehead . Lena was apt to come with John , to whom she was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a little desultory hovering about the shells , for which she did not really care , except when they were made up with glass beads , she was apt to sit down on the after-deck , with John beside her ( unless the Skipper appeared , in which case the boy flew to join his new friend ) , and with Franci , or Rento , or both , sure to be near by . The monkeys never failed to come and nestle down beside the boy , and examine his pockets and chatter confidentially in his ear ; and John always nodded and seemed to understand , which Lena considered foolishness . She thought she came out of pure kindness for the boy , because " that old gimlet never would let him come alone , and the child was fairly possessed about the shells ; " but it is to be doubted whether she would have come so often if it had not been for Franci 's admiring glances and Rento 's deeper veneration , which seldom dared to look higher than the hem of her gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently absorbed in the shells and corals that lay spread before her ; and by-and-by , it might be , Franci , who did not suffer from shyness , would venture on something more definite than admiring glances . He would show her the shells , making the most of his knowledge , which was not extensive , and calling in invention when information failed ; but he liked better to talk of himself , Franci , and on that subject there was plenty to be said . He was a prince , he told Lena , in South America , where he came from . This was a poor country , miserable country ; but in his own the houses were all of marble , pink marble , with mahogany door-steps . " Is that so ? " Lena would say , raising her limpid eyes to the dark velvety ones that were bent so softly on her . " Oh , fine ! fine ! " said Franci . " Never I eat from a china dish in my country ; silver , all silver ! Only the pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-cream all days , all time . My sister wear gold clothes , trimmed diamonds , when she do her washing . Yes ! Like to go there ? " and he bent over Lena with an enchanting smile . " Why do you tell such lies ? " asked John , whom Franci had not observed , as he was lying in one of the schooner 's boats , with a monkey on either arm . Franci 's smile deepened as he turned toward the boy , swearing softly in Spanish , and feeling in his breast ; but at that moment Rento happened to stroll that way , blushing deeply at Lena 's nearness , yet with a warlike expression in his bright blue eyes . Franci told him he was the son of a pig that had died of the plague , and that he , Franci , devoutly hoped the son would share the fate of his mother , without time to consult a priest . Rento replied that he could jaw as much as he was a mind to , so long as he let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other with a flush on her pretty cheek , and an instinct that made her heart beat a little faster . Mr. Scraper 's visits were apt to be made in the evening ; his passion for shells was like that for drink , and he would fain have hidden it from the eyes of his neighbours . It was always a trial to Franci to know that the old miser , as he called Mr. Endymion , was in the cabin , and that he , Franci , must keep watch on deck while this withered anatomy sat on the cabin chairs and drank with the Patron . Franci 's way of keeping watch was to lie at full length on the deck with his feet in the air , smoking cigarettes . It was not the regulation way , but Franci did not care for that . That beast of a Rento was asleep , snoring like a pig that he was , while his betters must keep awake and gaze at this desolating prospect ; the Patron was in the cabin with the miser , and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner . He , Franci , would make himself as comfortable as might be , and would not care a puff of his cigar if the schooner and all that were in it , except himself , should go to the bottom the next minute . No ! Rather would he dance for joy , and wave his hand , and cry , " Good voyage , Patron ! Good voyage , brute of a pig-faced Rento ! Good voyage , old ' Nautilus ! ' Go all to the bottom with my blessing , and I dance on the wharf , and marry the pretty Lena , and get all the old miser 's money , and wear velvet coats . Ah ! Franci , my handsome little boy , why did you let them send you to sea , hearts of stone that they were ! You , born to shine , to adorn , to break the hearts of maidens ! Why ? tell me that ! " He waved his legs in the air , and contemplated with delight their proportions , which were certainly exquisite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is it ! Otherwise one might better be a swine , yes , truly ! " At this point , perhaps , Rento appeared , rubbing his eyes , evidently just awake , and ready to take his watch ; whereupon the beautiful one sat up , and , fixing his eyes on his fellow-seaman , executed a series of grimaces which did great credit to his invention and power of facial expression . Then he delivered himself of an harangue in purest Spanish , to the effect that the day was not far distant when he , Franci , would slit Rento 's nose with a knife , and carve his initials on his cheeks , and finally run him through the so detestable body and give him to the fish to devour , though with strong fears of his disagreeing with them . To which Rento replied that he might try it just as soon as he was a mind to , but that at this present moment he was to get out ; which the beautiful youth accordingly did , retiring with a dancing step , expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the scene in the little cabin was a curious one . A lamp burned brightly on the table , and its lights shone on a number of objects , some lying openly on the green table-cover , some reclining superbly in velvet-lined cases . Shells ! Yes , but not such shells as were heaped in profusion on shelf and counter . Those were lovely , indeed , and some of them of considerable value ; but it was a fortune , no less , that lay now spread before the eyes of the Skipper and his guest . For these were the days when fine shells could not be bought on every hand , as they can to-day ; when a good specimen of the Imperial Harp brought two hundred and fifty dollars easily , and when a collector would give anything , even to the half of his kingdom ( if he were a collector of the right sort ) , for a Precious Wentletrap . Illustration It was a Wentletrap on which the little red eyes of Mr. Endymion Scraper were fixed at this moment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet , and the wonderful shell shone purely white against the glowing colour ,  - -  snow upon ice ; for the body of the shell was semi-transparent , the denser substance of the spiral whorls turning them to heavy snow against the shining clearness beneath them . Has any of my readers seen a Precious Wentletrap ? Then he knows one of the most beautiful things that God has made . Apparently the Skipper had just opened the case , for Mr. Scraper was sitting with his mouth wide open , staring at it with greedy , almost frightened eyes . Truly , a perfect specimen of this shell was , in those days , a thing seen only in kings ' cabinets ; yet no flaw appeared in this , no blot upon its perfect beauty . The old miser sat and stared , and only his hands , which clutched the table-cloth in a convulsive grasp , and his greedy eyes , showed that he was not turned to stone . He had been amazed enough by the other treasures , as the Skipper had taken them one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now hung idly open . Where had been seen such Pheasants as these ,  - -  the fragile , the exquisite , the rarely perfect ? Even the Australian Pheasant , rarest of all , lay here before him , with its marvellous pencillings of rose and carmine and gray . Mr. Endymion 's mouth had watered at the mere description of the shell in the catalogue , but he had never thought to see one , except the imperfect specimen in the museum at Havenborough . Here , too , was the Orange Cowry ; here the Bishop 's Mitre , and the precious Voluta Aulica ; while yonder ,  - -  what was this man , that he should have a Voluta Junonia , of which only a few specimens are possessed in the known world ? What did it all mean ? The Skipper sat beside the table , quiet and self-contained as usual . His arm lay on the table , his hand was never far from the more precious shells , and his eyes did not leave the old man 's face ; but he showed no sign of uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Endymion with his left hand and set him at any minute at the top of the cabin stairs ? Now and then he took up a shell with apparent carelessness ( though in reality he handled them with fingers as fine as a woman 's , knowing their every tenderest part , and where they might best be approached without offence to their delicacy ) , looked it over , and made some remark about its quality or value ; but for the most part he was silent , letting the shells speak for themselves and make their own effect . The old man had been wheezing and grunting painfully for some minutes , opening and shutting his hands , and actually scratching the table-cloth in his distress . At length he broke out , after a long silence . " Who are ye , I want to know ? How come you by these shells ? I know something about what they 're wuth -- that is -- well , I know they ai nt wuth what you say they are , well enough ; but they air wuth a good deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what you 're after here ! What do you want , and why do you show me these things if -- if -- you come by them honestly . Hey ? " The Skipper smiled meditatively . " Yes ! " he said , " we all like to know things ,  - -  part of our nature , sir -- part of our nature . I , now , I like to know things , too . What you going to do with that boy , Mr. Scrape ? I like to know that . You tell me , and perhaps you hear something about the shells , who know ? " The old man 's face darkened into a very ugly look . " My name is Scraper , thank ye , not Scrape ! " he said , dryly ; " and as for the boy , I do n't know exactly where you come in there . " The Skipper nodded . " True ! " he said , tracing with his finger the fine lines of the Voluta Aulica ; " you do not know where I come in there . In us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I at the least am acquaint with your name . It is a fine name you have there ,  - -  Endymion ! You should be a person of poetry , with this and your love for shells , hein ? You love , without doubt , to gaze on the moon , Sir Scraper ? You feel with her a connection , yes ? " " What the dickens are you talking about ? " asked the old gentleman , testily . " How much do you want to swindle me out of for this Junonia , hey ? not that I shall buy it , mind ye ! " " Three hundred ! " said the Skipper ; " and a bargain at that ! " CHAPTER V. MYSTERY . John was at work in the garden . At least , so it would have appeared to an ordinary observer ; in reality he was carrying on a sanguinary combat , and dealing death on every side . His name was George Washington , and he was at Bunker Hill ( where he certainly had no business to be ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 've just got down into the ground , they are so frightened ! " he said to himself , pausing to straighten his aching back , and toss the red curls out of his eyes . " See ' em , all scrooched down , with their feet in the earth , trying to make believe they grow there ! But I 'll have ' em out ! Whack ! there goes the general . Come out , I say ! " He wrestled fiercely with an enormous Britisher , disguised as a stalk of pig-weed , and , after a breathless tussle , dragged him bodily out of the ground , and flung his headless corpse on the neighbouring pile of weeds . " Ha ! that was fine ! " cried the boy . " I should n't be a bit surprised if that was George the Third himself ; it was ugly enough for him . Come up here ! hi ! down with you ! Now Jack the Giant-Killer is coming to help me , and the British have got Cormoran ( this was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a terrible row . " But General Washington waves his gallant sword , and calls to his men , and says ,  --  " Good morning , sir ! you make a busy day , I see . " It was not General Washington who spoke . It was the Skipper , and he was leaning on the gate and looking at the boy John and smiling . " You make a busy day , " he repeated . " I think there are soon no more weeds in Sir Scraper 's garden . " " Oh , yes ! " cried John , straightening himself again , and leaning on his trusty hoe . " There 'll be just as many -- I beg your pardon ! Good morning ! I hope you are well ; it is a very fine day . There 'll be just as many of them to-morrow , or next day , certainly . I make believe they are the British , you see , and I 've been fighting all the morning , and I do think they are pretty well licked by this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . I like them for that , do n't you ? Even though it is a bother to go on fighting all the days of one 's life . " " I also have noticed that of the British ! " the Skipper said , nodding gravely . " But now you can rest a little , Juan Colorado ? Sir Scraper is at home , that you call him for me , say I desire to make him the visit ? " " No , he is n't at home , " said John . " He 's gone down to the store for his mail . But please come in and wait , and he 'll be back soon . Do come in ! It -- it 's cool to rest , after walking in the sun . " It was the only inducement the child could think of , but he offered it with right good-will . The Skipper assented with a smile and a nod , and the two passed into the house together . In the kitchen , which was the living-room of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and prepared to play the host as well as he could ; but the visitor seemed , for some reason , not to fancy the kitchen . He looked around with keen , searching eyes , scanning every nook and corner in the bare little room . Truly , there was not much to see . The old fireplace had been blocked up , and in its place was the usual iron cooking-stove , with a meagre array of pots and pans hanging behind it . The floor was bare ; the furniture , a table and chair , with a stool for John . There was no provision for guests ; but that did not matter , as Mr. Scraper never had guests . Altogether , there was little attraction in the kitchen , and the Skipper seemed curiously displeased with its aspect . " There is no other room ? " he asked , after completing his survey . " No better room than this , Colorado ? Surely , there must be one other ; yes , of course ! " he added , as if struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scraper has shells . They are -- where ? " He paused and looked sharply at the boy . Little John coloured high . " The -- the shells ? " he stammered . " Yes , of course , sir , the shells are in another room , in the parlour ; but -- but -- I am not let go in there , unless Mr. Scraper sends me . " " So ! " said the dark man ; " but for me , Colorado , how is it for me ? Mr. Scraper never said to me that I must not go in this parlour , you see . For you it is well , you do as you are told ; you are a boy that makes himself to trust ; for me , I am a Skipper from the Bahamas , I do some things that are strange to you , among them , this . I go into the parlour . " He nodded lightly , and leaving the child open-mouthed in amazement , opened the sacred door , the door of the best parlour , and went in , as unconcernedly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door ,  - -  he surely might go as far as the door , if he did not step over the threshold ,  - -  watched him , and his eyes grew wider and wider , and his breath came quicker and quicker . For the Skipper was doing strange things , as he had threatened . Advancing quickly into the middle of the room , he cast around him the same searching glance with which he had scanned the kitchen . He went to the window , and threw back the blinds . The sunlight streamed in , as if it , too , were eager to see what shrouded treasures were kept secluded here . Probably the blinds had not been thrown back since Gran'ther Scraper died . The parlour was scarcely less grim than the kitchen , though there was a difference in its grimness . Seven chairs stood against the wall , like seven policemen with their hands behind their backs ; a table crouched in the middle , its legs bent as if to spring . The boy John considered the table a monster , transformed by magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any moment , and to leap at the unwary intruder . Its faded cover , with two ancient ink-blots which answered for eyes , fostered this idea , which was a disquieting one . On the wall hung two silver coffin-plates in a glass case , testifying that Freeborn Scraper , and Elmira his wife , had been duly buried , and that their coffins had presented a good appearance at the funeral . But the glory of the room , in the boy John 's eyes , was the cabinet of shells which stood against the opposite wall . He had once thought this the chief ornament of the world ; he knew better now , but still he regarded its treasures with awe and veneration , and looked to see the expression of delight which should overspread the features of his new friend at sight of it . What , then , was his amazement to see his new friend pass over the cabinet with a careless glance , as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world ! Evidently , it was not shells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more mystified . Suddenly the dark eyes lightened ; the whole face flashed into keen attention . What had the Skipper seen ? Nothing , apparently , but the cupboard in the corner , the old cupboard where Mr. Scraper kept his medicines . The old man had sent John to this cupboard once , when he himself was crippled with rheumatism , to fetch him a bottle of the favourite remedy of the day . John remembered its inward aspect , with rows of dusty bottles , and on the upper shelf , rows of still more dusty papers . What could the Skipper see to interest him in the corner cupboard ? Something , certainly ! For now he was opening the cupboard , quietly , as if he knew all about it and was looking for something that he knew to be there . " Ah ! " said the Skipper ; and he drew a long breath , as of relief . " True , the words ! In the corner of the parlour , a cupboard of three corners , with bottles filled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bottles , the papers ! A day of fortunes ! " He bent forward , and proceeded to rummage in the depths of the cupboard ; but this was too much for John 's conscience . " I beg your pardon , sir ! " he said , timidly . " But -- do you think you ought to do that ? " The Skipper looked out of the cupboard for an instant , and his eyes were very bright . " Yes , Colorado , " he said . " I think I ought to do this ! Oh , very much indeed , my friend , I ought to do this ! And here , "  - -  he stepped back , holding something in his hand ,  --  " here , it is done ! No more disturbance , Colorado ; I thank you for your countenance . " Do we now make a promenade in the garden , to see your work ? " Yet , " he added , pausing and again looking around him , " but yet once more I observe . This room , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parlour any better than he had liked the kitchen --  " this room , to live in ! a young person , figure it , Colorado ! gentle , with desires , with dreams of beauty , and this only to behold ! For companion an ancient onion ,  - -  I say things that are improper , my son ! I demand pardon ! But for a young person , a maiden to live here , would be sad indeed , do you think it ? " John pondered , in wonder and some trouble of mind . There was something that he had to say , something very hard ; but it would not be polite just now , and he must answer a question when he was asked . " I -- I thought it was a fine room ! " he said at length , timidly . " It is n't as bright , somehow , as where I used to live with my mother , and -- it seems to stay shut up , even when it is n't ; but -- I guess it 's a fine room , sir ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all out-doors , you know , and that 's never shut up . " " True ! " cried the Skipper , with a merry laugh ; " out of doors is never shut up , praise be to Heaven ! " He pulled off his cap , and looked up at the shining sky . They were standing on the door-step now , and John noticed that his companion seemed much less grave than usual . He laughed , he patted the boy on the shoulder , he hummed snatches of strange , sweet melodies . Once or twice he broke out into speech , but it was foreign speech , and John knew nothing save that it was something cheerful . They walked about the garden , and the Skipper surveyed John 's work , and pronounced it prodigious . He questioned the child closely , too , as to how he lived , and what he did , and why he stayed with Mr. Scraper . But the child could tell him little . He supposed it was all right ; his mother was dead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his father 's uncle , and that the latter had appointed him guardian over John in case of the mother 's death . That was all , he guessed . " All , my faith ! " cried the Skipper , gayly . " Enough , too , Colorado ! quite enough , in the opinion of me . But I go , my son ! Till a little while ; you will come to-day to the ' Nautilus , ' yes ? " But little John stood still in the path , and looked up in his friend 's face . The time had come when he must do the hard thing , and it was harder even than he had thought it would be . His throat was very dry , and he tried once or twice before the words would come . At last --  " I beg your pardon ! " he said . " I am only a little boy , and perhaps there is something I do n't understand ; but -- but -- I do n't think you ought to have done that ! " " Done what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing down at him with the bright , kind eyes that he loved , and that would not be kind the next moment , perhaps . " What is it I have done ? " " To take the papers ! " said John ; and now his voice was steady , and he knew quite well what he must say , if only his heart would not beat so loud in his ears ! " I do n't think it was right ; but perhaps you know things that make it right for you . But -- but Mr. Scraper left me here , to take care of the house , and -- and I shall have to tell him that you went into the parlour and took things out of the cupboard . " There was silence for a moment ,  - -  silence , all but the throbbing that seemed as if it must deafen the child , as it was choking him . He stood looking at the ground , his face in a flame , his eyes full of hot , smarting tears . Was it he who had stolen the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish of confusion . And the Skipper did not speak ! And this was his friend , the first heart-friend the child had ever had , perhaps the only one that would ever come to him , and he was affronting him , casting him off , accusing him of vileness ! Unable to bear the pain any longer , the child looked up at last , and as he did so , the tears overflowed and ran down his round cheeks . The dark eyes were as kind as ever . They were smiling , oh , so tenderly ! John hid his face on his blue sleeve , and sobbed to his heart 's content ; somehow , without a word , the dreadful pain was gone , and the blessed feeling had returned that this friend knew all about things , and understood little boys , and liked them . The Skipper did not speak for a moment , only stood and stroked the boy 's curly hair with a light , soft touch , almost as his mother used to stroke it . Then he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than music , John thought . " Colorado ! my little son , my friend ! " That was enough for a few minutes , till the sobs were quieted , and only the little breast heaved and sank , tremulously , like the breast of a frightened bird . Then the Skipper led him to a rustic bench , and sat down beside him , and took his hand . " And that hurt you to say , my little son ? " he said , smiling . " That hurt you , because you thought it would vex the friend from the Bahamas , the friend who steals . And yet you like him a little , is it not ? " " Oh ! " cried John , looking up with all his heart in his blue eyes ; and no other word was needed . " See , then ! " the Skipper went on , still holding the boy 's hand ; " it is that you are right , Colorado , oh , very right , my son ! and I , who am old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , I thought not of this . Yes , you must tell Sir Scraper , if -- if I do not tell him first . " He was silent a moment , thinking ; and then continued , speaking slowly , choosing his words with care : " Is it that you think , Colorado , it would be wrong to wait a little before you tell Sir Scraper -- if I said , till to-morrow ? If I ask you to wait , and then , if I have not told him , you shall tell him ,  - -  what do you say of that , my son ? " John looked helplessly around , his blue eyes growing big and wistful again . " If -- if he should ask me ! " he said . " I am sure you know all about it , and that it is all right for you , but if he should ask me -- you see -- I -- I should have to answer him , should n't I ? " " You would have to answer him ! " the Skipper repeated , frowning thoughtfully . " And you could not tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colorado ? Wait then , that your friend thinks . The mind moves at times slowly , my son , slowly ! " He was silent , and John watched him , breathless . Presently , " Will you come with me , Colorado ? " asked the Skipper . " I invite you to come , to spend the day on the ' Nautilus , ' to play with Jack and Jim , to polish the shells ,  - -  what you please . I desire not longer to wait here , I desire not that yet Sir Scraper know of my visit . Had he been here , other happenings might have been ; as it is -- shortly , will you come with me , Colorado ? " John shut his eyes tight , and took possession of his soul . " I promised ! " he said , " I promised him that if he would not whip me this morning I would not stir off the place . He was mad because I went yesterday , and he was going to give me a good one this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so -- I promised that ! But if I had known you were coming , " he cried , " I would not have promised , and I would have taken three good ones , if I could only go . " The Skipper nodded , and was silent again . Suddenly he rose to his feet . " Have you heard of pirates , Colorado ? " he asked , abruptly . John nodded , wondering . " Of Malay pirates ? " the Skipper continued , with animation . " They are wild fellows , those ! They come , they see a person , they carry him off , to keep at their fancy , till a ransom is paid , or till he grow old and die , or till they kill him the next day , who knows ? But not all are bad fellows , and there are some of them who are kind to captives , who take them on board their ships , play with them , show to them strange things , shells and fish and corals , all things . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sometimes , " the boy admitted , wondering still more at the brightness in his friend 's look , and his air of sudden determination . " I never played Malay , only Portugee ; I thought they were n't so cruel , but I do n't know . I had a ship down by the wharf , and I made a good many pirate voyages round the wharf , and sometimes quite a piece down river , when I could get the time . But then , after a while , I thought it was nicer to be a rescuing ship , and get folks away from the pirates , you know , so I 've done that lately , and I 've rescued as many as twenty vessels , I should think . " " That was fine ! " said the Skipper , nodding sagely . " That was well done , Colorado ! But here we come to trouble , do you see ? for I that speak to you -- I am a Malay pirate ! " The boy started violently and looked up , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that bent down over him ; but no ! it was the same quiet , dark face , only there was a bright gleam in the eyes . A gleam of fun , was it ? Surely not of ferocity . " I come up this river , " the Skipper continued , rapidly , " to see what I find , perhaps gold , perhaps silver , perhaps prisoners of value . I look about , I see the pleasant village , I see persons very amiable , but no precious thing except one ; that one , I have it ! I am a Malay pirate , Colorado , and thus I carry off my prize ! " and picking up the child as if he were a feather , and tossing him up to his shoulder , the Skipper strode from the garden , and took his way toward the wharf . CHAPTER VI . MR . BILL HEN . Mr. Bill Hen Pike had come to have a good long gossip . It was some time since a schooner had come up the river , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly thirsting for maritime intelligence . He desired to know the tonnage of the " Nautilus , " her age , where she was built , and by whom ; her original cost , and what sums had been expended in repairs since she had been in the Skipper 's possession ; how many trips she had made , to what ports , and with what cargoes ; the weather that had been encountered on each and every trip . These things and many more of like import did the Skipper unfold , sitting at ease on the cabin table , while Mr. Bill Hen tilted the only chair in rhythmic content . His hat was tilted , too ; his broad red face shone with pleasure ; the world was a good place to him , full of information . At last the questions came to an end ; it seemed a pity , but there was really nothing left to ask , since it appeared that the Skipper was unmarried and had no relations . But now the Skipper 's own turn had come , and quietly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the return game . " You have been at sea a large part of your life , Senor Pike ? " " Oh , yes ! yes ! I 'm well used to the sea . That is -- off and on , you know , off and on . I was mate on a coasting schooner , saw a good deal that way , you know ; like the sea first-rate , but my wife , she wo n't hear to my going off nowadays , and there 's the farm to ' tend to , stock and hay , var'ous things , var'ous things ; all about it , my sea-going days are over , yes , yes ! Pleasant place , though , pleasant place , though the strength going out of my legs makes it troublesome by times , yes , yes ! Been in these parts before , you said ? Oh , no ! said you had n't ; beg your pardon ! Pleasant part of the country ! good soil , good neighbours . " " Fine country , I should suppose ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the persons agreeable for knowledge . You know the boy whom I hear called John , with the old gentleman who collects shells ? " " Oh ! ho ! " said Mr. Bill Hen , delighted to find a fresh subject of interest . " Deacon Scraper , yes , yes ! well named , sir , Deacon Scraper is , well named , you see ! Very close man , pizeon close they do say . Lived here all his life , Deacon Scraper has , and made a fortune . Scraped it , some say , out of folks as were n't so well off as he , but I do n't know . Keen after shells , the old gentleman , yes , yes ! like liquor to him , I 've heard say . Never a man to drink or what you might call royster , no way of the world but just that ; but get him off to Boston , or any place where there were shells to be bought , and he 'd come home fairly drunk with ' em , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cur'ous , too , for such an old rip as Dym Scraper , to care for such things ; but we 're made sing'lar , one one way , and ' nother one t' other . That 's so , I reckon , in your part of the world as well as hereabouts ? " The Skipper bowed his head gravely . " The nature of humans is without doubt the same in many lands , " he said . " The little boy whom I hear called John ,  - -  he is of near blood to this old gentleman , yes ? " But here Mr. Bill Hen grew redder in the face , which was a difficult feat , and smote the cabin table . " Burning shame it is about that youngster ! " he declared . " Burning shame , if ever there was one in this mortal world . How some folks can set by and see things going on as they 're going on , beats me , and le ' me say I 'm hard to beat . That child , sir , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandf'ther or grandm'ther , in the land of the living . His father was some kind of a natural , I guess , or else he had n't known Deacon Scraper by sight or hearing ; but when he dies what does he do but leave that old -- old -- beetle-bug guardeen of that child , case of his mother dyin ' . Well , if I 'd ha ' had children , I might leave ' em to a fox for guardeen , or I might leave ' em to a horned pout , whichever I was a mind to , but I would n't leave ' em to Dym Scraper , and you can chalk that up on the door any ways you like . " The good man paused , and puffed and snorted for some minutes in silence . The Skipper waited , his dark face quietly attentive , his eyes very bright . " Near blood ? " Mr. Bill Hen broke out again , with another blow on the table . " No , he ai nt so dretful near blood , if you come to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father , Johnny 's father , was son to Freeborn Scraper , the Deacon 's twin brother . Twins they was , though no more alike than pork and peas . Them two , and Zenoby , the sister , who married off with a furriner and was never heerd of again ; but she ai n't in the story , though some say she was her father 's favourite , and that Dym gave her no peace , after Freeborn left , till he got rid of her . All about it , Freeborn went West young , and spent his days there ; lived comfortable , and left means when he died . Dym Scraper , he went out to the funeral , and run it , we heerd , Freeborn 's wife being dead and his son weakly ; anyway , he brung back them two silver coffin-plates that hangs in the parlour to his house . Next thing we knew -- good while after , y ' understand , but first thing we knew , here to the village -- the son was dead , too ; Mahlon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deacon Scraper went out agin , and kinder scraped round , folks reckoned , ' peared to make of the young widder , and meeched up to her , and all . Wal ! And here this last year , if she does n't up and die ! Sing'lar gift folks has for dying out in them parts ; living so fur from the sea , I 've always cal'lated . All about it , that old spider goes out the third time , and no coffin-plates this time , but he brings back the boy ; and lo , ye ! he 's made full guardeen over the child , and has him , body and soul . " Now I ai nt a malicious man , no way of the world , Mister , well , whatever your name is . But I tell you , that old weasel is laying for something ugly about that youngster . Some say he 's applied to send him to the Reform School ; good little boy as I 'd want to see . I believe it 's so . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child has , or land , and Dym Scraper means to have it . The child 's got no one in the world to look to , and folks about here are so skeered of Deacon Scraper that they 'll set by , I believe , and see a thing like that done before their eyes . I tell ye what , sir , I 'm a church-member , and I do n't want to say nothing but what 's right and proper ; but if there was a prophet anyways handy in these times ( and a mighty good thing to have round , too ) , there 'd be fire and brimstun called , down on Dym Scraper , and the hull village would turn out to see him get it , too ! " " But you , sir ! " said the Skipper , who had his knife out now , and was carving strange things on the table , as was his manner when moved . " You will not permit such a thing , a person of heart as you have the air to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous take place at your side ? " Mr. Bill Hen 's face grew purple ; he drew out a large handkerchief and wiped his forehead , puffing painfully ; there was a pause . " Married man ? " he said , at length . " No , beg your pardon , unmarried , I remember . Well , sir , you may know something of life , but there 's a sight you do n't know yet . See ? " Again there was silence , the Skipper gazing darkly at his carven runes , Mr. Bill Hen still puffing and wiping his brow . " Yes , there 's a sight you do n't know about , " he said again . " My wife , you see , she 's a good woman , there 's no better woman round ; but she 's masterful , sir , she 's masterful , and I 'm a man who 's always led a quiet life and desire peace . And there 's more behind ; though why on the airth I 'm telling you all this is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a peevish outburst , and he hesitated , as if minded to say no more ; but the Skipper raised his head , and the dark eyes sent out a compelling glance . The weaker man faltered , gave way , and resumed his speech . " She 's a masterful woman , I tell ye ! She thinks Deacon Scraper is a dangerous man , and there ai nt nobody here but what 'll agree with her that far . Then -- he -- he 's got a mortgage on my farm , same as he has on others ,  - -  plenty of others as is better clothed with means than ever I 've been ; and , all about it , my wife ai nt willing for us to make an enemy of the old man . That 's where the land lays , and you can see for yourself . Plenty in the village is fixed the same way ; he 's got power , that old grape-skin has , power over better men than he . We do n't want to see that child put upon , but we ai nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but feels that he himself ai nt just the one to interfere . That 's the way my wife feels , and I , well , there now ! you 're a stranger , and I may never set eyes on you again ; but I take to you , somehow , and I do n't mind telling you that I feel as mean as dirt whenever I think of that lamb in that old fox 's den ; mean as dirt I feel , and yet I ai nt got the spunk to -- the strenth is gone out of my legs , " he added , piteously , " these ten years back , and I think some of my spirit went with it . That 's where it is ! I haint got the spirit to stand up against ' em . " There was a long silence , and then the Skipper shut his knife with a click , and rose from the table , holding out his hand . " You are a good man , Senor Pike , " he said . " I think no worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With regard to this child , I shall remind you , "  - -  here he shook his head with a backward gesture in which there was something at once proud and humble.  --  " I shall remind you that there are powers very high , more high than of prophets ; and that God will do the works as seems Him good . I may have the honour to wait upon your distinguished lady at a future day ; I think to be some days in this place , for purposes of selling my cargo , as well to take in wood and water . Never before in these parts , it is for me of interest to observe the place and people . You will take a lemonade that Franci brings ? Hola , Franci ! This is Senor Pike , Franci , at all times to be admitted to the schooner . " " Pleased to meet you ! " said Mr. Bill Hen . " Servicio de Usted ! " said Franci , who did not understand English except when he thought the speaker was likely to interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER VII . THE CAPTIVE . " Franci ! " the Skipper called up the companion-way , when his visitor had taken his departure . " Senor ! " said Franci , putting his beautiful head over the rail . " Bring me here the child , hear thou ! " " Si , Senor , " said Franci . He went forward , and pulling aside a pile of canvas that lay carelessly heaped together in a corner of the deck , disclosed the boy John , curled up in a ball , with one monkey in his arms , and the other sitting on his shoulder . " Here , you , Sir Schoolmaster , the Patron ask for you . I give you my hand to hellup you up ! I like to put a knife in you ! " he added in Spanish , with an adorable smile . " You 'd get one into yourself before you had time ! " said Rento , getting up from the spot where his length had been coiled , and speaking with a slow drawl that lent emphasis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boy , and it 's the last you lay on anybody ,  - -  understand that ? " " Oh , yays ! " said Franci , gently , as he pulled John out of the tangle of canvas and ropes . " But I am ' most killed all my life with looking at your ugly face , you old she monkey ! A little more killing make not much difference to me . " Rento advanced toward him with uplifted hand , and the agile Spaniard slipped round the mast and disappeared . " What was he saying ? " asked John , vaguely feeling that something was wrong . " Nothin ' , nothin ' at all , " Rento said , quietly . " He was givin ' me some talk , that was all . It 's all he has to give , seemin'ly ; kind o ' fool person he is , Franci ; do n't ye take no heed what he says . There , go ' long , youngster ! the Skipper 's lookin ' for ye . " At this moment the Skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sure that he was awake . Dreams were so curious , sometimes , one never knew what would happen in them ; and this whole matter of piracy had been so strange and unlooked for that all the while he had been hidden under the sail ( where he had retreated by the Skipper 's orders as soon as Mr. Bill Hen Pike appeared in the offing ) , he had been trying to persuade himself that he was asleep , and that the monkeys were dream-monkeys , very lively ones , and that by-and-by he would wake up once more and find himself in bed at Mr. Scraper 's . But now there could be no more doubt ! He could not dream Franci , nor the queer things he said ; he could not dream Rento , with his kind , ugly face and drawling speech ; least of all could he dream the Skipper , who was now looking at him with an amused smile . Certainly , he did not look in the least like a pirate ! In the first place , Malay pirates did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and something that flew in the air behind them as they ran . For in the geography-book pictures a Malay was always running amuck , with a creese in his hand , and an expression of frantic rage on his countenance . How could this be a Malay ? Perhaps he might have been in fun ! But John was not much used to fun , and it seemed hardly likely that so grave a person as the Skipper would play at pirate . On the whole , the little boy was sadly puzzled ; and the Skipper 's first words did not tend to allay his anxiety . " Ha ! my prisoner ! " he said . " That you come here , sir , and sit down by me on the rail . The evening falls , and we will sit here and observe the fairness of the night . Remark that I put no chains on you , Colorado , as in the Malay seas we put them ! You can swim , yes ? " John nodded . " I swam across the river last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to --  " He meant to say , " to rescue some people from pirates , " but now this did not seem polite ; so he stopped short , but the Skipper took no notice . " You swim ? That is good ! " he said . " But Sir Scraper , he can not swim , I think , my son , so for you there is no rescue , since Rento has pulled in the plank . Are you content , then , to be the captive of the ' Nautilus ? ' " John looked up , still sorely puzzled ; perhaps he was rather dull , this little boy John , about some things , though he was good at his books . At any rate , there could be no possible doubt of the kindness in the Skipper 's face ; perhaps he was in fun , after all ; and , anyhow , where had he ever been so happy as here since the good mother died ? So he answered with right good-will ,  --  " I like to stay here more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Mr. Scraper would be angry and frightened about me , and not know where I was , I should like to stay on board all my life . " " That is right ! " said the Skipper , heartily . " That is the prisoner that I like to have . I am not a cruel pirate , as some ; I like to make happy my captives . Franci , lemonade , on the after-deck here ! " He spoke in Spanish , and Franci replied in the same language , with a faint voice expressive of acute suffering . " I am very sick , Patron . I go to my bed in a desolated condition . " " Come here , and let me look at you ! " said the Skipper , imperatively . " Am I a dog , to fetch drink for this beggar brat ? " was Franci 's next remark , in a more vigorous tone . " Was it for this that I left San Mateo ? Rento is a pig , let him do the pig things . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , but the Skipper reached out a long arm , and the next moment the bold youth was dangling over the side of the vessel , clutching at the air , and crying aloud to all the saints in the calendar . " Shall I let go ? " asked the Skipper , in his quiet tone . " Ah ! no , distinguished Patron ! " cried Franci . " Let me not go ! This water is abominable . Release me , and I will get the lemonade . It is my wish that you may both be drowned in it , but I will get it ,  - -  oh , yes , assuredly ! " He was set down , and vanished into the cabin ; the Skipper , as if this were the most ordinary occurrence in the world , led the way to the after-rail , and seated himself , motioning to John to take a place beside him . " What is the matter with him ? " asked the boy , looking after Franci . " I think him slightly a fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his cigar . " His parents , worthy people , desired him to be a sailor , but that he can never be . The best sailor is one born for that , and for no other thing ; also , a sailor can be made , though not of so fine quality ; but of Franci , no . I return him after this voyage , with compliments , and he sails no more in the ' Nautilus . ' And you , Colorado ? How is it with you ? You love not at all a vessel , I think ? " There certainly could be no doubt this time that the Skipper was making fun ; his face was alive with it , and John could have laughed outright for pleasure . " I do n't believe you are a Malay , one bit ! " said the child . " I 'm not sure that you are a pirate at all , but I know you are n't a Malay . " " Why that , my son ? " asked the Skipper , waving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the clearer . " Why do you think that ? I am not dark enough for a Malay , is it that ? " " No , not that , " John admitted . " But -- well , you have no creese , and you are not wild , nor -- nor fierce , nor cruel . " " But I have the creese ! " the Skipper protested . " The creese , would you see it ? It is in the cabin , behind the door , with other arms of piracy . Still , Colorado , it is of a fact that I was not born in Polynesia , no . As to the fierceness and the cruelty , we shall see , my son , we shall see . If I kept you here on the ' Nautilus ' always , took you with me away , suffered you no more to live with your gentle Sir Scraper , that would be cruelty , do you think it ? That would be a fierce pirate , and a cruel one , who would do that ? " John raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend 's face . " Of course , I know you are only in fun , " he said , at last , " because dreams do n't really come true ; but -- but that was my dream , you know ! I think I 've dreamed you all my life . At least -- well , I never knew just what you looked like , or how you would come ; but I always dreamed that some one would come from the sea , and that I should hear about the shells , and know what they were saying when they talk ; and --  " he paused ; but the Skipper patted his shoulder gently , in sign that he understood . " And -- what else , Juan Colorado ? " he asked , in what seemed the kindest voice in the world . But the boy John hung his head , and seemed loth to go on . " There -- there was another part to what I dreamed , " he said at last . " I guess I wo n't tell that , please , ' cause , of course , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell it , " said the Skipper , lightly , " even if it come not true ? Dreams are pretty things ; my faith , I love to dream mine self . Tell thy friend , Colorado ! tell the dream , all the wholeness of it . " There was no resisting the deep , sweet voice . The little boy raised his head again , and looked frankly into the kind , dark eyes . " I used to dream that I was taken away ! " he said , in a low voice . " Away ? Good ! " the Skipper repeated . " Away , " the boy murmured , and his voice grew soft and dreamy . " Away from the land , and the fields where the grass dries up so soon , and winter comes before you are ready to be cold . Some one would come and take me in a ship , and I should live always on the water , and it would rock me like a cradle , and I should feel as if I had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolphins , and know how the corals grow , and see things under the sea . And nobody would beat me then , and I should not have to split wood when it makes my back ache . That was the other part of my dream . " The Skipper laid his hand lightly on the child 's head and smoothed back the red curls . " Who knows ? " he said , with a smile . " Who knows what may come of dreams , Colorado ? Here the one-half is come true , already at this time . Why not the other ? " He turned away as if to change the subject , and took up a piece of the white branching coral that lay at his elbow . " When I gather this , " he said in a lighter tone , " it was a day in the last year ; I remember well that day ! A storm had been , and still the sea was rough a little , but that was of no matter . Along the island shore we were cruising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , fine trees . " " Trees ? " repeated the wondering child . " Of coral , naturally ! " said the Skipper . " Coral trees , Juan , shining bright , bright , through the green water . " ' Hola , you ! lower anchor ! ' " It is done . I put on the diving dress . I take a rope about my waist , I descend . There a forest I find ; very beautiful thing to see . Here we see green trees , and in your north , in fall of year , bright colours , but there colours of rainbow all the year round . In one place bright yellow , branch and twig of gold purely ; the next , purple of a king 's garment , colour of roses , colour of peach-blossom in the spring . Past me , as I descend , float fans of the fan-coral , lilac , spreading a vine-work , trellis , as your word is . On the one side are cliffs of mountains , with caves in their sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the band-fish , a long ribbon of silver with rose shining through ; the Isabelle fish , it is violet and green and gold , like a queen . Under my feet , see , Colorado ! sand white like the snow of your winter , fine , shining with many bright sparks . And this is a garden ; for all on every hand flowers are growing . You have seen a cactus , that some lady keeps very careful in her window , tending that it die not ? Yes ! Here is the white ground covered with these flowers completely , only of more size hugely , crimson , pale , the heart of a rose , the heart of a young maiden . Sea-anemones are these , Colorado , many , many kinds , all very fine to see . And here , too , on the ground are my shells , not as here , when of their brightness the half is gone for want of the life and the water , but full of gleams very glorious , telling of greatness in their making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find persons many who doubt of a great God who maketh all things for good , and to grow in the end better ; but to have been under the sea , that is to know that it can not be otherwise ; a true sailor learns many things that are not fully known upon the land , where one sees not so largely His mercy . " He was silent for a moment , and then went on , the child sitting rapt , gazing at him with eyes which saw all the wonders of which he told . " All these things I saw through the clear water , as if through purest glass I looked . I broke the branches , which now you see white and cleaned , but then all splendid with these colours whereof I tell you . Many branches I broke , putting them in pouches about my waist and shoulders . At once , I see a waving in the water , over my head ; I look up to see a shark swim slowly round and round , just having seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife ready , for often have I met this gentleman before . I slip behind the coral tree , and wait ; but he is a stupid beast , the shark , and knows not what to do when I come not out . So up I quickly climb through the branches , with care not to tangle the rope ; he still looking for me at the spot where first he saw me . I gain the top , and with a few pulls of my good Rento on the rope , I am in the boat , and Sir Shark is snapping his teeth alone , very hungry , but not invited to dinner . " " Do you think he was stronger than you ? " asked the little boy . " You 're very strong , are n't you ? I should think you were as strong as sharks , and ' most as strong as whales . " The Skipper laughed . " Sir Shark is ten times so strong as any man , let him be of the best , my friend ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes the difference . And you , could you do that , too ? Could you keep yourself from fear , when the sea-creatures come about you , if you should ever be a sailor ? What think you ? " The child pondered . " I think I could ! " he said at last . " I never saw any such things , of course , but I 'm not afraid of anything that I know about , here on shore . There was a snake , " he went on , lowering his voice , " last summer there was a snake that lived in a hole by the school-house , and he was a poison snake , an adder . One day he crept out of his hole and came into the school-house , and scared them all ' most to death . The teacher fainted away , and all the children got up into a corner on the table , and the snake had the whole floor to himself . But it looked funny to see them all that way over a little beast that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about it , and then I went to the wood-box ( we were burning brushwood then ) and got a stick with a little fork at the end , and I came up quick behind the snake , and clapped that down over his neck , so he could n't turn his head round , and then I took another stick and killed him . That 's only a little thing , but I was n't afraid at all , and I thought perhaps it would show whether I would be good for anything when there were real things to be afraid of . " The Skipper nodded in his pleasant , understanding way . " I think so , too , Colorado , " he said . " I think so , too ! That was like my boy Rento , but not like Franci . Franci dies every time he see a snake , and come to life only to find out if somebody else is killed . See , my son , how beautiful the moon on the water ! Let us look for a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must send my little friend to his bed , that nothing harmful comes to him . " So they sat hand in hand for awhile , gazing their fill , saying nothing ; there was the same look in the two faces , so widely different . The little boy , with his clear brow , his blue eyes limpid as a mountain pool , shining with the heavens reflected in them ; the dark Spaniard ( if he were a Spaniard ! ) with lines of sadness , shadows of thought and of bitter experience , making his bronze face still darker ; what was there alike in these two , who had come together from the ends of the earth ? The thought was one , in both hearts , and the look of it shone in the eyes of both as they sat in the moonlight white and clear . What was the thought ? Look into the face of your child as it kneels to pray at close of day ! Look into the face of any good and true man when he is lifted above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery , and hears the eternal voices sounding ! " ' Morning , evening , noon and night , Praise God ! ' sang Theocrite . " CHAPTER VIII . IN THE NIGHT . The evening had been peaceful , all beauty and silence ; but not so the night for the boy John . Something was the matter ; he could not sleep . The bunk in the little cabin was comfortable enough for anyone , but to him it was a couch for an emperor . He speculated on the probability of George the Third 's having had anything like so luxurious a bed , and rejected the thought as absurd . There were no lumps in the mattress , neither any holes through which sharp fingers of straw came out and scratched him . The red curtains at the sides could be drawn at will , and , drawing them , he found himself in a little world of his own , warm and still and red . The shells were outside in the other world ; he could look out at any moment and see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend had said so . Now , however , it seemed best just to be alive , and to stay still and wonder what would become of him . He heard the Skipper come down and go to bed , and soon the sound of deep , regular breathing told that he slept , the man of wonder ; but John could not sleep . And now other thoughts came thronging into his mind , thoughts that were not soft and crimson and luxurious . To go away , as the Skipper had said , to go to heaven ! But one did not go to heaven till the time came . Was it right ? Was the Skipper a good man ? The child debated the question with anguish , lying with wide open eyes in his crimson-shaded nest . Mr. Scraper was -- not -- very nice , perhaps ; but he had taken him , John , when his mother died , and fed and clothed him . He had often had enough to eat -- almost enough -- and -- and Mr. Scraper was old , and perhaps pretty soon his legs would go to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to walk at all , and then how would it be if he were left alone ? Perhaps people would not come to help him , as they had helped the captain , because everybody in the village loved the captain , and no one exactly loved Mr. Scraper . So if the only person who belonged to him at all should go off and leave him , how could it be expected that the folks who had their own grandfathers and things to take care of would stop and go to take care of this old man ? And if he should die there , all alone , with no one to read to him or bring him things , or feed him with a spoon , why ,  - -  how would it seem to himself , the boy John 's self , when he should hear of it ? " I am a murderer ! " he said aloud ; and straightway , at the sound of his own voice , cowered under the bedclothes , and felt the hangman 's hand at his neck . What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a man in an old book there at the house , and he was wicked , and he never could sleep , never at all . The things he had done came and sat on him , and they were hot , like coals , and the heat went through to his heart and burned it . Would it be so with him , if he should go away in the " Nautilus , " and forget -- or try to forget -- the old man who had nobody to love him ? Not that Mr. Scraper wanted to be loved yet , at all ; but -- but he might , some time , when his legs had gone to sleep , and then --  Sometimes , when a person could not sleep , it meant that he was going to die . Suppose one were to die now , and go to heaven , and they said to one , " How was Mr. Scraper when you came away ? " and one had to say , " I ran away and left him this evening , and I do n't know how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old people die just like that , dropping down in their chairs -- what would they say to one ? Perhaps the old man had dropped down now , this very night , from anger at his being away when he should have done the chores " . He saw Mr. Scraper sitting in his arm-chair , cold and dead , with the rats running over the floor at his feet , because he , John , had not set the trap . A scream rose to his lips , but he choked it back ; and sitting up in desperation , drew aside the red curtains and looked out . The cabin lay dim and quiet before him . A lantern hung in the middle , turned low , and by its light he could see the shelves , with their shining rows of shells , and the glass counter with the sea-jewelry . Directly opposite him , only the narrow space of the cabin between , lay the Skipper in his bunk , sleeping peacefully . The wild fear died away in the child 's heart as he saw the calmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown out ; the strong , shapely hand lay with the palm open toward him , and there was infinite cheer and hospitality in the attitude . In the dim light the Skipper 's features looked less firm and more kind ; yet they were always kind . It was not possible that this was a bad man , a stealer of children , a pilferer of old men 's cupboards . If one could think that he had been playing all the time , making believe , just as a person did one 's self ; but John had never known any grown people who could make believe ; they had either forgotten , or else they were ashamed of the knowledge . Once , it was true , he had persuaded Mr. Bill Hen Pike to be Plymouth Rock , when he wanted to land in the " Mayflower ; " but just as the landing was about to be effected , Mrs. Pike had called wrathfully from the house , and the rock sprang up and shambled off without even a word of apology or excuse . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet ,  - -  yet if it had been play , what glorious times one could have , with a real creese , and a real schooner , and everything delightful in the world ! How could he be bad and look like that ? The child bent forward and strained his eyes on the sleeping face . So quiet , so strong , so gentle ! He tried putting other faces beside it , for he saw faces well , this boy , and remembered what he had seen . He tried Mr. Scraper 's face , with the ugly blink to the red eyes , and the two wrinkles between the eyes , and the little nest of spiteful ones that came about his mouth when he was going to be angry ; even when he slept -- the old gentleman -- his hands were clenched tight -- how different from that open palm , with its silent welcome !  - -  and his lips pursed up tight . No ! no ! that was not a pleasant picture ! Well , there was Lena ! she was pleasant to look at , surely ! Her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they could be sharp , too . But , somehow , when her face was brought here beside the Skipper 's , it looked foolish and empty , and her pretty smile had nothing to say except to bid one look and see how pretty she was , and how becoming blue was to her ; and -- and , altogether , she would not do at all . Mr. Bill Hen , then , who was always kind to him , and quite often , when . Mrs. Pike was not near , would give him a checkerberry lozenge . Mr. Bill Hen 's face was good-natured , to be sure , but oh , how coarse and red and stupid it was beside the fine dark sleeping mask ! Why did people look so different , and more when they were asleep than any other time ? Did one 's soul come out and kind of play about , and light up the person 's face ; and if so , was it not evident that the Skipper was a good man ? and that perhaps things were really different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten Commandments , and -- no , but right was right , and it did n't make any difference about countries in that sort of thing . You knew that yourself , because you felt it in your stomach when you did bad things ; perhaps when one grew older , one 's stomach did not feel so quickly . And , anyhow , if that was true about the soul , how do you suppose a person 's own soul would make his face look if he was running away from the things he ought to do , and going to play with monkeys and see the wonders of the world ? The boy wondered what he was looking like at the present moment , and summoned up the image of a frightful picture of a devil in another of those old books into which he was forever peeping at odd times . Did they miss him now , the old books in the garret , because he had not come up to wish them good-night and take a look at some of the best pictures before he went to bed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , do you suppose ? How still it was , and how queer his eyes felt ! But he could not lie down , for then he would be alone again , and the things would come and sit on him ; it was good to sit up and look at the Skipper , and wonder -- and wonder --  A gleam , faint and red , shot from a shell in the farther corner ,  - -  a splendid creature , scarlet and pale green , with horns that gave it a singularly knowing look . He almost thought it nodded to him ; and hark ! was that a tiny voice speaking , calling him by name ? " Come away , little boy ! " said the voice . " Come away to the south , where the water is blue always , and storms come rarely , rarely ! There , under the water , my brothers and sisters wait to see you , and with them their friends , the lovely ones , of whom you have dreamed all your life . There , on beds of sea-moss , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flowers are there , and stars , and bells that wave softly without sound . For one fair thing that the man , our master , told you of , we have a thousand to show you . What does he know , a man , whose eyes are already half-shut ? But you are a child , and for you all things shall be opened under the ocean , and you shall see the treasures of it , and the wonders ; and you shall grow wise , wise , so that men shall look up to you , and shall say , ' Where did he gain his knowledge ? ' And your friend shall be with you , oh yes , for he knows the way , if he can not see all the things that will meet your eyes ! And you and he together shall sail -- shall sail , through waters green as chrysoprase ; and all the sea-creatures shall learn to know you and love you . You shall learn where the sea-otter makes his nest , in the leaves of the giant sea-weed , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the Skipper told you . The ' Nautilus ' will be there , too : not a clumsy wooden mountain , like this in which we lie prisoned , but the creature itself , the fairy thing of pearl and silver ! Look ! here lies his shell , and you find it lovely ; but like us , it is dim and dead for want of the life within it . " Come away , and let us be sailing , sailing over seas of gold ! And when you are weary of the top of the waves , down you shall sink with us through the clear green water , and the night will fall like a soft dream , and the moon-fish , with its disk of silver , shall gleam beside you to light the dimness that yet is never dark ; and you shall go down , down , down --  " And about this time it must have been that the little boy went down , for when the morning broke , the Skipper found him , fast asleep , and smiling as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Bill Hen , " I only want to put it to you , you understand . Intelligent man like you , no need for me to do more than put it to you . There 's the child , and there 's the old man , and they ' pear to have got separated . I do n't want to be understood as implying anything , not anything in the living world ; but there 's where it is , you see . And me being a justice of the peace , and sworn , you observe , to -- well , I 'm sure you will see for yourself the position I 'm placed in . Point is , you seemed consid'able interested in the child , as one may say . Nothing strange in that , nice little boy ! would interest an Injin chief , if he had any human feelin ' in him . But bein ' a justice of the peace , you see , well , Mr. Scraper has sent me to make inquiries , and no offence in the world , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it -- do you know where in thunder the child is ? " Mr. Bill Hen , standing on the bank , delivered himself of these remarks with infinite confusion , perspiring freely , and wiping his face with a duster , which he had brought by mistake instead of a handkerchief . He looked piteously at the Skipper , who stood leaning over the side , cheerfully inscrutable , clad in spotless white , and smoking a long cigar . " The child ? " the Skipper repeated , thoughtfully . " You allude to the boy called John , Senor Pike ; yes , I had that suppose . Now , sir , the day before this , you tell me that this child is not well placed by that old gentleman Scraper ; that the old man is cruel , is base , is a skin-the-flint , shortly . You tell me this , and I make reply to you that there are powers more high than this old person , who have of that child charge . How , if those powers had delivered to me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pike ? " Mr. Bill Hen wiped his brow again and gasped feebly . " ' T is as I thought ! " he said . " You 've got the child aboard . " The Skipper nodded , and blew rings from his cigar . " I have the child , " he repeated , " aboard . What will you in this case do , Senor ? I propose to take him with me away , to make of him a sailor , to care for him as my son . You think well of this ; you have been kind to the child always , as he tell me ? You are glad to have him remove from the slavery of this old fish , yes ? " He smiled , and bent his dark eyes on his unhappy visitor . Mr. Bill Hen writhed upon the hook . " There -- there 's truth in what you say , " he admitted , at length , after seeking counsel in vain from his red bandanna . " There 's truth in what you say , I ai nt denyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , is my duty . You may have your idees of duty , and I may have mine ; and I 'm a justice of the peace , and I do n't see anything for it but to ask you to give up that child to his lawful guardeen , as has sent me for him . " A pause ensued , during which Franci sauntered to the side with easy grace . " Shall I put a knife into him , Patron ? " he asked , indicating Mr. Bill Hen with a careless nod . " How well he would stick , eh ? The fatness of his person ! It is but to say the word , Patron . " Mr. Bill Hen recoiled with a look of horror , and prepared for instant flight ; but the Skipper 's gesture reassured him . " Franci , look if there is a whale on the larboard bow ! " said the latter . " Perfectly , Patron ! " replied Franci , withdrawing with his most courtly bow . " When I say that no one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall break my heart ! but as you will . " Again there was a pause , while Mr. Bill Hen wondered if this were a floating lunatic asylum or a nest of pirates , that had come so easily up their quiet river and turned the world topsy-turvy . At length --  " Your force , Senor Pike , " the Skipper said , " I perceive it not , for to take away this child . Have you the milizia -- what you call soldiers , police -- have you them summoned and concealed behind the rocks , as in the theatres of Havana ? I see no one but your one self . Surely you have no thought to take the child of your own force from me ? " Mr. Bill Hen gasped again . " Look here ! " he broke out at last . " What kind of man are you , anyway ? you ai nt no kind that we 're used to in these parts , so now I tell you ! When a man hears what is law in this part of the world , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that law and that -- and -- and in short to them sentiments . Are you going to stand out against the law , and keep that child ? and who give you a right to do for that child ? I suppose I can ask that question , if you are a grandee , or whatever you are . Who give you a right , I ask ? " " Who shall say ? " replied the Skipper . " Perhaps --  " He said no more , but raised his hand with a gesture that was solemn enough ; and Mr. Bill Hen Pike decided that he was beyond doubt a madman . But now the Skipper dropped his tone and attitude of smiling ease , and , throwing away his cigar , stood upright . " Enough , Senor ! " he said . " You are a good man , but you have not the courage . Now , you shall see Colorado . " He turned toward the cabin and called : " Colorado , my son , come to me ! " Then , after a pause , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Rento , who had been hovering near , lending a careful ear to all that was said , now vanished , and reappeared , bearing the boy John in his arms . The child was but newly awake , and was still rubbing his eyes and looking about him in bewilderment . " Colorado , the Senor Pike , already well known to you ! " said the Skipper , with a graceful wave of the hand . " Your guardian , the old gentleman Scraper , desires of our company at breakfast . How then , son of mine ? Shall we go , or shall I keep you here , and bid Sir Scraper find his way to the devil , which will be for him little difficult ? " He smiled on the boy , and took his hand with a caressing gesture . Little John heaved a great sigh , and the cares of the world floated from him like a summer cloud . " Oh , I knew it ! " he cried , smiling joyously up into his friend 's face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You never meant anything but fun , did you ? and we will go back , wo n't we ? And we shall feel all right inside , and things will not sit -- I -- I mean nothing will feel bad any more . I -- I ca n't say all I mean , " he added , rather lamely , " because I had thoughts in the night ; but we will go now , you and I , you and I ! " * * * * * As they approached the gate , John stopped a moment , and looked up at his companion . " Would you mind holding my hand ? " he asked . " I am all right in my mind , but I think I am rather queer in my legs ; I think I should feel better if I held the hand of -- of somebody who was n't little , or -- or weak . " Oh , the strong , cordial pressure of the big , brown hand ! how it sent warmth and cheer and courage through the little quivering frame ! John was all right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt already the stinging blows of the cane , his ears rang already with the burning words of rage and spite . " But it is the inside that matters ! " said John , aloud ; and he shut his eyes and went into the house . " Good-morning , gentleman , " the Skipper began , always at his courteous ease . " I have to ask your forgiveness , that I carry off yesterday our young friend here . You were not at house , I desired greatly of his company ; I have the ways of the sea , waiting not too long for the things I like ; briefly , I take him away . That I bear the blame of this is my desire . And now , shall we pleasantly converse , ha ? " He seated himself , drew the boy between his knees , and looked Mr. Scraper squarely in the eyes . Now , Mr. Scraper did not like to be looked at in this manner ; he shifted on his chair , and his mouth , which had been opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spiteful snap , and then opened , and then closed again . The Skipper observed these fish-like snappings with grave attention . At length ,  --  " Who are you , I should like to know ? " the old man cried in an angry twitter . " Why in -- why do you come meddling here , and carrying off boys from their lawful guardeens , and talking folderol , and raising Ned generally ? I 've seen skippers before , but I never heered of no such actions as these , never in my days ! Why , no one here so much as knows your name ; and here you seem to own the hull village , all of a sudden . You , John , " he added , with a savage snarl , " you go about your business , and I 'll see to you afterwards . I reckon you wo n't go out again without leave for one while ! " The child started obediently , but the strong hand held him fast . " Quiet , Colorado , " said the Skipper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , plenty time ! I desire you here now , see you . " Then he turned once more to the old man . " You have , I already say , a beautiful name , Sir Scraper , " he said with cheerful interest . " Endymion ! a fine name , truly -- of poetry , of moonlight and beauty ; you have had great joy of that name , I can not doubt ? " " What 's my name to you , I should like to know ? " retorted Mr. Scraper , with acrimony . " This ai nt the first time you 've took up my name , and I 'll thank you to leave it alone ! You let go that boy , or I 'll let you know more ' n you knew before . " " Perfectly ! " said the Skipper . " Attend but a moment , dear sir . Let us pursue for a moment thoughts of poetry ! Such a name as Endymion proves a poetic fancy in the giver of it ; at a guess , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if others so fortunate as to belong to your family , surely this excellent lady would have given to them , also , names of soul , of poetry ! If there was a sister , for example , would she be named Susan ? No ! Jane ? Never ! Find me then a name ! Come ! at a venture . Zenobia ? Aha ! what say you ? " He leaned forward , and his glance was like the flash of a sword . The child looked in wonder from one to the other ; for the old man had sunk back in his chair , and his jaw had fallen open in an ugly way , and altogether he was a sad object to look at . " What -- what d'ye mean ? " he gasped , after a moment . But the Skipper went on , speaking lightly and cheerfully , as if talking of the weather . " What pleasure to bring before the mind a picture of a family so charming ! Of you , dear sir , in your gracious childhood , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished here by your side the little sister ? Ah ! the smiling picture , making glad the heart ! This sister , Zenobia , let us say , grows up , after what happy childhood with such a brother needs for me not to say . They are three , these children ,  - -  how must they love each other ! But one brother goes early away from the home ! In time comes for Zenobia , as to young maidens will come , a suitor , a foreigner , shall we say ? a man , like myself , of the sea ? May it not have been possible , dear sir ? " " A roving nobody ! " the old man muttered , striving to pull himself together . " A rascally "  - -  but here he stopped abruptly , for a stern hand was laid on his arm . " I am speaking at this present , sir ! " said the Skipper . " Of this man I do not ask you the character . I tell my story , if you please , in my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead . The father , unwilling to part with his daughter , alas ! the parental heart , how must it be torn ? As yours , the tender one , last night , on missing this beloved child , Sir Scraper . The father , I say , opposes the marriage ; at length only , and after many tears , much sorrow , some anger , consents ; the daughter , sister , Zenobia , goes with her husband away , promising quickly to return , to take her old father to her home in the southern islands . Ah , the interesting tale , is it not ? Observe , Colorado , my son , how I am able to move this , your dear guardian . The pleasant thing , to move the mind of age , so often indifferent . " Zenobia goes away , and the son , the good son , the one faithful and devoted , who will not marry , so great his love for his parent , is left with that parent alone . How happy can we fancy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days , how sweet for him the nights , lighted with love , and smoothed his pillow by loving hands , ah , the pleasant picture ! But how , my friend , you feel yourself not well ? Colorado , a glass of water for your guardian . " The old man motioned the child back , his little eyes gleaming with rage and fear . " You -- you come a-nigh me , you brat , and I 'll wring your neck ! " he gasped . " Well , Mister , have you finished your -- your story , as you call it ? Why do I want to listen to your pack of lies , I should like to know ? I wonder I 've had patience to let you go on so long . " " Why do you want to listen ? " the Skipper repeated . " My faith , do I know ? But the appearance of interest in your face so venerable , it touch me to the heart . Shall I go and tell the rest of my story to him there , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would break your heart to hear not the end . That we proceed then , though not so cheerful the ending of my story . Zenobia , in her southern home , happy , with her child at her knee , feels still in her heart the desire to see once more her father , to bring him to her , here in the warm south to end his days of age . She writes , but no answer comes ; again she writes , and again , grief in her soul , to think that anger is between her and one so dear . At last , after a long time , a letter from her brother , the stay-at-home , the faithful one ; their father is dead ; is dead ,  - -  without speaking of her ; the property is to him left , the faithful son . It is finished , it is concluded , the earth is shut down over the old man , and no more is to say . " With what tender , what loving words this cruel news tells itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yourself , Sir Scraper . Zenobia , sad woman , believes what she is told ; bows her head , gathers to her closer her husband and her son , and waits the good time when God shall make to her good old father the clear knowledge that she has always loved him . Ah , yes , my faith ! " Now , in a year , two years , I know not , what arrives ? A letter , old and worn ; a letter soiled , discoloured , of carrying long in a sailor 's pocket , but still easily to be read . This letter -- shall we guess , Sir Scraper ? Well , then , from her father ! The old man in secret , in fear , lying on his bed of death , makes come by stealth a neighbour , kindly disposed to him ; makes write by his hand this letter ; makes draw up besides , it may be , other papers , what do we know ? " Ah ! but remain quiet , dear sir . Grieved that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , that you do not yet withdraw it . Ancient fish-skin , do I tie thee in thy chair ? " So ! that is well , and you will remain quiet , Senor , with a thousand pardons ! " This letter , then , it is one to wring the heart . He has longed for his daughter , this poor old man ; in two grasping hands held as in a vise , he turns to her who was always kind , he prays her to return , to let him come to her , what she will . Failing this , and knowing that on earth the time is short for him to remain , he bids her not grieve , but send to her home a messenger of trust , and let him look for a certain paper , in a certain place . Finally , he prays for her the blessing of God , this good old man , and bids her farewell , if he may never see her more . Truly , a letter over which a pirate , even a Malay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Skipper 's voice was still quiet , but its deep tones were stern with suppressed feeling ; with menace , was it ? The child , bewildered , looked from one to the other of his two companions . The Spaniard 's eyes burned red in their depths , his glance seemed to pierce marrow and sinew ; he sat leaning lightly forward in his chair , alert , possessing himself , ready for any sudden movement on the part of his adversary ; for the old man must be his adversary ; something deadly must lie between these two . Mr. Scraper lay back in his chair like one half dead , yet the rage and spite and hatred , the baffled wonder , the incredulity struggling with what was being forced upon him , made lively play in his sunken face . His lean hands clutched the arms of the chair as if they would rend the wood ; his frame shook with a palsy . Little John wondered what could ail his guardian ; yet his own heart was stirred to its depths by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried . " He was a bad man ! Things must have sat upon his breast all night , and I am sure he could not sleep at all . Are you sorry for a person who is as bad as that ? do you think any one tried to help him to be better ? " But the Skipper raised his finger , and pointed to the evil face of the old man . " Does that man look as if he slept , my son ? " he asked . " Listen always , and you shall hear the last of the story . " " It 's a lie ! " Mr. Scraper screamed at last , recovering the power of speech . " It 's a lie that you 've cooked up from what you have heard from the neighbours . May their tongues rot out ! And if it were true as the sun , what is it to you ? She 's dead , I tell you ! She 's been dead these twenty years ! I had the papers telling of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . " " Quiet then , my uncle ! " said the Skipper , bending forward , and laying his hand on the old man 's knee . " She is dead , she died in these arms . I am her son , do you see ? " But if Mr. Scraper saw , it was only for a moment , for he gave a scream , and fell together sideways in his chair , struck with a fit . CHAPTER X. IN THE VALLEY OF DECISION . " And now , Colorado , son of my heart , " the Skipper said , " you understand why I was a thief that yesterday , and why I could not permit you at that instant to tell of my thieving ? " They had put the old man to bed , and Mr. Bill Hen had gone for the doctor . In fact , when John ran out of the door , he had found Mr. Bill Hen leaning up against it , as speechless , with amazement and confusion , as Mr. Scraper himself ! The good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Skipper and the boy , unbeknown to them , and posting himself in a convenient angle of the porch , had heard every word of the conversation . The Skipper , perceiving the facts , managed to rouse him with a few sharp words , and sent him off in hot haste to the village ; and had then proceeded to make the old gentleman comfortable , and to set things shipshape , so far as might be . " Do you think he will die ? " asked John , peeping over the bed at the sunken features of the old man . " I do not ! " was the reply . " I think this my revered uncle has yet many years to live -- and repent , if so he be minded . He is a very bad old man , Colorado , this my revered uncle ! Ah , thou ancient fish , thou art finally landed ! " " Are you sorry for a person when he is so bad as that ? " asked the boy , as he had asked once before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he tried very hard indeed ? " " I have no knowledge ! " said the Skipper , rather shortly . " I am a human person altogether , my son ! and I concern myself not greatly with the improvement of this my revered uncle . Behold it , the will , made by my grandfather , the father of my poor mother , whose soul , with his , rest in eternal glory ! By this , my mother , and I after her , inherit this house , this garden , these possessions such as they are . If I desire , son of mine , I may come here to-day to live , sell the ' Nautilus , ' or cut her cable and let her drift down the river , with Rento and Franci , and all the shells ; and I may live here in my house , to -- what do you say ? cultivate my lands , eat grass and give it to the cattle ? What think you , Colorado ? Is that a life ? Shall I lead it , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , of roving over the sea , with no place where I may rest , save the heaving ocean , that rests never beneath the foot ? Shall we turn out this old wicked man , who did to death his old father , who made my mother go sad of heart to her grave , who has done of all his life no kind act to any person -- shall we turn him out , and live in peace here , you and I ? " The child came near to him , and laid his hand on his friend 's knee , and looked up in his face with troubled eyes . " I am not very bright , " he said , " and you think so many things so quickly that I do not know what you mean a good deal of the time . But -- but Cousin Scraper took me when my people died , and he has taken care of me ever since , and -- and he has no one else to take care of him now . " " Yes , the fine care he has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of skin and bone , my child , and there are marks on your skin of blows , I saw them yesterday : cruel blows , given from a bad heart . You have worked for him , this ancient fish-skin , how long ? Of wages , how much has he paid you ? Tell me these things , and I will tell you how much it is your duty to stay by him . " But John shook his head , and the shadows deepened in his blue eyes . " You can not tell a person those things , " he said ; " a person has to tell himself those things . But thank you all the same , " he added , fervently ; " and I love you always more and more , every day and every minute , and I always shall . " " Now the question is , " said the Skipper , shrugging his shoulders in mock despair , " must I turn pirate in truth , to gain possession of a child whom I could hold in my pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head to go with me ? Go away , son of mine , that I reflect on these things , for you try my soul ! " John withdrew , very sad , and wondering how it was that right and wrong could ever get mixed . He thought of looking in some of the old books to see , but , somehow , books did not appeal to him just now . He went up to his own little room , and took down the china poodle , and had a long talk with him ; that was very consoling , and he felt better after it ; it was wonderful how it cleared the mind to talk a thing over with an old friend . The poodle said little , but his eyes were full of sympathy , and that was the main thing . By-and-by , as the child sat by his little window , polishing the pearl-shell on his sleeve , and thinking over the strange events of the last few days , there came to him from below the sound of voices . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ; and little as he felt inclined to merriment , John fell into a helpless laughter , as he recalled the look of that worthy man when he was discovered flattened against the door . How much older one grew sometimes in a short time ! Mr. Bill Hen used to look so old , so wise , and now he seemed no more than another boy , and perhaps rather a foolish boy . But seeing the Skipper made a great difference in a person 's life . Presently the door at the foot of the stairs opened , and John heard his name called ; he hastened down , and found Mr. Scraper sitting up in bed , looking pale and savage , but in full possession of his faculties . The doctor was there , a burly , kind-eyed man , and Mr. Bill Hen was there , and the Skipper ; and when little John entered , they all looked at him , and no one said anything for a moment . At length the doctor broke the silence . " I understand , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a paper , a will or the like , substantiating your claims ? " " I have ! " the Skipper replied . " The letter received by my mother , shortly before her death , was dictated by my grandfather , and told that , hearing for many years nothing from his son , this child 's grandfather , he had made a will in her favour . This , being timorous , he had not dared to show to anyone , neither to send her a copy , but he bade her send a messenger to make search in a certain cupboard of this house , on a certain shelf , where would be found this paper . My mother dying , commended to me this search . I at that time was a youth on adventures bent , with already plans for eastern voyages . Keeping always the letter in my pouch , and in my heart the desire of my mother , I came , nevertheless , not to this part of the world ; years come and go , Senor , swiftly with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of attraction than Borneo and other places where were easily to be found my wares . Briefly , I came not ; till this year , a commission from a collector of some extent brought the ' Nautilus ' to New York . And then , say I , how then if I go on , see this my inheritance , discover if it may profit me somewhat ? I come , I discover my revered uncle , unknown to him . Is the discovery such that I desire to fall on his respected bosom , crying , ' My uncle , soul of my family , behold your son ! ' I ask you , Senors both ! But I find this , my revered uncle , to be a collector of shells : thus he is in one way already dear to my heart . Again , I find here at the moment of my arrival a child , who is in effect of my own blood , who is to me a son from the moment of our first speech . Is it so , Colorado ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he nodded like a little mandarin , and the red curls fell into his eyes and hid the tears , so that no one but the Skipper saw them . " How then ? " the Skipper resumed , after a moment 's pause . " My soul not calling me to reveal myself to this so-dear relative , what do I ? I come to this house , without special plan , to spy out the land , do we say ? I find my uncle forth of the house ; I find my child travailing in the garden . Good ! The time appears to me accepted . I enter , I search , I find the cupboard , I find the paper . Briefly , Senors both , behold me possessor of this house , this garden , this domain royal . " He handed a paper to the doctor , who read it carefully , and nodded . Mr. Scraper made an attempt to clutch it in passing , but grasped the air only . " What then , in finality , do I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to stay in this place ? Wishing not to grieve the Senor Pike , whom greatly I esteem , I consider it unfit for the human being . Of property , I have little desire ; I have for my wants enough , I have my ' Nautilus , ' I have my boys , to what end should I retain these cold spots of earth , never before seen by me ? To what purpose , I ask it of you , Senors ? Therefore , in finality , I say to my revered uncle this : Give to me the child , give to me the boy , that I take away and make a sailor , for which he was born ; and I of my part surrender house and garden , even any money bags which may be , what know I , perhaps at this moment in the bed of my revered uncle concealed ? " The old man gave a convulsive shudder at this , and shrieked faintly ; all started , but the Skipper laughed . " You see , Senor Pike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how great sums this ancient fish has hidden under him ? Let him keep them , these sums . I take the child , and I go my way . Is it finished , uncle of my heart ? Is it finished , venerable iniquity ? Can you part with the child , beloved , even as your old father was beloved , and like him caressed and tenderly entreated ? Answer , thou ! " But before Mr. Scraper could speak , little John stepped forward , very pale , but clear in his mind . " If you please , " he said , " I should like to speak . If you please , he ( indicating the Skipper , ) is so kind , and -- and -- he knows what I -- he knows things I have thought about , but he does not know all . Cousin Scraper , you may be sick now , perhaps a long time , and perhaps you have gone upon your bed to die , like that king in the Bible who had figs put on ; only he got well . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do as well as I know how , and I think I can work more than I used to , because I know more , these last days , than I did , and -- and -- I think that is all . But if you do n't mind -- if you would try to like me a little , I think we should get on better ; and if dried figs would do , we might try those , you know . " Here he turned to the doctor , with a face of such clear brightness that the good man choked , and coughed , and finally went and looked out of the window , wondering whether he was laughing or crying . Then John came forward , and held out both hands to the old man with an appealing gesture . " Will you try to like me a little ? " he said ; and for the first time his voice quivered . " For now my only friend is going away , and I am sending him , and I shall never see him again . " Mr. Endymion Scraper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his mind at this moment . Gathering himself up in the bed , he pushed the boy away from him with all his feeble strength . " Go ' way ! " he said . " Go ' way , I tell ye . If that man there will take ye , he 's welcome to ye , I guess . If he 's fool enough to take ye in exchange for property , saying the property was his , which I ai nt fool enough to do without a lawyer -- he 's welcome to ye . I say , he 's welcome . I do n't want no brats round here . I took ye out of charity , and I 've had enough of ye . Go ' long , I say , with that wuthless feller , if he is my sister 's son . I want to be rid of the hull lot and passel of ye ! " His voice rose to a scream , and the veins on his narrow forehead stood out like cords . The doctor motioned to the Spaniard ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in his arms as he had done once before , swung him over his shoulder , and left the room . CHAPTER XI . SAILING . " Rento ! " " Ay , ay , sir ! " " Franci ! " " Senor ! " " Jack and Jim ! " The monkeys for answer leaped on their master 's shoulder , and chattered , and peered round into his face . " The company of this schooner , attention ! Behold Colorado , who comes to be my son ! He sails with us , he receives kindness from you all , he is in his home . Instruction you will give him in ways of the sea , and he becomes in all things your brother . Am I understood ? " The different members of the crew received this intelligence each in his own way . Rento advanced , and shaking John cordially by the hand , assured him with honest warmth that he was proper glad to see him , and that he hoped they should be good friends . Franci smiled like an angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made frightful grimaces at the boy , and threatened his life . But John was too happy to be afraid of Franci . Going boldly up to him , he asked ,  --  " Why do n't you like me , and why do you want to kill me ? I never did you any harm , and I should like to be friends , please . " The Spaniard looked at him sidelong out of his soft , sleepy eyes . " Have you understanding ? " he asked presently . " Have you intelligence to accept the idea of a person of poetry , of soul ? " " I think so ! " said John , with some confidence . " I could try , anyhow . " " Look , then ! " exclaimed Franci , throwing his arms abroad with a dramatic gesture . " I am not of nature murderous . A dove , a lamb at sport in the meadow , such is the heart of Franci . But -- behold me desolated on this infernal schooner . Torn by my parents from my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maidens , all enamoured of my person , I am sent to be a sailor . A life of horror , believe me who say it to you ! Wetness , cold and work ; work , cold and wetness ! Behold the sea ! may it be accursed , and dry up at the earliest moment ! I come here , on this so disastrous voyage . Have I poetry , think you , on board this vessel ? Is the pig-faced armadillo yonder a companion for me , for Franci ? Is my beauty , the gentleness and grace of my soul appreciated here ? even the Patron , a person in some ways of understanding , has for me only the treatment of a child , of a servant . Crushed to the ground by these afflictions , how do I revenge myself ? How do I make possible the passage of time in this wooden prison ? I make for myself the action , I make for myself the theatre . Born for the grace of life , deprived of it , let me have the horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a flea ; in appearance , I desire blood , blood , blood ! " He shrieked the last words aloud , and leaped upon the boy , his eyes glaring like a madman 's ; but John was on his own ground now ; his eyes shone with appreciation . " That 's splendid ! " he cried . " Blood ! Oh , I wish I could do it like that ! I say , we can play all kind of things , ca n't we ? We 'll be pirates -- only good pirates ,  - -  and we 'll scour the seas , and save all the shipwrecked people , wo n't we ? And you shall be the captain ( or you might call it admiral , if you liked the sound better , I often do ) , and I will be the mate , or the prisoners , or the drowning folks , just as you like . I love to play things . " " Come to my heart , angelic child ! " cried Franci , flinging out his arms once more . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found a comrade ! That I weep on thy bosom , Colorado ! " And , much to the disgust of Rento , he fell upon John 's neck , and shed , or appeared to shed , a few tears , with great parade of silk handkerchief . He then advanced to where the Skipper was smoking his cigar in the stern , and informed him , with a low bow , that he and Colorado were one soul , which the Skipper said he was delighted to hear , adding that he recommended the one soul to set the two bodies to work cleaning the brasses . Franci liked to clean the brasses , because he could see his face in them , and make eyes at himself as he went along ; accordingly he turned three back-somersaults , a sign of high good-humour with him , and returned to his new friend . " Have you noticed , Colorado , " he inquired , " the contour of my leg ? Did you observe it now , quivering in the air ? " John nodded appreciation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , " said the latter , gravely , " is a responsibility , my friend . It is a burden , my soul ! Franci has shed tears over it , the tears of a poet . You have read of Apollo , at least you have heard of him , the god of poetry , of music , of grace ? yes ? Behold him , Colorado ! He lives before you , in the form of Franci . Come on , that we clean together the brasses ! " As for the monkeys , they at once adopted John as their companion and their lawful prey . They climbed over him , they tried to get into his pockets , they nestled in his arms , they challenged him to races among the yards . The Skipper was their king , Franci was their model , the ideal toward which they vainly aspired . Rento , good , homely Rento , was the person who fed them , and with whom they could take any liberties , with no danger of a beating ; but the new-comer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dressed up , it was true , like men , but in no other way resembling them more than another , more than themselves . Let him come and play , then , and put on no airs . These were the sentiments of Jack and Jim , and John responded to them with hearty good-will . The Skipper sat smoking , and watched with a quiet smile the gambols of the three young creatures , as they sped here and there about the rigging , chattering , laughing , shrieking with glee . " Laugh , my son ! " he said to himself , between the puffs of his cigar . " Laugh and play , my little son ! Far too little laughter has been in thy life so far ; here thou shalt be as gay as the sun is bright on the Bahamas . Of what use to be a sailor , if not to rejoice , and to see with joy the works of God and His glory ? Laugh , Colorado , the sound is music in my ears ! " But by-and-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rento and Franci set to work in good earnest . The wind was fair , the tide was setting out . What should keep them longer here ? The sails were hoisted to the tune of " Baltimore , " and Rento 's gruff bass and Franci 's melting tenor were mingled for once in friendly harmony . " I wish I was in Baltimore ! lo ! A-skating on the sanded floor . A long time ago ! Forever and forever , lo ! Forever and forever , boys , A long time ago ! " Just as the cables were about to be cast off , a hail was heard from the wharf , and Mr. Bill Hen Pike appeared , purple and breathless . " Schooner ahoy ! " he gasped ; and then fell against a post and mopped his brow . " Senor ! " responded the Skipper , coming to the stern , and greeting his guest with a wave of the hand , " you come to bid us farewell ? It is kindly done ! Or you bring us , perhaps , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senor , the tide waits not ! " " I -- I brought this ! " said Mr. Bill Hen , holding up a small object . " I went up into his room , to see if there was anything he might like , and there war n't nothing but just this . I thought you 'd like to have it , Johnny , to take along with you . " The good man 's voice faltered ; John ran to the stern , and held out his hands eagerly , tenderly , crying ,  --  " Oh , thank you , dear Mr. Pike ! thank you so very , very much ! " For it was the china poodle that Mr. Bill Hen had brought . When the treasure was safe in the child 's hands , Mr. Bill Hen breathed more freely . " Now you 'll have something to remember us by , Johnny ! " he said . " We 've lotted on ye a good deal , here to the village ; more maybe than you thought on . I -- I 'll miss ye consid'able , off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll think about us nows and thens , wo n't ye , Bub ? " " Oh , yes , indeed ! " cried little John , eagerly . " I shall think of you a great , great deal , Mr. Bill Hen ! You have always been so good and kind to me , and I shall miss you , too , and Lena , and lots of people . And -- and how is Cousin Scraper , please , Mr. Bill Hen ? Does he miss me , do you think ? " " He 's all right ! " replied Mr. Bill Hen , gruffly . " Doos n't seem none the worse for his tantrum . No , if you ask me , I ca n't say as he seems to miss ye , not anyways to hurt him , that is . He 'll be out again to-morrow all right , doctor says ; and besides bein ' rather uglier than common all day , I do n't see no difference in him . " John sighed , but not very heavily . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said ; " but then , on the other hand , if he missed me , he would n't be so comfortable at my going away ; so , you see ! " Mr. Bill Hen did not see , but he said it was of no consequence . Then , coming to the edge of the wharf , he shook hands all round , never noticing , in the preoccupation of his mind , the knife that Franci flashed and brandished in his eyes as a parting dramatic effect . He held John 's hand long , and seemed to labour for words , but found none ; and so they slipped away and left him standing alone on the wharf , a forlorn figure . Down the river ! Sailing , sailing over the magical waters , past the fairy shores , already darkening into twilight shades of purple and gray . The white schooner glided along , passing , as she had come , like a dream . In the bow stood the Skipper , his eyes bent forward , his hand clasping fast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said . " We go , my son , to new worlds , to a new life . May a blessing be upon them , as my heart feels there will be . Behold , my friend , the ways of God , very wonderful to men of the sea . I come up this river , with what thoughts in my heart ? Partly of curiosity , that I see the place where my mother , long dead , was born , came to her womanhood ; partly of tenderness for her memory , regard for her wish ; partly , also , for anger at the villain brother , my uncle , and desire for revenge , for my rights . I come , and I find -- a child ! A brother for my present life , a son for my age , a friend for my heart ! Living upon the sea , Colorado , a man has much time for thought ; the sea speaks to him , the sky , the wind and wave . What is the word they say , each and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Glory to God ! ' That is it , my son . Let us give thanks , and begin with joy our new life together ! " Down the river ! The banks fade into shadow , the breeze sinks away , but still the tide flows free , and the schooner slips along like a spirit . Now comes up the white fog , the fog out of which she came gliding that first morning ; and it receives her as a bride , and folds her in its arms , and she melts into the whiteness and is gone . Was it all a dream ? Or does there still come back to us , faintly borne , sweetly ringing , the song of the sailors ? Music For-ev-er and for-ev-er I -- o , For-ev-er and for-ev-er boys , A long time a-go . Illustration The Hildegarde Series AND OTHER BOOKS BY LAURA E.
