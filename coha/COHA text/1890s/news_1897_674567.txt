txt The public is prepared to believe almost anything about the Klondike gold fields . The latest reports carry the probable production to date rather above $5,000,000 . What it will be after the thousands of miners now madly racing for the placers have staked out claims and begun to work them can only be conjectured . Already it is estimated that $50,000,000 will be taken in the Klondike s country during the coming year ; and in view of the remarkable outburst of the gold-mining fever in other States and in other countries the opinion is held that the world 's production of gold may reach 8300,000,000 in the year , it being now about *200,000,000 . The injection of $100,000,000 of minted gold into the currency of the world would ? have no perceptible effect on prices . It Would be only a slight inflation . But a sudden jump of 50 per cent . in the output of gold would have a tendency to depress the price of that metal . If it were a good deal depressed , the prices of commodities generally would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody . It would be easier for anybody to get an ounce of gold than it is now . This will not happen . The change in the price of gold will be so slight as to be a subject of practical discussion only in the operations of exchange or of the mints , where transactions are large and necessarily delicate . Gold fell in value . after the opening of the mines of California and Australia in the middle of this Century . But the percentage of increase in production was then vastly greater . From 1740 to 1840 the world 's average annual production of gold was only about $12,000.000 . From 1820 to 1830 it was only $94,000,000 for the -- dedade : - But from .1841 : to 1850 the average per year:rose to . $36,000,000 . The year 1S49 was the " argonaut " year of California , and gold was discovered in Australia only a little later . The average yearly output rose in 1851-5 to $132 , - 000,000 , an increase of more than - 1,000 per cent . over the average of thirty years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it diminished , to rise again in this decade to its present figures of $200,000,000 . The United States , which had produced only $939,085 worth of gold in 1847 and $10,000,000 the next year , produced $40 , - 000,000 in 1849 ; and from fifty to sixty millions yearly from 1850 to 1860 . Under the influence of this tremendous outpouring of gold the price of the metal , measured by day 's - work , declined , expressed proportionally in figures , from 1.105 - in 1849 to 1 in 1860 . Prices of commodities advanced , indicating a lower purchasing power in gold . The average prices of commodities , each being rated according - to its importance in consumption , rose from a level indicated by 83.5 in 1S49 to 105 in 1853 and 114 in 1857 . The influence of the new gold production is ' visible here , although other causes Were also operative . It Is not likely that we shall see these phenomena repeated . The bulk of the world 's transactions is now vastly larger . It takes a greater shock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph and rapid transportation tend to diffuse commercial energy and prevent abnormal manifestations in any one spot . Coffee would not be $30 a pound on the Klondike if the grocer could telegraph for a fresh supply at night and receive it in the morning . And the amount of gold in the world , eight billions or so , is too prodigious an ocean to be augmented to a disturbing degree by a pailful from the Klondike . Silver may ultimately rise in price , not because gold will drop toward the fanciful and vanished ratio of 16 to 1 , but because in the rush for the richer metal silver mining is likely to be neglected . If there is a materially lessened production and if Prance and the United States : do not unload their accumulated millions , the price ought to go up , even if the Indian mints remain closed , Bimetallism , however , will not make any progress on that account . The large increase in gold production will deal ? that unhappy cause a blow from which it may never recover   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
