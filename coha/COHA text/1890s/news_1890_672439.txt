txt It theNew-YorkSteath Company were engaged in a systematic effort to demonstrate how many different kinds of a public nuisance it could be at one and the same time , it could hardly accomplish more than it has done with no such object in view . Yesterday it ran afoulof the municipal authorities in the matter of opening the street pavements to got at its pipes and had all of its permits revoked . Thomas F. Gilroy , Commissioner of Pnblicr Works , was out of patience with the company yesterday . To a Trams reporter he said : " have no faith whatever in the statements made by the company . It has not kept faith with me in a single instance , and has constantly proceeded with its work in a spirit ' f contempt for the laws . I shall place no reliance whatever hereafter upon any of its assurances . Yesterday it made application for a permit to open the pavement in front of 42 Vesey Street for the purpose of making a house connection with the mains , and the inspector whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , if the connection could not be made without opening the - street  --  reported that the laborers were already digging the trench . Without waiting for the permit from this department the company went right ahead with its work in seeming defiance of the law , which requires it to get the consent of this department before opening the streets . " I immediately wrote to W. C. Andrews , President of the company , revoking all the permits heretofore issued to it , and I will not issut another permit to the company until I receive satisfactory assurances that it proposes to Con , form to the law . I have furthermore particularly requested the Police Department to have the policemen especially instructed to arrest any officer or employe of the company that trier to open any of the streets without a specialpermit from the department . I have had to call upon the police because I have no force of my ' own to see that the laws and ordinances are enforced . I have also invoked the aid of the Mayor in the matter . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case and calling upon him to assist me in upholding the authority of this department . If I could have my way about it I 'd have the chief officers of the company arrested and made to answer for this violation of the law . It 's well for them that so much power is n't lodged in a quick-tempered Individual like myself . " There is another serious cause of complaint against the company . Last Friday I issued a permit to the Steam Company to open Wall Street at Nassau to put in a stop valve in order to out off the steam from its Wall Street pipes . President Andrews assured me that the work would be begun right away and would be finished before Monday night . That is last Monday . Well , the work has not been done yet . At the same time I gave W. C. Humstone , the Sit= perintendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company , a permit to open Wall Street to relay its conduit . He found that the wires in the conduit had all been fused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went ahead promptly with his work , however , and completed it Monday , according to his promise . " The asphalt pavement in Wall Street has only been completed a short time , but its condition was such in seine places that I was compelled to call the attention of the Barber Asphalt Paving Company to it . Capt . T. V. Greene , the Vice President of the company , ' wrote me July 15 saying that the pavement was laid in the best possible manner and was in first-class order except over the steam pipe of the New-York Steam Company . Directly over the steam pipe and for the entire length of the pavement , a strip of the pavement from two to ten feet wide was disintegrated and ruined . What damage the heat had done to the concrete foundation upon which the asphalt pavement was laid could not be stated because no examination had yet been made . Capt . Greene said that the pavement would have to be relaid wherever it had been ruined by the heat from the pipes , and he declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per square yard for the asphalt pavement and $2 per square yard for the concrete if that should require relaying . But repairing or relaying the pavement would do no good if the steam company continued to use the mains from which the damage ensued . The pavement would not last  --  could not be made to fast  --  over such an intense heat as radiated from those pipes . " The steam company promised to shut off the steam from its Wall Street mains . Its President said that it had other means of supplying its Wall Street customers . He promised to have the alterations completed by last Monday : he has not begun on them yet To-day the company has begun its inspection of the sewers along the line of its mains over the same ground that the Board of Health went over two weeks ago . I have appointed Frank E. Towle , a civil engineer not connected with the department , to go along with them as an inspector , and have instructed him to see that when the temperature of the sewers is taken it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhole with the cover off , but down some distance in the manhole and with the cover on , where the steam pipes got in their work , and where the upper atmosphere does not get at them to cool them . " But little public attentiou is attracted to the company except by the occasional bursting of is mains , such as occurred several times recently at Fulton Street and Broadway . But the damage wrought by even the most serious of these explosions is trivial compared with the silent but continual injury that the heat from the pipes is doing to the foundations of buildings along the lines of pipe and to the sewers and electric conduits and subways which parallel and intersect them . The effect of the heat was shown most plainly at the last explosion , when the basement of the building at Broadway and Fulton Street was plastered nearly two inches thick with fine , flour-like dust . That dust was blown through the basement walls of the building . The thing could never have happened if the cement in the foundation walls had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the soil of the street for several feeraround the pipes had not also been disintegrated and made as fine as flour . Similar mischief is being worked with the sewer pipes and mains . The intense heat . even - without the influence of the escaping steam , is sufficient to destroy the tenacity of cement and plaster , thus weakening the joints and destroying the masonry . Commissioner Gilroy gave it as his unqualified conviction that the only way , in which the interminable nuisance of opening the pavements every time repairs were made necessary to any of the pipes or conduits in the streets could be avoided was by the construction of a tunnel under the main thoroughfares , which should contain all the sub-surface works of all kinds , and afford sufficient space for access to them for repairs and connections or alterations without tearing up the pavement . Such a tunnel , he said , ought to be built under Broadway before the Broadway Railroad cable is put in , and before the new pavement is laid . But before such a work could be done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also authorize the issuance of bonds by thin city to pay for it .
