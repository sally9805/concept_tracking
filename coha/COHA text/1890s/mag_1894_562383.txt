txt CIVILIZATION from its very nature and definition is better than barbarism , and yet there are , certain things in barbarism that one longs for on certain occasions . Republicanism is better than Democracy for the very same reason , and yet in the same manner it is a temptation to yearn s6metimes for some of the weapons which Democracy uses and which we never seem able to employ . When the Republicans in 1890 , with a Committee on Elections composed of the best lawyers and most judicious men of the House , passed upon sixteen cases of disputed elections and recorded their judgments , which were ratified by the House , finding their opponents right in seven cases , seating neither of the combatants in one and giving eight seats to their own side , the air was filled with outcries and the Democratic newspapers were double-leaded and headlined with indignation . In the present Congress the Democratic committee has already unseated three members out of a possible four with an unparalleled disregard of law and justice , and the silent air has reverberated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , and in the House the events are forgotten in a day . Those who do not forget them rather long for some such barbaric sounds as our enemies used to set up upon occasions when they had small right to utter any reproachful language whatever . So in the endeavor to run the House of Representatives without adopting the rules of the 51st Congress , every principle of parliamentary law was overridden , and it was decided that business could be done before the journal was read ; that a committee could re // s9* port business that was never referred to it ; that a sergeant-atarms could hold an order of arrest over members of the House for ten days with power to execute it at his pleasure without any control of the House ; that a motion to recommit a special rule was good when made by a Democrat , and bad when made by a Republican ; and that motions not dilatory could be ruled out under a provision which related only to dilatory motions and many similar performances . When all these things and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no proper public condemnation was put upon them , especially as they are likely to become landmarks of oppression hereafter . However , the causes of public apathy are simple , and on the surface . All things are relative , and the greatness of other events has entirely dwarfed these minor affairs ; yet , in the long run , some of these minor affairs may prove troublesome to other generations . Some day , also , this country will awake to the very unhandsome treatment which contested election cases receive , and adopt some system by which justice will be done so that the scandals attached to election cases may disappear . Of those greater events which have so commanded public attention it is difficult to adequately speak , and yet according to all law , human and divine , there is a perfect case against the Democratic pary . We not only have " a confessing accused , " but one who has acted under no duress except that of his own conscience and whose confession has not only been full and complete as to the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President and Senators , members and committeemen , have vied with each other in language about each other which exceeds in warmth and unkindness anything which even partisan prophecy has ever uttered . And the proofs of the correctness of these statements are so abundant that it seems useless to say another word as to the past . One of our institutions has certainly received a great shock That this shock is but temporary no good patriot can doubt , and yet it ought to be commented upon , if only for the light which it throws upon the capacity of the Democratic party to govern , which is , after all , the ultimate question now before the people . Until this last Congress , whatever might be thought of individual members , the Senate as a body has always been reputed dignified , upright , and honorable . It has always commanded // the respect of the people as the great conservative legislative branch . Never until this time has it been subject to universal reproach . When before in the history of this country has the Executive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly charged the Senate with perfidy and treachery ? It is certainly a strange spectacle , this conflict between the President and a Senate nuder control of his own party . And yet outside the sugar question , for which the President did not reproach them , what had they done except to look out for the interests of their constituents ? Has there ever been any reply to Senator Gorman 's declaration made in open Senate , that what the Senate did was but the redemption of pledges given during the election by the party managers , and which were absolutely necessary to enable the country to be carried ? Senator Gorman 's revelations as to sugar and the promises he gave to its friends were only samples of revelations he might have made , and samples of other promises he and his associates had given . Nor were these promises all secret . The hustings in Connecticut , New York , and New Jersey rang with assurances that no harm should be done to the industries of the country . When , therefore , the so-called conservatives among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their constituents from the ravages of the South , why was that any more treachery and perfidy than the refusal of Mr. Wilson to draft and pass a bill for revenue only ? When the platform demanded the extinction of all protection , why was it perfidy to favor protection on the general taxation plan instead of on the free raw material plan ? Both coddled the manufacturers and both taxed the people . Why was either of them Democratic when both of them gave the lie direct to the platform ? The only moral anybody can draw from this dispute is that whatever Democratic principles may hereafter be discovered to be they were certainly not put into the platform . It was because of the profound faith of our people that the Democratic party did not mean what it said , that we are in this predicament . But when a man does not mean what he says you can never tell what he does mean , except in the sorrowful way in which we are now learning the meaning of the Democratic platform . The truth is that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic principles are is the key to our unfortunate situation . Individual Democrats have principles , but // the party has none . Mr. Wilson was so sure that the sugar part of the tariff was all wrong that he hoped at one time that Congress would never adjourn until the sugar tax was trampled under foot , and yet he himself led that frightful tumbling over each other with which the majority House fixed upon us the very tax he was denouncing . Mr. Wilson on that first occasion did not represent his party , for the very letter of the President which he caused to be read was exceedingly tolerant of sugar , and sorrowed only over protected coal and protected iron ore . The whole Democratic party except Hill-if it could be called a Democratic party without Hill-in the Senate finds Democratic principle in taxed and monopolized sugar and taxed coal and taxed iron . Free raw material is Democratic principle in the White House , while taxed coal and iron pass muster in the Senate even after the presidential round-up and while Senators are yet quivering under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing both houses agreed upon , which seems therefore to come nearer being a Democratic principle than anything else , has its maligners inside the party , and the President , forgetting that he advised it in a message , has plaintive regrets that it is part of the act . It is just this discordant condition of things existing upon every subject to be legislated on which is the cause of this utter failure and collapse of the Democratic party as a governing party . All this arises really from the very nature of things . The President is not abusing the Senate , and accusing his party associates of perfidy and dishonor , of " communism of pelf , " or of the other naughty things they have done , simply to amuse the public . The public is amused , but that is not his purpose . Not at all . He abuses them just as aforetime he abused the Republican party , because he does not agree with them any more than he did with us . The Senators did not charge that the President had duped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to furnish an exhibition of party discord . They believed what they said , and the discord existed . Each party , believing the other totally wrong , was chafed by the common inability to act together or to act at all . We ought therefore in our reproaches to hit the right mark  --  the party , not the individuals . Why all this senseless abuse of each other by individual Democrats ? It is not the individual Democrat who is wrong ; it is the combination . // How can those who do not think alike act together ? What possible bond of united action can there be between Mr. Smith , who represents the manufacturing State of New Jersey , the industrial life of which is bound up in its workshops and mills , and a representative from a Southern State , permeated with the traditions of McDuffie and Free Trade ? How can Senator Gorman , who knows so thoroughly and practically the industries of West Virginia , agree with Mr. Wilson . who is learned only in the wisdom of the Englishman ? It very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad in combination . It has been often demonstrated that individual Democrats are very good men , indeed it is almost too simple a fact of every-day observation to be even stated ; and yet the last year and a half shows that a combination of them makes a very unsatisfactory party . It is so elsewhere in nature . The ox is a most valuable animal , and so is the mule ; but yoked up together they make a most incongruous team , neither speedy of foot , beautiful to the eye , nor restful to the mind ; nevertheless either is a hard-working , reputable animal made for better things . We ought to frown upon all this use of hard language as to individuals . It is not seemly . Besides this , it obscures the real issue . Suppose the President does feel bad because of coal and iron , is that any reason why he should attack Senator Gorman , who feels well about it ? If Mr. Wilson 's scheme for a tariff has gone to water , is that any reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ? Only a few years ago he was clamoring for protection to coal , himself . Why not give the erring brother time to repent , as he also has repented ? Besides being unseemly , savoring , as it were , of those " selfish feelings " which the President assured us were to be banished from the millennial world he inaugurated , March 4 , 1893 , these bickerings obscure the real issue , which issue is : Has the Democratic party those qualities which fit it to govern this country at this time ? Let us not get ourselves lost in these little minor issues as to the relative blackness of pot and kettle . We might assume that both were black and very smutty if it were not for the dictates of politeness , which forbid people to be disagreeable to each other . We have had this country under the government of that party // for a year and a half , and what has been the result * I am not going to tell . There is such an embarrassment of riches that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of finance from the point of view of the relation between the income and the expenditures of the country , and find as great expenditures as when the country was at the height of its prosperity , you see that even the one virtue the Democracy have striven to adorn by their example does not abide with them , and that as economists they have attained failure so great that it would be conspicuous had there not been worse failures everywhere else . If one wished to comment on the tariff performance there is absolutely no room left . After the President and Gorman and Wilson had lapsed into longed-for silence , there was not left in stock any expressions of reproach and contempt . The entire list had been exhausted . When your enemies have said about themselves all the severe things that could be said , attempts at characterization would be but gleaning in a field swept by conflagration and storm . Nevertheless , while the particulars of this recrimination have ceased to be endurable , the fact of its existence is of the utmost importance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two years . One important , nay , one indispensable prerequisite , for the good government of this country by a party in power must be that that party shall be agreed within itself . If it is agreed , then you know what it will do . If it be discordant and belligerent , what it will do nobody can tell . We can not reasonably hope that the harvest may chance to be of wheat or some other grain . Rather is it likely to be tares which need to be burned with unquenchable fire ; for the Devil of Discord seldom sows anything else . Nor can we hope that such a party will continue to do nothing , or , to speak more exactly , to rest on the bad things they have already done . To put the proposition in the alternative form : Either the Democratic party are agreed as to their future conduct , or they are not . If they are not , then we must , if we continue them in power , take another leap in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so badly shaken up as they are we are not likely to take another . If , on the other hand , the Democracy are agreed as to the future , notwithstanding their inability to agree as to the past , // what is that agreement ? What is to be the course of these erratic comets in the future ? Surely the evidence on this point is abundant . Nobody can doubt or be at a loss . The President is a leader . Mr. Wilson is a leader . Mr. Mills is a leader , and so , also , are Mr. Cockran and Mr. Tom Johnson leaders . They have differed in the past . Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mills and Mr. President have been ahead of Mr. Gorman and Mr. Brice in the grand march of " tariff reform , " but Mr. Cockran and Mr. Tom Johnson have been away ahead of Wilson and Mills , and have not had qualms of " delicacy " over the sugar question like the President . How are they to be in the future ? Here , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that at the moment when he is trying to galvanize business into life by his editorials it is most cruel and unpatriotic to say anything which tends to depress affairs and discourage the tendencies of the times . Well , what is there which has a tendency to discourage business and dishearten the country ? There is only one answer ; the thing which hangs like a pall today over business is the speechmaking and letter-writing of Democratic leaders . When Mr. Wilson , in the House , amid applause and cheers on the Democratic side , openly avows his determination to continue the tariff fight " so long as the yoke of monopoly is on the neck of any citizen of this country " ; when Mr. Mills , in the Senate , declares that " we ' will " sweep the streets of the enemy " and " take everything from him " ; and when the President declares that this bad bill is only a vantage-ground for new attacks ; and when Mr. Wilson hurries home to assure his constituency that he has lost none of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 's until all the " strongholds of privilege " shall disappear ; - when , I say , all these men unite , amid the applause of their followers , in such expressions , and continue to reiterate them , the Democratic editor labors in vain . Business can not revive on such terms . Of course , business must move somewhat , the prostrate form must stagger to its feet , because suspended animation long continued is death , and we are not going to die . There is not stupidity enough in this nation to kill it . But until we are assured that the hands of these destroyers are stricken down , until this country knows that these leaders are bound over to keep the peace , there can be no revival of busi // ness which will do more than sparsely fill the empty shelves of our retail stores . Prosperity does not perch upon uncertainty . Even if the Gorman-Brice bill be as beautiful as its authors think it is , even if it be deserving of that lofty praise bestowed by its enemies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ripen fruit as long as these noisy boys are shaking and clubbing the tree . We can have no prosperity , even if the optimists are right , until the silver of these orators ' silence and the gold of their speech have been brought to the parity of zero . How shall this be done ? What is the duty of the voter who wants peace and a chance to look about him and see what a new world he is living in , and whether therein be lodging and breakfast ? What is the duty of the workingman who has been promised higher wages and more employment , and wants a chance to look about him and see if it is all there ? What is the duty of the farmer who was promised the " markets of the world " and wheat at a dollar and a quarter , and who fears that his ears may have deceived him , and that the word of promise has not even been kept to the ear , let alone the hope ? What shall these and all other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather a business question . Is there any aspect of it where it seems to be a good thing to keep up agitation to " sweep** somebody " off the streets and take everything from him " ? Is this a time to be hunting for " vantage-grounds " for another period of uncertainty and financial devastation ? Do we want to be ranting about " strongholds of privilege " by the mouths of the very men who have just voted twenty-two millions to the sugar trust , and are hoarse with wrath because they could not do the same for the coal trust ? Are we so in love , in a word , with the last year and a half that we want the next two years to be just like them ? Do we want any more of that juggling with words which votes for sugar trusts and weeps over coal trusts and calls little woolen mills and all the little hives of Northern industry-except those that make collars and cuffs- " strongholds of privilege , " " yokes of monopoly , " " class distinctions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths of men who think epithets are ideas ? There are three classes of people , at least , who will not be guilty of any blunders of that sort . The Republicans , who believe in protection , are not going to allow , if they can help it , // what has already gone too far to go farther in the wrong direction . It is true that so long as Mr. Cleveland is President we can do nothing affirmatively . He wants to be worse than his party have acted . But we can help , by electing a Republican House , to give this nation sorely pressed a breathing-space , even if the breathing-space is not of our choosing . There is another class , without distinction of party , who will look at this situation from a business point of view alone . They will say : We want to know the working conditions of this bill ; we can never know them if they are disturbed by factional fights between President and Senate , between divisions of the House , which threaten we know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some peace ; and the best way to shut these open and warring mouths , and stop these bickering pens , which are more valiant in vaunting than in veto , is to give Mr. Wilson a chance to lead a minority , and the President a Republican House , so that he can comment on a Democratic Senate to sympathizing people when next he is so inclined . Last , and not least , is a class of citizens who have always voted the Democratic ticket , and who feel a sense of personal mortification and sorrow because the party which has had the devotion of their like has proved so unworthy of it . Among them will be some of those who think with sadness how twice in their day and generation they have been led far afield by their Southern connections , who by sheer force of numbers and unmindful of interests of their party friends , have forced them into false positions and unhappy situations . To either of these classes of voters the pathway of duty is as clear as a shining light , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the people that hope which is the forerunner of wise action in the future , that confidence which will help rebuild our shattered fortunes . At this moment it is hard to see how the bright days before the second reign of Grover Cleveland can be renewed until the same or wiser conditions are re-established . The great motive power of our progress in civilization and comfort is the wide distribution of the wealth of the country which is the result of keeping all our people employed . This it is which constitutes the purchasing power of this country , which has made the mill wheels turn and set the factory machinery in motion . No foreign commerce can make up for that ; for whatever we cannot inai*e // because it is made abroad pays no wages to our workmen , to our managers and superintendents , and furnishes no profits with which our millowners and factory companies can extend their plant and employ the builder and his host of employees . When one mill in my district diminishes its payroll 40 per cent. , and pays its people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than #168 for each  --  and that instance is multiplied by thousands-we are no longer taking the strides toward comfort , happiness , and civilization which we had been taking for the thirty years before the fatal mistake of 1892 . Nevertheless we shall survive all this , and Lhe lesson for which we have paid such a terrible price will be a lesson never to be forgotten while this generation lingers on the shores of Time.
