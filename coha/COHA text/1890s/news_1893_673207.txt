txt The result in Rhode Island emphasizes once more the absurdity of requiring an absolute majority vote for the election of candidates for public office . With a small minority voting a third-party ticket , the result is that ' none of the candidates for State offices are elected by the people at all , and there is no assurance that those receiving the largest number of votes will be chosen in the end . The majority rule holding with regard to candidates for the Legislature also , the composition of that body is loft in doubt until a number of " by-elections " shall have been held in districts where no candidate received votes enough to be elected on Wednesday . There is absolutely no argument for the continuance of a plan of election which results in no Legislature until a few members finally elected by pluralities can complete it , and no election of State officers until the Legislature so completed shall decide according to the party preponderance in its own membership which of the candidates that fell short of a majority of the popular vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , shall be installed in office . It does not matter which party may finally get the advantage , the system is out of harmony with the general principles of popular government in this country and ought to be reformed . There is nothing to be said for it , and it sometimes plays serious mischief with important public interests , as it did in Connecticut two years ago . It is about time for Rhode Island and Connecticut to get free from the vestiges of old colonial charters and put their Constitutions on the modern basis of equality of representation and the decision of popular elections by the voice of the greater number .
