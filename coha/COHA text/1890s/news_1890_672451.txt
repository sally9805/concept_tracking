txt What a farce it is ? this pretense on the part of Republican Senators and Representatives and certain prominent Republican journals that they are opposed to Trusts and are in favor of a reduction of all tariff duties on which the protected Trusts live ! In the Senate yesterday , when the paragraph in the Tariff bill relating to white lead was reached , there was a solid Republican vote against any reduction of the duty as fixed . in the bill . The present duty , 3 cents a pound , is substantially prohibitory , being equivalent to an ad valorem rate of more than 70 per cent . Only $55,000 worth of white lead was imported last year to compete with the product of a Trust whose certificate capital is about $90,000,000 . The duty was retained by Mr. MCKLNLEY and . his associates , with the approval of Mr. Julius C. Bunitows of Michigan , who gave notice before the committee began its work that in his opinion the products of Trusts ought to go on the free list . It was retained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHERMAN , whose denunciations of Trusts have been frequent and emphatic . It has now been retained by the Republican majority of the Senate . The duty is , a we have said , about 70 per cent , of the selling price of English white lead , and under the shelter of it competition as to prices in the protected home market has been suppressed by the completion of a Trust . There has been no attempt to conceal the existence of this organization , whose name is The National Lead Trust ; hundreds of thousands of its share certificates have been bought and sold at the New-York Stock Exchange , just as those of the Sugar Trust are bought and sold there . But this Trust is a more comprehensive ring than the Sugar Trust , for while the Sugar Trust , if estimates be based upon the weekly product , at this time openly controls not more than 70 per cent . of the refining industry , the Lead Trust includes every white lead factory of any prominence in this country . Some time ago it controlled 97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by this time it may have acquired the remainder . The certificate capital is about $90,000 , - 000 , or nearly twice as large as that of the Sugar Trust . Most of the properties are represented in this capital by values inflated four for one or five for one . Mr. MCPHERSON spoke yesterday of one factory that could be replaced for $200,000 and that was sold to the Trust for $1,000,000 . The seller of it had explained to him that the Trust intended to raise the price of white lead and thus to pay dividends on all this water out of the money extorted from the people who are prevented from buying foreign white lead by a tariff wall 70 per cent . high . No one on the Republican side offered any explanation of the committee's-retention of the ring 's duty , and . the press report indicates that even Mr. PLUMB voted to keep up the Trust 's tariff wall . JOHN SHERMAN was one of the six members of the Finance Committee who decided . that this duty should be retained , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in such cases the duties ought to be reduced . He began with these words , in the Senate , two years and . a half ago : " When combinations to prevent a reduction of price by ' FAIT ' competition exist , I agree that they may and ought to be met by a reduction of duties . " Here is another forcible expression of opinion from Mr. SHERMAN , given to the public last October : " The primary object of a protective tariff is to invite the fullest competition by individuals and corporations in domestic production . If such individuals or corporations combine to advance the price of the domestic produot and to prevent the free result of open and fair competition , I would , without a moment 's hesitation , reduce the duties on foreign goods competing with them , in order to break down the combination. - ' Whenever free competition is evaded or avoided by combinations of individuals or corporations , the duty should be reduced and foreign competition promptly invited . " And Mr. SHERMAN was the author of the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , that appears to be of no value whatever  --  and , during the debate on that measure he exhausted his vocabulary in assaults upon Trusts . How would he describe and characterize such a course with respect to this matter if he were required to express his opinion concerning another man who had done just what he has done I And there is Mr. *Timms C. Bunnows  --  dons he think that ho does not deserve the hearty contempt of all straightforward and honest men ? Almost all of the leading Republican journals are not less guilty than Mr. SHERMAN . They have repeatedly urged that the duties used by the Lead Trust and other protected Trusts should be reduced . Some of them , like the St. Louis Globe-Democrat , have demanded that such duties should , be removed altogether : The Tribune , in this city , has pointed out again and again that such Trusts deserved no mercy at the hands of protectionists , but should be punished by a revision of duties . Still , when the bill - was reported , with all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Republican organs hailed it as a triumph of statesmanship , and there has since been scarcely a peep in any of them about the duties designed to help the " combines . " Almost without exception , we presume , they would vote , like Senator SEEnuAN and Representative Buiutows , to help the very Trusts they have denounced . so many times and to assist these combinations in suppressing that competition for the freedom of which they have repeatedly made appeal . There is nothing more contemptible in the history of tariff legislation than the inconsistency of prominent men and journals with respect to this question .
