txt That everybody speaks of Frederick Douglass as " Fred " Douglass is in itself an illustration of the unique position he occupied in our political life . It is noteworthy that he himself always resented the nickname , and this resentment was a punctilio that showed that he knew what it meant . It was , in truth , a sign of the patronage of the white race for a man of color who had done remarkably well , " considering . " It was a mark of the prejudice against which it is equally futile to argue and to pass statutes . Senator Sumner thought that the civil rights law would do something to dispel what he used to call the " accursed spirit of caste , " but it did nothing , for the reason that this spirit is entirely beyond the province of legislation . It is quite impossible to compel a man to associate with people with whom , for any good or bad reason , he does not choose to associate , and the very great majority of white men in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal terms , even if the men of color be their fellow-cadets at West Point or their fellow-members of the House of Representatives or the Senate . If Mr. Douglass had been a white man nobody would have thought of describing by a diminutive a personage of such conscious dignity of bearing and of so little disposition to familiarity . His resentment was quite natural , for the nickname denoted the prejudice which he had to meet andowhich made him , as ? we say , a figure quite unique . There have been men of color who attained higher offices than Fred Douglass . At least one has been a Senator of the United States , and at a time when the Senate was a much more reputable body than it is now . But for quite half a century he was recognized as the representative man of his race , the man who would be named first by whoever might have been called upon to designate the most distinguished men of color in the country . Perhaps he owed this distinction in part to his very impressive personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of mixed blood who have become conspicuous , he bore the unmistakable evidence of African descent in his appearance . He might indeed have been taken for a fullblooded African , of a type which is very seldom reached . But the qualities by which he attained celebrity were such as no full-blooded African in our- history has displayed in the same degree . He was ambitious , industrious , and Provident , and by the fnanifestation of these qualities he drew apart from his race and was not really a representative " Afe3-American . " It was not surprising to learn that he was not altogether persona . grata when he was appointed Minister to Haiti , although his appointment may have seemed to those who made it a stroke of policy . It is well known that the full-blooded blacks in Haiti are opposed to the men of mixed race , of whom Douglass was one , and the Haitian rulers . were disposed to resent the appointment that was expected to please them . In fact , a man like Douglass is in a painful and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the inferior race froth Which he derives part of his ancestry is credited by the whites to his white blood , and indeed there is no conspicuoUs instance of such steps being taken by a full-blooded African . By taking them he separates himself from his own people , " as both whites and blacks consider the blacks to be , and he is at home nowhere . It is significant that the blacks should generally have regarded his espousal of a white woman for nis second wife as an act of " treason , " though indeed it was the natural consequence of his own development . He was a man of integrity , of intelligence , of dignity , of benevolence . But these qualities , instead of solving the " race question . " in his case simply served to propound that question more sharply . They made it appear that a man who differed from his race for the better was isolated and made unhappy by the difference , ' without being enabled to effect anything for the benefit of his race .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
