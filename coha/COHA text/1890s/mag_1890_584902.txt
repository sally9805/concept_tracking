txt E have now to consider the section of English North America which lies to the west of the Mississippi River , a region where the under-structure , the topography , and , to a great extent , the physiographic conditions which affect the advance of man , are determined by the Cordilleran system of mountains . First , let us note the fact that this western section of the continent , at least the part of it which is south of the Canadian region , is generally characterized by a scanty rainfall . Only on the Pacific coast , north of California , do we find anything liI*e the annual share of moisture which comes to the earth in the regions east of the Mississippi . East of the Mississippi the aunual supply of rain amounts on the average to about fifty inches , a share of precipitation probably unsurpassed in any equally extensive area in the same latitude , unless it be in China . Moreover , the seasonal distribution of rain in the part of North America east of the Mississippi is , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the annual fall , it is true , takes pla*e in the winter half of the year , when it is of the least value to vegetation ; still almost all the territory is entitled by the regimen of the air to receive abundant showers during the growing season . West of the Mississippi the average rainfall , though not yet well determined , probably does not exceed twenty inches , and may in the end prove even less in quantity . Moreover , in this section the rain is ill distributed ; nearly the whole falls in the time between the first of January and the first of May , the summer and autumn being , in a large part of the area , times of continued drought . From the Mississippi River westward this diminution of the rainfall goes on rapidly as we approach the Rocky Mountains . The most arid section lies within the mountainous belt ; on the western borders of that district we have a narrow strip of country extending from southern California , widening to the north , wherein the rainfall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain districts local circumstances cause the rainfall to vary greatly in amount . There are considerable territories tolerably well provided with rain , but , as a whole , the region is arid . The trans-Mississippian portion of North America is , from the point of view of economic interests , divided into several distinct sections . On the east we have a strip of country including eastern Nebraska , Iowa , Missouri , eastern Kansas , Arkansas , and eastern Texas . In this section the annual rainfall is sufficient to promote the development of grain and the other staples appropriate to the soil and temperature . Throughout this belt the surface is , except in the Ozark district of Arkansas and Missouri , substantially unaffected by mountain-build ing forces . The whole of the area affords excellent soils . This section is in the main fitted for agriculture . There are , however , at several points , as in the lead district of Iowa , the lead and zinc country of Missouri , the iron district of the Ozark , considerable sources of mineral wealth . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of its line , the cimatal conditions are apparently favorable to the development of our race ; though the summers are , in the southern section of this district , extremely hot , the winter is sharp enough to maintain the physical energy of the people . West of the country just considered , and thence to the eastern boundary of the Cordilleras , we have a section where the diminished rainfall renders ordinary agriculture unprofitable . Now and then // a season favors the tillage of grain over the most of this vast expanse ; but the annual supply of water varies too much to make agriculture trustworthy . Along the streams irrigation is possible , and a small portion of the land may be made fertile by this expedient . Still , after all such engineering works are constructed , at least nine-tenths of the surface will remain unsuited to ordinary husbandry . Its only use will be for the pasturage of herds . A great portion of this Cordilleran Piedmont district is destitute of mountain ranges . The Black Hills form a curious outlier on the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the field . The result is that no important mineral resources are revealed in this country , except in the detached mountain mass of the Black Hills . The facts above stated make it plain that this great section of the continent has a limited future , save by a change of climate which it is unreasonable to expect , and we fail to see , how it can ever be made to afford a dwelling-place for large bodies of people . The absence of fuel , of timber , and water powers excludes manufactures . The dryness renders extensive agriculture impossible , and there remains only the chance of the scanty industry which comes with a pastoral life . North of the above-described section , within the limits of Canada , and in the drainage area where the waters flow the north pole toward , we have a large territory in the Saskatchewan , the Red River , and the other valleys , including an area of about 150,000 square miles , where the rainfall is considerably greater than it is in the Piedmont district of the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country is more diversified ; it contains a great many lakes ; the larger rainfall is marked by the greater number and size of the rivers , and there is a brief season of growth in which the smaller grains and root-crops prosper exceedingly . Although the surface of the country is generally level , the rocks are sufficiently disturbed to reveal a considerable amount of mineral resources , the value of which is not yet known . There is no question that this Hudson Bay area , as we may term it because its waters drain into that basin , is in many ways , of agricultural importance . As before remarked , it is exceedingly well fitted for the growth of certain staples , viz. , the smaller grains . Unfortunately , the region is too far north for the extensive growth of Indian corn . Moreover , the length and severity of the winters make it too cold to profit by the rearing of horned cattle or of sheep . At present the cultivation of small grains secures this section a fair measure of prosperity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a temporary success , for the reason that all the wheat fields in the central part of the continent are prone to rapid exhaustion from the rude tillage to which they are subjected . When the primary fertility of the ground is exhausted , it is necessary to have recourse to mixed farming , to artificial fertilizers , and other expedients which are not likely to prove profitable in this high northern realm , where the population must mainly depend on one class of crops . As far as the matter of climate is concerned , this region appears suitable to the people derived from the more northern countries in Europe . Scotch , English , North Germans , and Scandinavians appear to be well accommodated by their bodily habits to the rigors of the climate . There remains , however , the fact , that for nearly one-half the year work in the fields of this district is impossible , and this with a purely agricultural country is a grave economic disadvantage . Therefore , despite the present success of this high northern settlement , it seems likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second order , in which , though the population may maintain itself and attain to a certain diversity , the fullest development of life will not be secured because of the unvaried nature of the industries . We turn next to the territories contained within the vast area of the Rocky Mountains , extending from the Western pastoral lands to the border district , which lies upon the Pacific Ocean . For nearly two and a half centuries after the advent of the English settlers upon our shores the Cordilleran region remained a practically impassable barrier between // the settlements of the Atlantic coast and Mississippi Valley and the western sea . For two hundred years of this period the idea that this great natural barrier to commerce would ever be broken down does not seem to have entered into the minds of our people . Even after California was settled and the prospective importance of the group of States on the Pacific coast became evident , few dared to hope that the great American desert and the mysterious mountains which lay beyond it would ever be made as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swift advance of man 's control over terrestrial conditions within the lifetime of our generation as the speed with which these barriers have been overcome . The journey from New York or Boston to San Francisco is to us a much less serious undertaking than it was to our fathers to go from the sea-coast to the Ohio Valley . In northern Mexico , and thence northward to the farthest point where the Cordilleras have been explored , the Cordilleran mountain district has an average width of about one thousand miles . The topography of this region differs considerably from that of most other important mountain ranges . In the first place , the mountains proper rest upon an elevated pedestal , so that the greater valleys and inclosed table-lands often have a height of six or eight thousand feet above the level of the sea . This feature causes the climate of the region to be generally more rigorous than its latitude alone would cause it to be . The form of the mountains gives a curious type to the topography . The predominant ranges extend in a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appalachian system ; but in the Rocky Mountains we have a feature unobserved in the Appalachian elevations , in that there are many subordinate ranges having a general east and west course . The consequence is that the Cordilleran district contains many extensive elevated valleys , great surfaces sometimes of tolerably level floors of many thousand square miles in extent . Striking examples of these inclosed areas are found in the well-known parks of Colorado . In the last glacial period , when the rainfall of this country was far greater than at present , this range of mountains was by its condition calculated to afford a great number of isolated areas having a high order of fertility , as is shown by the fact that it had great lakes in many of its basins , water areas rivalling the Laurentian fresh-water seas in extent . The Rocky Mountains were probably at that time a verdant country , and would have been wonderfully well suited to the uses of man . At present , however , no considerable portion of this region is fitted for agriculture , save where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain section consists of mountainous peaks , probably nearly one-third the total area is well covered by soil which , owing to the fact that its resources have not been drained by vegetation , is of exceeding fertility . The researches of the United States Geological Survey have made it plain that over a hundred thousand square miles of this Cordilleran area can be won to tillage by storing the winter rains in convenient reservoirs and using the husbanded waters for irrigation . The Mormons have proved in a remarkable way the success which attends the application of water to the soil , and there is every reason to believe that in all the imp ? ortant valleys of this country there will be extensive areas of land in this way won to agriculture . The irrigated lands of the Rocky Mountains have a very great fertility , and are singularly enduring to tillage . We may fairly assume the arable value of these redeemable soils as at least three times as great as that afforded by the State of Illinois . Owing to the great north and south range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of climate , so that the products of the artificially watered fields may have a great diversity . Thus in Montana and Idaho the natural products are grains , grass , and the other ordinary*tillage crops of this country ; while in New Mexico and Arizona the finer fruits may be advantageously cultivated . There can be no question that the development of the irrigation system in the Rocky Moun // tains is sure to give rise to a great many definitely limited agricultural populations , each separated from the other by broad fields of arid mountains , which here and there will afford employment to miners . When this condition of culture is instituted , we shall thus have a singular localization of life and industry , the like of which can not exist in the other parts of the continent , where there are no barriers of a distinct sort between the several fertile districts . The principal economic basis of the Cordilleran life must for many centuries rest upon the mining industry . The geological development of this section from the time the rocks were laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deeply buried and finally uplifted by the mountain foldings , has served to prepare a vast range of mineral wealth by nature and position well suited to the needs of man . So far the mining industry of this section is in the main turned to the precious metals , and we have come to associate the idea of mining in this district with the winning of gold and silver . Although we as yet know comparatively little concerning the under-earth resources of this district , it is evident that it contains a wide range of mineral products , perhaps a greater variety than is known to exist in any other country , all of which will , with the progress of exploration and the cheapening of mining costs , become the bases of industries . Coal , iron , and various alkaline salts , the varieties of bitumen , quicksilver , lead , zinc , and a host of other substances which have a place in our industries , exist in profitable quantities in this region . The fact that a large part of the country can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mining population without the distant carriage now required to bring it to this field . Great as is the measure of man 's dependence on the resources of the underearth in the present condition of his development , there is every reason to believe that this dependence will be iuanifolded within a century from our day . We are evidently nowhere near the end of the growth in our mineral industries . The underground workers are evidently to be , in the century to come , something like as numerous as the soil tillers . Therefore , in our forecast , we must reckon on the development of a body of population in the regions of the Cordilleras which can not readily be imagined by the traveller who hastens through their apparently sterile wastes . The general cimatal conditions of this section give promise that it will afford an admirable field for the nurture of northern Europeans . Although newcomers in the highlands generally suffer from certain maladies attendant on the change of station , the children born in the region seem very vigorous , and the acclimatized man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of success which our race has secured in the Cordilleras is a matter of no small interest to the philosophical student of our country . Until the settlement of this district our Anglo-Saxon folk had never come to occupy a region of highlands . They were characteristically lowlanders in their origin and history , and it was an open question whether the blood would prosper in such countries . It might have been feared that it would have proved unfit for mountain life , as it has proved unfit for the conditions of the tropics . The sight of vigorous children , and young men and women of admirable physique , who have been bred in the Cordilleran highlands , is most satisfactory to those who have a keen interest in the future of our race . On the Pacific slope we have three areas which are open to our race-the Californian , Oregonian , and Alaskan . The Californian section , extending from the peninsula of southern California to the northern borders of California proper , is a region of mountain valleys , lying in the foot-hill district of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to make an extensive and varied agriculture possible ; the climate is in general of an admirable quality , and the soil , which occupies perhaps one-half the total area , of a great fertility . Although such a long shore , the coast is poorly provided with harbors . The fishing-grounds are not very good , and the maritime life is likely to be less considerable than along any equally extended part of the American // coast . On the other hand , the mining districts are blended with the tillage grounds in such a manner that they complement each 6ther . So far the under-earth resources which have been won have been mainly those of the precious metals ; there is every reason to believe , however , that in the future the grosser earth products are to play a very large part in the economic success of the district and in the diversification of its industries . A high grade of agriculture , exceedingly varied mining , under a climate which is on the whole favorable in its effects on the human frame , give promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The district of Oregon , including the western portion of that State and the neighboring sections of the State of Washington , as well as a considerable part of the Frazer River district on the north , differs from California in its more humid climate , the proportionately wider extent of its tillage grounds , but most markedly in the great extent of its inland maritime waters , the abundance of its harbors and straits , the nurseries of seamen . Here , too , the fisheries attain a marked value , so that there is a great foundation for ocean industries . The mining opportunities of the Oregonian district , though perhaps less considerable than those of the central Cordilleras or of California , are still great . In this section , from the Frazer River to the Columbia , extending back two or three hundred miles from the sea , we have the most varied opportunities for industries which are afforded by any portion of the American continent . Coal is probably abundant ; there are numerous excellent water-powers , and the soil within the limits of the humid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and of great extent , and the maritime resources appear to have a value unequalled on any portion of the American continent . The region has been blessed by the character of its settlers , for they have been derived from the most vigorous portion of the race . Taking it for all and all , the physiographer is more disposed to foretell greatness for this section than for any other equally extensive area on the western border of the continent . North of the Frazer River , and thence to the Yukon , we have a district which by its physiography is peculiarly suited for a maritime life . In general the character of the surface , soil , and climate of this region more clearly resembles the Scandinavian peninsula than any other part of the American continent ; save that the area open to tillage is less considerable than in Sweden and Norway , the general conditions very closely reproduce those of our race 's cradle-land . In this field , which is destined to have a peculiar place in the development of our race , agriculture can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Indeed , with the development of any considerable population , they must depend upon the Oregonian and Californian districts for their grain-supply . Mining and fishing are the natural occupations for the populations which are to be developed in this interesting region . - We have now completed our proposed rapid survey of the physiographic conditions which determine , in a general way , the development of our race on the continent of North America . It will be observed that we have excluded from consideration the whole of Mexico and Central America , the archipelago of the Antilles , as well as all the wide expanse of lands neighboring to the Arctic Ocean . The Arctic region does not interest us because in the present condition of its climate these territories are sterilized by cold , and are therefore without the province of our people . The southern parts of the continent , though offering regions of delightful climate and great fertility , are also unsuited to our race . Much has been said concerning the change which the European population has uz*dergone in the course of generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the British portion of our population has been greatly altered by its experience on the continent of North America . There has been a good deal of talk about the American type of man . He is supposed to be a thinner and more angular creature than his cousins of the parent isle . It has been held that , though quicker witted , readier to fit himself to circumstances , he has less // solidity , less endurance than his ancestors from beyond the seas . There can be no question that our climate , as a whole , differs considerably from the conditions of northern Europe , whence our race came . It is generally drier , the alternating seasons cooler and hotter ; it has , because of its relatively unclouded sky , more sunlight . There is a natural presumption that such variations would lead to considerable alteration of the race . It may be that a certain measure of physical change has taken place . I propose at once to set forth the reasons which lead me to the opinion that the change , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it has not injuriously affected the qualities of the people . It is worth while , at the outset of our inquiry , to note the evidence which serves to show that racial qualities are not always the playthings of climate . Fortunately for our argument we have in this country some striking bits of evidence on this point . A large part of our population is of African descent , mostly derived from the Guinea coast , from conditions of climate very different from those which prevail in the Southern States of North America-from a social as well as a physical environment differing vastly from what exists in this country . The African race has by its transplanting undergone a vast change in its conditions . The Africans have been , so to speak , on the average , upon this soil for nigh two hundred years-that is , they are as Americans about as ancient as the white population . So far as we can determine , the several generations of this race 's life in a totally foreign climate has not affected any of their original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the hair , the mental qualities still remain , so far as we can determine , essentially unchanged , except so far as the blood has become mingled with that of the whites . This stubbornness of race characters is all too little appreciated . We commonly neglect it in our political considerations , but the naturalist can not omit to consider it in his reckonings . Although the history of British settlements in torrid regions shows that the population of northern Europe is not suited to equatorial conditions , there is nothing in the experience of the race which would lead us to suppose that the measure of change undergone in passing from the parent country to the portion of the United States north of the region about the Mexican Gulf should produce any marked alteration in the racial qualities . It is a difficult matter to compare the condition of two bodies of people on opposite sides of the sea . We can not trust to the impressions of travel , for no man can retain sufficiently accurate memories for such judgments . Here and there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps afford a sufficient basis for an opinion on this point . The most important of these facts are those pertaining to longevity , as determined by the experience of life insurance companies , those obtained by the measurements of soldiers and sailors , and the endurance which such men exhibit in their callings . The results of surgical operations serve also to indicate the vitality of the patient , and the success attained in games of a sort which demand a higher measure of mental and bodily vigor , shows something concerning the essential qualities of the men . It would be desirable to add to this list the measurement derived from the intellectual accomplishment of the two countries , the success in various walks of a learned and imaginative work . Unfortunately , this last measurement can not be justly applied , for the reason that intellectual accomplishi*ent depends not so much on native ability as on peculiar circumstances of scholarly environment , on education , and on the competence of the social conditions to stimulate the creative mind . . . . Shakespeares or Bacons possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there is the stimulating air to quicken the native spark into a flame . Taking the conditions which I have mentioned in the order in which they are presented , we note in the first place the conviction on the part of our actuaries , the computers who determine the measure of insurance risk on human life , that the longevity of people in America is at least as great as in Europe , // and this despite the fact that men 's lives in this country are more seriously taxed than in the Old World . We are supposed to be dying of overwork , but the fact is that , witnessed by the duration of life in the case of men who have appeared on the records of insurance companies , there is no indication that the term allowed to man is growing less in this country than it is across the seas . On the contrary , the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that the American man lives longer than those of the same race in the Old World . We have next to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a well-known fact that in this country , during our civil war , there was a surprising percentage of recoveries from gunshot and other lesions incurred in battle . I believe it is a fact that in no European campaigns has the percentage of recoveries ever been as great as it was during our civil war . Although our surgeons were devoted , and the noble auxiliary corps of nurses untiring in their efforts to assuage the ills of battle , we can not , it seems to me , attribute this remarkable percentage of recoveries to remedial measures alone . Our surgeons and physicians employed in the civil war were not in general so well instructed as those of Europe , and the means of succor on our battle-fields were probably no better than they are in modem days in the Old World . It seems to me that this fact of ready recovery from wounds can not be explained save by the supposition that , on the whole , the American*s body has more recuperative power than that of the European . It may possibly be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption of alcohol , and in part to the mental activity and courage in adversity which is bred in our men by their varied activities . Be this as it may , the rude experience of war seems to indicate that our men are as enduring as any from other countries . The probability that the survival from wounds is due in part to the innate condition of our people finds some support in the observations of Dr. BrownS*quard , which were communicated to me personally some years ago . This gentleman , as is well known , is a distinguished physician , as well as a physiologist of the foremost rank , having a place among the famous experts in this branch of science who are now the glory of France . Dr. Brown-S6quard had observed that American animals generally-not only men , but the lower mammals down to the level of the rabbit-are much more enduring to wounds than the kindred forms of the Old World . He regarded this peculiar endurance to lesions as the result of a difference in the nervous system , which made the creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably than those of Europe . He stated that , in order to produce a given amount of destmctive effect in experimenting on a rabbit , he had to make the wounds of the nervous system much more severe than in the case of European animals upon which he was performing the same experiment . In his opinion the American man had something of the same element of resistance to injuries . The next point of evidence is that which is afforded by the record of field sports in this country and of Europe . While the conditions of higher intellectual accomplishment differ so in the two countries as to make comparison impossible , the field sports , especially those which require at once , as most of them do , the effective co-operation of mind and body , afford an excellent test as to the general condition of our folk in comparison with our English kindred  --  a comparison which includes not only the human kind , but extends also to the companions of man . It is now pretty well established that the American horse is as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved not only by the race-course , but by the wonderful cavalry marches made during the civil war , marches in which the sorest part of the contest came upon the mounts of the soldiery . Our ordinary field sports have , except lacrosse , been derived from England . Even base-ball , which appears as a distinctively American game , is but a modification of an English form of sport , which is really of great antiquity . The field sports which we may compare in England and America are the games of ball , in which base-ball , because of our customs , must take the place of cricket , // and foot-ball , which is identical in the two countries ; rifle shooting , rowing , and the ordinary group of athletic sports in which single contestants take part . We may add to this the amusement of sailing , wherein , however , the quality of the structure as well as the nerve and skill in management play an important part . It is not worth while in this writing to make an accurate comparison between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusements . It is now clear , however , that in them all the American is not a bit behind his trans-Atlantic cousins . The most of the people have the same spontaneous interest in sports as their forefathers , and they pursue them with equal success . It is unnecessary to do so , but we might fairly rest the conclusion as to the undecayed physical vigor of our population on that spontaneous activity of mind without which games are impossible . There are , however , two divisions of the proof to which we have yet to attend . Among its many beneficent deeds the United States Sanitary Commission , which did so much to relieve the miseries of our civil war , did a remarkable service to anthropology by measuring , in as careful a manner as the condition of our knowledge at the time permitted , about 250,000 soldiers of the Federal army . The records of these measurements are contained in the admirable work of Dr. B. A. Gould , a distinguished astronomer , who collated the observations and presented them in a great volume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something like an equally large number of European soldiers , particularly those of the British army . From Dr. Gould 's careful discussion of these statistics , it appears that the American man is on the whole quite as well developed as those who fill the ranks of European armies . As Dr. Gould 's book was printed in but a small edition , and is not ordinarily accessible to most readers , I venture to give some of the important conclusions which I derive from it . From these records it appears that there is a considerable difference in the men born in different parts of the United States . Unfortunately the results include only a small part of the Southern troops , and for various reasons these measurements are less trustworthy in the case of troops from those fields . The measurements appear to show that the size of man increased , in a general way , as we go from the seaboard into the Mississippi Val-ley About fifty thousand men who were subjected to these measurements were from the States of West Virginia , Kentucky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are acquainted with the history of these commonwealths during the civil war , that the Federal army did not receive an even share of the most vigorous element of their population ; those grown upon the richest soils of these commonwealths , men from the blue-grass district regions of Kentucky and Tennessee , regions where it only needs a little local observation to show to be most prolific in well-developed specimens of humanity , went in the main to the Confederate army , for the reason that these fertile lands were slaveholding districts . Despite this cause , which doubtless serves to lower somewhat the average measurements of the tro9ps , these two States furnished about the best-developed native soldiers who appeared in the Federal army . This last point is of much importance , for the reason that the white population of this district derived almost all its blood from Britain , in perhaps somewhere nearly equal measure from the Scotch and the dwellers in the southern portion of that island . Moreover , it has been longer upon the soil than perhaps any other part of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immigration of Irish and other Europeans , that it would be difficult to recruit 50,000 men in that region with as small an admixture of other than British blood as was secured in the troops of Kentucky , Tennessee , and the neighboring States . The admirable development of these soldiers has completely proved that something like two centuries of Americanizing does not debilitate the race . Last of all , we have the test afforded by the trials of the struggle between North and South . War has ever been the rudest and the most effective gauge // of certain important qualities . The actual advance to which the living beings have attained has been in large part determined by the measure of resistance which creatures have been enabled to make against adverse circumstances , not the passive inertia of inanimate things , but the active and long-continued contest in which all the latent powers are applied in determined action . The military struggles of men ate but an advanced and complicated form of the immemorial rivalry of lower creatures , out of which , through infinite pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching test of the moral and physical development of a people than that which is afforded by a great and long-continued civil war . That such a strife affords a measure of the physical endnrance , the power which is in the people of maintaining determinations is manifest . The contact of armies in the field gives , moreover , an excellent measure as to the moral state of the people . Nothing.so tests the firmness with which the motives of sympathy , of justice are rooted in men as the temptations which campaigns expose them to . It is hard , in our ordinary well-regulated societies , to ascertain how far men are held to right doing by the machinery of the law , how far their relations to their fellows are fixed by their own motives . The ratio of compulsion to spontaneous motives becomes evident when the men of the State are marshalled into armies . This test was made thoroughgoing by the circumstances of our civil war . In the first place , the combatants fought for more ideal issues than men commonly do . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for theories of institutions , of plans for States that they contended . No war was ever so humanely conducted as this . There were grievous things about it ; all war is a succession of griefs ; but the conduct of the armies in the field was more humane than in any other similar campaigns which the world has known . The interests of women and children were almost invariably considered . The soldiers born upon the soil generally carried the civic sense , the order of peaceful society , with them in march and battle . Good-nature and sympathy were written on their banners . We have but to compare the struggles between the French and Spaniards in Florida , or the wars between the American colonies of the British and French , to see how humanized our armies were under circumstances which , in other lands and times , have awakened the devil in men . The issue of the combat , the perfect accord and loving humor which now marks the men who met on battle-fields , shows this in the clearest possible manner . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to have lost nothing in the moral gains which the race won in the Old World . If we compare the issue of the contest with the chronic conditions of dispute between Great Britain and Ireland , I think we may claim that we have gained in the moral qualities which appear in the conduct of public affairs . The conduct of our armies in the field shows clearly that the combination of physical vigor and moral earnestness which make a good soldier exist in unsurpassed measure in the men whose ancestors dwelt long upon the American soil . Some years ago I sought carefully to find a body of troops whose ancestors had been for many generations upon our soil , and whose ranks were essentially unmixed with foreigners , or those whose forefathers had been but a short time upon this continent . It proved difficult to find in the Northern armies any commands which served the needs of the inquiry which I desired to make . It seemed necessary to consider a force of at least five thousand men in order to avoid the risks which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the custom to put in the same brigade regiments from different districts , thus commingling commands of pure American blood with those which held a considerable percentage of foreigners , or men of foreign parents . I found in my limited inquiry but one command which satisfied the needs of the investigation , and this was the First Brigade of Kentucky troops in the rebel army . In the beginning of the war this brigade was recruited mostly in the slave-holding district of Kentucky , its ranks being filled mainly with farmers ' sons . It is // possible to trace the origin of the men in this command with sufficient exactitude by the inspection of the musterrolls . Almost every name upon them belongs to well-known families of English stock , mainly derived from Virginia . It is possible , in a similar way , to prove that , with few , unimportant exceptions , these soldiers were of ancient American lineage . Speaking generally , we may say that their blood had been upon the soil for a century and a half ; that is , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first recruited this brigade contained about five thousand men . From the beginning it proved as trustworthy a body of infantry as ever marched or stood in the line of battle . Its military record is too long , too varied , to be even summarized here . I will only note one hundred days of its history in the closing stages of its service . On May 7 , 1864 , this brigade , then in the army of General Joseph Johnston , marched out of Dalton 1,140 strong , at the beginning of the great retreat upon Atlanta before the army of Sherman . In the subsequent hundred days , or until September 1st , the brigade was almost continuously in action or on the march . In this period the men of the command received 1,860 death or hospital wounds , the dead counted as wounds , and but one wound being counted for each visitation of the hospital . At the end of this time there were less than fifty men who had not been wounded during the hundred days . There were 240 men left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search into the history of warlike exploits has failed to show me any endurance to the worst trials of war surpassing this . We must remember that the men of this command were at each stage of their retreat going farther from their firesides . It is easy for men to bear great trials under circumstances of victory . Soldiers of ordinary goodness will stand several defeats , but to endure the despair which such adverse conditions bring for a hundred days demands a moral and physical patience which , so far as I have learned , has never been excelled in any other army . I doubt not that as satisfactory evidence can be obtained from the records of our Northern troops ; indeed my inquiries have clearly indicated that if our men from the districts settled with purely English blood could be made the subject of careful study , we would find that the best Federal soldiers were generally as good as these Confederates . The foregoing considerations , as well as many other points which can not be traced in this brief study concerning the effects of cimatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me - as I think they will satisfy any other unprejudiced inquirer-that our race is safe upon this continent ; that we need have no apprehensions concerning the effect of the existing conditions upon its development . We may safely presume that the climate and other conditions of our continent , with perhaps the exception of the district about the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic country , are , on the whole , as well fitted for the uses of northern Europeans as any part of the mothercountry . We may reasonably conclude that it suits the whole Teutonic branch of the Aryan race . As to the Latin peoples , the case is not so clear . The Canadian French are doubtless in the main descended from the people of northern France . It is likely that a large part of their blood is derived from the Northmen . There can be no question that , with certain limitations , this population has been thoroughly successful on American soil . The fact that they speak a foreign language , and have been deprived of education , may account for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , people of vigorous minds and enduring bodies . They have developed a fecundity now unparalleled in France . They take naturally to laborious occupations , which is a proof of physical vigor . We may therefore consider the northern Frenchman as . well fitted to the conditions of northern America . The Latin peoples about the Gulf of Mexico have not been equally successfuL The upper class has maintained something of its pristine quality , but the peasant has not taken hold on the soil in a successful way . How much of this failure of the Spanish and French to attain a high development in the region about the Gulf of // Mexico and the Caribbean is due to climate , and how much to the institution of slavery , it is impossible to say . There remains one important inquiry as to the effect of geographic conditions on the development of races from beyond the sea on the surface within the limits of North America , a question of the utmost importance to our political and social future . We have in this country a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , the number of people of this blood probably exceeds that of any other stock , save that from the British Isles . As we have previously remarked , this race , on the whole , appears to have remained substantially unchanged by the conditions of the new field . Intellectual contact with the white has doubtless led to a certain development in the general status of the African , but except so far as his blood has been mingled with that of Aryan or Indian people , the bodily form , and in general the moral and mental characteristics , have remained substantially what they were on the parent continent of this people . There are two questions concerning this race which are of the utmost importance to the future of our nationindeed , to that of all our own people in North America . The first concerns the natural fecundity of the population , their rate of increase from decade to decade ; and the second , the limitations which climate may put upon the extension of the folk . The rate of increase of the negro has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a satisfactory census was impossible . The slaves were subject to taxation , and the owners had a sinister interest in reducing the numbers which were given to the accounting officers . The census of 1870 , the first taken after the overthrow of slavery , partly intentionally or by neglect , served to underestimate the total number of negroes . The next accounting , that of 1880 , was careful , and doubtless gave us the first accurate knowledge as to the ratio of this element of our population to those of European blood . It will not be until we obtain returns of the census , which has just been taken , that we shall know whether the negro is more or less prolific than the white . In case it should appear that in the extreme southern States the negro increases in a greater ratio than the whites , the regions in which this increase is marked have a doubtful future before them , for unless the black population can be quickly lifted to a higher intellectual and moral plane than now characterizes it , those parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The advance of the negro to a satisfactory grade in development still depends upon his remaining in close contact with the superior race . If he increases in numbers more rapidly than the whites , he is sure to create massive communities of his own stock in which there can be no certainty as to the maintenance of our race motives . As to the distribution of the African population in this country , though the evidence is not clear , it seems that the negro is not likely , in the immediate future at least , to extend for any considerable distance beyond the limits in which his race at present is fixed . There is now no distinct movement of the blacks toward the North . The scanty African population in the old non-slaveholding States has mainly accumulated in the cities , and would probably die out were it not for the occasional accessions it receives from the South . Unless the rate of increase of the negroes should be so great as to crowd them from the extreme southern States , we may be pretty sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small part of our country , to a region which , though not unfitted for the occupation of our race , is the most undesirable part of the country for its development . Our review of the physiographic conditions which environ our race on this continent makes it tolerably plain that North America is well suited for the development of northern Europeans . We may dismiss the fear that our race is to deteriorate in this country . We may farther put aside the notion that we are to be a massive , unvaried people , destitute of those differences which by their reaction bring about the advance of man . It is true that the continent is not divided into the separate areas which have constituted the cradle-lands of the Old World , but it is evident that // the wide diversities in occupation will institute and maintain variations in the character of the people probably in time to be as great as those which in the more natural state of man depended on purely geographic conditions . At present , while the open structure of our social and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effect of industries dependent on physiographic conditions is not much felt ; but with the increase and consolidation of our population , we may be sure that vocations will become more hereditary . Men will follow the occupations of the plough , the mine , or the mill from generation to generation , and so the communities will receive the individualized stamp which comes only through ancestral habit . In the beginning mankind was dependent for culture and diffusion mainly upon geographic conditions . Each tribe was environed by rigid customs which fended off its neighbors . The movements were necessarily massive , for they were to result in displacements of pre-existing peoples . Therefore the first stages of man 's development resemble , as regards the conditions of increase and diffuision , those of his lowerkindred in the ranks of life . The progress of intellectual capacity has given to certain races a larger measure of control over their circumstances . Still , even in our own centuries , the implantation of our race in new lands already possessed by men has proved a task of exceeding difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the eastern coast of America , found something of the difficulty in gaining their foothold which stray plants or animals from one flora or fauna find when they are cast within a foreign field . Even in the present state of their development the most advanced races of men are limited by the climate , and can only dwell where the larger nature permits . For all that we can foresee of the future , this dependence of man upon the conditions of his environment is of an insuperable nature . The good he wins he secures by obedience to the commands of his mother-earth . Looking back over the history of life upon the earth 's surface , the physiographer is forced to the conclusion that its highest estate embodied in the moral and intellectual qualities of man has been , in the main , secured by the geographic variations which have slowly developed through the geological ages . Thus our continents and seas can not be considered as physical accidents in which , and on which , organic beings have found an ever - perilous resting - place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the advance of life.
