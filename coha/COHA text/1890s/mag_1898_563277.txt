txt I AM superintendent of schools in a New England city , and have been in my present position a number of years . I held a similar position in another city for a considerable time . These experiences , with my previous experiences as a principal , have made me acquainted with school boards and school management . No man can be superintendent of schools for a number of years without seeing mistakes that he himself and other superintendents make , nor without desiring various changes in the public school system . Some confessions concerning school committees , teachers , courses of study , and superintendents I wish to make , in the hope that thoughtful men may ponder these things , and use their influence to effect some much - needed changes . The majority of every school board consists of honorable , high-minded men , anxious for the good of the schools . Among more than two hundred men under whom I have served I have formed a large number of warm friendships , and to most of them I have been indebted for strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of whose members could be relied upon to vote always for what they believed to be the interests of the schools , regardless of pulls . " " Pulls " affect chiefly two matters , - the selection of textbooks and the appointment of teachers . As to textbooks a great many mnembers of my school committees have always voted conscientiously . Of books whose sale is not large , - high school books , reference books , supplementary reading , - the selections have usually been made on the recommendation of myself and the teachers who are to use the books . The case is entirely different with books whose sale is large and profitable , such as readers , arithmetics , geographies , grammars , copy - books , and spelling - books . The rival publishers ' agents divide the committee into two or three hostile camps , and arouse an anxiety on the part of many of the school committee for the success of their side only ' less intense than the agents themselves feel . I have learned to keep out of book fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified reserve on the question , even to the extent of displeasing my friends who really desire my advice as to which is the best book . Doubtless this confession will read to some like the words of a coward . But why should a superintendent ruin his chances of success in things more vital to the schools than the use of this or that arithmetic ? I am on good terms with book agents . I find them always genial and well informed . It is a pleasure to chat with them , but it will not do to make them any promises . The larger book houses employ two kinds of agents : the skirmishers and the beaters-up of the bush , and the men who do the heavy work when the crisis comes . The latter usually keep away from me . If they meet me , they hasten to say that " they respect my position , and will be careful not to involve me in the struggle . " My school committee at the present time is of considerable size , and is managed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive for all school purposes . Probably the citizens generally do not understand this , but it is known to all the school committee , and acquiesced in by alL A few chafe under it , - some because they do // not belong to the ring , and others because they see the thorough selfishness of the management ; but no one rebels . The managers mean to have good schools ; they are far-seeing men , to whom a definite policy can be presented with the certainty that it will be comprehended , and the probability that it will be approved unless it will affect unfavorably some of their friends . " Working for one 's friends , " in itself a praiseworthy thing and accounted by politicians the highest virtue , is the bane of the schools . The average committee man looks at all questions from this point of view , " How will it affect me and my friends ? " not , " How will it affect the schools ? " The man who can get upon a school committee is the man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually a politician or one who aspires to political influence . The man next to him in evil influence is likely to be the pastor of a church , for whose members and their sons and daughters he must do what he can to find places or to maintain them in their places . The politician is looking for him , and quickly offers his aid . The good clergyman , in return for the aid of the politician in securing a place for A , " who is a worthy case , " agrees to vote for B , of whom he knows little , and as to whom he shuts his eyes if the revelations are likely to trouble his conscience . Then there is the doctor who feels under obligations to his patients , or to those for whom his patients request his favor . The best members of a school committee are lawyers and business men who handle large enterprises . These men are more independent than others , and have broader views . A scheme of instruction or a plan of management will be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to its effect on certain individuals . What use in talking to a man about some plan for improving the teaching force of a city , when the main query in his mind is , " How will this affect my chances of getting teachers appointed , or how will it serve my other interests ? " This personal question and the combinations made to effect its satisfactory answer are what is meant by " school politics . " In twenty years of school teaching and superintending I have not known any school question to be decided by Democrats or Republicans as such . I have read and heard that such influences have affected other superintendents , but they have never affected me . So far as the appointment and retention of teachers are concerned , the whole foundation of evil is broadly covered by this unblushing declaration of a San Francisco school director - " I was brought up in this town , and of course have a certain number of friends who want and expect positions . Each director appoints his own friends and relatives , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the full board when it meets to elect candidates . That is a courtesy which is extended by every director to each of his fellow directors , - the minority , of course , excepted . " My own experience is that school committee men act upon the same principle in New England as in California , though they are less outspoken about it . The appointment of teachers is as well managed as are other city appointments . The poor get relief , the streets are laid out , the police are selected , not on the sole basis of the best service to the public , but , in many cases , on the plan of every man getting as much for his neighborhood or his friends as possible . An alderman who can not get work on the streets or in the parks for his constituents , who has small influence in securing places on the police force or in the fire department , will have small chance of reelection , in many wards . A remedy for the evils connected with // appointments must be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a public trust , " and not a " private snap . A generation of schoolchildren must be trained to right views on such questions . The schools must share in the general moral nplift ; yea , more , they must stand apart from ordinary municipal departments as something to be managed on a higher moral plane . The evil influence of the appointment of teachers by means of " pulls " does not appear so much in the character of the persons appointed as it does in the demoralization of the body of teachers . It removes a strong incentive to personal improvement . If appointments depend on " pulls , " so may promotions and transfers . Each teacher feels secure in her position as long as she has a friend who has influence , or who is on friendly terms with some one who has it . It has several times happened to me that teachers who have been admonished of some neglect , mistake , or inefficiency have gone to their friends for protection , instead of avoiding danger by trying to do better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dealing with teachers who fail in their work and depend upon influence to keep their positions is one of the chief troubles of a superintendent . His greatest difficulty with teachers is with those - and their name is legion - who are conscientious and painstaking , anxious to do well , always doing their best , and yet from lack of vigor and adaptation failing to become efficient . A superintendent , even if he have the heart to dismiss such teachers , will rarely find either his committee or the public supporting his action ; for no one but himself realizes how schools suffer from such teachers . While making " confessions , " I must not neglect to confess that when myself a teacher , I always tried to get the poorest third of each class to do all the work laid down in the course of study . This was a constant struggle , and always a partial failure . The very poorest were dropped to the grade below , or left behind at the class promotion ; while many , with much sighing on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not by right , obtained promotion . When I became a superintendent the same plan was continued for a time , as I then knew no better way . Such struggle and partial accomplishment are not the right processes for intellectual development , and through them the moral nature receives much harm . Perhaps the results to the most capable pupils are quite as damaging as to the poorest ones . Tied down to those inferior in speed , they have fretted at the slow progress , if they were ambitious ; or they have grown indifferent , disposed to dillydallying , if they quietly accepted the conditions . Their loss includes not merely the failure to gain what might have been gained , but also the habit of half-hearted effort . More and more I sympathize with bright pupils , for our public schools often fail to meet their needs and give them inspiration . The remedy for these evils is not far to seek . Make the course of study for the slower , weaker pupils , and let the brighter ones go faster or take additional work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of these alternatives is the correct one ; in the higher grammar grades and in the high school , additional work in a heavier course is the proper remedy . The bright pupils ought to work as hard as the dull ones . The teacher of the bright division ought to work as hard as the teacher of the slower division , - in the one case in laying out more work , in the other in seeking simpler explanations . The superintendent is less secure in his position than the humblest teacher . In all the large towns in New England , whatever their nominal term , teachers have practically life tenure of office . They need but to do their duty , and only // their duty , to ' hold their positions past the days of their most efficient service . Whatever may have happened outside my range of observation , within it I have never known a teacher to lose a position that he deserved to retain . The superintendent must stand the shocks . He is the victim of the political overturns . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . Protecting a teacher in her control of her school may bring him into collision with an irate and influential citizen . All general failures and most special ones are laid at his door . If the superintendent amounts to much , he will be found in the way of the plans of unscrupulous persons and their selfish interests . If he amounts to little , he will be accused of inefficiency and lack of backbone . The superintendent who loses his place is often superior to him who retains his place . The fact of holding or losing one 's place is no proof of real merit . The superintendencics in the small towns are more difficult to fill than those in the large towns . The duties are more multifarious , tempests arise on smaller provocations , there is more gossip , and one or two citizens are more likely to control the fate of the superintendent . A man who remains several years at his post in a small town , and is respected by all citizens as a sincere and capable official who is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the place of a superintendent in a large town who is never heard from as accomplishing anything either by action or by inhibition . The superintendent in a large town is less under watch and ward . He can differentiate his system and try experiments without incurring expense or distracting the teachers . He has a better opportunity for intellectual and professional growth . He can concentrate his efforts on the professional rather than on the business side of his work , and become an expert whose judgment carries weight in all educational matters . But in any place , small or large , that superintendent will in the long run be most secure who stands honestly , decidedly , and yet courteously , for right methods , good teachers , and fair dealing . II . As in most communities in the South and West , the prevailing sentiment regarding schools and school-teaching here where I serve is that the schoolroom is a very proper place to pension indigent gentlewomen . Teaching is regarded as a dignified calling for anybody in indigent circumstances who is unable to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application one hears : " I have a young friend who has been through the high school , whose father is dead , and who is obliged to support her mother . She is a nice girl and a good girl , and I want you to help me get her a school . " " Has she any preparation for teaching ? Has she ever attended a normal school , or studied with reference to teaching ? " " Oh no , but I think she will make you a good teacher , and I want you to give her a trial . " Such an argument does not convince the superintendent , but it is very persuasive with kind-hearted members of the board of education . So they supplement the request that the young lady may have a fair trial at the examination . " Be easy on her for her father 's sake . " Upon one occasion I made a report to the board of education , in which I took strong ground in favor of allowing only those to teach in our public schools who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the board met me afterward and remarked that the report was excellent in theory , but in these degenerate times it was impracticable . // Since then some of my theories in regard to teachers have changed . I have found very fine teaching power in some young women who never saw the inside of a normal school , and whose record for scholarship in our local high schools was not the best . They had that unexaminable , indefinable power of controlling , interesting , and instructing children that seems to be an endowment . No normal school can give this ability , and no lack of normal school training can take it away . The best that a normal school can do is to develop the teaching talent and direct the teaching power , so that the born teacher will not waste time in learning her own strength by practicing on her pupils . We must come to this proposition in our town and in other towns , namely , that a teacher can be discovered only by her teaching , and the best examination possible is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who appears to have all the requisites , - a good education , good health , and a fair knowledge of what the demands of the schoolroom are , - and the only true way to proceed is to give her three months , or longer if advisable , as a trial . She will then show what she can do , and I do not believe that a satisfactory test can be made in any other way . I have two cases in point . Several years ago a young woman came to me for a school , and as I talked with her I made up my mind that she would not be a good teacher . She became a candidate before the board for a position , however , and her friends were active . I could do nothing but consent " to give her a trial , " though I looked upon the trial as likely to be a failure , and I so expressed myself . To my utmost surprise , the young woman walked into the schoolroom , took up the reins of management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get hold of , and at the end of three years was the leading teacher of her grade in the city . To-day her grade work is the model for younger teachers , who love to see " how easily she manages. ** On the other hand , I observed in a rural school a young woman who I thought was the very person I needed for a certain kind of work in the city schools . I made it my business to see the board of education , and guaranteed the excellence of her work . I staked my reputation as a superintendent on her ability to teach . The board consented , and I sent for the young woman and told her of my recommendations . To my ch'agrin , she seemed lost from the day she began . She never saw the difference between an ungraded rural school of thirty pupils and a graded school of fifty pupils . Her previous training had ruined her for other work , and she did not get control of the situation . She struggled on for three years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimony . One of the most perplexing problems that ever confronted a superintendent is what to do with an old , poor , and thoroughly inefficient teacher . I have such a problem before me now . On one side there are the pupils , who are poorly taught and badly disciplined . Their time is practically wasted , and the people say it is a shame to keep such a person upon the teaching corps . The taxpayers also complain that the board ought to have the courage to discharge the aged and incompetent teacher ; but this complaint is made in a very quiet and confidential way . On the other side is the fact that the old lady has served the board thirty years , has been a faithful teacher , is now old and poor , and to discharge her means the poorhouse for her and several dependents . There is absolutely nobody to take care of her . Should we discharge her , the very persons who say that she ought to be dismissed would rise up and declare it was an outrage to put an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // children are learning nothing would sign a paper declaring they were perfectly satisfied , and the superintendent would be regarded as a heartless wretch , and the board of education as a soulless corporation . The law says we can not pension her , and so we are now quietly awaiting the time when , having served her day and several generations of children , she will be called to her deserved rest . Perhaps , after all , this is best . We are but human , and one case out of nearly two hundred will not seriously affect us . Sometimes , indeed many times , the people themselves are the source of our troubles . Theoretically , public opinion controls all public institutions . But this acts directly in some instances , and indirectly in other instances . In all the cases above mentioned the action was indirect , in that it had to exert itself first upon the members of the board . But now I come to speak of the direct contact of the public and the schools . Let me cite an illustration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for that purpose employed a young lady from a distance who knew her business thoroughly . She prepared some blank forms of inquiry about the physical tendencies of the pupils , and gave each one a copy to be filled out at home . The director wanted a diagnosis of each child , in order to inform herself and the grade teacher of any physical defect , such as heart disease , tendency to headache , dizziness , and the like . This was a reasonable request , but it raised a storm in town . Not more than one parent in ten would send in a report , and from those who responded we had an amusing lot of answers . One man wrote across the blank , " None of this for me . Give my boy more reading and arithmetic . " Another one said his boy 's indigestion was " very good . " In response to the query , " Are the shoulders even ? " one man said , " The right shoulder is , but the left shoulder is a little off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to one hundred inches . In short , the replies were worthless , and a good scheme was abandoned because the public would not stand such " nonsense . " Some time ago tardiness had proved to be a great nuisance , and we resolved to stop it , if we could , by closing the doors to all tardy pupils . We resolved to send them back to their homes to get a written excuse stating the reason for their being late . We hoped in this way to reduce the tardiness from five per cent to one per cent of the attendance . We thought that an allowance of one per cent was reasonable . The order was published , announcements were duly made to the pupils , and the fun began . The very first day that notes were required a dozen pupils were sent home , and did not return thateday . The next day they came with insulting notes from their parents to the effect that our rules were tyrannical and illegal . One parent *vrote , " My son was tardy because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Others were of like import . One man rent to the president of the board and gave the school system a sound rating for its rigidity ; the same man had said , a few months before , that the laxity of discipline was a disgrace . The board , however , stood by its rules , and tardiness has almost disappeared . I have found , in my experience of fifteen years , that some people will abuse any school official who stands up for what is best , but that the public will always respect him for it . Everybody likes a strong government , and has a contempt for a weak one . If one wants to have an easy time and a poor school system , he need only let things go in any fashion , and he and his schools will sleepily drift into general contempt . If he wants to have a hard time and a good school system , let him bare his front to the storm of criticism and abuse , and he // and his schools will surely win their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent of schools has been chiefly in two cities , each having a population of more than fifty thousand . In character and general municipal life these cities may be said to be polar opposites . In one there is a high degree of general intelligence , a good public spirit , a pure city government , and the schools are absolutely free from those various adverse influences which are the bane of public schools in so many cities . The school board is composed of a high class of citizens , and the people are loyal to the schools . In the other city there was , a dozen years ago , when I knew it , an exceedingly low grade of intelligence , a low moral tone , an indifference to schools and to education in general , and the board was composed of men the majority of whom were ignorant , and some of them , it was well known , were corrupt . I believe that , during the two years and a half of my work there , I met with nearly all the most embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . In this city the board consisted of fifty-two members , - four from each of thirteen wards . Since I left it , enough wards have been created to make the membership of the board sixty-four . The members were nominated and elected by wards , each ward voting only for its own representatives . The meetings of the board suggested meetings of the state legislature , and there were the caucusing , the " log-rolling , " and the partisanship of a political convention whenever questions of importance came up . There was a sprinkling of intelligent men , enough to constitute an efficient board ; the rest of the members were men who could not speak grammatically , and some of them were known in the community as men of low morals , who were not fit to come in contact either with women teachers or with children in the schools . I remember that one night at eleven o'clock I saw the president of the board leaning against a tree at the curbstone , so intoxicated that a fellow member of the board , who happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was not an unusual occurrence ; he was known as a very dissipated man at the time he was elected president . He had the support of a majority of the members until his conduct in the meetings of the board became a public scandal . The low moral tone of the board was felt throughout the schools . Teachers depended on favoritism and political " pulls , " instead of on merit , for promotion , and some were kept in their positions who were not only incompetent , but also of objectionable character . The principal of one of the high schools was known to be untruthful , absolutely untrustworthy in money matters , and an unprincipled man generally ; yet he had the support of a majority of the board for a number of years . By a provision of the city charter the board consisted of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats ; but instead of becoming non-partisan under this arrangement , it became bi-partisan . No teachers not residents of the city could be elected to positions in the schools below the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools were residents . The appointments were almost entirely made through favoritism . Political affiliations , church associations , and business relations between the friends of applicants and members of the board determined appointments to schools . The term " politics " as applied to school affairs is not always clearly understood . No question is raised as to the political party to which a teacher belongs or with which he sympathizes ; the only question is whether his appointment will procure the political influence of his friends at the next // election . It ought to be said that church influence is often more embarrassing to a superintendent than politics , and I have myself been hampered by deacons and pastors in my efforts to do the best thing for the schools . In the city above referred to there was a woman at the head of one of the high schools who was personally a very estimable woman , but who was entirely incompetent . The reason why she could not be removed was not political . The pastor of one of the leading churches and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal that the board were afraid to take the step . Ministers , through a mistaken sympathy , often allow themselves to indorse incompetent teachers , and so help to block the way for better things in the schools . In fact , a recommendation of a teacher by her pastor seldom has any weight whatever . I usually throw such documents into the waste-paper basket when applicants send them to me , unless I am personally acquainted with the minister and know that he is competent to form a critical judgment of a teacher 's work . I have made confession of a professional secret which it may do no serious harm to divulge . In the same city , where houses were erected by the school board and all contracts pertaining to the schools were awarded by the board , there was a temptation for a certain class of men to seek election to the board who could not be tempted into the public " service " by any desire to advance the public interest . Some of them secured appointments upon the building committee . It was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were handed in , and " pointers " were given to late bidders . Some of these men were constantly found on the textbook committee , and agents of publishing houses had to meet them on ground sufficiently low to reach their official good will . In a certain book contest , one young , inexperienced agent told me he gave one member of the committee money to take a trip to the seashore . To gain the good will of another , he said he accompanied him not only to saloons , but to worse places . He lost the contest , and was afterward discharged by the publisher whom he represented . In this contest , another publisher employed a special agent who was a politician , and was willing to resort to means which the regular agent could not be asked to employ . Much has been said about corruption in the relations between publishing houses and school boards . My observation has been that it all depends on the moral character of the board . Publishers will not resort to means lower than is absolutely necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have anything to do with book contests because of the dishonesty of the textbook committee . The agents of most of our publishing houses are college-bred men , high-minded , and are willing to put their business on as high a plane as school boards will permit them . In short , where school boards are pure , the textbook business is honorably conducted . The first thing to do , therefore , to elevate and improve the public schools is to secure a higher grade of people to serve on school boards . The public schools of Chicago are a more important trust to administer than Chicago University ; lkewise , the public schools of Philadelphia and of New York are more important trusts to administer than either the University of Pennsylvania or Columbia University ; and yet who would be willing to say that even a majority of the members of any school board which these cities have ever had would be suitable persons to elect as members of the boards of trustees of these institutions ? Fortunately , there are always a few men of eminent worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute a majority . // A reform can not be brought about by moral force alone . Legislation is necessary . The school systems of most of our cities require a thorough reconstruction . In the first place , the size of school boards must be reduced . The number should rarely exceed one member for every ten thousand of population , except in very small cities . In the large cities the number should be made considerably less than this . Such reduction in numbers will be made possible , however , only by reducing the work now done gratuitously by members , and giving it into the hands of paid expert agents who are to work under the general supervision of the board . At present , members of school boards are obliged to spend a very considerable portion of their time in attending to details which can be managed much more efficiently by paid experts . Business men of unusual ability , and of large business interests of their own to look after , can not afford to accept positions on a school board under existing conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to relieve the boards of official details , and to require of them only the direction of the general policy and work of the schools . In the second place , all ward representations in school boards should be abolished . Every member should be a " member at large " and should represent the whole city . When members are elected by wards , the local ward politician dictates the election . A " clean " ward will send a good man ; a ward in which the lower element is concentrated almost invariably elects a man who is not suitable for such a position . The ward politicians , controlling the ward elections , control later the official acts of members thus elected . Hence this system of election is a source of political corruption of the school board , and through it of the schools . Nomination from wards and election at large produce better results , for the whole city has a voice at the polls in determining who shall represeut each ward . But this method of election is also objectionable , because in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often impossible to find a single resident who is a suitable person to serve on a school board . There is no one method of selecting a school board that is best for all cities . In some cities the local conditions are such that appointment by the mayor is the best method ; in others , like Philadelphia , appointment by the judges of the courts seems to be fairly satisfactory . In the majority of cities , however , election by popular ballot is undoubtedly the best method . In the third place , there should be an entire separation between the educational part and the business part of the administration of the public school system in our large cities . There should be an agent for the business department and a superintendent of instruction for the educational department , each of whom should be directly responsible to the board . In the fourth place , the educational department should be intrusted more largely than it has been to the superintendent of instruction . I fail to see a good reason why there should be a committee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The making of a course of study is the work of an educational expert . The more intelligent a school committee , the more the members shrink from such a responsibility . Yet in some of our larger cities the superintendent is barely consulted when the course of study is to be revised . I see little occasion , also , for a committee on textbooks . Textbooks should be selected by the superintendent after free consultation with the teachers who are to use them . There must be more concentration of responsibility , and consequently of authority , // in the administration of school affairs . There is probably no other public official , of equal ability , intelligence , and character , who has so little real legal authority as a superintendent of schools . The mayor of a city , as a rule , has no more ability , and usually has less education , than the superintendent of schools , and yet he has very much more authority . Likewise the judges of our courts , with a life tenure , have immensely more power than men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . " One man power " becomes dangerous only when it is not linked with " one man responsibility . " In the fifth place , where the school board is elected directly by the people , and is therefore directly responsible to the people , it ought to be financially independent of the rest of the city government . It ought to have charge not only of the schools and the teachers , but also of the schoolhouses and the janitors . The city council ought to have no authority to determine how much money is to be spent on schools and school buildings . This is the only solution of the embarrassing problem of securing sufficient school room for the school population of our large cities . Cities like New York , Philadelphia , Buffalo , and Chicago fail to build schoolhouses fast enough to keep pace with the growth of population , not because they can not afford it or because the taxpayers are unwilling to be taxed more heavily for such a purpose , but because the politicians in the city government want the money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be an ordinance in every city providing that any person who has been a member of the school board shall be ineligible to any other city office for two or three years after his term of office on the school board expires . In this way , political favors done while on the school board could not at once be returned in some other form , and a position on the school board could not be made so directly as at present a stepping-stone into some " higher " municipal office . There are no doubt legal , and in some states possibly constitutional difficulties in the way of enacting such an ordinance , but it would go far toward eliminating ambitious politicians from school boards . Finally , I desire to say that I have the good fortune to live in a city in which the schools are absolutely free from political influence and from every other adverse influence ; a city in which there has been no such thing as a COiltest over textbooks for at least ten years , in which it takes from five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a better one , when a change seems desirable ; a city in which there is no demand for " home talent " that leads to a system of inbreeding which is the curse of many school systems , but in which teachers are employed who come from any part of the country , the only questions asked being such as relate to their qualifications and efficiency . The superintendent has all the freedom and power which any one can desire , and is held , as he should be , strictly responsible for results.
