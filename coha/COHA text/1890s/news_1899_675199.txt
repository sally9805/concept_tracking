txt The delay in the Municipal Assembly in the matter of authorizing pending bond issues has so seriously embarrassed the administration that It is entirely within the probabilities that the Governor will be asked to call a special session of the Legislature to abolish both houses , or at least to curtail their already limited powers . With the exception of the authority to grant permits for the erection of awnings , bay windows and newsstands , the Municipal Assembly has hardly any power except to authorize expenditure of public funds . This latter it carries out in a way that has proved disastrous to many public works , and has besides cost the city thousands of dollars in interest on payments deferred by the dilatory tactics of the city 's lawmakers . Controller Coler has had to bear the brunt of the trouble caused by the Assembly because the city 's creditors look to hint for payment of their bills , whereas he has nothing to do with the matter except in a ministerial way . In speaking of the Assembly 's delay in concurring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said yesterday : " If this thing keeps up much longer I will go to Gov . Roosevelt and ask him to call the Legislature together for the purpose of depriving the Municipal Assembly of the power which it exercises in such a dilatory way , or of abolishing it entirely . Resolutions authorizing the issue of bonds for street improvements , for laying water mains and sewers , and for the extension of the Croton watershed have been held up sometimes for months . It is not only that the city should have these needed improvements that I favor legislative action , but also that the municipal government should be sustained . We ca n't go on this way and preserve the city 's credit . My office is overrun with persons who want the money due them , and who believe that it is I who am holding back their pay . They do n't understand the situation . If I tell them to go to the Municipal Assembly , which is to blame , they do n't know what to make of it . " In 1870 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Estimate , and for twenty-seven years that system operated with marked success . Then the charter made it necessary for the Municipal Assembly to concur in the action of the Board of Estimate before the Controller could issue bonds . From that time there has been trouble . Delay has occurred in nearly every instance , and , as a consequence , work that should have been completed has not yet been begun . Right now a committee of the Council is pulling and hauling over a bond issue of $2,000,000 for repaving purposes , which passed the Board of Estimate early in March . There are other issues of almost equal importance pending , and there seems to be no more hope of their passage than there was when they were first introduced . It is only a day or so ago that the Commissioner of Water Supply had to lay off workmen in the Croton watershed because the Assembly had failed to pass a bond issue which has been before it for months . " I am in earnest about this matter , and I feel sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there is - a. change for the ' better . " The Mayor has repeatedly sent messages to the Assembly asking it to take action on these bond issues , but in most cases his requests have received no attention . It is only when a bond issue for a spectacular purpose , like the reception to Admiral Dewey , is before the Assembly that quick action is taken . In that instance there was a little opposition , but by far the larger number of the members of the Assembly hastened to give their assent to an expenditure of $150,000 , for fear , apparently , that they would draw upon themselves the criticism of the press and the condemnation of their constituents . Among the pending bond issues before both houses is the resolution appropriating $570,000 for the purchase of the plant of the Long Island Water Supply Company . Influential Brooklyn politicians are interested in this concern , and it is said they have induced the Brooklyn members to oppose the issue , in the hope that they can force the city to pay a much larger sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July , 1808 , and has failed repeatedly to obtain the requisite three-fourths vote in its favor . A resolution before the Aldermen provides for an issue of 8500.000 for the acquisition of land for the Croton watershed . This land has already been seized by the city under the act of the Legislature , and the city is liable for interest at 0 per cent . per annum on the deferred payments . The Council Committee on Affairs of Boroughs ? has been wrangling since March 21 last over an ordinance authorizing the issue of $2,000 000 bonds for repaving streets . The members of the committee from the Boroughs of Brooklyn , Queens , and Richmond have managed to tie up the resolution because , as they allege , they do not believe that the Commissioner of Highways should be permitted to designate the streets to be repaved , but that this should be left to the members of the Municipal Assembly . Another resolution that has been hung up for months is one appropriating $305,000 for the Harlem River Driveway , which has aroused opposition among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to see the money expended in Manhattan , thugh the debt was incurred previous to consolidation . Litigation is threatened on account of the delay in paying this claim . The Tammany members have uniformly voted in favor of these appropriations , no matter which borough would get the improvement .
