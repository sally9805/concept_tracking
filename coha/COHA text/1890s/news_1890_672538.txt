txt The President has forgotten little and learned nothing . He meets the Congress in which his party provoked defeat , on its reassembling , with a tediously urgent exhortation to remedy none of the mistakes already made , to press forward in the same line , and trust to that Providence which the French say watches over " Americans and fools . " One subject Mr. HARRISON was bound to discuss  --  the tariff : a second he has chosen again to bring forward  --  the Force bill . On neither has he anything new to say , the only element of novelty in his treatment of them being the complete change in the declared sentiment of the people since he last addressed himself to Congress . He warns Congress not to touch the tariff law before it " has had a fair triaL " If this means anything it means that when the law has been long enough in operation the people will discover that it does not do what it was intended to do and what it has already done . A political leader who deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this can not be reasoned with . He has not reached his conclusions by reasoning ; no reasoning will change the motives that induce him to advance such a conclusion . It is simply the blind persistence of a narrow and obstinate man , who can not bring himself to acknowledge that he is in error , no matter how overwhelming may be the evidence . Mr. HARRISON , moreover , sadly mistakes the action of the people at the polls in November if he thinks that it was prompted only by resentment at the needless increase in the cost of living caused by the Tariff act . That that was one powerful incentive is true , and the people whose money was thus uselessly taken from them will not change their feeling because Mr. Ilkuntsox tells them that they do n't know their own daily affairs . But in addition to this motive there was one far more potent ? indignation at the treachery of the party in power , at its violation of its own pledges , at the cynical impudence with which it promised to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rendered hotter and more enduring by the fact that this violation of faith was made in the interest of the few at the cost of the many , for the profit of the monopolists and the trusts at the expense of tho mass of the people , and especially of those who have to depend on their daily labor for their daily living . It was the outrageous favoritism , the obvious and almost avowed corruption. , that dictated the action of the Republican managers that aroused such a tremendous revolt against them . Mr. HARRISON 'S stupid adherence to the policy of his party leaders will only convince the country more completely that the party machinery is hopelessly under the control of the rich and powerful interests that dictated the bill . As to the Force bill , we are bound to credit Mr. HARRISON with more sincerity than we can find any evidence of in his treatment of the tariff . What he says of the elections and the mode of dealing with them seems like the expression of his own thoughts . It is very unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests go , it is exceedingly foolish ; it shows a complete misapprehension of the facts , a total failure to understand the history of the last decade , or to grasp the tendency of the forces that have been very clearly at work . But it has not the false ring of his talk about the tariff and reciprocity and the subsidies to American shipping . It appears to be the genuine working of a limited intelligence upon a question that arouses strong feeling . We should say that on this subject Mr. HARRISON is honestly deceived as to the facts and the principles . He really thinks that there is in the elections in the South an amount of injustice and oppression that legislation : can punish and ultimately abolish . He does not see that such evils as there were are steadily disappearing , or that the proposed legislation would aggravate rather tb. ? ( tn remedy them , or that opinion in nis own party does not sustain that legislation , or that , if the majority in Congress should enact such legislation , it would cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . This part of his message , however , which is much the most creditable to his heart , is , perhaps , even more hopelessly mistaken as regards the political future than all the rest . There is no need to reargue the question . If the majority follow his advice , or , rather , if the leaders persist in the plan they have easily induced him to approve and urge , they will only make their situation more difficult more peril one even , than it now id . It la be8 enOtigit for them to refuse to remedy the errors they have made . It tau be far *61%6 for them in addition to plunge into others that have been condemned in advance . The extortionate tariff was a heavy load to carry .. If they pile on As% the Foreo bill , - with its vast arid varied powers a vexation and offense , they will make the load . crushing and will sink beneath it .                    @
