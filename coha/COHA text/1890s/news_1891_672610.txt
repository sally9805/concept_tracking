txt The one question that is agitating politicians here above all others is whether Gov . Hill will vacate the office of Governor on March 4 . That he ought to get out is admitted by all , and that he will remain in his present position is generally conceded , emphatically so by people who are supposed to enjoy his confidence . Many Republicans are confident that President Harrison will call a special session of the United States Senate within a fortnight , and as many Democrats declare , obtaining their cue from the Governor , that Mr. Hill will decline to go . In that event , it is argued , the Republican State Senate will pass a resolution demanding that he surrender the office of Governor , and insisting that he shall represent the State in the United States Senate or resign the office . From those politicians who have conversed with the Governor the information is given that he proposes to remain where he is until next December . One of the Governor 's intimates observed to-night that there was no law to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel him to take the office of United States Senator till he was ready to do so , and none to prevent his holding the two offices at the same time , and drawing both salaries , so long as he was not called upon to perform the duties of both simultaneously . One thing may be accepted beyond cavil , that Gov . Hill does not intend to leave the Executive chair till after the Legislature adjourns , whether there is a special session of Congress or not . He would prefer to let one of the United States Senatorial seats remain empty , rather than let Lieut . Gov . Jones hold the reins of State during the Summer months and the Fall campaign .
