The ceremony was of the simplest character , according to the rites of the Catholic Church , and the only witnesses besides the officiating clergymen were Mrs. Washington and Mrs. Ludlow , wife of Admiral ? Ludlow , mother and sister , respectively , of the bride , and Lieut . Caldwell , Admiral Dewey 's secretary .

Father Mackin went to Baltimore for this purpose yesterday afternoon . At 9:45 this morning two carriages containing the wedding party drew up before the modest red brick rectory in the rear of St. Paul 's .

Upon being presented the Admiral him additional happiness to know that he was to be married by a clergyman who had at one time followed the sea . Father Mackin replied happily that when he found he could not become an Admiral he had determined to become a priest . When a lad of seventeen years he ran away from home with two other boys and went to sea . His sea career , however , was very brief . He said that he found that he was unfitted for the life of a sailor and a few months found him back at his books , Mrs. Hazen removed her wrap , and she and the Admiral immediately took their places in the centre of the little teception room where the ceremony was performed , which made them man and wife . Fathee " Macki.n and his assistants wore simple black cassocks . Before the ceremony Father Mackin addressed the contracting parties as follows : " Before pronouncing the solemn words which will bind you forever together , it may be well to forget for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward . We are the children of God , and we have a right to call upon Him in joy and in sorrow We need His help in both extremes , and never more than now , for , although the promises you are about to make are easily made and the work of a moment , their fulfillment is the work of a lifetime . We call upon God to witness and to bless this union of which He is the author and which He has made sacred . No matter how generous and devoted you may be to each other . there are in every life moments of trial when we . in our weakness . need the help that comes from above , and this help will be given in its fullness in return for the faithful fulfillment of our obligation . The higher your position in life the more incumbent upon you is the faithful fulfillment of your obligation and the more rieorous the accounts that will be exacted . The neglect of these obligations will cast its shadow upon eternity . But this hour we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser , better , and more useful to your fellow-creatures in this life and the life beyond it , and when death at last shall break the link which binds you , as death alone can break it , may that last hour find the two hands as fondly clasped and the two hearts as closely joined as they are to-day . and may the joys of this life be a foretaste of the joys that are to come .

The Admiral kept up his famous record for being ahead of time . " He got to my house at 9e55. " said Father Mackin , with an air of amused wonder . " He and Lieut . Caldwell and I killed time until a carriage dashed up to the door . I saw it . and was beginning to tell him that the party had arrived . when I discovered that he was not there .
