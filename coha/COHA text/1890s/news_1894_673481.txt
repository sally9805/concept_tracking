txt There was nothing at all in Mr. Gladstone 's speech yesterday to indicate that he was about to lay down the cares of office because he found them too heavy for him . On the contrary , his remarks indicate that he enjoys them very much . ? His speech seemed to be inconsistent with that he made some weeks ago on the same subject . Then he seemed to be in favor of abandoning the Parish Councils bill because the Lords had deprived it of all value , and of leaving the country to decide between the two houses . The issue could not have been doubtful , for the Parish Councils bill is unquestionably very popular . Now the Prime Minister yields to the opinion of his colleagues and his party that , after all , the Parish Councils bill is worth saving , seeing that the Lords have yielded some of the points in dispute . It is obvious that a parliamentary device like the Conference Committee of Congress would facilitate British legislation . In Washington the whole dispute could have been settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the whole nation . But the dispute has been worth while , seeing that it has drawn from the Prime Minister an open declaration of war against the House of Lords , as at present constituted . Though his declaration was very carefully worded , there is no mistaking its purport . It means that a House not responsible to the people which thwarts the will of the people must either give way or be abolished , and that this will be the next issue submitted to the voters of Great Britain .
