txt The Democrats of thi country may as well make up their minds to one thing at once , if they are regarding the convention of the Populists as likely to affect , by its action , their political course in the campaign just begun . The Populists , or a great majority of them , will not ask for favors from the Bryan party that nominated the ticket at Chicago . They refuse to treat with agents of the Bryan party ; they speak of their platform as a tardy acceptance of old Populist principles ; they admit that Bryan is a Populist , but insist that he shall not be nominated or indorsed here . They will have no crown of thorns from the Bryan Democracy ; they will not assent to crucifixion of Populism upon a Populist-Democratic cross . Two sessions of the convention here occupied the Populists to-day . The first accomplished little besides the selection of a temporary Chairman . The second accomplished nothing whatever , for it was assembled in a dark hall and it was dispersed in the dark , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It really did not make much difference to a body of men who are in the dark all the time , night and day . For beyond knowing that they do not want to nominate Bryan , because they might thus part with their identity as a political organization , they are absolutely without illumination . Leaders are suspected . Every man has a platform of vagaries in his pocket . In all the platforms the disgraceful propositions uttered at Chicago are exceeded . Confiscation is added to repudiation ; paper fiat money is advocated as of more importance than silver fiat money . Democrats who are moved by a spirit of loyalty to yield their consciences to party demands are not encouraged by the exhibition that Chairman Jones of the Bryan National Committee has made here . Arriving here early , he has sanctioned reports that Chairman Hanna of the Republican Party has sought to influence the Populists with money to persuade them to refuse an indorsement of Bryan . Yet he has given nights and days to the task , now appal-. ently hopeless , of gaining from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a promise to co-operate with the Bryan Party . He has offered to the Populists , as the compensation for their approval of the Chicago candidates , Bryan and Sewall , the liberty to appoint three members of the National Executive Committee . He haS promised a fourth member to the silver party of ex-Republicans . If Mr. Hanna had dared to . do such a thing , Mr. Jones would have made the Populist press of St. Louis howl with indignation . There has been not the slightest indication of Republican attempt to influence the course of things here . They are going very well , from a Republican point of view , but not under Republican constraint . Mr. Jones knows this well enough . He knows that the Populists are defiant ; that they feel entitled to dictate terms to him rather than to entertain terms from Senator Jones and the Bryan Democracy . They are confident , possibly without cause , that they may be the second party at the polls , and the Democratic Party the third , and that if they shall not win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may make them the dictators four years later .
