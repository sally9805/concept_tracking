txt We alluded the other day to the case of PERRY , appointed to be deputy under the Tax Commissioners , as showing Tammany 's utter disregard for the requirements of the civil service law . We find , as the facts develop , that it is'not merely an instance of this particular vice of Tammany , but that it is a striking and characteristic example of the rottenness of the whole system . It is not merely that a Tammany man of incapacity and unfitness was provided with a place under the City Government in violation of the law regulating appointments . That would have been bad enough of itself , but it would have been merely one instance added to thousands . The facts were worse than this . The man thus wrongfully , illegally , and fraudulently appointed was set to work to assess for taxation the real estate in certain wards ; these wards were those that could least bear an unjustifiable increase , and also would be least likely to resist it ; the unjustifiable increase was nevertheless made , and the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark the malignant ingenuity of this whole procedure . The Tammany Mayor wishes to conceal the waste ( and worse ) of his administration by keening the percentage of taxation as low as possible . In order to do this the valuation must be raised . The part of the city selected for this purpose is the one in which property is more generally in the hands of men of moderate means and influence , , who can most safely be plundered , for the process is nothing less than one of plunder . The instrument for carrying out this plot is a subordinate of the Tax Commissioners ' department , but a , subordinate whose act ion is not subject to review by the Tax Commissioners save upon formal complaints , which in this quarter of the city , re not likely to be extensively made . This subordinate is selected . with reference to the task he has to perform , onthe backing of two Tammany leaders , " ED " stokes and Botynkm Coorrnarr .

The whole transaction , from the motive of the city administration in its inception through all the details of its accomplishment , is marked by the cynical rascality of Tammany . The device of hiding the plunder of the city under a low tax rate levied on higher valuation , the cruel selection of the victims of this device among the smaller property owners , the prostitution of the Civil Service Boarded its executive of . fibers , all reveal the spirit and purpose of the Tammany organization and of the men who guide and govern it . These are not accidents in city government , always complex and liable to miscarry at various points ; they are characteristic developments , determined by the nature , the motives , the purposes of Tammany . They ought to touch the conscience of every intelligent citizen and arouse him to work for the one means of righting this monstrous wrong ? the election of an able and honest Mayor .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
