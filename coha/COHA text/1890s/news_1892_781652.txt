txt In another column the Argus publishes the total number of personally registered voters in the cities of the State compared with the number last year . As the personally registry law did not go into effect until 1890 , no comparison with 1888 is possible , and in 1890 there was no State contest . In the thirty-two cities of the State the total number of registered voters is 766.115 , against 664,365 last year . The thirty cities outside of New-York and Brooklyn show a personally registered - vote f 274,604 this year , against 244,314 last y ar . an increase of 30,000 in round numbers . Last year these thirty cities gave a net Democratic majority of 10,000 . Four years ago they gave a net Republican majority of 8.000 . If the Republican claim be true that Republican voters did not turn out last year , then to bring the Republican vote up to a point to do the Democratic vote in these cities would require an Increased Republican registration of 10,000. and to seonre in addition the 8,000 plurality given to Harrison in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required , making 18,000 Republicans out of the increase and allowing for an increase of only 12,000 Democrats . In other words , throe Republicans must have registered for every two Democrats in this increase of 3.0,000 . Such certainly has not been the foot in Albany , and from tae best information obtainable it has not been so in the other cities of the interior . We divide the State into three sections . First , the thirty cities named which gave Harrison 8,000 out of his 13,000 plurality ; ? second , the cities of Now-York and Brooklyn . and third , the State outside of the incorporated cities . This third part , or agricultural New-York , gave Harrison 5,000 more plurality than New-York and Brooklyn combined gave Cleveland in 1888 . This portion of New-York is stationary in population . The entire increase by both State and Federal census is in the cities . The country can not cast any more votes than it did in 1888 . For various reasons it is likely to cast less . On the other hand the registered vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no living man in his senses will dispute that there are more Democrats than Republicans in that number . The registry points to three facts which have been evident conceded , and are now demonstrated by the registry . First  --  That the Democracy will do better in New-York and Brooklyn than in 1888 . Second  --  That the Republicans , under personal registry , can do no better in the remaining cities than fu 1888 . Third  --  That the Republicans can not do so well in the country as in 1888 . These considerations are based on the Republican claim that the reason they lost the State last year was because their vote did not come out . We ignore for the moment the fact that the Democratic cause has been gaining among the people of the State and . the Republican cause losing , a fact which will swell the sure Democratic majority , indicated in the registry itself .
