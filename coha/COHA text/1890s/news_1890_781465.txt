txt At the meeting of the Republican State Central Committee to-day two things - were settled . The State Convention will be held at Springfield Juno 24 , and headquarters will be immediately opened in this city . There was a division of opinion as to the proper time for holding the convention . John R. Tanner wanted a late one and ex-Gov . Oglesby favored such action by the committee . Tanner and Oglesby are training together . The former desires to be State Treasurer again and Oglesby is ambitious to go to Washington , to succeed Mr. Farwell . A late convention would help their schemes along . But A. M. Jones favored an early convention and his views were adopted . Mr. Jones proved to be about the most powerful man in the committee , and his chances of returning to political life , as Chairman of the new committee to be appointed by the State Convention , were greatly improved by the way he manipulated the meeting to-day . In the speech ! making one idea was made prominent by Gen. John MeNulta and A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of it . Gen. MoNulta said that if the Republicans expected to beat Gen. Palmer in his stump campaign for the - United States Senatorship by assailing his record as a soldier or citizen they would get the worst of it . His record - was impregnable . He had been elected Governor of the State by the Republicans , against his own wishes , by a large majority , and the Republicans had no reason to be ashamed of his record . His only fault was that afterward he had gone over to the Democratic Party .
