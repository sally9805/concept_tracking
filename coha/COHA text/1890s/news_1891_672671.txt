txt Levy Brothers &; Co. , ' wholesale clothing manufacturers at 610 , 612 , and 614 Broadway , were I closed up by the Sheriff yesterday who levied under eight writs of attachment aggregating in amount $150,747.24 , and Augustus H. Levy , one of the partners in the firm , is pronounced hopelessly insane by physicians who examined him yesterday , his mind having been unbalanced by the catastrophe which has fallen upon his house . The firm is composed of Julius Levy , a man of about sixty-five years , who resides with his family at 207 West One Hundred and Twentysecond Street ; Augustus H. Levy , about forty-five years old , or 160 West Seventh-sixth Street , and Moses S. Levy , a resident of Brooklyn . The two last-named are brothers and Julius Levy is their uncle . Early yesterday morning Deputy Sheriff ? Heimberger took possession of the establish- ' ment under two writs of attachment , which had been granted the evening before , one by Judge Andrews , in favor of the Park National Bank , for $90,615.24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for $19,709.26 . Within a very few hours news of the attachments had got around among the firm 's creditors , and the first two writs were speedily followed by six others , as follows : For Nathan Erlanger , $1,475.07 ; for William Lauterbach , $3,542.08 ; for Nathan May , $25,000 ; for the Pacific Bank , $1,664.29 ; for Julius Bailin of Bailin , Joseph &; Co. , $2,24t1.30 , and for John C. Downing , $1,640.38 . The affidavits upon which the writs of attachment were granted declare that the firm had within two years last past made unlawful conversion of its funds and payments , to the amount of over $100,000 , to Samuel Levy of Prankford . Germany , now , but formerly of this city a brother of Augustus H. and Moses S. Levy , and that such payments were made - with the intent to defraud the creditors of the firm and to deprive them of the payment of their just dues . The affidavits also set fotth that the firm , in a statement made to the National Park Bank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300,000 , and that an investigation of the condition of the firm , made within the last three days , showed an excess of liabilities over apparent assets of over $350,000 , making an apparent deficit within less than six months of over $650,000 . Mr. Otto Horwitz of Horwitz &; Hershfield , attorneys for the Park National Bank , said last night : " The firm is the same one which , under the name of Levy Brothers &; Co. , failed in 1883 for $2,225,000 ; only Samuel Levy was at that time a partner , and Moses S. Levy was a traveling salesman in the employ of the firm , not interested as a partner . The failure in 1883. was precipitated by the failure of F. Mayer &; Co. , with whom they were intimately connected . Mayer &; Co. ' s failure was exceedingly disastrous . Their liabilities were over $2,500,000 , and , excepting my clients , on whose application their assignment was set aside , none of the creditors got a cent . Levy Brothers &; Co. were creditors to a very large amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conduct on that trying occasion was such as to gain them the confidence of the commercial community , and that enabled them to reorganize and go on with the business . " They paid the majority of their creditors in full and settled with the rest at fifty cents on the dollar , partial payments . On the reorganization of the firm Samuel Levy went out , but con , tinned to reside in this city until about six months ago , when ho went to Europe . He is an utterly irresponsible party . Julius and Augustus II . Levy constituted the new firm until the 1st of January of this year , when they took young Moses S. Levy , who had been a successful salesman , into partnership . I am satisfied that young Mr. Levy was altogether ignorant of the condition of the firm and of what was going on , and is rather to be pitied than condemned for his unfortunate connection with the affair . Ile was married only a short time ago . " The firm say now that their trouble is partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liabilities of the old firm , which they assumed when they resumed business in 1883 ; but they took the assets of the old firm and for years have represented that all that old indebtedness has been paid of and that out of the large business they had since transacted they had cleaned up o ver $350 , 000 surplus , which was invested in the business . It was on the strength of this statement that my client , the National Park Bank , discounted their paper to the amount of nearly/$100,000 . Of course , the bank had collaterals , which were represented to be customers ' bills and notes , but upon investigation I find these to consist largely of accommodation paper and to be largely worthless . " The firm was slow pay , and when I discovered the faulty character of the collateral/5 I instituted an investigation , which disclosed the fraudulent payments to Samuel Levy . I denanded an explanation of them and none was given . This was on Saturday . Shortly after I left the office , I am informed , Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he was restored to consciousness acted queerly , seeming to be unable to recognize his partners or any of the employes . He was taken home in a carriage and was unable to recognize any of his family . The family physician was summoned , and by his orders Mr. Levy was closely watched and attended until this morning without any apparent change in his condition . This morning three of the best-known experts on diseases of the mind met in consultation on his case , and have decided that he is hopelessly , incurably insane . The case is a sad one , for he has a wife and five or six children . He stood very high in business and social circles , and until this sad affair had the esteem and respect of all who knew him . The failure will be a disastrous one , I am afraid ; the liabilities will be at least $750,000 and may reach a million or more , and I do n't believe the assets will realize even half a million . The fact that they are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an amicable settlement of the firm 's troubles . In fact , I look for a general scramble of the rest of the creditors to-morrow to get in first with their writs of attachment in order to secure priority of payment out of what may be left when the claims of the attachment creditors up to to-night are paid " No steps toward an assignment have yet been taken to my knowledge , and Julius Levy , the responsible head of the firm , is acting as if he was satisfied to let matters take any course they may . It would be the fair thing for him , of course , to make an assignment before any more attachments are levied . " As to the firm 's relations with other manufacturing or mercantile bodies I am not thoroughly informed . There are some out-of-town connections which may be seriously affected by the failure  --  some parties whose paper the firm ' has discounted , and for considerable amounts . If they should be required to take up all their paper at once ,      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
