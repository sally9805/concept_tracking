A SECOND VISIT TO PARIS . company was Still engaged for the whole month of *une , and I wished to take advantage of the opportunity to appear four times at Venice . The Princess Margherita of Savoy , now our beloved queen , was at Venice for the sea-bathing , and was present at all my performances . I preserve preciously a beautiful souvenir which she was good enough to send me . From Venice I returned to Florence , and again took up my wanderings with different actors and actresses . I opened at Paris , October 3 , x8* ' 7 , in the Salle Ventadour ; of all that I played there , to the " Morte Civile " was adjudged the palm . It was a real revelation to the Parisians . It would be tedious to repeat all that the greatest artistic and literary luminaries wrote of it . Victor Hugo , La Pommeraye , Zola , Gautier , Vitu , elevated to the stars both composition and interpretation . The celebrated dramatic critic Vitu even made a translation of it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not " Othello , " not " Macbeth , " not " Ingomar , " nothing aroused such interest as Paolo Giacometti 's drama . After three nights at Antwerp , six at Brussels , and two at Lille , I went back to Paris for eleven more , five of which were devoted to the " Morte Civile . " ESTIMATE OF MOUNET-SULLY . IN Paris I had the opportunity to know the famous Mounet-Sully , whom I admired much in Victor Hugo 's " Hernani , " and to whom I permitted myself to make a small criticism on his highly artistic and meritorious performance  --  a criticism of the justice of which he was fully convinced . It is only conscientious artists who are able to recognize their own defects . I found in Mounet-Sully too much nervousness ; he was always dn the stretch , continuously in forced action , as if something might break at any moment . He was a man of fine presence , of most accurate delivery , and if he could have freed himself from the traditions imposed upon him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who adopt the serious style are subjected ,  --  it would have aided him to be less conventional . He is to-day one of the most solid pillars of the Maison de Moli*re , and that is not a little thing . SARAH BERNHARDT . ONE night when I went on the stage to see Mounet-Sully he presented me to Mine . Sarah Bernhardt . I had never heard that excellent artist except as Dofia Sol in " Hernani . " I was entirely satisfied with her physical and vocal gifts , as well as with her incisive and penetrating diction , but it seemed to me that her movements were a little angular . I saw her another time in the " Dame aux Cam6lias , " and she was attractive in the earlier acts , both from her " voice of gold , " as the French style it , and from the naturalism with which she molded the character . At some points I noted a little precipitation in her delivery , the reason for which I had not observed in Victor Hugo 's verses ; and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modulating the various expressions of the voice , for so accentuating her phrases as to give them brilliancy , and for making herself up with that attractiveness which is , perhaps , peculiar to French actresses , yet I could not help noticing , especially in the last act of that play , a seeking after effects that were discordant with the position and character of the personage . I saw her afterward at Florence in Sardou 's " La Tosca , " and in that play she produced the same effect on me . She has very great gifts , an exceptional artistic quality , and notable defects . When I went through Paris on my last return from North America , I saw her in " Jeanne d'Arc . " I am not blind to the fascinating merits of that eccentric actress , and I proclaim her the brightest star which has in recent years risen above the horizon of dramatic art ; but I ask , is the superiority attributed to her by the world all pure gold ? Is there not in it a taint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acuteness of her interpretation , her moving and harmonious voice , the just accentuation of her phrasing , the tastefulness of her dress - all this is gold , pure gold . A slight tendency to declamation , a use of gesticulation not always appropriate , a marked precipitation of speech , especially at critical moments , and a pronounced monotony in pathetic expression , constitute the alloy . So much has been , and 927 // is still , said of the extravagances of that original genius , that wherever she goes no one will stay away from seeing her . It must , however , be admitted that all these advertisements draw more attention to the woman than to the actress . cOQUELIN . I MUST give , too , my impression of another celebrated French artist , an impression which is highly favorable to him , yet not without a " but , " for which he will bear me no grudge . He is the cleverest , the most exact , the most delicate , the most keen in his delivery of a monologue , that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refer to the elder Coquelin . How subtle and bright is the intelligence which this actor brings into play to give life to his delivery ! With how artistic a touch he colors every period , every phrase ! In how just a measure he balances his effects , so insinuating his humorous anecdotes that one would fancy they were told by many persons and not by himself alone ! The variety of his voice , the mobility of his face , are powerful auxiliaries which he uses with studied art ; he is never vulgar , never artificial , never monotonous , never incorrect . If this almost perfect artist could disabuse himself in the matter of playing a few parts which are not adapted either to his natural tendencies or to his characteristic face , if he would confine himself to such typical characters as do not have to support the responsibility of the entire play , in my opinion he would heighten his fame . When one does everything , one does too much , and can with difficulty attain to perfection . For that matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen but rare exceptions . THE FRENCH PUBLIC . WHAT can I say of the French public ? Has it a taste of its own , an independent judgment ? I doubt it . Those ten , twenty , and thirty men of superior intelligence who never miss a first night , whether of music or drama , guide and lead after them the mass of the audience . Would the claque with its paid applause ever have become established in France if the public had an opinion of its own ? And if it had such an opinion , would it submit to the imposition of judgment . upon it ? It is very true that if the play or the actor is not in touch with the audience , the claque has not the power to force it to return and see the same play , but it serves , nevertheless , to modify any distaste on the part of the public . In Italy it could have no other effect than to make the public still more hostile to a play . One can never obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French public . If the thirty intelligent persons do not approve , the mass will remain indifferent . And just so is it with the press . If the papers favor a play , they have much influence on public opinion , they incite the people to fill the theater , and the audience , whether it will or no , is persuaded that it has been amused . If the censors are unfavorable , the house will stay empty . Hence it results that it is never the public which decides , but the thirty assiduous men of intelligence who render the verdict , and the press which condemns or applauds . When I was again in Florence , I lived quietly and happily with my wife , whom I could not take with me on my professional tours , since she was obliged to attend to our family affairs , and to care as well for her own health . During the summer I busied myself with my garden and vineyard on my small property near Florence . At the end of October , 1879 , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 13 our second child was born , after which event my wife was taken with an obstinate fever ; then inflammation set in , and finally scarlet fever , which in her enfeebled condition did not break out openly , but none the less accomplished its maleficent work . After a month of suffering under this accumulation of ills , a violent attack of peritonitis developed , and the poor creature , worn out , lost her reason and then her life , leaving me two little babies as memorials of our love . I can not describe my anguish of mind . The world imagines that the artist wraps up all his aspirations in his own self-love . It is indeed true that that satisfaction appeals to the mind , but it can not compensate for the tortures of the heart . Not to have known my mother , who died when I was two years old ; to have lost my father at fifteen ; to have seen waste away , still young , the woman who first inspired me with deep affection ; to have been bereaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally to see a brother die upon whom I had counted as the friend of my old age-all this I have endured . Truly those who have no feelings are most happy ! A TOUR OF EASTERN EUROPE . LEFT alone by the death of my wife , with my well-grown sons at school , and my last children too young to give me any consolation , I threw myself with renewed ardor into the embrace of art , resolved to seek no other distraction , but to look for relief and oblivion in unwearied study , in practice on the stage , in continuous traveling ; but throughout four years it was impossible for me to forget my misfortune . All that was not connected with my art // was repulsive to me : to new acquaintanceships I was indifferent ; traveling did not cheer me ; and even in the exercise of my profession the dominating recollection of the irreparable loss I had suffered remained fixed in my mind . On November ii , 1879 , I again started out , this time for Trieste , whence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pesth , I went on to the cosmopolitan city of Russia , Odessa . There everybody has a more or less complete knowledge of Italian , and I had a festive greeting from the heterogeneous population . I remained in Odessa from January 15 to February 20 , i88o , and then went to Roumania , where I first appeared on February 23 . I played six times at Jassy , three times at Galatz , twice at Braila , and finally , on March 20,1 proceeded to the capital , and stayed there until April is . I was so well received by the people and their rulers , that the Prince , now King Charles I. , honored me with the Star of Roumania . The scholarly Princess , now Queen Pauline Elizabeth ( " Carmen Sylva " ) , showed me the greatest kindness and courtesy . She had the kindness to read to me one of her poetical works , written in French , which seemed to me full of dash and interest , and elegant in form . I shall always retain an agreeable memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucharest I played three times at Cracow , and on April 20 left Roumania to return to Florence , in order to take breath for my future peregrinations . TRAGEDY IN TWO LANGUAGES . IN this year the agent of an impresario and theater-owner of Boston came to Florence to make me the proposal that I should go to North America for the second time , to play in Italian supported by an American company . I thought the man had lost his senses . But after a time I became convinced that he was in his right mind , and that no one would undertake a long and costly journey simply to play a joke , and I took his extraordinary proposition into serious consideration , and asked him for explanations . " The idea is this , " the agent made answer ; " it is very simple . You found favor the last time with the American public with your Italian company , when not a word that was said was understood , and the proprietor of the Globe Theater of Boston thinks that if he puts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since all the dialogue of your supporters will be plain . The audience will concern itself only with following you , with the aid ofthe play-books inboth languages , and will not have to pay attention to the others , whose words it will understand . " " But how shall I take my cue , since I do not understand English ? And how will your American actors know when to speak , since they do not know Italian ? " " Have no anxiety about that , " said the agent . " Our American actors are mathematicians , and can memorize perfectly the last words of your speeches , and they will work with the precision of machines . " " I amreadytoadmitthat , " said I , " although I do not think it will be so easy ; but it will in any case be much easier for them , who will have to deal with me alone , and will divide the difficulty among twenty or twenty-four , than for me , who must take care of all . " The persevering agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do not sign yourself Salvini ' for nothing ! " He had an answer for everything , he was prepared to convince me at all points , to persuade me about eyerything , and to smooth over every difficulty , and he won a consent which , though almost involuntary on my part , was legalized by a contract in due form , by which I undertook to be at New York not later than November r* , i88o , and to be ready to open at Philadelphia with " Othello " on the 29th of the same month . I was still dominated by my bereavement , and the thought was pleasant to me of going away from places which constantly brought it back to my mind . Another sky , other customs , another language , grave responsibilities , a novel and difficult undertaking of uncertain outcome-I was willing to risk all simply to distract my attention and to forget . I have never in my life been a gambler , but that time I staked my artistic reputation upon a single card . Failure would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , but still different from that which filled my mind . I played , and I won ! The friends whom I had made in the United States in 1873 , and with whom I had kept up my acquaintance , when they learned of the confusion of tongues , wrote me discouraging letters . In Italy the thing was not believed , so eccentric did it seem . I arrived in New York nervous and feverish , but not discouraged or depressed . When the day of the first rehearsal came , all the theaters were occupied , and I had to make the best of a rather large concert-hall to try to get into touch with the actors who were to support me . An Italian who was employed in a newspaper-office served me as interpreter in cooperation with the agent of my Boston impresario . The American artists began the rehearsal without a prompter , and with a sureness to be envied especially by our Italian actors , who usually must have every word suggested to them . My turn came , and the few words which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without difficulty . // When the scene with the Council of Ten came , of a sudden J could not recall the first line of a paragraph , and I hesitated ; I began a line , but it was not that ; I tried another with no better success ; a third , but the interpreter told me that I had gone wrong . We began again , but the English was of no assistance to me in recognizing which of my speeches corresponded to that addressed to me , which I did not understand . I was all at sea , and I told the interpreter to beg the actors to overlook my momentary confusion , and to say to them that I should be all right in five minutes . I went off to a corner of the hall and bowed my head between my hands , saying to myself , " I have come for this , and I must carry it through . " I set out to number mentally all the paragraphs of my part , and in a short time I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rehearsal one might have thought that I understood English , and that the American actors understood Italian . No further mistake was made by either side ; there was not even the smallest hesitation , and when I finished the final scene of the third act between 0/lie/to and Logo , the actors applauded , filled with joy and pleasure . The exactitude with which the subsequent rehearsals of " Othello , " and those of " Hamlet , " proceeded was due to the memory , the application , and the scrupulous attention to their work of the American actors , as well as to my own force of will and practical acquaintance with all the parts of the play , and to the natural intuition which helped me to know without understanding what was addressed to me , divining it from a motion , a look , or a light inflection of the voice . Gradually a few words , a few short phrases , remained in my ear , and in course of time I came to understand perfectly every word of all the characters ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word for another I perceived it . I understood the words of Shakspere , but not those of the spoken language . In a few days we went to Philadelphia to begin our representations . My old acquaintances were in despair . To those who had sought to discourage me by their letters others on the spot joined their influence , and tried everything to overthrow my courage . I must admit that the nearer came the hour of the great experiment , the more my anxiety grew and inclined me to deplore the moment when I had put myself in that dilemma . I owe it in a great degree to my cool head that my discouraging forebodings did not unman me so much as to make me abandon myself wholly to despair . Jusi as I was going on the stage , I said to myself : " After all , what can happen to me ? They will not murder me . I shall have tried , and I shall have failed ; that is all there will be to it . I will pack up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wine will not mix . " A certain contempt of danger , a firm resolution to succeed , and , I am bound to add , considerable confidence in myself , enabled me to go before the public calm , bold , and secure . The first scene before the palace of Bra ban/io was received with sepulchral silence . When that of the Council of Ten came , and the narration of the vicissitudes of 0/hello was ended , the public broke forth in prolonged applause . Then I said to myself " A good beginning is half the work . " At the close of the first act , my adversaries , who were such solely on account of their love of art , and their belief that the two languages could not be amalgamated , came on the stage to embrace and congratulate me , surprised , enchanted , enthusiastic , happy that they had been mistaken , and throughout the play I was the object of constant demonstrations of sympathy . AMERICAN CRITICAL TASTE . FROM Philadelphia we went to New York , where our success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suifrages of Boston , and I secured them , first having made stops in Brooklyn , New Haven , and Hartford . When in the American Athens I became convinced that that city possesses the most refined artistic taste . The theatrical audiences are serious , attentive to details , analytical ,  --  I might almost say scientific ,  - -  and one might fancy that such careful critics had never in their lives done anything but occupy themselves with scenic art . With reference to a presentation of Shakspere , they are profound , acute , subtile , and they know so well how to clothe some traditional principle in close logic , that if faith in the opposite is not quite unshakable in an artist , he must feel himself tempted to renounce his own tenets . It is surprising that in a land where industry and commerce seem to absorb all the intelligence of the people , there should be in every city and district , indeed in every village , people who are competent to discuss the arts with such high authority . The American nation counts only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men of high competence in dramatic art . Those who think of tempting fortune by displaying their untried artistic gifts on the American stage , counting on the ignorance or inexperience of their audience , make a very unsafe calculation . The taste and critical faculty of that public are in their fullness of vigor . Old Europe is more bound by traditions , more weary , more blase* , in her judgment , not always sincere or disinterested . In America the national pride is waimly felt , // and the national artists enjoy high honor . The Americans know how to offer an exquisite hospitality , but woe to the man who seeks to impose on them ! They profess a cult , a veneration , for those who practise our art , whether of their own nation or foreign , and their behavior in the theater is dignified . I recall one night when upon invitation I went to see a new play in which appeared an actor of reputation . The play was not liked , and from act to act I noticed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose which loses its petals one by one , until at the last scene my box was the only one which remained occupied . I was more impressed by this silent demonstration of hostility than I should have been if the audience had made a tumultuous expression of its disapproval . The actors were humiliated and confounded , and as the curtain fell an instinctive sentiment of compassion induced me to applaud . To return to my tour . From Boston I went to Montreal and Toronto , thence to Cincinnati for a week , and again to New York for a fortnight . I think that all my dramatic colleagues will agree with me that the life of an actor in America is extremely wearing . The system obtains everywhere of opening the theaters every night , and I can not blame the owners from the point of view of their own interests ; for since they hire their watchmen and attendants by the year , they must pay their salaries whether their houses are open or closed . They are therefore constrained to impose similar conditions upon the managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Sunday , and in some States even on that day , and on one or two days of the week they must play twice . Think of an artist , all of whose repertory is made up of tragedies of Shakspere , and tell me whether it is possible that human strength can resist such a strain . Admitting that one 's nerves may be elastic enough to endure it , one can not control the vocal organs ; and after a few weeks of such exaggerated effort , the actor 's strength and vocal faculty diminish , and the later representations seem pale and without the life and fire required for the best results . I always held back from submitting myself to this imposition ; I was never willing to play more than four or at the most five times a week , and even to the injury of my immediate interests I would never depart from this resolution . There may have been actors able to support the burden more easily , but I know , though endowed with muscles of steel , sound hgalth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know well that to keep a machine in good running order , there must be time to keep it always polished and oiled ; with this precaution , even after fifty years of activity , it will not show a trace of rust , and will still be in condition to perform its regular functions . In so long a period my machine was forced to stop only twice ; and both times , after the damage was repaired ,  --  damage which resulted not from imprudence , but from unforeseen accidents ,  --  it began runmng again as efficiently as before . I continued my peregrinations to Albany , Buffalo , Detroit , and Chicago , and other cities in the West and South . A VISIT TO THE CAPITAL . AT last we proceeded to the capital of the United States . Washington is a very attractive city , with superb edifices , wide and well-paved streets , beautiful shops , and a population of most agreeable quality . It is safe to say that , after those of Boston , the theater audiences there are the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , of the different States , with their families , form an important contingent of intelligence beyond the average . In that city I had an experience worth relating . With an acquaintance who spoke Italian and English I went one day to visit the Capitol . When we had entered the majestic structure , and were walking through the offices , the corridors , and the private rooms of the committees , I noticed that I was an object of curiosity to the many people whom I met . After half an hour spent in visiting the labyrinth of halls and galleries , a gentleman presented himself to me as a member of the House , and invited me in the name of the Speaker to visit the House of Representatives . I tried to excuse myself on the ground of my modest morning-dress , but the gentleman who invited me observed that this question of dress was little attended to in America , and I yielded to his arguments and to those of the friend who was with me , and presented myself before the Speaker . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members present . After a few very courteous words , he gave me permission to visit the hall of the House , and as I passed through the corridors between the lines of seats all the members advanced from right and left to shake hands with me . When I reached the back of the great hall a crowd of the pages of the House , dressed in uniform , surrounded me with little note-books in their hands , belonging to the congressmen , and asked for my autograph . I had to write my name two hundred and seventy-eight times ; and , luckily for me , the attendance that day was not large ! My hand became cramped with so many signatures , and Heaven knows what my calligraphy became before I finished . // IMPRESSIONS OF EDWIN BOOTH . THE celebrated actor Edwin Booth was at this time in Baltimore , a city distant two hours from the capital . I had heard so much about this superior artist that I was anxious to see him , and on one of my off nights I went to Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved for me without my knowledge , and was draped with the Italian colors . I regretted to be made so conspicuous , but I could not fail to appreciate the courteous and complimentary desire to do me honor shown by the American artist . It was only natural that I should be most kindly influenced toward him , but without the courtesy which predisposed me in his favor he would equally have won my sympathy by his attractive and artistic lineaments , and his graceful and well-proportioned figure . The play was " Hamlet . " This part brought him great fame , and justly ; for in addition to the high artistic worth with which he adorned it , his elegant personality was admirably adapted to it . His long and wavy hair , his large and expressive eye , his youthful and flexible movements , accorded perfectly with the ideal of the young prince of Denmark which now obtains everywhere . His splendid delivery , and the penetrating philosophy with which he informed his phrases , were his most remarkable qualities . I was so fortunate as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three of these parts , so diverse in their character , I found him absolutely admirable . I can not say so much for his Macbe/h , which I saw one night when passing through Philadelphia . The part seemed to me not adapted to his nature . Macbc/h was an ambitious man , and Booth was not . Macbe//i had barbarous and ferocious instincts , and Booth was agreeable , urbane , and courteous . llfacbe/k destroyed his enemies traitorously - did this even to gain possession of their goods - while Booth was noble , lofty-minded , and generous of his wealth . It is thus plain that however much art he might expend , his nature rebelled against his portrayal of that personage , and he could never hope to transform himself into the ambitious , venal , and sanguinary Scottish king . I should say , from what I heard in America , that Edwin Forrest was the Modena of America . The memory of that actor still lives , for no one has possessed equally the power to give expression to the passions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he possessed astonishing power of voice . Almost contemporaneously a number of most estimable actors haveJaid claim to his mantle ; but above them all Edwin Booth soared as an eagle . After a very satisfactory experience in Baltimore , I returned for the third time to New York , and gave " Othello , " " Macbeth , " and the " Gladiator , " each play twice , and made the last two appearances of my season in Philadelphia . After playing ninety-five times in the new fashion , I felt myself worn out , but fully satisfied with the result of my venturesome undertaking . When I embarked on the steamer which was to take me to Europe , I was escorted by all the artists of the company which had cooperated in my happy success , by my friends , and by courteous admirers , and I felt that if I were not an Italian I should wish to be an American . IN EGYPT . AT the end of May , i88i , I landed at Havre , and went on to Paris , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , for in that city it is not easy to do nothing . I did not fail to frequent the Com6die Fran9aise to hear some of those excellent society comedies which are played there with so much taste , delicacy , and truth ; and after having myself recited such a vast quantity of verse during seven months , that pure and beautiful prose appeared to me a most savory change , seasoned as it was with the most delicate sauces and spices by the most expert of cooks . When I reached Florence my first thought was to retire at once to my country house , to enjoy that calm which one can not find except at home and in the bosom of his family . However , offers of new theatrical enterprises came to disturb my repose , and I was constrained to accept a proposition that I should go to Egypt for the months of December , i88i , and January , 1882 . I formed , for these two months only , an Italian company , and on December 3 I opened in Alexandria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is necessary to change the play every night ; so besides my accustomed tragedies I gave dramas and comedies , as for example " Le Lapidaire , " by Alexandre Dumas ; " Fasma , " by Dall ' Ongaro ; " La Calomnie , " by Scribe ; and " La Suonatrice d'Arpa , " by Chiossone . I need not say how much pleasure the people of Alexandria took in these plays . The Italian colony overwhelmed me with generous demonstrations , and the Boat Club invited me to name after myself a new acquisition of their navy-not , it is true , a 9uilio . After playing fourteen times in Alexandria , we went to Cairo , and I lost no time in visiting those tremendous monuments the Pyramids , glorious and imposing relics of a greatness the idea of which we can not now even conceive . RECEPTION IN RUSSIA . AT the end of January I went back to Italy* and was invited to go to Russia . I got to- // gether fresh actors and actresses , and on February 24 , 1882 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater in St. Petersburg . I thus passed quickly from a land of suffocating heat to one of bitter cold , but changes oftemperature have never affected me much . I confess that when I first entered that empire I felt a vague apprehension , the cause of which I did not fully explain to myself . I had been invited by the Direction of the Imperial Theaters , I came in the quality of a foreign artist , and no harm could possibly come to me ; nevertheless , after the vexations inflicted by the customs officers at the Russian frontier on the members of my company , an indescribable disgust developed in my mind . My imagination is naturally fervid , and in my fancy I saw the poor exiles in Siberia , the knout administered in the public streets to disrespectful subjects , the tortures of the prisons , the summary confiscations of the property of the suspected , the arrogance of the soldiery , the extreme rigor of the laws , the servile obsequiousness obligatory toward the Czar , the despotism of the great , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me so dark as in fact to be wholly black . The Nihilists had only a little before laid their inexorable hand on their prey , and all were still palpitating with the tragic end of the Emperor Alexander II . You can imagine how the Gov-. eminent stood to its arms , and how the people constantly trembled with dread . The theater was a permitted and innocent distraction , and there , freed from fear , and laying aside the perturbation of politics , the public worked off its excitement in clamorous enthusiasm , sometimes to the point of disturbing the course of the play and disconcerting the unlucky actor . I have never had experience with a public so systematically persistent in applause as the Russian . After the artist has gone through a very fatiguing part , and , panting , prostrated , in a bath of perspiration , hopes to be able to retire to his room to rest , he is obliged to stand for a full half-hour , exhausted and perspiring as he is , to receive the interminable ovations of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty , or even thirty times . Not content with that , they wait for you at the door , no matter how long you take to dress , and stand in lines for you to pass between , begging a look or a touch of your hand ; and if you live so near by as not to need a carriage , they accompany you on foot to the door of your lodgings , with open manifestations of sympathy . The Russian is courteous , hospitable , liberal to the actor ; but , like all those whose enthusiasm exceeds due bounds , he forgets easily . There have been but very few native artists of celebrity . On the other hand , the Imperial companies , which play only in St. Petersburg and Moscow , are meritorious , and distinguished for the smoothness of their representations . In the secondary cities the artistic contingent is of wretched quality , and may be compared with the lowest ranks of our own - the socalled gui//i ; but the Russian public , particularly in the provinces , is amiable , tolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind , to accept an alloy for the pure metal . I made twenty appearances at St. Petersburg in thirtyeight days , and then went to Moscow , where I gave eleven more performances . At Moscow the public seemed to be much calmer , and , moreover , our houses were much better . In both cities splendid gifts were made me , which I preserve as pleasant remembrances of an enjoyable experience . By the end of April , 1882 , I was again resting in Florence . STUDY OF " KING LEAR . " AFTER having given due attention to the interests of my family , and fulfilled my social obligations , I employed my time in polishing my study of Shakspere 's King Lear and overcoming some difficulties which that character presented to me , with the intention of bringing it out in the United States , whither I had arranged to go in the beginning of October . My work on that play preoccupied me greatly , and although I had brought it out in a preliminary appearance at the Teatro Salvini , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not feel entirely satisfied with myself , and I proposed to combat my difficulties deliberately and seriously . I wished to find the way to make some scenes more effective , while maintaining the character in its proper relations . It was necessary to devise means for producing effects with auxiliaries different from those to which I had been accustomed , to move and interest the audience by creating new combinations and contrasts , and by conjuring up a type of sentiment in accord with the character and the age of that grandiose personage . I do not know whether I was successful , but the greeting of the public gave me assurance that I made at least some approach to my object . I was thus provided with a new play for my third venture in the United States . I played 109 times in this season as against *5 the time before ; moreover , the last sixteen representations of the " Morte Civile " were most lucratiye , since I gave them in company with the famous actress Clara Morris . It is right that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could not wish for a better interpreter of the part of Roscilia in the drama I have named . This season was also more brilliant than the one before it , because the rumor // had spread that I would not come again to North America  --  a baseless and absurd rumor , since the financial results were rather such as to encourage me to cross the ocean again , as in fact they did . The public was , however , so fully persuaded of the sincerity of my alleged resolution , that several gentlemen associated themselves to offer me a banquet at the Brunswick Hotel , at which all classes of New York society were represented . The distinguished German actor Bamay , who was then in New York , came to the banquet after his play , and made a speech full of kindly encomium , which aroused sincere enthusiasm . I again recrossed the ocean , not to rest , as I might perhaps have been excused for doing , after so many and continuous fatigues , but to study the part of Coriolanus in proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always looked upon as my second mother . If in the vicissitudes of my life I had not had this recourse , I do not know what would have become of me . Art has always received me , restored me , protected me ; and if it has not been able to make me forget my misfortunes altogether , it has mitigated them . I owe to it my moments of comfort , satisfaction , and joy , and now that I am constrained to abandon it , I do not weep , for I have never been weak ; but my heart feels the sting of bitterness . While I was occupying myself with the character of that impetuous but valorous warrior , it was proposed to me to go to Rome and Trieste , and to play a few times in Florence . My fello w-citizens never evinced more affection and admiration for me than upon this occasion . At Rome my nine appearances were greeted with hearty interest and enthusiasm . At Florence the theater was never large enough to receive those who wished to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same company went with me for a season at Covent Garden , London . The time of the year was not propitious . At the end of February there were very thick fogs accompanying a humid and cold atmosphere , and the heating arrangements of the theater were so defective that it seemed like playing in an ice-house . I remember that on the night when I played the " Gjadiator , " in the fourth act , when I had to fight in the arena with nothing but silken tights on my body , before I went on my teeth chattered with cold . At the end of that very fatiguing act the perspiration rolled from me as in a Turkish bath , and when I reached my dressingroom a heavy chill came over me , from the effects of which I suffered long . The audience sat in their overcoats and furs , the men with their colk&amp;rs turned up , and the women with their heads wrapped in shawls and hoods . Our season had opened with excellent promise , but whatever may have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay away in such weather for fear of illness . I made urgent complaints to my impresario , but the evil was irremediable . After twenty-one nights of " Othello , " " King Lear , " " Macbeth , " the " Gladiator , " and " Hamlet , " we proceeded to Edinburgh , and the weather having become milder , our business again rose to its regular level . Our tour included the cities of Glasgow , Manchester , Newcastle , Birmingham , Brighton , and Dublin , and closed with a farewell representation of " Othello " in London . cORIOLANUs . IT being out of the question to remain in London , the only city in which a summer season is possible , I proposed to my company that they should continue at my disposition at half salary from the end of May until November i of that year ( 1884 ) , proposing again to go on the road at the latter date . They agreed ; and on November 4 we began a series of nine representations at Naples , whence we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ended the year , resolved to confine myself for the immediate future to the study of the banished and vindictive hero Coriolcinus . I felt that I could divine that character , which resembled my own in some ways-not , certainly , in his warlike exploits , but in his susceptibility , in his spurning of the arrogance and insolent pretensions of the ignorant masses , and , above all , in his filial submissiveness and affection . Unfortunately , I was not able to submit the results of this study to the judgment of the Italian public , as I have done with all my others , since it demands too costly a stage setting , and it was impossible to secure in the great number of assistants necessary that artistic discipline without which the grandiose easily merges in the ridiculous . I regretted this much , as my compatriots would have given me an unbiased and intellectual judgment of the work ; but for the reasons I have stated I reconciled myself to giving it for the first time at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragedy . This , as my reader will not need to be told , was the fourth time that I went before the American public , on three of which times I was supported by an English-speaking company . The close of my artistic career approaches , and with it the end of the anecdotes with which it has been diversified . The chief object of these memoirs is to make it known to any one whom it may aid how a young man , without inherited resources , and constrained to look out for himself from very early years , can by upright conduct , firm resolution , and assiduous effort // acquire in time some renown , and the means for enjoying the comforts of life in his old age without being dependent on anybody . Those who meet with misfortune o*ving to too little application to study , or to pretensions out of proportion to their deserts , deserve indulgence indeed , but not compassion . If my example can be of utility to those who are born with artistic instincts , I shall have the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Moralizing is now out of fashion , but an example still receives attention , and may be of service . Art is pure , loyal , honorable , uncontaminated . Through these virtues it exacts , commands , imposes morality upon whomsoever places himself under its *gis , and it rejects , condemns , and punishes him who fails to respect it . It is for this reason that great artists , with rare exceptions , are moral and honorable . A LUDiCROUS APPEARANCE IN KHARKOv . BEFORE telling of my fourth visit to North America , I must narrate a rather strange experience which I had in the spring of 1885 . A lady ( I say lady to distinguish the sex ) made me an offer to play in Little Russia with native actors . My knowledge of all foreign languages is extremely limited , but of Russian I do not know a single word . I informed my would-be impresario of this difficulty , and she diminished my hesitation by writing me that Italian was more or less familiar to all in those regions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the actors . would do their best to cooperate with me ; and she added that she would provide two prompters speaking the two languages . Persistence sometimes overcomes even avarice , and I allowed myself to be seduced by her pressing arguments . I went to Kharkov , where the company was assembled , and I was scandalized to behold a theater entirely of wood , old , ruinous , and littered with the dirt of a century , which was enough to make me shiver . The actors , except the leading lady , who could recognize French by sight , did not understand a word outside of their own tongue ; there were indeed two prompters , but the Russian knew no Italian , and the Italian no Russian . At the rehearsals the two prompters made a conventional sign to each other to call the attention of the one upon whom it was incumbent to speak . The actors , who were Russian provincials , seemed not to be in the habit of committing their parts to memory , for even at the last rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lines . The unhappy prompter had to repeat a phrase two and three times to get the actor to take it , *nd you can imagine what smoothness this system produced in the representation . I am naturally patient , and I sought to inculcate into this band of mountebanks the advantages of more study , more exactness , more attention , and I sought to furnish them with an example by never giving the Italian prompter occasion to speak ; but it profited nothing . The public representation began , and the audience , accustomed to that system of acting , was not at all disturbed by it , but seemed to look upon it as a surprising phenomenon that , while the murmur of the prompter formed a constant accompaniment to the words of the other actors , when I spoke the murmur ceased . It seemed , too , that little attention was given to exactness in costume , for I noticed that Brabantia in " Othello " wore short breeches and shoes with buckles , like a priest . In the " Gladiator , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage in trunk-hose and short Spanish cloak of the time of Philip II . You can picture to yourself what the scenery , furniture , and accessories must have been . But the people did not complain , and did not even criticize . In their eyes everything was admirable , and they gave vent to the most exaggerated enthusiasm . During the rehearsals the prompters occupied stools , one on each side of the stage , but during the public performances both crowded into the little prompter 's box , which was covered with a hood of pasteboard . On the first night I was so much preoccupied that I thought of nothing that did not concern the course of the play itself but on the second I noticed those two unfortunates wedged in together , simply melting with perspiration , each with one arm out of the box holding the book of the play , and nudging each other at intervals to indicate whose turn it was to prompt ; and , thinking of the Siamese twins , such an impulse to laugh came upon me that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kharkov is large and of much importance , and , as was natural , the audiences were made up in large part of students . Every one knows the characteristics of that picked class of society , marked by energy , enthusiasm , goodness of heart , and generous tendencies , compounded with thoughtlessness and disorder . Especially in Russia , where the students are held in check by a rigorous Government , which suppresses every liberal aspiration , whenever an opportunity offers to give rein to excitement , the reaction follows , and unbridled demonstrations break out . I refer to this because one night I had experience of the consequences of this condition . I do not remember what the play was , but when I came out of the theater I found a real mob waiting for me , and with deafening shouts they lifted me in the air and carried me above their heads like a balloon to my carriage , into which they // threw me as if I were a rubber ball . I may remark that I weigh 250 pounds ! As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Whip up , driver ! " and the horses broke into a trot ; but the crowd ran behind the carriage shouting and clamoring , and from time to time I caught the words " Un souvenir ! " It was not easy for me to satisfy them at that moment , but a happy idea came to me . When I reached my hotel I remembered that I had in my portfolio a number of visitingcards . I took them all and threw them into the most fervent group of manifesters , and while these were busy picking up the cards , I had time to get out of my carriage and rush into the hotel , happy in my deliverance . The Russians are most lavish in their gifts , and I brought away many as remembrances of those regions , which I have not seen since . At Saratoy and at Taganrog there was no lack of demonstrations ; but as there were no students , enthusiasm did not become dangerous to life , as in Kharkov . We were to have gone on to Kazan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receipts , and to omit to pay the actors , who justly refused to keep on under these conditions . I gave a performance for their benefit , and took my departure , leaving that management of little faith the richer by several thousands of francs on my account also , but very glad , nevertheless , to get away from it . MISFORTUNES IN CALIFORNIA . FROM my journey to Russia I returned to Florence , to await the time of going to the United States , where the season opened , as usual , in the month of October . My first performances were in the new Metropolitan Opera House . There I first produced " Coriolanus , " and I was so happy as to meet with a flattering reception . After the usual tour through the chief cities , in February , i886 , we went to California . The weather was unusually severe . Along the line beyond Denver was erected an immense penthouse of wood , many miles long , to carry over the tracks the frequent avalanches from the mountains above . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my car before we reached the entrance of the snow-shed , and for more than half an hour I was compelled to breathe the damp cloud of smoke and steam , which was shut in by the shed and could not escape . I say I was forced to breathe it , because in the darkness and the dazed feeling produced by the dense and black atmosphere , and the undulation of the swiftly running train , I was afraid to move for fear of falfing on the rails . When we shot out into the light I was as drenched as if I had been ducked in a well , and I believe it is to this that I owe the complete loss of my voice after our first two or three performances in San Francisco ,  - -  a thing which in my whole career had never happened to me before . It was a most provoking accident . Everything promised us at the outset a splendid financial success ,  - -  my artistic success was won already ,  --  when the sudden closing of the theater , the uncertainty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaneous appearance of several new attractions , all united to divert the public from us , and we passed a week of interrupted profit and unlooked-for loss . I tried the most heroic and disagreeable remedies , but the disease would not be turned from its course , and we had to wait until my vocal organs could resume their sonority . While I lay in bed trying to get well , out of spirits , cross , and worried , not only for my own loss , but for that of my manager , a telegraphic despatch came from Florence to aggravate my trouble and grieve me sorely . My brother Alessandro was dead . This sad news pained and depressed me so greatly that when I returned to the stage , not fully cured , and afflicted bymy sudden loss , the public could not have formed a very favorable opinion of my artistic merit . Certainly I was not in condition to make the most of what I may have had . PLAYING WITH BOOTH . FROM California we returned to New York , where I had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwin Booth , to give three performances of " Othello " a week , with Booth as Zago and me as Othello . The cities selected were New York , Philadelphia , and Boston . As the managers had to hire the theaters by the week , they proposed that we should give " Hamlet " as a fourth performance , with Booth as Hamlet and me as the Ghost . I accepted with the greatest pleasure , flattered to be associated with so distinguished and sympathetic an artist . I can not find epithets to characterize those twelve performances ! The word " extraordinary " is not enough , nor is " splendid " ; I will call them " unique , " for I do not believe that any similar combination has ever aroused such interest in North America . To give some idea of it , I will say that the receipts for the twelve performances were $43,500 , an average of $3,625 a night . In Italy such receipts would be something phenomenal ; in America they were very satisfactory . During this time I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can characterize a gentleman . The affability and modesty of his manners rendered him justly loved and esteemed , not only by his countrymen , but by all who had the fortune to make his acquaintance . // For the performances I have described the bestknown artists who were then free were engaged ; and my son Alessandro played Cassio in " Othello " and Laertes in " Hamlet " with honor to himself , as he had also played with credit in more important parts in the course of my tour . This still youthful actor was endowed by nature with the gift of easily acquiring northern idioms . He was educated in German Switzerland , and had made a thorough study of German , which rendered the acquisition of English easy for him . I had sought to influence him in any other direction than that of the stage , but in a few months he ventured to present himself before the New York public in a lover 's part , in English , beside that able actress Clara Morris , and the verdict was encouraging . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could not be perceived that he was a foreigner . Nature bestowed upon this youth the material of an actor . He has a good presence , a fine voice , a vivid imagination , and a natural adaptability to diverse characters . In my opinion those best suited to him are the virile and energetic ; in the languid , amorous , and sentimental he does not seem to me so successful . FIFTH VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES . IN 1889 I accepted a fifth engagement for North America . The actor 's life in North America can be summed up in three words , " Theater , railroad , hotel . " Very few are the cities in which a stop of two or three weeks is made . Away from the large centers , sometimes theater and town are changed every night , with the intervening weariness of packing and of sleeping cars . And in addition there is the infliction of the reporters , to which you must submit , the thousands of autographs from which there is no relief , and the admirers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of such a season of seven months the actor is very eager to tear this shirt of Nessus from his back . But with all that , if I had been ten years younger I should have returned thither ten times more . One can endure in America what would not be endurable in Europe , and especially in Italy . I do not know whether this is due to the air , or to the material comforts of life , or whether it is that the example of industry animates , fortifies , and spurs one on : but it is certain that so continuous a strain in Europe would prostrate a man in a single year , while in America one undergoes it with resignation and resists it with courage . I will not deny that the anticipation of a satisfactory profit had some influence in maintaining my vitality , although my strongest incitement came from knowing that I was appreciated and loved . VOL . XLVI. - 121 . " SAMSON . " IN October , 1889 , then , I found myself again in North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described . This time , too , I was fortunate in the choice of a play which I had already given in the United States during my first visit in 1873 with the Italian company . After seventeen years " Samson " could be called new to the audiences who saw it . This play was put on the stage as a great spectacle . Scenery , furniture , costumes , accessories , all were made new for the occasion . The fall of the temple of Dagon was presented with so much realism that I feared every night that I should be crushed under one of those enormous blocks which fell on all sides of me . My son Alessandro had the stage management , and he took diligent precautions against a catastrophe . Nevertheless , one night a block of cornice rebounded , and gave me a bruise on the leg which lasted for several days . I was fortunate in having in the actress who played Delilah a most efficient coadjutress in the great success of that tragedy . During seven **37;51;TOOLONG " Othello , " " Samson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last month I added the " Morte Civile , " to be able to take a little breath , and played it as a rest . I gave " Othello " thirty-six times , " Samson " thirtyfive , the " Gladiator " twenty , and the " Morte Civile " twelve , in all one hundred and three performances , all requiring great expenditure of force . I need hardly say that , as always , the public showed me appreciation beyond my deserts . I realized , however , that I should not have the courage to make a sixth appearance in America under those inexorable conditions , and I resolved to announce my farewell to the American people in the papers , with expressien of my regret at taking my leave of them for the last time . No one would believe my declaration . People adduced the example of other artists , who have used this means to swell their audiences ; but to the honor of truth I can say that I never was under the necessity of having recourse to so puerile a subterfuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States by my fear of being no longer able to answer their expectation , for it had cost me too much to hide the extreme fatigue consequent on my performances during the season just expired . In former years , owing to my exuberant strength , every effort came spontaneously ; now I felt that , to attain the same effects , I must make a greater expenditure of energy . As I left that hospitable land behind , and saw the great Statue of Liberty fade gradually from my sight , I felt a pang in my soul , and if my eyes were dry , my heart wept . I // make a salute to that country whose people are so full of vigor , industry , and courage , and lack neither culture , nor understanding , nor feeling . May the United States receive the salutation of a humble artist , who while his heart beats will feel for that nation respect and love ! In returning to Europe the thought consoled me that I left in the land of Washington an offshoot of my blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can henceforth call himself half American ; and I am sure that with industry and unflinching will , besides winning general estimation for himself , he will keep alive beyond the ocean a sympathetic memory of me . In the mean time , thank God , he represents me worthily , and through him my name is still heard in America . AGO . IN 1890-91 Andrea Maggi 's company was at the Teatro Niccolini in Florence for the carnival season . Maggi had played the part of Othello in other cities , and every condition seemed to favor my taking that of fago in that theater , one of those of the highest repute in Italy . I accepted , and set to work to study , not the character , which was already impressed on my mind , but the mechanism of the words , a thing which for some little time had become difficult for me , owing to a defect of memory . It was much harder for me to commit exactly to memory the precise lines of the part of logo than to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . As to the last , the best way to arrive at many is to seek for none . This is not the place to make an analysis of the character ; I will only say that every one looks at it in his own way , and that I have already published my view of it . The " actor of the classic school , " as some impressionists call me , aimed to present an example of naturalness in delivery , while bringing into relief the poetic beauties of the part , and to effect this so that the verse form should not obscure truth ; and it is said that success was not lacking . With this interpretation I completed my trilogy of parts of the second rank , the others being La ; iciolfo in " Francesca da Rimini " and Pylades in " Oreste " ; and it was my purpose with these to demonstrate that even in an inferior part it is entirely possible to win the consideration of the public . It has always been my aim to overcome the difficulties of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more firmly I have set my mind upon conquering it . Not a few of the characters which I have played in the course of my long career have aroused bitter criticism , and yet have been well received by the public because my interpretation has been found accurate . Others have dated their success from some counsel of mine , which was based on experience , and for which the author has been grateful to me . Has the collection of the masterworks of art always found in me an interpreter of mirror-like truth ? No , I say . I have sought to the extent that my limited abilities have permitted to penetrate to my author 's ideal , but I have the conscience to confess that I have not always risen to the height of my own conception . I have never had a more severe critic than myself in matters pertaining to my art . As I myself look at it , my sentiment of blame is stronger than that of satisfaction .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
