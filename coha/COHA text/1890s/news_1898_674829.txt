txt Unmistakable signs of apprehension and nervousness were exhibited by the army officers who saw the bulletins to-day from Key West giving currency to ? the-report that fourSPaish men-ofWar had'attemPted to run the blockade into Havana .. The first question that arose was as to the identity of these ships , and more than one officer immediately recalled the fact that the department was still in some doubt as to the exact whereabouts of all of the Spanish warships , not only of Cervera 's fleet , but of others that had preceded it into West Indian waters . The naval officers made light of these fears , taking their stand on Sampson 's report that six Spanish warships were in : Santiago Harbor . They admitted that it would be no difficult task , for a warship to run the Havana blockade at this moment , weakened , as it has- been , by the : withdrawal of the fast and powerful ships for service at Santiago . It was recalled , too , that there were reports of recent date from Jamaica of very heavy gales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blinding tropical squalls for a vessel to escape detection while running a blockade . Still , the impression is general that if any Spanish warships really passed the blockade line they were little more than small gunboats  --  mere armed yachts  --  that are numerous along the bayous of the north Cuban coast . Without respect to the character of the strange craft that are said to be dodging the blockaders at Havana , they will be removed from the scene of action in short notice , as it is understood that Admiral Sampson has been made acquainted with the situation and will be expected to redeem his promise to provide safe conduct to the army when called upon . He has ample force to conduct the operations at Santiago to a successful issue and still spire vessels of any power desirable for use in the Florida Straits .
