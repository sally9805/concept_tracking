" They are really delicious  --  when properly treated . " How To Cook Husbands By ELIZABETH STRONG WORTHINGTON Author of " The Little Brown Dog " " The Biddy Club " Published at 220 East 23rd St. , New York by the Dodge Publishing Company COPYRIGHT IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT BY DODGE STATIONERY COMPANY Dedication To a dear little girl who will some day , I hope , be skilled in all branches of matrimonial cookery . I A while ago I came across a newspaper clipping  --  a recipe written by a Baltimore lady  --  that had long lain dormant in my desk . It ran as follows : " A great many husbands are spoiled by mismanagement . Some women go about it as if their husbands were bladders , and blow them up ; others keep them constantly in hot water ; others let them freeze , by their carelessness and indifference . Some keep them in a stew , by irritating ways and words ; others roast them ; some keep them in pickle all their lives . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , managed in this way  --  turnips would n't ; onions would n't ; cabbage-heads would n't , and husbands wo n't ; but they are really delicious when properly treated . " In selecting your husband you should not be guided by the silvery appearance , as in buying mackerel , or by the golden tint , as if you wanted salmon . Be sure to select him yourself , as taste differs . And by the way , do n't go to market for him , as the best are always brought to your door . " It is far better to have none , unless you patiently learn to cook him . A preserving kettle of the finest porcelain is the best , but if you have nothing but an earthenware pipkin , it will do , with care . " See that the linen , in which you wrap him , is nicely washed and mended , with the required amount of buttons and strings , nicely sewed on . Tie him in the kettle with a strong cord called Comfort , as the one called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the kettle , and become burned and crusty on the edges , since , like crabs and oysters , you have to cook them alive . " Make a clear , strong , steady fire out of Love , Neatness , and Cheerfulness . Set him as near this as seems to agree with him . If he sputters and fizzles , do n't be anxious ; some husbands do this till they are quite done . Add a little sugar , in the form of what confectioners call Kisses , but no vinegar or pepper on any account . A little spice improves them , but it must be used with judgment . " Do n't stick any sharp instrument into him , to see if he is becoming tender . Stir him gently ; watching the while lest he should lie too close to the kettle , and so become inert and useless . " You can not fail to know when he is done . If thus treated , you will find him very digestible , agreeing nicely with you and the children . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , " that is why we hear of such numbers of cases of marital indigestion  --  the husbands are served raw  --  fresh  --  unprepared . " " They are really delicious when properly treated , "  --  I wonder if that is so . But I must pause here to tell you a bit about myself . I am not an old maid , but , at the time this occurs , I am unmarried , and I am thirty-four years old  --  not quite beyond the pale of hope . Men and women never do pass beyond that  --  not those of sanguine temperament at any rate . I am neither rich nor poor , but repose in a comfortable stratum betwixt and between . I keep house , or rather it keeps me , and a respectable woman who , with her husband , manages my domestic affairs , lends the odor of sanctity and propriety to my single existence . I am of medium height , between blond and brunette , and am said to have a modicum of both brains and good looks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my library , before a big log fire . The room was comfortable ; glowing with rich , warm firelight at that moment , but it was lonesome , and I was lonely . Supposing , I said to myself , I really had a husband ; how should I cook him ? The words of an old lady came into my mind . She had listened to this particular recipe , and after a moment 's silence had leaned over , and whispered in my ear : " First catch your fish . " But supposing he were now caught , and seated in that rocker across from me , before this blazing fire . I walked to the window  --  to one side of me lives a little thrush , at least she is trim and comely , and always dresses in brown . Just now she is without her door , stooping over her baby , who is sitting like a tiny queen in her chariot , just returned from an airing . It is n't the question of husband alone  --  he might be managed  --  roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole family  --  a household . Take the children , for instance ; if they could be set up on shelves in glass cases , as fast as they came , all might be well , but they will run around , and Heaven only knows what they will run into . Why , had I children , I should plug both ears with cotton , for fear I should hear the door-bell . I know it would ring constantly , and such messages as these would be hurled in : " Several of them have been arrested for blowing up the neighbors with dynamite firecrackers . " " Half a dozen of them have tumbled from off the roof of the house . They escaped injury , but have thrown a nervous lady , over the way , into spasms . " " One or two of them have just been dragged from beneath the electric cars . They seem to be as well as ever , but three of the passengers died of fright . " Just think of that ! What should I do ? Keep an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three thousand dollars by me continually , to pay damages . What a time poor Job had of it answering his door bell , and how very unpleasant it must have been to receive so many pieces of news of that sort , in one morning ! Clearly I am better off in my childless condition , and yet  --   --  Little Mrs. Thrush is just kissing her soft , round-faced cherub . I wish she would do that out of sight . Now as to husbands again , if I had one , what should I do with him ? I might say , Sit down . Supposing he would n't . What then ? Cudgels are out of date . Were he an alderman , I might take a Woman 's Club to him , but a husband has been known to laugh this instrument to scorn . But supposing he sat down . What then ? He might be a gentleman of irascible , nasty temper , and in walking about my room , I might step on his feet . These irritable folk have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and always being stepped on no matter how careful one tries to be . What then ? I decline to contemplate the scene . Plainly I am better off single . I walk to my front window , and stretch my arms above my head . There is a light fall of snow upon the ground . This late snow is trying : in its season , it is beautiful ; but out of season , it breeds a cheerlessness that emphasises one 's loneliness . I look out through the leafless trees toward the lake , but it is hidden by the whirling , eddying snowflakes . I see Mr. Thrush hurrying home to his little nest . " Yes , " I say to myself , repeating my last thought with a certain obstinacy , " yes , I am better off without a husband , and yet I wish I had one  --  one would answer , on a pinch  --  one at a time , at least . A husband is like a world in that respect ; one at a time , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have none , unless you learn to cook him . " These words recurred to me , just as I was on the point of taking a life partner , in a figurative sense . The woman that deliberates is lost ; consequently , as it wo n't do to think the matter over , I plunge in . My spouse is now pacing up and down the room in a rampant manner , complaining of his dinner , the world in general , and me in particular . What am I to do ? Charles Reade has written a recipe that applies very well just here . It is briefly expressed : " Put yourself in his place . " I could not have done this a few years ago , but now I can . Never , until I undertook the management of my business affairs  --  never until I had some knowledge of business cares and anxieties , the weight of notes falling due ; the charge of business honor to keep ; the excited hope of fortunate prospects ; and the depression following hard upon failure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize what home should mean to a man , and how far wide of the mark many women shoot , when they aim to establish a restful retreat for their husbands . I have returned to my domicile , after a fatiguing day up town , with a feeling of exhaustion that lies far deeper than the mere physical structure  --  a spent feeling as if I have given my all , and must be replenished before I can make another move . I once had a housekeeper whose very face I dreaded at such times . She always took advantage of my silence and my limp condition , to relate the day 's disasters . She had no knowledge of what a good dinner meant , and no tact in falling in with my tastes or needs . On the contrary ; if there was a dish I disliked , it was sure to appear on those most weary evenings . In brief , from the very moment I reached home , she did nothing but brush my fur up , instead of down , and I did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this housekeeper . I wonder their husbands do n't slay them . If you would look out in my back yard , I fear you would see the bones of several of these tactless , exasperating housekeepers , bleaching in the wind and rain . I marvel that other back yards are not filled with the bones of stupid , tactless , irritating wives . The fact that no such horror has as yet been unearthed , bears eloquent testimony to the noble self-control and patience of many of the sterner sex . " Oh , that sounds well , " said my neighbor , over the way , " but then you forget we women have our trials too . " " Is it going to diminish those trials to make a raging lion out of your husband ? " " No , but he ought to understand that we are tired , and that our work is hard . " " Certainly , " I said , " by all means ; and by the time he thoroughly understands , you generally have occasion to be still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'll tell you what I 'd do ; follow the advice of a sensible little friend of mine , who has four children all of an age , and has incompetent service to rely on , when she has any at all . " " And what is that , pray ? " " She says that come rain , hail , or fiery vapor , she takes a nap every day . " " I do n't know how she manages it ; I ca n't , and I have one less child than she , and a fairly good maid . " " Her children are trained , as children should be ; the three younger ones take long naps after luncheon , and while they are sleeping , she gives the oldest child some picture book to look at , and simple stories to read , and she herself goes to sleep in the same room with him . The little fellow keeps as still as a mouse . " " I think that is a cruel shame . " " So do I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his liberty , and stayed up to take care of him , and then became so tired out that , by the time her husband came home she would be unable to keep her mouth ( closed for it is only a well rested woman who can maintain a cheerful silence ) , and avoid a family quarrel . " " No , I think it 's better not to quarrel , but I ca n't take a nap , and often I 'm so tired when Fred comes home , that , if he happens to be tired too , it 's just like putting fire to gunpowder . " I knew that , for I had heard the explosions from across the street . You know in our climate , in the summer , people practically live in the street , with every window and door open ; your neighbor has full possession of all remarks above E. And most of Mr. and Mrs. Purblind 's notes on the tired nights , are above E. I have no patience with that woman , anyhow . She has n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always in disorder , and there is no suggestion of harmony in the furniture ( on the contrary every article seems , as the French say , to be swearing at every other article ) ; all her lights are high  --  why , I 've run in there of an evening and found that man wandering around like an uneasy ghost , trying to find some easy spot in which he could sit down , and read his paper comfortably . He did n't know what was the matter  --  the poor wretches do n't , but he was like a cat on an unswept hearth . In contrast to this woman 's stupidity , I have the natural loveliness of the little brown thrush , on my one side , and the hoary-headed wisdom of Mrs. Owl , on my other side . Look at the latter a moment . Not worth looking at , you say ; angular , without beauty of form or feature . Nothing but the humorous curve to her lips , and the twinkle in her eye , to attract one ; nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , and good humor . But I assure you that woman 's worth living with if she is not worth looking at ! Now her spouse is one of those lowering fellows , the kind that seems to be at outs with mankind . Just the material to become sulky in any but the most skillful hands , the sort to degenerate into a positive brute , in such blundering hands as Mrs. Purblind 's over the way . I had a chance to watch this man one evening last summer . Having no domestic affairs of my own , as a matter of course I feel myself entitled to share my neighbors ' . And this particular evening I was lonely . It was a nasty night , the fog blown in from the lake slapped one rudely in the face every time one looked out , and the air was as raw as a new wound  --  it went clear to the bone . Now on such a night as this I have known Mrs. Purblind to serve her lord cold veal and lettuce , simple because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I assure you that sufficient heat was generated before this cold supper was consumed . But to return to Mrs. Owl , on that particular night . I saw her watching at door and window , for her partner was late . I peeped into the parlor , and it was as cosy and inviting as a glowing fire , a shaded lamp , and a comfortable sofa wheeled near the table , could make it . By and by , he came glowering along . What will she say , I asked myself . Will it be : " Oh , how late you are ! What 's the matter ? What kept you ? Well , come in , you must be cold . Lie down on the sofa while I get supper , but do n't put your feet up till I get a paper for them to rest on . " All this would have answered well enough with a decent sort of a man , but this homo required peculiar treatment . It was what she did n't say that was most remarkable . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word for some time , but walked into the house humming a lively air , and busied herself with his supper . She did n't set this in the dining room , but right before that open fire . Without any fuss or commotion she broiled a piece of steak over those glowing coals , while over her big lamp she made a cup of coffee , and in her chafing dish prepared some creamed potatoes . She had bread and butter ready , and some little dessert , and so with a wave of a fairy wand , as it seemed , there was the cosiest , most tempting little supper you ever saw on the table at his side . Meanwhile he had found the sofa , the fire , and the lamp , and was reading his paper . He threw the latter down when supper was announced , and she joined him at the table ; poured his coffee , ate a bit now and then for company , and talked  --  why , how that woman did talk ! I could n't hear a word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face it was humorous ; and laugh , how she laughed ! and erelong he joined in  --  why , once he leaned back , and actually ha-haed . When supper was over , she left him to his paper again , while she cleared everything away . Later on she joined him , and the next I knew they were playing chess , and still later , talking and reading aloud . This is but a sample of her life with him  --  in everything she consults his mood , his comfort , his tastes . She never jars him  --  never rubs him the wrong way , and meanwhile she has all she wants , for she can do anything with him , and he thinks the sun rises and sets with her . It is a good cook that makes an appetizing dish out of poor material , and when a woman makes a delicious husband out of little or nothing she may rank as a chef . II You may say all I have been describing belongs more properly to little Mrs. Thrush , on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think and plan to make things comfortable . Were she set down in the desert of Sahara , she would sweep it up , spread a rug ; hang a few draperies , and lo ! it would be cosy and home-like . She ca n't help being and doing just right , wherever she is put , and her husband is just like her , as good as gold . Why , that man would bore a woman of ingenuity  --  a woman who had a genius for contriving and managing . He does n't need any cooking ; he 's ready to serve just as he is , could n't be improved . There 's absolutely nothing to be done . Mrs. Owl would get a divorce from him inside of a month , on the ground of insipidity . Her fine capabilities for making much out of nothing , would turn saffron for lack of use . Mr. Owl is the mate for her . To every man according to his taste ; to every woman according to her need . I am lying in the hammock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speculating on all these matters . Summer is now upon us , for we are in the midst of June . Yesterday was one of Lowell 's rare days , but this morning the thermometer took offense , and rose in fury . I can see the quivering air as it radiates from the dusty , sun-beaten road , and a certain drowsy hum in the atmosphere , palpable only to the trained ear , tells of the great heat . Some of my neighbors are sitting on their galleries , reading or sewing ; some , like myself , are lolling in hammocks ; even the voices of the children have a certain monotonous tone , in harmony with the stupid heaviness of the day . Only the birds and squirrels show any life or spirit ; the former are twittering above my head , courting , it may be , or possibly discussing some detail of household economy . They hop from bough to bough , touch up their plumage , and chirp in a cheerful , happy sort of fashion , as if this was their especial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a squirrel is racing about , in the exuberance of his glee . He has done up his work , no doubt , and now is off for a frolic . I lie here , not a stone 's throw from him , watching his merry antics , and rejoicing to think how free from fear he is , when all at once the leaves of his tree are cut by a flying missile , and the next second I see my gay fellow tumble headlong from the bough , and fall in a helpless little heap on the grass . I start up in affright , and hear a passing boy call out to another , over the way , " I brought him down , Jim . " Involuntarily I clinch my hands . " You little coward ! " I exclaim , " it is you who should be brought down ! You are too mean to live . " He laughs brutally , and goes on , whistling indifferently , while I pick up the dead squirrel lying at my feet . I find myself crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the squirrel ; something else is hurting me . " Is this the masculine nature ? " I ask some one  --  I do n't know whom . Perhaps it is one of those questions which are flung upward , in a blind kind of way , and which God sometimes catches and answers . " Are they made this way ? Was it meant that they should be brutal ? " I am still holding the squirrel and thinking , when I hear my name , and turning see my neighbor over the way , Mrs. Purblind 's brother , standing near me . " Good morning , Mr. Chance , " I say , rather coldly . All men are hateful to me at that moment ; to my mind they all have that boy 's nature , though they keep it under cover until they know you well , or have you in their power . " The little fellow is dead , I suppose , " he said . " Yes , " I answer with a sob which I turn away to conceal . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would only see something laughable in my grief , and he could n't dream what I am thinking about . " You must n't be too hard on the boy , Miss Leigh , " he says quietly ; " it was a brutal act , but that same aggressiveness will one day give him power to battle in life against difficulties and temptations as well . It will make him able to protect those whom a kind Providence may put in his charge . Just now he does n't know what to do with the force , and evidently has not had good teaching . I 'm sorry he did this ; it hurts me to see an innocent creature harmed , and still more I am sorry because it has hurt you . " He is standing near me now , and as I raise my eyes , I find him looking at me with a sweet earnestness , that wins me not only to forgive him for being a man , but to feel that perhaps men are noble , after all . His look and tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cadence of music may vibrate through the soul when both musician and instrument are mute . The day after this of which I have been telling , I went to a picnic gotten up by Mrs. Purblind , for the entertainment and delectation of Mr. Purblind 's cousin , now visiting her , a frivolous young thing , between whom and myself there was not even the weather in common , for she would label " simply horrid " a lovely gray day , containing all sorts of possibilities for the imagination behind its mists and clouds . I did n't care for this picnic , and did n't see why I was invited as most of the guests were younger than myself . But it was one of those cases where a refusal might be misconstrued , and so I went . We sat around the white tablecloth en masse , for dinner ; and in the course of the passing of viands , Miss Sprig was asked to help herself to olives that happened to be near her . " Yes , do , while you have opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity , " replied Miss Sprig with a simper . Whereat Mr. Chance , sitting next her , suggested that , as a synonym of opportunity , possibly he might stand in its stead . I detest such speeches , they are properly termed soft , for they certainly are mushy  --  lacking in stamina  --  fiber of any sort . But I could have endured it , as I had endured much else of the same sort that day , had it not come from Mr. Chance . It may be foolish of me , but his tone and his words of the day before were still with me . They were so dignified , so sensible , so manly , that I respected and admired him . Up to that time I had not felt that I knew him , but after he spoke in that way , it seemed as if we were acquainted . Now I saw how utterly mistaken I had been , and I was mortified and disgusted . The silly little speech I have quoted was not all , by any means ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponded . Evidently he was one of those instruments which are played upon at will by the passing zephyr . With a self-respecting woman , he was manly ; with a vapid , bold girl , he was silly and familiar . I decided that I liked something more stable , something that could be depended upon . I was placed in a difficult position just then . Had I acted upon my impulse , I should have risen and walked off  --  such conduct is an affront to womanhood , I think ; but I was held in my place by a fear  --  foolish , yet grounded , that my action would be regarded as an expression of jealousy , the jealousy of an old maid , of a woman much younger and prettier than herself . This is but one of the many instances of the injustice of the world . I do n't think that I am addicted to jealousy , but I may not know myself . Possibly I might have felt jealous had I been eclipsed by a beautiful or gifted woman , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on seeing a man with whom I have but a slight acquaintance , devote himself to a girl whom I should regard as not only my mental inferior , but also as beneath me morally and socially as well . The only sensation of which I was cognizant was a disgust toward the man , and mortification over the mistaken estimate of his character , that had led me , the day before , to suppose him on a footing with myself . As soon as possible after dinner I slipped away for a stroll . The place was very lovely , and I felt that if I could creep off with Mother Nature , she would smooth some cross-grained , fretful wrinkles that were gathering in my mind , and were saddening my soul . So when the folly and jesting were at their height I dipped into the thicket near at hand , and dodging here and there , jumping fallen logs , and untangling my way among the vines which embraced the stern old woods like seductive sirens , I at last struck a shaded path , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big old lake . It too had dined , but instead of yielding itself to folly , was taking its siesta . Across its tranquil bosom the zephyrs played , stirring ripples and tiny eddies , as dreams may stir lights and shadows on the sleeping face . I had not walked along the beach , with the waves sighing at my feet , and whispering all sorts of soothing nothings , for a great distance , before I began to experience that uncomfortable reaction which sometimes arises from splitting in two , as it were , standing off at a distance and looking oneself in the face . I realized that I had been something of a prig and considerable of a Pharisee . My late discomfort was not caused by the fact that a young girl had cheapened herself , but by the fact that a man had demeaned himself and in a manner involved me , inasmuch as I had been led the day before by a false estimate of his character to regard him as my social equal . After all it was this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my brother about whom I was chiefly concerned . I am not naturally sentimental or morbid , so I merely decided that internally I had made a goose of myself and not shown any surplus of nobility ; and with a little sigh of satisfaction that I had given the small world about me no sign of my folly , I dismissed the subject and betook myself to an eager enjoyment of the day . The soft June breeze played with my hair and gently and affectionately touched my face ; the lake quivering and rippling with passing emotions stretched away from me toward that other shore which it kept secreted somewhere on its farther side . The very sight of it , with its shimmering greens , turquoise blue , and tawny yellow , cooled and soothed me , and ere I knew it , I had slipped into a pleasant , active speculation on matters of larger interest than the petty subjects which had lined my brow a moment before . I was walking directly toward one of my families , and it occurred to me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was near at hand . I had first become interested in them at church . I was impressed by their cleanliness and regularity of attendance , and by a certain judicious arrangement of their children  --  the parents always sitting so as to separate the latter by their authority and order . Another point that claimed my attention was that the children were changed each Sunday  --  a fresh three succeeding the first bunch , and on the third Sunday , one of the first three being added to a fresh two , to make up the proper complement . Both parents had a self-respecting , self-sacrificing look , as of people who had learned to help themselves cautiously from the family dish , and to " put their knives to their throats " before time ; but kept all this to themselves , asking nothing from anyone , and making their little answer without murmur or complaint . I had , for some time , realized that the child who was now getting more than his share of sermons , by reappearing on the third Sunday , would soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new relative would take the place which he had been filling as a matter of accommodation . I sought occasion to make the acquaintance of the mother of this fine brood , on the pretext of some church work , and after that became a regular visitor at their little home . The perfect equality of the parents ; the deference with which they treated one another ; and their quiet happiness , in spite of all labor and privation , made me realize that they might well extend a pitying thought to some of the apparently wealthy members of the church . We may yet live to see the day when a new scale shall come in vogue , and some Croesus who now stands in an enviable light , shall then pass into his true position , and become an object of pity . Mere dollars and cents are a misleading criterion of poverty and wealth . I had seen my friends , and found that the mother and her new nestling were in comparative comfort , and I was on the homeward stretch along the beach , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was commissioned to look you up , " he said . " Thank you , " I replied , " I have been of age for some years . " Of course he noticed the coolness in my voice , and in some way I divined that he knew the cause . We went aboard our homeward-bound train about 5 o'clock . Mr. Chance helped me on , and evidently expected to sit with me , but I thwarted him by dropping down beside an elderly lady , an acquaintance who happened to be in that coach . I felt no grudge against him , but I did n't care to have him pass from such a girl as Miss Sprig to me ; his conduct with her impaired his value somewhat in my eyes . My elderly friend saw and recognized the situation , I am sure , and governed her later remarks accordingly . Mr. Chance passed on , and took a seat with one of the superfluous men , for contrary to the rule on most such occasions , the male gender was in excess of the female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sprig ; men always become satiated with such girls , soon or late . My elderly acquaintance entered upon an animated conversation , that became more and more personal , and finally reached a climax when she leaned over , and said in a semi-whisper : " My dear Miss Leigh , you ought to marry . " I had been told this a number of times ; any one would suppose , to listen to some of these women , that I had but to put out my hand , and pluck a man from the nearest bush . " I do n't doubt you will marry some day , but I 'm afraid you may not choose wisely "  --  here she lowered her voice again  --  " after a man reaches thirty-five he becomes very fixed in his ways , and I do n't think it 's safe for a maiden lady to try to manage him ; it needs some one of more experience . " I knew she had Mr. Chance in mind , and I was so indignant at being warned against a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as addressing me , that the blood mounted to my hair . Observing this , my elderly companion whispered : " I was n't thinking of any one , in particular , my dear ; " upon which I grew more enraged , and the color in my face deepened until I must have resembled an irate old turkey gobbler  --  " not of any one in particular , my dear ; but on general principles , I should n't advise such a match . A widower would be just the thing for you , and there always are widowers , and every year the list grows  --  death makes inroads , you know . " This idea , this hope of a second crop , as I had passed beyond the first picking , was comforting . I knew perfectly well whom she had in mind for me  --  a nice fat little widower , about fifty years old , who had been held on the marital spit , until he was done to a turn . III The summer was ended , and I was not married . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my mind life did not swing on this hinge . I had my occupations  --  there were a goodly number of needy folk to be looked after ; there was my reading ; my music ; my friends , and other pleasures , and altogether I felt I was very well off . Not that I was cynically opposed to marriage ; I intended to marry , if the right man called , but if he did not I was content to end life as I had begun it  --  in single blessedness . My neighbors , however , were of another mind  --  I must marry ; and they kept making efforts to find some one who would fit , trying on one man after another , without his consent or mine , something as one would attempt to force clothes on a savage . But in spite of all such friendly offices the summer was ended , and I was not married . I was thinking of it on this particular day , as I stood gazing from the window  --  thinking of it with a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this end , it was rather surprising that I was not double by this time . Had they succeeded I should now occupy a very different attitude . It is only old bachelors and old maids who speculate and theorize on marriage ; when people are really about it , they say little , and ( it would often appear ) think less . It was a day for speculation  --  this particular one ; the dead leaves were scurrying up the street as people ran for a train ; a gusty wind was carrying all before it for the time being , like an overbearing debater . The trees shook and groaned , recoiled and shuddered , like human creatures in the blast ; in their agitation dropping hosts of leaves that immediately slipped under covert , or else joined their fellows in the race up town . The sky was non-committal , and the lake looked dark and secretive , as if it meditated wreck and disaster . It was only the middle of September , but there had been several of these days  --  a hint , perchance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a gay waltz strain sometimes dips into real life , and makes one look inward for a moment . The house did not invite me just at this time , and the elements did ; at least I felt that rising within me which tempted me forth to have a bout with them . I was walking at a goodly pace along the Boulevard  --  for I love the lake in all its moods  --  when two men with anxious faces overtook , and hurried past me . " There 's been a wreck , miss , " one of them  --  a man I knew  --  called back . I quickened my pace , trying to peer through the sullen fog , as I ran . The occasional dull boom of a gun called " Help , " from out the grayness , with pathetic persistency . Soon another sound caught my ear , or rather vibrated through my frame , for the ground beneath me seemed to tremble , and I turned to see the swift oncoming of the life-saving crew from a station below us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge wagon , bearing the boat and its men , swept past me , every one of those splendid horses with his head lowered , and his fine muscles set for the race . It was all done with the celerity and ease with which things are accomplished in dreams . The sudden halting of the big wagon ; the swinging of the boat to the ground ; the swift donning of the yellow oilskin suits by the crew ; the launch , and before one had time to wink , the strong strokes in perfect time , that bore the boat up and down , and up again , on those tumultuous waves . There were other spectators beside myself , standing with strained sight and hearing , and throbbing hearts , upon the strip of beach . And there were other workers beside the crew . I had thought we were a small community out there in the little suburb , and I gazed with wonder that morning at the crowd which seemed to have dropped from the sky , or come up from below . The men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others go in on early trains , but Randolph Chance was there , his newspaper work giving him his mornings . We spoke to one another , but entered into no conversation . My thought was with the doomed ship , and so was his . " Will any of you boys join me in taking off some of those people ? " he asked the men at hand . " It 's a rough sea , Mr. Chance . " " I know it , but I understand boating ; I guess we can manage it . " " Do n't you think the life-saving crew can do the work ? " I asked . " No , " he answered shortly , " there wo n't be time for them to make enough trips . Come , boys , here she goes ! Jump in , a half dozen of you that can pull oars . " There were boats enough , and soon there were men enough , for the human heart is kind and brave , and under a good leader men will walk up to Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alert , and self controlled  --  a good leader . I realized all this just now , as I had not before , and I thought how strange it was that so much goodness should be bound up with so much folly . It was the old story of the wheat and the tares ; and I said : " An enemy hath done this , " and then I thought of Miss Sprig . I do n't like to dwell on that morning ; the experience was new to me , and I ca n't forget it ; I ca n't rid myself of the sound of those shrieks when the ship went down . She struggled like a human creature under a sudden blow  --  rocked , tottered , quivered , and then collapsed . The little boats made five trips and brought ashore almost all the passengers and crew  --  all but one woman , and a little child . I was one of the many who received the chilled and frightened victims of the storm , and indeed , as soon as we were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned our thought to the brave crews of the little boats , for their exertions had been almost superhuman , and they were well-nigh exhausted . I bent over Randolph Chance , and begged him to take a little brandy some one had brought . " Give it to the women , " he said feebly . " They are all cared for ; I 'm going to look out for you now , Mr. Chance . " " I would n't feel so done up , " he said , " if it were n't for that woman . She begged me to save her , and she had a little child in her arms , " and his voice broke . " You must n't think of her , " I said , " you did all you could . " " Yes , I did my best to reach her , but before I could get there , she went down . I can never forget her face . Oh , at such a time a fellow ca n't help wishing he were just a little quicker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beach where he had flung himself or fallen , on leaving the boat , but he fell again . I could plainly see that the exhaustion from which he suffered was due as much to mental distress as to physical effort , and I thought no less of him for that . He was finally prevailed upon to get into the wagon which had brought the life-saving crew , and which was now loaded down with the other boatmen , and many of the passengers from the wreck , and so he was taken home . And I walked back alone , with a queer little feeling somewhere in the region of my heart . Man , after all , is a harp , I said to myself ; a good player  --  the right woman can draw forth wonderful music , but the wrong woman will call out nothing but discords . Materials do n't count for everything ; there 's a deal in the cooking . I was on my way home , when I met two of my neighbors hurrying toward the scene  --  Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " it 's all over . " " I only heard of it a little while ago ; " said Mrs. Daemon ; " I was in the city , and I met Mr. Daemon who had just been told there was a wreck off this shore , and was coming out to see it , so we both took the first train . " They hurried on , wishing to see what they could , and I walked homeward . Their appearance had slipped into my reflections as neatly as a good illustration slips into a discourse . I must tell you their story , and then see if you dare say man is not a harp , and woman not a harpist . Years ago , when I was a child , I used to see my mother wax indignant over the wrongs inflicted upon one of her neighbors  --  a gentle little woman whose backbone evidently needed restarching . She was the mother of three children , and should have been a most happy wife , for her tastes were domestic  --  her devotion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of overbearing , tyrannical temper  --  one of those ugly natures in which meanness is generated by devotion . The more he realized his power over his poor little wife , the more he bullied her , and beneath this treatment she faded , day by day , until finally she closed her tired , pathetic eyes forever . My mother used to say she had no doubt the man was overwhelmed by her death , and would have suffered from remorse , but for the injudicious zeal of some of the neighbors , who were so wrought up by this culmination of years of injustice and cruelty , that they attacked him fore and aft , as it were , creating a scandalous scene over the little woman 's remains , accusing him of being her murderer , and assigning him to the warmest quarters in the nether world . As a result of this outbreak of public opinion the man hardened , and assumed a defiant attitude which he continued to maintain toward the neighbors for some years . In the midst of all this furor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The power of the silent woman has often been dwelt upon , but I really do not think that half enough has been said , although I am aware of committing an absurdity when I recommend voluble speech on the subject of silence . Jesting and paradoxes aside , however , the silent woman wields a power known only to the man toward whom her silence is directed . In this particular case the power was all for the best . Erelong the sister-in-law obtained such mastery over the forlorn household that she held not only the fate of the little ones , but that of the father as well , in the hollow of her hand . Two years slipped by , and then the neighborhood that had dozed off , as it were , awoke to hear that the sister was going to marry that awful man . At once the vigilance committee arose , and took the case in hand . " It ca n't be possible , " it cried to the woman . " Yes , it is true , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister ? " " I know he did . " " And you are going to marry him , in face of that ? " " Yes . " " Well , he 'll kill you . " " Oh , no , he wo n't kill me "  --  there was a peculiar light in her eyes that puzzled them . " What can you want to marry such a man for ? " they cried , coming back to the original question . " To keep the children . If I do n't marry him , some one else will , and those children will go out of my hands . " Her devotion to the motherless brood had been past praise . There was nothing more to be said , and if there had been it would have availed nothing , for the sister had a mind of her own . She was one of those handsome women , who walk this earth like queens , and to whom lesser folk defer . She married , and lo ! the neighborhood was agog once more , for strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared for a time that instead of his killing her she was like to kill him . I remember one tale in particular , which my mother who , by the way , was no gossip , and was as peaceable as a barnyard fowl , was in the habit of rehearsing before a chosen few , occasionally , with a quiet relish that was amusing , considering the fact that ordinarily any comment on her neighbors ' affairs was alien to her . It appeared that after a short wedding trip , during which the bridegroom had several times shown the cloven foot , the couple returned to their domicile . Probably the maids who had lived there for some years and were devoted to the new wife , had been warned of what was coming . At all events , they accepted everything as a matter of course . Upon the evening of the married pair 's return , a handsome dinner was served . The train was a trifle behind time ; the day had been cold , and several other untoward circumstances had conspired to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served to touch off this inflammable material . "  --   --  these servants ! " he exclaimed ; " I 'll kick every one of them through the front window ! Look at that roast ! " The doors being now open , a perfect storm of ugly , evil tempers poured forth . At such times as these it was the custom of wife number one to shiver , shrink , implore  --  weep , then take the offending roast from the room , and replace it by something else which most likely was hurled at her , in the end . The present Mrs. Daemon neither shivered nor shrank . She knew what to expect when she married this man , and she was ready . The guns were loaded and aimed , and they went off , and presto ! the enemy lay dead on the dining room floor . Instead of a roast beef solo , there was a duet , Mrs. Daemon 's feminine soprano rising above her husband 's masculine roar . She agreed with what he said as to the disposition of the servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before he put them through the front window . " To insult us during our honeymoon with such a roast , " she cried ; " and look at this gravy ! It 's even worse ! " And with one swift stroke of her hand she sent the gravy bowl flying from off the table on to the handsome carpet . " In Heaven 's name , what are you about ? " he bawled . " Do you suppose I 'd offer you such gravy ; it ought to be flung in their faces . " He gasped and stammered ; thought of the recent wedding and regretted it ; but he was married now , and to an awful shrew ! Soon after dinner they repaired to the drawing room . In turning from the fireplace he stumbled against a large , elegant vase . " Confound that thing ! " he exclaimed , " I always did hate those vases that set on the floor . " " So do I ! " she chimed in , and putting out her foot with an expressive jerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred fragments . " Do you see what you 've done ? " he cried , " have you forgotten that that vase was a present from me ? " " No , I have n't , but we both hate it , and what 's the use of keeping it ? " This was but the beginning ; from that time on , let him but murmur against a dish , and it was flung on to the floor ; torrents of abuse were poured upon the head of a maid with whom he found fault ; some of the handsomest furniture in the house was broken , the moment it gave offense to him . In no vehemence was he alone  --  his wife 's anathemas and abuse joined and exceeded his , until  --  he had enough of it  --  an overdose , in fact , and erelong he turned a corner  --  came out of Hurricane Gulch into Peaceful Lane , and he hoped the latter would know no turning . The servants whispered of times when he would tell his wife of guests invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene while they were there . Sixteen years have gone by , and this woman is still above ground ; stranger still the man is alive as well ; and strangest of all , they are still under the same roof . Indeed , if report and appearance are to be trusted , Mr. Daemon is a model husband , and Mrs. Daemon 's sudden and amazing temper has spent itself and left her a person of spirit indeed , but in nowise unamiable , and least of all , an ugly character . No one who saw them walk past me , arm in arm , that morning , on their way to the wreck , would have dreamed of their past . Truly , man is a harp , and truly , woman does the harping . IV I have been wandering about to-day in an apparently aimless fashion , but in reality " musing upon many things . " Our horror of shiftlessness , and our realization of the responsibilities of life , and of the important work Providence has kept saving up for us , or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's future mate , is expressed in the fact that if we take an hour 's leisure , anywhere betwixt sunrise and sunset , we feel under bonds to explain the matter not only to our own souls , but also to those other souls who live adjacent , and take an everlasting interest in ours . Consequently , I told myself this day that I was not well  --  that I had been overdoing , and that I had best " go easy for a spell . " After which concession to my interior governor , I proceeded to apologize to my neighbors ; to call my dogs  --  not to apologize to them , but to solicit their company  --  and then to hie me away to the lake , remembering to walk feebly as long as I was in sight . I did n't go down to the beach , but plunged into the cool , comforting heart of a ravine ; fathomed its depths , with a feeling of delightful seclusion , and came out on the thither side , to find myself in the glowing October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ! Good , rich streams of blood coursed through my veins , and painted a warm tint in my cheeks . At that moment I hope I looked a trifle like Nature , who was in the height of her being ; in a sort of tropical luxuriance , like a beautiful woman at the very summit of maturity and perfection . I put out my hands toward a clump of sumach  --  I was not cold , but its brilliant warmth lured me as does a glowing fire . It permeated my very being , and set my soul a-throbbing . There had been rain , and then warmth , and October had caught all the prismatic colors of the drops of water , and was giving them forth with Southern prodigality . The birds bent over the swaying daisies , and sang soft love-notes into their great , dark eyes , while I looked on in an ecstasy of wonder and delight  --  the gold of the daisies , the gold of the sunlight , and the glow in my heart , seeming in a way all one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Father . It is a glorious world , and it is glorious to live therein . The very air about me  --  the air I was breathing in , seemed to palpitate color and brilliant beauty . I talked to Duke about it , and he looked around him with a certain air of admiration depicted on his noble , fond old face . Fanchon was frivolous , as usual , and wanted to be running giddily about , hunting rabbits and the like ; but I made her sit beside me , for it seemed a desecration every time the October silence of those woods was broken by aught save the dropping of a ripened nut , or the whirr of a homing bird . It was at the close of this mellow day that I sat in my library alone , before a hickory fire . Alone , did I say ? Nay , Mrs. Simpson sat before me in the opposite rocker . You could not have seen her , or heard her , but she was there , and was complaining of Mr. Simpson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as she talked I recalled a certain evening when I had been her guest  --  included in an invitation to attend a spectacular entertainment given by the country club , at a spot some distance from our homes , and I said : " Mrs. Simpson , I can offer you some recipes which I warrant you will work infallibly ; but they are like the recipe for determining the interior condition of eggs , which says , put them in water ; if they are bad they will either sink or swim  --  I have forgotten which . Now try this recipe I am about to give you , and it will either make Mr. Simpson unwilling to take a step in the way of recreation without you , or it will make him stalk forth by himself , as lonely as a crocus in early March  --  I have forgotten which ; but try it often enough , and you will learn . " Recipe . " Fail to be ready at the appointed time , and keep him waiting until he is either raging or sullen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on edge . Then complain of the gait taken by Mr. Simpson in order to catch the train ; declare frequently when aboard that you are tired out , and are sorry you came . After you reach the place , remark every now and then that you do n't think the entertainment amounts to much , and that you do think it was a piece of extravagance to have given such a price for tickets to so-inferior an exhibition . Next , declare that you feel a draft , and are catching your ' death of cold ; ' interlard all this with frequent directions to the children  --  admonitions and complaints , and derogatory remarks about Mr. Simpson 's appearance , and wonder  --  oft-expressed and reiterated , and put in the form of questions which you insist upon his answering , as to why he did n't wear his other suit of clothes . Finally , wind up the whole affair , by wishing you were in bed , and announcing your opinion that the trip did n't pay , and you are sure it will make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it wo n't fail to accomplish something decided . " One more recipe . I was talking to Mrs. Purblind now ; Mrs. Simpson had had her fill , and gone home ; and Mrs. Purblind had taken her place . You could n't have seen her  --  but that does n't matter . Recipe . " This is for making a man love to stay at home with you , and inducing him to be cheerful and companionable , or for making him flee your presence as one would flee a plague-stricken city : I 've forgotten which , but you will soon discover , if you try it persistently . " Talk on disagreeable themes , talk persistently and ceaselessly ; never let up ; the more tired he may be the more steadily you must talk , and the more irritating your theme must be . Go to the gadfly ; consider her ways and be wise . Buzz , buzz , buzz ; sting , sting , sting . " On his worst nights , always select his relatives for your theme ; harp upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unpleasant things people say of them . Then if he waxes irritable , express surprise ; remind him how he used to talk against these same relatives , and how much trouble he gave them when he lived at home ; add that it 's plain now that he has combined with his relatives against you , and that you should be surprised if he and they did n't effect a separation . If he is still in earshot , pass on to what he once told you , beginning each remark with : " You said that  --   --  " And then proceed to point out wherein and howin he has utterly failed to make good his promises . Further , if he is still in the house , enlarge upon the change you have noted in his conduct toward you  --  how devoted he used to be , and how selfish he has become . Next , tell him how well-dressed other women are , and how little you have on . " By this time , if not sooner , he will remember that he has night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presence at the club is absolutely necessary , and it would be well for you to conclude your remarks by observing that if he bangs the front door so hard every time he goes out , he will loosen the hinges . " " Well now , " said Mrs. Purblind  --  the invisible Mrs. Purblind ( she always would listen to reason , which is more than could be said for the visible creature of that name ) , " well now , I know well enough when I go on that way , that it is n't best to do it ; but the Evil One seems to enter me , and I get going , and I could n't stop unless I bit my tongue off . " " Bite it then , " I said , " and after that , jump into the lake ; were you once there , your virtues would float , and your husband would love them ; but alive , your virtues are beneath water , and your nagging is always on top . " " But what is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposing you suffer from all these wrongs . " " Did you ever right a wrong by setting it before your husband in this way , and at these times ? " " No . " " Did you ever improve your condition ? " " No . But what would you do ? " " Shut up . Dip deep into silence . In the first place , when you find you have poor material , take extra care in the cooking ; study the art ; use all the skill you can acquire , and finally , if that wo n't do , if it positively wo n't  --  if you ca n't make a decent dish out of him , open the kitchen door , and heave him into the ash-barrel , and the ash-man will cart him away . " I have traveled a little in my life , and have been entertained in various households . I have seen wives who deserve crowns of laurel , to compensate for the crown of thorns they have worn for years ; but I have seen others , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the sharp end . Some of these stupid , ignorant women fancied they were doing everything possible to make home pleasant , and wondered at their failure . There they sat , prodding their husbands with hat-pins , and grieved over the poor wretches ' irritability . I recall a conversation I once overheard . The husband arrived just at dinner time . The wife heard him come in , and called to him in a faint , dying voice , from the top of the stairway  --  " George , is that you ? " The answer was spiritless . " Yes . " The wife came downstairs . " Well , then , we can have dinner . I do n't know that it 's ready , though ; Bridget has had a toothache all day , and she 's just good-for-nothing . " All this in the same faded tone of voice . The husband passed into the parlor , and began to read the paper . The weary tongue of his feminine partner wagged on , in a dreary sort of way . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of pluck . I 've been trying to persuade her to go to the dentist 's and have her teeth out , but she wo n't . I 'm just tired to death to-night , and there 's no end to the work ; Bridget has been moaning around all day  --  why her teeth  --   --  " " Oh , bother her teeth ! " " Why , do n't you care to hear anything that goes on at home , George ? " " I do n't care to hear about teeth that go on at home ; Bridget 's teeth especially . I do n't care a rap for the whole set . " " How cross you are to-night , George ! when I 'm so tired , too . Johnnie , your face is dirty , go and wash it ; be quick now , for it 's time for dinner . I do n't know that Bridget will ever call us . She 's probably sitting out in the kitchen , nursing her teeth ; why she has five roots there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bother her roots , I say ! " " George , you are extremely irascible , but that 's the way ; I get no sympathy at all . " " Not when you want it by the wholesale for Bridget 's roots . " " Well , what should we talk about ? I do n't see how we can ever have conversation in the home , if you wo n't listen to anything . " And so they went on  --  the tired husband , moody and irritable , and the tired wife , loquacious about matters of no interest . I felt sorry for her who spake , and him who heard . A husband worn out with the cares and worries of an unsatisfactory business day , and a wife harrassed and fretted by overwork and petty annoyances , could succeed in talking pleasantly together only by the use of will-power and principle . It would require a big effort , but the effort would pay . It would be one of the best investments a married pair could make . The returns would be quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . V I had not forgotten Mr. Chance . This fact annoyed me excessively , since I saw that he had forgotten me . A forgotten man may remember a woman , and preserve his self-respect , if not his merriment ; but when a forgotten woman remembers a man , that is quite another thing . Not that I was brooding over Mr. Chance  --  far from it ; I thought very little of him , in one way , for I frequently saw him with Miss Sprig ; but in spite of all that , I could not quite forget the impression he made upon me the day those boys killed the gay little squirrel , and again the day the poor mother went down into the deep , dark water with her child held close to her agonized heart . The feeling I experienced for him on that awful day , was unique in my history . I had never been an impressionable girl as far as men were concerned  --  I was not an impressionable woman . For me to carry the thought of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and above all to take pleasure in dwelling upon it , meant more than it would have meant for some women . That was as far as the matter had gone , but it was far enough  --  too far , considering his evident indifference , and I was humiliated , for the first time in my life , over my attitude toward a man . This mortification induced me to treat Mr. Chance even more coldly than I should have done ordinarily , though his trifling with Miss Sprig would have called forth some coolness of conduct under any circumstances . I had abundant opportunity to express myself in this way , for Mr. Chance 's night work necessitated late rising , and I saw him to speak to him almost every morning . Indeed , I took some pains to be in my garden during the forenoon , and from this vantage ground I could not only see much that took place between himself and Miss Sprig , but I also had opportunity to speak with him as he passed my house , on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . He evidently absorbed much of her time and thought , and she evidently regarded him as her latest victim , for she made him a common subject of talk , and her entire acquaintance had the pleasure of hearing the foolish things he did and said . She always represented him as deeply in love with her ; I have no doubt she really thought that he was . For my own part , I cared very little whether he was in love , as it is called , or not . If he had succumbed to such a shallow-pated , bold , common girl , I felt contempt for him , and this contempt was deepened when I realized that he might be trifling with her . In any event it mortified and angered me to think he had been seen with me ; ( he had often called upon me and we had been out together several times ) , and that the old neighborhood gossips had coupled our names . Now it would be reported that Miss Sprig had cut me out ; if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old heads , and whisper about my efforts to win him back ; if I was cool , they would shake these same empty pates , and prattle about my wounded affections . It was one of those cases where you ca n't possibly do the right thing  --  I mean the thing that will silence the clacking tongue : consequently , as luck would have it , I plunged into the worst possible course I could have taken , for when Mrs. Catlin , who lived catacorner from me , and who watched me as a cat watches a mouse , said something one day about Mr. Chance 's feeling bound to pay attention to Mr. Purblind 's cousin , as long as she was visiting there , and that she knew such a girl was n't to his taste , and she was sure he would come to his senses soon , I was so angry that I lost control of my temper , and all control of my wits , and blazed out with : " It 's none of my business or concern whom he pays attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well mated . " Whereupon , realizing I had made a perfect fool of myself , and that this speech of mine would go the rounds of the suburb , and I could never erase it from the village mind  --  not if I lived a hundred sensible years , I had much ado to withhold myself from seizing a pot of bachelors ' buttons that stood near , and breaking the whole thing over Mrs. Catlin 's idiotic skull . It was on top of this pleasant interview with Mrs. Catlin , that Mr. Chance came over , and asked me to attend a concert that evening with himself and Miss Sprig , and he very narrowly avoided receiving the bachelors ' buttons that Mrs. Catlin had but just escaped . I strode indoors , and began packing some of my effects , for I was resolved to move that day , or the next . Not because I had discovered I had such fools for neighbors  --  I had always known that  --  but because I had just discovered that they had a fool for a neighbor . Worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penates that I had slammed into a trunk , mended their broken noses , and set them in place once more ; but I hid myself away for several days , much as Moses was hidden , but for a less dignified reason . After a time , I cooled off , and decided to accept the world as it stood , and not to rage because the millennium did not come before I was fitted to enjoy it . Mrs. Purblind ran over one afternoon , and I could see that she was far from happy . I had noticed for some weeks various changes in the direction of improvement , in her care of her husband and household . I had also noticed that Mr. Purblind 's conduct did not keep pace with these improvements , but I fancied Mrs. Purblind was not sharp enough to see or sensitive enough to care . In this it seems I erred , as I have in one , or perhaps two , other directions during my life . As Mrs. Purblind , for the first time since I have known her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up a book at random , and began reading aloud . As luck would have it , I stumbled into some passages descriptive of the ideal home , and before I could stumble out again , the poor woman burst into tears . I suppose that tender little sentence served as the key that unlocked the floodgates . As soon as her grief had spent itself , she apologized , and ascribed her tears to bad news in a letter or something , and shortly afterward left . I watched her walking down the street , until my eyes were too dim to see her . It grieved me sorely that the cause of her sorrow was so deep , and so delicate that I could not offer her my sympathy . Her tears were piteous to me , and I wanted to take her to my heart , and tell her how sorry I was for her ; but to do that would have been to take advantage of her moment of weakness , and that I could not  --  must not do . So I let her go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had received disturbing news , while all the time my heart was aching in unison with hers , and I kept her with me in thought , all day . I went down to the lake directly after dinner ; several things were troubling me , and I wanted to lay my puzzled head on Mother Nature 's bosom . My run down the steep sides of the bluff set the blood to coursing smartly through my veins , and a new and more cheerful stream of thought to flowing . I was tired that night , and it was a luxury to lie flat upon my back on the beach , listening to the rhythmical thud of the big , long wave at my feet , and the song of the stars overhead . There is something unspeakably tranquillizing in the studded dome of heaven ; there is also something unspeakably sad . It bends over the struggling , yearning , aching human heart , as a mother , who has attained that peace which is the outgrowth of suffering , bends over the passion , the sobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hush , it is all for the best . " " I can not  --  will not bear it ! " " Hush , you know not what you say . God 's hand is in it all . " " There is no God in this , or if there is , He hates me ! " " Ah , my child , He loves you with unutterable love , and pities with unutterable pity . Yet a little while , and the day shall shine upon you ; then you will know  --  a little while . " I turned from the great vault above me , and looked out upon the restive waters , and as I turned I saw a shadowy Mrs. Purblind sitting beside me on the beach , and questioning with sad eyes and heart , the stars that bent to listen . " I have tried , " she said ; her face , usually so thoughtless , tear-stained , and quivering . " Yes , I know you have tried , " I answered ; " I have seen that ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , and will be for a long time , and you will have to go on trying for years , if you want to carry him back to the old days , " I said . " That 's one of the hardest things in all the world ! " she cried passionately , " if we stop doing right  --  the right stops with us , but if we stop doing wrong and begin to do right , the wrong goes on . " " Not for always , " I said , looking up to the stars . " Oh , for so long ! " The great dome rich with gems , and deep with peace , bent over her , and by and by her sobs ceased . " You are trying , I know , " I reiterated , " but you do n't understand  --  you ca n't , for you have only a woman 's nature . " " What should I have , pray ? " " A woman 's , and a man 's , and a child 's , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must be able to comprehend them all . Your husband came home cross to-night . " " Yes , irritable toward us all , and I so hoped to have everything pleasant this evening . " " He , too , had his hopes to-day , and they were flung to the ground , and broken before his eyes . " " What do you mean ? " " The special agent of a company that he has for a year been working to get , has been in town . " " Yes , I know . " " Yesterday this agent led him to suppose he was to be the favored one . All to-day he has been working toward that end , and near night he heard that this man had gone , without even saying good-by . You remember that Mr. Purblind left home in a hurry this morning , with scarcely a bite of breakfast ; he took very little luncheon , and  --   --  " " Well , we had dinner at the usual time , if he 'd said he was hungry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hungry  --  he was much more than that . Did you ever see a vessel whose fuel is well-nigh exhausted drag herself into port ? What is the first thing to be done ? " " I do n't know  --  replenish her ? " " Yes , put coal on board . Now when I saw your husband walk up to his front door , I said to myself , he needs coaling . A good home should be a good coaling station ; remember that . " " But what of me ? " she asked with some impatience , " I , too , have my worries and exertions  --  do I never need coaling ? " " Frequently , " I answered . " Well , who is to coal me , I should like to know ? " " Yourself . " " That 's rather one-sided , I think . Why should n't my husband look to that ? " " My dear , " I said earnestly , " I never knew but one man who saw when his wife needed coaling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gods loved him ) , it was found that his shoulder-blades were abnormally large  --  at least so the doctors said , but I knew all the time that his wings had budded . " " Well , this life is too much for me , " murmured Mrs. Purblind drearily . " Then do n't attempt the next . " " I sha n't , if I can help it , and yet I 'm like to soon , for Mr. Purblind 's mother is coming on a visit to us , and I know she 'll worry the breath out of me . " " Do n't let her . " " How can I help it ? " " By keeping the peace with her . " " Oh , I 've tried that before ; I 've done everything I could for her , and deferred to her , and ignored myself until I seemed to fade out of existence , but it did n't work . " " Oh , yes , it did , for it made her ten times as troublesome as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean ? " " I mean that a mother-in-law is like a child , in that she is spoiled by having her own way . " " But what can I do ? " " Walk calmly on , doing the best you can , but recognizing your own authority and dignity , and finally she will come to recognize it . Be mistress of your own household , and director of your own children  --  all this quietly and pleasantly , but without wavering , and in the end she will respect and probably admire you , though she will never think you do just right , or are just the woman who ought to have married her son . " " But I 've always been in hopes of making her love me as she loves her own daughter . " " That is what every romantic woman starts out with , but by and by , in the storm and stress of domestic life , that ideal is cast overboard , as a struggling ship throws its extra cargo over the rail . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his father-in-law . Men are said to be naturally pugnacious . " " That 's a mistake , my dear ; a man would go several miles any day to avoid a fuss ; it is we women who delight in scraps . A man occasionally has a little set-to with the girl 's father , before he gains his consent to the engagement , but once he 's married , it 's the old lady he has to train for , or I should say who trains for him , because as a general thing it is she who gives battle , not he . The real conflict , however , takes place between the two women  --  the wife and her mother-in-law . If you want to see ' de fur fly , ' as the darkies say , you must always come over to the feminine side of the house . Then you 'll have your fill of explanations , expostulations , and recriminations . " " Well , certainly I never had any trouble with my father-in-law . " " Trouble ! Do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No  --  murder him ? " " Murder him , indeed ! Woman , have you no mercantile instinct ? That would be like killing the goose that lays the golden egg . Why , the first showman would take the old gentleman off my hands , and pay me a handsome price for him . You must know that a troublesome father-in-law is so rare that the public would flock to see him . But you could n't get anything for a troublesome mother-in-law . There are too many families trying to get rid of them , at any price . The sale of parents-in-law is governed by the same laws as other commodities , and these interfering , mischief-making mothers-in-law have become a drug in the market . " " Well , there is Mrs. Earnest , her mother-in-law is a jewel . " " Ah , now you mention a most valuable piece of property , for a woman like that  --  who models her conduct on the pattern of Aunt Betsey Trotwood , in David Copperfield 's household , is a jewel of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen sparkling in Abraham 's bosom , from a distance of millions of miles . " " Well , how would you cook mothers-in-law ? " " Make a delicious dish of your husband and then take a pinch  --  a good pinch  --  of mother-in-law , and throw her in as ' sass . ' Speaking of this , remember that too many cooks spoil the broth , and wife and mother-in-law combined generally make a pretty mess of the husband . " VI I was feeling a trifle dull and heavy one afternoon , and after several vain efforts to do good work , decided that a vigorous tramp would set my blood to flowing , and the wheels of my thinking mill to revolving . So out I started toward the lake , as usual . There had been a storm off the Michigan shore , and we were just beginning to get evidence of it , in the big waves that were tumbling on the beach , I like the lake in this mood  --  in any mood , indeed , but especially when it is rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or near the beach , I turned back ; but before going home again , I wished to come in closer contact with the tumultuous waters . At risk of being wet by the spray , which the waves were tossing on high , much as an excited horse tosses the foam from his chafing mouth , I climbed around the little bathing house , set on the shore end of the pier , and then boldly walked out , and took my seat in the midst of the tumult . The passion of the lake was magnificent ; far out  --  as far as eye could stretch  --  there were oncoming waves ; the clan was gathering , and all in battle array . What an overwhelming charge they made ! Surely no one could resist that onslaught . There was no deliberation , as was usual with a moderately heavy sea ; no calm , inevitable heaving of the water ; no steady rising , ever higher and higher , until it crested , curved , and fell with a boom . There was nothing of this to-day ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed and mounted , were already making the attack . For a time I gloried in it all ; even the anger of the waves was more admirable than terrific in my sight . It seemed as though they interpreted my boldness as defiance , and accepted the challenge . From near , from far , they were coming , and all upon me , or if that is taking too much to myself , they were making their attack upon the shore , meaning to claim it for their own , and incidentally to sweep me , a poor , insignificant atom , from their sight . By and by I found myself oppressed with the desolation of the scene . As the day waned , and the chill that foreshadows night fell upon me , or rather rose upon me , from the cold waters , I began to feel lonely and unprotected . The waves looked so hungry , so cruel ; they reached out and up toward me ; they encircled with the inevitable , as with a relentless fate . I began to be afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike the ocean , the lake is fixed ; but that day the increase of the waves , in height and fury , had the effect of a rising tide . I realized that it would be very difficult for me to get off the pier alone , and I was more than relieved to see Randolph Chance , who had come down for a look at the lake before taking his train to the city . He joined me without trouble ; a man can perform those feats so easily , whereas a woman is physically hampered . " You 're in rather a bleak place , Miss Leigh , " he said . " Yes , I have just begun to realize that . " " Oh , well , we 'll manage to get off safely ; but you must n't mind a little wetting . Just give yourself to me , and we 'll be on shore in a minute . " I gladly did as he bade me ; it was luxury just then to have some one as strong and capable as he take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then lifted me from the pier . As he set me safely on the shore , his eyes met mine , and his look was a revelation to me . I was , for a moment , too startled to think , and the strangest sensation I ever experienced crept over me . If a look could speak , Randolph Chance  --  but I did not put it into words  --  not then , at least , but it was all very strange to me  --  most inexplicable . We walked on quietly , both , I dare say , feeling our silence to be a trifle awkward . It was for this reason that I decided to shorten the time of our being together , by stopping at the house of a friend . The wetting I had received from the waves did not amount to anything for one so hardy as myself , so I was not deterred on that account . The house where I stopped was a pleasant resort for me . Both Mr. and Mrs. Bachelor were interesting people . I had known Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our young men , as the saying is , young merely in the sense of being single , not in actual years , for at the time I met him he was nearer the forty than the thirty line . Nature seemed to have marked him for single  --  cussedness , I had almost said , from the first . He was no favorite with any set , being grumpy , fussy , and peculiar . But five years after he rose into sight above my horizon he married a most sensible , lovely woman ; not a child , by the way , for she was almost forty ; and in less than no time , it seemed to us , had a family of four children about him , one following the other so closely that the predecessor was all but overtaken . At first we said among ourselves that he must have borrowed these infants , and stuck them up in his home for appearance 's sake , in some such manner as the proprietor of a summer hotel once stuck a number of trees in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile and enticing . But by and by we became convinced that these little human shoots were his very own , not alone because they evinced some disagreeable crotchets similar to his , but also because of the love he bore them , and the change they wrought in his character and life . Even around court the man was regarded differently ; warmth and esteem being extended him now in place of the dislike he had formerly aroused . He had never ceased to be a study to me , and a certain flavor of romance hung about his home  --  a delightful flavor , that made it an attractive visiting spot . So it was with considerable pleasure that I called upon this particular day . I was shown into the parlor  --  a comfortable room , back of which was a most home-like apartment , called the study . As I sat there , awaiting Mrs. Bachelor 's coming , I noticed that her husband 's desk , which stood in the center of the study , was strewn with dolls , and paraphernalia closely related thereto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who welcomed me in her cordial , cheery way . A minute later Mr. Bachelor came in , and gave me what was for him , a most friendly greeting . He excused himself in a little while , and went into his study . He had , so his wife explained , been ill with a cold for a day or two , and had been working at home the while , to make ready for the approaching trial of an important case . Upon his entering the study , a scene occurred which I shall endeavor to give you as near to the life as possible . As a matter of course he steered directly for his desk , and his eye immediately fell upon a quantity of grandchildren , variously disposed thereon . " Well , I declare ! " he exclaimed ; " if this is n't outrageous ! " and he gathered up the whole crop  --  there were fully a dozen dolls , in all stages of development , and much doll furniture , and toggery of all kinds . After dumping the obnoxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , and with much grumbling sorted out his law-papers , and went to work . But soon after he had cleared his visage , as it were , his small daughter  --  a pretty child , four years old  --  ran into the room hugging two puggy puppies , and two kittens of tender age . It did not take her long to grasp the situation . Running to the divan , she uttered a series of cries , indicative both of alarm and displeasure . " What  --  what  --  what is the matter ? " said Mr. Bachelor , who had probably forgotten his offense by this time . " You naughty papa ! " cried the child ; " what did you disturve my dollies for ? " " What did you put them on my desk for ? " queried her father indignantly ; " the idea ! I have n't a spot on earth I can call my own . " " You 've just mussed their best frocks all up , " continued the child , who , without paying the slightest attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , puppies , kittens , and all , on the desk . " I tell you I ca n't have them here ! I have important papers around , and I must be allowed to work in peace . Take them off ! " He started to sweep them on to the floor , but the little girl uttered a shriek . " Papa , papa , do n't , " she screamed . Then , as he desisted , she added , " They 've just dot to be here  --  it 's the bestest , highest table , and the little doggies and kitties ca n't jump off , and I 'm doing to have a tea-party with Mamie Williams . You must put your nasty old papers somewhere else . " " This is an outrage ! " he exclaimed , standing up and declaiming as if he were in court ; " this is imposition run riot ; it has reached a climax , and I 'll endure it no longer . Evidently I have no rights that even the smallest and youngest in the household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am ruled with a rod of iron , and that even this baby of the family flouts me . I say I will stand it no longer . I have been held with a tight rein , and a curb bit , but I will turn at last . " In his excitement , his metaphors became confused , horses and worms being all mixed up in a heap . " Take the desk , take the whole of it , and to-morrow I shall leave the house ! I shall go back to my bachelor quarters , where I once lived in peace . " The child regarded him seriously , from out her great , brown eyes . " Do n't go away , papa , " she said at last , " you may have a little of your desk , if you wo n't take too much . I did n't mean to be cross at you , " she added , with a pathetic quiver of her lip . " Well , well ! " exclaimed the father hastily , " there , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly little head , " I guess we 'll get on somehow ; if I can have a part of the desk , that 'll answer . It 's big enough for two , I guess . " And he began moving his papers around . " Not there , papa , " said the little tyrant ; " no , that 's the sunny side , and little bowwow must be there , ' cause he 's dot the badest cold , and the kitties have n't dot but little weeny eyes yet , and they must be where it 's most lightest . " " Well , well , well , where may I sit ? I must get to work . " " You may sit right there , and you must n't fiddet , ' cause you 'll upset dolly 's crib , if you do . " Soon he was safely bestowed , off on one side , and as he obediently kept to his limitations , all proceeded happily . During this domestic scrimmage , Mrs. Bachelor went on chatting in her lively , pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she overheard the scene in the study . I was so occupied with it , that I could pay no heed to her remarks ; but she was a wise woman , and knew that her husband was being cooked to a delicious turn , and that any interference on her part , would spoil the dish . I have since learned that occasionally , when she sees that the fire is really too hot for him , she comes to his rescue . " If he sputters and fizzes , do n't be anxious ; some husbands do this till they are quite done . " Evidently Mrs. Bachelor has studied her cook-book . VII The little touch of sentiment that flashed , as it were , from Randolph Chance as he lifted me off the pier , was presently blotted , as far as effect upon me was concerned , by the return of Miss Sprig to the Purblind household , and the renewal of his attentions to her . At least I regarded them as renewed , and I coldly turned my back upon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or speculation . I was daily becoming more interested in another acquaintance  --  Mr. Gregory , a man of years , whom I had known for some time . He had been a visitor at our house when my parents were living , and had , from time to time , shown me friendly attentions since their death . He frequently invited me to places of entertainment , something Randolph Chance seldom did , and in many ways contributed to my comfort and happiness . Single women are very dependent upon their men friends for pleasures of this sort ; few of them care to go out at night alone , and even when they go in company with each other , the occasion lacks a zest which belongs to it when a woman has an escort . It is strange that many men  --  many of those who believe in the dependence of women , fall into the selfish habit of going alone to theater , concert , and lecture , and so force the women of their acquaintance into a position which their sentiments would seem to deprecate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentions , Mr. Gregory was most thoughtful and kind , and few women are without appreciation of conduct of this type . Life flowed on with me with a quiet current . I was not a woman to make scenes with myself or others , and my circumstances were such as to permit of an undisturbed tenor of way . One bright afternoon , just as I returned from a long walk , Mrs. Purblind ran over to see me , and soon afterward , Mrs. Cynic dropped in . I never could bear this latter woman ; something malevolent seems to emanate from her ; something that is more or less unhealthful to the moral nature of all who come in contact with it , just as the miasma from a swamp is poisonous to the physical being . It chanced that I had just finished writing a little story , drawn from the life-page of my domestic experience ; it was so endeared to my memory that I was not like to forget it , and yet , in the course of years , its outlines would probably fade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their distinctness ; for that reason I had written it out . I ought to have had better sense than to read anything of this kind to Mrs. Cynic . In the presence of such people , that which is fresh , beautiful , and holy withers , as a cluster of dewy wild flowers is parched and killed by the hot , sterile breath of a furnace . Usually I have some judgment in such matters , but that day all discretion seemed to take wings . A remark of Mrs. Purblind 's led up to the subject . This little woman can say ugly things at times , but they are stung out of her , as it were , by some particular hurt , and are not the expression of her real nature . She has a kind , good heart , though her judgment and tact are somewhat lacking . We happened to be speaking of men , and something was said about their capacity for devotion , when Mrs. Purblind exclaimed : " Devotion ! the masculine nature does n't know the meaning of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must read you a little story I 've written to-day . It 's a true one , remember  --  I think I shall call it , ' Devotion ' . " I went to my desk , took out the manuscript , and read as follows : " A few years ago I owned a pair of foxhounds . Duke was the gentleman of the family , and Lady was his consort , and a lady she was indeed . I can hardly imagine a human creature of greater intelligence and refinement than this dumb beast . The attachment between herself and Duke was unique in its strength , and in its demonstration . He was fully as noble and as intelligent as she , but of a less lively , cheerful temperament . The arrival of six little Dukes was an occasion of anxiety and excitement for us all , and we were much relieved when the event was safely over , and we saw Lady and her beautiful family established in peace and comfort . Matters had run smoothly for about four or five weeks , when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I knew came from Lady . I ran to the window , and saw the poor creature rolling in the middle of the street , in the greatest pain . By her side was Duke , and his outcries mingled with hers . The hard-hearted teamster , whose wagon had done the mischief , had driven off , but I ran to the rescue , and finally got her into the stable , where her little ones were awaiting her . She only lived a few hours , and her last act was an effort to nurse her clamorous doggies , while with her great , sad eyes she seemed to say good-by to Duke ! The grief of this noble fellow was so great that we thought he would go mad . For a time he refused to let us come near her . He stood over her , licking her senseless form , pushing her gently once in a while with his head and paws , and then uttering lamentable cries when he saw that she did not move , or in any way respond ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingling their voices with their father 's deep notes of distress . It was a most pitiable sight , and we all breathed a sigh of relief when the dear old fellow permitted us to lead him off into the house , and we had an opportunity to dispose of poor Lady . I 'll not try to tell of Duke 's excitement and distress when he missed her ; of his frantic search all over the place , and of how we followed him about , and talked to him , and tried to divert him ; or how we all  --  Duke , and the rest of us , finally sat down in the stable , beside the motherless little family , and wept together . " The morning after Lady died , I went out to the stable with a cup of warm milk . I had not been able to do anything with the puggy little dogs the evening before , but I thought that their sharp hunger , after several hours of abstinence , would lead them to make an effort to drink . I carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a bottle , with a nipple  --  all kinds of appliances , in fact . " What was my surprise upon entering the stable , to find Duke occupying Lady 's place . He was evidently trying to answer the small dogs ' clamorous demand for breakfast , and it was also plain that his failure in this respect amazed and bewildered him . He lay down just as he had seen Lady do , and when this did not suffice he tried another position ; failing again , he withdrew a few paces , and sat for a moment in an attitude of profound thought ; returning soon , and trying another device . This resulting unfavorably , he made still another , and then another attempt , and finally , grieved to the heart , and worried by the hungry cries of the small dogs , he withdrew once more , and lifting his nose high in air , deliberately yowled . " At this point I obtruded myself upon the scene and went up to the dear old dog , took his distressed head in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the difficulty of the situation ; how , owing to circumstances quite beyond his control , he could not take Lady 's place . I urged upon him that he must yield gracefully to his limitations ; showed him my appliances , and then when I had soothed and interested him , and he had consented to desist , and let me try , I made my essay . " It was a study for an artist  --  my appealing , pitying , impatient , scolding efforts to induce those unreasonable little creatures to accept a rag , or a bottle in place of a mother . I should n't have cared so much , that is , I could have taken longer without minding it , had it not been for Duke . His anxiety was so great , and his distress over their cries so keen , that I was quite unnerved , and as is often the case , I showed my concern by scolding and abusing the objects in whose behalf I was exerting myself . " I was all but ready to give up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a feminine creature , of course ) suddenly seized upon the nipple of the bottle with a lusty grip , and sucked away till she was all but strangled with milk . Her example was speedily followed by the others , but before I had gone the rounds Duke comprehended that our trials were ended , and then  --  well , the dignified , sad-faced old doggie took leave of his wits , temporarily , as well as his dignity . He capered , he rolled on the ground , he barked , he bayed , he played leap-frog over my head , did everything but stand on end , and very nearly that , in his joy . " From that time on he never failed to be present when his infants were fed , and when I weaned them , and taught them to drink , he was an interested spectator ; helpful too , for one time when a small dog was obdurate , he took him by the nape of the neck , and shook him thoroughly , before turning him over to me for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family drank too deep , as it were , from the flowing bowl , and might have been drowned had it not been for his watchful parent . Duke noticed that the small fore-quarters were plunged into the liquid dinner ; he also observed that the hind quarters were slowly rising in midair . He watched all this , with his accustomed , kindly gravity , until the equilibrium was lost , and Master Pup plunged into the pearly sea . Then the startled father leaped to his feet , snatched his offspring from a milky grave , and laid him , sneezing and choking , sadder and wiser , on the sunny grass-plat to dry . " In due time Duke recovered , in a measure , from his grief over Lady 's death , and took unto himself another partner . As is usual in the case of widowers , his second choice was injudicious , for Fanchon was a giddy , young thing , that did n't have sense enough to come in out of the rain . " But Duke saw no defects ; he was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the weather was intensely cold , and we had taken Duke and Fanchon in from the stable , and had housed them comfortably in the cellar . " One night I was wakened out of a sound sleep by cries of distress . I called my sister and her husband , who were visiting me , and in various costumes , all hands went below . Fanchon was running about , crying and moaning , and Duke was alternately making frantic efforts to soothe her , and kiyiying in a manner that was fearful to hear . We succeeded at last in getting Fanchon to heed us , and coaxed her to settle down in a comfortable bed we made for her on the far side of the cellar , where she would have the benefit of the warmth from the furnace , and would be out of the way of the cold air which came in through a window , broken the day before . " As soon as she was pacified , Duke was again happy , and he cheerfully lay down to rest . We retired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sightseeing during the day , dropped into a sound sleep . The next morning I hurried down into the cellar , wondering whether I should see two dogs , or a dozen . To my surprise and dismay , I saw none at all . The cellar was silent and deserted . I opened the outer door , and with a failing heart , stepped into the clear , bitter cold of a temperature something like fifteen degrees below zero . Just around the corner of the house , in a nook slightly sheltered from the biting air , I came upon the family . Fanchon lay upon the ground , the snow carefully pushed up around her , and her clinging little ones , who were taking their breakfast . Over all  --  Fanchon and her puppies  --  covering them with his faithful body  --  shielding them with his never-failing love and devotion , was my noble hound  --  as noble , as faithful a dog , as ever man or woman loved . I called to him , and rubbed him , but all in vain , and meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm bed in the cellar , looked on with cheerful indifference , and wagged her tail . " " Well , " said Mrs. Cynic , when I had concluded the reading , " that story seems to me to prove but one thing . " " And what is that , pray ? " I asked , realizing I had been foolish to read such a tale to such an auditor . " Why , the truth of Madame de Stael 's remark : ' The more I see of men , the more I admire dogs . ' " That hateful woman ! She always leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth . I know she springs from some corrupt ancestry . She has all the marks of inward decay upon her . When she had gone , Mrs. Purblind and I breathed more freely . " She does n't believe in anything good , " said Mrs. Purblind . " No , " I answered in a tone of disgust , " she has nothing within her to answer to it . " " How different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " why , you can hardly convince that woman that anyone is really mean , and goodness knows she has trouble enough to make her bitter . What a husband she 's got ! That man makes me so mad ! He 's ugly from sheer badness . " I thought for a moment , and then I assented . I really do believe that man is ugly without cause . He and his wife live at some distance from us , and I 've often visited them . I should like to give you a scene to which I was witness one evening when I was a trifle ill , and lay on a divan just out of their dining room . Mrs. Earnest is like a delicate flower that lifts its pretty face and smiles in the sunlight of love , but is bowed and broken ' neath the thunder-cloud and storm . She longs to make her home attractive , but her husband has no sympathy with this desire ; to him home is merely the place where he finds food and lodging , and a safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep under control in the business world . The efforts that this poor little wife makes , in her timid way , to start up pleasant subjects of conversation would move a rock to tears . This is the scene , as I recall it  --  a specimen scene . The family  --  husband , wife , and three little children were at dinner , as I said . " What 's been happening to-day ? anything of interest ? " asked the little wife . " Not that I know of , " was the gruff reply . Silence , broken by the occasional sound of eating implements , ensued . " Pass the bread , will you ? " he said in a short tone , directly . " See how you like this bread ; we are trying the entire wheat flour . I think it 's very nice tasting , and they claim it 's rich in nutrition . It 's warranted to make blood , bone , and muscle  --  brain , too , I believe . I 'm going to eat several pounds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This feeble joke was received in stolid silence , and the poor little wife crept into her shell . After a time she peeped out again , and made another effort . " I went to the womans ' club this afternoon ; Mrs. Pierson invited me . They had a very interesting meeting ; they brought up the subject of smoke consumers . I never realized before how much property is ruined yearly by the smoke . It does seem as if manufacturers ought to use consumers . " At this point Bruin openly yawned , and the little wife again retired . But with astonishing elasticity of courage she issued from her shell once more , this time with the hope that a more masculine theme would meet with some response . " They brought a petition around here to-day for us to sign . It seems there is some talk of flooring the reservoir and using it as a beer garden this coming summer , and the neighborhood has been called upon to protest against it . " " I know all about that , " he growled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . " Again silence fell as a wet cloak upon them , and the little woman sat there racking her brains , almost depleted by this time , for the atmosphere which such a man as that creates is warranted to dry up all the intellectual juices . One more despairing effort . The children had now left the table , so anecdotes of them were in order . Probably the poor little wife thought that this man could be wakened into attention by a story about one of his children . " Mamie asked me where cats went to when they died . ' They do n't go anywhere , ' I said ; ' when they die , that 's the end of them . ' " ' Do they turn to dust ? ' she asked . " ' Yes , just turn to dust , ' I said . " ' Why , then , ' she exclaimed , and her eyes grew as big as saucers , ' when horses run ' long the streets , are they kicking up cats ? ' " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little wife 's peal of merry laughter was checked , and the ha ha 's grew fainter and spread farther and farther apart , until they died away altogether , and I felt like charging upon that burly , surly demon , and butting him out of the window . " How would you serve such a man , if you were his wife ? " asked Mrs. Purblind . " Roasted ! " VIII Mr. Gregory 's attentions had become an accepted fact in my life . They were dignified and steadfast , and I received them with a certain calm pleasure . They had not , as yet , reached the point of declaration , but it was clear to me , and to everyone else , who knew anything about the matter , that they were tending thither , and my own thought had reached the point of acceptance . I had the greatest respect for him as a man ; we were congenial in our tastes , and personally agreeable to one another . The position he had to offer me was a most dignified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sterling integrity , but also a man of wealth ; there was , in short , everything in favor of the alliance , and I looked upon it quietly , but with a sense of substantial , and steadfast comfort . Such an event as a marriage can not even in prospect , face a thoughtful woman without making a great change in her life . Mr. Gregory was that type of man who ought not to be allowed to offer himself in a direction where there was no intention of acceptance , for his character and age  --  he was fifty or more  --  forbade all thought of lightness or trifling , and gave one the assurance that any marked attention he might show , was significant . My acquaintance with him had extended over several years , and during this period there had been abundant opportunity , on both sides , for study of character . In a quiet way , I had been arranging my affairs , preparatory to my expected change in manner of life . I had , as a matter of course , done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rapture always associated with a romantic attachment , but I was quietly happy , and this condition was a far more natural one for me , with my cool , matter-of-fact temperament  --  a far more promising one , in respect to future enjoyment , I felt , than something more ecstatic . I had seen but little of Mr. Chance for some weeks . He had called several times , but on each of these occasions , we had passed a somewhat constrained , and I thought , a rather dull evening . Just why this constraint should have crept into our intercourse when we seemed to be coming to a better understanding than heretofore , and were beginning to enjoy a warmer degree of friendship than we had known , I could not understand ; but its presence was undeniable , and it spoiled everything for me , as far as he was concerned , causing me to look upon his calls in the light of a bore , rather than as a pleasure , as I once had done . Occasionally a memory of that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cruel waves gathered like wolves about me , would flit across my mind , as a shadow may flit across a sunlit hill . Once in a long while I found myself dwelling upon the look he gave me that night , and this , and the memory of his touch , as he lifted me off the pier , would dim the sunshine of my cheerfulness . I could not have explained this to myself , and I never dwelt upon the thought ; whether from disinclination , or from fear , I could not tell . I only knew that I always turned from it abruptly , and passed on to my plans affecting my life with Mr. Gregory . It was quite easy to plan in this direction , for there was nothing uncertain , as there might have been in the case of a younger man . Mr. Gregory was fixed in his tastes , and way of life ; I , too , at my age , had formed settled habits , and this he knew ; but , fortunately , in most directions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had fallen into a way of making certain concessions . So I had matters pretty well laid out ; all my theories , born of years of close observation of affairs domestic , were now brought to bear on my own future . Secretly I esteemed myself a competent cook , when a husband was the dish under discussion . Mr. Gregory was not one to require any very complicated wisdom in the culinary art . A little gentle stewing ; no strong seasoning ; no violent changes or methods of any sort ; but regularity , evenness ; quiet affection ; respect ; comfort , and general conformance to taste and nature would be necessary , and I felt myself fully equal to it all . Matters had well-nigh culminated , for I had received a note from Mr. Gregory asking when I would be at home to him , and saying that he had a matter of great moment to both of us , to lay before me . I set an evening , and then awaited his coming without the slightest quickening of my pulse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense as the surest forecast of happiness . Just at this juncture , a swift turn of the wind-cock , or some imprudence of diet , resulted in my taking cold  --  a most unusual procedure for me , and at the time of Mr. Gregory 's call I was unable to see him , being confined to my bed , in the care of a doctor , who was fighting a case of threatened pneumonia . Mr. Gregory expressed his sincere regret , and the next day called again , and left flowers . These attentions were repeated daily , and soon after hearing of my improvement , he wrote me a letter in which he said that which he had intended to say on the evening of the day I fell ill . He did not request a reply ; in fact , he asked me to withhold my answer until I should be able to see him in person . It would have been wiser , perhaps , he said , to have postponed any word on the subject until I had recovered , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me , and hence had written . This last rather surprised me , for Mr. Gregory had always seemed so unlikely to be swayed by impulse , or carried , in the slightest degree , beyond a point indicated by his judgment . It simply went to prove that the most regularly and smoothly laid-out man , if one may so express it , has unsuspected crooks and turns . I had no desire to answer the letter , being perfectly able and willing to wait until I should see him . In fact , instead of hastening the time for my acceptance , I rather delayed it , for I reached a point in my convalescence , when I was able to go down to the parlor , had I so wished , and still did not . Each day of my illness , a lovely bouquet of flowers had been left at my door . They came direct from the greenhouse , and were left without card , or sign of the giver . I had an eccentric little friend who was quite devoted to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the performances of its counterpart  --  the right hand  --  and I attributed this delicate and beautiful token of sympathy and affection to her ; but , for some inexplicable reason , every morning when the flowers were brought to my room , and I took them in my hand , a strange feeling came over me  --  a feeling I had never had toward my little friend . Over two weeks had passed , and I was downstairs in the study . My nurse had gone out , my housekeeper was busy , and I was very lonely . I was standing at the window , looking westward . The sun had gone down in regal splendor . Some fete was in progression in the sky , for the attendants of the god of day were resplendent in attire . They had been marshalled from all quarters of the heavens , and their stately and solemn procession , brilliant with the most gorgeous red , royal purple , and dazzling gold , had caused my heart to dilate with awe and reverential admiration . The lake , stirred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped from heaven , and tossed them on high in joyous , iridescent waves . The climax of majesty and beauty was reached , and then the convocation broke up  --  not suddenly , but slowly , and with gracious dignity . The sun sank into the waiting arms of the unknown ; the lights of heaven faded , and the clouds slowly melted into dusk . The scene had stirred me as I am seldom stirred , and with the oncoming of night new thoughts and feelings rose from their lair , as strange and beautiful wild animals step from their caves into the deep mystery of darkness . My neighbor next door  --  Mrs. Thrush , sat on her broad , vine-clad gallery , rocking her little child in her arms . By her side sat her husband , with one arm thrown across her lap . He had laid his paper down , for the daylight was fading , and perhaps his thought was too happy to stoop to daily news . Softly the little wife and mother sang ; she had a sweet home voice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lullaby . I was at that moment an intensely lonely woman . I thought of Mr. Gregory and my future , and still I was lonely . Far away to the east there was a low , long bank of clouds like a mountain range , and as the poetry and melody of the lullaby rose from the little nest on my left , and stole into my thought , I saw a faint light above this line ; then a group of mist-like clouds that moved toward me . Slowly the gray haze , tinged with soft light , began to resolve itself into shadowy forms , and my heart stood still as , in some vague way , I traced a connection between the lullaby and the vision , and realized that a message was coming to me . I was perfectly calm , but with the calmness which is the outgrowth of an excitement so tense that it is still . As the vision floated nearer , I heard soft music  --  a crooning , yearning , soul-satisfying lullaby ; I saw a little child , a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an angel , and there was that in its face which made my eyes flood with tears , and my heart ache with yearning ; the faces of the parents were too vague for me to recognize at first ; then slowly , that of the mother became more distinct , and I saw myself before me  --  myself , a wife and mother ; the visible answer to my heart 's deepest , most secret cry . Still the father 's face was hidden , but as the vision floated by , he turned and looked at me  --  the vision wife  --  with a look I had seen before , and I uttered a cry as I recognized Randolph Chance . IX As I cried out , I turned slightly and , for a moment , lost the picture . It was changed when again I saw it ; Randolph Chance was still there , but he no longer advanced toward the vision wife  --  she had faded into mist ; he came slowly toward me . There was a beautiful look on his face  --  I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into language ; but I could feel it vibrate through my being until it set my very soul a-quivering . I had no power of resistance  --  no wish to resist . I almost think I went toward him , and he was as real to me as if he were in the flesh . I could feel him as he put his arm around my waist , and his face touched mine . The vision child had melted away ; and we two were alone ; I knew my heart then ; I knew I loved this man . It was all over in a few moments , but such moments as make an eternity , for they wipe out the past , even as death blots out a life , and they open a door to the future . Up to that time I had never thought that , without my knowledge or intent , my heart could slip from me  --  had never dreamed that I , whose life had always been most commonplace  --  I , who had had my share of wooing , but had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never dreamed that I , this I , so practical and sensible , could be carried off my feet by a vision . A vision , was it ? Yes , and yet real , too real in some ways , since it revealed my innermost thought . A vision ! And yet , even now that it had melted into air , I was clinging to it , and instead of resenting its startling revelation of self , was dwelling upon it , and in it , with a delight beyond words . I sat there in my study , my head bent , and my hands loosely clasped in my lap , living it over and over again . Out of doors , the soft gray dusk had hushed the tired world in its arms . Within , the stillness of night had settled down upon the room . By and by the moon rose above the great waters of the lake , and on shore the trees were casting silent , solemn shadows , made visible by the soft , hazy light that lay between them . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some little brooding note , and over on the vine-clad gallery , Mrs. Thrush still crooned a lullaby to her little child , who lay asleep  --  soft and warm , on her mother-breast . I was no longer lonely , no longer shut out from it all  --  there was the bird on its nest ; the little wife and mother in her home ; and I  --  I was very near them  --  akin to them . I had seen myself in my home , with my child , and my husband ; I had felt his dear arms about me , and his dear face close to mine . I was no longer an alien . I , too , had a place in the heart of another . Still I sat and dreamed , and even the ringing of my door-bell failed to rouse me : but when I heard the maid say to someone : " She has been downstairs to-night , but I think she has gone up now , and I do n't like to call her . " I started forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will see any one . " And so he came in , but it was not the one I expected . It was Mr. Gregory . I think that he found my embarrassment on greeting him both gratifying and encouraging , but its cause was alien to his thought . I was brought back from another world , as it were , with a rude shock , and in my enfeebled condition , consequent upon a severe illness could not control myself . Indeed I did not feel that I was mistress of myself at any time during the evening . After a word or two , which I can not recall , I stammered out : " I was not expecting you this evening  --  I had not sent for you . " " I know that you have not , " he answered  --  then dropping his voice a trifle , he added , " I could not wait any longer  --  I found it difficult to wait so long as this . I hardly dared hope that I might see you this evening , but I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of a spoken declaration , I exclaimed : " Oh , Mr. Gregory , do n't ! please do n't say anything more . I am not deserving of your esteem and kindness . " He came nearer me , and his voice was at once tender and reverent , as he said : " You are more than worthy of what I have to offer , which is myself , and all that I have . " " Do n't ! " I cried again ; " do n't say anything more ! Let us imagine this unsaid ! " " Such words can never be recalled , " he said gravely . " They must be , " I persisted ; " I can not accept ! I have nothing to give in return ! " A look of disappointment came over his face , and if I mistake not , it was shaded with displeasure . " I hardly expected this , Miss Leigh , I have hardly been led to expect this . " " I know what you mean , Mr. Gregory , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know that I have accepted your attentions  --  you have had every reason to expect a different answer . I 'll not try to deceive you , or keep anything from you . I 'll tell you that I have not been trifling . I have understood you for some time  --   --  " He interrupted me here . " Yes , you must have done so ; my attentions to you could have but one interpretation , if I were a man of honor , and you knew I was that . " " I did , indeed , " I exclaimed . And then my mind went , with a flash like lightning , to Randolph Chance , and I felt a sudden resentment . Had not he shown me attentions that no man of honor can bestow upon a woman , unless he wishes to make her his wife ? Why had he left me in this strait ? Why had he not spoken out ? Why had he not claimed before the world that which he had taken such pains to win ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mr. Gregory . Why ? Because I had perfect confidence in his honor . Was he not the better man  --  the more trustworthy ? Why could I not marry him ? I loved another man . A wave of shame and anger swept my face . " I have all along been expecting to marry you . I have not been trifling , " I cried out . He stepped forward , and took my hand . It was as cold as ice . " What is it then , Constance , that has changed you ? Have I done anything since your illness to make you think less of me ? " I trembled from head to foot , and my lips were so stiff and dry that they scarce would do my bidding . I must have spoken very indistinctly . " No  --  no , " I said slowly ; " I will tell you everything  --  I have done you a wrong , an unintentional wrong , but I will do penance  --  I have seen myself to-night  --  " I paused here ; Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a vision had changed my attitude , he would have thought me insane . I myself had begun to entertain doubts as to my sanity . " I know myself now , " I faltered , " I know my heart  --  I love another man . " Mr. Gregory rose , and began pacing the floor . " This surprises me greatly , " he said at length ; " there must have been another courtship  --  it would seem that you must have known something of how matters were tending . " " I have known nothing until to-night . There has been no courtship , in the ordinary acceptation of that word  --  I 'll tell you all , even if it humbles me completely , as a penalty for what I have done to you . The man I love  --  " I could feel the blood mantling my face and neck , " has never addressed me . " Mr. Gregory paused , and looked at me . " This is extraordinary , " he said . " It is  --  I know it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is wholly unlike what I have been all my life . " " Let us not talk of this any more to-night , Miss Leigh , " he said , with evident relief ; " I have been wrong to press this matter now , when you are hardly recovered . You are not yourself . This is something transitory , no doubt . Later on , you may feel differently . " " No , no ! " I exclaimed eagerly , " now that we have begun , let us say it all . Do n't  --  I beg of you , do n't go away with a feeling that I do n't know my mind . I am weak and miserable to-night  --  " here the tears choked my voice , and I all but broke down , " but I am miserable because I have learned my true feeling , and know that I must disappoint  --   --  " I could not go on , and again he sat down beside me and took my hand . " I can not understand you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I replied ; " but all this is none the less real for that . I have learned of it to-night , but it has existed before ; it explains many things in the past year . " " If that is the case , then I must accept your decision as final . " " It is , indeed , " I answered briefly . He rose , and walked the room in silence again ; then pausing once more , he said calmly , and with no trace of anger . " This is the disappointment of my life . " I said nothing . What could I say ? To utter any platitudes about being sorry , would have been to insult him . " A man can not live to my age  --  I am fifty-two , Miss Leigh  --  without experiencing disappointment , but I have known nothing equal to this . " He paced the room a few moments , and then said : " This interview must be distressing to you . I am very sorry I brought it about before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you go , Mr. Gregory , " I cried , " only say that you do n't think I have willfully misled you  --  say that you respect me still . " His face was stirred by a slight quiver , as a placid lake is stirred by an impulse of the evening air . " You have had , and you always will have my deepest respect , and my deepest affection . " He took my hand silently , and then quietly left the room . And I sat there until I heard the front door close . Then I went upstairs , but I remember nothing after reaching the first landing . They found me lying there . They said I must have fainted . X I was badly upset for several days . For a time I resolutely put all thought of what had occurred from my mind , but as soon as I felt able , I sat down , with the whole matter before me , as it were , and deliberately looked it in the face . I think I never felt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I now regarded it . All that saved me from utter self-abasement was the fact that it had occurred at a time when I was at such a low ebb physically , by reason of illness . I determined to try to forget it , as speedily as possible . But , however keenly I felt the humiliation and folly of my emotion upon that strange night , it never occurred to me to waver , when recalling my decision to bring matters between Mr. Gregory and myself to an end . My refusal of him had been brought about by one cause , and only one  --  that I fully realized ; and now that I had repudiated the cause , I might have been expected to reconsider the refusal . But I did not . Soon after I was up and about once more , I learned that my little friend had not sent the flowers . I thought  --  no , I did not think ! but I cherished secretly a  --  well , no ! I cherished nothing in secret or in public ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was that a story was going the rounds to the effect that Mr. Gregory had broken our engagement  --  and my disappointment had well-nigh occasioned me a relapse . But in a twinkling , almost before I had time to get indignant , Mrs. Catlin was running about , telling everybody that Mr. Gregory had confided in her , in strictest confidence , the truth of the matter , which was that I had ended the affair , and not he . I was much moved by this manly act on Mr. Gregory 's part . He showed his shrewdness , too ; he could not announce this in public , or go to people one by one , so he confided it to Mrs. Catlin , and told her not to tell . One Sabbath evening about ten o'clock , I began to lock up the house . Early retirement is something all but unknown to me , but that night , having no particular reason for sitting up , I was about to indulge in it as a novelty . I raised the shade of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my hand paused in the act , for my eyes were captured by a scene of surpassing beauty . Fall had lately swept her gorgeous leaves one side , and closed her doors for the season , and we were now standing on the threshold of winter . The early snows are apt to be soft and clinging ; it is later on , usually , when the thermometer takes a plunge downward , that they become crisp and hard . It is seldom , however , at any time of year that the atmospheric conditions are favorable to such a creation as I beheld that night . I hardly know just what is necessary to make it all  --  a still , moderate cold , and a very humid air are among the most important conditions , I believe . When I stepped outside my door early in the evening , the air all about me seemed to be snow , not separated into flakes , but diffused evenly . Altogether it had the effect of a heavy white fog , and I could see even then , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only upon the ground , but upon every bush and tree as well . It was a most unusual scene , and I gazed at it long and admiringly ; but having no fondness for walking through soft , clinging snow , I was not enticed to sally forth , as I always am when the snow is firm and sparkling . But by ten o'clock the temperature had changed , and in the cooler air the almost imperceptible melting of the snow had been stayed . The white carpet that had slowly been sinking , was now stationary , and was covered by a firm crust that gleamed in the moonlight . There was no sparkle on the trees , but the feathery tufts and pinions had ceased floating to the ground , and melting into air . The scene , in all its matchless beauty , was arrested  --  held upon nature 's canvas for a few hours , by the Master hand . Stay in doors that night ! Would I be so wicked as to turn my back , or close my eyes upon one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread before the soul of human creature ! Would I deliberately slight such an exhibition of love and marvelous skill ? Not I ! It did n't take me long to catch up hat and jacket , and with a heart that beat high , slip from my house , as a greyhound slips the leash , and his me away . What mattered it that the neighborhood lights were raised  --  a story , at least  --  and that the owners of all the villas near at hand , were preparing for decorous , temporary retirement . I merely pitied them for their stupidity , and went my way . I had long been a law unto myself , and while I did not believe in flaunting my independence in their faces , I none the less continued to enjoy it . There are nights when to sleep would be the sin of an ingrate ; ' t would be like gathering up the good things of Providence , and hurling them from out the window , in reckless waste . And this night was such a one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to run in a subtle , fascinating torrent through my veins , and lend me wings . I felt as though I were buoyed up by magic hands ; I hardly think I set foot on ground the whole way , and yet I must , for I was conscious of a crisp crackle of the snow at every step . Oh , is there any sound just like it ! Could our poor invalids but pitch their nostrums over the wall , and take this tonic instead ! Some friends of mine moved a while ago and drove their family stake in a spot far off from here . They are continually writing me of a region of perpetual sunshine and summer . I thought of them on this glorious night , and pitied them from the depths of my heart , as I often have , indeed , since they went out there . Theirs is the place for the extremely indigent , no doubt , but for any one who can command a dollar or so for fuel , this  --  this is the land of delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our suburb was beautiful throughout , especially all along by the lake , but there was one place in particular , where art and nature had joined hands , with a result indescribable . Toward these grounds I hastened , on this particular night . Oh , the glory of that moon ! the glory of the lake ! an undulating sea of waves , each crested with a feather , as soft , as snowy in the moonlight , as the tinier ones that hung upon the trees . I ran down the winding avenue  --  the white fog still lingered in the deep places , but above , all was clear and glorious . Erelong I entered the Dunham 's grounds . At a certain point , unmarked to the stranger 's eye , a rustic flight of stairs , now strewn with dead leaves  --  padded with snow as well , to-night , dips down from the broad driveway . Quickly I made my way by this path , and erelong , stood upon one of the little rustic bridges spanning the ravine , and connecting with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There I paused , and well I might . It were a dull , plodding creature indeed , who would not be spellbound by such a scene ! On either hand were the sloping wooded sides of the ravine whose depths were shrouded in the mysterious whiteness of the fog ; above me , a short distance in front , was the arch of the broad , picturesque bridge with which the driveway spans the hollow . The little rustic bridge on which I stood was much lower than the larger one ; hence , from my position , I looked through the archway , beyond , down , and far along the ravine . Can you call up fairyland to your mental eye ? It would pale before this scene  --  those feathery trees ! that enchanting vista ! I stood there drinking it in , and pitying the sleeping world . I could not , even in thought , express my delight and gratitude for being permitted to behold such beauty , but finally a familiar line leaped from my lips : " Praise God from whom all blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it kindled and warmed my heart with a reverential fire . If , in the course of years , my way should be overcast ; if , for a time , I should let the artificial  --  the ignoble , clog the path , and shut me out from the light of heaven , even then I shall be saved from doubt , which is always engendered by our stupidity  --  the things of our own manufacture  --  I shall be saved from doubt by the sweet , pure , radiant memory of that winter , moonlight scene . Only a beneficent God could create such beauty . XI On my way back  --  at what dissipated hour I firmly decline to state  --  I passed a home with an interesting history tacked thereto . The leading events were brought me by one of those active , inquisitive little birds that find out all sorts of things , and often fetch from great distances . The couple who live there , though Americans , once lived in Winnipeg , Manitoba , and it was in that place that the husband fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bird that acts as a kind of domestic ferret  --  told me that , in the early years of their married life , the wife was of an excitable , hysterical temperament , and given to making scenes . Just here let me digress a moment to erect a warning signboard . I have a friend who is busy mixing and administering a deadly draught to her domestic happiness , and yet does not know it . She has only been married a year , and she uses tears and scenes , in general , as instruments to pull from her husband the attention , affection , and devotion she craves . The tug waxes increasingly hard , but she has not , as yet , sense enough to see that , and desist . She can not realize that the success attained by such methods is but the temporary and external beauty , which , in reality , covers a failure of the most hopeless type , just as the flush on the consumptive 's cheek is but a pitiable counterfeit , and covers a fatal disease . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's early blunders be true or false , there seems to be no doubt that presently the husband grew careless and indifferent ; that scene followed scene between them , until at last he went to drinking . Then the little wife waxed sober , thoughtful , and studied much within herself . This awful sorrow , following so closely upon the heels of her wedding-day joy , matured her judgment  --  her womanhood , and she began to use every skillful device to call back her husband from the dark paths he had chosen , to the light . All in vain , however ; and when she realized this , after several years of heroic effort , she made one last scene , and told him she was going to leave him . Then his old-time tenderness returned  --  if you can compare a tenderness which was blurred and cringing , with that which was clear and manly . He begged and promised in vain , however , for she had lost faith , and a lost faith is not found again for many a day . So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so carefully that no anxious , heartbroken effort of his could find her . Meanwhile she wrote him frequently and regularly , and although he knew not where to send reply , it is quite likely she had word of him from some one to whom she had given her confidence in this dreary time . And so five years passed , and at their close she walked into her home one day , and her husband  --  a man once more , took her in his arms , and looked his love and joy with clear , honest eyes . They came to our city , or rather this little suburb of our city , soon afterward , and although it is well-nigh ten years now that they have been among us , there has never been a hint of trouble . Hers was a unique method , but it brought about the desired end . Verily it would seem that for some dinners , it is best for the cook to vanish , and leave the dishes to get themselves . I was meditating on this as I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the recollection of all I had seen and felt , was moved to write out a story given me by a young man  --  a friend of mine , who lives at a great distance from here , on an olive ranch out of Los Gatos , California . I wish I could give you this little tale just as he told it . I ca n't , I know , but I 'll do my best in trying . Mrs. Purblind dropped in just as I was reading it over to myself , before my study fire . " Do you remember my story about Duke ? " I asked . " Yes , I liked it , " she said , " though I 'm not very partial to dogs . " " I have one here about horses . I 've written it out as nearly as possible as my friend told it to me , but so much flavor is lost when these things change hands . Here it is , and I think that the lamentation David sang over Saul , might head it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  work horses , and yet , by reason of the strength of their affections , they were lifted from out the commonplace , and enveloped with an atmosphere of romance that gave them the flavor of a story book , plumb full of princes and heroes . And by the way , Prince was the name of one of them , and he was a genuine hero , as you will see . His mate was called Nelly , and albeit she was as awkward and as angular as the ideal old maid , vastly inferior to Prince , who was a fine-looking chap , yet his admiration for her was unbounded . She cared for him , I 'm sure , but she was less demonstrative ; more coquettish , I would say , if she had n't been too homely a beast to think of , in connection with such a word . " They were brought up together ; were taught by the same master ; sat on the same bench , in a figurative sense ; were lovers from the very first . Prince certainly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at all times , and his courtesy to her savored of the old school . He would n't go into the shed of a cold , rainy day and leave Nelly outside ; but if she went in , he was more than content to follow . When it was necessary to separate them  --  we could n't always work them together  --  we had to tie Prince with ropes and cables , as it were , to hold him fast . Nelly was less difficult to manage ; at least , she would let him go out of sight without fretting , and yet , after all , she seemed easier if he were at hand . I remember , one day , he was tied in front of the house , and she was loose , grazing near by . As long as he could see her , all went well enough , but the moment she sauntered around the fence , he began first to fidget , then to paw and neigh , and finally to struggle , until in the end , he broke loose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made over her ! whinnying , and demonstrating his delight in a dozen different ways . She ? oh , she took it coolly , but that was all feminine bosh , or coquetry on her part . She liked to have him near her well enough . " There was an amusing thing happened one day , down in the field . Father and I were plowing with Nell . We had tied Prince to a tree , the other side of the knoll we were working on , and supposed he was fast , but to our surprise , just as we turned , after finishing a long furrow , we confronted the gentleman , tree and all , standing before us in a weak and fainting condition . He had struggled until he had uprooted the whole business , and was so used up in consequence , that he could hardly stagger , much less go into his usual hysterics over Nell . She looked as amazed as we did , and I 've no doubt gave him a sound curtain lecture on his folly that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . Steve and I stayed up near the house , working around the vineyard . Nelly was in the stable . " The morning was half gone , when all at once Steve happened to turn around , and look down the hill . " ' Gosh , Jack ! ' he exclaimed , ' the barn 's afire . ' " I gave one startled look , and then ran for the hose . " ' Get Nelly out ! ' I cried to Steve ; but after a second look , I called , ' No , do n't you do it ! Let her go ! it 's too late ! ' " ' I wo n't let her go ! ' he shouted ; ' do you think I 'll stand by and see Nelly burned to death ! ' " ' You 'd be a fool to go in now ! Look at that stable ! Here ! Stand back ! Have you lost your wits ? ' " ' Let me go ! ' he cried ; ' Jack , get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held him . I was bigger than he ; older , and cooler-headed too . " ' There , I give in , ' he said in a moment ; ' it 's wicked to lose time this way . Let me up , Jack , and we 'll get the hose . I promise you I wo n't go in . ' " We ran for the hose , and turned on all the water we could command , and by this time mother and the servant girl had come from the house , and were helping us . " We could hear Nelly struggling in her stall , and I tell you it made us sick ! Unluckily we had chained her , in anticipation of her trying to get loose , and go after Prince . She 'd never been left at home this way before , and we 'd taken extra pains to secure her . " The stable doors were fastened by a heavy bolt ; again and again I tried to push it back , but it was so fiery hot I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flames drove me off . " There was nothing for it but to leave poor Nelly to her fate . It seemed as if she divined our intent , for , as we turned away , she uttered a piercing scream . Mother burst into tears . " ' I ca n't stand it , ' she said , covering her ears . " Again and again Nelly 's voice rang out . Steve stood there , his face drawn and white . All at once he took out his watch . " ' It 's twelve o'clock ! ' he cried ; ' father 'll be home in a moment , and if Prince hears Nelly he 'll go mad . Head ' em off , Jack ! ' " I did n't wait for another word , but ran with all my might down the road by which they always came . " As fate would have it , they had chosen the other one that day , and were well along , before I caught sight of them . Father had taken Prince out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had . He was driving him , and Ned was walking behind . I saw Steve running toward them , but he was still at a distance . " ' Father , ' I yelled at the top of my voice , ' stop ! father ! the stable 's on fire . Turn Prince back . Nelly is burning ! ' " Father did n't seem to understand , for although he listened , he kept driving slowly on . " I shouted again , running toward them , and gesticulating frantically . All at once Ned caught my meaning , and bounding like a deer in front of the gig , grabbed Prince by the head to turn him , but at that very moment a terrible scream from poor Nelly split our ears , and in less time than it takes to tell there was a maddened horse plunging in midair , with four strong men clinging to him , trying to hold him back . " ' Let him go , boys ! Let him go ! ' shouted father ; ' it 's no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll kill us all ! ' " ' Oh , God ! I ca n't let the old fellow burn up ! ' sobbed Steve . " But Prince had begun to lay about him with his teeth , and father knocked Steve down to get him out of the way . " I believe we all sobbed , as we watched the old hero go up that hill and into the stable ; Nelly was quiet now , and the doors were down . " We heard him groan once or twice , and then mother came to meet us , and took us all into the house . " It 's out yonder  --  the monument we put up . It 's over both of them . " " Well , what has that horse story to do with men ? " asked a sneering voice , when I had finished my little tale , and Mrs. Purblind and I were sitting silent . I turned , and to my astonishment and disgust saw Mrs. Cynic , who had come in quietly , unobserved by me , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , but Mrs. Purblind thought to avert an awkward situation , so she said : " It illustrates the devotion of the masculine nature , I suppose . " " In horses ? Yes ; it 's a pity that it has n't been evoluted into men . " " It has , " I answered curtly , " for those who are capable of seeing and appreciating it . " This probably made her angry , for she turned on me with her most evil expression : " It 's a mystery to me why , with your overweening admiration for the other sex , you have n't married , Miss Leigh . You must have had countless opportunities ; child-like faith , such as yours , must be very attractive to them . " I stared at her a moment in silence ; her insolence stupefied me . Then I think I opened the nearest window , and pitched her out . Mrs. Purblind insists I did not do that , exactly , but that I got rid of her . As she has n't been in since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much care what the method may have been . I aired my house the rest of the day , having a wish to cleanse it , and protect my moral nature , much as one would rid a place of sewer gas , to protect the physical being . I was not in a very good temper after all this , and it annoyed me to see Randolph Chance coming in before taking his train . He had been calling oftener than usual of late , but he did n't seem to have much to say , and so his coming gave no especial pleasure . To-day what talk we had ran on flowers for a time , when Mr. Chance , awkwardly and out-of-placedly , asked me how I liked the Reve d'or rose . This was the kind of rose I had received every morning , during my illness . I looked at him inquiringly . I confess my heart was beating faster . He flushed , and said abruptly : " You must have known I sent you those . " " I did not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or note with them . " " I thought you 'd know , " he said with increasing embarrassment ; and then he added , almost desperately , " you must know , Constance , that I love you . " " I know nothing , " I replied , drawing myself up haughtily ; " I take nothing of this kind for granted . If you want me to understand , you must come out openly . " " I have done enough , surely , " he said , " enough to lead you to guess the truth . " " I guess nothing of this sort ! " I reiterated ; " what right have you to place me in this position ? What right have you , or any other man to deprive a woman of one of her dearest privileges  --  that of being wooed ? " " Constance ! " he cried , and all his embarrassment was gone , " are n't there a thousand ways of saying ' I love you ? ' and have n't I said it in every way but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , " I answered ; " I would have given more to hear those words than to receive every other token . " His face lighted up with a sudden flash , and he started impulsively toward me . " Then you do love me , my darling  --  I have hardly dared to hope . " But I drew back , and answered passionately , " No , I do not ! I love no man who can trifle with a young girl , or any woman  --  no man who has the effrontery to expect some one to take for granted a courtship that has never existed ! " " For Heaven 's sake , what do you mean ? " " Go to Miss Sprig and inquire ; she has more reason to take your love for granted than I. " " I 'll not go to her , but I shall leave you , " he said , with a white face . " You certainly do n't care for me , or you would never deal me such an unjust thrust as this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think the neighborhood heard him . I walked to the window . He was gone . I told myself I was glad of it  --  that a good lesson had been taught . Which of us was teacher remained somewhat obscure . XII It might reasonably be supposed that the event last narrated disturbed my life . It did in a measure , and for a time , but I was not very long in bringing it back to its accustomed channel . Strange as it may seem , although we lived across the street from one another , I saw nothing of Mr. Chance for many weeks . Perhaps it is not strange though , after all , since each of us was taking pains to avoid the other , and we knew each other 's habits of life pretty well by this time . But if I did n't see him , I heard of him frequently enough , for Mrs. Purblind rarely ever met me without saying something about " Dolph , " as she called him . She was exceedingly fond of him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoughtful , unselfish brother . He was very different from her , and they were not confidential friends , when serious matters were concerned , but they were companionable , nevertheless . It is not likely Mrs. Purblind realized that she was shut out from something that deeply concerned her brother ; but she worried about him . She was certain he was ill  --  he had little appetite , and was in no way like himself , she said . Miss Sprig wondered what had come over him . I believe Mrs. Purblind must have been deaf as well as blind , otherwise the neighborhood gossip regarding Mr. Chance and myself , which was rife a year ago , would certainly have reached her . Evidently she had heard nothing , and she continued to keep my innermost breast in a secret ferment , by pouring her fears and speculations into my ear . She even confided in me that she had for a long time suspected the existence of an affair between Miss Sprig and her brother , but this young woman declared that he never paid her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been very kind to her , very jolly , and friendly , but that was all . I think that if Mount Vesuvius had leaped out of me , and taken its departure , I could scarce have felt more relieved . I really had been harboring a volcano for some time , and it was a hot tenant . Shortly after hearing this latter piece of Mrs. Purblind 's news , another bit was added . " Dolph has gone away , " she said , one day ; " left suddenly , this morning . He confessed to being played out , and I 'm sure he looks it . He 's gone on to Buffalo , to brother Dave 's . " That night I sat down and wrote a letter ; when one has done wrong , his first conscious act should be to confess . I was in a trying position ; one is at such a time . Two months had elapsed , and Mr. Chance might have changed his mind and intent . Men do , occasionally ; women , too . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , that is the supposition when a man , with any real manhood about him , tells a woman he loves her  --  when he shows her marked attentions , in fact ; but , as I said to Mr. Chance , I did not intend to take such things for granted . I had not changed in that respect . I had , however , become convinced that I was harsh and unjust to him . It is a blundering teacher who takes badness in a child for granted  --  does not wait for proof . It is an inspired teacher who ignores the bad sometimes , even after it has been proven . To think the worst , so some of the psychologists tell us , will often create the worst . Even a cook does well to make the most of her materials . Her dishes will be likely to turn out ill , if she treats the ingredients with disrespect . It would seem that I , who had in a manner made a specialty of matrimonial cookery , had something yet to learn . Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said that time and thought had shown me I had done him a wrong , and that I was very sorry ; that , no doubt , he had changed in some feelings , and it was , perhaps , not likely we should meet very soon ; but that I wished him to know I realized my mistake , and that I was still his friend . The second day after I had written , I heard from him ; our letters were penned the same night , and must have crossed each other . In his he said he had held off as long as he could , but was coming right back from Buffalo to see me . He was certain he could explain everything ; he had nothing to hide , and he hoped I would let him tell me what was in his heart ; that for months he had known but one real wish , one real aspiration  --  to win me for his wife . He begged me to let him begin anew , and make an effort to attain this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at my study window . I could look into the parlor of the Thrush home . A shadow had fallen upon that dear nest ; one of the little birdies had flown away , but it was now forever sheltered from all storms in the dear Christ 's bosom , so all was well . The gentle little mother was nearly crushed at first , even more so than the father , though he felt the loss deeply ; but erelong she lifted her sweet face , and smiled through her tears . And now , at the end of two weeks , she was to her husband , at least , as cheerful as ever , even more tender , and she made the home as bright as before . So many women are selfish in their grief , unwise too . They act as if their husbands were aliens , and did not share the sorrow . It is true the man usually recovers sooner than the woman from such a blow , but no one should blame him for that . His nature is different , necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has to be ; his is the outside battle ; he must needs be rugged . But " a man 's a man for a ' that , " and the woman who shuts him out in the hour of bereavement , or who darkens the home continuously , and overcasts its good cheer , is both selfish and foolish . In such cases husband and wife are parted , instead of being brought nearer to one another , as they should be when they have a little ambassador in the court of Heaven . My heart was very tender that evening , and as I sat beside the glowing fire , before the lamps were lighted , my thoughts ran to Mrs. Purblind . The poor little woman had seemed sad of late , and I guessed , without word from her , that it was because her husband was going out so much at night . I did wish she could see some things as they really were . She sat there with me that evening  --  in spirit , at least , on the opposite side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He does n't seem to care for his home , " she said sadly . " Make him care for it . Man is a domestic animal . If he does n't stay at home , something is wrong . " " I do all I can , " she answered in a dull tone . " No doubt you do now , " I said ; " but learn more , and then you will improve . " " I was looking over some trunks in the attic to-day , and I came across my wedding gown . It called up so much ! I ca n't get over it  --  " and she sobbed aloud . I could n't speak just then . The tears were too near . " Oh , when first I wore that gown , how happy I was , and how I looked forward to the future ! Everything was bright then , but now it 's so changed that I 'd hardly know it was the same  --  it is n't the same  --  I 'm not the same , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over , and laid my hand on hers . You know she was n't really there ; the real Mrs. Purblind seldom talked over her affairs with me , but I could feel what she was suffering , none the less . " I want to tell you something , if I may , " I said . She assented in a dumb sort of fashion , and I leaned a little nearer . The firelight gleamed on the walls , and in its glow the pictures looked down kindly upon us . Soft shadows rested in the corners of the room , and an air of peace and comfort brooded throughout , as a bird upon her nest . " Think a little while , " I said gently ; " think of his side . Is he quite the same as he was when he married ? " " Oh , no ! " she exclaimed ; " he was so loving and attentive then . " " Had he any hopes and plans ? Enthusiasm ? Did life look bright to him ? " A serious look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new thought . " Look at him as he used to be , " I continued . And as I spoke , she saw that a young man with a fresh , sunny face  --  a healthy , happy , care-free face  --  was sitting in the ruddy firelight . She gave a start . " That is Joe as he used to be ! " she said . " Oh , how he 's changed ! " Even as she spoke , the young man faded away , and an older man  --  much older , apparently , careworn , and unhappy-looking  --  took his place . The coals in the glowing grate sank , and the bright light suddenly died . A deep shadow rested upon the figure beside us ; he was with us , and yet seemed so alone . " Who would think a man could change that way in ten years ! " exclaimed Mrs. Purblind ; " would you believe it possible ? " " Not unless he had known many disappointments , and borne loads and cares beyond his years . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I believe poor Joe has been disappointed too . " " He certainly has . " " It 's too bad , and there 's no help for it now , " she added with a sob . " Do n't say that , " I urged , laying my hand on hers again ; " you close the gate of heaven when you say ' no hope . ' There is always hope as long as there is a spark of life  --  any physician will tell you that . If you can be patient  --  be strong to bear , and wait  --  if you can make home bright , and not care , or not seem to care if he slights it and you , for weeks  --  months , maybe years  --  it takes so much longer to undo , than to do  --  there is every hope . He could n't do this , but a woman  --  a real woman , is strong enough , with God on her side . " The dullness left her face , and an unselfish light dawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leaned over the other figure , and he looked up at her , with something of the old-time love . I replenished the fire after they had gone  --  they went out together  --  and as I sat there thinking of it all , I heard a sudden rushing sound in the street . I ran to the door , just in time to see a farm wagon , drawn by two strong horses , go pell-mell past my house , and overturn , as the frightened animals dashed around the corner . The neighborhood was agog in a moment , and I joined the rest in trying to help the occupants of the broken vehicle . We brought them into the house  --  the man and woman and a little child . As soon as they were in the light , I knew them ; they were some of my people  --  a German family , by the name of Abraham , who lived on a little farm just outside our suburb . They had been to me typical representatives of a stupid class , who have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shades . They were the kind that plant their pig-sty on the lake side of their house  --  put the pig-sty betwixt them and every other beauty , it seemed to me . What can life hold for such people ? They know nothing of love , or any other joy . Merely an animal existence is theirs . We fetched a doctor as speedily as possible  --  the parents were merely bruised , but the little child was badly hurt . At first we feared she was dying , and it was a relief to be told that she would probably live . I went out of the room to get some bandages , and the doctor followed me . Returning suddenly , I ran upon an unexpected scene ; up to that time , before us all , the parents had seemed perfectly stolid ; but just as I opened the door , the wife and mother rose from her knees by the bed , and I have seldom seen a look more expressive of tender love than that with which her husband took her in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; one of these , I am sure , will be , not to judge by the life upon the surface . There is a deep fount of feeling beneath , and often it is those whom we least suspect , who dip down into it . I was still busy with these people , when Randolph Chance walked in upon me . His kind heart needed no prompting to join in our little attentions , and he was of especial use in getting a vehicle to take the family home . After they had gone , and we found ourselves alone , a great embarrassment seemed to seize him in a fatal grasp . By and by I realized that I was really getting incensed , and I was afraid I should soon be in the position of the man who went to another , whom he had ill-treated , to apologize for his bad conduct , and , " By Jove , sir "  --  to use his own phrase , " I hit him again . " I tried to keep my letter before my eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant  --  conscience  --  to write another . And I should , if I did n't hold on to myself , and this man did n't behave differently . To avoid a clash , I set to work to clear away some of the confusion consequent upon the accident , and he helped me in this . One would suppose that might serve to cool him , and it did indeed , to such an extent that , upon our settling down again , he began the most commonplace conversation , giving me some incidents of his trip ; discussing the scenery ; weather ; population , and general aspects of Buffalo ; with much more of the dryest , most disagreeable stuff , that a man ever had the temerity to use , as a means of wasting a woman 's evening . To employ a childish phrase  --  it best fits the occasion  --  I grew madder and madder , until at last matters within me rose to such a height , that when he began to tell of his brother 's house in Buffalo , and to dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to hurl all of mine at him . The number of things I thought of that evening would form a library of energetic literature . Among other resolves , I determined from that day on , if I lived till my hair whitened  --  lived till I raised my third or fourth crop of teeth , never , never , to give Randolph Chance another thought . There was one comfort : he did not know , nor did any one else , what a complete goose I had made of myself ; but , though I had been most foolish , thanks to a sober , Puritanic ancestry , I still had myself in hand ; my hysterics had been occasional and secluded , and I was not wholly gone daft . I could recover ; I would ! and then , if ever he came to my feet , he would learn that some things do n't rise , after once they are cold . I was calm enough when he at last decided to go , and instead of running on excitedly , as I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really conversed . Indeed , to speak modestly , I think I was rather interesting . I had forgotten what he had called for . So had he  --  apparently . All I hoped was that he did not intend to bore me with frequent repetitions of this call . I had better use for my evenings than such waste of time as chatting with him . I cast about me for some suitable excuse to shut off future inflictions , and at last hit upon one that I thought might answer . " I suppose I must sacrifice myself for a while , " I said cheerfully ; " I have had a deal of business swoop down upon me , and in order to dispatch it , must shut myself up for a time , and forego the joys of society . " Instantly his old embarrassment came back upon him , as a small boy 's enemy  --  supposed to be vanquished  --  darts around the corner , and renews the attack . He started to go ; came back ; returned to the door ; again came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as I looked at him my anger , my coldness  --  all vanished , and I exclaimed : " Randolph Chance , why do n't you say it ! " " Some things are awfully hard to say . I can write  --   --  Oh Constance ! you might have mercy on me ! " " Well , " I said , laughing  --  I could almost see the light upon my face  --  " I suppose you want me to marry you . " " You ca n't get away now ! " he cried , a second later . The walls heard a much-smothered voice  --  " I do n't want to . " Now this little scene , I suppose , is what makes Randolph always say I proposed to him . This remark , oft repeated , sometimes under very trying circumstances , is his one disagreeableness . But I let it pass without comment , for I realize it is the spout to the kettle , and I am thankful that the steam has so safe and harmless an outlet . If I were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dim the fire ; but I am very cautious , and love still burns with a clear , bright flame . THE END .
