txt With the help of David B. Hill , Gov . Flower managed to do more work yesterday afternoon between the hours of 3 and 7 than during any entire day since the adjournment of the regular session of the Legislature ten days ago . Not to mention the Tammany Inspectors bill ; which Hill was anxious should be signed without further delay , in order to appease the Tammany leaders , who were becoming a little uneasy , the Governor made laws of the Excise bill and its supplements , the Constitutional . Convention bill , the Freedom of Worship bill , and the Senator 's pet measure reapportioning the Senate and Assembly districts . The Governor had no intention of buckling down to so much hard work all in one afternoon , but the keeper of his conscience told him that he must sign these bills  --  most of which would redound to the " party 's , " that is , Hill 's , benefit  --  without further procrastination , so like a dutiful schoolboy he dipped his pen in the ink and wrote " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master , who stood over him during the process . It will be remembered that Trill came up here three weeks ago to insist upon the passage of these bills by the Legislature , and that three of them were rushed through the Assembly in a single day by his orders . He could not trust his young lieutenants , Sheehan and Cantor , to do the work here , and came on from Washington to brace them up , just as he appeared here Friday night to see that his Governor carried out his directions . Mr. Hill fondly behaves that by the enactment of these laws he is keeping the promises made to the people of the State in the last half dozen Democratic platforms , but unfortunately the people know better , and 11 wo n't do him a bit of good to " point with pride " to the State statutes of 1892 . The slip-shod fashion in which the public business is being conducted in the Executive Chamber needs no better exemplifloatIon than the Governor 's action regarding the Excise bill . When the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill up to Friday last . A number were submitted , but it is safe to say that not one of them was even opened ; the time was certainly too short for any careful study of them . Hill discovered sometiling which Flower never would have found out , and for which no provision had been made , that the first Monday in May was the day fixed by law for the meeting of Excise Boards throughout the State and the granting of licenses , and that unless the bill was signed at once its provisions would not go into effect so far as the greater part of the State was concerned until the first Monday in May , 1893 . This startled Hill out of his usual serenity and he hauled the Governor over red-hot coals for having permitted the fact to escape his attention , for did not it mean that he ( Hill ) would loose his prestige with his friends , the liquor dealers , in whose interests this bill was prepared 1 As it is , the Boards of Excise in the country towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow , and will grant licenses under the old law , so that in Many portions of the State the law will not ge into full effect until next year . According to the terms of the bill , the existing Commissioners of Excise , except in Richmond County , are continued in office for the terms for which they were chosen . They must meet on the first Monday In May , and in cities at such other times as thevmay deem necessary , and in towns at such other times not oftener than once a month as they may deem it to be necessary . Premises within 200 feet of a church or schoolhouse and not heretofore licensed shall not be hereafter licensed . By a supplementary act , signed later , druggists may have both storekeepers ' and druggists ' licenses . There are five classes of licenses ' under the bill . First , the hotel license , which requires ten bedrooms in cities and three in towns . The fee for this class is from $30 to $250 in cities and from $30 to $150 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which the sale of strong and spirituous liquors , wine , and beer is permitted upon the payment of the same fees as for a hotel license . The third is the saloon ale and beer license , permitting the sale of ale and beer only . The fees for this class are from $30 to $75 in cities and from $20 to $60 in towns . The fourth is the storekeepers ' license for the sale of strong and spirituous liquors , winee , ales , and beer , not to be drunk on the premises , upon the payment of the same fees as for hotel licenses . The fifth is the druggists ' license for the sale , upon a physician 's prescription only to be but once used , of strong and spirituous liqnors , wines , ale , and beer , not to be drunk on the premises , upon the payment of a fee of $20 . The Richmond County bill makes the Excise Board the Board of Police Commissioners and two citizens to be appointed by the Board of Supervisors , one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another bill signed yesterday was the collateral inheritance tax revision law , which goes into effect to-morrow , upon which the Statutory Revieion Commission has spent much time and which its members consider to be one of their best pieces of work . The percentages remain the same and the changes made simply have as their object the easier collection of the tax and the preventing of evasions of the law . The amount of the direct heir 's tax collected last year aggregated only $24,000 , according to Controller Campbell ; this year he thinks that the figure will reach at least $500,000 . In its present shape the law will be much more effective In every way , and will do what its advocates originally intended that it should , In speaking of the Tammany Inspeotors bill to-day , a prominent Democrat said : " Tammany 's chief object in reducing the number of Inspectors from four to three , two of whom shall be selected from the party casting the greatest number of votes in New-York at the last preceding State election  --  or , if there bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of votes  --  is to prevent any other Democratic organiatttion than itself which may be formed in the future from having represehtaLion on the Election Boards . It is one of the worst bills ever passed by any Legislature or signed by any Governor . Mr. Flower 's action of yesterday should destroy whatever grain of respect the people of the State still have left for him . "
