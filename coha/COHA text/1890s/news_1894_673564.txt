txt Miss Keyser trod on dangerous ground when she argued before the Constitutional Convention that women ought to be allowed to vote because , " with lower wages than men , there are more men dependent upon charity than women , and the aggregate savings of women in savings banks are greater than those of men . " Naturally enough . Men go to the almshouse because most of them have not only themselves to support , but a wife and children into the bargain , so that when old age comes on and the evil days and rheumatism , they have no accumulation in savings banks to draw upon for their daily bread or gruel ; while women , fortunate beings , eating at the husband 's table  --  all their lives and paying for their gowns from the husband 's purse , are enabled to put aside their independent earnings . Can we establish political equality between the sexes without establishing social and economic equality ? That is to say , if women acquire the privilege of voting , ought they not in fairness to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new duties now universally reckoned as male duties ? Of course , if women vote , they must go into the hurly-burly of politics and give and take like men . They must expect to be attacked and traduced , to have their lies nailed to the counter , and their shallowness and sophistication exposed precisely as the other sex has done for hundreds of years since it began to vote . From political equality to equality in other respects is not so long a step . Were it taken , Miss Keyser 's almshouse statistics would soon stand in need of radical revision . And this world , we fancy , would not be any happier than it is now . The dependent and protected condition has , after all , its compensations.
