txt Mr. Chandler was absent from the Senate Chamber at the time of the sensational speeches in relation to the Tariff bill and the President 's letter to Mr. Wilson , and lost an opportunity which only those who know his predilections can estimate at its true worth . Since his return he has been turning over in his , mind plans for directing attention anew to the questions brought out in this controversy , which he missed : He yesterday settled upon a resolution , which he introduced , calling for an investigation of the Dominion Coal Company of Nova Scotia . This resolution came up in the Senate today , and the New-Hampshire man made it the basis of a characteristic address , which was full of innuendo and sarcastic flings and painfully deficient in specific statements . Mr. Chandler professes to think he scents a grave danger to the country in the existence of a corporation formed when the Republicans were in power for the perfectly legitimate business of dealing in a commodity which the people of New-England would undoubtedly like to see made available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enterprise had in mind the revision of the tariff in 1894 is to acknowledge that they had a clearer insight into the political future than the New-Hampshire statesman possessed , and that is an admission a great many politicians would not care to make . Ever since his return to the city , Mr. Chandler has been rehearsing the main portion . of the speech he made to-day , and those who were favored with " hearings " find that he stuck closely to his announcements , and made the " hits " which he expected would prove so entertaining , but which , as a matter of fact , fell rather flat . Mr. Gray asked some awkward questions , and Mr. Hill also bobbed up unexpectedly with suggestions , and finally made a motion to table , which , although defated , had the effect of carrying the resolution to the calendar , from which it can only be taken by vote of the Senate . The fact that Mr. Gorman , Mr. Pugh , and other Democrats voted with Mr. Chandler is taken to mean that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely selfish position regarding the coal schedule . Mr. Chandler in the outset gave a statement of the circumstances which he thought justified him in offering the resolution . He quoted from the prospectus of the company , issued in Boston in February , 1893 , showing that the capital consisted of $1,500,000 in bonds , 51,500,000 in preferred stock , and $15,00'J,030 in common stock , and that the bonds and preferred stock were reserved in the treasury of the company for its fiscal needs . He had been informed , and had no doubt of the fact , that the options on the mining property had been bargained for in 1892 , previously to the Presidential election , and that the final arrangements were not concluded until after the Presidential election . He gave from the prospectus the names of the officers , including Henry Whitney of Boston , and mentioned as a member of the syndicate Frank Jones of New-Hampshire , " well known in politics . " Nearly all the common stock , Mr. Chandler said , was " watered stock . " The peculiarity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution , was that it was evidently a scheme that was to go forward in the case of legislation of a certain character by Congress . The whole gravamen of the prospectus was that , by reason of the success of tariff reform in the United States , or of the success of some other idea , or of the election to office of some President or of some Congress , the duty on coal of 75 cents a ton was to be removed , so that the Dominion Coal Company could make money . Mr. Chandler also referred to the prospectus of another Nova Scotia coal company , the Broad Cove Company , based , he said , on the same theory that success was to be given to that commercial venture by the removal of the duty on coal . He thought that , from the facts stated by him , the Dominion Coal Company ought to be investigated . If Congress had before it a revenue bill , and if a twenty-million company was organized , with its prosperity depending upon the removal of a duty through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Congress could afford to watch . The Senate could afford to look and see what was being done by those companies which were ready to hand out their securities by millions in order to influence the action of Congress in removing the duty on coal . Mr. Chandler , in the course of his remarks , spoke of John E. Russell of Massachusetts as being connected with the Dominion Coal Company , and said that a few days ago a New-York newspaper stated that Mr. Russell had come to Washington to give counsel and advice to President Cleveland ; that the President of the United States had written a letter , without addressing it to anybody in particular , and had dated it July 2 , keeping it as a sort of stock in trade of dynamite ; that he had written it and kept it on hand ready to be launched at some convenient opportunity , and that , ten days afterward , the President found himself in company with John E. Russell , Don M. Dickinson , and some other kitchen cabinet advisers ; that that letter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should not be made public ; and that it was then decided ( so the story went ) that the letter should be addressed to the Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means . ' The letter had met the approval of that conclave that was gathered around the President , and had been sent to Mr. Wilson , and had , in due course of time , seen light of day , to the consternation of the House and the great surprise of every Senator ? particularly *of the two Senators from ' MaryI land and Tennessee , ( Gorman and Harris . ) He understood that " this Mr. John E. Russell , " a representative of the Dominion Coal Company , had been loud in that conference , loud about the hotels , loud on the railroad cars , in his declarations that the President of the United States would plant himself impregnably on the doctrines of the Democratic Party , and would insist on free coal . He respectfully submitted that the facts which he had stated not only justified but required such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with Mr. Chandler , and promptly killed his resolution , nobody taking the trouble to reply to his speech .
