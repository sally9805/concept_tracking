txt The 1.700 employes of Henry Disston Sc Sons , saw and file manufacturers , were made happy today by the official announcement that their wages would be advanced 10 per cent. , the advance to become effective at once , as the firm 's week begins on Wednesday . The increase is a restoration of the wages which prevailed prior to the panic of 1893 , as the subsequent depression in general trade made it necessary , it was claimed , to reduce wages . The cut was the same as to-day 's advance-10 per cent . Early in March last a local paper published an interview with Hamilton Disston , a member of the firm , in which he said , among other things , that by the end of March he could probably judge from the condition of his firm 's business whether the general recovery in trade was temporary or permanent . When he was reminded of his statement about April 1 , he admitted that so far as he could determine , the improvement had come to stay , but that recovery from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gradual . Mr. Disston has found no cause since then to change his prediction , for in April the firm 's business increased , as Compared with the same month last year , 12 per cent. , and the increase for the present month , he esti- ? mates , will be from 15 to 20 per cent , The first two months of the year showed a slight improvement over the same period in 1894 , but in March the volume of business was about the same as in March of last year . The point is made that the improvement in a business such as is conducted by Henry Disston &; Sons is a more valuable indication of the general situation than improvement in almost any other line , as the articles they manufacture are used in nearly every branch of trade , and an increase in the demand for them is a certain reflection of general improvement . To-day 's advance in wages was unsolicited , and was a complete surprise to the employes , although , as one of them expressed it , " We knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm felt sure better times had come to stay .
