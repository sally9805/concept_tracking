txt The committee appointed by Mayor GILROY to make arrangements for Manhattan Day at the World 's Fair and to prepare a programme of ceremonies meets at the City Hall at noon to-day . The Mayor has already received assurances of co-operation from a large number of the gentlemen appointed . The suggestion of a special day for New-York City at the fair has awakened an unexpected interest . The exposition is nearing its close , but it is evident that the people of this city have n't all seen it , or have n't seen enough of it . The formal ceremonies of the day , we should say , ought to be , above all , brief , since the New-York visitors on the grounds will care more for sightseeing than for ceremony . One quickly tires of speeches and orations and appointed observances . Of the big and splendid show in Jackson Park one never gets tired , save as physical fatigue may compel intervals of repose . The boldness with which the architects and sculptors and artists went about their work , unstinted in-money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast spaces at their command , has resulted in the creation of a magic city that edifies the beholder more than a " meeting " with a Chairman and a printed programme could do . The stay of the Manhattan Day visitors will of necessity he short . They will use it most wisely in-seeing the-fair . Still there must be a-meeting and a ceremony , and at the New-York Building , of course , - with a few speeches , religions observances , and possibly some other features appropriate to the day and purpose . All this need not employ more than two honra , of the New-York visitors ' time . The railroads have done much to make the trip to the fair easy , expeditious , and cheap . For Manhattan Day we trust they will be persuaded to make further and special concession .
