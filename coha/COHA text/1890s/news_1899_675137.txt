txt The completeness with which the charges brought against the War Department , and more specifically against the commissariat , have been proved is only equaled by the completeness with which charges that were never brought have been disproved . These latter charges have been " hurled back " into the teeth of some person or persons unknown with all the accompaniments which even the cultured EAGAN could have demanded . For instance , there was the charge that the " canned roast beef " was " embalmed , " or treated with preservative fluid , presumably boracic or salicylic acid . Prof. CRITTENDEN deals with that charge as an expert , as , indeed , he ought to be , having been retained by some borax companies to go to Albany to argue and prove that there was no harm in borax . When he testifies that there was no borax at all in the canned beef he covers with confusion the villain . if any such villain there be , who ever said there was . There is no such villain , but that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he existed , with one hand tied behind him , tied behind the professor , that is to say , and not the non-existent slanderer . On the other hand , there would be as little difficulty in proving that the refrigerated beef , which was furnished in quarters , had not had the nutritious juice all boiled out of it , and was not composed of " scraps and tailings , " as some scoundrel never said It was . Why the Court of Inquiry should per- mit all this solemn foolery does not appear . What does appear is , that , admitting evidence to disprove charges that have not been brought is " a waste of time , " as Major WEBB said about eating the canned beef , the receipt of which was diligently winked at by commissaries act- : ing , as they have testified , under rush orders , issued , as EAGAN has testified , or as has been testified of him , " under pressure . " Two very likely lines of inquiry have been opened , however , by the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the gentle EAGAN should have sworn that the stipulation in the contract about keeping refrigerated beef twenty-four hours , instead of seventytwo , should turn out to have been inserted in his own handwriting , and , the other , how the clerk , to whose " clerical error " the gentle EAGAN attributed that clause , was induced to withdraw the resignation which he has testified that he offered upon reading his chief 's astounding testimony . To pursue these inquiries and to debate the commercial basis of the whole business would by no means be a waste of time . Not by any means that the indications stop at , EAGAN . They go beyond EAGAN , to the chief whom the incompetency of his subordinates did not at all discompose , but who took a violent animosity to the officer who , as in duty bound , exposed their incompetency . It is the duty of every American whom the President will believe to tell the President frankly and freely that this business goes far beyond even the starving or poisoning of some thousands of American soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were dealt with frankly and fearlessly the mischief of it would at that point cease . But the fact is that our " General Staff , " with the ridiculous ALGER at its head , fs as much discredited before the country and the world as the French General Staff , with the transient and fugitive Algers who have been for years in turn running away from their responsibilities as Ministers of War in connection with the continuance of injustice and the denial of justice in the Dreyfus case . The President ought to know that the retention of ALGER in the War Department is the thing that , more than all other things together , brings discredit upon the professions which the Administration makes of efficient and honest government in the Antilles or in the Philippines . Americans know this already and Cubans and Puerto Ricans and Filipinos are in the way to find it out . The incompatibility of Aigerism and expansion is the " modern instance " of DURICE 'S " wise saw " that " a great empire and little minds go ill together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
