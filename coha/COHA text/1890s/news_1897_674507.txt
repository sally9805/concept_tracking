txt A warm discussion arose at the meeting of the Medical Society of the County of New York at the Academy of Medicine last night as to the fate of a certain bill which had been advocated by the society and passed by the Assembly and Senate , but which apparently had been lost in the multitude of measures still left over for the consideration of the Governor . The bill provided for the stricter regulation of medical charity , through the investigation of all applicants for treatment by free dispensaries . It also provided that the State Board of Charities should have the power to take away the charters of such institutions as violated the proposed law . The measure , after getting smoothly through the Legislature , and both of the medical societies having , as they said last night , " assurances that the Governor would sign it , " suddenly disappeared amid many other unsigned measures in the executive office . The bill had to be approved last night before the stroke of 12 , or it would be lost , and this added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burtenshaw , who read a report from the Committee on Abuses of Medical Charity , said that the bill had been lost because the Governor had not had time to consider it . Dr. D. B. St. John Roosa replied that he knew the Governor had not approved the bill because he had considered it and was opposed to it . In the heated discussion that followed it was brought out that Dr. Roosa , who is a Member of the society and who is also connected with several free dispensaries , had gone on to Albany and opposed the bill before Gov . Black . Doctors Expected a .. Lively Time . The hall was filled with physicians , who evidently expected a lively meeting . The Committee on Legislation reported on its work . It set forth that , emboldened by the success of the chiropodists in getting legislative recognition , other non-medical bodies were trying to secure full license to treat diseases of the eye , &c.; Their bills , however , had been defeated . Dr. James Hawley Burton Shaw , Chairman of the Committee on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee to secure the passage of a law to check the abuses of free dispensaries . The committee had written to ninety-five dispensaries , to ask if their Governing Boards approved the movement to regulate the abuse of medical charity , and would co-operate with the committee . Of seventy-six that replied , nineteen ignored the question . Five of these were homeopathic , two were under the supervision of the Department of Charities , and the rest were church institutions . To indicate the number of cases treated by the free dispensaries , the - report - stated that St. Mary's- Hospital had treated last year 7,100 patients , and the out-patient department of the New York Hospital had treated 9,800 , while 45,838 new patients had made visits to the dispensaries . A bill to regulate this abuse , the report stated , had been passed by the Legislature , and had not been signed by the Governor on account of great pressure of business . A motion was made to receive the report , but Dr. Roosa arose and said that he wished to saw a few words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those at the door came in and awaited developments . Dr. Roosa Buys Abuse Is Mostly Talk . " This talk about the abuse of medical charity , " began Dr. Roosa , " has been very much exaggerated . It has been largely confined to the medical press . Those journals are always sneering and scoffing at the attending physicians and surgeons in institutions that have , by their fame , brought thousands of medical men to New York and made this city the centre of the medical science of the country . Applause-3 " Thy assume that gentlemen in these institutions are so anxious to demonstrate their skill that they are continually receiving for gratuitous treatment patients who ought to pay the doctors . I am connected with two large institutions , and I want to say that both of them try to avoid this abuse . We have taken care of the sick poor , and we hope to achieve for ourselves an honorable reputation for doing that which it is an honor to do . " Applause . Here Dr. Egbert H. Grandin made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landon Carter Gray , President of the society , who was in the chair , sustained the point , but said that Dr. Roosa would be heard gladly after the question was put . He did not wish to suppress freedom of speech . After the report was adopted Dr. Roosa continued . He said : The Governor Opposed the Rill . " The Governor has not signed that bill because he has not had time to consider it , but because he has considered it . Applause . If any dispensary is improperly using the important privileges , its charter ought to be annulled ; but it ought to be annulled in the proper way . I would not submit without a struggle to having the charter of my institution taken away by a body of less dignity than that which conferred it . It would have to be annulled by the courts . " Dr. Egbert H. Grandin replied to Dr. Roosa . He said : " These institutions help to defraud the medical profession . Applause . We have spent years in writing editorials , we have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of charity the Bible speaks of , and that is why , Dr. Roosa , we have turned as the worm and gone to the Legislature . We have determined to use free speech and stigmatize this kind of charity . " This bill has failed because of influence exerted by the rich and powerful managers of these free dispensaries . Within the last two months I have known of three persons who were able to pay me for my services , who have gone to these free hospitals , and paid 815 a week for their board and got their treatment for nothing . Robbed of His Fee . " I am robbed , and the man who goes to the dispensary makes a fool of himself . The time will come when this society will strike the evil at its root . " We are not fighting Dr. Roosa . We recognize that his institution does good , but it will take more than him to convince me that indiscriminate charity will do good . " Applause . Dr. Frederick Sturgis suggested that physicians send their patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion was warmly applauded . Another physician suggested that the offending dispensaries be disciplined . " I do n't proposed to be robbed , " he shouted , " if I can help it . " Applause . Dr. Roost ! , said : " I think that I have been treated a little discourteously . The institutions to which I belong are governed by physicians . I have made no more money out of my institution than any of these despairing gentlemen . Derisive laughter . I could tell of many patients who have come to us because they were maltreated by general and gentle practitioners . " Cries of " oh ! oh ! " Dr. Rowe , soon after finishing his last speech quietly left the hall . Dr. Joseph E. Janvrin , President of the County Medical Association , who had gone to Albany with Dr. Hadden to urge the Govprnor to sign the bill , was asked for a report . He said that at first he had assurances that the Governor would approve it , but toward the last he found that some influence had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animus toward the State of Charities . ?
