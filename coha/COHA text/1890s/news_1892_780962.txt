txt The primaries of the Republican Parry in Kings County on Thursday are generally conceded to have given a fair majority to Naval Officer WiLus , which that energetio gentleman claims is a triumph for the Administration . If the issue in the primaries were really what the most emphatic friends of Mr. HARRISON insist that it was , the result was not so flattering as the President might well wish . It was in reality a very hard and close fight , and the opposition to Mr. WILLts was such as Mr. HAnallsoN can not regard with any satisfaction . To pull through with just a fair working majority of the delegates in a fight where there was no other candidate for the Presidential nomination named , and where the choice was between Mr. HARRISON and any one else that could be found , is not an evidence of great party strength . This is the way the matter must be interpreted , if we are to take the view of Mr. HARRISON 'S avowed champion . It is strengthened , moreover , by the fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRACY , the Secretary of the Navy , and a favorite son of Brooklyn , and Mr. ELKINS , the Secretary of War , and the " next friend " of Mr. HARRISON , were openly on Mr. WiLus 's side , and did all that they could do to advance his cause . In reality the issue was not quite so simple . The fight may fairly be defined as one against Tom PLATT and Plattism in Kings County , and though it is pretty clear that Mr. HARRISON is suspicious and afraid of PLATT , and would gladly see his power in New-York politics reduced , PLATT 's men in Kings County claim not to be opposed to Mr. HARRISON 'S renomination , and their leader , ERNST NATHAN , holds Mr. HARRISON 'S commission as Collector of Internal Revenue . The revolt against PLikrr and NATHAN was not therefore wholly or openly a revolt against HARRISON , and though 1 Mr. WILLIE is undoubtedly perfectly sincere in his loyalty to Mr. HARRISON , he may well be thought to have used the Harrison cry to aid his purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely worthy . Nothing could be much meaner , more debased , or more hostile to the best interests of a party of self-respecting voters than the Platt-Nathan rule . It was the rule of corruption , intrigue , and intimidation , and its strongest foundation was spoils . Beyond a doubt it has injured the Republican Party in Rings County , as it has in the whole State . and it had to be got rid of if the party hoped to exert anything like its full strength in the important elections of this Autumn . But then it can not be forgotten , and ought not to be , that the spoils which were the foundation of this rule were furnished by Mr. Iannisozz himself . They are a part of that fund of public patronage that was placed by Mr. HARRISON in the heads of Mr. PLATT to be distributed largely for Mr. HARRISON 'S own benefit . The way iu which it has been used is shameful , no doubt : but the way in which it was given to be used was also shameful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRISON plead in mitigation of his offense that he knew no better , that ho was simply carrying out the political methods in which he was trained , having no notion that they were not as good as any . That excuse might do for his coarser tools , like NATHAN , or even for Mr. PLATT , who seems congenitally incapable of understanding the right in politics , as lie certainly is of living up to it . PLATT , moreover , has openly defended the spoils system , not as a necessary evil , but as no evil at all , as a good system by which deserving mon got their deserts and wretched Pharisees - who believe in honesty - were brought to grief and humiliation . But Mr. HARRISON has , on the contrary , denounced the system from an early date , has exposed its baseness and corruption , has bemoaned his share in it , has prayed to be delivered from it . All this he did while yet only a Senator from Indiana . Later , as candidate for President , he not only condemned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in promising to uphold the reform of the civil service , and pledged his word that , if he were elected , the " good of the service " alone should determine any removals , With these promises warm on his lips , he turned the patronage of the Federal Government in the State of New-York over to the most notorious , unscrupulous , and shameless spoils monger in the land . A man who , in violation of his own pledges , will take what he has acknowledged does not belong to him , and hand it to a professional dealer in such stolen goods to be used for his advantage , may be sincerely sorry when he sees himself cheated . But he is not an ideal leader of a reform movement .                     @x txt The Secretary of the Treasury , the Hon. Charles Foster , visited Columbus to-day and had a long conference with Gov . McKinley , ex-Attorney General Watson , and other friends of the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the talk that followed touching the published Interview , iu which Mr. Poe had gone out of his way to say that Mr. Foster had come to Ohio for the sole and avowed purpose of setting up a delegation in Ohio for Harrison . Mr. Poo entered a denial and stated that he had but five minutes ' conversation with the correspondent . To those on the outside the impression urevails that the State Auditor was correctly reported , as Poe is a candidate for delegate at large and an anti-Harrison man . Mr. Foster suggested to Mr. Poe that he was quite as much interested in Ohio as most of its citizens ; that he owned and was interested In very many industries ; that his home was where he was born , and , further , that he retained and maintained his right to visit his home at all times and under all circumstances , even though he was identified with the Administration . It is manifest that the State Auditor has put his foot in it , and has compromised his own faction because of his indiscreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man unsafe to run for delegate at large . There is an unmistakable effort behig made to bring Gov . McKinley into the field as a dark horse , but every effort in that direction has been discouraged by the Governor , who wishes it distinctly understood that he is not a candidate in any sense . but is pledged to the support of President Harrison . This afternoon Secretary Foster left for his home In Fostoria and Gov . McKinley for his home at Canton .
