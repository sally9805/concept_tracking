txt The Tribune continues to be disturbed by the paragraph in the Wilson bill that removes the duties on copper ore and copper ingots , and would have everybody believe that it is distressed by the contemplation of an impending " flood " of copper from Chile and elsewhere . But there could not be a less favorable time for putting such stuff on the political market , as the trade report of the Tribune shows . We quote the following from its market report of Saturday last : " The feature of the metal market is the strength of copper and the recent heavy export of that material . Dealers disagree as to the cause for the unusually heavy outflow , some people saying that it is to be used for war purposes , and others holding that it is absorbed by a European syndicate . Speaking of the matter , one of the firm of Park Brothers &; Co. says : The unprecedented export of 50,000 tons of copper within the last four months is very significant . It can not be ascribed to the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where that vast quantity of copper has been stored . But for an accident , the last copper ring would have been an unqualified success . ' " While it is true that the exports of the last four months , as we showed two or three days ago , have been unusually large . it is also true that for some years we have . been exporting nearly one-third of the American output , which is now one-half of the entire copper output of the world . And in spite of these exports , the value of which has for the last rive years averaged about $10,000,000 per annum , the accumulation of surplus here has become so great that the producers have been able in the last four months to ship to Europe 50,000 tons , as the Tribune says , or onesixth of the world 's product of the metal for one year . And now a journal which commended the removal three years ago , by the act , of four-fifths of the old duty on copper ore and nearly threequarters of the old duty on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight duty still remaining will cause copper to be imported .
