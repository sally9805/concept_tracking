txt HE most striking part of the great Social Revolution which was witnessed by the earlier years of our century was undoubtedly the event which preceded that Revolution , made it possible , and moulded it ; namely , the Conquest of the Professions by the people . Happily it was a Conquest achieved without exciting any active opposition ; it advanced unnoticed , step by step , and it was unsuspected , as regards its real significance , until the end was inevitable and visible to all . It is my purpose in this Chapter , first to show what was the position of the mass of the nation before this event , as regards the Professions ; and next to relate briefly the successive events which led to the Conquest , and so prepared the way for the abolition of all that was then left of the old aristocratic regime . Speaking in general terms - the exceptions shall be noted afterward - the Professions during the whole of the nineteenth century were jealously barred and closed in and fenced round . Admission , in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth and good breeding . Not that there was any expressed rule to that effect . It was not written over the gateway of Lincoln 's Inn that none but gentlemen were to be admitted , nor was it ever stated in any book or paper that none but gentlemen were to be admitted . But , as you will be shown immediately , the barring of the gate against the lad of humble origin was quite as effectually accomplished without any law , rule , or regulation whatever . The professional avenues of distinction which , early in the century , were only three or four in number , had , by the end of the century , been multiplied tenfold by the birth or creation of new Professions . Formerly a young man VOL . XIII. - 57 of ambition might go into the Church , into one of the two services , into the Law , or into Medicine . He might also , if he were a country gentleman , go into the House of Commons . At the end of the century the professional career included , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the forms of Art , all the divisions of Literature , Music , Architecture , the Drama , Engineering , Teaching , Archieology , Political Economy , and , in fact , every conceivable subject to which the mind of man can worthiJy devote itself . In all these branches there were great - in some , very great-prizes to be obtained ; prizes not always of money , but of honor : in some of them the prizes included what was then considered the greatest of all rewards  --  a Peerage . The country , indeed , was already beginning to insist that the national distinctions should be bestowed upon all thoseand only upon those - who rendered real services to the State . One poet had been made a Peer . One man of science had been made a Privy Councillor , and another a Peer : two painters had been made baronets ; and the humble distinction of Knight Bachelor , which had been tossed contemptuously to city sheriffs , provincial mayors , and undistinguished persons who used back-stairs influence to get the title , was now brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engineers , physicians , and others . Nothing could more clearly show the real contempt in which literature and science were held in an aristocratic country than that , although there were a dozen degrees of peerage and half a dozen orders of knighthood , there was not one order reserved for men of science , literature , and art . Feeble protests from time to time were made against this absurdity , but in the end it proved useful , because the chief argument against the continuance of titles of honor in the great debate on the subject , // in the year 1920 , was the fact that all through the nineteenth century the men who most deserved the thanks and recognition of the State were ( with the exception of soldiers and lawyers ) absolutely neglected by the Court and the House of Lords . Let us consider by what usages , rather than by what rules , the Professions were barred . In the Church a young man could not be ordained under the age of twenty-three . Nor would the Bishop ordain him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cambridge . This meant that he was to stay at school , and that a good school , till the age of nineteen ; that he was then to devote four years more to carrying on his studies in a very expensive manner ; in other words , that he must be able to spend at least a thousand pounds before he could obtain orders , and that he would then receive pay , *at a much lower rate than a good carpenter or en*inedriver . At the Bar it was the custom for a man to enter his name after leaving the University : he would then be called at five or six-and-twenty . A young man must be able to keep himself until that age , and even longer , because a lawyer 's practice begins slowly . There were also very heavy dues on entrance and on being called . In plain terms , no young man could enter at the Bar who did not possess or command , at least , a thousand pounds . In the lower branch of the law a young man might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had to pay a heavy premium for his articles , and large fees both at entrance , and on passing the examination which admitted him . Not much less , therefore , including his maintenance , than a thousand pounds would be required of him before he began to make anything for himself . A medical man , even one who only desired to become a humble general practitioner , had to work through a five years ' course , with hospital fees . Like the solicitor , he might qualify for about a thousand pounds . In all the new professions , chemistry , physics , biology , zoiAogy , geology , botany , and the other branches of science , engineering , mining , surveying , assaying , architecture , actuary work-everything-a long apprenticeship was needed with special studies in costly colleges . In Teaching , he who aspired to the more distinguished branches had no chance at all , unless he was a graduate in the highest honors of Oxford and Cambridge . In the Arts - painting , sculpture , music - long practice , devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service was divided into two branches , both open to competitive examination . The higher branch attracted first class men of Oxford and Cambridge ; the lower , clever and welltaught men from the Middle Class Schools . But the latter could not pass into the former . In the Army , the only branch in which a man could live upon his pay was the scientific branch , open to anybody who could compete at a very stiff examination after a long and very expensive course of study , and could pay ? 200 a year for two or three years after entrance . In the other branches of the services , a young lieutenant could not live upon his pay . In the Navy the examinations were frequent and severe , while the pay was very small . The barrier , therefore , which kept the Professions in the hands of the upper classes was a simple toll-gate . At the toll stood a man . " Come , " he said , holding out an inexorable palm . " With an education which has cost you already a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Then you shall be admitted among the ranks of those for whom are reserved the highest prizes of the State ; viz. , Authority , Honor , and Wealth . " It is apparent , then , that no one could enter the Professions who had no money . No need to write up " None but the sons of gentlemen may apply . " Very many sons of gentlemen , in fact , had to turn away sorrowfully after gazing with wistful eyes upon that ladder which they knew that they , too , could climb , as well as a Denman or an Erskine . As for the sons of poor parents , they could not so much as think of the ladder : they hardly knew that it existed : they cared nothing // about it . As well sigh for the Lord Mayor 's gilt carriage and four , or the Field Marshal 's baton . No poor lad could aspire to the Professions at all . In other words , out of a population of thirtyseven millions , or eight millions of families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man belonging to the half million families-perhaps less-who could expend upon their son 's education a thousand pounds apiece . Nor for a long time was the exclusion felt or even recognized . He who wished to rise out of the working class either became a small master of his own trade , or else he opened a small shop of some kind . But he did not aspire to become a physician or a barrister or a clergyman . And it never occurred to him that such a career could be open to him . But if , as happened every day , such a man had got on in the world and was ambitious for his son , he made him a doctor or a solicitor , these being the two Professions which cost least - or perhaps he made him a mechanical engineer , though it might cost a good deal more . Perhaps if the boy was clever , he managed to send him to the University with the intention of getting him ordained . Such was the first upward step in gentility-first , to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a profession rather than a trade . Always , however , one had to settle with the man at the toll . He was inexorable . " Pay down , " he said , " a thousand pounds , if you would be admitted within this bar . " The young man , therefore , whose father worked for wages , or for a small salary , or in a small way of trade , could not so much as dream of entering any of the Professions . They were as much closed to him as the gates of Paradise . But during the nineteenth century a new Profession was created , and this was open to him . This they could not close . It had already grown great and strong before they thought of closing it . It was open to the poor man 's son . He went into it . And with the help of it , as with a key , he opened all the rest . You shall understand immediately what this was . I have spoken of certain exceptions to this exclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and the Universities scholarships , founded for the purpose of enabling poor lads to carry on their studies . The schools had long ceased to be the property of the poor for whom they were designed : their scholarships , mostly of recent foundation , were granted by competitive examination to those boys who had already spent a large sum of money on preliminary work . The scholarships of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge were also given by examination , without the least consideration of the candidates ' private resources . There was , however , a chance that a poor lad might get one of these . If he did , everything was open to him . The annals of the Universities contain numberless instances in which lads from the lower middle class made their way , and a few instances  --  a very few-here one and there one -- in wb*h the sons of working-men thus forced themselves upward . We must remember these scholarships when we speak of the harrier , but we must not attach too much importance to them . One may also recall many instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated , and sent to the University by a rich or noble patron . In the Army , again , many men rose from the ranks and obtained commissions . In the Navy , this was always impossible , with one or two brilliant exceptions-as the case of Captain Cook . It may be said that there are many cases on record in which men of quite humble origin have advanced themselves in trade , even to becoming Lord Mayor of London . Could not a poor lad do in the nineteenth century what Whittington did in the fourteenth ? Could he not tie up his belongings in a handkerchief and make for London , where the streets were paved with gold , and the walls were built of jasper ? Well , you see , in this matter of the poor lad and his elevation to giddy heights there has been a little mistake , principally due to the chap-books . The poor lad who worked his way upward in the nineteenth century belonged to the bourgeoisie , not the craftsman class . While his schoolfellows remained clerks , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by cousinship , was enabled to get his foot on the ladder , up which he proceeded to climb with strength and resolution . The poor lad who got on in earlier times was the son of a country gentleman . Dick Whittington was the son of Sir William Whittington , Knight and afterwards outlaw . He was apprenticed to his cousin Sir John Fitzwarren , Mercer and merchant-adventurer , son of Sir William Fitzwarren , Knight . Again , Chichele , Lord Mayor , and his younger brother , Sheriff , and his elder brother Archbishop of Canterbury , were sons of one Chichele , Gentleman and Armiger of Higham Ferrers in the county of Northampton . Sir Thomas Gresham was the son of Sir Richard Gresham , nephew of Sir John Gresham , and younger brother of Sir John Gresham also of a good old country family . In fact , we may look in vain through the annals of London city for the rise of the humble boy from the ranks of the craftsmen . Once or twice , perhaps , one may find such a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , when the long wars attracted to the army all the younger sons , it does seem as if the Mayors and Aldermen must have come from very humble beginnings . Even then , however , we find on investigation that the city fathers of that time had mostly sprung from small shops . They were never , to begin with , craftsmen , and at the end of the century any such rise was never dreamed of by the most ambitious . The clerk , if a lad became a clerk , remained a clerk : he had no hope of becoming anything else . The shopman remained a shopman , his only hope being the establishment of himself as a master if he could save enough money . The craftsman remained a craftsman . And for partnerships there were always plentyyounger sons and others-eager to buy themselves in , or there were sons and nephews waiting their turn . No son of a working man , or a clerk , could hope for any other advancement in the City than advancement to higher salary for long and faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : To him who could afford to earn nothing till he was two-and-twenty , and little till he was five-and-twenty , and could find the money for fees , lectures , and courses and coaches , everything that the country had to offer was open . With this limitation there was never any country in which prizes were more open than Great Britain and Ireland . A clever lad might enter the Royal Engineers or Artillery with a tolerable certainty of being a Colonel and a K.C.B. at fifty ; or he might go into the Church , where if he had ability and had cultivated eloquence and possessed good manners he might count on a Bishopric ; or he might go to the Bar , where , if he was lucky , he might become a judge or even Lord Chancellor . Unless however he could provide the capital wanted for admission , he could attain to nothing-nothing-nothing . What became , then , of the clever lad ? In some cases he became a clerk , crowding into a trade already overcrowded . He trampled on his competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clerks , had no ambition and no perception of the things wanted . This young fellow had . He taught himself the things that were wanted : he generally took therefore the best place . But he had to remain a clerk . Or , more often , he became a teacher in a Board School . In this capacity he obtained a certain amount of social consideration , a certain amount of independence , and an income varying from ? 150 to ? 400 a year . Or , which also happened frequently , he might become a dissenting minister of the humbler kind . In that case he had every chance of passing through life in a little chapel at a small town , a slave to his own , and to his congregation 's , narrow prejudices . Or , he might go abroad , to one of the Colonies . Earlier in the century , between the years 1850 and 1880 many poor lads had gone to Australia or New Zealand and had done well for themselves , a few had become millionaires ; but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein a young man could advance himself , seemed played out . Workingmen they wanted , but not clever and penniless young fellows . He might , it has been suggested , go // into the House . There were already one or two workingmen in the House . But they were sent there especially to represent certain interests by workingmen ; not because their representative was an ambitious and clever young man . And the workingman 's member , so far , had advanced a very little way as a political success . It was not in Politics that a young man would find his opening . This brings us to the one career open to him-he might become a Journalist . It is an attractive Profession : and even in its lower walks it seems a branch of literature . There is independence of hours : the pay depends upon the man 's power of work : there are great openings in it and  --  to the rising lad at least - what seems a noble possibility in the shape of pay . Many distinguished men have been journalists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabbled with journalism ; and , since all of us can not be novelists , the young man might reflect that there are editors , sub-editors , assistant editors , news-editors , leader writers , descriptive writers , reviewers , dramatic critics , art and music critics , wanted for every paper . He could become a journalist and he could rise to the achievement of these ambitions . At first he rose a very little way , despite his ambition , because in every branch of letters , imperfect education is an insuperable obstacle . Still he could become news-editor , descriptive reporter , paragraph writer , and even , in the case of country papers , editor . Sometimes he passed from the office of the journal to that of one of the many societies , where he became secretary and succeeded in getting his name associated with some cause , which gave him some position and consideration . Whether he succeeded greatly or not , his whole object was to pass from the class which has no possible future to the class for which everything is open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only find the necessary funds , they should make what he had been unable to make , an attempt upon the prizes of the State . This was the situation at the beginning of the last decade of the nineteenth century . It is summed up by saying that all the avenues to honor and power were closed and barred to the lad who could not command a thousand pounds at least . Let us pass on . I have already , in the last chapter , considered the growth and development of the great educational movement whose origin belongs to the nineteenth century ; whose development so profoundly affects the history of our own . It began , like the spread of scientific knowledge , and the reforms in the Old Constitution , and everything else , with the introduction of railways . Before the end of the century the country was covered with schools , as it was also covered with railways . There was hardly a man or woman ' living when the nineteenth century ended who could not read ; there were few indeed who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements and was already completed when the pupil reached his fourteenth year . He was then taken from school and put to work , apprenticed-set to something which was to be his trade . Clever or stupid , keen of intellect or dull , that was to be the lot of the boy . He was set to learn how to earn his livelihood . About the year 1885 or 1890-no exact date can be fixed for the birth of a new idea-began a very remarkable extension of the educational movement . It was discovered by philanthropists that something ought to be done with the boys after they had left school . The first intentions seem to have been simply to keep them out of mischief . Having nothing to do the lads naturally took to loafing about the streets , smoking bad tobacco , drinking , gambling , and precocious love-making . It was also perceived by economists about the same time that unless something was done for technical . education , the old superiority of the British craftsman would speedily vanish . It was further pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the mastery of the merest elements , the tools by means of which knowledge could be acquired . In order , therefore , to carry on general education and to provide technical training there were started simultaneously in every great town , but especially in Lon // don , Technical Schools , " Continuation " Classes , Polytechnics , Young Men 's Associations and Clubs , Guilds for instruction and recreation-under whatever form they were known they were all schools . Then the young working lad was invited to enter himself at one of these places , and to spend his evenings there . " Come , " said the founders , " you are at an age when everything is new and everything is delightful . Give up all your present joys . Send the girl with whom you keep company , night after night , home to her mother . Put down your cherished cigarette , cease to stand about in bars , give up drinking beer , go no more to the music-hall . Abandon all that you delight in . And come to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us and work all the evening at books . " A strange invitation ! To forego delights and live laborious evenings . Stranger still , the lads accepted the invitation . They accepted in thousands . They consented to work every evening as well as every day . The inducements to join were , in fact , artfully devised with a full knowledge of boys ' nature . What a boy desires , over and above everything else , more than the company of a girl , more than idleness , more than gambling , more than beerdrinking , more than tobacco , is association with other lads of the same age . These Polytechnics or Institutes or Clubs gave him , first of all , that association . They provided him with societies of every kind . They added recreation to study ; pleasure to work . If half of the evening was spent in a class-room , or in a workshop , the other half was passed in orderly amusement . There was , moreover , every kind of choice ; the lad felt himself free ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not feel them ; there was a steady pressure upon him in certain directions , but he did not feel it ; in some there were prayer-meetings ; the boys were not obliged to go , but some time or other they found themselves present . Then there were some who wore the blue ribbon of temperance ; nobody was obliged to assume that symbol , but somehow most of them did , without feeling that they had been pressed to do so . For the very work and life and atmosphere of the place into which beer was not admitted gave them a dislike for beer , with its coarse and rough associations . Insensibly the boy who joined was led upward to a nobler and higher leveL The motives which were strong enough to persuade a working lad to work on , over hours , may be partly understood by considering one of these Institutions  --  the largest and the most popular  --  the Polytechnic of Regent Street , called familiarly the Regent Street " Poly , " with its thirteen thousand members . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than its educational side . It contained about forty clubs . The new member on joining was asked in a pamphlet these three questions : 1 . " Do you wish to make friends ? " 2 . " Are you anxious to improve your-self ' ? " 3 . " Do you seek the best opportunities of recreation in your leisure hours ? " Observe that the serious object is placed between the other two . What the Poly lads said to the new member was : " Come in and have a good old time with us . " It was for the good old time that the new member joined . Once in he could look about him and choose . The Gymnasium , the Boxing club , the Swimming Club , the Rollerskating Club , the Cricket , Football , Lawn Tennis , Athletic , Rowing , Cycling , Ramblers and Harriers Clubs all invited him to join . Surely , among so many clubs there must be one that he would like . Of course they had their showy uniform , their envied Captains and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their prizes . Or there was the Volunteer Corps , with its Artillery Brigade , and its Volunteer Medical Staff Corps . There was the Parliament , conducted on the same rules as that of the House of Commons . For the quieter lads there were Sketching , Natural History , Photographic , Orchestral , and Choral Societies . There was a Natural History Society and an Electrical Engineering Society . There were also associations for religious and moral objects ; a Christian Workers ' // Union , a Temperance Society , a Social League , a Polytechnic Mission , and a Bible Class . There were reading rooms and refreshment-rooms ; in the suburbs there were playing fields for them . Up the river was a house-boat for the Rowing Club , the largest on the Thames . Add to all this an intense " College feeling ; " an ardent enthusiasm for the Poly ; friendships the most faithful ; a wholesome , invigorating , stimulating atmosphere ; the encouragement always felt of brave endeavor and noble effort , and high principlein one word , the gift to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools and universities could offer that was best and most precious . Such an institution as the Polytechnic-mother and sister of so many others-was a revolution in itself . But for the second question : " Are you anxious to improve yourself ? " What answer was given ? Strange to say the answer was also very decidedly in the affirmative . The young fellows were anxious to improve themselves . Now mark the difference between these working lads and the boys from the public schools . Had such a question been put to the latter their answer would have been a contemptuous stare , or a contemptuous laugh . Improve themselves ? They were already improved . They were so far improved that nine-tenths of them were contented with the moderate amount of knowledge necessary for the practice of their professions . If one became a solicitor , a doctor , a schoolmaster , a barrister , a clergyman , it was sufficient for him , in most cases , just to pass the examinations . Then , no further improvement for the rest of their natural life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose ambitions were just awakening , who were just beginning to understand that there was every inducement to improve themselves , joined the classes and began to work , with as much zeal as they showed in their play . What they learned concerns us little . It may be recorded , however , that they learned everything . Practical trades were taught ; technical classes were held ; there was a School of Science in which such subjects as chemistry , physics , mathematics , mechanics , building were taught . There was a School of Art in which wood modelling , carving , and other minor arts were taught , as well as painting and drawing . There was a Commercial School for Arithmetic , Book-keeping , Shorthand , Typewriting , French , German , etc. , were taught ; there were Musical Classes , Elocution Classes , a School of Engineering , a School of Photography . Enough ; it will be seen that everything a lad might desire to learn he could learn and did learn . But the Polytechnic was only one of many such institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1893 , between two and three hundred , large and small ; there were nearly fifty branches of the University Extension scheme ; the Continuation classes were held in many Board Schools , while of special clubs , mostly for athletic purposes , the number was legion . As for the numbers enrolled in these associations , already in 1893 , when those things were all young , one finds 13,000 members of the Regent Street Poly ; 4,000 at the People 's Palace ; the same number at the Birkbeck ; the same at the Goldsmith 's Institute ; at the City of London College , 2,500 ; and so on . Of the Athletic Clubs the Cyclists ' Union alone contained no fewer than 20,000 members . Figures may mean anything . It is , however , significant that in a population of five millions , which gives perhaps 700,000 young men between fifteen and twenty , of whom about 100,000 were below the rank of craftsmen , and 100,000 above , there should have been found a few years after the introduction of the system , about 70,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be owned that only the more generous spirits  --  the nobler sort-were attracted by the Polytechnics . They were a first selection from the mass . Of these again , another selection was made : those few who studied the things which at first sight appeared to be least usefuL Everyone who knew a craft could see the wisdom of acqulring perfection in his trade ; everyone who was a clerk , or who hoped to become a clerk , // could see the advantage of learning shorthand , book-keeping , French and German . What did that boy aim at who studied Latin , Greek , and Matheruatics , matriculated and took his degree at the London University , then an examining body only ? Why did he learn these things ? He did not learn them , remember , in the perfunctory way in which a public school boy generally works through his subjects ; he learned as if he meant to know these subjects ; he devoured his books ; he tore the heart out of them ; he compelled them to give up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public school boy had everything given to him . When it was done , when he had acquired as much knowledge as any average boy from the best public school ; when he had read in the Poly Reading Room all that there was to read , what was he to do ? For when he looked about him he saw , stretching before him , fair and stately , the long avenues which led to distinction  --  but before each there was a toll-gate and at the gate stood a man saying , " Pay me first a thousand pounds . Then , and not till then , you shall enter . " Alas ! and he had not a sixpence-he , or his parents . And so perforce he must stand aside while other lads without his intellect and courage paid the money and were admitted . There was but one outlet . He might become a journalist . He had learned shorthand , a necessary accomplishment . Therefore , he got an appointment as reporter and general hand on a country paper . Such a youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he very soon became much more common . The charm of learning was discovered by one lad after another . The chance of exchanging the craftsman 's work for the scholar 's work , never thought of before , fired the brains of hundreds first , and thousands afterward . Then began a rage for learning . All those who had abilities even mediocre tried to escape their lot by working at the higher subjects . It was reproached to the Polytechnics that their original purpose , to bring the boys together for common discipline and orderly recreation , and to train them in their crafts , was departed from and that all their energies were now devoted to turning working lads into classical scholars , mathematicians , logicians , and historians . Nor was the complaint wholly unfounded . But it was too late to recede . The boys crowded to the classes ; they read and worked with incredible eagerness ; they thought that to be a man of books was better than to be a man with a saw and a plane . Ambition seized them-seized them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their stepping-stone . The recreative side of the Polytechnics was lost in the educational side . Never before had there been such an ardor , such a thirst for knowledge . Yet only for knowledge as a means to rise . And there was but one outlet . That , in the course of a few years , became congested . Journalism , as the number of papers increased , demanded more workmen , and still more . These young men from the Polytechnic filled up every vacancy . They had seized upon this profession and made it their own ; those who did not belong to them were gradually , but surely , ousted . It was recognized that it was the pro-. fession of the young man who wanted to get on . Some there were who affected to lament an alleged decay ; the old scholarly style , they said , was gone ; there was also gone the old reverence for authority , rank , and the established order . Perhaps the journal , as the new men made it , was above all vigorous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of the papers before their time . From their college  --  the old Poly-the young men carried away a love of truth and right dealing which , once imported into the newspaper press , made it an engine far more mighty-an influence far more potent-than ever it had been before . There may have been some loss in style , though many of them wrote gracefully and many showed on occasion a wonderful command of wit , sarcasm , and satire . But because the papers were always truthful the writers always knew what they wanted and so their work had the strength of directness . A few , but very few , continued at the work , whatever it might be , to which they had been apprenticed . Then their // lives were spent in a day of painful drudgery followed by an evening of delightful study . Very few heard of these men . Now and then one would be discovered by a clergyman working in his parish ; now and then one emerged from obscurity by means of a letter or a paper contributed to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet there was one . His case is remarkable because it first set rolling the ball of reform . He was by trade a metal turner and fitter ; he had the reputation of being an unsociable man because he went home every day after work and stayed there ; he was unmarried and lived alone in a small , four-roomed cottage near Kilburn , one of a collection of Workman 's villages . Here it was known that he had a room which he had furnished with a furnace , a table , shelves and bottles , and that he worked every evening at something . One day there appeared in a scientific paper an article containing an account of certain discoveries of the greatest importance , signed by a name utterly unknown to scientific men . The article was followed by others , all of the greatest interest and originality . The man himself had little idea of the importance of his own discoveries . When his cottage was besieged by leaders in the world of science , he was amazed ; he showed his simple laboratory to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them that he was a metal turner by trade , that he worked every day for an employer at a wage of thirty-five shillings a week , and that he was able to devote his evenings to reading and research . They made him an F.RS. , the first working man who had ever attained that honor . They tried to get him put upon the Civil List , but the First Lord of the Treasury had already , according to the usual custom , given away the annual grant made by the House for Literature , Science and Art , to the widows and daughters of Civil servants . This attempt failing , the Royal Society , in or4er to take him away from his drudgery , created a small sinecure post for him , and in this way found an excuse for giving him a pension . Then some writer in a London Daily asked how it was that with his genius for science , which , it was now recalled , had been remarked while he was a student at the South London Poly , this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer was , " Because there is no opening for such an one . " It is very astonishing , when we consider the obvious nature of certain truths , to remark how slow man is to find them out . Now this exclusion of all those who could not afford to pay his toll to the man at the gate , had , up to that moment , been accepted as if it were a law of Nature . As in other things , men said , if they talked about the matter at all , " What is , must be . What is , shall be . What is , has always been . What is , has been ordained by God himself . " There is nothing more difficult than to effect a reform in men 's minds . The reformer has , first , to persuade people to listen . Sometimes he never succeeds , even in this , the very beginning . When they do listen , the thing , being new to them , irritates them . They therefore call him names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can they put him in prison , hang him , burn him . If they can not do this , and he goes on preaching new things , they presently begin to listen with more respect . One or two converts are made . The reformer expands his views ; his demands become larger ; his claims far exceed the modest dimensions of his first timid words . And so the reform , bit by bit , is effected . At first , then , the demand was for nothing more than an easier entrance into the scientific world . This naturally rose out of the case . " Let us , " they said , " take care that to such a man as this any and every branch of science shall be thrown open . But for that purpose it is necessary that scholarships , whether given at school or college , shall be sufficient for the maintenance as well as for the tuition fees of those who hold them . " These scholarships , it was argued , had been founded for poor students and belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , with one or two exceptious , were in favor of " restoring " - that was the phrase- " his scholarships ; " " his , " it was said , assuming that they were his // originally  --  to the poor man . In vain was it pointed out that these scholarships had been for the most part founded in recent times when public schools and universities had long become the property of the richer class , and that they were needed as aids for those who were not rich , not as means of maintenance for those who wanted to rise out from one class into another . The cry was raised at the general Election : the majority came into power pledged to the hilt to restore his scholarships to the poor student . Then , of course , a compromise was effected . There was created a class of scholarships at certain public schools , for which candidates had to produce evidence that they possessed nothing , and that their parents would not assist them . Similar scholarships were created at Oxford and Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that concessions opening all the advantages that the public schools and universities had to give would prove sufficient . By this time the country was fully awakened to the danger of having thrown upon their hands a great class of young men who thought themselves too well educated for any of the lower kinds of work , and were too numerous for the only work open to them . No one , as yet , it must be remembered , had ventured to propose throwing open the Professions . The concessions were found , however , to make very little difference . Now and then a lad with a scholarship forced his way to the head of a public school , and carried off the highest honors at the liJuiversity . Mostly , however , the poor scholar was uncomfortable ; he could neither speak , nor think , nor behave like his fellows ; the atmosphere chilled him ; too often he failed to justify the early promise ; if he succeeded in getting a " poor 's scholarship at college , he too often ended his University career with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , and so he was again face to face with the question : What to do ' ? His college would not continue to support him . He could not get a mastership in a good school because there was a prejudice against " poor 's scholars , who were supposed incapable of acquiring the manners of a gentleman . So he , too , fell back upon the only outlet , and tried to become a journalist . Every day the pressure increased ; the pay of the journalist went down ; work could be got for next to nothing , and still the lads poured into the classes by the thousand , all hoping to exchange the curse of labor by their hands for that of labor by the pen . No one as yet had perceived the great truth which has so enormously increased the happiness of our time , that all labor is honorable and respectable , though to some kinds of labor we assign greater , and some lesser , honor . The one thought was to leave the ranks of the workingman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suffer and starve in silence . On the contrary , they were continually proclaiming their woes ; the papers were filled with letters and articles . " What shall we do with our boys ? " was the heading that one saw every day , somewhere or other . What , indeed ! No one ventured to say that they had better go back to their trade ; no one ventured to point out that a man might be a good cabinet-maker although he knew the Integral Calculus . If one timidly asked what good purpose was gained by making so many scholars , that man was called Philistine , first ; obstructive , next ; and other stronger names afterward . And yet no one ventured to point out that all the professions-and not science only , through the universities-might be thrown open . Sooner or later this suggestion was certain to be made . It appeared , first of all , in an unsigned letter addressed to one of the evening papers . The writer of the letter was almost certainly one of the suffering class . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described it above , quite simply and truly . He showed , as I have shown , that the Professions and the Services were closed to those who had no money . And he advanced for the first time the audacious proposal that they should be thrown open to all on the simple condition of passing an examination . " This examination , " he said , " may be made as severe as can be desired or devised . There is no examina* // tion so severe that the students of our Polytechnics can not face and pass it triumphantly . Let the examination , if you will , be intended to admit none but those who have taken or can take first - class Honors . The Poly students need not fear to face a standard even so high as this . Why should the higher walks of life be reserved for those who have money to begin with ? Why should money stand in the way of honor ? Among the thousands of young men who have profited by the opportunities offered to them there must be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born to be doctors ; some who are born to be preachers ; some who are born to be administrators . " And so on , at length . It was not , however , by a letter in a paper , or by the leading articles and the correspondence which followed that the suggested change was effected . But the idea was started . It was talked about ; it grew : as the pressure increased it grew more and more . Meetings were held at which violent speeches were delivered : the question of opening the Professions was declared of national importance ; at the General Election which followed some months after the appearance of the letter , members were returned who were pledged to promote the immediate throwing open of all the Professions to all who could pass a certain examination ; and the first step was taken in opening all commissions in the Army to competitive examination . The Professions , however , remained obstinate . Law and Medicine refnsed to make the least concession . It was not until an Act of Parliament compelled them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Physicians , Surgeons , and Apothecaries consented to admit all-comers without fees and by examination alone . Then followed such a rush into the Professions as had never before been witnessed . Already too full , they became at once absolutely congested and choked . Every other man was either a doctor or a solicitor . It was at first thought that by making examinations of the greatest severity possible the rush might be arrested . But this proved impossible , for the simple reason that an examination for admission , necessarily a mere " pass " examination must be governed and limited by the intellect of the average candidate . Moreover , in Medicine , if too severe an examination is proposed , the candidate sacrifices actual practice and observation in the Hospital wards to book-work . Therefore the examinations remained much as they always had been , and all the clever lads from all the Polytechnics became , in an incredibly short time , members of the Learned Professions . There can be no doubt that the Bench and the Bar , that Medicine and Surgery , owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . Great names occur to every one which belong to this and that Polytechnic , and are written on the walls in letters of gold as an encouragement to succeeding generations . One would not go back to the old state of things . At the same time there were losses and there are regrets . So great , for instance , was the competition in Medicine that the sixpenny General Practitioner established himself everywhere , even in the most fashionable quarters ; so nnmerous were solicitors that the old system of a recognized tariff was swept away and gave place to open competition as in trade . That the two branches of the law should be fused into one was inevitable ; that the splendid incomes formerly derived from successful practice should disappear was also a matter of course . And there were many who regretted not only the loss of the old professional rules and the old incomes , but also the old professional esprit de corps  --  the old jealousy for the honor and dignity of the profession : the old brotherhood . All this was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates sent in contracts for the job ; the physicians undertook a case for *o much ; the sur-* geon operated for a contract price ; the usages of trade were all transferred to the Professions . As for the Services , the Navy remained an aristocratic body ; boys were received too young for the Polytechnic lads to have a chance ; also , the pay was too small to tempt them , and the work was too scientific . In the Army a few appeared from time to time , but it can not // be said that as officers the working classes made a good figure . They were not accustomed to command ; they were wanting in the manners of the camp as well as those of the court ; they were neither polished enough nor rough enough ; the influence of the Poly might produce good soldiers-obedient , highprincipled , and brave ; but it could not produce good officers , who must be , to begin with , lads born in the atmosphere of authority , the sons of gentlemen or the sons of officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , will remember the case of the general-once a Poly boy-who successfully defended Herat against an overwhelming host of Russians in the year 1935 . It was not enough to throw open the Professions . Some there were in which , whether they were thrown open or not , a new-coiner without family or capital or influence could never get any work . Thus it would seem that Engineering was a profession very favorable to such new-comers . It proved the contrary . All engineers in practice had pupilssons , cousins , nephews  --  to whom they gave their appointments . To the newcomer nothing was given . What good , then , had been effected by this revolution ? Nothing but the crowding into the learned Professions of penniless , clever lads ? Nothing but the destruction of the old dignity and self-respect of Law and Medicine ? Nothing but the degradation of a Profession to the competition of trade ? Much more than this had been achieved . The Democratic movement which had marked the nineteenth century received its final impulse from this great change . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of that century , had ceased to represent the old aristocracy . The old names were , for the most part , extinct . A Cecil , a Stanley , a Howard , a Neville , a Bruce , might yet be found , but by far the greater part of the Peers were of yesterday . Nor could the House be kept up at all but for new creations . They were made from rich trade or from the Law , the latter conferring respect and dignity upon the House . But lawyers could no longer be made Peers . They were rough in manners , and they had no longer great incomes . Moreover , the nation demanded that its honors should be equally bestowed upon all those who rendered service to the State , and all were poor . Now a House of poor Lords is absurd . Equally absurd is a House of Lords all brewers . Hence the fall of the House of Lords was certain . In the year 1924 it was finally abolished . In the next chapter I propose to relate what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the grant of the higher education to working lads caused the Conquest of the Professions and brought about the change I have indicated . We have seen how this revolution was bound to sweep away in its course the last relics of the old aristocratic constitution of the country . It remains to be told how learning , when it became the common possession of all clever lads , ceased to be a possession by which money could be made , except by the very foremost . Then the boys went back to their trades . If the reign of the gentleman is over , the learning and the power and culture that has belonged to the gentleman now belongs to the craftsman . This , at least , must be admitted to be pure gain . For one man who read and studied and thought one hundred years ago , there are now a thousand . Editions of good books are now issued by a hundred thousand at a time . The Professions are still the avenues to honors . Still , as before , the men whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Advocate , the great Preacher , the great Engineer , the great Surgeon , the great Dramatist , the great Novelist , the great Poet . That the national honors no longer take the form of the Peerage will not , I think , at this hour , be admitted to be a subject for regret by even the stanchest Conservative.
