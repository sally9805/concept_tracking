THE MUNICIPAL SERVICE OF BOSTON . IT is everywhere asserted that in the government of large cities the American democracy finds its severest test , and manifests most plainly its shortcomings . Thousands of pages have been written about these shortcomings by the keenest students and critics , and there has been denunciation of municipal corruption , discussion of particular municipal departments or functions , suggestion for municipal reform , to the verge of weariness . One aspect of the matter , however , has generally been overlooked . There has been little attempt to set forth com prehensively what service is rendered by a great city to its citizens , and what is the quality of the service . Commonly we take municipal government for granted ; we are irritated by its failures , perhaps we are proud of one of its successes , but seldom do we try to estimate the worth of our municipal service as a whole , in comparison either with some abstract standard of our own or with the municipal government of some other country or time . What we get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the principal subject of this article . // To have much value , a description of municipal service must be verified by experience . The statute-book , which tells what a city may do or ought to do , can not be trusted , nor can the rose-colored official reports of the city 's magistrates . On the other hand , it is not always safe to infer that the citizens are ill served because their servant 's character is not all that it should be . As the workings of municipal government differ from city to city , I propose to take the city of Boston , the fourth in size in the United States , and consider briefly , and without regard to the public or private character of its officials , what it does for its citizens . The experience of one city , I believe , will throw more light upon the government of American cities in gelleral than will a discussion of municipal service in the abstract . Within the compass of a magazine article it is not possible to enter into considerable detail : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; statements must be made unsupported , which it would take pages to prove ; in disputed matters the better opinion must sometimes be expressed too absolutely ; to some people not a few judgments will seem colorless , to others they may appear extravagant . I believe , however , that the following review of Boston 's municipal service will be recognized as accurate in substance . How far Boston 's service is typical of that of American cities I can not say ; there are differences of detail , with strong resemblances of type . The complaints of the misgovernment of Boston are the same in kind as those made elsewhere in the United States , though they maybe slightly less in degree . Boston 's citizens are profoundly dissatisfied with the present condition of things . The first duty of government , the protection of life and limb , Boston discharges , on the whole , pretty well . The peaceable individual is here as secure against violence as he is anywhere in the world ; indeed , I can not now recall an acquaintance with anybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston by willful crime . The danger to the person from the reckless use of the streets by vehicles and street cars will be considered later . The protection of property against crime is not nearly so absolute as that afforded to the person . How the protection here given compares with thal* given by European cities can not be stated precisely , but the difference is not great . Even the citizen of Boston most disposed to complain of municipal misgovernment finds little fault with the police in the discharge of their ordinary duties . The conduct of the police in matters not immediately connected with the protection of persons and property , especially in the enforcement of the liquor laws and the laws against prostitution and gambling , is less satisfactory . Bribery is not unknown , but it is not common , and does not increase . It should be said , also , that in Boston the laws on these subjects are strict , compared with those of European countries , and even with those which govern other great American cities , and the vices aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Passing from the first necessities of government , we come to the services which are next demanded of a city by its citizens , - water , sewers , streets , fire department , schools , and the care of paupers . When municipal water - works were first established , about fifty years ago , the source of supply was excellent in quality and abundant in quantity . This condition lasted a long time , but an additional supply , afterward obtained from an inferior source , proved decidedly unpleasant in color and taste . At no time , however , were the impurities of a sort to endanger health , and the color and taste of the city 's water are now fairly good . Within a year or two the metropolitan district will have its principal source of supply in the Nashua River : the quality // of the water will then be excellent , and its quantity abundant for the needs of a generation . This last great work is carried on by a commission appointed by the governor of the commonwealth , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of the water will still be under local control . The cost of the water-works has been paid by the water-takers , and not from the general taxes ; that is to say , the water-rates have paid the cost of annual operation and interest on the money borrowed , and have established a sinking fund which will pay off the loans at maturity . In time , therefore , the city should own a valuable water-plant fully paid for . As a business venture , in spite of occasional jobbery and corruption , the Boston water-works have been fairly but not brilliantly successful . The rates are still high compared with those of other American cities , but recently they have been much reduced ; the mains have been extended into the newly built parts of the city with reasonable dispatch . The sewers of Boston have been improved with increasing knowledge of sanitary matters , and are now satisfactory . No use is made of the sewage ; its profitable use by a city situated like Boston is of doubtful possibility . The attempt to collect from those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been successful ; this cost is defrayed mostly from the general taxes . A part of the system has been constructed and is operated by a metropolitan sewer commission appointed by the governor . The streets of Boston , like those of nearly all European cities , were originally laid out haphazard , and numerous hills made them more than ordinarily crooked and narrow . Much has since been done to widen and straighten them , but often with insufficient foresight . How far the inadequacy of the streets is due to their unexpected occupation by street cars , how far to lack of traffic regulations , is hard to say . Not a little of the trouble is due to the nature of the case rather than to the direct fault of the municipal government . The sidewalks of Boston afford to foot-passengcrs convenient passage ; in a rapidly growing suburb they sometimes lag behind other improvements , but usually accommodation is provided nearly as soon as it can reasonably be expected . The cost is largely borne by the abutter . The pavement of the streets , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is safe and convenient at first , but the repair is by no means equal to the original construction . Street repair should be constant ; and if trifling repairs be made daily , costly reconstruction will be needed but seldom . Not only is the pavement of various sorts suffered to wear out , but it is also torn up frequently in order to suit the convenience of municipal departments , of private individuals , and of corporations using the streets , such as the gas company and the street railway . The law requires that the pavement be replaced in its former condition by the individual or corporation benefited ; but this is a physical impossibility . Again , the use of the streets permitted by law and custom is wasteful of space , and not infrequently dangerous to life and limb ; regulation of the traffic is lax or wanting , and vehicles are ale lowed to block a street in Boston which , under the regulations enforced in London , would afford convenient passage to twice as many . This evil , however , is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault of the municipal government itself . Proper control of traffic is commonly deemed oppressive , at any rate when first introduced , and we prefer to widen a street rather than to regulate its use . The watering of macadamized streets , required by the climate of New England , is done by the city to an increasing extent . The work is difficult and the results are not altogether satisfactory , but within two or three years 313 // there has been a marked improvement . Both the mud and the dust are nuisances , in some degree inevitable so long as the citizens prefer macadamized streets to those paved with stone blocks , in some degree caused by the imperfect repair and the disturbance just mentioned . Of the cleanliness of the streets it is difficult to speak definitely , as cleanliness is largely a matter of individual opinion . Boston 's condition in this respect is not altogether satisfactory , but , except in a few localities , it is generally fair , and has improved within five years . Considering the extent of Boston 's territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston are like those of other American cities , and hence fires are frequent and destructive , much more so than in Europe . The cost of European construction is so much greater , however , that Americans choose to pay higher insurance rates and larger bills for a fire department rather than incur this increased cost . If we bear in mind these limitations , we shall find the fire department of Boston reasonably and increasingly efficient . To pronounce authoritatively upon the schools of Boston would be difficult for an expert , and presumptuous in any one else . A few of the oldest schoolhouses do not meet the modern requirements of ventilation and arrangement . At the opening of the school year a few schools are overcrowded , until some of the children have been distributed among neighboring schools . In general , however , the accommodations are at least fairly good , and better than those of the most expensive private day - schools . That the teaching also is fairly good may safely be asserted ; earnest attempts to secure better results naturally produce dissatisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , but the teachers are intelligent , and zealously strive to raise the standard of instruction . We boast of our schools less confidently than we used to do , but we may recognize , if we will , their great improvement . An investigation of the pauper institutions of the city , made three or four years ago , showed that their administration was free from serious abuse , though its methods were somewhat antiquated , and though it suffered from that rarest vice of a great American city , excessive frugality . This administration has since greatly improved , and the paupers of Boston are now maintained as generously as those of a great city have ever been in the history of manUnd . Th* administration of the penal institutions is not altogether so satisfactory . Passing to those municipal services which are commonly regarded as desirable or ornamental rather than essential , we find that Boston admirably maintains the greatest public library in the world , the efficient administration of which can hardly be overpraised . The system of parks , including those of the so-called metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably unequaled , and the best landscape architects in the country have been little trammeled in laying it out . Until recently there have been no public baths , except for summer use , but one or two have just been opened . The city hospital is excellently administered , and one of its newer buildings has received the highest expert commendation . The enterprises undertaken by the city with the hope of profit or recompense have had a varied fate . Mention has been made of the water-works . The ferries between the island of East Boston and the mainland have done , at the lowest rates , all that can be done by ferries , but their net cost to the city has been heavy , and does not diminish . In order to relieve the congestion of the streets by putting the street cars under ground , a subway has been built at public expense . This has been leased for twenty years to a street railway company , at a rent sufficient to provide for // repairs and for interest on the bonds issued to defray its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the retirement of these bonds at their maturity in forty years . A forty years ' lease could have been made which would have provided for the complete retirement of the bonds , and thus wouM have delivered the subway free of cost to the city at the termination of the lease , had public opinion approved tying up the city 's property for so long a term . This successful business venture of more than six million dollars has stimulated an extension of the subway system . ' What , then , is the general conclusion from these details ? Regardless of cost , how does the service given by Boston compare with that which might be expected , not of an administration of seraphim , but of a business enterprise directed by the ability which successful private corporations must command ? Judged by this standard and irrespective of cost , Boston 's municipal service in respect of its police , water , sewers , hospital , fire department , schools , public library , and parks is good , in respect of its public charitable institutions pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimating the quality of municipal service , there is danger , as was pointed out by Mr. Godkin in the November Atlantic , that we shall take existing conditions for granted , and so set for ourselves too low a standard . There is like dange* as regards our railroads and our dwelling - houses , our manners and our morals . Doubtless it is better to be unduly dissatisfied with ourselves than to boast , but there is danger also of indiscriminate complaint which shall discourage improvement instead of helping it , and shall waste upon minor shortcomings the energy which is needed to cure the gravest evils . To expect that municipal service will be better in quality than the ser1 Students of American municipal government should study carefully The City Government of Boston , a valedictory address delivered vice which hope of gain secures from individuals or business corporations is idle , and with the latter service municipal service should be compared . It may be said that there are services , other than those mentioned , which the city ought to furnish , but does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . None of these , however , are generally recognized as obligatory upon a municipality . The variety of Boston 's service is continually increasing , and most of the severest critics are of opinion that the city now undertakes too much rather than too little . About a year ago there was published a study of the administration of Glasgow , written in a spirit of respectable pride by two of its officials . On comparison of the statements of this book with the condition of affairs in Boston , it appears pretty clearly that in the matter of police , water , and fire department the service of one city is about as good as that of the other . Glasgow excels in the laying out and care of its streets and in its public baths , Boston in its sewers , parks , schools , and in the care of its poor . Glasgow has no public library , and apparently has no hospital supported by the municipality ; it has a municipal art gallery and museum , institutions provided and administered in Boston by private generosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has purchased and improved a considerable tract of land ; Boston has constructed and leased the subway on advantageous terms . The experiment of Glasgow in operating a tramway has been carried on for so short a time , upon so small a scale , and with such doubtful results that no valuable conclusion can yet be drawn from it . Upon the whole , the public service of Boston is rather more extensive than that rendered by Glasgow , and in quality would seem to be quite as good . by Mayor Matthews in 1895 , perhaps the most authoritative statement concerning municipal government ever made in this country . // Thus far I have considered municipal service regardless of its cost ; cost , however , is of the first importance . To compare the burden of taxation under one system with that under another is difficult . The nominal tax-rate of New York , for example , is very much higher than that of Boston , but in the former city the valuation of real estate is much lower , and other property escapes taxation almost altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as setting a sufficiently exalted standard of municipal administration . This much may be said for Boston : its tax - rate is lower than that of the great majority of the rural towns of Massachusetts governed by the town meeting , and it is no higher than it was ten or fifteen years ago . In comparison with the selling value , the assessment of real estate is now little higher than it was then , and the assessment of personal property is distinctly lower . If the present annual expenses of the city were defrayed from the present annual tax-levy , they would not impose on the citizens what is considered , in the United States , to be an undue burden of taxation . Unfortunately , this is not the case . About twelve years ago a law was passed limiting the tax-rate which Boston might impose , and the amount of money which it might borrow . The limitations were fixed in order to secure economy , hut they have failed to accomplish their object . The tax - rate , indeed , has been kept almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only borrowed up to the debt limit for various purposes , but has obtained from the legislature permission to borrow outside it for parks , schoolhouses , court-house , public library , and so forth . So often has this been done that the debt outside the limit ( exclusive of the water debt , which was excepted by the original act ) is now nearly as large as the debt inside the limit . Beyond all this debt , the metropolitan commissions , which deal with the water , sewers , and parks of the metropolitan dis trict , have incurred a large and increasing debt in the name of the commonwealth , the larger part of which must be reimbursed by Boston . It is safe to say that many of those concerned with the government of the city now expect to meet extraordinary expenses for permanent im*rovements with money borrowed outside the debt limit , the money borrowed inside the limit being used to defray expenses which should be paid at once by annual taxation . Summing up , we find that Boston 's municipal service is extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good quality ; that thus far its cost has not been a very heavy burden upon the taxpayers , but that it has been procured by reckless borrowing , rendered possible by the fall in the rate of interest and by various juggling with accounts . How far has this great expense been required in order to provide municipal service of the present extent and quality , and how far is it the result of inefficiency and dishonesty ? Granted that we are to have the service , how much more do we pay for it than we ought ? This , of course , is a hard question , to which intelligent persons would give very different answers . In general , we may fairly say that there is , or has been , more or less of extravagant , unbusinesslike , or corrupt method in nearly all the city 's departments . In some the waste has been large , in others much less . Had all existing public works been established and maintained efficiently and economically , the city 's debt would now be considerably less than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The very best administration known to this country could not have provided the citizens with their water , sewers , fire department , parks , hospitals , library , and the rest without a much larger yearly tax or a dangerous mortgaging of the city 's future . Though Boston 's return for money spent is no doubt less than that of a successful business corporation , it // should be noted also that there are few great corporations - few railroads , for example - which in half a century of existence have not at some time and in some way suffered materially from extravagant , inefficient , and even corrupt manaoement . In an article published in The Forum for November , 1892 , Mr. Joseph Chainberlain , a man equally familiar with local and with national administration in Great Britain , compared the governments of Boston and Birmingham in respect of their economic efficiency . According to his figures , a dollar in Birmingham produces about five times the result that it produces in Boston . This conclusion is startling , and arouses our incredulity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a few errors of detail almost unavoidable by a foreigner , and the ratio which he fixes at five to one can be reduced to about three to one without much difficulty . Though his opinion is otherwise , his article makes it clear that the municipal service of Birmingham is considerably less extensive than that of Boston : its public library , its city hospital , and its parks , for instance , are manifestly of a class quite different from that of Boston 's corresponding institutions . When all allowances have been made , however , the difference in the economic efficiency of the two governments is very disquieting to a citizen of Boston . Wherein does the difference lie ? In wages it is very great . The cost of day labor to the city of Boston is about twice as high as its cost to Birmingham , partly because of the higher general scale of wages in this country , and partly because the wages of municipal laborers here are higher in proportion to those paid by private employers than is the case in England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those employees who rank above the day laborer is equally great . The policemen of Birmingham re ceive about four hundred dollars a year , those of Boston about a thousand dollars . The tendency to fix the rate of wages paid by the municipality above that which is paid by other employers has begun to manifest itself in England , according to Mr. Chamberlain , but it has not advanced there as far as it has done here . The salaries paid to the heads of departments are about the same in both cities . Birmingham , again , profits by the valuable executive work performed without pay by the members of its city council , while the city council of Boston is forbidden to discharge executive functions . A good deal of this excellent unpaid work is done in Boston by commissioners and members of boards of trustees , but Birmingham , apparently , saves much of the money spent in Boston on elaborate administrative staffs . Here , as in other respects , the service of Boston is more extended , but this greater extension does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , unpaid service in some city departments has been tried by us and found unsatisfactory ; and , as will be shown further on , there is reason to suppose that the English system may not work so well in the future as it has done in the past . It should be said that , in spite of our less economic efficiency , the water-works of Boston , its largest municipal undertaking , seem to yield a net profit to the city much larger than do those of Birmingham How the waterrates compare I do not know . A closer study of Mr. Chamberlain 's figures may further affect his conclusions , but such figures as his are well worth detailed examination and comparison by our municipal reformers . Beside such examination and comparison , generalized rhapsodies on the excellence of European municipal government are quite insignificant . It is often said that , in addition to the loss arising from extravagance and corruption , from higher wages and elaborate administrative machinery , Boston // has suffered great loss by neglecting a proper source of revenue . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets by gas and electric companies , by street railways and the like , and the omission is set down to corruption of the city 's officers by the corporations . Doubtless this is the case to some extent , but there are concurrent influences much more powerful . Compared to the use of the streets made by street railways , the use made by other corporations is almost insignificant . It would be absurd to exact rent from a gas company while charging a street railway nothing . The proposal to make street railways pay for their occupation of the streets by their tracks has been bitterly resisted by the traveling public , which desires the cheapest possible transportation . That the city should largely subsidize a street railway to carry passengers at less than actual cost seems to many passengers a desirable use of public money . The city should collect rent , as I believe , from all to whom is granted a peculiar or exclusive use of the city 's property , but the failure to obtain this rent is due far more to public opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that , even with economical management , the existing municipal service could not be established and maintained without larger annual taxes or an inordinate debt . This expensive service , we are told , is demanded chiefly by those citizens who are not assessed for taxes , and by the city 's officials who wish to pocket a share of the money spent . To some extent the assertion is true ; even honest officials magnify the importance of their several departments , and the poorer citizens always favor large appropriations , failing to recognize tbat they pay , though indirectly , their full share of the taxes . Nearly or quite every large expenditure of the public money has been urged , however , not only by the classes just mentioned , but also by large taxpayers and public-spirited citizens . These have often petitioned the legislature to permit the city to borrow money outside the debt limit for a favorite project , - for the public library , parks , highways , and schoolhouses ; indeed , the opposition to large expenditures and to borrowing outside the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city had been confined , let us say , to the richer half of the citizens , I doubt if a single municipal luxury would have been foregone , though possibly the money raised might have been made to go further . Even subsidizing the street railways by exemption from rent for the use of the streets is often advocated by the well - to - do , though seldom by those who are distinctly rich . The result of our inquiry is this : We have extensive and pretty good service , for which we pay more than we ought , but which , though it were procured with the best economy yet attained in this country , would still be so expensive that we should insist upon charging its cost to posterity . We have a debt , appalling in size after all proper deductions have been made , and increasing at a tremendous rate , its size and its increase partly concealed by devices of bookkeeping . This is a condition of affairs neither satisfactory nor hopeless , one which calls for discriminating action rather than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the greatest of our municipal dangers , - a danger to be dreaded the more because it has been incurred with the approval of practically all our citizens , and not chiefly through the wiles of a corrupt government . Thus far little has been said about that which is usually most emphasized in the discussion of American municipal government , to wit , the corruption of the city 's officials . The principal object of this article is to consider the quantity and quality of municipal service . Occasionally , at least , it is well to put out of // sight pers*nal considerations , and to devote our attention exclusively to the qualities of things . But if we pass from the service itself to those who are the city 's agents in rendering it , we find , as we should expect , marked varieties of character among Boston 's officials . The quality of the members of the city council is distinctly poor . Doubtless it has recently contained some honest , well-intentioned members , but in it have sat many men without ostensible means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally chosen to manage large and important private business . Moreover , it is pretty clear that the membership of the city council is not only poor , but deteriorating . The executive departments , on the other hand , have recently contained many men not only respectable , but of marked ability and of the highest standing in the community . On ? the boards which govern the public library , the city hospital , the insane asylum , and the children 's department , among the overseers of the poor , on the park commissions , both city and metropolitan , on the transit commission ( which is building the subway ) , at the head of the fire department , and in other places , have been men who would naturally be chosen to fill the highest positions of private and corporate trust . Their presence accounts for much of the good service which has been described . It must not be supposed , of course , that all the executive officers of Boston are of the last - mentioned sort . No business corporation in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability . Within the past few years , moreover , some of the city 's departments have been directed by men far below the minimum standard of honesty and efficiency established in successful business affairs . Under a man of this kind , a department has sometimes become generally inefficient and corrupt ; sometimes it has continued to discharge its functions pretty well by means of respectable subordinates and clerks . In spite of these shortcomings , all too numerous and in some cases utterly disgraceful , the executive officers of the city are far superior in character and ability to the members of the city council . The cause of this general difference between the executive departments of the city and its legislature is not far to seek . Before 1885 much of the administration of Boston was in the hands of committees of the city council , as is still the case in most other cities of Massachusetts . In 1885 , partly because of the unsatisfactory work of these committees , and partly because of a theoretical preference for a separation of powers , the state legislature deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one recognized then , and but few recognize now , that nearly all municipal functions are administrative . The annual legislation of the city , as set out in its ordinances , is unimportaut . The tax rate is limited by statute , and the money obtained by it , for the most part , is pledged to meet the needs of the several departments , so that the city council has very little moIiey left in its disposition . Almost the only considerable legislative function remaining is the authorization of loans . This function certainly is most important , and far too little attention is now given to its discharge , but it can not provide two legislative chambers with business for some forty sittings apiece . These sittings are spent chiefly in idle discussion , and in the attempt , usually vaii* , to hamper the executive . Service in these bodies is not only disagreeahle but profitless , and the quality of their membership naturally deteriorates* Without a sense of responsibility men can do little that is good . Considerable power is a prerequisite of serious responsibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore incompetent to discharge properly even those few // functions which still belong to it . Frequent and frantic appeals are made to the citizens to elect better men to the city council ; but intelligent and busy men can not be expected to give days and weeks of their time to membership in an irresponsible debating club . It will naturally be asked if the executive has improved while the legislature has been deteriorating . I think that it has , on the whole . Inefficiency and corruption are found in some executive departments , but though the city is much larger than it was twelve years ago , and though its functions are more numerous and complicated , its administration has improved . The changes made in l88* , and similar changes made since , have been of very great advantage . They have given us better service and more honest and efficient administration than would have been possible in our growing city under the old system . Notable improvement has been made , for example , in respect of the police , the city hospital , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compared to what we have gained , an increased rate of deterioration in the already deteriorating city council is felt to be a small thing . It may be urged that in Great Britain executive power is entrusted to the municipal legislature with excellent results . We should observe , however , that until within a short time municipal suffrage in Great Britain has been very limited , and the traditions of the old order of things have not disappeared . Even now municipal suffrage is not universal , in our sense of the word . Again , Mr. Chamberlain 's remark that dishonesty and corruption do not exist in England has received sad contradiction within the past few years , - a contradiction so strong that we must needs doubt if the remark was ever quite justified . The recent experience of the London County Council indicates that Great Britain not improbably has before it an era of municipal *isgovernment like that from which we are trying to emerge . Never , in the United States , have the supposed exigencies of partisan politics led to more cynical excuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago is by no means so remarkable as the indifference with which its discovery was received . The consideration of American political problems is usually so much taken up with moral exhortation , and with the exhibition of some panacea for existing evils , that a mere statement of things as they are is deemed colorless and profitless ; yet surely a study of existing conditions is valuable preparation for reforming them . No nostrum exists which will secure either perfect municipal government or the perfect administration of a railroad . Good government and good administratiQn are the slowly produced results of watchfnl study , intelligent observation , and patient experiment . - The most zealous devotion can not attain to it in a hurry . It was the fashion , a century ago , to believe that good government was secured by the sudden adoption of a political system based upon human nature in the abstract , and upon the Eternal Fitness of Things . Now we know better than this ; but we have fallen into another error , less fundamental , but still considerable . Many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of good men . Doubtless this is a thing ever to be desired , and personal moral earnestness among electors and elected is the strongest and safest motive for reform . Not only , however , must we shape the method and machinery of our choice so as to lead naturally to the selection of the best men , but we must also face the practical certainty that even with the best methods the best men will not always be chosen to office , and therefore we must make preparation for the inevitable . Institutions have their impor // tance as well as men , and we have to establish conditions which will enable the saint to do the maximum of good while restraining the sinner to the minimum of harm . Still greater is the importance of giving to the average official , who is neither saint nor sinner , his best opportunity of useful public service . This sort of reform , involving nice considerations of political judgment , and therefore less attractive to many men than an electoral campaign fought on moral issues , has lately made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes made in 1885 . The trustees of the public library and of the city hospital , elected by the city council , were not satisfactory . An attempt to improve the choice under the laws then existing would probably have failed , so the power of appointment was transferred to the mayor with great advantage . The administration of the police was unsatisfactory ; the power of appointing the police commissioners was transferred to the governor , and , although scandal has not been altogether avoided , the improvement in administration has been marked . Twice within two years the form of government of the city 's charitable institutions has been radically changed , each time with good results . The carrying on of several great public works , like that involved in the water-supply of the metropolitan district , has been entrusted to commissions appointed by the governor , which have shown as great economy , efficiency , and promptness as could be hoped for from the best private management . It has been objected that these commissions are imposed upon the city or the metropolitan district from without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to fix . There is weight in the objection . Local home rule is an attractive cry , and some small evils had better be borne until the people of a given locality have themselves found out the cure . The government of great modern cities , however , is distinctly in the experimental stage , and it may be that , for a time at least , certain functions , hitherto conimonly discharged by municipalities , should be undertaken by the state . In any case , it is safe to say that , until the critics can find a method of combining greater local responsibility with equal efficiency , these commissions will find favor in the eyes of reasonable men . Good municipal service is the end sought , and the Anglo-Saxon race has always preferred to submit its political methods to the test of practical working rather than to that of logical completeness . The following observations are suggested by a review of Boston 's municipal service . The service itself is worst in respect of the highways . If our streets were well laid out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic through them were properly controlled , the citizens of Boston would have no very severe complaint to make of the quantity and quality of the municipal service . If , however , the people of Boston expect that this service is to be maintained , extended , and improved , they must be prepared to pay considerably higher annual taxes than , those now exacted . A more honest and efficient administration will make a dollar go further than it goes now , but it can not furnish even the existing service without incurring a debt munch too large . The greatest danger to be feared from the present course of Boston 's municipal administration is a crushing debt . We must go without some of our luxuries , Or we must put our hands into our pockets and pay for them . Time election of good men to office will not keep the debt within proper limits . Its size is due , not chiefly to maladministration , but rather to the demands made upon the city by all classes of citizens . Municipal frugality is needed , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , but on the part of the whole people . Finally , ecommomical and efficient administration , // and so cheaper and better service , is to be obtained through better executive officers and a better executive organization . The best man for mayor , who shall have the discretion and courage to select the best subordinates , and the executive ability to coordinate and organize the several departments of the city , is the thing most to be desired .
