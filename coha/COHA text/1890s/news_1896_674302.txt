txt That Tammany has made some sort of an alliance with the so-called organized labor vote was made clear last night , when its County Convention was held in the Wigwam and Jacob E. Bausch was nominated for Coroner , the only place on the county ticket this year . The convention convened at 8 o'clock , and was notable for a speech made by ex-Judge George M. Curtis , who has not been seen about Tammany Hall in several years . The leaders do not want to see hint again for several years more to come . The first twenty minutes of his speech was calm and pleasant enough , but after that he began to rant about President Cleveland and to score the men in Tammany who can not vote for Bryan but who want to stay in the organization , in a way to make the leaders turn pale . He also scolded the reporters present much after the fashion Ann O'Dea &; Dis Debar adopted . The character of this part of Mr. Curtis 's speech led John C. Sheehan to repudiate it afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speech was very good . Had Mr. Curtis stopped at that it would have been all right . But , when he seeks to attack newspaper men in a most unwarrantable , unjustifiable , and absolutely unnecessary way , I want to go on record as absolutely repudiating it in behalf of the organization . " Mr. Curtis 's attack on the President began in this way : " I saw down stairs tonight the portrait of a man who is now moldering with the dust , ( John Kelly , ) who once said of the present Executive , He is at heart a bad man , and if it becomes necessary he will betray his party . ' How true was that prophecy ? How clear that man 's forethought . " Praises the Chicago Platform . This was applauded by not more than a dozen men . Then Judge Curtis went on to denounce the Indianapolis ticket and to defend all the worst planks of the Chicago platform . After a period of comparatively quiet talk , he exclaimed : " What has this Government done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coudert . It was put in operation with a great flourish of trumpets when there was a chance of a third term . Do you- hear anything about it now ? - No , nor.you . wo n't hear anything about it . The policy of the present . Executive has been hostile to popular liberty , it has been hostile to the rights of citizens abroad , it has been in harmony with the oppression of mankind . Moderate applause . " Oh . I am not afraid to talk . Great applause . I am not afraid to place the greatest mental , moral , and political impostor of our history in the pillory where he belongs . I am not afraid to paint this ally of Great Britain in the colors he invites . " Renewed applause . By way of making all the harder for the present managers the job of keeping in Tammany next year men who can not stand repudiation , Judge Curtis said , among other things : " We admire those traitors who have marched boldly over to , but we despise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat must do one of two things in this fight . He must fight under the banner or go over to the enemy . We want no false friends or sexless traitors . " Curtis talked away so long that Chairman Goldfogle finally had to tell him to stop . He did so ten minutes later . It would not be kind to print all the things the leaders said of him afterward , but the responsibility for the most damaging speech of the year for Tammany is on their shoulders , as the Executive Committee selected Curtis to offer the resolutions , and it was in so doing that he made his speech . Proceedings of the Convention . The convention was conducted with as much ceremony as if a full county ticket was to be nominated . On motion of Chairman Martin of the Executive Committee , ex-Senator George W. Plunkitt was made temporary Chairman . When he said he had many favors front Tammany to be thankful for , there was a smile as broad as the ha/Z . After the usual convention routine a recess was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Civil Justice Goldfogle was made permanent Chairman , and ex-Judge Curtis offered the resolutions and made his speech . The resolutions declared enthusiastically for Bryan and Sewall , the State ticket , and silver ; condemned trusts , the third-ticket movement , - which was declared to be " bogus " ; condemned the Raines law and the Republican Legislature generally , and also condemned the present City Government in the usual fashion . The next business in order after the adoption of the resolutions was the nomination of a Coroner . Senator Samuel J. Foley put Mr. Bausch in nomination in a speech in which he had a great deal to say about young men and Bryan and Sewall . The candidates were cheered lustily . Mr. Bausch 's nomination was seconded by George Blair and Victor J. Dowling . They put stress on the linking of Tammany with labor . The nomination was made unanimously . Delegate of the Second District offered a resolution condemning the present city authorities for not providing sufficient school accommodations . This was adopted . The Candidate for Coroner . Mr. Bausch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " business agent of the Wood Carvers ' Union , " otherwise the walking delegate . His nomination was made on the recommendations of representatives of several labor unions . Most of the Tammany leaders first heard of his existence at the Executive Committee meeting in the afternoon . The districts were called at this meeting for the naming of candidates for Coroner . Mr. Sohmer of the Tenth nominated Henry W. Wolf ; Mr. Scully of the Twelfth named Mr. Bausch ; Mr. Keating of the Tenth , Jacob C. Wund ; Mr. Scannell of the Twera ty-fifth , former Coroner Louis W. Schultze ; E. C. Sheehy of the Thirtieth , Dr. Simon and Mr. Dinneen of the Second , by the full committee . He lives at 88 Cannon Street , was born in the Thirteenth Ward thirty years ago , and , according to his friends , has never lived anywhere else . His name , however , does not appear in the Directory . He is a wood carver , ex-President of the Building Trades Conference , exSecretary of the Board of Delegates of the Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Union and a professional labor man . Tammany leaders said yesterday that they had received contributions of $4,200 zince Tuesday night 's meeting .
