Note : 1Kb Main text Mrs. Willis Campbell 's Drawing-Room DR . LAWTON : Then truth , as I understand you , Mrs. Campbell , is a female virtue . MRS . CAMPBELL : It is one of them . DR . LAWTON : Oh ! You have several ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Legions , Dr. Lawton . DR . LAWTON : What do you do with them all ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , we just keep them . You may be sure we do n't waste them on men . What would be the use , for instance , of always telling Willis the truth ? He would n't believe it , to begin with . CAMPBELL : You had better try me once , Amy . My impression is that it 's the other thing I ca n't get away with . And yet I 'm a great deal more accustomed to it ! MRS . CAMPBELL : That is neither here nor there . But what I say , and what I insist , is that the conventional lies that people tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked , and altogether unnecessary . Why should I send word to the door that I 'm not at home , or that I 'm engaged , when I 'm not , merely to get out of seeing a person ? CAMPBELL : Because you are such a liar , my love . DR . LAWTON : No ! Excuse me , Campbell ! I do n't wish to intercept any little endearments , but really I think that in this case Mrs. Campbell 's sacrifice of the truth is a piece of altruism . She knows how it is herself ; she would n't like to be in the place of the person she wants to get out of seeing . So she sends word that she is not at home , or that she 's engaged . MRS . CAMPBELL : Of course I do . Willis 's idea of truth would be to send word that he did n't want to see them . DR . LAWTON , laughing : I have n't the least doubt of it . CAMPBELL : Well , you hoary-headed impostor , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have none ! I have been a general practitioner for forty years . But what time did you ask me for , Mrs. Campbell ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Seven . I do n't see what 's keeping them all . CAMPBELL : The women are not coming . MRS . CAMPBELL : Why ? CAMPBELL : Because they said they were . Truth is a female virtue . MRS . CAMPBELL : I must say , I do n't see why they 're so late . I ca n't understand , when every woman knows the anxiety of a hostess , how any one can be late . It 's very heartless , I think . Mrs. Campbell is in dinner dress ; she remains tranquilly seated on the sofa while she speaks , but the movement of her alternately folded and expanded fan betrays the agitation of her spirits . Dr. Lawton , lounging at large ease in a low chair , regards her with a mixture of admiration and scientific interest . Her husband walks up and down with a surcharge of nervous energy which the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little late . CAMPBELL : They will probably come in a lump  --  if they come at all . Do n't be discouraged , Amy . If they do n't come , I shall be hungry enough , by-and-by , to eat the whole dinner myself . MRS . CAMPBELL : That is a man 's idea ; you think that the great thing about a dinner is to get it eaten . DR . LAWTON : Oh , not all of us , Mrs. Campbell ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Well , I will except you , Dr. Lawton . CAMPBELL : And what is a woman 's idea of a dinner , I should like to know ? MRS . CAMPBELL : To get it over . CAMPBELL : In this instance , then , I think you 're going to fail . I see no prospect of your getting it over . The people are not coming . I guess you wrote Thursday when you meant Tuesday ; did n't you , Amy ? Your Tuesdays always look like Thursdays , anyway . MRS . CAMPBELL : Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well , what I want you to do is to tell them what you really think of them when they do come . I do n't want any hollow-hearted pretence that it is n't at all late , and that you did not expect them before , and all that kind of thing . You just say , Yes , you are rather behind time ; and , No , I did n't write half-past seven ; I wrote seven . With all your devotion to truth , I 'll bet you would n't dare to speak it once . MRS . CAMPBELL : What will you bet ? Come , now ! Dr. Lawton will hold the stakes . CAMPBELL : Ah , I should have to pay , whichever lost , and Lawton would pocket the stakes . DR . LAWTON : Try me ! CAMPBELL : I 'd rather not . It would be too expensive . ( A ring is heard ; and then voices below and on the stairs . ) The spell is broken ! I hear the stentorian tones of my sister Agnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and now they 'll all come . ( She runs out to the space at the top of the stairs which forms a sort of passageway between the drawing-room and library . ) Oh , Agnes ! I 'm so glad to see you ! And Mr. Roberts ! She says this without , and the shock of kisses penetrates to the drawing-room , where Campbell and Dr. Lawton remain . MRS . ROBERTS , without : Amy , I 'm quite ashamed of myself ! I 'm afraid we 're late . I think Edward 's watch must be slow . MRS . CAMPBELL , without : Not at all ! I do n't believe it 's seven yet . I 've only just got into my gown . CAMPBELL : It is a female virtue , Doctor ! DR . LAWTON : Oh , there 's no doubt of its sex . MRS . CAMPBELL , without : You 'll find Willis in the drawing-room with Dr. Lawton , Mr. Roberts . CAMPBELL , as Roberts meekly appears : Hello , Roberts ! You 're late , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . ROBERTS : No , I 'm afraid it 's my fault . How do you do , Dr. Lawton ? I think my watch is losing time . CAMPBELL : You did n't come your old dodge of stealing a garroter 's watch on your way through the Common ? Footnote : 1Kb That was a tremendous exploit of yours , Roberts . DR . LAWTON : And you were at your best that night , Campbell . For a little while I was n't sure but truth was a boy . CAMPBELL : I do n't believe old Bemis has quite forgiven Roberts to this day . By-the-way , Bemis is late , too . Would n't have helped much to grab his watch to-night , Roberts . Hold on ! That 's his voice , now ! ( As Mr. Bemis enters ) Good-evening , Mr. Bemis . Roberts and I were just talking of that night when you tried to garrot him in the Common , and he got away with your watch . MR . BEMIS , reluctantly : Oh ! very good . Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ha , ha ! Capital ! MR . BEMIS : Talking of watches , I hope I 'm not late . CAMPBELL : About half an hour . MRS . CAMPBELL , re-entering and giving her hand : Do n't believe a word of it , Mr. Bemis . You 're just in time . Why , even Aunt Mary is not here yet ! AUNT MARY CRASHAW , without : Yes , I am , my dear  --  half-way up your ridiculous stairs . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , Aunt Mary ! She runs out to meet her . CAMPBELL , to Dr. Lawton : You see ! she ca n't tell the truth even by accident . ROBERTS : What in the world do you mean , Willis ? CAMPBELL : ' Sh ! It 's a bet . ( To Mrs. Crashaw , coming in with his wife ) You are pretty well blown , Aunt Mary . MRS . CRASHAW : Blown ? I wonder I 'm alive to reproach Amy for these stairs . Why do n't you live in a flat ? CAMPBELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you can get stuck in it . Footnote : 1Kb MRS . CRASHAW : I dare say I shall , if you put it in . What a frightful experience ! I shall never forget that night . How d'ye do , Edward ? ( She shakes hands with Roberts and Mr. Bemis . ) How do you do , Mr. Bemis ? I know how Dr. Lawton does , without asking . DR . LAWTON , gallantly : All the better for  --  MRS . CRASHAW : Do n't say , for seeing me ! We may be chestnuts , doctor , but we need n't speak them . ( To Mrs. Campbell ) Are you going to have the whole elevator company , as usual ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes  --  all but Mr. and Mrs. Miller . I asked them , but they had an engagement . MRS . CRASHAW : So much the worse for them . Mrs. Curwen will be very much disappointed not to see  --  Mrs. Miller . ( The men laugh . She shakes her fan at them . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things . Well , now , since I 'm here , I wish the others would come . I 'm rather hungry , and it 's late , is n't it ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Not at all ! I do n't see why you all think it 's late . I 'm sure it 's very early . Ah , Mrs. Curwen ! ( She advances upon this lady , who enters with her husband behind her . ) So glad you could come . And Mr. Curwen ! I did n't hear you coming ! MRS . CURWEN : That proves you did n't eavesdrop at the head of the stairs , my dear . We were quarrelling all the way up to this threshold . After I 'd answered it , I mislaid your invitation , and Mr. Curwen was sure we were asked for Wednesday . But I knew better . As it is , I 'm afraid we 're rather late . MRS . CAMPBELL , forcing a laugh : We rarely sit down before eight . Oh , Mrs. Bemis ! How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Bemis with effusion , as they come in with an air of haste . MRS . BEMIS : Oh , I know we 're frightfully late ! BEMIS : Yes , it 's quite shocking  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Not at all ! Really , I think it must be a conspiracy . Everybody says they are late , and I do n't know why . CAMPBELL : I do ; but I do n't like to tell . DR . LAWTON : Much safer , my dear boy ! Much ! MRS . CAMPBELL , ignoring this passage : If I should make you wait , just to show you that it was early , I do n't think it would be more than you deserve . CAMPBELL : Probably , if you did that , Miss Reynolds would get here too soon . MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes ; and she 's usually so prompt . MRS . CURWEN : I 'm beginning to have the courage of my convictions , Mrs. Campbell . Are you sure you did n't say half-past ? MRS . CAMPBELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely I may have done so in your note . But I do n't see why we are so inflexible about dinner engagements . I think we ought to give people at least three-quarters of an hour 's grace , instead of that wretched fifteen minutes that keeps everybody 's heart in their mouth . ( The door-bell sounds . ) Ah ! That 's Miss Reynold 's ring , and  --  CAMPBELL : We are saved ! I was afraid we were going to be thirteen at table . MRS . ROBERTS : Thirteen ! What do you mean , Willis ? CAMPBELL : Why , one from twelve , you know . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , yes . The others laugh . MRS . CAMPBELL : Do n't notice him , Agnes . He 's in one of his very worst ways to-night . MRS . ROBERTS : But I do n't see what the joke is ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Neither do I , Agnes . I  --  A GHOSTLY VOICE , as of an asthmatic spectre speaking through an imperfectly attached set of artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed to earth will rise again .

THE VOICE : This is the North America Company 's perfected phonograph , invented by Thomas A.  --  cr  --  cr  --  cr  --  ee  --  ee  --  ck  --  ck  --  ck  --  New Jersey . This cylinder was  --  cr  --  cr  --  elocutionist  --  ee  --  ee  --  ck  --  Cullen Bryant  --  Truth crushed to  --  cr  --  cr  --  ck  --  ck  --  CAMPBELL : Do n't be alarmed , Aunt Mary . It 's just a phonograph that I had got in to amuse you after dinner . It do n't seem to be exactly in order . Perhaps the cylinder 's got dry , or Jim has n't got quite the right pressure on  --  MRS . CRASHAW : Is Jim in there ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , and Jim has been angelic the whole afternoon . MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , you 're too good , Amy ! MRS . CRASHAW : I do n't wonder he 's been angelic , with a thing like that to play with . I should be angelic myself . Why ca n't we go and be amused with it a little before dinner , Willis ? THE OTHERS , respectively : Oh , yes . Do . By all means . I never heard one before . We really ca n't wait . Let us hear it now , Mr. Campbell ! Do make him , Mrs. Campbell . CAMPBELL : Well , all right . I 'll go with you  --  ( He stops , feeling himself significantly clutched by the wrist , and arrested in mid-career , by Mrs. Campbell . ) Or , Jim can show it off . It 'll do him so much good . I 'll let Jim . ( The guests follow one another out with cries of real and simulated interest , and Campbell turns to his wife . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAMPBELL : What is it ? I shall die , Willis ! CAMPBELL : Well , speak first . MRS . CAMPBELL : Something 's happened to the dinner , I know . And I 'm afraid to go and see . The cook 's so cross ! CAMPBELL : Well , shall I go ? MRS . CAMPBELL : And if you keep up this teasing of yours , you 'll simply kill me . CAMPBELL : Well , I wo n't , then . But it 's very lucky your guests are belated too , Amy . Now , if you could get the dinner on in about ten minutes , we should be just right . But you 've told them all they were so early that they 'll believe the delay is all yours . MRS . CAMPBELL : They wo n't believe anything of the kind ! They know better . But I do n't dare  --  JANE , the waitress , appearing through the portire of the drawing-room : Dinner is ready , Mrs. Campbell . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget , it 's young Mrs. Bemis you 're to take down  --  not Mrs. Curwen . CAMPBELL : Oh , no ! I sha' n't forget that . I hope Mrs. Curwen wo n't . Hello ! There 's another ring . Who in the world is that ? MRS . CAMPBELL : ' Sh ! If that horrid , squeaking phonograph  --  THE PHONOGRAPH , from the library : Truth crushed to earth will  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Good gracious ! I ca n't hear a word . Hark ! It 's Miss Reynolds talking with some one in the reception-room , and it sounds like  --  but it ca n't be  --  no , it ca n't  --  it  --  it is  --  yes ! And that 's his voice too , Willis ! What does it mean ? Am I losing my five senses ? Or am I simply going stark , staring mad ? CAMPBELL : You do n't say the Millers have come ? MRS . CAMPBELL : The Millers ? No ! Who cares anything about the Millers ? ' Sh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Belforts ! MRS . CAMPBELL : How can you dare to say it , Willis ? Of course it 's the Belforts . Hark ! She listens . CAMPBELL , listening : But I thought you said they declined , too . MRS . CAMPBELL : They did . It 's some frightful mystery . Be still , do , Willis ! CAMPBELL : Why , I 'm not making any noise . It 's the froufrou of that dress of yours . MRS . CAMPBELL : It 's your shirt bosom . You always will have them so stiff ; and you keep breathing so . CAMPBELL : Oh , well , if you do n't want me to breathe ! MRS . CAMPBELL , desperately : It does n't matter . It would n't help now if you never breathed again . Do n't joke , Willis ! I ca n't bear it . If you do , I shall scream . CAMPBELL : I was n't going to joke . It 's too serious . What are you going to do ? MRS . CAMPBELL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them from finding out that they were n't expected . CAMPBELL : But how do you suppose it 's happened , Amy ? MRS . CAMPBELL : I do n't know . They meant to decline somewhere else and accept here , and they mixed the letters . It 's always happening . But be still now ! They 're coming up , and all we can do is to keep them in the dark as well as we can . You must help me , Willis . CAMPBELL : Oh , there 's nothing I like better than throwing dust in people 's eyes . It 's my native element . MRS . CAMPBELL : Of course it puts the table all out , and we 've got to rearrange the places , and think who is going to take out who again as soon as we can get rid of them . Be making up some pretext , Willis . We 've got to consult together , or else we are completely lost . You 'll have to stay and keep talking , while I run down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe there 's room enough now , and I 'm not certain about the quails . The cook said she did n't believe they were all nice . How can people be so careless about notes ! I think it 's really criminal . There ought to be something done about it . If people wo n't read their notes over they ought to be told about it , and I 've the greatest mind to say at once that they sent a refusal , and I was n't expecting them . It would serve them right . CAMPBELL : Yes , and it would be such a relief to your feelings . I wish you would do it , Amy . Just for once . MRS . CAMPBELL : I shall have to take the tablecloth off if I put another leaf in , and the whole thing has got to be rearranged , decorations and everything ; and I 'd got the violets scattered so carelessly . Now I shall just fling them on . I do n't care how they look . I 'm completely discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone . CAMPBELL : Like a precious stone . You are such a perfect little brick , Amy . MRS . CAMPBELL : I guess you would n't like it yourself , Willis . And the Belforts are just the people I should have liked to do my best before , and now their being here spoils everything . CAMPBELL , smiling : It is a complication ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , yes , giggle , do ! I suppose you 'd expect me to be logical , as you call it , with my dying breath . CAMPBELL : No , I should n't , Amy ; but I know you 'd be delightful under any circumstances . You always get there just the same , whether you take the steps or not . But brace up now , dear , and you 'll come out all right . Tell them the truth and I 'll stand by you . I do n't want any better fun . He slips behind his wife , who gives him a ghastly glance over her shoulder as the Belforts enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , how do you do , Maria ? ( She kisses Miss Reynolds , and then , with gay cordiality , gives her hand to Mrs. Belfort . ) I 'm so glad to see you ! ( She shakes hands with Belfort . ) So kind of you to come . MISS REYNOLDS : I 'm sorry to be a little late , Amy ; but better late than never , I suppose . MRS . BELFORT : I 'm not so sure of that . Dear Mrs. Campbell ! I wish you would be quite frank with me ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Late ? Frank ? What do you mean , both of you ? You know you 're never late , Maria ; and why should I be frank with you , Mrs. Belfort ? CAMPBELL : What do you take us for ? MRS . BELFORT , holding Mrs. Campbell 's hand clasped between both of hers : For the very nicest and kindest people in the world , who would n't let me have the mortification of deranging them on any account . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expect you ? What a strange question ! Why in the world should n't we expect you ? CAMPBELL : What an extraordinary idea ! MRS . BELFORT : Because I had to hurry away from Mrs. Miller 's tea when I went home to dress , and when I told her we were coming here to dinner , she said , " Oh , you are going , then ? " in such a way that , though she covered it up afterwards , and said she did n't mean anything , and she did n't know why she had spoken , I felt sure there must be some misunderstanding , and I 've come quite ready to be sent away again if there is . Did n't you get my note ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Your note ? Why , of course I did ! MRS . BELFORT : Then it 's all right . Such a relief ! Now I feel that I can breathe freely again . MR . BELFORT : I assure you , Mrs. Campbell , it 's a relief to me , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many minds as she 's been for the last hour and a half . She was quite encyclopedic . CAMPBELL : Oh , I know how that is , my dear boy . I 've known Mrs. Campbell change hers as often as an unabridged dictionary in great emergencies . MRS . BELFORT : But really , the only thing for us to do was to come , as I felt from the beginning , in spite of my doubts what to do . I thought I could depend upon you to send us away if we were n't wanted ; but if we were , and did n't come , you could n't very well have sent for us . MRS . CAMPBELL , gayly : Indeed I should ! CAMPBELL , gallantly : The dinner would have been nothing without you . MRS . BELFORT : I do n't know about that , but I 'm sure we should have been nothing without the dinner . We were so glad to come . I waited a little while about answering , till I could see whether we could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over us . Even after we got here , though , I 'd half a mind to run away , and we 've been catechising poor Miss Reynolds down in the reception-room till she would n't stand it any longer , and so here we are . MRS . CAMPBELL : And I 'm perfectly delighted . If you had yielded to any such ridiculous misgiving , I should never have forgiven you . I 'm sure I do n't know what Mrs. Miller could have  --  THE PHONOGRAPH , in the library : Truth crushed to earth will cr  --  cr-r-r-r  --  ck  --  ck  --  cr  --  MRS . BELFORT : A phonograph ! Oh , have you got one ? I must hear it ! CAMPBELL : Well , wo n't you come into the library ? My nephew is in there , driving everybody mad with it . He 'll be perfectly delighted with a fresh victim . MRS . BELFORT : And I shall be charmed to offer myself up . Come , Miss Reynolds . Come , Roger . CAMPBELL : Yes , come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then adroitly slips back to his wife , who has abandoned herself wildly upon the sofa . MRS . CAMPBELL : Well , now , what are you going to do , Willis ? CAMPBELL : I 'm not going to do anything . I have n't been flying in the face of Providence . If ever there was a woman offered a clean and safe way out ! But since you preferred to remain in this labyrinth  --  this Black Forest of improbabilities  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , do n't torment me , Willis ! Do n't you see that her taking it that way made it all the more impossible for me to tell her of the blunder she had committed ? I simply could n't do it , then . CAMPBELL : I do n't see how you could help doing it , then . MRS . CAMPBELL : When she behaved so magnanimously about it , and put herself in my power ? I would sooner have died , and she knew it perfectly well . That 's the reason she was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But it 's no use talking about that now . We 've got to do something , and you 've got to think what we shall do . Now think ! CAMPBELL : What about ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , do n't tease , dearest ! About the trouble  --  and who shall take out who  --  and the quails . You know what ! CAMPBELL : Well , I think if we leave those people alone much longer , they 'll all come out here and ask if they were n't mistaken in supposing they were expected . MRS . CAMPBELL , whimpering : Oh , there you go ! How perfectly heartless ! MRS . ROBERTS , showing herself at the door : Amy , dear , what is the matter ? Did n't you tell me the Belforts were not coming ? Is that what 's keeping you out here ? I just knew it was ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes , Agnes ; but do go back to them , and keep them amused . Willis and I are trying to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole table , you know , and I 'm not sure whether there 'll be quails enough to go round . MRS . ROBERTS : Do n't worry about that , Amy . I wo n't take any , and I 'll give Edward a hint about them . CAMPBELL : And Roberts is capable of asking you before the whole company why you do n't want him to take quail . There 's nothing like Roberts for presence of mind and any little bit of finesse like that . No , it wo n't do for the entire connection to fight shy of quail . Mrs. Belfort has got her suspicions roused , and she 'd be on to a thing of that kind like lightning . She 's got the notion that she was n't expected , somehow , and she 's been making it hot for Amy  --  trying to get her to own up , and all that . If it had n't been for me , Amy would have owned up , too . But I kept my eye on her , and she lied out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It is n't so , Agnes . He wanted me to tell the truth about it , as he calls it  --  MRS . ROBERTS : What an idea ! You might as well have died at once . I do n't see what you could have been thinking of , Willis ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes , he ca n't understand yet why I should n't , when Mrs. Belfort asked me if there was n't some mistake , and literally threw herself on my mercy . She had no business to do it , and I shall always think it was taking a mean advantage ; but I was n't going to let myself be outdone in magnanimity . I should n't have thought she would be capable of it . MRS . ROBERTS : It was n't very nice , but I suppose she was excited . We must n't blame her , and you did the only thing that any human creature could do . I 'm surprised at Willis ; or , rather , I 'm not surprised . CAMPBELL : Well , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Agnes . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , yes ; do go back to them , Agnes , dear ! I have got to arrange all over again now , about who 's to go out with who , you know . I shall want you to let Edward take Mrs. Curwen , and  --  MRS . ROBERTS : Oh , Amy , you know I 'd do anything for you , especially in a case like this ; but I ca n't let Edward take Mrs. Curwen out . I do n't mind her flirting ; she does that with every one ; but she always gets Edward to laughing so that it attracts the attention of the whole table , and  --  CAMPBELL : That 's a very insignificant matter . I 'll take out Mrs. Curwen , myself  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : No , indeed you wo n't ! You always get her laughing , and that 's a great deal worse . CAMPBELL : Well , well , I wo n't , then . But we can arrange that afterwards . MRS . CAMPBELL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ; and I do n't want you to go near Mrs. Curwen . She 'll be sure to see that there 's something wrong from the delay , and she 'll try to find it out , and if she should I shall simply perish on the spot . She 'll try to get round you and make you tell , and I want you to promise me , Willis , on your bended knees , that you wo n't let it out . She 's insufferable enough as it is , but if she got to sympathizing with me , or patronizing me about such a thing , as she 'd be sure to do , I do n't know what I should do . Will you promise ? CAMPBELL : Oh , I promise . Look out you do n't tell her yourself , Amy ! But now I 've got to see that there 's enough to eat , under this new deal , and the great question is about the quail , and I 've thought how to manage that . I 'll just run down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We can have them here inside of a half-hour , and never turn a feather . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , Willis , you are inspired . Well , I shall always say that when there is any real thinking to be done  --  But hurry back , do , dear , and Agnes and I will be trying to settle who shall take out  --  Oh , I 'm afraid you wo n't get back in time to help us ! It takes so long to telephone the simplest thing . CAMPBELL : I 'll be back in one-quarter of a second . He rushes out , brushing by Mrs. Crashaw , who enters at the same moment from the library . MRS . CRASHAW : Amy , child , what in the world has happened ? What are you staying out here away from your company for ? Where 's Willis going ? What 's Agnes doing here ? It 's perfectly scandalous to leave all those people alone ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , Aunt Mary , if you only knew , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come ? MRS . CRASHAW : Yes , of course they 've come , and after they declined ; I understand that . But it 's only a matter of two plates more at the table  --  MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , is it ? And am I to let him go down with her ? The whole affair has got to be planned over , and another leaf put in , and the table rearranged , and I do n't know what all . MRS . ROBERTS : And Willis has gone down to telephone to the club for more quails . MRS . CRASHAW , to MRS . CAMPBELL : You do n't mean that you only got just quails enough ? MRS . CAMPBELL , indignantly : A dinner for ten is not a dinner for twelve . I may not have kept house so long as you , Aunt Mary , but I 'm not quite a child ! ( At this critical moment Campbell returns . ) Well , will they send them ? CAMPBELL : Yes , yes . It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Central was busy ; but I 've primed Green 's man , down below , and he 'll call them up in a minute . He understands it . I thought I 'd hurry back and see if I could be of use . Well , have you got things all straight ? MRS . CRASHAW : No ; we 've spent the time in getting them crookeder , if possible . I 've insinuated that Amy did n't know how to order her dinner , and she 's told me I 'm an old woman . I am an old woman , Amy , and you must n't regard me . I think my mind 's going . She kisses Mrs. Campbell , who clasps her in a forgiving embrace . MRS . CAMPBELL : Mine 's gone , Aunt Mary , or I never could have taken anything amiss from you ! I do n't see how I shall live through it . I do n't know what to do ; it seems to get worse every moment . MRS . CRASHAW : Why , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAMPBELL : That 's the worst of it . I thought I ought to let the Millers know who had failed when I asked them so late ; and the Belforts were there at tea this afternoon , and Mrs. Miller let out her surprise that they were coming . So , of course , I had a double duty . CAMPBELL : But , thank goodness , she was equal to it , Aunt Mary . I 've had to do some tall lying in my time , but I never soared to the heights that Amy reached with the Belforts , in my palmiest days . MRS . CRASHAW : Well , then , if she convinced them that their supicions were wrong , it 's all right ; and if the quails are coming from the club , I do n't see what there is to worry about . We must be thankful that you could get out of it so easily . MRS . CAMPBELL : But we 're not out of it . The table has to be rearranged , but I can have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quails . The great thing is to manage about the going out . It happens very fortunately that if I tell all the other men whom they 're to take out , Mr. Belfort ca n't suppose that he was an after-thought . But I ca n't seem to make a start with a new arrangement , in my own mind . CAMPBELL : You 've used up all your invention in convincing the Belforts that they were expected . Good gracious , here 's Dr. Lawton ! What do you want here , you venerable opprobrium of science ? DR . LAWTON , standing at ease on the threshold of the drawing-room : Nothing . I merely got tired of hearing the praises of truth chanted in there , and came out here for  --  a little change . CAMPBELL : Well , you ca n't stay . You 've got to go back , and help keep the Belforts from supposing they were n't expected , if it takes all your hoarded wisdom as a general practitioner for forty years . MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh yes ; do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the treatment up to the present time ? CAMPBELL : The most heroic kind . Amy has spared neither age nor sex , in the use of whoppers . You know what she is , doctor , when she has a duty to perform . DR . LAWTON : But whoppers , as I understand , are always of one sex . They may be old ; they often are , I believe ; but they are invariably masculine . CAMPBELL : Oh , that does n't prevent women 's using them . They use all of us . DR . LAWTON : Well , then , there 's no need of my going back on that account . In fact , I may congratulate Mrs. Campbell on the most complete success . The Belforts are thoroughly deceived . MRS . CAMPBELL , with tremulous eagerness : Oh , do you think so , doctor ? If I could only believe that , how happy I should be ! DR . LAWTON : You may be sure of it , Mrs. Campbell . Belfort does n't count , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men will believe anything that 's told them . DR . LAWTON : And I do n't allude to him . But Mrs. Belfort got me to one side as soon as she saw me , and told me she had been afraid there was something wrong , but Mrs. Campbell had assured her that she had got her note of acceptance , and now she was going to give her whole mind to the phonograph 's beautiful rendering of Bryant 's poem on truth . MRS . ROBERTS : There , Amy , you see there 's no reason to worry about that ! MRS . CRASHAW : No ; the only thing now is to get your dinner on the table , child , and let us eat it as soon as possible . CAMPBELL : Yes , if Lawton 's telling the truth . THE LADIES : Willis ! DR . LAWTON : Do n't mind him , ladies ! The experiences of his early life in California , you know , must have been very unfavorable to a habit of confidence in his fellow-men . I pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BEMIS : Dr. Lawton , I wish you would go and bring your daughter here . She 's flirting outrageously with my husband . In making this accusation , Mrs. Curwen casts the eye of experienced coquetry at young Mr. Bemis , who laughs foolishly . DR . LAWTON : Oh , I dare say he wo n't mind ; he must be so used to it . MRS . CURWEN : What do you mean , Dr. Lawton ? What does he mean , Mr. Campbell ? CAMPBELL : I could n't imagine , for the life of me . MRS . CURWEN : Can you tell , Mrs. Campbell ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , I never tell  --  such things . MRS . CURWEN : What mysteries ! Well , can you tell me what makes Mrs. Belfort so uncommonly gay , this evening ? She seems to be in the greatest spirits , laughing with everybody  --  Mr. Bemis pre , and Mr. Roberts . MRS . CAMPBELL : Mrs. Belfort ? MRS . CURWEN : Yes . She seems a little hysterical . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping the circle of her confidants with a look of misery : What could have happened ? DR . LAWTON : It 's merely the pleasure of finding herself in your company , Mrs. Curwen . MRS . CURWEN : Oh , thank you , Dr. Lawton . I know that I scatter sunshine in my path , but not to that extent , I think . ( With winning appeal ) Oh , what is the cat in the meal , doctor ? ( To young Mr. Bemis , archly ) Do make them tell me , Mr. Bemis ! YOUNG MR . BEMIS , with the air of epigram : I 'm sure I do n't know . He chokes with flattered laughter . MRS . CURWEN : How cruel of you not even to try ! ( She makes eyes at young Mr. Bemis , and then transfers them rapidly to Campbell . ) Wo n't you just whisper it in my ear , Mr. Campbell ? Mrs. Roberts , you ca n't imagine what nice things your husband 's been saying to me ! I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's devoting himself to Mrs. Belfort . Perhaps it was that made her so lively . He began at once . He 's so amusing . I envy you having such a husband always about . YOUNG MR . BEMIS , in the belief that he is saying something gallant : I 'm sure we 're none of us so hard-hearted as to envy you , Mrs. Curwen . MRS . CURWEN : Oh , thank you , Mr. Bemis ! I shall really be afraid to tell Mr. Curwen all you say . ( She laughs , and Campbell joins her , even under the reproachful gaze of his wife and sister . Mrs. Curwen turns coaxingly to him . ) Do tell ! CAMPBELL : Tell what ? MRS . CURWEN : Well  --  ( She pauses thoughtfully , and then suddenly adds . ) Who 's going to take me out to dinner ? MRS . CAMPBELL , surprised into saying it : Why , it 's all disarranged now by the Belforts  --  She stops , and a thrill of dismay at her self-betrayal makes itself apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands : Do n't say by the Belforts coming unexpectedly ! Oh , dear Mrs. Campbell , I know how to pity you ! That very thing happened to me last winter . Only , it was Mrs. Miller who came after she 'd declined ; she said Mr. Miller would n't come without her . But why do you mind it ? We all went out pell-mell . Such fun ! But it must have taken all Mr. Campbell 's ingenuity to keep them from suspecting . CAMPBELL : More , too . I was nowhere . MRS . CURWEN , with caressing deference to Mrs. Campbell : Of course you were not needed . But is n't it shocking how one has to manage in such an emergency ? I really believe it would be better to tell the truth sometimes . Do n't you ? MRS . CAMPBELL : It 's all very well telling the truth if they do n't suspect anything . But when people tax you with their mistakes , and try to make you own up that they 've blundered , then of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You simply have to . MRS . CRASHAW : There 's no other way , in that case , even if you 'd prefer to tell the truth . MRS . CURWEN : Oh , in that case , yes , indeed . Poor Mrs. Campbell ! I can imagine how annoying it must have been ; but I should have liked to hear you getting out of it ! What did you say ? I 'm so transparent , people see through me at once . CAMPBELL : Are you ? DR . LAWTON : Do n't you think you 're a little hard on yourself , Mrs. Curwen ? MRS . CURWEN , with burlesque meekness and sincerity : No , not the least . It 's simple justice . ( Mr. Curwen enters with Roberts . ) You can ask my husband if you do n't believe me . Or no , I 'll put the case to him myself . Fred , dear , if people whom I did n't expect to dinner , came , could I keep them from discovering that they were n't expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  little fibs , and all that ? CURWEN : Well , I do n't know  --  MRS . CURWEN , shaking her fan at him during the general laugh : Oh , what a wicked husband ! You do n't believe I could fib out of such a thing , do you , Mr. Roberts ? ROBERTS , gallantly : If I knew what the thing was ? MRS . CURWEN : Why , like the Belforts  --  Oh , poor Mrs. Campbell ! I did n't mean to let it out ! MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , it does n't matter . Would you like to go and tell the Belforts themselves ? Or , you need n't go : they 're coming here . MRS . BELFORT , returning from the library , followed by her husband and the elder Mr. Bemis : How perfectly the phonograph renders that piece , Mr. Campbell ! I 've never heard anything like it . CAMPBELL : It 's all in practice . You would n't hear anything else here , Mrs. Belfort . It 's my favorite poem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as much as I do . MRS . CURWEN : I adore it ! THE PHONOGRAPH , within : Truth crushed to earth will rise again . CAMPBELL : Every time ! But I wish Jim would change the cylinder . I like a little vari  --  A SOUND , from the regions below , something like : Woor , roor , roor ; woor , roor , roor ! and then a voice : Hello ! Is that you , Central ? Well , give me two hundred and forty-one , please ! Yes , two , four , one : Iroquois Club . Footnote : 1Kb Yes ! What ? Yes , Iroquois Club  --  two forty-one . Well , hurry up ! Is that you , Iroquois ? Yes ? Busy ? Well , that wo n't work . I do n't care if you are busy . You 've got to take my message , and take it right away . Hear that ? CAMPBELL : Hear it ? I should think they could ! That confounded fool has left the closet-door open ! He rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various attitudes of sympathy and dismay , and Mrs. Curwen bows herself into her fan , and the voice below continues . THE VOICE : Well , why do n't you send them quails you promised half an hour ago ? What ? Who is it ? It 's Mr. Campbell . C , a , m , Cam , m , e , l , mel , Campbell . One hump ! What ? Oh , hump yourself ! It 's Mr. Cam  --  CAMPBELL 'S VOICE , from below : Why the deuce do n't you shut that closet-door ? Shut it ! Shut it ! We can hear you all over the house , the way you yell . Do n't you know how to use a telephone ? Shut that door , anyway ! THE VOICE : Oh , I beg your pardon , sir , I did n't think about the door . I did n't know it was open . All right , sir . ( There is the sound of a closing door , and then , as Campbell rejoins his guests with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . ) Iroquois ! Is this Iroquois ? No , I do n't want you ; I want Iroquois . Well , is that Iroquois now ? ( The words are at first muffled ; then they grow more and more distinct , in spite of the intervening door . ) Yes , quails ! A dozen roast quails . You got the order half an hour ago . There 's a lot of folks come that they did n't expect , and they got to have some more birds . Well , hurry up , then ! Good-by ! Woor-roor ! CAMPBELL , amid the consternation of the company , while Mrs. Belfort fixes his wife with an eye of mute reproach : Now , my dear , this is so awful that nothing can be done about it on the old lines . MRS . CAMPBELL : Yes ; I give it up . Mrs. Belfort , I tried my very best to keep you from suspecting , and even when you did suspect , I 'm sure you must say that I did all I could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , poor Mrs. Campbell ! Must you own up ? MRS . BELFORT : But I do n't understand . You got my note of acceptance , did n't you ? MRS . CAMPBELL : But it was n't a note of acceptance : it was a note of regret ! MRS . BELFORT : Indeed it was not ! MRS . CAMPBELL : I knew just how it had happened as soon as I saw you this evening , and I determined that wild horses should not get the truth out of me . ( Campbell and Dr. Lawton exchange signals of admiration . ) You must have been writing two notes , declining somewhere else , and then got them mixed . It 's always happening . CAMPBELL : It 's one of the commonest things in the world  --  on the stage ; and ever since a case of the kind happened to Mrs. Campbell down at the Shore , Footnote : 1Kb one summer , she 's known how to deal with it . MRS . BELFORT : But I did n't write two notes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Mrs. Campbell how very glad I was to come . Do you happen to have kept my note ? MRS . CAMPBELL : They are all here in this desk , and  --  ( running to it , and pulling it open ) here is yours . ( She reads . ) " Dear Mrs. Campbell , I am very sorry to be so late in answering . An out-of-town engagement for the tenth , which has been hanging over us in a threatening way for the past fortnight  --  " Mrs. Campbell turns the leaf , and continues reading in a murmur that finally fades into the silence of utter dismay . CAMPBELL : Well , my dear ? MRS . CRASHAW : What in the world is it , child ? MRS . ROBERTS : Amy ! MRS . CURWEN : Oh , not another mystery , I hope ! CAMPBELL : Go on , Amy , or shall I  --  MRS . CAMPBELL , reading desperately on : "  --  for the past fortnight , is happily off at last , and I am very glad indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , for Mr. Belfort and myself  --  " She lets her hands , with the letter stretched between them , fall dramatically before her . CAMPBELL : Well , my dear , there seems to be a pretty clear case against you , and unless you can plead mind-transference , or something like that  --  MRS . ROBERTS : I 'm sure it 's mind-transference , Amy ! I 've often been through the same experience myself . Just take the opposite of what 's said . MRS . CAMPBELL , in a daze : But I do n't see  --  Yes , now I begin to remember how it must have been  --  how it was . I know now , but I do n't know how I can ever forgive myself for such carelessness , when I 'm always so particular about notes  --  CAMPBELL : Yes , I 've even heard you say it was criminal to read them carelessly . I can bear witness for you there . MRS . ROBERTS : I 'm sure I could too , Amy , in a court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going out when your note came , Mrs. Belfort , and I read the first page  --  down to " for the past fortnight "  --  and I took it for granted that the opening regret meant a refusal , and just dropped it into my desk and gave you up . It 's inexcusable , perfectly inexcusable ! I 'm quite at your feet , Mrs. Belfort , and I shall not blame you at all if you ca n't forgive me . What shall I say to you ? MRS . BELFORT , amiably : Nothing , my dear , except that you will let me stay , now I 'm here ! MRS . CAMPBELL : How sweet you are ! You shall live with us ! CAMPBELL : Truth crushed to earth ! It 's perfectly wonderful ! Mrs. Campbell ca n't get away from it when she tries her best . She tells it in spite of herself . She supposed she was n't telling it when she said there was no mistake on your part ; but she was . Well , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unquestionably , I think that it came into the world with woman . MRS . CAMPBELL , with mounting courage : Yes a pretty predicament I should have been in , Willis , if I had taken your advice , and told the truth , as you call it , in the beginning . But now we wo n't wait any longer . The quails will come in their own good time . My dear , will you give Mrs. Belfort your arm ? And , Mr. Belfort , will you give me yours ? MRS . CURWEN : And all the rest of us ? MRS . CAMPBELL : Oh , you can come out pell-mell . MRS . CURWEN : Oh , dear Mrs. Campbell ! Back matter THE END
