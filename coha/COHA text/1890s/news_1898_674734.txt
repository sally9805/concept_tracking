txt It is a natural instinct of American citizens to sympathize with the Cubans in their struggle to establish a government with the consent of the governed . But the United States Senators who have been advocating the cause of the Cubans and trying at the same time to force a government upon the Hawaiians without their consent and against their protest must find a new plea of necessity for their pitiable inconsistency if they persist in the plan of annexing by resolution . Since it has become obvious to everybody that the ownership of the Sandwich Islands or any other populated islands , distant from our coast , would be a source of weakness , to the Government in case of war , ( just as Cuba . and the Philippine Islands would be to Spain , ) it is difficult to imagine what new plea Of necessity can be presented to the House of Representatives that would induce a majority of its members to stultify themselves as a majority of Senators have done . But , aside from the question of stultification , the resolutions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the House or Senate to support them , at the present juncture , without subordinating the cause of National defense to that of annexation . The finger of scorn will be pointed at every member of Congress , regardless of his former standing in public estimation , who puts himself where people can say of him : " He voted for investing $4,000 , - 000 in the Hawaiian public debt when every dollar was needed for ships and guns . "
