txt ? * He was a warm and faithful party man so long as his party pursued objects which had the approval of his conscience . He broke with his party as soon as he became convinced that its conduct made it an engine of evil to the country . No conspicuous member of a political party can turn against his former associates without exposing himself to bitter censure and vituperation . This was also his lot . It seems to be difficult to the mind used to partisan ways of thinking to understand how a man may change his party allegiance in order to keep unchanged his principles and convictions of right . No doubt George William Curtis felt keenly the obloquy that was poured upon him . But is could not swerve him from what he knew to be the path of his duty . As his nearest friends know . it was not with a light heart that he took the decisive step . The party which had fought the battle against slavery had been very dear to him . In it ho had formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern voice of duty could move him to give up all this , but when that voice spoke to his conscience he did not hesitate to follow Its command . But he had the high satisfaction of receiving from his very assailants a high tribute to his character . An exasperated party spirit , even in its most wanton ebullitions. never dared to question the purity and disinterestedness of his motives . The readers of this journal , whose honored political editor he has been through many years , have long known him as a teacher . They always felt that every word he said to them was the truth as he understood it ; that he endeavored to ascertain the truth by the most careful and conscientious inquiry and consideration ; that every praise he bestowed and every censure ho uttered on any public ) man or any political party was dictated by the most scrupulous desire to be just ; that his very denunciations wore tempered with charity ; that every advice be gave was prompted by the purest zeal for the honor and greatness of the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in him because they were sure of the source from which his opinions and utterances flowed ; they knew that in that source there was nothing of prejudice . nothing or greed , nothing of envy , nothing of selfish ambition , nothing of stubborn pride of opinion  --  nothing but an ardent love of his country and of justice and liberty , and a profound solicitude for the moral health , the civilzation , and the well-being of his countrymen . He was the finest type of the independent in polities . While recognizing the usefulness of parties In our political life , ho never forgot that a party is only a means to an end , and not the end itself . He considered and discussed questions of public interest on their own proper merits . Ho conscientiously weighed in his judgment the success of which patty or candidate would be most advantageous to public welfare . and then gave his support according to his conviction so formed , unawed by power or popular clamor , unconcerned by favor or personal friendship . He criticised men and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had found to be his own error . As he was the ideal independent , so he might well have been called the finest type of the American gentleman . He was proud of his country , and yet never boastful . He would have stood in the company of Kings without embarrassment , but also without making the least demonstrative display of his ease . He was not ashamed of not being rich . He possessed that true politeness which consists in an instinctive regard for the feelings of others . His exquisite refinement of manner was genuine because it was free from all self-consciousness and aftectation , and sprang from true kindness of heart . No coarse utterance crossed his lips because no coarse thought or sentiment crossed his soul . He made his inferiors feel at home in his presence by generously recognizing their merits without oppressing them with condescending superiority . He was a distinguished man in the most distinguished society . moving in it with unpretending simplicity , and tiring only himself . When we think of the men whom we would point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would have looked upon as representative American gentlemen before all the world , George William Curtis will surely be thought of in the very first line . What his pure . gentle , lovable , and loving nature was to those nearest to him can not be expressed in the columns of a public journal . His friends must be pardoned it they speak of him in the language of eulogy , for it will be eulogy if they speak of him only the sober truth . He was . Indeed , one of those rare human beings in which the eye of criticism deteots nothing that friendship would wish to conceal ; and it may truly be said that nobody ever came into intimate contact with him without being better for it . It% a most cruel thought that the melody of his eloquent voice will never be heard again , and that his ennobling presence is gone from among us forever . There is some consolation in the certainty that most of his work will endure . that the inspiration of his example will live , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human kind , and one of the noblest:and greatest citizens of the Republic .
