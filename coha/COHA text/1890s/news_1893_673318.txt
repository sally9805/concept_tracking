txt Crime in Jersey City , especially those phases of it which are furnished by policy shops , Sunday liquor selling , and operations in " green goods , " promises to meet exposure as the outcome of to-morrow 's session of the Hudson County Grand Jury . A curious story of the ways of politics , as that game is played across the river , can be brought to light , it is said . if the people who know it are angry enough at each other to tell it . The signs seem now to indicate that they are . Grand Juries are selected three times a year in Hudson County . The body now in session began its work in April , and Judge Lippincott delivered to it a charge intended to direct its special attention to the crimes mentioned , and also to gambling as carried on at the Guttenberg race track . He said it was notorious that all of these crimes flourished in Hudson County , and decent people certainly desired that the hand of the law should be laid upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address the Grand Jury upon this subject , but until now no indictments have been found against the lawbreakers . Judge Lippincott has declared himself much displeased , while on the other hand , members of the Grand Jury say that the blame for what they have failed to do must rest upon other shoulders than theirs . A protest against their neglect of duty has risen from the pulpit . The Rev. Daniel Halleron , pastor of the Simpson Methodist Episcopal Church , has been specially vehement in his denunciation of the Grand Jury . Since Mr. Halleron has asserted that the evidence exists and that specific charges of violation of the law can be proved , he has been summoned to appear before the Grand Jury and state the foundation for his belief . He is expected to make his appearance as a witness today . " It is about time , " said a member of the Grand Jury yesterday , " that the truth in this entire matter should come out . No member of our body has supposed that it was expected of him that ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jury believes that it discharges its duty when it examines witnesses provided by the prosecuting officer of the county . That is what we have done . The prosecuting officer has brought witnesses to us and we have summoned them of our own motion upon information presented by the court and obtained from various sources . If the minutes of our body should be produced , it would be seen that we have exercised all possible diligence in what we are expected to do , and that whenever indictments have been justified by the evidence presented to us we have found them . " There is some reason , which ought to come out , why the crimes of which complaint is made in Jersey City are not brought to the attention of the Grand Jury in a way to compel indictments . Everybody knows that liquor selling goes on here Sunday . It is done openly . It is notorious , as Judge Lippincott has said , that policy shops are maintained in Jersey City , and , of course , there is noj secret about the race-track gambling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hoboken witnesses were produced who gave us evidence upon which we could indict , and twenty-seven shops in that city were closed and their owners were indicted through our efforts . It is curious that no such evidence has been forthcoming in regard to policy shops in Jersey City . " At our last appearance before Judge Lippincott on July 18 we made a presentment in which we said : " The Grand Inquest ; otherwise the Grand Jury ) respectfully presents that its attention was called to a resort in the Greenville section which has the reputation of being the headquarters of a gang of green goods swindlers ; that witnesses were summoned and evidence taken which the Grand inquest deemed sufficient to warrant the finding of true bills ; that such bills were found , but that the Grand Inquest has since been advised by the prosecutor of the pleas that said evidence is under the law insufficient , and therefore no bills were drawn . " " When Judge Lippincott beard this presentment he said : ' The court thanks you for investigating this matter . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is for this court and the traverse jury to say whether or not the evidence is sufficient . Bills will be drawn by the prosecutor . If they are not the court will investigate and learn the reason for the failure to draw them . ' " It might be supposed , " continued the juryman , " that after this presentment and the Judge 's comment upon it . the greengoods men would have been indicted . If a bill has been drawn against them , however , no one has yet heard of it . " In respect to Sunday liquor selling , this offense against the law is committed openly and regularly . The Grand Jury relies upon the prosecuting officer to bring witnesses to prove violations of the law . If he will not do it , the responsibility should rest with him and not with the Grand Jury . " With violations of law constantly going on in Jersey City , almost in sight of everybody , it would certainly seem that there ought to be a way to prevent them . Perhaps the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made friends with some of the officials and are so ' well protected that no one will dare to appear as a witness against them . If that is a fact it ought to be known . " This attempt to saddle the blame upon the Grand Jury has become rather wearisome to the members of that body , and having stood insinuations and sneering and criticism until they have become nearly intolerable , I think the Grand Jury might as well speak out . We are not bound by our oaths to be the cat's-paw of anybody . " If Hoboken policy shops can be closed while those in Jersey City flourish , the boss who is getting the worst of it ought to make his rivals suffer . Any one familiar with Hudson County politics knows what I mean without using names . " Political hornets will fly if stirred up with a stick long enough . Then the public will know why Grand Juries can not indict except as the rulers may be willing . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
