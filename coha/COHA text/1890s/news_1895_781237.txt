txt It is now practically certain that the friendly race between the Defender and Vigilant , which will be the first test of the comparative merits of the cup defender of 1893 and the expected cup defender of 1895 , will be sailed off Newport Sunday . The Defender will be finished , so far as the Herreshoff workmen are concerned , by to-morrow afternoon , and she will be formally turned over to the syndicate and will sail for Newport at once . There is a possibility that the Vigilant may sail at the same time , in which case ' a trial would at once be in order , but it is more likely that it will not come until Sunday , From Newport both boats can easily reach the open ocean off Brenton 's Reef Lightship and have plenty of room for sailing , which is another reason for believing that they will not meet until Sunday , Mr. Iselin says he is ready whenever Mr. Willard is . Mr. Willard says he will leave Bristol to-morrow . A speedy trial is the inevitable result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . The wind was fresh from the . southwestward , a working topsail breeze for the Vigilant , and she would have pushed the Defender to a full showing of that speed and sail carrying power which her trials have indicated . Every one in Bristol was hoping for a trial , but early in the day Mr. Iselin said positively Defender would not go out . He Wanted the boat finished and would give the workmen a chance . The Vigilant was ready to sail , for Mr. Willard had arrived on an early train , but that had no influence with Mr. Iselin . There appeared to be a bit of feeling between Mr. Iselin and Mr. Willard , on the part of the former because Vigilant did not sail yesterday when Defender was ready , and on the part of the latter because Defender was not ready to-day when Vigilant was prepared . The misunderstanding was cleared up however in tide Vigilant 's cabin shortly before noon . for both yachtsmen came up the companionway smiling . Time and place of trial had evidently been arranged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when asked about it . Mr. Willard said nothing except that the Vigilant was going sailing in the afternoon . The Vigilant went down the hay to Newport , returning late in the afternoon . She started out with a club topsail , but had to shift to a working one just below the lightship . Even then she took a rank heel , but was pressed for all she was worth and went off at good speed . Her new mainsail made by the Herreshoffs is a beauty , and nothing finer in cut or fit has been seen on a large racing yacht at a first setting . If it does not stretch too much it will be the speediest sail she has yet had on her in her career . Capt . " Charley " Barr says the jibs are not in good shape , but they are better at that than some that have been seen on racing boats . In the meantime the work on the Defender has been pushed , and when the workmen knocked oft to-night there was a fair prospect of finishing soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day was on the interior finish and in planing the deck . The yacht is to have more cabin work inside than was expected , but It is all very light , and much of it can come out on race days . Mr. and Mrs. Iselin Spent last night aboard the Defender , so that the boat must have fair cabin accommodations . Workmen were also busy in strengthening the chain plates for the preventer backstays . The bronze rivets had pulled a little in Thursday 's trial , so that they were replaced with steel ones and several new ones added Late in the afternoon Mr. Iselin came ashore and to the waiting correspondents stated positively that the Defender would not race until July 20 , off Sandy Hook , for the special prize of the New-York Yacht Club , . though . friendly trials would be had with the Vigilant . The Defender would now be ready to sail whenever Vigilant was . He would not say where the trials would be had or when , but it is confidently expected that he Will follow out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newport his anchorage and have the trials off Brenton 's Reef Lightship . His preference for Newport as a racing place is well known , and he has more than once spoken of it as the only place on the coast where a breeze could be expected with any confidence .
