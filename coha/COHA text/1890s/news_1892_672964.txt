txt The Philadelphia Public Ledger of yesterday reprints from the New-York Sun of June 21 the letter of Grover Cleveland on the silver question , dated Feb. 24 , 1885 , and his letter to the Cooper Union meeting of Feb. 10 , 1891 . It is obvious that these letters were not printed in the Sun to help Mr. Cleveland . In a paragraph appended to them , however , the Ledger says : " The editor of the Ledger believes that the foregoing letters  --  which constitute the real financial plank of ex-President Cleveland 's platform , that upon which he will steadfastly and unconquerably stand , if nominated  --  furnish the most powerful reasons why he should be nominated ; they are , in the opinion of the Ledger , the most irrefutable anti conclusive arguments In support of his nomination that have been or can be given by any one . There is not a representative of any material interest in the country who will not feel more assured of the national prosperity , of the maintenance of public and private credit , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats nominate a candidate who , like the candidate nominated by the Republicans , is unchangeably committed to safe , honest finance . The nomination of Mr. Harrison is , and that of Mr , Cleveland would be . a guarantee of a stable , sound currency . ' Farmers , working men , and savings bank depositors , who are the- iiret and most defense . less victims of fluctuation and unstable money , ' would all alike approve Mr. Cleveland 's financial policy as set forth in the above letters . In the spirited , truthful language of the Sun , ' It will make no diderence to him what plank these Democrats succeed in inserting in the platform of the convention . Jle will stand and he wilt act on hie own platform . ' ? And that platform will be the platform of honest money ; of a dollar worth 100 cents , gold standard , and that is precisely the platform , with an honest , trustworthy candidate upon it , that the country wants and will have .
