BY GEORGE W. SMALLEY . I. ri SHE importance of Mr. Lowell 's resiI dence in London , independently of his ministerial duties and successes , may be summed up in a phrase . His character underwent a very considerable change . This it is which tempts me to consider one side of his character and one period of his life apart . It would be more satisfactory , no doubt , to deal with the whole man , but that I can not now undertake . He has left the record of his life behind him in his books , his letters , his acts , and in the memories of those who knew him . What I wish to do-here briefly , and more fully in an introduction to some of his letters presently to be published - is to throw a little light on a much misunderstood part of his career . This part could not be appreciated by anybody who had not some knowledge of the rest , and I think it right therefore to say that I have known Mr. Lowell for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister , in Paris , in Whitby , where he passed nine summers , and elsewhere . He was my friend , my wife 's friend , the friend of the children . It is to them that most of the letters now to be printed were written . He honored me with his confidence . I know the true story of his life in England , and I have always thought it due to him that so much of it as concerns the public should be told  --  the more so since there is very little account of it in the two volumes of letters which his friend Professor Norton gave to the world . In these volumes you see Lowell as he was before he lived abroad , and to some little extent after . That is the portrait which Mr. Norton preferred to paint . His admirable selection of letters was made from that point of view-  --  the selection is admirable to that end . My aim is and will be to present to you a Lowell of whom in those volumes there are only glimpses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Madrid in 1877 that he was not pre-eminently fitted by training or disposition for diplomatic work . That was his own view . You will find hints of it in the Madrid letters . The legation and its work " bored " him , as he frankly confesses . He went there , as he quaintly owned , to perfect his Spanish-a language and literature for which he had a strong attachment . When London was offered him he was reluctant to accept ; but it was pressed , and he finally said , " Well , I came to Madrid to please myself , and it is only fair that I should go to London to please my government . " Whether he knew it or not , the offer pleased him . Lowell had a peculiar talent for disguising his delight and hiding it from himself , in this as in other things . Madrid had had little or no influence upon his character . What he was when he went there , he was when lie left , plus some training in the technique of diplomacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which an American minister has to transact in Madrid are seldom of prime importance . The society with which he comes in contact is limited , and , outside of the diplomatic and official worlds , is not quite what we understand by the word hospitable . Neither diplomacy nor society had left much mark on Lowell when he quitted Madrid . He came to London the man he had been all his life long  --  a man of books and of literature , a thinker , a dreamer , a poet , almost a recluse . The world for which he most cared lay within the four walls of his library at Elmwood . He valued his friends - never was there a friend more loyal and staiich to his friends than Lowell ; but , his friends excepted , men seemed to him more real or more near to him in their writings than in the flesh . With all his geniality he was extremely reserved with strangers or acquaintances inhis own rank of life . He was an American with the culture of Europe , but with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and art . One of the irksome parts of his diplomatic duty was the necessity of continually seeing people who did not interest him , and of discussing affairs which , to his mind , were trivial , because they did not relate to such matters as he thought of highest import . As for society , he looked upon that as most trivial of all . Against the social obligation which connects itself with diplomacy , and , indeed , forms an integral part of it , lie protested stoutly . During the first part of his life in London as minister he would hardly accept // an invitation which was not official , and therefore compulsory , or friendly , and therefore to him irresistible . The giving of dinners was a thing he abhorred , unless he were allowed to collect about him the few men and women for whom lie really cared . Them he would have liked to see constantly , to the entire exclusion of the outer circle , whom , nevertheless , he was bound to ask . Later , after he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain humorously of the strain it put upon his faculties , and to excuse himself for what he thought monotonous in his dinner lists : " My wife has no acquaintance , and I have no invention . You must not mind meeting the same people so often . " Mrs. Lowell was too much of an invalid to be able to take charge of these complicated matters . But virtue and a high sense of duty were , in Lowell 's case also , not only their own reward , they revealed to him a new world , and brought him new pleasures . Not all at once , but gradually , he came to like society , and to perform with a keen pleasure the social obligations which in the beginning lie detested . London revealed him to himself and to others . The recluse ceased to be a recluse . His horizon widened . He perceived that a knowledge of men , and of what is best in men , was to be had otherwise than from books . He became a diner-out . If that phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it will be noticed by good observers that those who heap reproaches on Lowell or on others , on that score , are themselves men who have not had large opportunities of seeing that particular world which they thus revile . Lowell in times past had perhaps something of the intellectual arrogance which most men of letters have . He cared more for culture than for character ; not in the broader sense , but as a means of social attractiveness . The men of culture were those with whom he liked best to talk , and after them the New England farmer , the stout yeomanry among whom lie had grown up , or perhaps even the bar-room loafer , who , like the farmer , could supply him with a new word , a new phrase , a new contribution to those studies in dialect in which from the beginning to the end he delighted . In Boston he knew , of course , " all the best people " ; lie was himself by birth as well as by training and nature of the best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His student life unfitted him for that , and it was not till London opened his eyes , or , I will shy , broaden*d his vision , that lie saw how largely society must rest upon real superiorities of one kind or another . Then it was that for the first time the Cambridge professor became in the better sense of the words a man of the world . For rank or for mere brilliancy of social position he never cared . He was supposed to care , or accused of caring , by those sour critics at home who find it agreeable to believe that an American of the Americans , as Lowell always was , is dazzled by the social splendors of London . But Lowell , always a student of human nature in books , now became a student of human nature in the flesh . He frankly avowed his astonishment at finding so many good specimens in regions hitherto unsuspected and unexplored . He saw that London society was , in truth , a kind of microcosm , or the whole world in little ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing . Napoleon s maxim , la carri*re ouverte aux talents , is the maxim which governs it . No doubt you may be born into this circle , yet it is equally true that mere rank will not give you an entrance , still less keep you a good place in it . To explain what will is matter for an essay , and I am concerned with it only in its relation to Lowell , and his to it . Be the reason what it may , it was potent enough to captivate this man of letters . He did not cease to be a man of letters , but he carried on his literary pursuits from a new stand-point . He cared as much as ever for good talk ; no society was possible for him or enjoyable by him on any other conditions . But the standard of the Saturday Club in Boston or of the lecture-room at Harvard was no longer his standard exclusively . In London society are to be met eminences of all kinds-literary , political , scientific , artistic , and of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a label . Lowell found that he had something to learn from nierchants , from financiers , from soldiers , from civil engineers ; they and many others talked well , each on his own ground . So did the ' country gentleman , or the young man of mere fashion , or the man whose function in life was to be born to a great estate and manage it . They were willing , moreover , to be talked to . They // had the art of listening , if only for civility 's sake , and in Lowell 's case for his own sake . He early acquired , and never lost , a reputation as a talker-not at all an easy renown to obtain in London , where charity and criticism go hand in hand . To this he was never indifferent ; possibly not quite indifferent enough , since this is a company in which one does well not to be too anxious about such matters , or about any matters . Lowell 's conscientiousness seemed at times over-scrupulous . He could not allow a blunder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Expert as he became in most social usages , lie never quite mastered the secret of complete toleration , which is one of the chief causes of the cohesion of society . Hence it was in part  --  and in still greater part for a reason which I will mention presently-tliat a distinguished Englishman said of him , " There is nobody whom I am fonder of than Lowell , or better like to have in my house , arid I am always in terror till he leaves it . " The terror was simply lest Lowell should be led into a controversy on some matter on which compromise was to him impossible . His impatience of pretentious ignorance was , in truth , uncontrollable , and he became almost at once so great a figure in London that to him was tacitly accorded a license granted to none other . With this social supremacy his diplomatic quality had little or nothing to do . A minister or ambassador is always a great personage , not always a great social figure . As minister or ambassador he is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office receptions , and the like . But I could name to you many a minister and ambassador to whom the real social life of England - real intimacy with what there is best there-has remained a sealed book . If it was open to Lowell , as it was to almost the last page , this was not because he was envoy extraordinary to the Court of St. James , but because he was Mr. Lowell . And therein , if you choose to consider it a moment , lies the complete answer to the suggestion that he ever sacrificed one whit of his independence or of his Americanism on any social altar whatever . No man who knew him but would have laughed at the notion of his being capable of sycophancy in the least degree . No man who knows English society thinks its prizes are to be had on those terms . The note is pre-eminently and above all others the note of equality . The first man to be cast out is the man who seeks favor by servility , or even by deference . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lowell - in London not less than in Madrid , and probably more . The diplomatic part of it was not in itself particularly agreeable to him . The writing oe despatches , the interview with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , the ceremonial which a diplomatic post imposes - none of these was congenial to him in itself . He went through all of them doggedly , and with a cheerfulness which was part of the gallantry of his nature . It used to be said of Mr. Charles Francis Adams , perhaps the ablest diplomatist whom we have sent abroad for two generations , that he would break off at any time in the middle of a despatch to attend a sale of coins . He was an experienced and enthusiastic numismatist as well as diplomatist and statesman . Mr. Lowell used to toil at his desk over the dreary futilities of his new profession when he had far rather have been writing sonnets to his mistress 's eyebrow , or sauntering in Kensington Gardens , the place he loved best perhaps in London . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his despatches , I imagine , will ever be cited as diplomatic models . They were not composed in the language of diplomacy , which is more or less a dialect by itself , in which words and phrases have a conventional value quite different from that of literature or of ordinary speech . Charles Sumner used to recommend the budding American diplomatist to take a course of Thouvenel , an eminent Frenchman of the Third Empire , who in his time was reckoned a master of this peculiar style . Lowell was probably incapable of putting off the literary garb ; his mind was steeped in literature . When it came to business he aimed at clearness before all things , but to divest himself of his own manner of expression was beyond his power . He had been too long the servant of the Muses to renounce their company in his sixtieth year . If the plain truth is to be told , the demands of diplomacy are seldom incessant . There is work enough to keep a minister busy during office hours ; not to engross his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell consecrated to his beloved books and his beloved pipe . The pleasant library in Lowndes Square was the scene of constant vigils , often prolonged into early morning . He was lavish of his time to friends or to any who had need of his services . When he was remonstrated with on his over-generosity , he used to answer , " They can not rob me of my nights . " He went to his interviews at the Foreign Office at first with a certain anxiety . Soon lie discovered that , as he expressed it , there was only the meeting of two minds , and whatever the subject , the nimbler wit of the two would have the best of it . Probably lie underrated the force of training and experience in such affairs , nor fully realized that lie had to contend not merely with the Foreign Minister of the moment , but with the permanent chiefs and the accumulated experiences of a great department . This it is which makes our American habit of sending amateurs to meet experts so often disastrous . Alone among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are often represented with great ability , but it is as if two men of equal powers were to argue a case in court-one of them a lawyer , and one of them a layman ; or as if we despatched a single knight-errant to attack a garrisoned castle . Very different are the services which are expected from an American minister by a portion of the travelling American public , to whom an American legation or embassy is a sort of general agency established for their convenience . People of this sort expect an American minister to find them rooms at a hotel , seats in the gallery of the House of Commons , tickets to the concerts at Buckingham Palace , admission to the royal enclosure at Ascot , and much else . When these demands became too frequent or peremptory , Lowell occasionally waxed indignant . He was the most amiable and kindly of men , but he had a due sense of personal dignity , and when an eminent American telegraphed him from a London hotel to arrange his journey to Paris and engage compartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of Mr. Lowell 's Americanism was one cause of the interest lie roused in London , and of the liking for him . It was not merely that the flavor of it was piquant , and that London is ever eager for new sensations . It was still more that this trait was so obviously genuine , and genuineness is a part of character on which the English setahigh valn ? * . There may have been Americans who thought they could make their way in London by renouncing their Americanism or by disparaging their own country . If so , they knew nothing of the English before whom they abased themselves . If ever Lowell 's large charity grew strict , it was for such as these . I know very well that it is impossible to refer to Mr. Lowell 's Americanism in England without stirring certain animosities , which were freely expressed during his life , and were not hushed by death . And since I must refer to them , I shall use a certain freedom of speech which they who trumpeted their dislike of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wholly passed over . They affected Mr. Lowell at one time deeply . They more or less colored one period of his life . In part they were personal to him ; in part they are the common heritage of every American minister and ambassador in England . They are partly social and partly political . In so far as they are political they are mostly Irish , or , which is worse , they were the censures of Americans upon an American minister conceived and expressed in order to conciliate the Irish in America . It is not necessary to spend much time in combating comments of that kind . The echo of them is still sometimes heard . The Irish , of course , complained that Mr. Lowell as minister did not take a sufficiently hostile line . It is the accepted and freely expressed Irish view that the envoy whom the United States send to the Court of St. James is sent in order to make trouble , in order to be disagreeable to England , in oi-der to embroil the two countries . Is it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who acted upon such a theory of his duty would be disloyal to his own country-that is answer enough . But the irony of the situation is not complete , or not completely visible , until you know that Mr. Lowell 's personal sytupathies were with the Irish , and that he looked upon home-rule for Ireland as in some form , inevitable . Nor is it complete till we recall what he has written on the subject , and perhaps most of all one message in a letter to Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes , dated December 28. 1884 , and // published by Mr. Norton . He describes some of his diplomatic efforts for the Irish , then says : " When I had at last procured the conditional ( really unconditional ) release of all the suspects , they refused to be liberated . When I spoke of this to Justin McCarthy ( then the head of the Irish Parliamentary party , Parnell being in Kilmainham ) , he answered , cheerfully , Certainly ; they are there to make trouble ! , " That is answer enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his diplomatic action . Their criticisms on his Americanism may best be left unanswered . He himself , so far as I know , never answered them , and seldom referred to them , nor ever without a good-natured contemptuousness . He had in him the pride  --  the just pride-of the true descendant of the Puritans . With six generations of Lowells behind him , with every fibre and drop of blood in his body American , himself one of the truest representatives of that New England which is itself , and has ever been , the truest representative of all America , and the source of what is most American in America , why should he concern himself with such criticisms ? Who were the critics ? We all know who they were . Those very Irish or Irish-Americans whom he sought to befriend , for whose rights of citizenship he contended to the utmost . It was these Americans of the eleventh hour , their feet hardly yet familiar to the pavements of New York , who undertook to teach an American minister his duty , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report-one of many set afoot , with no other apparent object than to give annoyance-that Mr. Lowell would take up his abode in Oxford when relieved of his duties as American minister . This particular story was of Mr. Labouchere 's coinage ; at any rate , it appeared in the weekly periodical which that eminent Radical publishes and edits under the equivocal , or perhaps cynical , name Truth . " Will you contradict that foolish story ? " writes Lowell and I did ; not that I thought contradiction of much avail , nor do I suppose Lowell did . He knew very well that a lie travels a league while Truth-not Mr. Labouchere 's Truth-is putting on her boots . Yet he often asked for other equally foolish stories to be denied . He was over-solicitous , but in his position over - solicitude was inevitable . He thought more of his government and of his country than of himself . You must have lived in England before you can fully understand the mischief done by the cah'imnies , and even by the careless comments and humorous inventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American minister to Great Britain . I have already said how deeply Mr. Lowell felt the attacks on his patriotism , though in public he bore them stoically . He felt the pin pricks and insect stings also . Sometimes these random rumors reached even his wife . Mrs. Lowell was said to have " presided at an American bar " at a festival of some sort in 1883 . It was Mr. Lowell 's wish that this should be set right ; that it should be stated that the use of her name-it was the English papers which were the offenders this time-was entirely unauthorized ; and that , even had her health allowed her to be present , an American bar would have been the last thing over which she would have consented to preside . That Americanism  --  the pure and genuine Americanism of New England , which Mr. Lowell 's enemies said he had lostcame out in so many ways that in England , as among his American friends there and at home , the absurdity of the accusation was manifest . Sometimes incidental evidences of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any rate , interesting and characteristic . He writes me from Deerfoot Farm , Southboro , Massachusetts , in 1885 : " I never saw a finer view than from this hill-top-forty miles on every side , with Monadnock and Camel 's Hump and Greylock and Wachusett on the horizon  --  a view full of every variety of outline and colour which he spells with the u ; some people would , I suppose , call that un-American . But what has interested me most has been the town and its people ; a pure democracy just as it came from the Cape a hundred and forty-three years ago . I often thought how hard it would be to make an Englishman understand it at all - much more , think life tolerable under such conditions . Everybody is as good as everybody else , but no better , and neither wishes nor pretends to be . I found it delightful , and could ask no higher praise for our institutions than that they have wrought such a result as this . Everybody is poor , and everybody lives comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New England was to him the ideal home . Deerfoot Farm was the home of his daughter , Mrs. Burnett , where Mr. Burnett then carried on a dairy farm . When I saw him there a year later he was still just as much under the enchantment of the old-new life he was leading . He did not and could not love it as he loved his own Elmwood , but his daughter and her children and-in the English sense of the word  --  the homeliness of the place delighted him . He liked the neighbors and the absence of neighbors ; for he had his choice . His study , on an upper floor , looked curiously like the libi-ary in Lowndes Square . They were as different as two rooms could be , but the stamp of his individuality was on both . There was always  --  and the same was true of Radnor Placethe same litter of books and papers ; not the slovenliness of the housemaid , but the orderly disorder dear to the scholar and book-lover . There were the same photographs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same evidences of that continuous literary work which he hardly ever intermitted , and the same odor of tobacco . Between him and the tough New England farmer or shopkeeper , or good New-Englander of whatever calling in life there was the same solidarity as before he went to Europe to be a diplomatist . There was that , and there was more . He understood the worldly side of his own counti-ymen the better for the very different worldly knowledge which had come to him in Europe . Just as he had thawed in London and opened his soul to new influences and associations , and found new attractions and unexpected opportunities in that crowded and brilliant social company , so did he here in the quiet New England town and on the hillside where stood his daughter 's home . I thought him even more on a level with the children . All children were to him beautiful ; his own grandchildren were of course near to him , but his wider experience had drawn closer his old sympathies with them , and they were on terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth something more than respect-in which the Queen is held in America makes her Majesty 's opinions of things concerning Americans of interest to her admirei-s in this country . It is perhaps known already that she liked Mr. Lowell , and that he was a favorite and favored guest at Windsor Castle . We are apt to think that our author 's literary renown won him the general regard of England . That is so , but it hardly explains the Queen 's interest in him . The Queen of England is not among those who think that the authors of that country are its chief glories . Literature has seldom or never , in her time , been a passport to royal favor . It is not a literary family-not a family which reads much , except despatehes and state papers and the curt summaries of Parliamentary proceedings which the Prime Minister , or the minister who leads the House of Commons , writes on his lap toward the close of each sitting for her Majesty 's information . Not many marks of distinction have been conferred during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , was it likely that an American writer should be singled out for notice because he was an American writer . It is probable the Queen knew that Mr. Lowell had published books ; less probable that she had read them ; least probable of all that they were the foundation of the regard she had for him . The regard was due to his personal qualities , and to the fact that he was known to her as the advocate of a good understanding between the kingdom over which she rules and the great common wealth beyond the seas which her grandfather flung away . For the Queen has ever been the advocate of friendly relations with the United States . She knew how much this American minister had done to promote them , and valued him accordingly . Upon acquaintance with Mr. Lowell she came to value him for his own sake , and not least , I have been told , for his somewhat unconventional independence of speech and thought . The imagination can not conceive of Lowell as a courtier . He had-which is a totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the flower-girl in the sti-eet of whom he bought roses for his button-hole and his friends . But to the Queen , as to everybody else , he would speak his min*d . The freedom he used sometimes left courtiers aghast , but gave no offence to the Queen . It may have amazed her because of its originality ; it certainly increased her respect and liking for the loyal gentleman who thought the ties of humanity universal . There was no fault of good-breeding in it ; there was , no doubt , a certain indifference to court // customs . A breath of fresh air swept through the presence-room when Mr. Lowell entered it . He was not afraid to be himself ; to be simple , entertaining , literary even , or to pour out his stores of wit and learning where such gifts are unusual . There are one or two other cases which might be mentioned of men-Englishmen these-who venture upon plain speaking to the Queen , and with similar results . No small part of Mr. Lowell 's London reputation sprang from his after-dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anything to any one not English , confessed his superiority in this difficult art . They freely acknowledge that they are not themselves , as a rule , good practitioners in this . The public dinner holds such a place in public life that their opportunities of perfecting themselves are innumerable , yet they do not become perfect . A few are excellent . Lord Granville was one ; Lord Rosebery is another ; Mr. Gladstone was magnificent when the occasion called for seriousness , and when he resolutely abstained from all attempt at the humorous ; the late Lord Houghton had , in his best moments , a light touch . As I said , they and a few others , of whom Sir Henry Irving is one , are the exceptions , and Mr. Lowell was the exception to all these exceptions . He had two things which seldom go together-felicity and authority . He began his London career by protesting he could not speak . Whether he had any fame of this peculiar kind in his own country I do not know , but , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less word will serve for that which he acquired abroad . He taught himself . He bad no model . His speaking was like that of no other . Who else was there who could be amusing and instructive in the same breath , who could talk in parables , make the keenest wit do the work of sense and reason , and when he was called upon for a homily , make a story serve instead ? Withal , he had a charm of manner which won its way to the heart . His elocution , about which he professed himself anxious , must have been carefully studied . His voice was deep and full , with vibrating tones . He understood - and there are few who understand , except in France , where elocution is seriously taught-how to take and sustain a note and not let it go . And there was no audience to which he was not sympathetic , because there was none with which he did not feel himself at home and in unison . And yet he used to go to these festivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a feeling that he had never done his best . " I make all my best speeches in the cab on my way home " - that was his characteristic Englishing of the esprit d'escalier . The one occasion on which he held in check his exuberant wit was when he presided over the meeting of Americans in London in homage to the memory of President Garfield . That difficult duty he performed with simple dignity , with pathos , with a lofty eloquence , with a true sense of what was fitting . I will add that if there ever was a question of his wisdom in the policy he thought right to adopt in England , the policy of kinship and of friendship , there was none at that time . What the English people felt , and what the English press said , were open to no criticism from the most critical American . II . The best proof of the hold which London had upon Lowell may be found in his frequent returns to it after he had ceased to be minister . Summer after summer he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released him somewhat unwillingly . There was an idea in Cambridge that the charming old university town ought to suffice for him , as for others . A feeling of something like jealousy sometimes expressed itself-jealousy of the Old Home , and of its continuing attraction for this eminent citizen of the Newer England . If it existed , Lowell paid no heed to it ; perhaps was not aware of it . At any rate , as the early flowers appeared , he announced himself , and as the spi-ing drew on , with the foliage and the song of birds in his loved Kensington Gardens came Lowell . He had rooms each year at No. 2 Radnor Place , Gloucester Square , a clean little lodging-house kept by Mr. Last , now dead . I commend the address to the pious pilgrim from America who cares for spots in London with which American names are connected . They are none too many . Lowell had what in England is called the first floor , which in America is reckoned the second . His apartment consisted of a dcuble parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our house was a minute 's walk from him , and the intercourse between the two was close and // constant . Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens were less than two minutes distant ; lie was near the junction of the two . If he had come back to London for the sake of the social whirl only , he would have chosen a resting-place in Mayfair , or near where lie used to live , in Belgravia . That was not his main object . He kept up his old relations , but had others which he valued not less . The smart world claimed as much of him as it could get . He was asked everywhere , and went where he chose . As the summer waned and the society of London dissolved , visits in the country became frequent , and the Saturday to Monday visits during the season were not infrequent . But Lowell led in good part what may be called a domestic life , with a few attached friends . He liked to give little dinners in his snug back parlor , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He liked the quiet mornings and late evenings among his books , of which he always had piles , many of them newly arrived from Paris , or from Mr. Bain 's little shop in the Haymarket , which he had frequented ever since he first came to London . The elder Bain was then in health and in charge of his book-selling business . Lowell knew and valued him , as did all his many clients ; not one of the best of them who did not set store by Mr. Bain 's wide knowledge of books and kindly intelligence . The list included not a few of the most distinguished people in England-Lord Rosebery , Mr. Balfour , Matthew Arnold , and many more . There were piles of the newest French books on Mr. Lowell 's table , and on the floor and chairs and sofas : books every where , English , French , American , Italian , probably the latest commentary on Dante ; German , which he still read with a kind of protest ; and Spanish , perhaps most congenial to him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had a closer affection than for Don Quixote , and there was no sum which he would not pay cheerfully for a rare edition of Cervantes ' masterpiece . His wealth in books was the more striking amid the modest surroundings of his treasures . He was not a bibliophile in the technical sense ; that is to say , he did not love books better than reading , and he did not collect for the sake of collecting . But lie bought what lay in his own line , and grudged no price for a book which was either essential to his studies or which VOL. xcii . - No. 551-88 satisfied the longings of his soul . I remember with pleasure giving him a first edition of Donne , that somewhat crabbed and metaphysical poet under Charles First , who had an almost sinister influence on Lowell 's own poetry . There was something in the obscurities and involutions of Donne which gratified Lowell 's craving for breaking his teeth on the toughest nut he could find ; something also which lie found inspiring in the elder man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to recommend him to all comers , for the most part vainly . But , as it happened , Lowell had never , I think , seen , certainly had never owned , the first edition . The edition valued by collectors is not the first , but the second , with the portrait - a smaller and more comely book ; nor had Lowell this either . Neither has any great money value . As he took the clumsy little quarto in its original calf covers into his hand , the gesture was that of one who is performing a religious act , reverent and tender . The book , as well as the poet , was something to him , as it is to almost every reader who has imagination or sensibility . " Are you sure , " queried Lowell , " that you are willing to part with it ? " I told him that , as he knew , I had never learned to be worthy of Donne , doubted whether I had ever really read him from end to end , and , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absent , meaning it for him . So he went joyfully away with it under his arm . There were , all the same , certain elegancies in book-making which he liked . His last Cervantes , a folio of I forget what early date , was in red morocco , gilt-as he used to remark with pride , a good binding . When the report of the Garfield meeting in London , over which Lowell presided with beautiful dignity , was printed , he had six copies struck off on vellum . I used to tell him that if he were ever indicted as a bibliomaniac this would be a pi*cc &amp; conviction . Then he pleaded that it was Mr. B. F. Stevens who was responsible for the vellum ; and perhaps lie was . He has other good books to answer for . One of these six vellum copies is mine , bound in dark morocco , with an inscription . " I hope you will think it well bound , " sajd Lowell , who looked upon binding as a mystery , or even an occult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he sent me from // America the volume to which his incomparable essay on Democracy gives the title , he wrote , " Pray like it ; the binding is the best we know how to do here . " Not the binding , but the writing of books was his speciality , and also the reading of them . " I am a good reader , " he used to say . And in a letter from Elmwood , the first of those last summers in which the state of his health kept him at home , he writes , " I have read Beaumont and Fletcher once more through , to make sure that I have not lost the power of reading . " These great dramatists were among his Elizabethan favorites ; so much his favorites that he once or twice recommended them to women , though with the characteristic caution , " There is much you will not like , but it will do you no harm ; only hold up your skirts as you go along . " He used to say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Fielding is well known ; he has expressed it with that sincerity and felicity which made his essays on great writers incomparable . He had caprices , nevertheless , and his critical faculty was not without limitations . In the literature which has stood the test of time he was , as nearly as human frailty may permit , infallible ; in other words , he made fewer mistakes than most writers in whom the creative faculty is the dominant one . In modern literature he sometimes allowed personal prejudices or personal prepossessions or the moral sense to sway his judgment . He might not care overmuch for the linguistic dexterities of such a writer as Daudet , who loses himself in labyrinths of adjectives . He had a wholesome detestation of Zola . Over-scrupulous Mr. Lowell certainly was not ; he could read and admire anything in which the literary quality was supreme . But for a modern writer who deliberately elects the gutter as that part of the world 's surface which is most congenial to him , he had only loathing . Zola 's gifts and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Frenchman made of these talents an unpardonable sin . The coarseness in Fielding , he used to say , is , in so far as it is not of his time , incidental ; the obscenities of Zola are of deliberate choice . Neither art nor letters had anything to say to them ; they were commercial ; they sold his books . I will quote a sentence of Lowell 's on style , because it is only a sentence , and because the sentence says more on this difficult subject than many an essay . He had dealt , I thought , rather hardly with Pepys as a writer , in his St. Olave 's disco*irse , and I believe I had asked him to admit that Pepys , unseholarly and slovenly as he is , had often a power of expressing himself with effect and point . Says Lowell : " I admit that Pepys was capable of writing good sentences when he tried . But Gray , for example , could n't write a clumsy one without trying , and this is what I mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He adds : " Pepys 's language , you must remember , has the freshness of being nowadays unfamiliar . There is a good deal of originality in having learned one 's English two hundred and fifty years ago , as Lamb discovered . " " Keen as was Mr. Lowell 's sense of humor , " writes E. , * " his kindness of heart never let him make fun of what was no laughing matter to others . " It is an example of self-denial . And again , after an enumeration of the brilliancies and qualities which seemed to be remarkable in him , E. says , " After all , it was his kindliness which struck me most . " This is the testimony of a keen observer-of an attached friend , no doubt , but of a friend who would do full justice to the various sides of his nature . I am not sure that he was not at his best with children , or that there are any better judges of what is best in character than some children . He understood them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. , " made himself a delightful companion to young people . He treated us all as equals , and took for granted that you were interested , and had as much right as himself to be interested in what interested him-indeed , he really thought so . He retained a great youthfulness of spirit , and was often the youngest of the company ; certainly there was no one with so much fun or such spirits , or who could talk clever nonsense so delightfully . He understood the feelings of youth , and gave young people the sympathy of one much older and wiser , but always as if he were one of themselves . In fact , he gave you himself . But he expected you to be up to the mark , and would not have understood petty motives . Then he liked you to have a good time , and would think of all kinds of ways of giving pleasure , at the * My daughter Evelyn . // cost of time and trouble , when time meant a great deal to him . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing , which made everything of interest . " Of all which here is a further illustration - from the same pen : " In 1884 Mr. Lowell began to give me Italian lessons , finding time almost regularly twice a week . He began by taking a simple Italian story , reading a page or so to give me an idea of the pronunciation , and then making me read and translate as I went along as much as I could make out or guess at . Afterwards he wished me to prepare by reading the story beforehand , and looking out and learning the words I did not know . This he thought a better method of learning a language than poring over a grammar , though he liked me to study the verbs . All these lessons he made delightful . Sometimes there were talks by the way on languages and literature . He expected every lesson to be thoroughly prepared , if it was supposed to be prepared at all . You could learn , he said , a great deal of any language by beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here also . I find in his handwriting a list of some of the Italian consonants and vowels , with directions for pronouncing . G before e and i soft , as in genius , and their see shay ( 1 hoss ) . The little Italian story , La Contessina , was dull , but it never seemed so . We had just begun Dante when Mr. Lowell went home for the last time . The changes in Lowell 's character due to his residence in London left the substance of his character what it had always been . The poet , the humorist , the true gentleman , the lover of naturethey of course remained . I have no space to dwell on identities , nor need I , except to guard against misconstruction . But , as I referred above to his liking for Kensin*ton , I will quote from E. 's notes , which elsewhere I shall use more freely : " He was very fond of London streets , but his great delight was in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens . They were a never-failing source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all seasons and weathers . The beautiful cloud effects that the very smoke and haze of the city gave at sunset , the outline of the bare twigs and branches against the sky in winter , the first dandelion in the broad bare expanse of the park , the fresh scents of the earth after a heavy rain , the first leaves on the elm-trees , the pink almondtrees by Prince 's Gate coming into blossom-all gave him a vivid delight . His favorite place was the green slope stretching to the Serpentine , under the chestnut and elm trees , the other side of the old wall ( recently replaced by a sunk fence ) which separates Kensington from Hyde Park . Here , at some distance from the broad avenue leading to Prince 's Gate , a little way off the little path in the grass which we children called the chickweed path ( for there was found chickweed for the birds ) , he Would spend many hours . He loved to go there in the summer evenings , when the gardens were almost empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I last wandered through the Gardens with this young lady , I was shdwn the spot where Lowell used always to bring his chair and sit-if he was alone he brought two chairs from the general stock not far off . The view charmed him , the loneliness soothed him ; there he brooded , and dreamed a little , and there , he said , the verses came to him most readily , and Nature was kindest to him . He and Nature were never on ill terms , nor did he find it needful to wander far afield in search of his life-long companion . It is only the cockney who must escape from the pavements in order to commune with her . Whether he liked diplomatic work or not , and perhaps because he did not like it , he put his whole soul into it , and did , I think , rather more of the routine work than most ministers do-work which usually falls to the Secretary of Legation , or to the under-Secretary . Lowell was fortunate in haVing as secretary a singularly competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the world , with a knowledge of London society widei* and more accurate than any American of his time . Why may I not say also that many of the social duties of the legation devolved , during Mrs. Lowell 's illness and after her lamented death , upon Mrs. White , whose brilliant social gifts and intellectual distinction made her for many yearsone of the most brilliant figures in the most brilliant society of the day ? Both were among Mr. Lowell 's most intimate friends . Mr. White is no longer in the diplomatic service  --  a ser // vice which , as I said , does not exist . It is an accident when an able man remains over one administration . Mr. White did , and Mr. Lowell did , but most of the precedents are the other way . Not even Mr. White 's competency and devotion , however , could induce the minister to relieve himself of all the drudgery of his office . He liked , after a while , to feel that he was not above it ; liked to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official duties ; liked to see the official paper covered with his neat handwriting ; liked to know that he was devoting to these solemn trivialities hours to which , in his private capacity , literature had a claim . Until he discovered how much social intercourse might mean to him , that also he regarded as a necessary though mild martyrdom . The first thing he writes after an attack of gout in 1884 is , " I transacted business at the legation today , " with the humorous self-satisfaction which he so often showed , as if laughing at himself . Both in Lowndes Square , while he was minister , and I think earlier in Madrid , and then afterward in Radnor Place , Lowell suffered from gout . " Never mention it in America , " he said once , with one of his twinkles , " or the Irish will quote it as one more proof of how English I am . " The pain brought out an interesting side of his character , probably an unsuspected one-his stoicism . He had the pride of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Visit him in these days , and if you did not know him well you might never guess that he was suffering . The worst paroxysms were borne in silence , with a set face which was capable of a smile . He set doctors at defiance . One summer in Radnor Place he had so violent an attack that he suspected it might be something besides gout , and asked me what physician he could see -- - " no gout specialist , but a first - rate allround man . " I called on Dr. Broadbent-now Sir William Broadhent-and explained to him what Mr. Lowell wanted . Dr. Broadhent very kindly put other things aside and went round at once to see him . It was gout and nothing else , though a very acute attack , and the pain violent . He wrote a prescription . " What is that for ? " queried the patient . " To relieve the pain : " " Thank you , doctor , but I only wanted to know it was really gout . " And no persuasion could induce him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that he was not to be conquered by pain . Later he had on4y too many opportunities . But to see others suffer was a thing he could not hear . So large was Lowell 's spirit of toleration , so wide his interest in all good kinds of humanity , that his very catholicism led him sometimes to imputethe same quality to others in a larger degree than they really possessed . He could not understand that men who had intelligence and some knowledge of the world should not get on well together , whatever the differences that divided them in matters of politics or faith . So he sometimes brought people together between whom sympathies were slight . The late Bishop Phillips Brooks-it was before he was hishop - was once passing rapidly through London ; Lowell asked him to dine , and he came . There was no time to do more than telegraph to a few men to come and meet him . The two who came were Mr. Huxley and the present writer-not very orthodox associates for a distinguished divine . Mr. Huxley was good company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fellow-agnostic . Not so , I thought , Phillips Brooks , who , to tell the truth , seemed to look a little askance at us . Lowell and Huxley talked each in his own manner , and between the two it might be hard to choose - hard to say which had more variety , more readiness , more dexterity of speech , or a wider range . But Phillips Brooks held for the most part aloof from the conversation . Lowell was the most unsuspicious of men , yet , when his guest had departed , he looked puzzled , and presently asked whether I thought the Bostonian did not care to meet Huxley . " Do you know , " said Lowell , with his admirable simplicity , " I thought Huxley just the man Brooks would have liked to meet . " There was nothing for it but to assure him that the dinner had gone off perfectly . From the briefest account of Mr. Lowell 's life in England his visits to Whitby can not be omitted . Whitby , once a small fishing-village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first inlets by which the freebooting Danes made their descent upon English shores , is now a town of some 14,000 people , and a watering-place to which Leeds and other great // Yorkshire cities resort every summer . But the old town and the old ways remain , and they were what , besides the company of friends , drew Lowell thither year after year . The picturesqueness of the place , clinging to two sides of a ravine , through which the Esk finds its way to the North German Ocean , the quaint courts and alleys , the stairways , the wynds , the moors , the granite piers like gateways to the sea , the Abbey above all , perhaps , made the place fascinating to him . I have spent many weeks there with him , but E. saw much more of him there than I did , and was much more often his companion . She writes : " Mr. Lowell first went to Whitby in 1881 , and after that spent there ( with the exception of 1884 ) a portion of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year he staid at the Royal Hotel , where his window had a wide view of the sea and piers and harbor and Abbey . The later summers he had lodgings at 3 Wellington Terrace , a small house in a back street , but where he still had a view across the roof-tops of the opposite cliff , with a jumble of red roofs , one above the other , under the hill , and the Abbey towering above the church and churchyard . He came to know every nook and corner of the town , and his face and voice soon became familiar to the people , who knew him only as Mr. Lowell , not as the poet or American minister . He made friends with the towns-people and fishermen and the babies , who clambered about the yards or long flights of steps between the houses leading from the top of either cliff to the quay-side . There is a legend among us that these small creatures soon got to know him so well that they would begin crying when they saw him coming , sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands as he went by . He commemorates them in his Whitby Al-phabet : B is the babies who made their rude lairs Among the dirt pies at the foot of the stairs . ' He used to enjoy talking with the people of the place . They reminded him in many ways , he used to say , of New England people . He found a Dante scholar in a hatter on the quay-side . But he was known not only in the town , but in many little cottao*es and inns for miles around . Mr. Lowell was an excellent walker , loved to explore the fields and valleys , and would go afoot ten miles and more over the great moors . He loved every part of the country . His mornings were often spent on the sands with a book and a friend , or on the scaur , or on the rocks when the tide was low . One of his favorite afternoon walks was across the bridge , up the Abbey stairs , and along the cliffs past Saltwick by the little path , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , going sheer down to the narrow strip of red sand and to the gray rocks and blue sea below . This walk led to the light-houses . On the way back there was tea at Saltwick , in the little cottage down in the green dell at the foot of the cliffs and just above the black beach . At other times he would come up the river with us , or meet us at Cockmill , to have tea in the garden on the banks of the stream . At all the cottages about , where you get hot water and cups at twopence a head , he made friends with the people . Sometimes he took a large party of us young people for a picnic in wagonettes . But what he loved best was to spend a whole quiet day on the moors , and we often took the train in the morning to Goathland , or some other way-station , had a luncheon of ham and eggs at the inn , and then a long walk across the moors , or a lazy afternoon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom London knew little not the least attaching and interesting of the several men to whom that name belonged-several , yet all combining easily in one genial and admirable whole . One quality in Lowell which gave rise to remark was his tolerance of bores , and of people who had little or no claim on his attention . This he certainly did not acquire in London , where impatience , and not tolerance , is the rule toward tiresome persons , and where the long-winded one soon finds his oratory cut into , and other and briefer persons in possession of the table and of the ears of the company . Mr. Lowell 's good-nature was invincible . I told him once that he positively encouraged these social pests . " Poor things ! " was his answer , " they have nobody else to encourage them . " Some of the letters in Mr. Norton 's volumes are evidence enough of his inexhaustible good-humor . He wrote to people because they wrote to him . Anybody could extract a letter from him , as they could a five - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // charity . Yet if a man presumed upon this kindliness so far as to talk nonsense in bad English , or to be slovenly in his facts , woe unto him ! There was no charity in Lowell for pretentious inaccuracy . He had the same spirit of long - suffering in his relations with his servants . There are not many people who positively enjoy being robbed and imposed upon by those to whom they pay wages , but Lowell was one . If he detected a servant in peculation or falsifying accounts , he forgave him and kept him in his service . If you remonstrated , he would tell you the man bad a wife and innocent children , and would you leave them to starve ? " If I dismiss him I can not give him a good character , and he must live somehow . " He had no notion of accounts and no capacity for private business . From the beginning , like Renan , he took what his publishers offered him for his books or other writings , and thanked God it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a handsome income he was content with a fixed moderate sum . When the Century and other magazines in later days sent him large checks for verses and essays , which he thought too slight for such ample pay , he seemed astonished at this wise liberality , and more than once protested . The early letters show him writing for almost nothing . That he should give to the antislavery cause or its organs was natural ; to him it was a holy cause . But his liberalities were not confined to these . True he could , when in the mood , pour out verses with profusion ; they seemed to write themselves . At other times he toiled and struggled in vain for weeks . Witness his account of the writing of the noble " Commemoration Ode . " All these traits , all his relations with bores , cranks , servants , publishers , and the rest , find their common origin in his inexhaustible faith in human nature , and in the theory , from which he never departed , that to bring out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence . No succession of unlucky experiences disturbed his faith . No pinch of circumstances could make him hard with others . " Love one another ' was the text from which he preached oftenest , and with a humorous , homely eloquence which was his alone . Among the friends of whom Mr. Lowell saw much were Lord and Lady Rosebery , and he was a frequent guest at Mentmore , the stately house which Lady Rosebery inherited from her father , Baron Meyer de Rothschild . Lord Rosehery is an *nglishman.witli a strong liking for America and Americans , of whom a long list may be found in the visitors ' book at Meutmore . For Mr. Lowell Lord Rosebery had a true friendship , as lie had and has for many men of letters , of art , of science-being , in a word ; a man of wide sympathies . There , as elsewhere , Mr. Lowell was a favorite and frequent guest . The house is a museum , filled with marvellous works of many kinds of art-pictures , statues , tapestries , historic pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially of that kind of art which is called decorative . In these and in the great hall , which is unique in England or anywhere else , and in the beautiful grounds and gardens and views , Lowell had that kind of pleasure which only a man can have to whom art and the loveliness of nature are alike familiar and alike part of his life . He had learned long before this to find a charm in the ease of country-house life , and wherever there was a man of culture or of real natural force - and Lord Rosebery has both-Lowell was at home . His talk in these agreeable circumstances was of his best . He was not afraid of being misunderstood if he gave a rein to his wit or his humor , or both . You may think lie need never have been , but you must remember that Lowell 's wit and humor were often of a very subtle kind , and that he risked the use of irony , always the most dangerous of all forms of intellectual gymnastics . Certain it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always understood at first , whether because he was too American , or too much himself , or because lie cared little at that time to adapt himself to unfamiliar company . There were other houses where he went as often and on the same comfortable terms . Ashridge , within sight of Mentmore , though some fifteen miles away , was one , and Lord and Lady Brownlow were among his more prized friends . Ashridge is an old place , Mentmore a new one , and the fascination of antiquity is more irresistible than that of novelty , amid no matter what surroundings of splendor . The facade of Ashridge , some six hundred feet long , is of various styles // and periods - open to criticism , say the connoisseurs , and no doubt it is , like most other things ; but there are few fronts of which the sky-line is more broken , or which have a more fantastic attractiveness . The grounds in the rear , planned by the late Lady Marian Alford , are a triumph of landscape-gardening . There Lowell used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its admirable gallery , which Lord and Lady Cowper throw open-not to guests only . Many more might be named , but a catalogue of names is dull , and I have no space to describe the varied attractions of places and persons which Lowell found in all of them . It may seem no great matter that Lowell for the first time in his life should in London have come out of his shell and found new resources in life . If the change had no other effect than to send him more often to dinner parties , it need not have been chronicled . But it went far beyond that . It took him into public life . It showed him worlds of whose existence he may have known before , but only to think them unavailing to hini . It ripened him . He extended his researches far beyond the drawing-room . It gave him courage ; not merely the courage of his opinions , which he always had , but courage to see of what moment they were to others , and what his real mission in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Court of St. James , or representative of the government at Washington to the government in London . He became the ambassador from one nation to the other , the representative of a great people , accepted and trusted by another great people of kin to the first . The Lowell who went to Madrid or who first came to London could never have fulfilled this broader and higher mission . He would have shrunk from it . He would not have conceived it to be part of his duty . He could not have perCormed it if lie had . It was riot the work of a scholar , but of the man of the world  --  a phrase which has to do duty in a better sense than that commonly assigned to it . He never would have written or never have delivered that essay on Democracy which probably reached the English mind as no other ever did , and laid before them once for all the American idea of government by the people and for the people , of which Lincoln 's immortal statement was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done nothing else , his service to his own country would have been like rio other 's . But that memorable deliverance was only one act in a long series of intertiational services . Consider what the relations between England and the United States were when Lowell became niinister in 1880 , and what they were when he went home . When , upon his renioval , he paid his official visit to President Cleveland , he said to him , " Mr. President , I come to you , like St. Denis , with my head under my arm . " That was a very considerable offering . He brought him in addition the good-will of the people of England , which was a greater . That good-will was in great measure of Lowell 's creation . He laid the foundation on which Mr. Phelps and Mr. Robert Lincoln and Mr. Bayard have since built , each a goodly structure of his own . But Mr. Lowell was the architect . I know well enough that there is a section of the American press which thinks it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and England . I have asked Americans in a position to know , Americans of authority in public life , a hundred times , whether this kind of anti-English clamor represented any great body of American opinion . The answer has always been the same : " It represents nothing at all but the longing for Irish votes . " I leave that aside . I assume that intelligent Americans do believe it for the interest of their country to foster a good understanding with the mothercountry . Assuming that , I think it impossible to overestimate Lowell 's benefactions to America . United , the future of the world belongs to the United SPates and Great Britain . Divided , it belongs to neither . Such was Mr. Lowell 's conviction . On that he acted - timidly at first , because he did not at first , nor all at once , shake off his shyness ; with growing courage and capacity as the years went on ; and finally with an authority which compelled the attention and the allegiance of both peoples . That is the transformation through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , and tried to show by what stages it was reached and in what way it was developed . The lesser things led to the greater , and I take it to be impossible to award to our minister the homage and gratitude due him unless this change and these processes of change be understood .
