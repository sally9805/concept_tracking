txt From , the Annual Message to Congress Dee ; 6 , 1887 . Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection and free trade . This savors too much of bandying epithets . It is a condition which confronts us ? not a theory . Relief from this condition may involve a slight reduction of the advantages which we award our home productions , but the entire Withdrawal of Buell advantages should not be contemplated . " ' The question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant ; and the persistent claim made In certain quarters that all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free traders , is mischievous and far removed from any consideration for the public good . The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economical operation of the Government . II . Letter of Pet . 10 , 1001 , to the Cooper Union lidding . E. Ellen/ Anderson , Ohairmalk : DEAR SIR : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to-morrow evening the meeting called for the purpose of voicing the position of the business men of our city as to " the free coinage of silver in the - United States . " I shall not be able to attend and address the meeting as you request , but I am glad that the business interests of New-York are at last to be heard on this subject . It surely can not be necessary for me to make a formal expression of my agreement with those who believe that the greatest peril would be invited by the adoption of the scheme embraced in the measure now pending in Congress for the unlimited coinage ? of silver at our mints . If we have developed an unexpected capacity for the assimilation of a largely-increased volume of this currency , and even if we have demonstrated the usefulness of such an increase . other conditions fail far short of insuring us against disaster , if in the present situation we enter upon the dangerous , the reckless experiment of free , unlimited , and independent silver coinage.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
