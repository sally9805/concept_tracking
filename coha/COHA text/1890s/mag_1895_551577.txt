EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY . By Olive Rumsey . FIFTY years ago , in the town of Northampton , Massachusetts , a socialistic experiment was tried which up to the present time has had no historian . It was akin to Brook Farm in its spirit and personne4 but on its industrial side it was widely different . Brook Farm has left to the world , as a result of a communistic experiment , only a few literary reminiscences . The Northampton Association organized its industries so well that they lived long after the commune was abandoned . The Nonotuck Silk Company is an outgrowth of the silk department of the Northampton Association . The projectors and leaders of the Northampton Association were as prominent in the activities of ante-bellum days as were the transcendentalists and li//erateurs of Brook Farm . Associated with the Northampton community , as sympathetic friends or as members , were William Lloyd Garrison , Wendell Phillips , Samuel May , David L. and Lydia Maria Child , W. Adam , George Benson , James Boyle , Charles Burleigh , and many more of antislavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , even though we are accustomed to socialistic discussions , it would be more difficult to account for than it was in the year 1842 . The years preceding and following that date were seething with projects for radical social reform . To quote John Morley : " A great wave of social sentiment poured itself among all who had the faculty of large and disinterested thinking . " England was witnessing the Tractarian movement in religion , and the Corn Law agitation in commercial affairs . Dickens through his novels was exposing the abuses and cruelties of prisons , courts and schools ; and Carlyle was denouncing all shams , political or social , in words which could not be misunderstood . France was not quies-22 cent ; she was preparing for the great Revolution of 1848 . Our own country was engaged in that tremendous moral agitation which ended in the Civil War and the emancipation of the slave . She was also vindicating her right to be called practical . Every European idealist who had a plan for social reform came here to work it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct or indirect , of Fourier 's writings arose no less than thirty-four communistic experiments , of which the " Northampton Association of Education and Industry " is no mean specimen . It is impossible to learn from the meagre records of the association now extant how much or how little of its plan is due to Fourier 's ideas . A member writing to the Boston Liberator of 1843 says : " This community is not a Fourier Association ; its success or failure is no criterion of Fourierism . " Nevertheless the ground principle , that of co-operations was first laid down by Fourier , and the organization of labor into different departments is an exact counterpart of Fourier 's phalanxes . In the fall of 1841 four or five men with radical ideas for reform drifted , from one cause or another , into the historic old town of Northampton . William Adam was a Scotchman , who began his public life as a Baptist missionary to India . While there he assisted Rammohun Roy in his translation of the Bible . Under the influence of the celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he came to this country and accepted the chair of Oriental Languages in Harvard College . He was a man of great learning and had a wide reputation as a teacher . The name of Professor Adam attracted many a student to the school established by the Northampton Association . He was assisted in the work of education by David Mack , a teacher of a girls ' school OF // in Old Cambridge . George W. Benson was a successful business man of Brooklyn , Connecticut . He was a brother-in-law of William Lloyd Garrison , and an ardent enthusiast in the anti-slavery movement . Mr. Samuel L. Hill was a cotton manufacturer of Willimantic , Connecticut . He was a " come outer " from the Baptist Church on account of the antagonism which the church showed toward the Abolitionists . Those who knew him best speak of him as a simple and unpretending man , plain in his ways , possessing remarkable sagacity , tireless industry , and a moral courage that was unsurpassed . Mr. Hill , like Mr. Benson , came to Northampton for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk . These gentlemen , through their companionship and interchange of ideas , soon reached the conclusion that the world was very much out of joint , and that society sprang from wrong principles and brought forth fruit which was evil instead of good . After much thought and deliberation , they decided that co-operation , and not individualism and competition , should be the basis of industrial society . They believed that it would be possible for man to live in comfort and plenty without excessive labor , if a community should be planned with diversity of employment , simple habits of life , and freedom of religious belief . They then planned their community and issued a circular whose cardinal principles are these - 1 . Productive labor is the duty of every human being , and every laborer has the exclusive right of enjoying and disposing of the fruits of his labor . II . It is the right of every human being to express the dictates of his conscience on religious and all other subjects , and to worship God under any form agreeable to his convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , without distinction of sex , color or condition , sect or religion . IV . The family is sacred by the laws of nature and the will of God , and no relationships shall be formed which are inconsistent with this , the root of all human excellence and happiness . V. The combination of individuals or families is an evil or a good according to the object to which it is directed . It is good to combine to counteract within a greater or less sphere the causes which have produced ignorance and vice , oppression and crime , bigotry , fanaticism and intolerance . It is good to co-operate for the pur pose of giving labor its true dignity and of making a wise division of the departments of industry . The affairs of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry were to be conducted by two distinct organizations , - a stock company and an industrial cqmmunity . The stock company and the industrial community were to be distinct from each other in their organizations , in deliberations , and in their accounts , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accounts both of the industrial community and of the stock company . The directors of one company might give advice to the directors of the other company , but no director was allowed to vote with the body of which he was not a member . The association was to be organized by those persons who had paid three fifths of the amount of the stock for which they had subscribed . The president , treasurer and secretary of the association were to be ex-ofliclo trustees of all the property of the association , and members of the board of stock directors and members of the board of industrial directors . The board of directors of the stock company was to consist of the president , treasurer and secretary of the association and four additional members . Stock was in shares of one hundred dollars , and the limit of the subscription was one hundred thousand dollars . Each share of which three fifths had been paid was represented by a vote , provided no shareholder should be entitled to more than ten votes . Stock might be paid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors ; and if a person without any capital should be deemed eligible as a member of the association , he was allowed to subscribe for one or more shares , to be paid from the proceeds of his labor . He was not permitted to vote as a stockholder nor to receive interest on the sum to his credit until it should amount to three fifths of the stock which stood in his name . Stock was entitled to an annual interest not exceeding six per cent , but interest was ' not payable under four years . Every certificate of stock contained a condition to the effect that shares owned by persons not members of the industrial community might be bought in by // members of the community upon payment of principal and interest . The stock directors were to determine in what manner all funds should be invested and to make appropriations for carrying on the different branches of the business . Individuals and families uniting together were to form the industrial community . They were to establish distinct departments of industry , and to elect a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at liberty to devote himself to one or more departments , and had the privilege of choosing his own industry . The directors of the several departments , together with the president , treasurer and secretary of the association , formed the board of industrial directors . This body was to provide suitable employment for all members and fix the rate of remuneration for labor , awarding the same wages to men and women without distinction . All materials and goods for the use of the association were to be purchased by this same board of directors , and they were to sell all articles manufactured or produced by the association . Every member of the industrial community was to live on the lands belonging to the association , and to be provided with suitable apartments . In settling with individual members , each was to be credited with the value of labor performed , charged at a reasonable rate with the rent of apartments occupied , and at cost with articles for domestic consumption . This constitution of the association was certainly unique , for it provided for two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled the capital : it would have been a collective entrepeneur and capitalist , but that the industrial company controlled the labor and the rate of wages . The stock company was an employer that could not select its own employees , a capitalist subject to the dictation of an association of workers . These companies might have stood for capital versus labor , had not thepersonuelof the two companies been the same . In short , it was the peculiar union and at the same time separation of capital and labor that makes the Northampton Association of Education and Industry worthy of serious attention . For the practical working of this scheme and the suggestions which it has to offer for the solution of this labor problem , we must look at its history . The plan seemed attractive and reasonable to such men and women as were seeking to live under better social and industrial conditions . It promised too , on paper at least , to remedy many of the evils attendant upon the competitive system ; so in the spring of 1842 , six or seven families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a suitable place to settle , they fixed upon 3roughton Meadows , a tract of land upon the outskirts of Northampton . A silk industry had been established here some years before , and as it was adapted to the purpose of the Northampton Association , the estate was purchased by it for $30,000 . It consisted of four hundred and twenty acres of farming land and fifty acres of timber land , situated on the plain where now stands the town of Florence , and stretching north in the direction of Hatfield . There was a large brick factory nearly four stories high , with water-wheel and machinery adapted to the manufacture of silk , a dye-house with necessary apparatus , a saw-mill , a planing-mill , a shingle-mill , and six dwelling-houses . The Northampton Association of Education and Industry was formally organized April 8 , 1842 . At the first meeting seven members were present ; a president , secretary and treasurer were elected ; the stock directors and a committee for the admission of new members were appointed . In due time the various departments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk , lumber , mechanical , store , educational and domestic departments . The association , as may readily be seen , did not make agriculture the basis of its industrial life . These reformers had no theories upon the benefits to be derived from direct contact with the soil . On the contrary , the manufacture of silk was the nucleus about which the other departments clustered . Special attention was given to the raising of the silkworm . It must be remembered // 25 in this connection that our community started about the time that the Morus mul/icaulis rage reached its height . The mulberry trees were already growing upon the hills surrounding Florence . In this department of silk culture they raised about a hundred pounds a year , or about what was manufactured in a week . The list of manufactured articles was not long ; it consisted of sewing silk and stick twist put up in short , hard , round shapes not quite half the size of a lead pencil . The various departments were hardly organized when two very serious questions arose for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of hours which should constitute a working day . After much discussion , the former was left for settlement until the end of the year , when the following scale of wages was adopted : under twelve years of age , one cent per hour ; between the ages of twelve and sixteen years , three cents ; between sixteen and twenty years , four and one half cents ; over twenty years , six cents . The subject of the hours for a working day was not so satisfactorily adjusted . In those days twelve hours was considered a day 's work ; and as custom is binding , many members of the association believed that a reduction of the working hours would be neither expedient nor advisable . But in this community the spirit of reform was stronger than the force of habit , and it was decided that eleven hours should constitute a day 's labor . In consequence of this opinion , two of the practical business men and heaviest stockholders withdrew from the association , leaving the finances in a crippled condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to England to spread the principles of the association and to solicit stock subscriptions . As to his success the record book gives no clue , and we may infer that silence chronicles failure . During the first year almost every day brought with it an application for admission into the community . There were three different methods of admitting people . Some were received at once as permanent members , others for a fixed period of time , six months or a year , and others on probation . One importunate class of people who wished to enter the community was that of inventors who had machines , but no money with which to operate them . In the course of this first year the association became the manufacturers of a new kind of wagon and several other worthless articles . The result of these enterprises was a gain in experience and a deficit in money . The first annual meeting of the association occurred January i6 , 1843 . The community had added fifty-two people to its list of members , and lost six . The treasurer reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a balance in the treasury of $44.32 in favor of the association . Officers were elected for the ensuing year , and new directors appointed for the eleven departments which now constituted the industrial community . New by-laws were adopted , which defined the rights and privileges of the members and the duties of the directors toward their several departments and toward the association . The allowance to each member for board and clothing was fixed as follows : all over eighteen years received $20 a year for clothing ; between fourteen and eighteen years , $14 ; between ten and fourteen years , $io ; between six and ten years , $8 ; and under six years , $5 . The rate of board was eighty cents a week for all members over ten years , and forty cents for all under ten years . This allowance must have been in addition to the regular wages , although there is no record to that effect . In talking with a member who had saved from her eighteen months of labor the magnificent sum of $i*8o , she said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than did single individuals , because there was an allowance for each child , and by lumping these allowances the money brought more comforts to the family as a whole . " Indeed , this community did not wear purple and fine linen and fare sumptuously every day . The reports of the first year seemed encouraging enough to the members to warrant the undertaking of new projects for enlarging the facilities and increasing the usefulness of the association . They proposed to build a new community house , a schoolhouse , a grist-mill , a // hennery and a tannery , and to rebuild the old saw-mill . Some of these buildings materialized , but others remained in the minds of their architects . By way of a venture , the association began the manufacture of bolting cloth ; but like many another similar enterprise , it was soon abandoned . During the year i 843 the various departments of industry were thoroughly investigated and much advice was given the several directors as to the best methods of conducting business . Of course this action on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and resignations followed as a consequence . The silk department was always the subject of special solicitude ; for upon it hung the financial success or failure of the association . In this year , 1843 , the silk dyeing was made a department by itself , the manufacture of waste silk was provided for , and $3,000 was appropriated for the silk department alone . In the educational department there was much dissatisfaction ; the director complained that the association did not provide sufficient accommodations for the school ; the parents and guardians did not like the arrangements of hours given to study and manual labor . Cooperation did not diminish the friction in the domestic department . Some women found their tasks too hard , others found theirs distasteful , and all of them could have managed better than did the director of the department . The cutlery department told its own story when it reported at the annual meeting , " Doing nothing . " In the hope that another venture might be successful , they added the manufacture of knives to their other experiments . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Reports unanimously accepted . " These were the money-making departments of the association . The members of the association now began to feel a little doubtful about their ability to reform society . They found it expedient to be more careful about the admission of members . It was decided . that no one should be received without capital , if he could by his labor do no more than support himself . Prudence and not charity must now actuate their votes . The two-headed organization was found to be rather cumbersome ; so the association revised its constitution and united its two distinct companies into one . But far more significant than either of these actions was the decision reached in November , 1843 , that three members should act as agents of the association for the purpose of founding auxiliary associations and of raising a subscription of $25,000 . During the year 1843 another reduction was made in the , hours of the working day ; ten hours were now considered a day 's labor . The association this year increased its membership by seventeen , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not much to chronicle . Professor William Adam severed his connection with the society this year ; why no one knows , unless the rumor that he found his wife scrubbing the floor can be trusted . This incident might have proved to the members , in an unexpected way , that the idea of a rotation of duties was not wholly practicable . A new department was added to the industries , that of making boots and shoes . The new members added were twenty , the xvithdrawals twelve . Just what was the financial condition of the association this year it is impossible to tell , for there are no records to bear testimony ; but if the prospects had been hopeful the secretary would have recorded no such words as these : " Mr. G. W. Benson offered to purchase the stock and property of the association and to assume all its liabilities . " This proposition was refused . Not yet were these ardent reformers ready to acknowledge themselves defeated . The energy of these enthusiasts seems to have known no bounds . They began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest of obstacles , no money . They looked over carefully every detail of the departments , for the purpose of putting them on better foundations and making them more productive ; but the reports of the different directors must have been discouraging to the most optimistic member . The director of the silk department stated // that the hindrance to a large and profitable business had been an insufficient supply of silk , and sometimes a supply of unsuitable silk . The dyeing department was troubled by a delay in procuring dyes . The silk-growing department had fallen so far short of the estimated earnings that it had no explanation to account for the deficiency . The boot and shoe department had not enough men to do an amount of work sufficient to secure a contract . The agricultural department complained that the interference of the financial agent in its affairs had completely deranged its business . There was no department which had not its grievance , and also very good reasons for its want of success . The failure of the agents to secure the twenty-five thousand dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was credited to the influence of members withdrawing from the association . The community continued its existence , ' hoping that things would grow better ; but in May of the same year two prominent charter members , G. W. Benson and David Mack , withdrew from the association . The immediate cause of their resignation is not known ; but in all probability they saw that the dissolution of the association was not far off and they were obliged to provide some means of support for their families . A new president and secretary were elected , and new directors were appointed for the various departments . But new officers could not bring vitality to the association . In September , 1845 , it was decided in a general conversation amongst the members that the association had better dissolve . It was deeply in debt , and there was no prospect of any new stock being taken up .. This was the only thing which could relieve the association , as its earnings were not large and the members that had withdrawn were calling for the stock which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee decided to close the affairs of the association as soon as practicable ; and after that date the Northampton Association of Education and Industry became a matter of history . The indebtedness involved the repaying of the subscribed stock and the debts incurred by the buying of new machinery and raw material . The association during its very short existence had managed to maintain its members , boarding and clothing them and paying the wages earned . Its successful departments were the agricultural and lumber . The silk department paid its own way and had a little each year on the credit side of its account . The other departments were barely self-supporting , and some money was lost by experimenting with new inventions . The reason for the failure of the association on its economic side was the withdrawing of ? stock by the different members ; but this withdrawing of members had its first cause in the social life of the community . In closing the affairs of the association , Mr. S. L. Hill , who from its origin to its dissolution was an ardent advocate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took upon himself the entire business of the association , assuming all its liabilities . He said to the creditors : " Give me time and I will pay you all ; if you disturb me , I can not do it . " In ten years he paid to the members all stock subscribed and all other debts incurred by the association , and gained moreover from the business , which yielded the " associates " only the necessities of life , a fortune for himself . This is but a brief outline of the association 's industrial history , - a history which is full of interest to the student of . social science , because the Northampton Association had economic features which are found in no other commune . Yet to understand this history in its most significant phases , it is necessary to become familiar with the social life of the association . The peQple who projected and supported the Northampton Association of Education and Industry were for the most part reformers ; and sad to relate , no two of the hobby riders were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible to adjust themselves to life as it was ; but they knew that they would make admirable citizens of the world as it ought to be . There were reformers in medicine , in diet , in politics and in religion . One member advocated the continental costume ; another thought raw potatoes a nutritive food . Every // " ism , " no matter how much despised in the world at large , found a warm welcome in the association . It was a home for ideas not congenial to conventional life , and each member had the privilege in the community of airing his ideas . Free thought and free speech was the fundamental principle of the association , and nonconformity of ideas was its religious creed . Naturally enough it was not the rich and the well-to-do , the satisfied and contented , who knocked at the community gate . The poor in purse as well as in spirit , the enthusiast for trying experiments , the inventor with a machine which the world did not want , as well as the men of high ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early days of the association , no man was so poor in money , skill or reputation , that an entrance into the community was denied to him . In short it was an asylum to all humanity , to the outcasts from the world . Every condition of life was represented . The farmer and the lawyer , the mechanic and the doctor , the day laborer and the minister , the teacher and the washerwoman worked together side by side . Their aim was one , - a better economic and social world . *1'he much-despised negro found warm friends in the Northampton Association ; for these idealists preached not only with their lips , but in their lives , the equality of black and white . Sojourner Truth , the " African sibyl , " lived in the community for some time . One of the members told me that he and Sojourner used to wring out the clothes together on washing day . Dr. David Rjiggles , a colored physician , made his home in the association . He was a man of much repute in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure . The growth of the association was easy and natural . No definite measures were taken to win people to the cause ; no pamphlets were published , and no tracts nor circulars were issued . People came into the association because some of their friends were already there ; others joined through the advice of Miss E. P. Peabody , Samuel J. May , David Lee Child , his wife , Lydia Maria , or other friends of the community . One member , now living in Florence , told me that he was a printer in Old Cambridge . " One day , " said he , " I set the type for the Constitution of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry . ' As I read it over , I became impressed with its principles . I turned around and said to the men in the office , I think I will go up and try it for a year . ' " He did so , learned the trade of a silk dyer , and followed it for fifty years . In Northampton he met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In speaking of the community , he said , " Those were happy days , and I have never regretted coming here . " The members of the community represented no particular section of the country ; though the greater number came from New England , there were people from New York , Maryland , Alabama , England , Scotland and Germany . Life in the community was simple from principle , and frugal from necessity . Social life was unconventional and free , going sometimes to the verge of propriety , but never beyond . Drinking was unknown , and there was no need of a court house or a jail . Vulgarity was less common than in the outer world ; and what swearing was heard was but an emphasized indignation against meanness . The family life was held sacred , as the unit of society , and families or individuals resided , according to their pleasure , either in the community boarding house or in one of the dwelling houses . The boarding house was the brick factory , of which the first floor was used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third for school , store , dining-room and kitchen , and the fourth was partitioned off by thin boards into apartments of various sizes . The domestic work of the community fell to the women , and in many cases hard manual labor such as scrubbing and washing was delegated to women who had been tenderly reared and were physically unable to endure the strain of severe work . The women of the community found life more burdensome than did the men , and , in the words of an old farmer , did more grumbling . But it must b* remembered that many of the women were not // actuated by the same ideal motives that the men were ; they came to Northampton to gratify the wishes of either father or husband . But in spite of hardships and discomforts , these idealists , both men and women , bore the burden and heat of the day with fortitude and cheerfulness . To be sure , their aim was high , - the complete revolution of society ; and if they wanted the martyr 's crown , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association who are still living speak with enthusiasm of those community days , and emphatically pronounce them happy ones . A visitor to the community , in a letter to the Boston Liberator , says : " I have never seen together so numerous a company with such free and happy characters . I have never seen such cheery , hopeful countenances and such easy and interesting manners and deportment . " Giles B. Stebbins , in his book , " Upward Steps of Seventy Years , " thus writes of his life in the Northampton community : " There was a strange charm in the daily contact with persons with whom opinions could be freely exchanged and no cold wave of self-righteous bigotry be felt . This and the hope for fraternal industry xvon from excessive toil made them cheerful amidst difficulty and discomfort . It was a study of character as well as of books ; marked individuality , moral courage , conscientious devotion to right and warm sympathies abounded . I remember a wedding at the breakfast table of the factory dining-hall , with no cards or cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squire to make it legal . The ripe wisdom and beautiful tenderness finely set forth in words or in delicate acts , by those who went from the wedding table to their work in mill , or field , or kitchen , made some weddings , where silks and diamonds and shallow compliments abound , poor in comparison . " The educational side of the association was always prominent , owing to the reputation which Professor Adam had as a learned man and a brilliant teacher . Some people entered the community for the sole purpose of educating their children ; others sent their boys and girls as boarding pupils . The directors of the educational department believed that manual labor should form a part of an educational system . Accordingly the younger children fed the silkworms for so many hours a day , and the older ones worked in the factories or on the farm . The plan was not wholly satisfactory , for the teachers found that after the pupils had worked all the morning they were incapable of profitable study in the afternoon . Many experiments were tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short to solve the problem of what relation manual training ought to bear to intellectual training in a complete scheme of education . The duties of the educational department were not confined to the training of the young ; they embraced also the moral , intellectual and spiritual instruction of the adult members of the community . Lectures of different kinds were provided . Sylvester Graham delivered one on physiology and hygiene , William Lloyd Garrison one on association , and Professor Adam one on social economy . Moral questions were often discussed in the weekly meetings of the association or in the Sunday services . To draw fine distinctions between the moral , the spiritual and the mental influences of the community would be impossible ; one line of thought colored and mingled with the others . It must be rememhered that the association was made up of people of all beliefs and no beliefs ; some were orthodox Christians , a few were materialists and atheists . One man might say , " Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy ; " but his next-door neighbor might claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the world . The people of Northampton , fed and nourished on the teachings of Jonathan Edwards , looked upon the community as a set of godless men and women with no reverence for things in heaven nor things on earth . This , however , is a reputation which I believe they do not merit . It is true that on entering the society they subscribed to no creed , and that liberal thought was the spiritual stimubis . Yet if we accept the saying , " By their fruits ye shall know them , " we must acknoxvledge that this community , taken as a whole , was an assembly of sincere // men and women acting from the highest motives , and that they feared and reverenced God and loved their neighbors as - yea , better than- themselves . Their Sunday services were simple and without ceremony . On pleasant , warm days , their tabernacle was a grove of pines , where now stands the Congregational Church of Florence ; on wintry days they gathered together in the school-room . The speaker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor . Wendell Phillips often addressed them , and so did SamuelJ . May , Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison . Life in the Northampton community could not have been dull or monotonous for want of ideas , - a charge which is brought against the Shakers and the German communities ; in truth , it was the fact of having too many ideas that ruined it . And yet these people were not all seers of visions and dreamers of dreams . There was a good proportion of practical business-like people in the community ; and these ought to have kept the association from framing that unique feature of their social life known as mutual criticism . The members made an agreement among themselves that each one should submit himself to the criticism of every other member . The object of such an institution was of course improvement and progress , and the means to that end were to be used with sincerity and charity . This mutual criticism flourished among the Perfectionists of the Oneida community ; they maintain that it is a remedy for gossip and backbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than diminished the friction of social life . Faults which might have passed unnoticed were brought to the cruel gaze of the world . Every woman could bring up a child better than its mother , and every man could do a piece of work more deftly than his neighbor . There was a general tendency among the members to labor in other people 's vineyards . This institution was formed with all honesty and sincerity of purpose , and the fact that these idealists fully believed , in the childlike simplicity of their hearts , that systematic fault-finding could be practical in this world of envyings and emulations , is not without a touch of sublimity as well as of pathos . It illustrates better than anything else what manner of men they were . The actual working of mutual criticism may be shown by the story of a farmer member . " I was , " said he , " a teamster in the community . One day I drove my horse very rapidly toward the factory . A member who stood on the steps said , If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way again ; ' but I told him that as long as I drove the horse I should drive him just as I pleased . " If you knew that farmer , you would be very sure that he kept his word . I do not wish to insinuate that life in the Northampton community was one continual wrangle ; for the members believed in the efficiency of mutual criticism , and endeavored to put it into practice with Christian fortitude and brotherly love . It failed because the community was composed of men and women , and not of angels . - One might say with truth that when the association framed the institution known as mutual criticism it signed its own death warrant . From petty differences arose serious troubles which caused this member or that to withdraw from the association . The paying back of stock to dissatisfied members crippled the association financially and brought about its dissolution . Looking at the history of the association from the distance of fifty years , we see other causes for failure which stand out less prominently than does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this cQmmunity was a gathering of peculiar people . Many of them were idealists who could not make the connection between theory and practice . They were all good , and many of them were noble ; but they were not of the class to stand shoulder to shoulder and bear the heat and fatigue of commonplace work . They were weighed down by the burden of their many ideas , and were made restless by their noble discontent with life as it was and their desire to better its conditions . If the association had been larger , with a goodly proportion of ordinary and conventional men and women , so that the reformers need // not have jostled one another , the chances for the success of the enterprise would have been increased . The members of the Northampton Association were bound together by no strong ties . The German communities , like the Shakers , adopted communal living as a religious belief . This creed was the vital principle of their lives , and in it and by it they were kept together . Their faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these rules excommunicated a member from the society . Now , the members of the Northampton Association were held by no contract whatever . The requirements and regulations were very loose ; a man might cease to be a member from any cause , trivial or weighty . In many kindred associations withdrawal from the society was at the expense of one 's property , which afterward came into the possesskin of the community . But the Northampton Association paid back stock with a promptness which was against the principles of the constitution and opposed to its best interests . They were generous when it would have been better to be prudent and worldly-wise . Brook Farm found its backbone and inspiration in George Ripley , and Hopedale was held together by the enthusiasm of Adin Ballou ; but the Northampton Association listened to no voice which spoke with authority . There was no man who stood out from the rest as a leader . Perhaps there were half a dozen men to whom the association was the chief interest of life . All of those men were industrious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthering the growth and prosperity of the community . Still it lacked the unity and enthusiasm which a whole-souled leader can give an enterprise . One might easily ask whether in the midst of so many reforms and beliefs there was no common ground . Yes , there was one thread of sentiment which held the members together for a time , and that was the interest in the anti-slavery cause . From the beginning to the end the community was a stronghold of Garrisonian abolition . The association had for one of its founders George XV . Benson , a brother-in-law of William Lloyd Garrison ; so , naturally enough , many of the people who were thrown with Mr. Benson were more or less of his way of thinking . Garrison 's method of extending his cause had nothing uncertain about it . It was aggressive and violent ; he believed in no compromises , no palliative measures . The slave must be set free and at once , was his doctrine . Now , the people of the Northampton Association were of the type of men to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves believed that there was no way in which society can be reformed except by breaking down all existing conventionalities and beginning with new principles . Many of the members were ardent advocates of Garrison 's cause before they joined the community ; and here they found themselves amidst conditions which fostered their enthusiasm . Garrison himself was a frequent visitor at Northampton . When he was worn out by his public work , he found rest among these congenial friends in the valley of the Connecticut . I ) uring the four years which made the brief existence of the association , every possible effort was made to extend the anti-slavery cause . Members of the association , then as well as afterward , were editors of its papers , agents for its societies , and speakers on its platforms . The same spirit perpetuated itself in the village of Florence , which was an outgrowth of the community . It became known in the surrounding country as a gathering place for the abolitionists . There the flying fugitive found friends and often a home . Charles Burleigh , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen years the leader of the Free Congregational Church , or Cosmian Hall , as it is known in the neighborhood . What Brook Farm has been in the history of American literature , the Northampton Association has been in the history of the anti-slavery cause ; and no record of that movement would be complete without an allusion to the part taken by these enthusiastic men and ardent women . So manifold are the interests of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry , that in a single article it is impossible to touch upon them all . We // have looked upon it as a socialistic experiment , as a centre of liberal thought on religious questions , and as a movement for promoting the anti-slavery cause . Yet there is one more point which deserves mention . The Northampton Association has a place in the labor movement of America . It was a pioneer in productive co-operation . Twenty years before the Civil War it formed a stock company , and tried by this means to unite the laborer and the capitalist , to establish the industrial independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits into his own pockets . The association did not succeed , it is true , but its failure was only partial ; that is , it was the social scheme and not the co-operative scheme which was at fault . The industries of the association were sound , or they could not have lived after the commune was abandoned . The history of co-operation in this country is for the most part a record of failures ; and after the experiments of fifty years the industrial world has to-day no better plan to offer than that which the Northampton Association tried . These enthusiasts made efforts to better the condition of the workingman by distinguishing in their purchases between the products of free and slave labor . They made a stand also upon the duration of the working day , reducing its hours from twelve to ten . Long before the world knew that there was a woman question , they gave to women for the same work the same wages which men received . The labor questions of fifty years ago were in essentials what they are now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made by the laborers themselves , and then they were advocated only by reformers and idealists . The Northampton Association has not passed out of sight leaving no traces behind it . A couple of miles from the centre of Northampton stands the pretty village of Florence . It was built by these communists , their descendants and friends . On its open square rises Cosmian Hall , a church , if it may be so called , of the most advanced and liberal views , an outcome of the religious principles of the association . Along Mill River is a series of brick factories which belong to the Noriotuck Silk Company . This company , so wealthy and well known , had its origin in the silk department of the association . Not far from the river , and along the line of the horse-car , is the Florence Sewing Machine Company , an indirect result of the mechanical department of the association . It is easy to find in Florence brick-and-mortar witnesses of the community life ; but to trace its intellectual and moral influences is a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the association to good deeds moves to-day the townspeople of Florence . The few remaining men and women who were once members of its community live still in Florence , and the town is always ready to do them reverence . Such is the history of a socialistic experiment which was begun and ended long before our war . Can so old an experiment have any meaning or lesson for us of to-day ? It is true that Fourierism and many kindred " isms " are things of the past ; but the spirit of social reform has not yet gone out of fashion . Whatever form socialism may take in the future , it can not neglect industrial organizations ; for capital versus labor will always be a vexed question , and we can not afford to throw away any suggestions which the experiments of the past may give us . On its industrial side , the Northampton Association had features worthy of note . Few communes have been manufacturers , and none have conducted their industries upon so sound arnil so intelligent a business plan , - that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of a co-operative system . The transition from this plan to ordinary business methods was an easy one . The two companies became one ; this one company shrank to one man , who was the connecting link between the association and the Nonotuck Silk Company . On its social side the community has no lesson peculiar to its own experience . The history of every commune teaches us that any scheme which attempts to reorganize society , and overlooks the fact that society grows and is not made , is foreordained to failure .
