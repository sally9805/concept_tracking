txt The present talk of renewed exports of gold exhibits once more and very clearly the fundamental vice of our fiscal system . We have about eight hundred millions of Government paper and silver money , ultimately depending for redemption at its face value upon a gold reserve now amounting to a little over one hundred millions , while the revenue laws make no provision for maintaining even this small reserve . Since last February this gold reserve has been entirely exhausted and entirely built up afresh by means of two Government loans of fifty millions each , the first of which yielded about forty millions in gold , and the second , just completed , fifty-eight millions . The depletion of the stock of gold acquired by the Treasury in February began almost at once . Before the gold subscribed for the latest issue of bonds has been all turned into the Treasury we see a slight hardening of exchange rates , and early exports of the metal are predicted . If in any quarter expectations have been disappointed that exchange quotations have not yielded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone as the result of the gratifying success of the new loan , the only comment necessary is that the expectations were not reasonable . The necessity of meeting foreign obligations arising out of the conditions of trade , from the return to us of securities held abroad , and from the approaching payments of interest on those still held by foreign investors , is not diminished by the Government 's borrowing fifty million dollars ; nor is it in any way affected by the fact that the money borrowed was all gold . In present conditions the local money rate can not be for any long time advanced by such an artificial operation as reducing the stock of loanable funds . When there is a brisker demand for money to be used in business the money rate will advance ; it will of course advance to a higher figure if the supply of funds is short . But it is certainly not reasonable to expect that a business house having no present occasion to borrow money would suddenly become a borrower merely because the Government had become one ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowing . Undoubtedly an actual hardening of the money market here owing to an increased demand for funds would have an effect upon the rate of exchange . If money were readily loanable here at a good figure it would not pay to ship it abroad to the already overstocked European money centres . It is not improbable that speculative interests are in some measure responsible for the approach of the exchange rate to the gold export point . But if our Treasury reserve were not so overburdened with the enormous pile of currency that rests upon it as to make its daily fluctuation a matter of anxious study to the capitalist and business man , and if provision were made for its automatic replenishment , speculation in exchange would attract no more attention than speculation in any other commodity . In an article in The North American Review on " Our Experiments in Financial Legislation , " Controller Eckels calls attention to the unstable condition of the Treasury in a few sensible words : " It is r'ot at all surprising that each morning the first inquiry that addresses itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy himself as to the business conditions , is , Have a thousand dollars of gold come into the Treasury or have a thousand dollars of gold gone out of the Treasury ? No one can overestimate the detrimental influence upon the country 's prosperity which such uncertainty breeds . It is an uncertainty which calls a halt upon every new undertaking and blocks every avenue of trade in ? which a busy people are engaged . It will continue to work injury to the people 's interest until present conditions are completely changed and the source of the evil completely done away with . " It may not be possible during the corning short session of Congress to press to enactment a law that will provide a remedy for the evils resulting from twenty years of fiscal experiments . But it is imperative that the problem should be considered  --  that we at least begin now the campaign of education preliminary to the passage of laws that shall establish the Government finances and the Nation 's currency system on a sound basis .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
