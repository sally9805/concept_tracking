ENGLISH SOCIAL THOUGHT . By Wi//lam Clarke . C ARLYLE and Ruskin , great as are the differences between them , will always be classed together , for their social thought was fundamentally the same ; and Ruskin has plainly told us that all he has to say on social questions he has learned from the writings of the sage of Chelsea . What were the prevalent social theories in England when Carlyle began his great career ? First , there was a superficial belief in Progress with a large P , and a conviction that we had at length found the key to Progress . This key was to get rid of all the feudal and royal trammels that had bound society , to give every one liberty to do as he liked . It was indeed what we now call Individualism . It found its expression in the French Revolution , in the American Declaration of Independence , in the early Liberal movement in England . Napoleon , that colossal Individualist , furnished the movement with an oft-quoted epigram , La carrbre ouverte aux ta/ens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Individualism . No one proposed any constructive theory , but all were for abolishing things . Get rid , it was said , of the hereditary element in legislation , of ecclesiastical privilege , of protection , of rotten boroughs , of chattel slavery , and let all start fair , and let the best man survive . As fortified and expressed by the Liberal writers and statesmen of the period , this was the aim , the sole aim , which animated the leading men of the time . It was an inevitable movement , and none now in England wishes to see any revival of the old state of things . But it was a movement which solved nothing , absolutely nothing . It cleared the ground of rubbish ; it has not laid one single stone of the social edifice of the future . There is not , I venture to say , one single problem now before the 473 nations of the civilized world , on the solution of which the founders of Liberalism , the leaders of the French Revolution , the fathers of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XVe need not disparage the very genuine and necessary work done by those earnest men when we make that affirmation . For what was the " liberty " of which the founders of the Liberal movement were perpetually speaking ? It was merely formal liberty , which in the economic sphere has resolved itself into liberty to accumulate . And that is what the old Liberalism ( which has become the new Conservatism ) really means now ,  - -  liberty to accumulate : liberty to grasp anything you can get hold of by fair means or foul , so long as you do not contrive to come within the grip of the police . It will be said that there were other and nobler objects in view on the part of early Liberalism , - liberty of speech , of printing , of association . Quite true . I do not desire to ignore the transcendent services in this respect of the early Liberals . But these objects are so fully achieved in all the leading countries of the world , excepting Russia and , to a less extent , Italy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and there is no danger of their being overthrown except in one way , by the power of wealthy men in getting as complete control of intellectual as of material production . This I do consider to be a serious danger . But this very exception proves the truth of my contention , that all that is left to the old Liberalism , which has become the new Conservatism , to fight for is the liberty of accumulation . For rich men do not fear liberty of intellectual expression in itself ; they merely fear it when it attacks their own vested interests . Carlyle saw clearly , and with the vision of a prophet , that , given a // materialistic creed having external possession as the great thing to be aimed at , the " liberty " of early Liberalism , having dissolved the ancient social landmarks , must and would degenerate into a mere belief in laissez-faire , a mere stand in behalf of the right of the strong and cunning who have acquired possessions to hold on to those possessions without any interference on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . And to-day , if you go to England or to any other country , you find that this belief in the right to accumulate is the very heart and soul of Conservatism , - a Conservatism which has adopted the creed , if not the garb , of early Liberalism . Such was the prevailing social theory in England when Carlyle began to write . It found its support in the Whig school . Whiggism was admirably defined by Carlyle as " a conspiracy on the part of those who have money to keep down those who have none . " A Whig may be defined as a " superior person , " outwardly respectable and very self-righteous . Dr. Johnson said that the devil was the first XVhig , because he broke up celestial order by his rampant individualism ; not the sooty creature with hoof and horns , but the wellconnected , fine gentleman , the Mephistopheles of Goethe 's " Faust . " I am afraid there will always be Whigs as long as the world lasts ; but happily they can never be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-righteousness to go round . If you look at actual Whig legislation , you will see that Carlyle 's definition of Whiggery was not far wrong . The Whigs exploited the great movement for Parliamentary reform for their own narrow interests , creating a suffrage exclusively middle class , from which the working classes who had borne , the burden and heat of the fight were completely excluded . They abolished slavery in the West Indies , it is true ; but they made it worth the while of the XVest Indian planters by voting them /20 , ooo , ooo as compensation . They justly earned from Daniel O'Connell the epithet of " base , bloody , and brutal Whigs , " by ignoring all their Irish pledges and passing one of the worst Coercion Acts on record . They resisted factory and mine legislation , though they knew that the workers were perishing , as a government official declared , " like rotten sheep . " They filled every post in the government , every place in the Anglican episcopate , with their own creatures . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . That was also intensely individualistic , - the saving of the individual soul in another world from a terrible fate supposed to be impending there . We must always speak with perfect respect of any genuine belief ; and nodoubt the evangelical movement in the last century was quite genuine . Put it contained within itself the germs of a miserable caricature of religion , which met with the merciless satire of Thackeray and Dickens . Of course Dickens himself was given to gross caricature ; but his Stigginses and Chadbands and Murdstones had some real resemblance to actual characters . The movement , when denuded of its very best qualities , was characterized by these grave defects : it sanctioned other worldliness , so that its votaries kept their eyes fixed and their minds engaged on a hypothetical future world , while neglecting the actual life and the individual and social duties around them . In the next place , the movement was hard and literal , absolutely destitute of imagination . Heaven was presented to the youthful mind as a sort of immense English Dissenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . By its fixing the mind on heaven and hell as places to which believers would go on the one hand and the wicked and unbelieving on the other , the social idea of creating heaven and quenching the fires of hell here and now on this actual earth was completely lost sight of . Wordsworth , in a great poem , declares that on this actual earth , which is the earth of all of us , " we find our happiness , or not at all " and if we can not build up in our own lives and in the society around us here and now any divine order , we need not suppose we can substitute for that any fancied heaven beyond our mortal sphere . The whole fact of the world , as Emerson de // dared , is here . With theological disputes as such I have nothing to do ; but I aver that any dogma which has the effect of leading us to forget present social duties and the social idea is anti-human and absolutely immoral . The result of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones of the working masses , that a man might be a pillar of the church and at the same time a cruel taskmaster , an infamous sweater , a tyrant towards his children , an enemy of the poor . And in the third piace , when the movement was at all softened , it degenerated into an unmanly , namby-pamby sentimentalism , which took a strong hold of English women . The founder and apostles of Christianity were conceived as weak , hysterical , palefaced persons with white cravats , weak spines , and still weaker heads . This was largely the kind of religious idea which Carlyle found in England when he began his great career . If religion were a thing by itself , it would not Thomas carlyle . // be proper to refer to these phases of religious life . But as religion acts with unerring force on society , as what you do is determined by what you believe , as men are not built , like great modern steamers , in separate xvater-tight compartments , it follows that these phases of religion acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so acting . Their general effect was to draw away men s attention from social duty to introspection and to make a distinction between what is secular and what is sacred , which leads straight to individualism alike in religion and in the state . I turn from the religious to the artistic feeling of the time . By art I do not understand the product of individual genius , but the general artistic sense as diffused through the nation . When Carlyle settled down at Chelsea , nearly sixty years ago , England had indeed in Turner a painter of great genius ; but as a nation she had no art . The most sordid and vulgar ugliness prevailed everywhere . If any particularly grand edifice was to be reared , it would be a sham stucco classic temple with the most hideous abortions in the shape of Doric and Corinthian porticos . The usual edifice was of what William Morris calls the " square box " order of architecture , where the house , town hall , or chapel was made to look like a travelling trunk . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it really is the only fitting receptacle for those who could defile the earth with these abominable structures . But it was especially in the economic sphere that the spirit of the time was most fully marked . The " cash nexus , " as Carlyle put it , was the one bond between man and man . It was the era of the glorious gospel of " Smithianismus , " to use the German phrase for the so-called orthodox English theory of political economy , - a phrase which , let me say , does Adam Smith great wrong , for his wide and comprehensive mind can not properly be held accountable for the dreary drivel of later and smaller men who , as Ruskin said , did not even understand the contemptible science they professed to teach . " Manchesterism " is a better phrase , for the great group of industries of which Manchester is the emporium were built up on the laissez-faire , buycheap-and-sell-dear , " devil-take-the-hindmost " doctrine , when Lancashire capitalists made their two hundred , and in some cases even two thousand per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the working classes , - as testified to by the official publications of the British government . The essence of " Manchesterism " is its theory that labor is merely a " commodity , " from which it necessarily follows that it is to be bought cheap , like any other commodity . A laborer , on this theory , is not a human being , but a mere embodiment of labor-force , like a steam engine . He must be kept going with food just as you keep a steam engine going by fuel , but that is all . Consequently his wages tend always , when unchecked by law or by labor combination , to that level of subsistence on which life can manage to sustain itself . The Ricardian doctrine of wages was , in point of fact , a translation into terms of theoretic statement of the actual condition of English labor under capitalism in the first quarter of the present century . Labor combination was illegal in England until 1824 , ten years before Carlyle came to London , and there was no effective factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that every one was " free " to make a contract , and that if a workman did not care for a particular piece of work he could go elsewhere . Because there was no formal slavery , it was assumed that there was substantial liberty ; liberty being defined as " leaving alone . " In short , the economic situation was the most absolute and hollow mockery and hypocrisy ever known . The barest economic statement respecting labor will , perhaps , be found in the works of Senior and McCulloch , the most complete and scientific statement in Ricardo ; the political expression of the theory in the English Poor Law of 1834 , and in the extremer utterances of Peel , Cobden , Bright , and the rest of the now discredited and decrepit Manchester school . Having thus briefly surveyed the general trend of thought and action in England when Carlyle began his career , let us see what was in the main the kind of gospel // which he preached to the country , and how his disciple , John Ruskin , has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what Carlyle 's influence has been on the development of the solution of the social problem , what he has done , and what failed to do . where he has been strong and weak , right and wrong . And , in the main , let me say at once that Carlyle 's influence has been mighty ; that , after looking carefully round , I can not find any other of the great thinkers of our century with such penetrating insight as his . At the time when the old-fashioned philistine Liberalism was shouting itself hoarse with its exulting paeans over laissez-faire , free trade , progress of the species , liberty , do-nothing governments , and all the rest of the old banal imposture , Carlyle proclaimed the necessity for solidarity , the rights of the state , the mockery of formal liberty to men who had nothing to eat , the futility of " leaving alone , " the imbecility of supposing that Benthamism was powerful for anything else than as a mere solvent of a John Ruskin . // wornout social order . Sixty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brilliant work , now being translated into English , " On Social Peace , " tells us that Carlyle is the real author of the modern progressive movement in England , - a statement which , with due limitations , is unquestionably true . While Carlyle 's ideas run all through his writings , " Sartor Resartus and " Past and Present " contain the essence of his social gospel . In " Sartor Resartus " he pictures a world dismantled , State and Church fallen into imbecility . Yet clothes there must be . We can no more allow human beings to walk about the streets in the airy costume of the Garden of Eden than we can permit the corporate life of the people to go untended , unregulated , unadorned . The speculative Radicalism of the French Revolution had torn the old clothes to tatters , but bad furnished no new ones ; and there were even people going about rejoicing in this fact and trying to persuade themselves and others that clothes , by which Carlyle meant rules and ordinances and social customs , were useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the instrument of production existed , there was one relation which must bind men , and that was the cash nexus . The men without land and property , cornprising the great hulk of the people , must work for the men with land and property ; and if there was no general reason , no social ordinance regulating the relations of the two classes , the relationship must come down to the bare cash nexus . Instead , therefore , of a roseate democracy with free and happy men and women , none owing allegiance to any master ( which was the crude dream of superficial early reformers ) , Carlyle saw as in prophet vision a government of the rich by the rich for the rich ; society divided into two classes , those with money and those without , and the latter , be they never so free in mere theory , being the slaves of the former ; a society dominated by vulgar , sordid aims , with the accumulation of money as its chief ideal , with the frantic , eager rush of competition becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult ; people shirking work and trying to become rich by smart trickery , by lucky plunges ; a heated , feverish anxiety pervading the whole social body excepting the unfortunate " dead beats " and a few unsuccessful , quiet people , oldfashioned enough to believe in honesty . Remember , when you read Carlyle 's fervid denunciation of democracy , that this is what he means by it ; this is what he sees , or thinks he sees , as the outcome of democracy as it was understood early in the century . And now comes the question , was he not in the main right ? We accept democracy ( I at least accept it ) as a kind of inevitable fact in nature , just as I accept a cyclone or a thunder-storm . But are we satisfied with it as we see it to-day ? Has it performed what it promised ? Is there any likelihood of its performing what it promised , so long as it remains on the old lines of laissez-faire individualistic commercialism ? Cast a glance at the world to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go first to the cradle of the modern democratic movement , to France , that being the country where the democratic ideals were consciously formulated and inspired by a really great school of writers , who have influenced the world to a greater degree than any other writers since the birth of Christianity . As I do not want to paint the picture in too black colors , let me say that I am heartily glad that the Republic has replaced Empire and Monarchy in France , and that I am convinced it has already done good work . But what a picture Every public man who has come up in France since the Republic , with one or two exceptions , stands to-day hopelessly discredited . The debt is the greatest in the world , more than $5 , ooo , ooo , ooo . The people have been swindled out of $200,000,000 by the Panama cap . italists . The working classes toil all day long for little more than a bare sustenance ; great strikes have resulted in the shedding of human blood , and the workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German workmen over the Rhine . The whole country // MR . RUSKIN AT BRANIWOOD . NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE . // is an armed camp , - the French army now , by the German Emperor 's confession , being the strongest in the world , capable of putting 5,000,000 men into the field , with armaments so dangerous that scarce any man dare meddle with them . The French navy , designed chiefly against England , is almost as powerful on the sea . French expenditure is so heavy that it now amounts to nearly i * a head on every man , woman , and child in France . And while we may hesitate to accept the pictures drawn by Zola as being absolutely true to life , we all know , and French people admit , that they contain a solid substratum of fact . Turn from France to Great Britain , the other great democratic country in Europe . Here there are certain advantages as compared with France . There is no great army to maintain , for England 's military days are over , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hosts of France , Russia , and Germany . Her skilled workpeople , too , are less heavily taxed , live better , and work shorter hours . But , on the other hand , there are some serious relative disadvantages . For while France can feed herself , the bulk of her people being cultivators of the soil , England can not . One week 's blockade of the British ports would mean , not suffering , but absolute starvation of millions of human beings . There is misery in Paris , as in every great city , but nothing like the misery there is in London . The squalor , poverty , and crime of London , Liverpool , Glasgow , Sheffield , surpass anything that France can show outside of one or two bad quarters . In London thirty per cent are below the poverty line ; in Glasgow twenty thousand families live in single rooms . The French population , too , is better distributed than the English , where extreme concentration has been going on for half a century . England , too , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world market than is France , and she has thus an immensely greater number of unemployed , who are endangering the whole social fabric . But both countries alike show that the Individualist Liberalism of the last century , which Carlyle combated , has not solved the problems it was expected to solve . It may have done good , but it has not provided any solution for our social problems . When I was younger than I am now , I used to hear it said that our troubles in Europe were due to kings and queens , emperors and generals , peers and bishops and primogeniture , and that over the seas in America and Australia , where there were none of these things , something like the millennium had arrived , though there was some hesitation as to whether New York was really the New Jerusalem . Is it necessary to show Americans that the structure of their society is just the same as that of England , and that the same phenomena are occurring ? There are crowded cities where the contrasts of wealth and poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are persons calling themselves economists and statisticians who try to show that if workingmen in America were only thrifty they could buy up the whole United States with their earnings , but I shall not insult the intelligence of my American readers by discussing such nonsense as that . Suffice it to say that , politics apart , the economic conditions produce the same results here that they do with us , - the sole advantage here lying not in political institutions at all , but in a margin of land ,  --  a margin narrowing every day . American society is divided into rich and poor , owners and non-owners , just like ours ; only the middle class is much larger and more intelligent . The fact of America being a republic has had no effect whatever on a movement purely economic . Australia is even more democratic than America , and is very thinly populated , - only one and one half to onesquare mile ; yet look at her condition to-day ; the mass of the land alienated to great capitalist owners who have encouraged speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in Melbourne and Sydney without work , reduced to beggary , population all concentrated in a few cities , where poverty and riches stare each other in the face with angry look just as in London , Paris , and Berlin . // Now , bear in mind that eVery condition asked for by early Liberalism has obtained , in both America and Australia . Manhood suffrage , vote by ballot , elective government , freedom of speech and publication , religious equality ,  --  all the old Liberal nostrums have flourished ; but they have not solved the social problem . They have been useful , they can be defended , they may all have been worth struggling for ; but they have not solved the social problem , and early Liberalism led people to expect that they would . Therefore it is that the old Liberalism is dying out . Therefore it is that we saw the other day the astounding spectacle of the Liberal party in Germany almost annihilated at the polls , and the Social Democratic party taking their place . Therefore it is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in England , because they say it is no longer Liberal . They are right ; it has taken its new politics from Socialism , not from Liberalism . The people are disillusioned with the old Liberalism . Now it is the merit of Carlyle , as it is of Ruskin , and also of Matthew Arnold , that they never were illusioned . But Carlyle 's merit is greatest , because he saw more than sixty years ago the inability of Liberalism to provide any working basis for national life . I have described his powerful dissection of the philosophy of Liberalism in " Sartor Resartus . " I come now to his reconstructive ideas , as expressed in " Past and Present . " His remedies for the social evils he deplores are fourfold : ( i ) emigration or migration to fruitful and vacant lands ; ( 2 ) a right conception of land ownership and tenure ; ( * ) a right conception of the duties of " captains of industry " ; ( * ) national education . Carlyle 's first remedy was immediately tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may date the period of emigration to America from the British Islands from the Irish famine , and from Germany from the collapse of the 1848 movement . Russian , Italian , and Scandinavian emigration was later . But , roughly speaking , emigration is no longer a solution of the problem . The United States and the British colonies have restricted immigra tion by law ; and Mr. Pearson , in his remarkable book on " National Life and Character , " has proved , conclusively as I believe , that all the dreams about colonizing Africa with tens of millions of happy Europeans are complete delusions . To-day we have the startling fact of people actually coming back to England in hundreds from Australia because they can get no work to do . Still , though its day is past now , emigration was a temporary palliative of a condition of things which , as Carlyle and Ruskin both saw , must issue in social revolution . And so far we see how Carlyle anticipated the actual movement of things , - which is the one sure sign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true are Carlyle 's views on landlordism . He actually anticipated the underlying idea of the whole of the present land movement in England , by declaring half a century ago against the private ownership of land , that fruitful cause of human misery . " Properly speaking , " says Carlyle in " Past and Present , " " the land belongs to these two ,  --  to the Almighty God , and to all of his children of men that have ever worked well on it , or that shall ever work well on it . No generation of man can or could , with never such solemnity and effort , sell land on any other principle ; it is not the property of any generation , we say , but that of all the past generations that have worked on it , and of all the future ones that shall work on it . " And Mr. Moncure D. Conway tells us that , in conversation with him , Carlyle had expressed distinct belief in nationalization of the land . British game-preserving landlordism and Congressional land grants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlyle 's plain ethical principle . It is interesting to see how in England and Germany the whole of the " free trade in land " and " peasant proprietary " dogmas of half a century ago have been superseded among the reformers by the doctrine that the land belongs to the community and not to the individual , and that to the community its economic rent must go . It is the English Tories who are now trying to buttress // up the old rotten fabric of individual ownership . In the third place , Carlyle , believing in the need of an aristocracy , held that the modern aristocracy should be constituted out of " captains of industry , " out of the able men at the head of great industrial enterprises . " Captains of industry , " said he , " are the true fighters , henceforth recognizable as the only true ones : fighters against chaos , necessity , and the devils and jfltuns ; and lead on mankind in that great , and alone true and universal warfare the stars in their courses fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Well done . This is an even more remarkable sign of insight , up to a certain point . There can be no doubt that , up to a short time ago , the most powerful minds of the time have gone into great industrial enterprises . Americans are inclined to regard the British House of Lords as a feudal institution . In form it is ; but in substance it has been largely , if not mainly recruited from the " captains of industry " and the great financiers , and it is very little more feudal or , from a democratic l ) oint of view , objectionable than the United States Senate to-day . Many of the great bankers of London and heads of vast industrial establishments have been ennobled during the last dozen years . No one can doubt that the organizers of the great industrial concerns of America or Great Britain have been among the most remarkable men o the time , whatever we may think about the character of some of them . Carlyle desired these men , whom he saw revealed as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of benevolent and intelligent ( lespots , paying their men well and treating them well , cultivating human relationship with them , developing an esprit de coips and afeeling of common co-operation in a great joint undertaking . Profit sharing is , so far as I know , first mentioned in " Past and Present , " its author asking whether " your master-worker may not find it possible and needful to grant his workers permanent interest in his enterprise and theirs ? " Carlyle had in his mind such employers as Leclaire and Godin in France , the Thomsons in Huddersfield , England , and many other capitalists in both continents . His thought divined and anticipated their action ; and here again Carlyle proved himself to be a true social prophet - up to a point . Why will not his system of " captains of industry " prove to be any permanent solution of the social problem any more than emigration ? For several reasons . First , the " captain of industry " does not transmit his genius or power or character along with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were remarkable men ; but what are their grandsons to-day ? The grandfather worked all# day long and knew every detail *f the business . grandson has his salarie manager directing the business , whil he himself plays poker in a London club , or rouge-c/-nob ' at Monte Carlo . The modern capitalist is not an organizer of industry , but a receive*r of dividends , quite as idle a person as the dde//ante landowner whom Carlyle condemns . The modern capitalist need not live within ten thousand miles of his business ; he can buy his management and his little army of experts just as he buys his labor . And as technical colleges increase and more and more people are acquainted with the highest industrial processes , the reward of the manager and expert will tend to become lower and lower . But , in the next place , the " captain of industry " theory as held by Carlyle will not work because it does everything for the worker and nothing by the worker ; it is open to the objection against kings and aristocracies , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop the intelligence of the people . But this is a part of the larger indictment against both Carlyle and Ruskin , on which I shall speak presently . Carlyle 's fourth remedy lay in national education ; and here , again , he showed himself to be a true prophet . National education is a commonplace now , every civilized nation , or nearly so , having its public state schools . But we must remember that in England , half a century ago , Carlyle was as a voice crying in the wilderness , and that British public // education was not introduced until twentyseven years after . In what respect is education a remedy for the great social disease ? there is a good deal of nonsense talked on this point . In a community of a hundred people , where only one was educated , that one would be at a great advantage compared with the other ninety-nine . But he would have less power if ten were educated , still less if twenty were ; and if all were educated , he would have no a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power is concerned . Education will never of itself make the toiling masses one whit better off . Germany is ten times better educated tha ngland , and yet Engl*h xvages are far higher than those of Germany ; and some of the richest men of our time , like the elder Brassev and some American millionnaires whose names will occur to all , had no education at all in the technical sense ; and the nation which produced that greatest of modern statesmen , President Lincoln , should know that in the large affairs of the state , and the vast sweep of national movements , character and native wit tell far more than any amount of mere culture . No : education does not of itself make people better off ; what it does is to raise healthy discontent , and so Pave the way for those changes without which either chaos or stagnation would ensue . So long as England contained a mass of illiterate peasants , laborers , and mechanics , no general forward movement was possible . Now , after twenty-three xears of Board schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany public cducation has produced two millions of Socialist voters , and has threatened the cntire existing German imperial fabric ; and the remarkable thing is that in both England and Germany this powerful weapon was put into the hands of the workers by their own masters . The great function of popular education , therefore , is to stimulate discontent and to give it an intelligent purpose and direction . And I am with Carlyle so far in thinking that " captains of industry " and aristocracies generally are useful and inevitable so long as the people are not educated . Such , then , were the four chief remedies for social ills propounded by Carlyle in " Past and Present . " But no statement of his remedies would be even approximately complete without a consideration of his views on the thing called representative government . This , as you know , Carlyle held to be a delusion and a snare ; and nowhere is his sarcasm more intense and biting than in his flings at the Right Hon. Sir Jabesh Windbag and the British House of Commons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teaching , now that half a century has elapsed ? I for one say , after knowing much of the " inside track , " as well as the exterior and patent results of the legislative bodies of the world , that Carlyle was in the main right . It is said that Carlyle 's political pessimism was due in some degree to the failure of the Reformed Parliament to do what was expected from it . But if we are to speak of failure in i 843 , what word can we find to express the utter breakdown of legislative bodies at the present time ? A greater farce than the British Parliament now presents to the world , it would be difficult to conceive . It is an elaborate contrivance for preventing anything whatever from being done . 1 know personally good men there who have assured me that they went in , meaning to benefit the peol ) le , but they found it useless and hopeless . Some miserable twopenny-halfpenny incident causes hours of debate , - precious time xvasted in despicable wrangles , - while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion whatsoever ; hours on hotirs of windbag verbiage without a single luminous idea ; honorable members , sul ) l ) oseCI to be transacting the country 's business , lounging about with their hands in their pockets , telling and listening to dirty stories in the smoking-room , strolling with ladies up and down the terrace , or drinking at the bar . This is what you may see any day in the session . You ask why such a state of things goes on , and they tell you that nothing can be done . The various parties all bring charges of obstruction against each other ; but the truth is that it is the system which is at fault . Go to the French Chamber of Deputies , and the place is frequently a // bear-garden , with one honorable deputy 's fist in close proximity to another honorable deputy 's nose . There are all sorts of groups and parties , and in a moment a new combination may be formed and the cabinet turned out of office . Nearly every deputy has his axe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no grist comes to the public mill . There is not such verbiage and humbug as in the British Parliament , but there is more corruption . When you go to the other Continental parliaments , you find more or less the same state of things , though the evil results there are corrected by the fact that the government goes on just the same whether it has a parliamentary majority or not . As for your own American legislative bodies , I think you will agree with me that they are not a striking success . Nothing I could say of them would be one-tenth part so severe as the condemnation of them I have heard from the lips of Americans themselves . In Canada the whole parliamentary system is utterly corrupt and inefficient ; in Australia , if not so corrupt , it is shifting , and on the whole contemptible . Here is what Carlyle wrote in " Past and Present " " What is it to the ragged grimy freeman of a ten-pound franchise borough , whether Aristides Rigmarole , hsq. , of the Destructive , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament ; much more , whether the two-thousandth part of them be sent , for that is the amount of his faculty in it ? Destructive or Conservative , what will either of them destroy or conserve , of vital moment to this freeman ? Has he found either of them care , at bottom , a sixpence for him or his interests , or those of his class or of his cause , or of any class or cause that is of much value to God or to man ? Half a century has gone and it matters even less to the grimy toiler than when Carlyle wrote . We have no longer parties in the old Whig and Tory sense , divided by the gulf of distinct principles , but factions clamoring for office and willing to make any promises to enable them to get thee . You know Lowell 's lines : - " Ef you git me inside the White House , You 're head with ile I 'll kind onint By getting you inside the lighthouse Close hy the end of Jaalam p'int . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of mere play-acting , - these are the undeniable characteristics of representative government as we know it . There are some excellent people in America who show a touching belief in the possibility of getting " good men " elected to office , who shall put things straight . I have watched for years the efforts to get good men elected in the municipal contests in New York , but the result is a long record of failure . Mr. George William Curtis has a very amusing account , in one of his essays , of the way in which a good man who actually did get elected found himself in a short time supporting some of the greatest rascals in the city , sliding gradually into it before he knew where he was . Besides , look at the test of party allegiance which confronts the good man when he is called on to decide between party and conscience . The good man , if elected , can , it is true , utter his protest and deliver his soul ; but that is all he can do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The party representative system is a product of English middle-class rule ; it attained its zenith in the days of Whig ascendency . The assumption about it was that two parties and only two were opposed to one another . This condition no longer obtains anywhere ; and in England itself , the home of the system , it is declining , visibly falling into chaos , and justifying much of the fierce and trenchant criticism Carlyle directed against it half a century ago . But how is it to be reformed or superseded ? you ask . The answer to this brings one to my consideration , already hinted at , of the weak side of Carlyle 's social teaching . Why was Carlyle anti-democratic ? Why was his politics absolutely vitiated for us who are born , whether we like it or not , into inevitable democracy ? Why , along with such colossal strength and vivid insight , was there such terrible weakness ? I can not do better than answer this in the language of Mazzini , whose searching // criticism of Carlyle is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but one defect in Mr. Carlyle , in my opinion , but that one is vital . I refer to his view of the collective intelligence of our times . . . . Mr. Carlyle coml ) rehends only the indz*idual , the true . sense of the unity of the human race escapes him . He sympathizes with all men , but it is with the separate life of each , and not with their collective life .... He seems to regard the human race rather as an aggregate of similar individuals , distinct powers in juxtaposition , than as an association of laborers , distributed in groups , and impelled on different paths toward one single object . " Now , as Mazzini goes on to say , " sadness , unending sadness , discordance between the will and the power , disenchantment , discouragement , - such is human life , when looked at only from the individual point of view . " We know that this disenchantment fell on Carlyle and led him to look on the great mass of men with scorn . " Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain ; and the same idea runs all through his French Revolution . The individual then being so contemptible , and no regard being had to the collective sentiment and judgment , it follows that we must resort to " saviors of society , " to Cromwells , Frederics , and Napoleons . For a Washington , who chose to obey the people 's mandate , Carlyle feels utter contempt . He reminds one here of a flunky at Windsor who informed an Am*rican friend of mine , when showing him round , that in such and such a room the Hamerican Hemperor had stayed when at Windsor . My friend , not being aware that the United States had enjoyed the luxury of an Emperor , asked whom he meant . " Oh , Gen. Grant , " was the reply : " of course he was n't hexactly a Hemperor , but you 'll ave to come to a Hemperor one day : you ca n't get along without a Hemperor . " Roughly this was Carlyle 's view : you must have your strong man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got and kept in power , and how another was to succeed him , Carlyle never explained . The followers of Auguste Comte , who take much the same view , have seriously proposed that the Republican Dictator should nominate his successor as in the Roman Empire . Now , this idea , now that all the old superstition about monarchy and aristocracy is breaking down everywhere , and nearly all the European monarchies seem doomed to perish of sheer inanition , is the sole alternative to democracy . If we are to hold with Carlyle that representative government is on the whole a failure , as I certainly do hold , are we necessarily driven to accept C*esarism , as the Roman people were after the old spirit of the Republic had died away ? From the point of view of getting reforms swiftly carried , as they were carried under Cromwell , Frederic , and Napoleon , there can be no doubt Ca*sarism is a superb and efficient engine of government in its earlier stages under a genius ; what it is in its later stages under a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of M. Zola 's La Debacle . But what of the growth of the people ? What of the development of intelligence ? What of that education which only comes of responsibility , of finding out for one 's self , by repeated efforts and failures , the true way ? What of the doctrine that he who would be free , himself must strike the blow ? It is the rights that are achieved , not the favors that are granted , which really benefit men . And if we take the collective , as opposed to the individualist view of man , we shall see that any step actually and consciously taken by the whole people , slight though it may be , is of immeasurably greater value than all the reforms imposed on the masses by a Trajan or an Antonine . Here it seems to me is the justification , and the sole justification , of democracy . We must agree then with Carlyle in his assaults on the present parliamentary system , and we must agree also that democracy is inevitable and just . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceiving that they do not conflict , because parliamentary government as we know it is middle class , not democratic , and becoming every day more and more unsuited to be the political organ of democracy . // Democracy means the rule of the people ; it does not mean the rule of politicians any more than of kings . " The neverending audacity of elected persons , " to use a happy phrase of Walt Whitman 's , is now a far greater menace to human progress than is the power of any sovereign living . But we can not go back to government by popular meeting , because in great modern communities the whole people can not meet as they met in the Agora or the Comitia . True ; but the federal Republic of Switzerland has shown us a way out in the twin institutions of the Referendum and Initiative . These give the people direct hold on administration , and do away with the baneful class of politicians . If the people are to govern themselves , these are the means by which they can do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be abolished , but rather modified and supplemented by the direct appeal . Nor at present should the Referendum and Initiative be applied in the European nations with great armies , since they would afford an ambitious man opportunity to rise to the position of dictator by the aid of the military . But England is not greatly in favor of any dictator , for she has no military power , and the United States is , I should say , absolutely free . from such liability . In these countries it is time that there should be a demand for these democratic methods . And in addition thereto , a vast system of devolution and decentralization is necessary , so that the people in their various localities can " feel the very pulse of the machine , " and carry through their own public work in their own way . Along with this thoroughgoing decentralization will certainly go a great development of municipal socialism . These , I take it , are the lines of the true progressive movement at the present time , alike for England and America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet by directing his penetrating , critical insight on the institutions which we have , he prepared the way for the newer and more inspiring ideas of our age . And now it will occur to the reader that I have said little about John Ruskin . But one must remember that , so far as I have gone , the ideas of Carlyle are the ideas of Ruskin , the latter proclaiming himself the disciple of the former . But Ruskin has added to his master 's monumental work a completely new gospel of art , a subject on which Carlyle himself was silent , but which is a necessary factor in the new sociology of our time . It is not so very long ago since a number of dry , dreary logic-choppers and shallowpated sophisters poured whatever scorn and ridicule they had at their command ( and they had n't much ) on Ruskin 's " political economy of art . " Now I find in the new Dictionary of Political Economy the most respectful reference made to Ruskin 's views , which have not only led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialism , but which have undoubtedly affected economic thought among all but the straitest sect of Ricardian pharisees . Now what were the grounds of Ruskin 's quarrel with the economists ? Before answering this , and as giving an insight into Ruskin 's ideas , let me point out that he differed from his friend Carlyle on one matter , viz. , on the latter 's gospel of work , which has lately been reiterated by a strange follower , no other than M. Emile Zola . Work , work , work , cry Carlyle and Zola . There is the true remedy for man 's maladies , the true inspiration for his life . Now Ruskin has been as untiring a worker as any man who ever lived ; indeed the amount of really great work he has produced is surprising . But he believes also in the gospel of rational play , which the working class demand for shorter hours of labor is emphasizing the world over . " What I suffer , " wrote Ruskin to a friend , " from the industries ' of human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place hell must be I We get the look of it every now and then so closely in our activest places . What political economy there , and devil take the hindmost ' in general I " In mere work there is no dignity ; without inherent usefulness , beauty , and interest , it is , as Ruskin said , brutalizing and degrading . Do you suppose there was any dignity in those fearful tasks of // piling up stone upon stone in those colossal tombs under the burning sun of Egypt ? or that there is any dignity in stitching clothes in a sweater 's den twelve hours a day ? No ; dismiss from the mind the dishonest platitudes that have been written and spoken on the dignity of mere work . Let the work be of human interest and importance , let it be well done , beautiful , and useful after its kind , let it be of constant interest to the worker , and let the intervals of work be devoted to a healthy and agreeable leisure . I dare avow that not one single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the ineffaceable stamp of genius , has been produced anywhere or at any time except among people who had opportunity for leisure . The greatest curse in America , if I may say so , is the perpetual domination of business . The world is too much with us ; late and soon , Getting and spending we lay waste our powers . The Greeks solved the problem by getting slaves to work for them , while they talked politics and philosophy , declaimed the Homeric poems , and sat spell-bound at the theatre , under the magic of the " Prometheus " or the " Agamemnon . ' We must solve it by distributing leisure and the rewards of toil justly over the whole of society , and by giving the workers interest in and control over their own work . XVe are now able better to understand the ground of Ruskin 's criticism of the economists . The English economists set up an imaginary " economic man , " whose one desire was to accumulate riches . To clear away every obstacle which hindered the economic man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Feudalism was to be got rid of because it set up another standard than that of riches , viz. , honor . Religion was whittled down into conventional morality , lest it should confuse the economic man s mind by transcendental ideas . There was to be free trade in everything , no government except to protect accumulation , and immensely increased production , - the greatness of the nation being measured by the exports and imports , number of miles of railway , billions of yards of cotton turned out , and so forth , all redounding to the praise and glory of the economic man . But Ruskin put the question : What is the real value of the articles you are producing , not to the fancied " economic man , " but to the actual man , the being of large discourse , looking before and after ? What about this sized calico , to be palmed off on some poor African native , on penalty of his being shot if he refuses to trade with you ? What about this cheap shoddy coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-baked brick which that hideous row of houses is built of , and which crumbles and chips away if you handle it with any firmne*ss ? What of this abortion of a town hall , or that hideous chapel ? What of this abominable chimney belching out smoke and poisonous vapors , and blasting every green object for a mile around ? What of that cheap and nasty furniture , those vulgar ornaments ? All these things may be riches , but assuredly these are not wealth ; for it is not well that any man should have them , and the men who made them are not themselves morally or *stheticaliy well , - and as they are not well , they are not wealthy men , and can not , therefore , produce wealth ; for true wealth is created by men who are well , the outward beauty or work being the expression of the inner healthy mind . But the " economic man , " though Wall Street and Lombard Street testify to the fact that he exists , does not represent man . Man has other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourished for centuries in which the desire for riches was quite subordinate to other considerations . The Indian artificer of Benares and Agra , the metal worker in Nuremberg or Antwerp , the skilful and delicate native artist of Japan , have never troubled their heads about bank stock or " corners " in any necessary of life ; and yet somehow or other their beautiful work is sought for the world over , while the productions of the " economic man" are being consigned to the old second-hand lumber shed or , better still , burnt in the consuming fire . And why is this ? Because the true artist does his work freely and gladly , taking pleasure in it for its own sake ; // while the " economic man " is not thinking of making anything either beautiful or useful , but something out of which he can get a profit . He is thinking , in short , of accumulation ; and to think of accumulation is absolutely fatal to art , I. e. , it is fatal to the beauty and poetry of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who employ workmen to turn out idols by machinery , idols tobe sent out along with Bibles and gin to the natives of Africa and other parts , whom the capitalists want to make money out of . Conceive of this , - a sort of reduc/lo ad absuidum of capitalist production for very likely the capitalists who make the idols are also subscribers to the Bible Society , - hypocrisy being an essential part of the economic man s accoutrement . Now there are two influential classes whom these ideas of Ruskin 's have especially affected , - artists and religious people . Foremost among artists has been William Morris , whom I have heard declare that Ruskin first set him on the train of thought which ultimately led him to Socialism . What the artists have perceived is that the present kind of commercial civilization is all but fatal to art , and that different conceptions of life and different modes of living must prevail if art is to have any great future . Did you ever conceive what it would be to live in a world absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , more than aught else , makes man seem divine ? And yet every artist knows the danger there is of our mechanical civilization completely crushing out the art instinct among men . To preserve that instinct requires a perpetual protest , a perpetual determination to be poor if need be in order to be free . The whole subject has been so eloquently discussed by William Morris in his " Hopes and Fears for Art , " that I need say nothing ; those who read that will see why so many artists are Socialists . On the other side , Ruskin has affected the religious world by burning as with letters of fire on the conscience the conviction that our civilization has been based on wrong ideas ; that at any rate if the fundamental Christian conceptions are right , then civilization , as xve know it , stands condemned . What is called the Christian Socialist movement in England is due to the influence of John Ruskin more than to any other cause . And therefore it is that Ruskin , in these two aspects of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century . Bet is there a weak side to Ruskin 's art teaching , as to Carlyle 's political teaching ? I think there is , and that it is easy to say exactly where his fallacy lies . Ruskin is for going back to methods of production which we have outgrown . Now nothing is more certain in this world than the truth of the Latin saying , Nut/a vestI*ria re/re rsurn . Seeing the unsatisfactory character of modern commercialism , Ruskin would go back to simple hand industry . It is impossible . Doubtless one of the chief problems of the future will be to decide just where machine industry shall stop and handicraft begin ; but machinery will not be abandoned , especially when we know that the electric machinery of the future will do away with much of the grimy and hideous aspect of the steam machinery of to-day . Electric motor-power will , we may reasonably hope , be so distributed that the massing of human beings in the vile abortions of modern manufacturing towns will he replaced by the distribution of people in smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so greatly increased . But that will involve democratic control of land and industry ( their control by the people themselves instead of by landlords and capitalists ) . Thus it is that the artists of England , France , and other countries are interested now in social reform , in the transformation of society . We do not want to abandon machinery , because hitherto it has accomplished , as John Stuart Mill said , so little positive good to man . What we should desire is that man should control machinery instead of machinery controlling man , and that man 's mere mechanical toil should be so shortened that he should be free for the higher creative efforts , and that every man should thus become , what every man is in germ from the savage who carves animals and men on trees , to a
