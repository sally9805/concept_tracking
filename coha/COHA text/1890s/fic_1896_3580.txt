Produced by Richard Halsey Wild Bill 's Last Trail . By NED BUNTLINE , Author of " Harry Bluff , The Reefer , " " Navigator Ned , " etc . CHAPTER I. THE AVENGER . " Bill ! Wild Bill ! Is this you , or your ghost ? What , in great Creation 's name , are you doing here ? " " Gettin ' toward sunset , old pard -- gettin ' toward sunset , before I pass in my checks ! " The first speaker was an old scout and plainsman , Sam Chichester by name , and he spoke to a passenger who had just left the west-ward-bound express train at Laramie , on the U.P.R.R. That passenger was none other than J. B. Hickok , or " Wild Bill , " one of the most noted shots , and certainly the most desperate man of his age and day west of the Mississippi River . " What do you mean , Bill , when you talk of passing in your checks ? You 're in the very prime of life , man , and -- - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears everywhere , Sam ! I do n't know why , but there is a chill at my heart , and I know my time has about run out . I 've been on East with Buffalo Bill and Texas Jack , trying to show people what our plains life is . But I was n't at home there . There were crowds on crowds that came to see us , and I could n't stir on the streets of their big cities without having an army at my heels , and I got sick of it . But that was n't all . There was a woman that fell in love with me , and made up her mind to marry me . I told her that I was no sort of a man to tie to -- that I was likely to be wiped out any day ' twixt sunrise and sunset , for I had more enemies than a candidate for President ; but she would n't listen to sense , and so -- we buckled ! Thank Heaven , I 've coaxed her to stay East with friends while I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a widow inside of six weeks ! " " Bill , you 've been hitting benzine heavy of late have n't you ? " No ; I never drank lighter in my life than I have for a year past . But there 's a shadow cold as ice on my soul ! I 've never felt right since I pulled on that red-haired Texan at Abilene , in Kansas . You remember , for you was there . It was kill or get killed , you know , and when I let him have his ticket for a six-foot lot of ground he gave one shriek -- it rings in my ears yet . He spoke but one word -- 'Sister ! ' Yet that word has never left my ears , sleeping or waking , from that time to this . I had a sister once myself , Sam , and I loved her a thousand times more than I did life . In fact I never loved life after I lost her . And I ca n't tell you all about her -- I 'd choke if I tried . It is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died soon after , and I was n't far away when -- when he went under . But that is n't here nor there , Sam -- let 's go and warm up . Where do you hang out ? " " I 'm in camp close by . I 'm heading a party that is bound in for the Black Hills . Captain Jack Crawford is along . You know him . And California Joe , too . " " Good ! It is the first streak of luck I 've had in a year . I 'll join your crowd , Sam , if you 'll let me . Captain Jack and Joe are as good friends as I ever had -- always barring one . " " And that is ? " " My old six-shooter here . Truth-Teller I call it . It never speaks without saying something . But come , old boy -- I see a sign ahead . I must take in a little benzine to wash the car-dust out of my throat . " Bill pointed to a saloon near at hand , and the two old scouts and companions moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , roughly dressed , with a face fair and smooth , though shadowed as if by exposure to sun and and wind , stepped from behind a shade tree , where he had stood while these two talked , listening with breathless interest to every word . His hair , a deep , rich auburn , hung in curling masses clear to his shoulders , and his blue eyes seemed to burn with almost feverish fire as he gazed in the direction the scouts had taken . " So ! He remembers Abilene , does he ? " And the tone of the young man was low and fierce us an angered serpent 's hiss . " And he thinks his time is near . So do I. But he shall not die in a second , as his victim did , I would prolong his agonies for years , if every hour was like a living death ; a speechless misery . Let him go with Sam Chichester and his crowd . The avenger will be close at hand ! His Truth-Teller will lie when he most depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he has sent so many victims ; go , like them all , unprepared , but not unwarned . No , he thinks that death is near ; I 'll freeze the thought to his very soul ! He is on the death-trail now ? With me rests when and where it shall end . " The face of the young man was almost fiendish in its expression as he spoke . It seemed as if his heart was the concentration of hate and a fell desire for revenge . He strode along the streets swiftly , and , glancing in at the saloon which the two men had entered , paused one second , with his right hand thrust within his vest , as if clutching a weapon , and debating in his mind whether or not to use it . A second only he paused , and then muttering , " It is not time yet , " he passed on . " He went a little way up the same street and entered a German restaurant . Throwing himself heavily on a seat , he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry and dry . Give me a bottle of the best brandy in your house . " " We 've got der steak , und pread , und peer , und Rhein wine , but no prandy , " said the German , who kept the place . " Cook the steak in a hurry , and send for some brandy then ! " cried the young man , throwing down a golden eagle . " Your beer and wine are like dishwater to me . I want fire -- fire in my veins now . " " Dunder and blixen ! I should n't dink as you wus want much more fire as dere is in your eyes , young fellow . But I send for your prandy . " The young man threw one glance around the room to see if he were the only occupant . There was another person there , one who had evidently just come in , a traveler , judging by a good-sized valise that was on the floor beside his chair . This person looked young , for the face , or as much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard , was fair and smooth as that of a woman ; while the hair which shaded his white brow was dark as night , soft and glossy as silk , hanging on short , curling masses about his face and neck . He was dressed rather better than the usual run of travelers ; in a good black broad-cloth suit -- wore a heavy gold watch-chain , had on a fine linen shirt , with a diamond pin in the bosom , and appeared to feel quite satisfied with himself , from the cool and easy manner in which he gave his orders for a good , substantial meal , in a voice rather low and musical for one of his apparent age . The last comer eyed this person very closely , and a smile almost , like contempt rose on his face , when the dark-eyed stranger called for claret wine , or if they had not that , for a cup of tea . But his own strong drink was now brought in , and pouring out a glassful of undiluted brandy he drank it down and muttered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . My veins would stiffen without it . It has carried me so far , and it must to the end . Then -- no matter ! " The stranger or traveler looked as if wondering that the young man could take such a fearful dose of fiery liquor , and the wonder must have increased when a second glassful was drained before the food was on the table . But the latter came in now , and the traveler and the young man with auburn hair , at separate tables , were apparently too busy in disposing of the eatables to take any further notice of each other . When the first had finished , he took a roll of cigarettes from one of his pockets , selected one , took a match from a silver box , drawn from the same pocket , and lighting his cigarette , threw a cloud of smoke above his head . The second , pouring out his third glass of brandy , sipped it quietly -- the first two glasses having evidently supplied the fire he craved so fiercely . The traveler , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now rose , and as if impelled by natural politeness , tendered a cigarette to the other . The man with auburn hair looked surprised , and his fierce , wild face softened a little , as he said : " Thank you , no . I drink sometimes , like a fish , but I do n't smoke . Tobacco shakes the nerves , they say , and I want my nerves steady . " Strong drink will shake them more , I 've heard , " said the traveler , in his low , musical voice . " But you seem to have a steady hand though you take brandy as if used to it . " " My hand is steady , stranger . " was the reply . " There is not a man on the Rio Grande border , where I came from , that can strike a center at twenty paces with a revolver as often as I. And with a rifle at one hundred yards I can most generally drop a deer with a ball between his eyes , if he is looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without hurting his body . " " Then , you are from Texas ? " " Yes , sir . And you ? " " From the East , sir . I have traveled in the South -- all over , in fact -- but my home is in the old Empire State . " If it is n't impudent , which way are you bound now ? " " I have n't quite decided . I may go to the Black Hills -- may remain around here awhile -- it seems to be rather a pleasant place . " " Yes , for them that like it . I 'm off for the Black Hills , myself . " " Ah ! with a company ? " " Not much ! But there 's a company going . I 'm one of them that do n't care much for company , and can take better care of myself alone than with a crowd about me . " " So ! Well , it is a good thing to be independent . Do you know the party that is going ? " " Some of ' em , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has California Joe , Cap'n Jack , and about twenty more in his party . And Wild Bill has just come on the train , and I heard him say he was going with the crowd . " " Wild Bill ! " cried the stranger , flushing up . " Did you say he was going ? " " Yes . " " Then I 'd like to go , too -- but I 'd like to go with another party , either just before or behind that party . Do you know Wild Bill ? " " Know him ! Who does not ? Has n't he killed more men than any other white man in the States and Territories -- I 'll not say how , but is he not a hyena , sopped in blood ? " " You do not like him ? " " Who says I do n't ? " " You do ! Your eyes flash hate while you speak of him . " " Do they ? Well , maybe I do n't like him as well as I do a glass of brandy -- maybe I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't at all unlikely . " The traveler sighed , and with an anxious look , said : " You do n't bear him any grudge , do you ? You would n't harm him ? " A strange look passes like a flash over the face of the other : he seemed to read the thoughts or wishes of the traveler in a glance . " Oh , no , " he said , with assumed carelessness . " Accidents will happen in the best families . It 's not in me to bear a grudge , because Bill may have wiped out fifteen or twenty Texans , while they were foolin ' around in his way . As to harm -- he 's too ready with his six-shooter , old Truth-Teller , he calls it , to stand in much danger . I 'm quick , but he is quicker . You take a good deal of interest in him ? Do you know him ? " " Yes ; that is , I know him by sight . He is thought a great deal of by an intimate friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in him . " " And that friend is a woman ? " " Why do you think so ? " " It is a fancy of mine . " " Well , I will not contradict you . For her sake I would hate to see any evil befall him . " There was a cynical smile on the face of the young man with auburn hair . " If a woman loved him , she ought , not to leave him , for his life is mighty uncertain , " said the latter . " I heard him say to Captain Chichester , not half an hour ago , that he did n't believe he would live long , and such a man as he is sure to die with his boots on ! " " Did he say that ? " asked the traveler . " Yes ; and he seemed to feel it , too . He had to do as I do , fire up with something strong to get life into his veins . " " Poor fellow ! He had better have staid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lawless section . " " Stranger , there may n't be much law out this way , but justice is n't always blind out here . If you stay long enough , you may learn that . " " Very likely ; but you spoke of going to those Black Hills . " " Yes , I 'm going . " " Will you let me go with you ? " " You do n't look much like roughing it , and the trip is not only hard , but it may be dangerous . The redskins are beginning to act wolfish on the plains . " " I think I can stand as much hardship as you . You are light and slender . " " But tough as an old buffalo bull , for all that . I 've been brought up in the saddle , with rifle and lasso in hand . I 'm used to wind and weather , sunshine and storm -- they 're all alike to me . " " And Indians ? " " Yes -- to Comanche , Kiowa , and Apache . But these Cheyennes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll soon learn them too , I reckon . There 's one thing sure , I do n't go in no crowd of twenty or thirty , with wagons or pack mules along to tempt the cusses with , while they make the travel slow . You want either a big crowd or a very small one , if you travel in an Indian country . " You have not answered my question yet . Will you let me go through to the Black Hills with you ? " " Why do n't you go with the other party ? They 'll take you , I 'll bet . " " I do not want to go where Wild Bill will see me . He may think his wife has sent me as a spy on his movements and actions . " " His wife ! Is he married ? It must be something new . " " It is . He was married only a short time ago to a woman who almost worships him . She did all she could to keep him from going out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You can go with me ! " said the other , abruptly , after a keen and searching look in the traveler 's face . " What is your name ? " " Willie Pond . " " Rather a deep Pond , if I know what water is , " said the auburn-haired man , to himself , and then he asked , in a louder tone , " have you horse and arms ? " " No ; I just came on the train from the East . But there is money -- buy me a good horse , saddle , and bridle . I 'll see to getting arms . " And Mr. Willie Pond handed the other a five-hundred dollar treasury note . " You do n't ask my name , and you trust me with money as if you knew I was honest . " " You 'll tell me your name when you feel like it ! " was the rejoinder . " As to your honesty , if I think you are safe to travel with , you 're safe to trust my money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is safe . As to my name , call me Jack . It is short , if it is n't sweet . Some time I 'll tell you the rest of it . " " All right , Jack . Take your own time . And now get all ready to start either ahead or just behind the other party . " " We 'll not go ahead . Where will you stay to-night ? " " Wherever you think best . " " All right . This old Dutchman keeps rooms for lodgers . You 'd better stay here , and if you do n't want Bill to see you , keep pretty close in doors . He 'll be out in the Black Hillers ' camp , or in the saloons where they sell benzine and run faro banks . Bill is death on cards . " " So I 've heard , " said Mr. Pond , with a sigh . Jack now went out , and Pond called the Dutch landlord to him and engaged a room . CHAPTER II . PERSIMMON BILL . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German restaurant , he went to a livery-stable near by , called for his own horse , which was kept there , and the instant it was saddled he mounted , and at a gallop rode westward from the town . He did not draw rein for full an hour , and then he had covered somewhere between eight and ten miles of ground , following no course or trail , but riding in a course as straight as the flight of an arrow . He halted then in a small ravine , nearly hidden by a growth of thick brush , and gave a peculiar whistle . Thrice had this sounded , when a man came cautiously out of the ravine , or rather out of its mouth . He was tall , slender , yet seemed to possess the bone and muscle of a giant . His eyes were jet black , fierce and flashing , and his face had a stern , almost classic beauty of feature , which would have made him a model in the ancient age of sculpture . He carried a repeating rifle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His dress was buckskin , from head to foot . " You are Persimmon Bill ? " said Jack , in a tone of inquiry . " Yes . Who are you , and how came you by the signal that called me out ? " " A woman in town gave it to me , knowing she could trust me . " " Was her first name Addie ? " " Her last name was Neidic . " " All right . I see she has trusted you . What do you want ? " " Help in a matter of revenge . " " Good ! You can have it . How much help is wanted ? " " I want one man taken from a party , alive , when he gets beyond civilized help , so that I can see him tortured . I want him to die by inches . " " How large is his party , and where are they now ? " " The party numbers between twenty and thirty ; they are in camp in the edge of Laramie , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If all the party are wiped out but the one you want , will it matter to you ? " " No ; they are his friends , and as such I hate them ! " " All right . Get me a list of their numbers and names , how armed , what animals and stores they have , every fact , so I can be ready . They will never get more than half way to the Hills , and the one you want shall be delivered , bound into your hands . All this , and more , will I do for her who sent you here ! " " You love her ? " " She loves me ! I 'm not one to waste much breath on talking love . My Ogallalla Sioux warriors know me as the soldier-killer . Be cautious when you go back , and give no hint to any one but Addie Neidic that there is a living being in Dead Man 's Hollow , for so this ravine is called in there . " " Do not fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew Addie Neidic before I came here , met her by accident , revealed myself and wants , and she sent me to you . " " It is right . Go back , and be cautious to give the signal if you seek me , or you might lose your scalp before you saw me . " " My scalp ? " " Yes ; my guards are vigilant and rough . " " Your guards ? " Persimmon Bill laughed at the look of wonder in the face of his visitor , and with his hand to his mouth , gave a shrill , warbling cry . In a second this mouth of the ravine was fairly blocked with armed and painted warriors -- Sioux , of the Ogallalla tribe . There were not less than fifty of them . " You see my guards -- red devils , who will do my bidding at all times , and take a scalp on their own account every chance they get , " said Persimmon Bill . Then he took an eagle feather , with its tip dipped in crimson , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of all the Indians , to Jack . " Keep thus , and when out on the plains , wear it in your hat , where it can be seen , and the Sioux will ever pass you unharmed , and you can safely come and go among them . Now go back , get the list and all the news you can , and bring it here as soon as you can . Tell Addie to ride out with you when you come next . " Jack placed the feather in a safe place inside his vest , bowed his head , and wheeling his horse , turned toward the town . Before he had ridden a hundred yards he looked back . Persimmon Bill had vanished , not an Indian was in sight , and no one unacquainted with their vicinity could have seen a sign to show that such dangerous beings were near . No smoke rose above the trees , no horses were feeding around , nothing to break the apparent solitude of the scene . " And that was Persimmon Bill ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So handsome , it does not seem as if he could be the murderer they call him . And yet , if all is true , he has slain tens , where Wild Bill has killed one . No matter , he will be useful to me . That is all I care for now . " CHAPTER III . A WARNING . When Wild Bill and Sam Chichester entered the saloon alluded to in our first chapter , they were hailed by several jovial-looking men , one of whom Wild Bill warmly responded to as California Joe , while he grasped the hand of another fine-looking young man whom he called Captain Jack . " Come , Crawford , " said he , addressing the last named , " let 's wet up ! I 'm dry as an empty powder-horn ! " " No benzine for me , Bill , " replied Crawford , or " Captain Jack . " " I 've not touched a drop of the poison in six months . " " What ? Quit drinking , Jack ? Is the world coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that has nothing to do with my drinking . I promised old Cale Durg to quit , and I 've done it . And I never took a better trail in my life . I 'm fresh as a daisy , strong as a full-grown elk , and happy as an antelope on a wide range . " " All right , Jack . But I must drink . Come , boys -- all that will -- come up and wet down at my expense . " California Joe and most of the others joined in the invitation , and Captain Jack took a cigar rather than " lift a shingle from the roof , " as he said . " Where are you bound , Bill ? " asked Captain Jack , as Bill placed his empty glass on the counter , and turned around . " To the Black Hills with your crowd -- that is if I live to get there . " " Live ! You have n't any thought of dying , have you ? I never saw you look better . " " Then I 'll make a healthy-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly up ; I 've felt it in my bones this six months . I 've seen ghosts in my dreams , and felt as if they were around me when I was awake . It 's no use , Jack , when a chap 's time comes he has got to go . " " Nonsense , Bill ; do n't think of anything like that . A long life and a merry one -- that 's my motto . We 'll go out to the Black Hills , dig out our fortunes , and then get out of the wilderness to enjoy life . " " Boy , I 've never known the happiness outside of the wilderness that I have in it . What you kill there is what was made for killing -- the food we need . What one kills among civilization is only too apt to be of his own kind . " And Bill shuddered as if he thought of the many he had sent into untimely graves . " Stuff , Bill ! You 're half crazed by your dramatic trip . You 've acted so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to camp and have a talk about what is ahead of us . " " Not till I buy a horse , Jack . I want a good horse under me once more ; I 've ridden on cars and steamboats till my legs ache for a change . " " There 's a sale 's stable close by . Let 's go and see what stock is there , " said Sam Chichester . " Agreed ! " cried all hands , and soon Bill and his friends were at the stable , looking at some dozen or more horses which were for sale . " There 's the beauty I want , " said Wild Bill , pointing to a black horse , full sixteen hands high , and evidently a thoroughbred . " Name your price , and he is my meat ! " " That horse is n't for sale now . He was spoken for an hour ago , or maybe less by a cash customer of mine -- a red-haired chap from Texas . " " Red-haired chap from Texas ! " muttered Bill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That chap from Abilene was a Texas cattle-man , with hair as red as fire . Where is your cash customer , Mr. Liveryman ? " " Gone out riding somewhere , " replied the stable-keeper . " When he comes back , tell him Wild Bill wants that horse , and I reckon he 'll let Wild Bill buy him , if he knows when he is well off ! I would n't give two cusses and an amen for all the rest of the horses in your stable ; I want him ! " " I 'll tell Jack , " said the stableman ; " but I do n't think it will make much odds with him . He has as good as bought the horse , for he offered me the money on my price , but I could n't change his five hundred-dollar treasury note . It 'll take more than a name to scare him . He always goes fully armed . " " You tell him what I said , and that I 'm a-coming here at sunset for that horse , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crowd . An hour later the auburn-haired man from Texas reined in his own horse , a fiery mustang from his own native plains , in front of the stable . Though the horse was all afoam with sweat , showing that it had been ridden far and fast ; it did not pant or show a sign of weariness . It was of a stock which will run from rise of sun to its going down , and yet plunge forward in the chill of the coming night . " You want the Black Hawk horse you spoke for this morning , do n't you ? " asked the stableman , as Jack dismounted . " Of course I do . I 've got the change ; there is his price . Three hundred dollars you said ? " " Yes ; but there 's been a chap here looking at that horse who told me to tell you his name , and that he intended to take that horse . I told him a man had bought it , but he said : ' Tell him Wild Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset to take it . ' " " He will ? " It was hissed rather than spoken , while the young Texan 's face grew white as snow , his blue eyes darkening till they seemed almost black . " He will ! Let him try it ! A sudden death is too good for the blood-stained wretch ! But if he will force it on , why let it come . The horse is bought : let him come at sunset if he dares ! " And the young man handed the stable-keeper three one hundred-dollar greenback notes . CHAPTER IV . " GIVE UP THAT HORSE , OR DIE ! " Leaving the livery-stable , the young Texan went directly to the German restaurant , and asked for Willie Pond . He was shown up to the room , recently engaged by the traveler , and found him engaged in cleaning a pair of fine , silver mounted Remington revolvers . " Getting ready , I see , " said the Texan . " I have bought you a horse -- the best in this whole section ; I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep the two hundred to buy stores with for our trip , " said Pond . " No need of it I 've laid in all the stores we need . You can buy yourself a couple of blankets and an India-rubber for wet weather . A couple of tin cans of pepper and salt is all that I lay in when I 'm going to rough it on the plains . The man that ca n't kill all the meat he needs is n't fit to go there . " " Maybe you 're right . The less we are burdened the better for our horses . Are we likely to meet Indians on the route ? " " None that will hurt me -- or you , when you 're in my company . The Sioux know me and will do me no harm . " " That is good . The Indians were my only dread . " " I 've a favor to ask . " " It is granted before you ask it -- what is it ? " " I want to break your horse to the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the saddle , I reckon , as I am . I will take a ride at sunset , and bring him around here for you to look at . " " That is right . I am only thankful to have you ride him first , though you may find me a better rider than you think ! " " Perhaps . But he looks wild , and I like to tame wild uns . I 'll have him here between sundown and dark . " " All right . I told you I 'd see to getting arms . I had these revolvers , and cartridges for them , but I want a light repeating rifle . Get me a good one , with as much ammunition as you think I 'll need ! " " All right . I 'll get a now model Winchester . They rattle out lead faster than any other tool I ever carried . " The Texan now left . He had not spoken of Wild Bill 's desire to possess that horse , because he had an idea that Mr. Willie Pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than risk bloodshed for its possession . And perhaps he had another idea -- a mysterious one , which we do not care to expose at this stage of the story . This young Texan hastened from the German restaurant to a small , neat house in the outskirts of the town . Knocking in a very peculiar manner , he was admitted at once by a tall and strikingly beautiful young woman , whom he addressed as if well acquainted with her . " I 'm here , Addie , and I 've seen him . " " You found him all right , when you told him who sent you , did you not ? " asked the lady , leading the way to a sitting-room in the rear of the cottage . " Yes , ready to do anything for one you recommend . " " Poor Bill ! A braver man and a truer friend never lived . He loves me , and I fear it will be his ruin , for he will too often come within the reach of those who would destroy him , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cruelty placed him on the bloody path he has had to follow , and now -- now he is an outlaw , beyond all chance for mercy , should he ever be taken . " " He never will be taken , guarded as he is . " " You saw his guards , then ? " " Yes , forty or fifty of them , and I would rather have them as friends than foes . He wants you to ride out with me to meet him when I go next with some information that he needs . " " When will that be ? " asked the lady . " In the early morning , or perhaps to-night , if nothing happens to me between now and sunset to make it unnecessary ! " " Between now and sunset ? That is within two hours . Do you anticipate any danger ? " " Not much . I have a little task before me . I have a horse to break , and a man known as Will Bill to tame . " " Wild Bill !  - -  the dead-shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every year of his life ? " " Yes , the same . But ask me no more questions now . After I have tamed him I will report -- or , if he has settled me , there will be no need of it . " " Do not run this risk . " " It must be done . He has , in a manner , defied me , and I accept his defiance ! " " Surely he does not know -- - " " No , he knows nothing of what you would say if I did not interrupt you . Nor do I intend he shall at present . It is enough that you know it , and will care for both my body and my good name , should I fail . " " You know I will . But you must not fall . " " I do not intend to . I think I can crush him by a look and a word . I shall try , at least . If all goes well , I will be here by eight to-night to arrange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and safely . " " I will , Addie . Until the cup of vengeance is full . Heaven will surely spare me . But I must go . I have no time to spare . " The young Texan glanced at the chambers of a handsome six-shooter which he carried , to see if it was ready for use , replaced it in his belt , and then , with a cheerful smile , left the room and house . Hastening to the stable , he selected a saddle , lengthened the stirrups to suit himself , took a stout bridle from among a lot hanging in the store-room , and accompanied by the stable-keeper , approached the newly purchased Black Hawk horse . " I may as well have him ready , " he said ; " for if Wild Bill is to be here at sunset , that time is close at hand . You say the horse has not been ridden ? " " No , " said the stable-keeper . " My regular breaker was not here when I bought him . Black Joe tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I 'll soon see what he is made of , if I can get saddle and bridle on him , " said the Texan . They now together approached the large box stall in which the stallion was kept . The horse , almost perfect in symmetry , black as night , with a fierce , wild look , turned to front them as they approached the barred entrance . " Steady , boy -- steady ! " cried the Texan , as he sprang lightly over the bars , and at once laid his hand on the arched neck of the horse . To the wonder of the stableman , the horse , instead of rearing back or plunging at the intruder , turned his eyes upon him , and with a kind of tremor in his frame , seemed to wait to see what his visitor meant . " So ! Steady , Black Hawk ! steady , old boy ! " continued the Texan , kindly passing his hand over the horse 's neck and down his face . The horse uttered a low neigh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That beats me ! " cried the stable-keeper . " Old Joe had to lasso him and draw him down to a ringbolt before he could rub him off . " " Hand me the saddle and bridle , " said the Texan , still continuing to " pet " the beautiful and spirited animal . In a few seconds , without difficulty , the same kind and skillful hands had the horse both saddled and bridled . The Texan now led the horse out on the street , where quite a crowd seemed to be gathering , perhaps drawn there by some rumor of a fight in embryo . And as he glanced up the street the Texan saw Wild Bill himself , with his six-shooters in his belt , come striding along , with California Joe and a dozen more at his heels . In a second , the Texan vaulted upon the back of the horse , which made one wild leap that would have unseated most riders , and then reared on its hind legs as if it would fall back and crush its would-be master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol in hand , shouted : " Give up that horse , or die ! " CHAPTER V. A SQUARE BACK-DOWN . The Texan paid no heed to the words of the desperado , but bending forward on the horse with his full weight , drove his spurs deeply into its flanks . Startled and stung with pain , the noble animal , at one wild bound , leaped far beyond where Bill and his friends stood , and in a second more sped in terrific leaps along the street . " The cowardly cuss is running away ! " yelled Bill derisively . " It is false ! He is no coward ! He will tame the horse first and then you ! " cried a voice so close that Bill turned in amazement to see who dare thus to speak to him , the " Terror of the West . " " A woman ! " he muttered , fiercely , as he saw a tall and queenly-looking girl standing there , with flashing eyes , which did not drop at his gaze . " Yes -- a woman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admires him ! " she said , undauntedly . " Is the fellow that rode off on the horse your husband or lover that you take his part ? " asked Bill , half angrily and half wondering at the temerity of the lovely girl who thus braved his anger . " He is neither , " she replied , scornfully . " I 'm glad of it . I shall not make you a widow or deprive you of a future husband when he comes under my fire , if he should be fool enough to come back . " " He comes now . See for yourself . He has tamed the horse -- now comes your turn , coward and braggart ! " Bill was white with anger ; but she was a woman , mind no matter what he felt , too well he knew the chivalry of the far West to raise a hand or even speak a threatening word to her . But he heard men around him murmur her name . It was Addie Neidic . And then he turned his eyes upon the black horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though flecked with foam , came down the street slowly and gently , bearing his rider with an air of pride rather than submission . As he passed the German restaurant , the rider raised his hat in salutation to Willie Pond , who stood in his window , and said , in a cheerful voice : " Remain in your room . I have news for you and will be there soon . " Without checking his horse the rider kept on until he was within half a length of the horse of Wild Bill , then checking the animal , he said , in a mocking tone : " You spoke to me just as I rode away . I 've come back to hear you out . " What was the matter with Wild Bill ? He stood staring wildly at the Texan , his own face white as if a mortal fear had come upon him . " Where have I seen that face before ? " he gasped . " Can the dead come back to life ? " The Texan bent forward till his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word in a shrill whisper : " Sister ! " It was all he said , but the instant Wild Bill heard it , he shrieked out : " ' T is him -- 'tis him I shot at Abilene ! " and with a shuddering groan he sank senseless to the pavement . In an instant Bill 's friends , who had looked in wonder at this strange scene , sprang to his aid , and , lifting his unconscious form , carried it into the saloon where Bill had met Californian Joe , Captain Jack , and the rest of their crowd . Left alone , the young Texan said a few words to Addie Neidic , then dismounted and told the stable-keeper to keep that horse saddled and bridled , and to get his own Texan mustang ready for use . " I must be out of town before sunrise , or Wild Bill and his friends may have questions to ask that I do n't want to answer just now , " he said . And then , he walked a little way with Miss Neidic , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept on in the direction of her own house , he turned and went to the German restaurant . Entering the room of Willie Pond , he said , abruptly : " If you want to go to the Black Hills with me on your own horse we 'll have to leave this section mighty sudden . Wild Bill has set his mind on having the horse I bought and broke for you , and he has a rough crowd to back him up . " " If I had known Bill wanted the horse so badly I could have got along with another , " said Pond , rather quietly . " What ! let him have the horse ? Why it has n't its equal on the plains or in the mountains . It is a thoroughbred -- a regular racer , which a sporting man was taking through to the Pacific coast on speculation . He played faro , lost , got broke , and put the horse up for a tenth of its value . I got him for almost nothing compared to his worth . On that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red who scours the plains . If you do n't want him I do , for Wild Bill shall never put a leg over his back ! " " I 'll keep him . Do n't get mad . I 'll keep him and go whenever you are ready , " said Pond , completely mastered by the excitement which this young Texan exhibited . " Well , we 'll get the horses out of town and in a safe place to-night . And for yourself , I 'll take you to the house of a lady friend of mine to stay to-night and to-morrow , and by to-morrow night I 'll know all I want to about the movements of the other party , and we can move so as to be just before or behind them , as you and I will decide best . " " All right , Jack . I leave it to you . Are you sure the horse will be safe for me to ride ? " " Yes . A horse like that once broken is broken for life . They never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentful , and tricky , is different . Be ready to mount when I lead him around , I will send for your traveling-bag , and you will find it at the house where we stop . " " I will be ready , " said Pond . The Texan now left , and Pond watched him as he hurried off to the stable . " The man hates Wild Bill with a deadly hatred ! " he murmured . " I must learn the cause . Perhaps it is a providence that I have fallen in with him , and I have concluded to keep his company to the Black Hills . But I must call the landlord and close up my account before the other comes back with the horses . " The German was so put out by the sudden giving up of a room , which he hoped to make profitable , that he asked an extra day 's rent , and to his surprise , got it . CHAPTER VI . OFF TO THE HILLS . It was some time before Wild Bill became fully conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did come to he raved wildly about the red-haired man he shot in Abilene , and insisted it was his ghost , and not a real man , he had seen . Bill 's friends tried to cheer and reassure him , and got several stiff draughts of liquor down his throat , which finally " set him up . " as they said , till he began to look natural . But he still talked wildly and strangely . " I told you , Joe , " he said to his old friend ; " I told you my time was nigh up . This has n't been my first warning . That Abilene ghost has been before me a thousand times , and he has hissed that same word , ' sister , ' in my ear . " " Bah ! old boy . What 's the use of your talking foolish . You 've seen no ghost . That red-haired chap was as live as you are . " " He did have red hair and blue eyes , then ? " " Yes ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red hair and blue eyes generally travel in company . But he was nothing to scare you . You could have wiped him out with one back-handed blow of your fist , let alone usin ' shootin ' irons , of which there was n't ' casion , seein ' he did n't draw . " " Where is he now ? " " I 'll go and see . I suppose he is over at the stable . " Joe went out , but soon returned to say that the Texan had just ridden off , after paying his bill ; the stable-keeper did not know where . " Let him go , " murmured Bill . " If he is a man , and not a ghost , I would n't raise a hand to hurt him , not for all the gold in the Black Hills . He was so like -- so like the chap I dropped in Abilene ! " Bill took another drink , but it seemed as if nothing could lift the gloom which weighed down his heart . Only once did his face brighten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging on at Laramie any longer for a bigger crowd ; they were strong enough now , and would start for the Hills inside of four-and-twenty hours . " That 's the talk for me ! " cried Bill . " I want to get out of here as soon as I can , Joe , and pick me out some sort of a horse . I do n't care what , so it 'll carry me to the Hills , I ca n't breathe free any longer where there 's such a lot of folks . " " I 'll get you a first-chop horse , Bill , " said Joe . " There 's some half-breeds in a corral just out of town , as tough as grizzlies , and heavy enough for your weight or mine . " " I do n't weigh down , as I did , " said Bill , with a sigh . " I 've been losin ' weight for six months back . No matter . It 'll be less trouble to tote me when I go under . Remember , boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , just as I die . " " Stop your clatter about dyin ' , Bill . I 'm sick o ' that kind of talk . It 's time enough to talk of death when its clutch is on you . " " I ca n't help it , Joe , old pard . It keeps a stickin ' in my throat , and if it did n't come out , I 'd choke . " " Let 's go to camp , " said Chichester . " Can you walk now , Bill ? ' " Yes . " And the party rose , took a parting drink with the landlord , and started for camp . Outside , Bill gave a startled , wild glance toward the spot where he had seen the Texan ; but no one was there now , and he moved on with his companions toward their camp , listening to , but not joining in their conversation . On arriving at camp , Chichester , as captain , gave orders that each man should report on paper , or verbally , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , the number and kind of his arms , private stores , etc. , so that if there was not enough to make the trip safely , more could be provided . The number and condition of horses , pack-mules , etc. , was also to be given . No man would be fitted to lead such a party did he not consider and post himself fully in all these particulars . Quite a crowd of townspeople followed the party out , for the news soon spread that they intended to leave in a short time ; so around their blazing camp-fire there were many visitors . Toward these Wild Bill cast many a stealthy glance , but he did not see the red-haired Texan there . CHAPTER VII . THE OUTLAW 'S LOVE . Willie Pond was much surprised when he found that his ride only extended to a small but pretty cottage just on the outskirts of the town , where the young Texan , introducing him to Miss Neidic as his temporary hostess , left him while he took the horses to a safe place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor into the rear sitting-room , and while giving him a cordial welcome , and passing the usual salutations , scanned him with a keen and critical eye . The impression left must have been rather favorable , for the lady seemed to feel none of the embarrassment usual when strangers held a first interview , but talked on as easily and naturally as if she had known him half a lifetime . " How long have you been in town , Mr. Pond ? " was one of her many questions . " Only a day . I arrived on the express , westward bound , which passed this morning , " was the answer . " Why , that was the same train the desperado , Wild Bill came on . " " Yes , he was pointed out to me by the conductor . But why do you call him a desperado ? " " Because that is his character . " " I thought none but outlaws were celled desperadoes . " " There is where the mistake comes in . Most outlaws are desperadoes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outlaw . If to be always ready to shoot for a look or a word -- whether his opponent is ready or not -- is not being a desperado . I do not know what is . But excuse me . He may be a friend of yours . " " Oh , no , " said Pond , with some confusion in his manner . " But a very dear friend of mine married him not long since , and for her sake I feel a sort of interest in the man . I fancied that he was rather wild when under the influence of liquor , but for all , a brave and generous man , when truly himself . " " Brave , as brutes are , when he feels he has the power to kill in his hands ; but generous ? Never ! " said Miss Neidic . " You are his enemy . " " No ; for he has never done me , personally , an injury ; but he has injured friends of mine -- sent more than one down to untimely graves . " " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has done to your friends . " I am not his friend , nor do I wish to be the friend of such a man . But the enmity of a woman is nothing to him . He looks for friends among such men as he now consorts with -- California Joe , Sam Chichester , and that crowd . I know but one real gentleman in the party , and that one is Jack Crawford . " " I know none of them . " " You lose nothing , then , for it is little honor one gains by such acquaintances . They suit Wild Bill , for they drink , gamble , and shoot on little cause ; they are ready for any adventure , never stopping to count risks or look back when evil is commenced or ruin wrought , no matter what may be its nature . " The entrance of the young Texans now caused a change in the topic of conversation . " I have learned when that party start . " he said . " They are making their final preparations to-night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-mills Creek for their first night 's halt -- probably about ten o'clock . " " Do you propose to go ahead of them ? " asked Pond . " No ; it will be more easy and safe to fellow their trail . They will not have over fifty animals all told , and there will be lots of feed left for us even if we keep close by . And we can get as much game as we need any time , for we can use but little . One pack horse will carry all our stuff , and still be able to travel at speed , if need be . " " You understand it better than I , " said Pond . " Arrange things to suit yourself , and I will conform to your plans . " " All right . You had better turn in early , so as to get a good rest . For after we are out , long rides and night-watches will tell on you , for you are not used to them . " " I will show you to a chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Neidic . Mr. Pond followed her , and the Texan was left alone to his thoughts , which he carelessly expressed aloud . " So far all works well , " he said . " Mr. Willie Pond is as soft as mush ; but I 've read him through and through . He would n't go with me if he did n't think he 'd have a chance to serve Wild Bill , for , though he shuns Bill , he thinks more of Bill than he would have me think , I 'll bet Addie has found that out . " " Found out what ? " said the lady herself , who had returned so noiselessly that Jack had not heard her . " That Mr. Pond , as he calls himself , is a friend of Wild Bill 's . " " All of that , and maybe something more , as you may find out before you are through your trip . " " What do you mean ? " " Nothing but this -- keep your eyes open , and study your Mr. Pond closely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Neidic laughed heartily . " Nothing very dangerous to you , at any rate , " she said ; " but if they all go in the morning , we must see Persimmon Bill to-night . " " That is so . Shall I bring the horses round ? " " No . We might be overheard . I will go to the stables . Get the horses ready . I have some things to put up for Bill , and I will come as soon as I pack them in a pair of saddle-bags . " Jack now left for the stable , and Miss Neidic , with a woman 's forethought , began to gather up many little things which might be useful to her outlaw lover , who had little chance to procure articles of comfort , not to speak of luxury , except when on some raid in the settlements . In ten minutes she was ready and on her way to the stables . Jack had her own favorite horse saddled , while for himself he chose the Black Hawk beauty . In a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sped away over the same route which Jack had taken when he went to visit Persimmon Bill . Little was said as they rode on , for the horses were kept at a swift gallop , and before the hour was up they had approached the ravine as near as they deemed safe before giving the signal . Scarcely was it given before it was answered , and a second later Persimmon Bill himself was by the side of Addie Neidic 's horse , and she was pressed to the outlaw 's bosom with a fervor that showed he had a heart more than half-human left in his breast . " It 's kind of you , Addie , to come out here in the chill of the night to see a wild cuss like me , outlawed by man , and forsaken by Heaven ! " " It 's safer to come by night than by day , for you and for me , Bill , " she said . " And I could n't bear you should go away again till I had seen you . And I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . " " I shall not need much of anything , Addie , on the trail I 'm soon to take . Your friend here I know is safe , or I would n't say so much . But the truth is , the reds are going to rise in a body all over the north and northwest , and we 'll sweep the Black Hills , and clean out every ' blue-coat ' that is sent to check the rising . The Sioux have made me a big chief , and I 'll have my hands full . If you hear of the ' White Elk , ' as second only to Sitting Bull himself , you 'll know who it is . " " You , of course ! " " Yes , Addie ; that is the name they have given me . And if the Sioux fight as I think they will , and all the northern tribes join , we 'll force a treaty that will give us all the Black Hills and the Yellowstone , Powder River , and Big Horn Country for ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , can I make a safe home for you , and not till then will I ask you to be my wife . For then the outlaw will be safe , and can live in peace , and look for days of home and happiness . " " Bill , when you ask it , be it in peace or war , I am yours . You are brave as the bravest , and had you never been treated wrongfully , would not now be a hunted outlaw . I love you , and you know it . " " Yes , Addie , and I love you too well to ask you to share my lot till I can see some sunshine . But this stranger has news for me . " Persimmon Bill turned to the Texan , who had drawn his horse away a little , so as not to intrude on the conversation between the lovers . " I have the news you asked for , " said Jack . " The party , all told , who will start at nine or ten in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-nine men , all well armed , the most of them with repeating rifles and six-shooters . Half of them are old scouts , the rest are miners , gamblers , and a couple of them are traders . They have fifty animals , saddle and pack , and carry no wagons . The mules are loaded pretty heavy , at least them that belong to the traders , and are well worth capture . " " All right , And there is one of the party you do n't want hurt until he is in your hands ? " " Yes , that man is Wild Bill . I want him in my power so that I may see him die slowly , surely , awfully ! " " There is another man in that party , Bill , who must n't be hurt . He did me a kindness once , down at Cheyenne -- saved me from insult and wrong . His name is Crawford -- Captain Jack , they call him ! " " Yes , I know him . No harm shall befall him , if I can help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be jealous of him , for it is only what he did that makes me ask a favor for him ! " " I know it , Addie . " " No woman on earth can make me jealous of you . I 've too much confidence in your truth and love . But you 'll not attack the party anywhere near here ? " " No , not till they are far beyond all the military posts . I want no pursuit when I do my work . Our animals are in good order for the war-path now , and I want to keep them so . I 'm drilling my braves at every chance , so as to fit them to meet such men as Crook , Custer , and Carr . All they want is drill and discipline to make them the best soldiers in the world , and they 're coming into it finely . " " Well , you were a soldier yourself long enough to know all that should be done . " " A soldier too long , girl -- too long a slave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bill , in a bitter tone . " The cruelty exercised on me then turned my best blood to gall , and made me what I am . I hate the name , and my blood boils beyond all restraint when my eye falls upon a uniform . Rightly have the Sioux called me the " Soldier Killer , " for never do I let one who wears the button escape if he comes within my reach . But you must not stay too long . Good-night -- I will not say good-by , for we will meet again . " " Good-night , Bill . " " One word to your friend here , " added the outlaw . " Follow the trail of Chichester , about three hours back , whenever he moves . I will probably , for three or four days , be about as far behind you . On the night of the third or fourth day out , or , if it is bad weather for travel , a day or two later , I will surround you , and take you and your friend prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come to you , and you will be free when the other work is done . Then I will close up and wipe out Chichester 's gang , saving the two who are to be spared . Then I will be ready for the war-path , for I need the arms and ammunition these people have to finish arming the drilled marines who are specially under me . " " All right , sir ; we understand each other , " said the Texan , wheeling his horse to take the back trail . Addie Neidic , as if from some uncontrollable reason , turned once more toward her lover , and bending from her saddle , threw her arms about his tall and splendid form , and kissed him again and again with passionate tenderness . " Do be careful of your life , dear Bill , " she said . " You are all in all to me . If you perish , life will be valueless to me . " " Addie , I 'll try to live for your sake , and work my uttermost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end . Good-night , once more good-night , my beautiful , my own . " " Good night , Bill -- God bless you ! " she sobbed ; as she turned her horse , and followed the Texan at a gallop . CHAPTER VIII . FOILED BY A WOMAN . It was their last night in town before breaking up camp , and the Black Hillers , as they already called themselves , under Chichester , were determined to have a lively time of it . They commenced " wetting up , " or pouring down liquid lightning in camp , but , being reminded that what they used there would be missed on their journey , they started to skin the saloons in town , and finish out their spree where it would not diminish their own stores . As Wild Bill said , they were going where money would be of little account , if all the stories about the gold to be found were true ; so what they spent now they would n't have to carry . And they went in , as such reckless men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , and drinking with a " looseness " that promised headaches on the morrow , if nothing more . Wild Bill went in on the spree with a rush , as if he wished to drown the remembrance of his late fright , and despite the cautions of his friend , Captain Jack , who strove hard to keep him within bounds . California Joe of course was in his element , and in a little while all the party became so turbulent that Crawford left them in disgust . For , as Addie Neidic had said of him , despite his associations , he was a gentleman . By midnight every saloon had been visited , and many of them pretty well cleaned out , and now Bill proposed to go and break a faro bank that some of the party spoke of . " I have seven hundred dollars left out of a thousand my woman gave me before I started , " said he . " I 'll lose that , or break the bank ; see if I do n't . " All of the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was before the green board . Without even waiting to get the run of the game , be planked a hundred dollars on the king , and lost . Without a word , he put two hundred dollars more on the same card , and won . He left the four hundred down , and in another turn he had eight hundred . " Luck is with me , boys ! " He shouted . " I 'll break the bank ! Let her swing for the king once more , Mr. Dealer ! " To the wonder of all , though it was the last turn of the cards , the king won , and Wild Bill picked up sixteen hundred dollars . His friends now urged him to quit , but the demon of the game had entered his soul , and he swore , with a terrible oath , that he would play till he broke the bank , or was broke himself . A new pack was now put in the box , and once more the dealer cried out : " Make your bets gentlemen -- make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a reckless bravado , as much of rum as of his own nature , again laid all his winnings on one card -- this time the queen . And with wonderful luck -- it could be nothing else -- he again doubled his pile , this time his gains being thirty-two hundred dollars . " Stop now , Bill ! " cried California Joe , " This ca n't last ! " " It shall last ! The bank ca n't stand more than two more such pulls ! " shouted Bill , wildly . And again on the same card he staked his entire winnings . The dealer and banker were one ; he turned pale , but when all bets were down , he pulled his cards without a tremor in his hand . But a groan broke from his lips as the queen once more came out on the winning side . Once more Bill 's stakes were doubled , and this time he changed his card . The banker hesitated . His capital would hardly cover the pile if Bill won again . " Keep on , " whispered a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll stake your bank . " The banker looked up and saw , though she was disguised in male attire , a face he well knew . It was that of Addie Neidic , and he knew she was able to keep her word . Wild Bill had heard the whisper , and his face was white with rage , for he thought the bank would succumb before it would risk another chance with his wonderful luck . But he let his money lay where he put it , and cried out to the banker to go on with his game if he dared . The latter ; with firm set lips , cried out : " Game ready , gentlemen -- game ready . " The cards were drawn , and once more Wild Bill had won . Coolly , as if money was no more than waste paper , Bill gathered up the pile , and began to thrust it away in his pockets , when the disguised woman , Addie Neidic , thrust a roll of thousand dollar notes into the hands of the banker , and cried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let no braggart go away and say he has bluffed the bank , till he breaks it ! " Wild Bill trembled from head to foot . " I know you ! " he hissed . " You are the woman who bluffed me at the livery-stable . I 'll win your fifty thousand dollars , and then blow the top of any man 's head off who 'll take your part ! " " Play , do n't boast ; put up your money ! " was the scornful reply . In an instant Bill put every dollar he had won , every cent he had in the world , and a gold watch on top of that , on the Jack . Not another man around the table made a bet . A pin could have been heard , had it fallen to the floor , so complete was the silence . The banker cried out , " Game ready , " and slowly drew the cards . " Jack loses ! " he cried , a second after , and Bill 's pile , watch and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , you shall die for this ! " he shouted , and his hand went to his belt . But even as his hand touched his pistol , he heard that fearful whisper , " sister , " and saw a white face , wreathed in auburn hair rise over Addie Neidic 's shoulder , and with a groan , or a groaning cry of terror , he fell back insensible to the floor . CHAPTER IX . THE GHOST AGAIN APPEARS . When Wild Bill fell , the banker declared his game closed for the night ; and while Bill 's friends gathered about him and sought to bring him to , the woman , Addie Neidic , took up her money , and left by the rear entrance , and the banker , with two or three of his friends , escorted her home , fearing Bill and his gang might annoy her , if the latter came to before she reached her residence . The auburn-haired Texan did not go with her , but with a slouched hat drawn over his head , and a Mexican blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobserved , to hear Bill 's words when he came to , and to see what next would appear on the desperado 's programme . " That ghost again ! He came to break my luck . " These were the last words that Wild Bill spoke , when recovering his consciousness ; he glared out upon the crowd with bloodshot eyes . " It was a woman who broke your luck . Addie Neidic backed the bank , or ' t would have given in , " cried another . " Who is Addie Neidic ? " asked Bill , with a wondering gaze . " Oh ! I remember -- the woman who called me a coward over at the livery-stable . Who is she ? Where does she live ? " " In a cottage west of town . They say she 's rich ! Let 's go and clean out her crib ! " cried a ruffian who did not belong to Bill 's party , but most likely held some spite against Miss Neidic . " Ay ! That 's the word ! Let 's clean out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a chum of the first speaker . It required but a leader now to set the vile work going . And Wild Bill , gradually recovering his reason , but mad with drink , and just realizing that every dollar he had , and even his watch was gone , was just the man for such a leader . " I 'll go ! Show me the house , and we 'll teach her to wear her own clothes , and let men 's games alone ! " shouted Wild Bill . In a moment fifty men were ready to go ; but first they made an onslaught on the wines and liquors on the sideboard of the gambling-room . While they were madly pouring these down , the auburn-haired Texan slipped from the room , and ran swiftly to the cottage of his fair friend . " Addie , " he cried , as she opened the door to his signal , " Wild Bill and a crowd of full fifty men are coming here to rob you , and burn your house . They are mad with drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we three can hardly hold them at bay , no matter how well we are armed . " " We will not try it ! " said Addie , calmly . " I had about made up my mind to go with Persimmon Bill . He loves me so well that I ought to be able and willing to bear hardship for his sake . I care little for the house and furniture , though they are mine , and cost me a large sum . I have money and jewelry that we can carry off . I will rouse my two servants while you call your friend , and we will all be out of the house before they come . No one but you knows where your horses are kept . Let that be the place of rendezvous , and before daylight we will be safe with my lover . " " No ; I do not want to be with him yet , Addie . I will take this newly found friend and see you safely in reach of Bill , but we will make camp elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his trail , and you on ours , as it was agreed upon . " " As you , like , Jack . But we must hurry . " " All right -- as soon as I bring my friend down , do you go with him and your servants to the stable , carrying off what you can . Leave me here , for I want to give Wild Bill one more good scare . " " As you please , but be careful he do n't kill you while you scare him . Ah ! I hear their yells . We must be quick . " Willie Pond had a white , scared face when he came from his chamber , for while the Texan told him of the danger , the yells and shouts of the drunken ruffians who were approaching could be plainly heard . It seemed as if a gang of demons from the lower regions had been let loose on earth . " Come with me , " cried Addie Neidic , as Mr. Pond came down with his valise in hand . " Be quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pond , seemingly dazed and bewildered , obeyed , and out by a rear door hastened the fair owner of the doomed house , with her maid , or man-servant , and Willie Pond , while the Texan , telling them he soon would follow , remained . Plainly now the shouts and vile threats of the drunken marauders came to the ears of the single listener . " I wish I had a barrel or two of gunpowder here , " he muttered . " I 'd make them sing another tune . " Nearer and nearer they came , and now the Texan extinguished every light but one , which he shaded with his hat . Then he looked to the front door and windows and saw that they were all barred , except a single shutter which he left so he could open it . A minute later , and the tramp of a hundred hurrying feet came loudly on his ear . Then shouts : " Clean her out . Kill her and burn her crib ! " In a minute the crowd brought up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or we 'll shatter them ! " cried Wild Bill . " Open , or down goes everything ! " shouted the crowd . " Here , Bill ; here is a shutter loose ! " cried one . Wild Bill sprang toward it , and as he did so the shutter flew open ; he saw a white face surrounded by auburn hair ; he heard one gasping cry --  " sister "  - -  and he fell back in terror , crying out : " The ghost ! the ghost ! " But some one fired a shot , the light went out , and all was dark where the light had been . Bill recovered from his shock almost as soon as he felt it , and joined with the shout : " Down with the doors ! Down with the doors . " The crash that followed , told that the frail obstacles had given way , and Bill cried out : " In and clean the crib out . Ghost or no ghost , give us light , and clean the crib out ! " Cheer after cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , torches made from splintered doors and shutters , blazed in a dozen hands as the ruffians ran to and for in search of plunder . " The ghost . Find the ghost , or the woman ! " yelled Bill . CHAPTER X. A MYSTERY . The excited and ruffianly crowd dashed to and fro , overturning the furniture , tearing aside curtains , and looking for plunder , but unable to find anything of value , beyond the furniture , or to see a single living person under the roof . Not a dollar in money , not a piece of plate rewarded their search . " Fire the crib ! fire the crib ! " came from fifty throats , and almost as soon as spoken , the act was consummated . Wild Bill , angered to find no one on whom to vent his wrath , or shake his thirst for revenge , looked on the blaze as it rose with gloomy satisfaction , muttering that he only wished the witch of a woman was burning in it . The crowd increased as the flames rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and soon it was but a smoldering mass of ruins where the pretty cottage had stood . But the late occupant , unharmed , was a mile away , and having just paid off and discharged her faithful servants , was on the point of mounting to ride off with the Texan and Mr. Pond , when the last shout of the dispersing crowd reached her ears . She smiled when she heard it , and said : " I can afford all the harm they have done , I led but a lonesome life there . I feel that the change I am about to make will be for the better . " The three , with two loaded horses besides those they rode , now moved quietly but swiftly out of the suburbs of the town , where the horses had been stabled , and with the Texan leading the way , steered to the westward , having no compass but the stars . For an hour the three rode on , and then , pointing to some timber ahead , the Texan said : " Addie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek . Tell him I have not altered any of my plans , and that I shall lay in camp to-morrow at Lone-tree Spring , an hour 's gallop south of the Twenty-mile Creek . The next morning I will follow the trail we spoke of . And now , Addie , good-by , and do n't forgot me . " " You know I will not , I hope yet to see you happy , and to be happier than I am now . We shall meet again , perhaps , Mr. Pond , but good-night for now . " And while the Texan and Mr. Pond remained still on their horses , she rode on , leading one pack-horse , toward a growth of trees seen dimly ahead . The Texan remained where he was until he heard her give the signal and receive an answer , and then turning to Pond , he said : " She is safe ; we may as well move on . We have a long ride to where I intend to camp . " " All right , " said the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . I can hardly realize that Wild Bill would lead such a disgraceful crowd of ruffians , and do such a dastardly act as to burn a woman out of house and home . " " Rum takes all the man out of those who use it , " said the Texan . " I use it myself sometimes , I know , but it is when I feel as if I was all giving out , and could n't go through what was before me . And I feel abashed when I think I need such a stimulant to fire up my flagging nature . " Pond made no reply , but rode on thoughtfully at the rapid pace which the other led , the pack animal keeping close in the rear . At last he asked : " Who did Miss Neidic expect to meet where we left her ? " " A brave man who loves her dearly , but who has been driven in his desperation by cruel injustice to do some work which keeps him outside of towns and settlements for the present . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share his dangers and his hardships . " " None can tell but those who test it , how deeply , how entirely , and how lasting a true woman loves , " said Pond , with a sigh . " And none but a woman wronged can tell how bitterly she can hate ! " said the other , as he dashed his spurs into his horse and galloped on . Miles were swiftly passed over , and the gray of dawn was just beginning to soften night 's darkness in the east , when the Texan exclaimed : " Here we are ; now for a rest of one day , at least . " And as he spoke he drew up his horse by the side of a small pool of water , which trickled out from under the roots of a single large tree . For an acre or so around it there were bushes growing as high as the horses , but when light came , no other growth but that of short buffalo grass and prickly cactus could be seen . The Texan unsaddled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his saddle ungirthed . Then the Texan sprang to his assistance , finished stripping the horse , and with a long lariat picketed it out in the best grass . His own horses he turned loose , saying they never would stray from camp . Then , taking his rifle , he stepped out from camp , saying he was going after meat . In fifteen or twenty minutes , Pond heard the crack of his rifle and in less than half an hour the young man was back , with the fat saddle of a young antelope on his shoulder . " Here is meat enough for to-day and to-morrow , " he said . " Next day we will be on buffalo ground , and we 'll have some hump ribs to roast . " Gathering a few dry , light sticks , he soon had a hot and almost smokeless fire ablaze . On the coals of this he set his coffee-pot , broiled some meat , and while Mr. Pond looked on in surprise , he quickly had a nice breakfast of antelope steak , coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack . While Pond took hold and ate heartily , praising the food by his actions much as his words , the Texan ate lightly , yet all that he wanted -- not touching the bread , but using meat entirely . " There 'll be the more left for you , " said he , when Pond noticed that he ate no bread . " I never care for anything but meat on the plains . It gives bone and muscle , and that is what we need here . The more simple the food , the better the health . We use ourselves to salt , but we would be just as well off without it . Eat hearty , and take a good nap . We have nothing to do to-day . The party whose trail will be our guide to the " Hills " will not start till late . We shall not move until to-morrow morning , and then I 'll show you the coals of the camp-fire which they 'll light to-night . There will be no need for any shelter but this tree overhead . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this for a couple on the plains . The water is good , feed plenty , and we do n't require much fire this time of year . " Pond , tired and sleepy , was only too glad to take the Texan 's advice , so he spread his blanket , lay down , and soon was in the land of dreams . Meantime the Texan , with a small field-glass in his hand , mounted the tree , and from a perch on its uppermost limbs , scanned the prairie in all directions , but most often in the direction from which they had come . Nothing was in sight but wild game , scattered here and there , and he soon came down and prepared to take a rest on his own account . " They 'll not pass till afternoon , " he muttered , " and I may as well rest a few hours while I can in peace and safety . " He took a long and curious look at the form of his sleeping traveling companion , and a strange smile flitted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I can solve it . " CHAPTER XI . IN THE WILDS . If ever a man was astonished , when he responded to that after midnight signal at the mouth of Dead Man 's Hollow , it was the outlaw , Persimmon Bill . He came from his place of concealment expecting to meet the Texan with news , and found instead Addie Neidic , and with her , on a pack horse , all the wealth and apparel she had in the world . " Addie , love , what does this mean ? " he cried , as she sprang from the horse and threw herself into his arms . " It means this , Bill . I have come to stay with you , go where you go , live as you live , and die where you die ! " " Addie , dearest , did I not tell you to wait till I could give you a home in peace and quietness ! " " Yes , Bill , but there were those that would not let me wait . To-night , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have been murdered by a mob of drunken ruffians led on by Wild Bill . Warned in time , I escaped with all that I had worth saving , except my house and furniture . Those they burned ; I saw the blaze from my stable , where I went to get my horses to come to you . " " By all that 's fiendish , this is more than I can bear ! I 'll ride in with my Sioux and burn the cursed town ! " " No , Bill ; for my sake keep cool and hear me . I am glad it is done . I was wretched and lonely there -- how lonely no words may tell . I was in constant anxiety on your account . I trembled daily , hourly , lest I should hear of your death or capture . Now I shall be with you , know of your safety , or if you are in peril , share the danger with you . " " But , Addie , you can never endure the privations and the fatigue of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must be on a bloody war-path . We will have regular troops to meet , great battles to fight . " " And it will be my glory and pride to be with you in all your perils -- to show your red allies what a pale-faced woman dares and can do for him whom she loves . " " Dearest , I see not how it can be helped . But I grieve to see you suffer . " " Do not grieve , my love , while my face is bright with smiles . Do not let your heart be heavy while mine is full of joy . Think but this -- I am thine until death . We will never part while life thrills our veins . Your triumphs shall be mine ; I will glory in your courage , and in your enterprise . I have arms and well know their use . No warrior in all your following can ride better than I. That I am fearless I really believe , for twice inside of ten hours have I defied Wild Bill in his anger , and laughed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your camp . I am tired , and the night air is chilly ; and take care of the pack horse . My silver and over one hundred thousand dollars in money is on his back , and what clothing I shall need for a time . " " You bring a rich dowry , Addie , but your love is worth more than all the treasures the world could show . Come , darling , I will take you as the most precious gift a wild , bad man ever received . " " You are not bad , Bill . You are my hero and my love ! " Bill could only press his answer on her lips , and then with the bridle of her horses in his hand , and her arm linked in his , he walked back up the winding bed of the ravine for near a quarter of a mile . Then he emerged into an open space where there were full a hundred Indian ponies staked out , with their owners lying in groups about near small smoldering camp-fires . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white chief appear paid no apparent attention to the companion , though they doubtless saw her . It is the Indian 's nature to be stoical and never to manifest surprise , no matter what occurs . Inside the line where the ponies were staked was a small brush house , and in front of this Bill halted with his led horses , with his own hands unsaddled one and unpacked the other , leaving packs and saddles in front of the house . Well he knew they were as safe there as they would have been behind bolts and bars in the settlements -- even more safe . " Come in , my love , " he said . " The Sioux will care for the horses . Come in and receive the best a fond heart can give in the way of shelter and comfort . " " It is all I ask , " she murmured , as with him she entered the " Outlaw 's Home . " CHAPTER XII . ON THE TRAIL . It was high noon when the young Texan woke up and when he rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he rose and bathed his face in the limpid water , for the beard of the sleeper had got all awry , showing that it was false . " No need for a disguise here , " said the Texan . " But let him keep it up . When the time comes I 'll read him a lesson . " Cutting some antelope stakes , the Texan built up a smokeless fire , and had them nicely broiled when Willie Pond woke up . " Mercy ! how I have slept ! " he said , as he looked at the sun , already fast declining toward the west . " You are not used to passing sleepless nights , " said the Texan . " When we are fairly launched into the Indian country you may not sleep so sound . Take hold and eat . A hearty eater on the plains generally stands travel best . To-morrow , it is likely , we 'll have a fifty-mile ride or more , if those Black Hillers get sobered down to their work . They 'll do well if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed his face and hands in the limpid water before eating , and as he expressed it , " rubbed the sleep " out of his eyes ; then he went at the toothsome steak with appetite not at all impaired by the pure open air he was breathing . The meal , taken with comfort and deliberation , occupied a half hour or more , and as there were no dishes to wash , " clearing up things " only consisting in tossing the bones out of the way , wiping their knives on a bunch of grass , scouring them with a plunge or two in the dry sand , they were all ready for next meal-time . " Your horse hears something , so does mine , " said the Texan , pointing to the animals , which suddenly stopped feeding , and with their ears pricked forward , looked off to the east-ward . " I can see nothing . What can alarm them ! " said Pond . " They hear the tramp of the Black Hills party , I think . Horses have far better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ground that would not attract our attention . I want no better sentinel than my mustang , and your Black Hawk seems to take to the watch by instinct . I will go up on my look-out post and see if anything is in sight . " Slinging the strap of his field-glass over his shoulder , the Texan hurriedly climbed up the tree . Seated among the top-most limbs , he adjusted his glass and looked away to the northeast . " There they are ! " he cried . " Who ? What ? " exclaimed Pond , rather nervously . " The Black Hillers , struggling along mighty careless . Their route covers half a mile in length ; when in good marching order it should not cover a hundred yards , with scouts in the rear , front , and on both flanks , at twice the distance . That is the way we travel in Texas . " " Wild Bill has been a scout so long I should think he would know all about it , " said Pond . " A heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ! " said the Texan , in a tone of contempt . " Let them ride with a gang of Texan Rangers a few months and they 'd learn something . Your troops ca n't move , or stop to water , without sounding their bugles to tell the Indians where they are . In the morning , all day , and at night , it is toot , toot with their infernal horns , and the reds know just where to find ' em . One of our Texan Ranger bands will travel a hundred miles and you 'll not hear noise enough to wake a coyote from them all . These Black Hillers travel slow to-day . They 're sore-headed from their spree , I reckon . " " They deserve to be . Drunkenness always punishes the drunkard . I have no pity for them . " " Can you see any sign of them from where you stand ? " asked the Texan . Pond looked carefully off in the direction the other pointed , and replied : " No . They do not even raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation . They go too slow to make dust , and they 're moving over grass any way . It will be dark before they reach their camping-ground . But to make the next , which is full fifty miles away , they 'll have to start earlier . Ah ! what does that mean ? " " What startles you ? " " Nothing startles me , but a couple of men from that party have dashed out from the line at a gallop , and they ride this way . " " Heaven ! I hope Bill -- Wild Bill -- is not one of them ! " cried Pond , greatly excited . " Are you sure they are coming here ? " " Riding this way does not assume that they 're coming here ! " said the Texan , coolly . " They may have flanked off to look for some fresh meat . Yes , that is it , " he added . " They bear up to the north now ; they want to go ahead of the party so as to kill something fresh for supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , and I 'll wager he is one of the hunters , and most likely Sam Chichester is the other . We 're safe from observation , Mr. Pond , so do n't get nervous . We 'll not see Wild Bill to-day . " Pond smiled , but there was a tremor about him that showed he was easy to take alarm and hard to get over it . The Texan came down from the tree and busied himself in gathering some dry fuel -- small sticks which would make a quick hot blaze and little or no smoke . Then he cut off some long thin flakes of antelope flesh from the saddle hanging on the tree , and half cooked , half dried it . " Meat may be a little unhandy to get in the rear of that straggling band , " he said . " If we have a little on hand , it will do no hurt . " " You are thoughtful , " said Pond . " I would make a poor manager , I fear , on the plains . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not too old to learn , " said the Texan , laughing . " Excuse my asking the question , but have you long been acquainted with that strange and beautiful woman , Addie Neidic ? " " Not very long , myself . But I had a brother who knew her very well , and loved her almost to madness , She was his true friend , but she did not love him . " " Is he living now ? " " Living ? No ! If ever you meet Wild Bill -- but no , it is my secret . Ask me no more about him . " Every word just spoken flew from the Texan 's lips like sheets of fire ; his eyes flashed and his face flushed , while his form trembled from head to foot . " Forgive me ! I did not mean to wound your feelings ! " said Pond , moved by the excitement of the other . " No matter ; I know you did n't . No matter . It will all come right one of these days . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he saw the Texan 's eyes fill with tears , and he seemed to know that nothing which he could say could soften a grief so deeply felt . The Texan was the first to speak . " Addie Neidic is a strange , but a noble girl , " he said . " Her father was a rough sporting man , but her mother was a lady born and bred . The mother lived long enough to educate Addie in her own ways , but she died just as Addie was budding into beauty . Addie met her lover when he was a soldier at Fort Russell , near Cheyenne . After he was driven to desertion by cruelty and injustice , she met him from time to time , and when her father died , leaving her all his fortune , she moved up to Laramie . I think I know now the reason why -- she could , meet him more often . " " You said that he was an outlaw . " " Yes ; when he deserted he killed the two sentinels who were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode away on his horse . He was hunted for by whole companies as fast as they could be mounted , but he could not be taken . But after that , if a soldier or an officer rode alone a mile or more from the post , he seldom returned , but his body told that Persimmon Bill , the ' Soldier Killer , ' as he was called , still lived around . Wild Bill has done bloody work -- cruel work in his time , but Persimmon Bill has killed ten men to his one . " " It is strange that an intelligent woman like Addie Neidic should love such a man . " " No -- he is both a martyr and a hero in her eyes . A more stately form , a nobler face , never met favor in the eyes of woman . To his foes fierce and relentless , to her he is gentle and kind . She will never meet aught but tenderness at his hands . " " I wish I could have seen him . " " You may yet see him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antelopes which bound from ridge to ridge . Adopted by the Sioux nation , known to them as the ' White Elk , ' he has become a great chief , and their young braves follow in his lead with a confidence which makes them better than the solders sent to subdue them . " CHAPTER XIII . THE BLACK HILLERS EN ROUTE . The young Texan had judged rightly when he conjectured that it was Sam Chichester and Captain Jack that had ridden out from the straggling column of the Black Hillers , as he saw from his eyrie in the tree . They had two objects in doing so . The ostensible object was to reach the camping-ground first with some game for supper , but another was to converse , unheard by the others , on the probable dangers of the trip , and means to meet and overcome such dangers . " There is no doubt the Sioux are on the war-path , " said Chichester to Captain Jack , as they rode on side by side . " None in the world . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills route . The troops have been ordered to move up the Missouri and Yellowstone , and that will make them worse than ever . We 'll be lucky if we get through without a brush . That was a mean thing , the burning out of that Neidic girl last night , was n't it ? " " Yes , Crawford , and if Persimmon Bill ever comes across Wild Bill , his goose is cooked ! Mark that . There is not a surer shot , or a deadlier foe on earth then Persimmon Bill . He has defied the whole border for the past three years -- ridden right into a military post and shot men down , and got away without a scratch . They say he has been adopted by the Sioux , and if he has , with such backing he 'll do more mischief than ever . " " I do n't believe Bill would have injured the woman had he been sober . It was a mean thing to do any way , and I 'm sorry any of our party had a hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , you can see tree-tops ahead . That is the timber on Twenty-mile Creek . There we camp . We 'll spread a little here , and the one who sees a fat elk first will drop him . We 'll keep within sight and hearing of each other , and if one fires the other will close on him . " " All right , Sam . " And the brave young scout , all the better for being ever temperate and steady , gently diverged to the right , while Chichester bore off to the left . Game in the shape of prairie hens rose right and left as they rode on , and every little while a band of antelopes , taking the alarm , would be seen bounding over the sandy ridges , while an elk farther off startled by the antelope , would take fright and trot off in style . The two hunters were now nearing the timber , and they rode more slowly and with greater caution . Suddenly , as Chichester rose over a small ridge , he came upon a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly off to the right , where Captain Jack , seeing them coming , had sprung from his horse and crouched low on the ridge . Chichester saw his movement , and lowered the rifle which he had raised for a flying shot , for he knew by their course the elk would go so close to Crawford that he could take his pick among them and make a sure shot . The result justified his movement , for the noble animals , seeing only a riderless horse , scented no danger , and kept on until they were within easy pistol-shot of the experienced hunter . Crack went his rifle , and the largest , fattest elk of the band gave one mighty bound and fell , while the rest bounded away in another course , fully alarmed at the report of a gun so close and its effects so deadly to the leader of the band . " You 've got as nice a bit of meat here as ever was cut up , " cried Chichester to Captain Jack , as he came in at a gallop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The boys will have enough to choke on when we get to camp . " " I reckon they 'll not growl over this , " said Jack , laughing . " I never had an easier shot . They came down from your wind , and never saw me till I raised with a bead on this one 's heart . " The two hunters had their meat all cut up and in condition for packing to camp when the column came up . One hour later , just as the sun began to dip beyond the trees on the creek side , the party went into camp , and soon , over huge and carelessly built camp-fires , slices of elk steak and elk ribs were roasting and steaming in a most appetizing way . The party were hungry , and the hungriest among them were those who had drank the hardest the night before , for till now they had not been able to eat . But the day 's travel had worked some of the poison rum out of them , and their empty stomachs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fresh , juicy elk meat . It was a hard and unruly crowd to manage on the start . Chichester found it difficult to get men to act as sentinels , for they mostly declared that there was no danger of Indians and no need to set guards . Little did they dream that even then , within three hours ' ride , or even less , there were enough blood-thirsty Sioux to meet them in fair fight , and defeat them , too . Only by standing a watch himself and putting Crawford on for the most dangerous hour , that of approaching dawn , did Captain Chichester manage to have his first night 's camp properly guarded . Wild Bill , gloomy and morose , said he did n't " care a cuss " if all the Indians of the Sioux nation pitched upon them . He knew his time was close at hand , and what did it matter to him whether a red wore his scalp at his belt or some white man gloried in having wiped him out . But the night passed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Chichester made the men all fill their canteens with water , and the animals were all led into the stream to drink their fill , for there was a long , dry march to the next camping-ground . Chichester and Captain Jack both knew the route well , for they had both been over it in one of the first prospecting parties to the " Hills . " CHAPTER XIV . POND SEIZED WITH TERROR . Nothing of note occurred in the little camp at the Lone-tree Spring that first night . Just before sunset the young Texan and Willie Pond took a gallop of four or five miles to exercise their horses and use themselves to the saddle , and when they came back with freshened appetites , ate heartily , and afterward slept soundly . The next morning both woke with the sun , and after a hearty meal the pack-horse was loaded , the other animals saddled , and the route taken for the Hills . A ride of six or seven miles brought them into the trail of the larger party , and at noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camping-ground occupied by that party the night before . The embers of their fires were yet alive , and over them the Texan cooked dinner for himself and companion . Pointing to the bones and scraps of meat thrown around , the Texan laughed , and said : " They 've plenty now , but before they get through they 'll be more careful , for if the Indians are thick , game will be hard to get ; and I 'm thinking they 'll find Indians before they 're three days out . " " You said the Sioux would be friendly to you ? " " Yes ; I have a talisman . Did you not see me put this eagle feather , tipped with crimson , in my hat last night before I rode out ? " " Yes . Is that your talisman ? " " It is . It is from the coronet of a Sioux chief , and was given to me as a safeguard . " " I wish I had one . " " Keep with me and you will not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go far from you . Alone , I should feel utterly lost on these prairies . Where will we camp to-night ? " " Very close to the party that is ahead of us . They will go to a creek and a piece of timber that is fully fifty miles from here . About a mile from where I think they will camp there is a small ravine , in which we will find what grass and water we need . It will be near nightfall when we get there , if we do our best in travel . But if we ride hard , we 'll take the longer rest . I do not care to keep too close to them as a general thing , but to-night we ca n't help it . " Their nooning was short , and taking the precaution to water their horses well , and fill their canteens , they rode forward over the well-defined trail quite swiftly . Toward night they could see the trail freshened , but nothing was in sight except a distant mark when night fell , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . Just as the sun was setting smoke was seen to rise in that direction , and the Texan spoke contemptuously of the carelessness which would thus expose a camping-place to those who were miles distant . " If a captain of a ranger band would do such a thing in Texas , " he said , " his men would reduce him to the ranks and put one in his place who knew how to be cautious . " " It surely is imprudent . But they are a large party to cook for , and must have large fires , " said Pond . The young Texan laughed scornfully . " Let every man make his own fire , make such fires as you have seen me make , and the smoke could not be seen a rifle-shot away , " was the answer . " That party will never reach the Hills . Mark that ! If Indians are within twenty miles they 'll see a smoke like that . But what is it to us ? We 're safe . " " I am not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are safe ! " said Pond , testily . " That is as much as to say that I am selfish . Well , I acknowledge it . I go in for number one . If they ca n't take ordinary care of themselves , let them suffer . " Willie Pond made no answer , but rode on in silence . Night was now upon them , and all was still except the thud of the galloping hoofs upon the plain . Suddenly a gleam of fire was seen far ahead . The Texan noted it , and swerved off to the left . " There is the camp , " he said . " I can easily find our resting-place now . I was afraid we would not see their fires until we were right up to the timber . But they are careless with their fire as they are with their smoke . We shall have moonlight in an hour , and in less time we 'll be in camp . " He rode on now , more slowly , for the horses were tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no haste . The moon was just above the trees when the Texan led the way into a narrow ravine , with heavy timber on either side . Up this , full ten minutes they rode , and then an exclamation of pleased wonder broke from the lips of Willie Pond . For they came out into an open circular plain or area of several acres in extent , covered with rich grass and centered by a bright , mirror-like lake . " What a lovely spot ! " cried Pond . " Who on earth would dream of finding such a paradise inside of gates so dark and rude . " " One who had been here before , " said the Texan . " But speak low , for careless as they may be over there in camp , some one might be outside listening . " " Why , it is over a mile away , is it not ? " " Yes , along the line of the wood . But over this cliff , were it crossed , it is not a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rugged tree-crowned cliff on their right . " I will be careful , " said Pond . " My enthusiasm breaks out when I see beautiful things . I can hardly restrain myself . " " We will unsaddle and camp . Our horses are tired , and need food and drink , " was all that the Texan said . And he at once unloaded the pack-horse , and unsaddled his mustang . Pond , becoming more handy , now did the same for Black Hawk , who seemed to take quite a fancy to his new master , curving his back proudly under his caressing touch . " Shall I picket him , as we did at the last camp ? " asked Pond , when he had unsaddled his horse . " No , let him go with mine . They have been together long enough to mate , and they 'll feed peaceably in company . Mine will never stray or stampede , and the other will not go off alone . " The simple camp was soon fixed ; and as they had cooked meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , both agreed that there was no necessity to build any fire . " The smell of smoke might reach some sharp-nosed scout over there , " said the Texan , " for the wind blows that way . We 'll eat , and then turn in , for rest will come good to both of us . " The horses plunged off to the water and drank , and then went to cropping the luxuriant grass , while their masters ate their suppers with appetites strengthened by their long and wearying ride . After they had supped , Willie Pond would , as usual , have enjoyed his dainty cigarette , had not the Texan warned him that tobacco smoke would scent farther than any other , and might be more dangerous , in betraying their presence , than anything else . So Mr. Pond had to forego his smoke . He took a blanket , and moving up to a little mossy knoll just under the edge of the cliff , threw himself down to sleep . The Texan also took his blanket , but he lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary that he soon fell asleep . How long he slept he did not know , but a strange , oppressive dream woke him , and with the moonlight , shining full in the valley , while he lay shaded beneath a tree and the overhanging cliff , he saw a sight which froze his very heart with a mortal terror . The ravine by which he and his companion had entered was filled with mounted Indians , who were riding silently into the little valley . CHAPTER XV . CHEATED OF THEIR PREY . Literally dumb with terror , so weak that he could not rise , Pond saw this strange cavalcade moving up toward the little lake , and looked to the spot where the Texan had lain down to see if he had yet taken the alarm . To his wonder and redoubled alarm , he saw the Texan not alone , but with a white man , dressed in buckskin , by his side , and a woman also , apparently in friendly converse , calmly waiting the Indian advance . Recognizing at a glance the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no other than Persimmon Bill , and that his followers were the blood-thirsty Sioux , whom he headed . " Heaven help me ! There is some fearful treachery here . Wild Bill and his companions are lost if they are not warned in time . How can it be done ? " How strangely , as if by intuition , strategy , and cunning thought come to some when environed by unlooked-for danger . Without a moment 's hesitation , Pond so arranged his blanket that if glanced at it would appear he was yet sleeping under it , for he left his hat on the stone where his head had been , and his rifle leaning against the tree right over it . Then , bare-headed , with no weapons but his pistols and knife in his belt , he crept off up the hill-side with the silence and stealth of a scout who had been a life-time in the business . He wondered at himself as he began to scale the mountain-side , not daring to look back , how he could creep up amid those fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away unseen , when the Texan and those who were with him were not a pistol shot away . On , on he kept , ever seeking the shadowed spots , where no moonlight could reveal his form , until at last he was on the very crest of the hill . Looking down he plainly saw the camp-fires of the Black Hillers below . They were most likely buried in slumber , and , if they had sentinels out , his life would be endangered by a rapid approach . But of this he seemed not to think as he hurried almost recklessly down through thickets , over crags , and along rugged gulches . How he got down he hardly knew , but he was down , and rushing toward the nearest fire , when he heard a stern , short summons close in his front : " Halt ! Who comes there ? " A man , armed with rifle and pistols , stepped from the shadow of a tree , and Pond gasped out : " A friend . A friend come to save all your lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , led by the desperado Persimmon Bill . " " Who are you ? " was the stern inquiry . " Wild Bill will know me . Take me to him , quick ! " was the response . " To our captain first . Come along ! " said the sentinel . The next moment Willie Pond was in the presence of Sam Chichester and Captain Jack , telling his story . " It looks like truth , and if it is , the quicker we get out of here the better . If we can get fifteen or twenty miles the start we may keep it , " said Chichester . " He says Wild Bill knows him . Where is Bill ? " cried Jack . " Ah , there he comes . " Bill , awakened by hearing his name called , was rising , and now approached the party . Pond sprang forward , and addressed him hurriedly in whispered tones . Wild Bill for an instant seemed lost in astonishment , his first exclamation being , " Great Heaven ! you here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addressing Chichester : " Captain , this friend of mine will not lie . We are in danger , and he has risked his life to save us . I want a spare horse for him , and the sooner we get from here , the better for our hair . " With as little noise as possible , the whole party were aroused , and the danger explained . Quickly the animals were saddled , and in less than twenty minutes the camp-ground was all deserted , though more fuel had been purposely heaped on the fires to keep up the appearance of occupation , if scouts should be sent to examine the camp . " It lacks four hours yet to daylight ! " said Chichester to Captain Jack , " We 'll get just that much start , for they 'll make no attack until just as day begins to break . I know the ways of them red cusses only too well . " " You have n't much the advantage of me in that kind of knowledge , Sam . But if that fellow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well mounted , they 'll bother us yet before we get to the hills , no matter if we do get eighteen or twenty miles the start ! " " We 'll give ' em a long race and a tough tussle before they get our hair any way ! " said Chichester . " I wonder who that fellow is ? Bill seems to like him right well , for they ride as close as their horses can move together . Bill has supplied him with a hat -- he came in bare-headed , you know . " " Yes ; he must have had a terrible climb to get over to us . The only wonder is he got away undiscovered . " " He said he left his blanket in a shape to make them think he was sleeping under it . " " He must be an old hand to fool them so nicely . " " He does n't look like it , He does n't ride like a scout or a plainsman -- he sits his horse too gracefully . " " No matter ; one thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they stick as close together as twins . " " Yes , Captain Jack , I wish you 'd take the rear and make those packers keep up . There must be no lagging . If a horse or mule fails they must be left . I 'll keep the advance going . " Thus the Black Hillers swept on at a gallop , knowing that a merciless fate was theirs if overtaken by the Sioux . CHAPTER XVI . THE PURSUIT . The young Texan had not dreamed of being followed so soon by Persimmon Bill and his Indians , and he had lain down to sleep as honestly and confidently as Willie Pond , when he dropped down by the saddles and pack . He was aroused by a touch on his shoulder , when he awoke and was surprised to find Bill and Addie Neidic standing by his side . " Where are your Indians ? " was the first question the Texan asked , as Bill whispered , in a low tone : " I am here . I have followed the trail a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ravine waiting for my signal to come in and let their horses feed and rest before we attack . Where is your friend ? " continued Bill . " Sound asleep under that tree up there . He sleeps like a log , and will not wake till I shake him up . I never saw such a sleeper . Yesterday he spent most of the day snoring . " " It is well . There is no use of alarming him before we are ready for work . I will give the signal , and let my warriors file in . " The outlaw waved a blanket in the air , and the Indians silently filed into the valley . At another signal they turned their horses loose to graze , and then gathered in groups out on the plain to take food and rest themselves while their leader conversed with the Texan , whom having seen before , they knew as his friend . Meantime , the Texan motioning Addie Neidic and her lover to take seats on his blanket , conversed with the latter in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not make it until just as day dawns -- for two reasons , " said the outlaw . " First , then they will keep the most careless guard ; second , when light is coming , we can see how to kill , and how to save the two whose lives are to be spared . We will do the work in a hurry when it is done . I have given my warriors their orders ; most of them know Wild Bill and Captain Jack , for both have been on the reservations often when they have been in . For these reds can go where I can not , and get arms and ammunition where I would not dare apply for them . " " Shall I not make you and Addie some coffee ? " asked the Texan . " I can do it without danger , for I have a small alcohol lamp in my pack , which I had to keep for use when I could not get fuel . " It will be refreshing , indeed , if there is no risk in making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will soon have it made , " was the reply . Shaded from even Indian observation by the blanket he raised on some bushes , the young Texan speedily made a quart cupful of strong coffee , and shared it between the lady and her outlaw lover . It and some cooked meat he had gave them strength , and then all three lay down like the others to rest for an hour or two , the outlaw bidding one of his warriors keep watch , and to wake him when the morning star was seen over the trees in the east . And little dreaming that their intended victims were far away from their camp , the Indians and their leader took rest preparation to their deadly work . When his warrior sentinel awoke him , Persimmon Bill found that the morning star was well up , and it was full time to be moving toward the scene of action . " You will stay here in the valley , dear Addie , till we come back , " he said . " We will steal away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be helped , for he might , in his terror , fire his gun , or in some way give an alarm . Should he wake , hearing firing over there , keep him quiet with persuasion or your revolver until we return , and then if he is obstreperous , I will quiet him . " " Let me go with you , Bill , " she said . " I am not afraid . " " It must not be , dear Addie , There is no need of your being exposed there , and it is well to have him watched here . Our main certainty of complete success is in a surprise . The least alarm may prevent it . " " I will remain then , " she said . " And you need not fear for any alarm from him -- for I know I can keep him quiet should he wake . I have a keen persuader here , if I have to use it . " And she touched a poniard in her belt , which also contained two good revolvers . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " must be prepared to take care of herself . " The Indians now began silently to form their march , as they saw their white leader mount , and the young Texan also get his horse . The Black Hawk seemed uneasy that his master was not at hand , and the Texan was obliged to tie him by the side of the horse ridden by Addie Neidic before he would be quiet . " It is strange that Mr. Pond does not wake with all this noise , " said the Texan , as he rode off with Persimmon Bill . " But as I told you , he is the soundest sleeper I ever traveled with . " The Indians now filed away out of the valley as silently as they entered it , for , knowing the close vicinity of the other camp , they were aware how necessary it was to be cautious . And now Addie Neidic stood alone , while the morning star rose higher and higher , gazing at what she supposed was the sleeping man on the knoll . The moon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rifle against the tree , and the outlines of his form , as she believed . " I will move up and secure his rifle , " she thought , after the band had been gone some time . " He might wake ; and in his first alarm use it foolishly . " So she moved with a noiseless step within reach of the gun , and the next moment it was in her possession . Then she looked down , to see if he showed signs of waking . To her surprise , she saw no motions of a breathing form under the blanket . A closer look told her that if a form had been beneath the blanket , or a head under that hat , it was gone . And , feeling with her hand under the blanket , she , found it cold ; no warm living form had been there for hours . " He has been alarmed , seen us , and crept away -- perhaps is hiding in terror in the brush , " she muttered . She did not even then realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . She did not even understand several shrill yells , which reached her ear from over the hill . She had not been with the Sioux long enough to know their cries . These yells were the signal cries of scouts sent in , who had found a deserted camp . She only wondered , after hearing the yells , that she did not hear firing -- the sounds of battle raging . While she yet wondered , day dawned , finding her standing there by the empty blanket of Willie Pond , holding his rifle , and looking up the hill to see if he would not creep out , now that light had come and the Indians had gone . A shrill neigh from the black horse called her attention toward the animal , and she saw the Texan riding into the valley on a keen run . " Where is Bill ? " she asked , as she ran to meet the rider , with Pond 's blanket , hat , and rifle in her hand . " Gone at full speed with his warriors on the trail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and , have got at least two hours start . He sent me back to bring you and Pond along . " " Here is all of Mr. Pond that can be found , " said Addie , holding up what she had found . " I went to the nest , the bird had flown , and the nest was cold . " The Texan rode quickly to the spot , and in a moment saw the trail over the ridge made by Pond when he had escaped . " It was he who gave the alarm -- him whom I believed so sleepy ! " he muttered . " He must have seen Bill and the Indians when they first came , arranged his blanket and hat as you found it , and crept over the hill . When I cautioned him to keep quiet , I told him how near and in what direction they were . I see it all . Green as I took him to be , he has outwitted us all ! " " It is so . This is his horse -- a noble animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course ; and we must hurry on , for Bill is miles on the trail already . He will be even more surprised than we when he knows how the Black Hillers got warning . I 'll not give much for Mr. Pond 's hair , " said the Texan . In a few seconds the horse which Addie had ridden was saddled and ready , and , leaving his pack-horse behind , but leading the Black Hawk , the young Texan , with Addie Neidic by his side , dashed at full speed over the valley , and out of the ravine . Once out on the open plain , they could see far away to the west a cloud of dust . It was made by the Sioux under the White Elk , who were pushing the horses to their wildest speed on the trail of the fugitives . This trail the Texan and Addie Neidic followed at their utmost speed . The double trail made by the Black Hillers and the pursuing Indians would have been plain indeed to follow had not the column of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full speed , and better than the general run of Indian ponies , the Texan and his fair companion gained slowly but surely on the Indians , and within an hour had passed the rear of their column , and were pressing well to the front . Yet it was noon when they ranged alongside of Persimmon Bill himself , and reported the discovery Addie Neidic had made . " One more scalp ahead of us , " was all he said , when he heard the report . And he pressed on still faster . CHAPTER XVII . UNLOOKED-FOR AID . With their heavily-laden pack-horses , lengthy as their start was , the party under Chichester saw their pursuers plainly in their rear before the day was two-thirds passed , and Captain Jack , hurrying up the rear all he could , sent word to Chichester that the reds were gaining rapidly . Chichester sent word back to press the rear forward at its utmost speed . He could see timber ahead , and if they could only reach it , they might be able to make a stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over one hundred well-armed and well-mounted Indians were on his trail , fearful that many of his men would flinch in battle , he dared not , with the few that were true , make a stand on the open plain . Had all been like Wild Bill , California Joe , and Captain Jack , he would have halted , rested his horses , and given the reds battle rather than fly from even treble his number . But he knew well that a few cowards would weaken the rest , and he wanted to get some shelter before he met such odds . The timber was yet fully two hours ' ride distant , half of the pack-horses had given out and been left , and many of the mounted men complained that they could not keep their horses much longer in the column . Sam Chichester had been obliged to slacken the pace in front , and the enemy were gaining so fast that the glitter of their arms , could be seen even and the dust-cloud that rose above them . Suddenly another column of dust was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the timber , though south of the route the Black Hillers were taking . " Men ! " muttered Sam Chichester , " there 's no use in our running much farther . If that new cloud of dust is made by Indian 's , all that we can do is to sell our lives as dearly as we can . We will soon know one thing or the other . " " They 're not on the line we 're taking . They ca n't be coming for us , " said Captain Jack , who had ridden to the front . " They 're coming in our flank . " " And night is coming , too , " growled California Joe . " If we can keep on for two hours more , we 'll have darkness to shield us , for no red will fight in the dark without he attacks , and has camp-fires to light up with . " " We 'll keep them , on while an animal will move , and when we must , turn and fight for life or vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Forward , men -- forward once more ! " Again Captain Jack took the post of honor , for such indeed was the rear guard in this case . Suddenly , on looking back , he saw that the Indians , instead of gaining , had come to a halt . " They 've given it up ! they 've given it up ! " he cried , sending a messenger forward to Captain Chichester to slacken the speed of the column . It was now almost sundown , and the men in the column , choked and thirsty , weary beyond expression , could hardly believe the news was true . They were soon satisfied , though , that it was ; but it was not for an hour yet , when twilight was beginning to gather , that they learned the real cause of their present safety . The Indians would have been upon them before night set in , had they not first discovered the nature of the dust cloud to the south-west , or rather who it was raised by . The field-glass of the Texan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cavalry guidons amid the dust , and showed that mounted troops were near enough to come to the aid of the Black Hill men before they could be crushed and their scalps taken . So , much against his will , Persimmon Bill was obliged to slacken his pace , and soon to turn his course , so , as by a night march , to put his warriors beyond the reach of those who might turn on them . When night fell , Chichester , joined by two companies of cavalry , bound for the Hills , under orders to join forces already on the way by another route , moved slowly to a camping-ground in the timber , for which he had been heading hours back . The horses of the troops were weak from scant forage , and the commanding officer did not feel it his duty to wear them out chasing Indians , though he held himself ready to protect the mining party as long as they remained with him . And they were just too willing to go on with such an escort , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their trail ; and had Persimmon Bill only halted , instead of falling back , he would have found that there was no danger of pursuit . Chichester and Crawford , when they compared notes , and found not a man of their party lost , though half its property was gone , felt satisfied that it was no worse , for at one time it seemed to both that nothing was left to them but to sell their lives as dearly as they could . In a well-guarded camp all were settled before the moon rose , and never was rest more needed by animals and men . CHAPTER XVIII . ON THE DEATH-TRAIL . Bivouacked on the treeless plain , so far from the old trail and from the timber ahead that they could see no sign of the Black Hillers or the troops , the next morning 's sun rose on the band of Sioux led by Persimmon Bill . Used to all kinds of exigencies , the red men did not mind either a lack of food or of water for so short a time . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had deemed an easy prey had escaped them . As soon as it was light , Persimmon Bill had the captured pack-horses examined , and it was found that several of them were laden with provisions . Others had ammunition and stores , and on some of them were found kegs of liquor . These the wary leader at once destroyed , telling his followers that there was no foe so deadly to the red man as this fire-water and not one drop should pass his lips or theirs . The provisions were at once distributed among them , as also the stores , but the liquor was given to the thirsty sands , where at least it could do no harm . Then a council was held by the leader with the chiefs and head warriors of the band , and it was decided that it would be foolish to pursue the Black Hill people farther , now that troops were with them , unless a large band of Sioux could be found . For it is not Indian policy to risk battle against odds , or where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and good hunting-grounds was their first necessity ; after that they could consider where next to go . Sitting Bull was rallying all the tribes for war , and the " White Elk " had promised to join him . Gloomily the young Texan heard all this talk , and at its close , when a decision had been arrived at , he said : " Here we must part . I follow the trail of Wild Bill , if I follow it alone . I had hoped to see him die a slow and cruel death , where I could have heard him plead , and plead in vain for mercy . But that hope is gone , if he reaches the Hills in safety . But he can not live -- he shall not ! I have sworn to kill him , and I will ! The spirit of him who fell at Abilene cries up from a bloody grave for vengeance , and the cry shall be answered . You have been kind to me Addie Neidic , and so has he to whom your heart is given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie apart -- I follow yonder trail , while you go I know not where . We may not meet again -- if we do , I shall tell you Wild Bill is dead ! " " Stay with us . I will yet help you to your vengeance , " said Persimmon Bill . " No ; it will be too long delayed . I am hot on the death-trail now , and I will not leave it . Fear not for me . I shall hover near them till they reach the Hills , and then I will not wait long to fulfill my work . When the deed is done , if I still think life is precious , and his friends press me too hard , I may look for safety , as you have done , with the Sioux . " " Come and you shall find in me a sister , and in him a brother , " cried Addie Neidic . " A brother ? I had one once , " came in a low , sobbing cry from the young Texan 's lips ; then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks , he drove the spurs into his horse , and sped away swiftly in the direction of the old trail . The Black Hawk horse , saddled and bridled , but riderless , galloped on by the side of the Texan 's fleet mustang , with no wish to part from his company . " He had death in his eye ! He will kill Wild Bill , and we shall never see him again , " said Persimmon Bill . " The miners are rough , and condemn before they try , and hang as soon as condemnation is spoken . I pity the boy -- for he is but a boy . " Addie Neidic smiled . " We shall see your boy again , " she said , " Something seems to whisper to me that his fate is in some way linked with ours . I , too , feel sure that he will kill Wild Bill , and then escape to join us . And you , my hero , will rise till all these Indian nations call you king . How these who follow you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And think , on these vast plains , and in the endless range of hills , valleys , and mountains , there must be countless thousands , who want but a daring , skillful leader to make them the best light troops in the world . " " You are ambitions for me , dearest , " said Bill , with a strange , sad smile . " I hope to prove worthy of your aspirations . But we must move . I head now for the Big Horn Valley , to meet Sitting Bull . " CHAPTER XIX . " SAVE , OH , SAVE MY HUSBAND ! " " Safe and in port at last , as old Cale Durg used to say , when a scout was over and he was back in garrison . " This was the joyous exclamation of Captain Jack Crawford , as he turned to Sam Chichester when their party rode into the settlement at the Deadwood Mines in the Black Hills . Escorted nearly all the way by the cavalry they had so providentially met , they had been troubled no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some horses , and part of their " fit-out " and stores , had suffered nothing . Not a man had been hurt , and best of all , they came in sober , for the benzine had all gone with the lost packs , for it was heaviest on the mules , as it would have been on the men , had it not been host . " I 'm glad the trip is over . My temper never has been more tried , " said Chichester . " The most of the men have had their own way , though when we started they promised on honor to obey me as captain . But honor is a scarce article with the majority of them . Now they 're here , they 'll go it with a looseness . " " You bet , " was Crawford 's sententious remark . " Wild Bill will be in his element . Look at the signs . Rum , faro , monte , all have a swing here , you can swear . " " Men , into line one minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party . For a wonder , with temptation on every side , the weary riders obeyed , and drew up in a straggling line to hear their leader 's parting speech . " Men , I promised to bring you here safely if I could , but to get all of you here that I could , any way . I 've kept my promise we 're here . " " Ay ! Three cheers for Sam Chichester ! " shouted Wild Bill . The cheers were given , and Chichester said : " Thank you , boys . Now do me one favor . You are here in a busy place , and I see by the sign that benzine is about as plenty as water . Touch it light , and do behave , yourselves , that my name will not be disgraced by any of Sam Chichester 's crowd . Every man is his own master now , and must look out for himself . I wish you all good luck , and shall work hard for it myself . " The speech was over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seeking quarters or pitching into the benzine shops . Wild Bill would have been the first to go there , had not his companion , Willie Pond , said , in a low tone : " Bill , please get quarters for you and me before you do anything else . You know what you have promised . Remember , if it had not been for me , neither you nor one of this party would ever have got here . " " You 're right . But I 'm so cussed dry ! " muttered Bill . " You 're right , I 'll find housing for us two before a drop passes my lips . " And Bill rode on to the upper part of the town , as it might be called , where some men were putting up a new shanty , in fact , just putting the finishing touch on it by hanging a door . " Will you sell that shebang ? " asked Bill , of the man who seemed to be the head workman . " Yes , if we get enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " These two horses , and a century , " said Bill , pointing to the animals ridden by himself and companion , and holding up a hundred-dollar bill which Pond had furnished him . " O. K. The house is yours ! " said the man . " Boys , put for timber , and we 'll have another up by sunset . " Bill and his companion dismounted , removed their blankets , arms , and saddle-bags into the house , gave up the horses and were at home . It did not take long to settle there . * * * * * * * * Night had fallen on the town of Deadwood , but not the calm which generally comes with night where the laborer is but too glad to greet the hour of rest . Lights flashing through chinks in rude cabins , lights shimmering through canvas walls , songs , shouts , laughter , curses , and drunken yells made the place seem like a pandemonium on earth . Almost every other structure , either tent , cabin , or more pretentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or both combined . And all these seemed full . The gulches , sinks , and claims that had been the scene of busy labor all the day were now deserted , and the gold just wrenched from the bowels of the earth was scattered on the gambling table , or poured into the drawer of the busy rumseller . At this same hour , a man rode into the edge of the town on a noble black horse , leading a tired mustang . Both of these animals he staked out in a patch of grass , leaving the saddles on , and the bridles hanging to the saddle-bow of each . Then he placed his rifle against a tree near by , took the old cartridges out of a six-shooter and put in fresh ones . This done with the greatest deliberation , he pulled his slouch hat well over his face , entered the nearest saloon , threw down a silver dollar , and called for brandy . A bottle and glass were set before him . He filled the glass to the brim , drank it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuss , here ! " cried the bar-keeper . " Here 's a half comin ' to you ; we only charge half-price when it goes by wholesale ! " The joke fell useless , for the red-haired man had not remained to hear it . In the largest hall in the place , a heavy gambling game was going on . There was roulette , faro , and monte , all at different points . Before the faro-table there was the greatest gathering . Wild Bill , furnished with money by the person known to us so far as Willie Pond , was " bucking against the bank " with , his usual wonderful luck , and the crowd centered around him as a character more noted and better known than any other who had yet come to Deadwood . " I 'll bet my whole pile on the jack ! " shouted Wild Bill , who had taken enough strong drink to fit him for anything . " Do be careful , Bill -- do be careful ! " said a low , kind voice just behind him . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mind your business . I 'll break this bank to-night , or die in the trial ! " cried Bill , defiantly . " You 'll die before you break it ! " shrieked out a shrill , sharp voice , and the red-haired Texan sprang forward with an uplifted bowie-knife , and lunged with deadly aim at Bill 's heart , even as the person we have so long known as Willie Pond shrieked out : " Save , oh , save my husband ! " But another hand clutched the hilt of the descending knife and the hand of a short , thickset , beetle-browed desperado , was shouted , as he drew a pistol with his other hand : " Wild Bill is my game . No one living shall cheat me of my revenge ! Look at this scar , Bill -- you marked me for life and now I mark you for death ! " And even as he spoke , the man fired , and a death-shot pierced Wild Bill 's heart . The latter , who had risen to his feet , staggered toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutch of the real assassin , and with a wild laugh , tore the false hair from the Texan 's head . As a roll of woman 's hair came down in a flood of beauty over her shoulders , Bill gasped out : " Jack McCall , I 'm thankful to you , even though you 've killed me . Wild Bill does not die by the hand of a woman ! " A shudder , and all was over , so far as Wild Bill 's life went . His real and true wife wept in silence over his body , while sullen , and for a time silent , the supposed Texan stood and gazed at the dead body . Then she spoke , addressing McCall : " Villain , you have robbed me of my revenge ! for by my hand should that man have fallen . No wrong he could have done you can be more bitter than that which put me on his death-trail , and made me swear to take his life . " Two years ago a young man left a ranch close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle , which had been bought from him , to be paid for when delivered in Abilene , Kansas . He was noble , brave , handsome . He was good and true in all things . He was the only hope of a widowed mother , the very idol of a loving sister , whose life seemed linked with his . He promised when he left those he loved and who so loved him that he would hasten back with the proceeds of the sale , and then , with his mother and sister , he would return to the birthplace of the three , to the old Northern homestead , where his father 's remains were buried , buy the old estate , and settle down to a quiet and a happy life . Long , anxiously , and prayerfully did that mother and sister wait for his return . Did he come ? No ; but the soul-blighting news came , which , like a thunderbolt , struck that mother -- my mother -- dead ! Wild and despairing , I heard it -- heard this . " The son , the brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life ; who never uttered an oath , or raised a hand in unkindness to man or woman , had been murdered -- killed without provocation -- no chance to defend his life , no warning to prepare for another world -- shot down in mere wantonness . There lies the body of him who did it . Do you wonder that , over my dead mother 's body , girl though I was , I swore to follow to the death him who killed my brother ? It is not my fault that I have not kept my oath . I would have done it had I known that you , his friends , would have torn me limb from limb before his body was cold . " " And served him right ! " said an old miner , whose eyes were dimmed with moisture while the Texan girl told her story . " Where is McCall ? His act was murder , " cried Sam Chichester . " He has sloped , but I 'll take his trail , and if there is law in Montana he shall hang , " said California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discovered that the murderer had slipped away in the moment of excitement . How well California Joe kept his promise , history has already recorded . Followed over many a weary mile of hill and prairie , McCall was finally arrested , tried and convicted , as well by his own boast as the evidence of others , and he was hanged . But one glance at our heroine , for such the red-haired Texan is . With a look of haughty defiance , she asked : " Have I done aught that requires my detention here ? " " No , " said Captain Jack ; " thank Heaven you have not . We 'd make a poor fist at trying a woman by Lynch law , if you had done what you meant to . " " Then I go , and few will be the white faces I ever see again ! " she cried . The next moment she passed out , and as the crowd followed to see whither she went , she was seen to spring on a coal-black horse which stood unhitched before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed away toward the north-west , while a saddled but unridden mustang followed close behind her . The course she took led toward the regions where Sitting Bull , in force , awaited the attack of the soldiers then on his trail . THE END .
