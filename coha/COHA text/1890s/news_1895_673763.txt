txt Since the recent election several prominent Republican journals in the Central West have repeatedly and very forcibly denounced and the tariff . We have read with much interest their remarks on this subject , for we remember well their course with respect to this question during the last four years . Speaking within bounds ; we may say that it has been tortuous . In 1890 , before the passage of the bill , these journals freely expressed their disapproval of the characteristic features of that measure , frequently publishing sharp warnings which the tariff-makers did not heed . And when the passage- of the bill was followed in the Fall of that year - by the memorable ' defeat of their party at the polls , these journals pointed with melancholy satisfaction to what they had said .

We have preserved as curiosities some of these enthusias'fie utterances , having placed them by the side of those earlier ones which were of a decidedly different character . These same journals now have gone back to their original views concerning and the act . Their party having regained the House , and the prospect that it will have unrestricted power to legislate in 1897 being , in their opinion , favorable , they are giving out apparently earnest warnings and at the same time are denouncing in language the sharpness of which has never been excelled by the Democratic press . But what would they say if their party should carry the elections in 1896 and then re-enact the tariff or make a tariff statute closely resembling it in all essential parts ? If we judge by their course heretofore , they would support this policy warmly and denounce all who should oppose it . We hope , however , that they will remain steadfast in the attitude which is exhibited by the opinions they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
