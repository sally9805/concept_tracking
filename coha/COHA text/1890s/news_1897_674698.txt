txt The School Board of this place is in a peculiar position once more , owing to the act of the voters of the district , live years ago , in separating the white and colored children and establishing a special schoolhouse for the colored children . The Rev. A. W , Harper , pastor of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church , refused last year to allow his children to attend the school for the colored children , and demanded they be admitted to the white school . The School Board refused to accede to his demand , claiming that under the ordinance they must keep the colored children separated , and as th0 course of study in the two schools was exactly alike , and the colored children had as good teachers as the white children , there was no discrimination shown . Mr. Harper went away before the matter was settled , and the board thought It was rid of the trouble , All the other negroes in the district were sat'stied with the arrangement , and many colored families living outside of the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rev. A. W. Pierce succeeded Mr. Harper and has brought about a renewal of the trouble . This is not , however , on the same lines as raised by his predecessor . Mr Pierce has a daughter fifteen years old who has mastered all that is taught in the colored school , and as there is no other coiored child in the district able to accompany her , her father made application to the white school for the admission of his daughter . Principal Replogle examined the minister 's daughter and found she had passed through all the grades which the colored school accommodates . and therefore admitted and assizned her to a place in one of the regular classes . The Board took a different view of the matter , and claimed it could not permit the girl to attend the school . The officials offered to have one of the teachers instruct the girl after hours , but this was not satisfactory to the father , who now threatens to carry the matter to the State Superintendent .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
