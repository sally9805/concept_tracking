txt In a brief review of the condition of the paper trade , Bradstreet 's said last Satur-day : " The formation of the Envelope Trust has been delayed , owing to the refusal of a large concern in Worcester to undertake the agreements demanded by the other mills . It is expected that these manufacturers will soon oomply with the terms and thus complete the organization . " This projected Trust appears to be a renewal of the old one , concerning which some interesting testimony was given by members of it before the investigating committee of the Assembly in this State a little more than two years ago . The old one , which was organized by means of a chartered corporation called the Standard Envelope Company and with the aid of certain agreements with manufacturers of envelope machinery , suffered a loss of power some months ago through the defection of one or two manufacturers . Immediately after the formation of the original Trust the prices of envelopes were considerably increased . The protective duty of 25 per cent . enabled the manufacturers to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher , and the manufacturers appear to have decided that they will take advantage of it by a combination . " Men who knew that new duties were designed to benefit the whole people , " said the New-York Tribune mournfully a few days after the recent election , " nevertheless set themselves at once in some instances to contrive combinations and Trusts by which to deprive the millions of all participation in those benefits . They reckon that the voters ought to be contented with such benefits only as a combination of dealers or producers might choose to leave them . " The envelope manufacturers seem to belong to the class thus berated by our neighbor . The old duty was 25 per cent . and the new one is 25 cents per thousand envelopes . That the old duty was high enough to be substantially prohibitory is shown by the official reports to the effect that the value of the envelopes imported was only $6,500 in 1887 , $2,994 in 1888 , and $9,646 in 1869 . In spite of these figures , and in the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in this way raisedtheir prices , the duty was fixed at 25 cents per thousand in the Allison bill of 1888 , and has now been made a part of the law in the act . It will be noticed that the duty was changed from an ad valorem to a specific , one . For this reason the increase is not clearly seen by the public . In the volume of statistics and explanations prepared for the use of the Senate by Senators ALDRICH , ALLISON , and HISCOCK in obedience to the resolution of Mr. PLUMB , the increase was admitted in the following words on page 99 : " It is well understood that the rate proposed 25 cents per thousand is a large increase over existing rates on the cheaper qualities of envelopes . " But the committee did not explain why it had been deemed expedient to increase so largely a duty that was already high enough to keep out foreign envelopes even after a combination had suppressed competition in the home market and raised the price of the domestic goods . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will enjoy their power to make the prices of the " cheaper qualities " higher than these could safely be made under the old tariff . But who will venture to say that the Republioan tariffmakers , foes of all combinations , had this in mind ?
