txt Ou* of the most curious consequences arising from the ten fingers of man is the decimal system of notation . From this , among many other things , has arisen the division of the historic ages into centuries . At first these periods of one hundred years had no other estimation among the masses than that which came from their convenience . The passage from one of these epochs to another was practically unnoticed , but in our times the transition from the eighteenth to the nineteenth of these spans is awaited with a remarkable emotional as well as intellectual interest . Even among the masses of our folk we find all intelligent persons looking back over the triumphs of their time with satisfaction , and forward with much expectation to the gains which they and their successors may hope to win in the next great division of the years . This sympathetic absorption in the affairs of their kind is indeed the greatest and the most widespread of all the triumphs which civilized man has won from his experience in the century which is passing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratulation and hope which men may be minded to seek in the onward march of the world during the last three generations . In this period the winnings in the moral and physical fields of social development may be well set against the thousand years which came before . The abolition of slavery , the establishment , in a great variety of forms , of personal liberty , the extension of the comity of nations , as well as the vast and swiftly extending march of invention find discovery in the material realm , justify the pride of those who have had a share in the great accomplishment , and warrant the fervid anticipation of the future which animates the millions on both sides of the Atlantic . // It is evident that the civilized world , through the review and forecast which the end of this nineteenth century has enforced , is rapidly entering upon a state of sympathetic exaltation , the like of which has not been known since the end of the first thousand years , when all Europe awaited the millennium as the time when the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was despair ; in this it is an inspiring desire to achieve . Such psychological moments are the rarest things of the world ; they afford to the true philanthropist the precious occasions to contrive for the effective advance of man . Properly used , this critical period may afford the occasion for remedying the greatest of all human ills , which has been left untouched by all the benefits which our age has won . This evil is war . The historian of the nineteenth century will need to look closely if he is to understand the conditions which led to such momentous gains as it has achieved , while they left the greatest and most senseless of human ills quite without relief . It is likely that the explanation of this surprising state is to be found in the slow extinction of the ancient and therefore abiding prejudices which separate the races , the nations , the tongues , and the creeds ; in the prepossessions and interests arising from the maintenance of military castes ; and in the exceeding difficulty which has been encountered in forcing the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encompass governments . The spiritual awakening of the moment , that promises to b* the greater in the immediately forthcoming years , affords a singularly favorable opportunity to those who would work for peace . Properly used , it may be made the occasion for the creation of a motive , and a system resting thereon , which , within the days of those who take part in the good work , may practically do away with the worst of human misfortunes . Properly to use this opportunity to make for peace , two things are evidently desirable ; in the first place , those who are devoting themselves to the cause should endeavor to extend their propaganda not through vaporous congresses , which by their successive and absurd failures give an intangible air to the whole eneeavor , but by means of a determined system of education , which shall bring before the youth a true sense of the moral and economic abominations of war . It should be recognized that the military motive had been fixed in the inheritances of our race by // ages of habit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the olden days led to the survival of the most militant tribes to be the foundations of our present states . It should be perceived that our literature is as a gospel of combat to young and ardent spirits . There is scarcely a bit of good writing which is likely to meet the eyes of ordinary readers which paints war as it really is . The Old Testament is one of the worst offenders in this praise of battle . Although , in common with most sensible people , the reader is probably to be ranked with those who believe that there are sundry things much worse than the slaying of men , and that , under certain conditions , campaigns may well be waged with all the consequent loss of life and destruction of the gains that life wins , it may be assumed that he regards the present status as an abominable condition of things , where national vanity , the inst of power , or ancient hatred , keeps the civilized world in a state of continued crises , in which an explosion is always imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be not to reduce men to be passive lovers of mere existence , mere non-resistants ; to accomplish this end is fortunately impossible , and ostensibly to seek it is to bring the movement for peace into discredit with those who estimate the possessions of their civilization at their real value . The rational and hopeful object should be to show war in its true light as a relic of savagery , which has been enabled to survive in our civilizations mainly because of the rhetorical and artistic trappings which hide its true shameful aspect from the understanding . To make head against the influences which serve to propagate the love of war it seems necessary to begin the task in our school system . Already there is some foundation for teaching of this sort in the instruction which is now being essayed concerning the rights and duties of the citizen . It will be a simple and appropriate addition to this good work to set forth the actual see the nobility and dignity of civilization and the destruction that war makes in it . It would be made plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as preposterous , and in a way disgraceful , to go ever armed with deadly weapons against the remote possibility of some ruffianly assault ; it is the ruffian alone who clings to this ancient brutal // way ; he is not to be reckoned with in any decent society . A slight extension of the same conception will make it clear to the youth that any collection of people which maintains a vast standing army simply that it may thus better be able to assail its neighbors , is in the position of a man who goes about his peaceful occupations in readiness for slaying his fellows . There can be no doubt that the time has come for the deliberate and systematic teaching of those truths which will serve to build in the minds of the people right notions as to the relation of violence to societies . We have trusted too much to the secondary effects of advancing culture to keep down the old evil of militarism . We have relied on the absence of a great standing army and on the uses of peace to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the shadow of the greatest conflict of modern days still upon us , we find the leading representatives of a great party , even men who have been exposed to all the cultivating influences which our country can afford , who know , or who have had every opportunity to comprehend , the misery which war entails , yet who are ever seeking to embroil their own nation with others . It needs but a glance at the records of the last Congress to show that our law-givers lack all sense of what they are seeking , when they clamor for war as a means of vengeance or of national self-assertion . We need to breed up men who have a more civilized view of human relations . While the review of this century and the forecast of the next may well lead us to determined effort toward the education of our people away from the old irrational inhuman motives which led them to look upon warfare as a natural and ready instrument for the settlement of disputes , there is another and more immediate means by which we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To set forth this means is the main object of this writing . As before remarked , this last hundred years has mended or at least bettered the lot of man in almost every regard except in the frequency and destructiveness of its wars . There may have been centuries in which this Moloch has demanded a larger share of the people in sacrifice , but there have probably been none in which the aggregate tax on life and property has been so great , or in which there has been less in the way of profit to show for the destruction . It is assuredly most fit that we should do what we can to establish some international body which // shall at least set about the task of devising the means whereby we may hope to begin the new account of years with the prospect of bettering the conditions . This nndertaking can be most fitly proposed by our own conntry , for the reason that while we have an nnhappy history for a peace loving people there can be no doubt that , with the exception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their object . We have shown an eminent capacity for military work by waging the greatest civil war the world has ever known , and we have in the Alabama negotiations settled a dispnte which in the ordinary conduct of international affairs would have resulted in an armed conflict . The policy of our government , as determined by an overwhelming majority of our people , is undoubtedly that of peace . We have no basis for quarrels with our neighbors ; it is hardly to be conceived that any will arise which will not be settled in an amicable manner . These facts make it fit that onr federal authorities should take the lead in the good work by extending an invitation to the leading states of the civilized world to join in an official international congress , having for its purpose the establishment of some convention to diminish the danger of warlike contests . At first sight it may seem futile for this or any other government to undertake to promote an official gathering of delegates from the leading European powers , with the hope of restricting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been held to be absolutely witnin the bounds of their individual ju*gments . In the present conditions of human nature , it is not to be expected that any nation will give to any commission a right to restrict the liberty to expend its blood and treasure in any canse which may seem to , its people to justify the sacrifice . Accepting this limitation , as we needs must do , let us see whether there remains enough in the way of possible good to justify the endeavor which has just been recommended . Let us suppose that our government , by an act of its Congress , should invite the other first-class powers , say those to which it sends ambassadors , to appoint each three delegates to meet those from this country in Washington , on the 1st of January , 1897 , the object being to see what may be done to diminish the danger of armed contests . It may fairly be reckoned that the object of the movement will commend itself to the minds of all intelligent // people and that the greater number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidden to the assembly , will accept the invitation . It being assumed , as above suggested , that it is out of the question directly to limit the initiation in the matter of declaration of war , what are the recommendations which this commission of enquiry could possibly make that would justify the meeting ? It seems not unreasonable to suggest that the conference might advise the institution of a permanent international peace commission , composed of delegates from the several national authorities , which should hold annual sessions and which could be called together whenever it became evident that there was danger of a warlike contest between any of the contracting parties , this permanent commission to have no actual powers except those of mediation preceding or during a conflict , and of suggestions concerning limitations or the reduction of standing armies and navies . The arrangement for the use of the influence of the commission might well be as follows : The several states might agree that , in a case of impending warlike outbreak between any two members of the association , the commission might send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be heard before the declaration of war . This commission might furthermore agree to consider the recommendations for progressive disarmament at some definite and proportional rate , or for the replacement of standing armies by an organized militia , say of the Swiss type . The considerations may extend to the point of submitting the propositions to the legislature or other bodies which have charge of the budgets of the several states , there being no guarantee given that the government concerned shall approve of the propositions as submitted by the commission . It might be well to charge the commission with the task of bettering the statement of the body of customs which is termed international law ; it is possible that in course of time something like effective codification of these usages might be brought about . At first sight it may seem that a body of men however much weight they might have from their individual value would be without influence , because without the slightest power to make their decisions felt . But the essence of the strength which such a commission would possess would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of arbitration . This public opinion is now so strong that // even the most despotic of the civilized governments feels its influence in the conduct of affairs . The action of this opinion is felt not only from within ; every state which may be termed civilized earnestly desires the approval of the neighbors with which it is linked in the relation of commerce . We may indeed take the amount of this sympathetic spirit as the best possible index as to the measure of civilization to which a people has attained . There would be strength enough in the commission to bring this public opinion to a distinct and authoritative form : it may be presumed that in many if not most instances it would be ineffective in preventing war , but it would certainly add much to the influences which make against the occurrence of these disasters . We may profitably imagine the steps which the international board of arbitration would take in case there was evident danger of trouble between two of the states in the league . When the situation became critical the commission would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases perhaps due to the suggestions of the parties in dispute , its place of meeting would be on the nearest neutral ground , say in general in Switzerland . As it may be supposed that the persons representing the several states would be men of great weight , in general distinguished diplomats , the meeting would of itself have a decided effect in calling attention to the desirability of arbitration . From the commission there would be sent to the authorities of the endangered states delegates who , by the agreement , would have to be heard . The presence of an accredited messenger of peace in a capital where the war spirit was high might not be welcome ; but it would be in some large measure effective . By the contract this messenger would have a right to be heard , and his suggestions made in conferenc* with the delegate or delegates acting at the other court would assuredly make for delay in the declaration of war . It is , of course , conceivable , in fact eminently probable , that in some cases the authorities would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , or his advice would be avoided , yet we may be sure in any probable conditions a government , however desirous of beginning a war , would hesitate to incur the odium which would arise from taking such a course ; they would probably try to manage the situation ; this would make for delay and and delay would make for peace . Assuming the worst possible // result , that in which the efforts of the delegates were quite ineffective , we have a burden laid upon one or both of the combatants which would be hard to bear in face of the criticism of the better people of other countries . They would be in the position of men who had fired on a flag of trnce . Supposing that nothing could be done to prevent the outbreak of war , the commission could still look forward with some hope to lessening the duration of the strife . There have been many occasions in which a neutral power has been able with advantage to mediate between combatants and to lessen the dangers of long continued conflict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a congress representing the civilized world , would have singular weight , and , we may presume , a degree of efficiency which would not be attainable when essayed by any one state . As we may presume that the delegates in the commission would be in communication with the several governments , each tender of peace would represent the motives of them all . Thus before and after the declaration of hostilities , the proposed board would bring to bear on the situation the moral force of the world , a force which is now very strong for peace , and which will be greatly increased in strength whenever an efficient system for its application is established . Although there is much to hope from the action of a peace commission in the crisis of war , it is likely that its usefulness in treating with the conditions which favor conflict may be even more important . The principal instigation to armed conflict is the continued and competitive preparation for it ; it is perfectly natural that a state possessing a vast and costly war engine , ever ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time to ascertain the strength of its cherished power . It would be beyond the limits of human nature if a body of officers containing tens of thousands of the ablest and most ardent men of this generation should not long for the opportunity to do the deeds for which their lives are a preparation . There can be no question that standing armies of the proportion which these hosts have taken on in modern continental Europe are in a high degree provocative of wars ; every plan which contemplates a reduction of this danger by a systematic and mutual decrease of the permanent forces of the several states would be sure to be received with interest . So far there has been no opportunity for the prosecution of a plan for // such a reduction of standing armies ; none of the governments which are concerned would be inclined to take the initiative in the process even by calling a conference to consider the question , for by so doing it would confess the seriousness of the burden which weighs so heavily on them all . We might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the reduction of standing armies and navies which would have a chance to be adopted . This project might include a scaling down of the annual levy to a determined per cent. , so that at the end of a certain number of years , the men continually under arms in any one state should not exceed say one soldier to each one thousand of the population . This would leave the several governments free to organize a high grade , easily mobilized , militia , on the basis of the Swiss system , a body of troops nearly as efficient for purposes of defence as a standing army of like size , but which can be kept in a tolerably good state by a sacrifice of not more than one month of each year in camp , a tax on their time which would not deprive the men of their places in industrial pursuits . Those who have seen bodies of the Swiss citizen soldiers will , if they have a judgment in such matters , agree with the assertion that they are likely to prove as useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborately trained men from any part of Europe . The advantage of a militia in the interests of peace is found in the fact that the men never become imbued with the war spirit ; they look upon the military side of their life as an incident ; they are men of peaceful callings , and have the instincts which belong to such people , but which are foreign to the professional soldier . They are willing to bear arms for the one cause which really warrants war  --  the protection of their country from invasion . The burden of standing armies , directly upon the budget and indirectly upon productiveness of the people , is now so patent to all the statesmen of Europe that there is a reasonable chance for6the favorable reception of a proposition to effect a proportional reduction of their permanent forces . The need is to have some tolerably independent source whence these suggestions can come , a source with the moral authority , at , least , to enforce any understanding which might be entered into . It is possible that a commission such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , but a plan if well matured would concentrate the atten // tion of people upon one of the means by which the risks of war could be diminished . If the board were to be given a life of ten years and should steadily endeavor to bring about the change , there would be a fair chance of its success in the endeavor . If the change could be made from the system of standing armies to that of a true militia of the Swiss type , a long step towards enduring peace would be made . In a military system of this nature the soldier and the citizen would be identical when put in the field ; the men would take with them that quality of the . household which makes the Swiss soldier an admirable home guard , but not to be considered for distant aggressive warfare . In such a condition the military motive in its dangerous form would speedily die out ; all danger of its leading to wars of a political nature could be left to the ever-increasing development of the domestic spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their ideals , but exceedingly indisposed to die for purposes which they do not value . If the armed forces of governments should be brought to the admirable state in which they are established in Switzerland , the discreet philanthropist might well be satisfied to go no further . In the existing conditions of society , and , for all we can foresee , in any highly organized society whatsoever , there will always be need of using well organized force to restrain the large part of the population who are willing to seek their ends by violence . There is no other way to retain the good which has been won , or to win that which is before us , save by the law , and the sanction of the law is in strength . It is a sense of this truth which goes far to justify the existence of the great standing armies in the minds of many judicious persons , who fail to see that a well organized militia can be made as effective in attaining the same valuable end. , The foregoing considerations serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great nations the best placed to undertake the noble task of clearing away the worst of all the evitable evils which remain to man at the close of the century . Owing to our singular geographical position and to the well-established traditions of our government , we are the first great nation which has been able to adopt a policy of non-interference with the affairs of olher states . With the single lamentable exception of the Mexican war , where , as before noted , under the influence of motives which have passed away , we broke from our path , we have steadily avoided // aggressive wars . We have at the same time shown that a people thus withdrawn from the atmosphere of conflict can apply all needed power to the maintenance of its institutions and its ideals . With nothing to fear from abroad and with a well preserved indisposition to meddle with the problems of European politics , we are surely of all peoples the best fitted to undertake a movement to free the world from the evils of war . To those who desire to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , there is no other opportunity so good as this . Far better for our good name , or for the glory of that flag which only fools desire to see over battle fields , will be the enduring and blessed* memory that our country led in a campaign against the monstrous evils of battle . We can afford to make the offer of a mode in which this work may be done : if by chance the tender of good-will should fail of evident result , we shall at least have acted in a spirit which is true to our history and to the best which is in our people ; by the act we shall affirm our position to ourselves and to the rest of the world . It should be said that the project for action outlined in the preceding pages , as that which might be taken by a permanent commission of arbitration , is presented simply to meet the natural objection that there is no evident method whereby such a body could deal with the problem of war . The suggestions cover only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by such a board , so that if certain of them should prove to skilled pubheists and diplomats to be impracticable , there are others ready for consideration . The admirable example of the Alabama commission shows that questions which from their nature are the likeliest to lead to war may , if there be but the spirit of peace in the contestants , by wise counsellors be quietly adjusted . That adjustment shows us that the spirit of peace is active , that it needs but appropriate means to make its way . The means may be in our hands ; it is our duty to try if this be so.
