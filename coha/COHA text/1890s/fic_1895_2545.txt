I woke up very gradually this morning , and it took me a little while to bethink myself where I had slept -- that it had not been in my own room in the Cromwell Road . I lay a-bed , with eyes half-closed , drowsily look looking forward to the usual procession of sober-hued London hours , and , for the moment , quite forgot the journey of yesterday , and how it had left me in Paris , a guest in the smart new house of my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until somebody tapped on my door , and I roused myself to call out ' Come in , ' that I noticed the strangeness of the wall-paper , and then , after an instant of perplexity , suddenly remembered . Oh , with a wonderful lightening of the spirit , I can tell you . A white-capped , brisk young woman , with a fresh-coloured , wholesome peasant face , came in , bearing a tray -- Jeanne , Nina 's femme-de-chambre . ' Bonjour , monsieur , ' she cried cheerily . ' I bring monsieur his coffee . ' And her announcement was followed by a fragrance -- the softly-sung response of the coffee-sprite . Her tray , with its pretty freight of silver and linen , primrose butter , and gently-browned pain-de-gruau , she set down on the table at my elbow ; then she crossed the room and drew back the window-curtains , making the rings tinkle crisply on the metal rods , and letting in a gush of dazzling sunshine . From where I lay I could see the house-fronts opposite glow pearly-grey in shadow , and the crest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a black line on a sheet of scintillant blue velvet . Yet , a few minutes ago , I had been fancying myself in the Cromwell Road . Jeanne , gathering up my scattered garments , to take them off and brush them , inquired , by the way , if monsieur had passed a comfortable night . ' As the chambermaid makes your bed , so must you lie in it , ' I answered . ' And you know whether my bed was smoothly made . ' Jeanne smiled indulgently . But her next remark -- did it imply that she found me rusty ? ' Here 's a long time that you have n't been in Paris . ' ' Yes , ' I admitted ; ' not since May , and now we 're in November . ' ' We have changed things a little , have we not ? ' she demanded , with a gesture that left the room , and included the house , the street , the quarter . ' In effect , ' assented I. ' Monsieur desires his hot water ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least seem , abruptly irrelevant too . ' Mademoiselle -- is she up ? ' ' Ah , yes , monsieur . Mademoiselle has been up since eight . She awaits you in the salon . La voila qui joue , ' she added , pointing to the floor . Nina had begun to play scales in the room below . ' Then you may bring me my hot water , ' I said . II . The scales continued while I was dressing , and many desultory reminiscences of the player , and vague reflections upon the unlikelihood of her adventures , went flitting through my mind to their rhythm . Here she was , scarcely turned thirty , beautiful , brilliant , rich in her own right , as free in all respects to follow her own will as any man could be , with Camille happily at her side , a well grown , rosy , merry miss of twelve ,  - -  here was Nina , thus , to-day ; and yet , a mere little ten years ago , I remembered her ... ah , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than her deserts ; she has paid for her success , every pennyweight of it , in hard work and self-denial . But one is so expectant , here below , to see Fortune capricious , that , when for once in a way she bestows her favours where they are merited , one ca n't help feeling rather dazed . One is so inured to seeing honest Effort turn empty-handed from her door . Ten little years ago -- but no . I must begin further back . I must tell you something about Nina 's father . III . He was an Englishman who lived for the greater part of his life in Paris . I would say he was a painter , if he had not been equally a sculptor , a musician , an architect , a writer of verse , and a university coach . A doer of so many things is inevitably suspect ; you will imagine that he must have bungled them all . On the contrary , whatever he did , he did with a considerable degree of accomplishment . The landscapes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lots of air in them , and a dreamy , suggestive sentiment . His brother sculptors declared that his statuettes were modelled with exceeding dash and directness ; they were certainly fanciful and amusing . I remember one that I used to like immensely -- Titania driving to a tryst with Bottom , her chariot a lily , daisies for wheels , and for steeds a pair of mettlesome field-mice . I doubt if he ever got a commission for a complete house ; but the staircases he designed , the fire-places , and other bits of buildings , everybody thought original and graceful . The tunes he wrote were lively and catching , the words never stupid , sometimes even strikingly happy , epigrammatic ; and he sang them delightfully , in a robust , hearty baritone . He coached the youth of France , for their examinations , in Latin and Greek , in history , mathematics , general literature -- in goodness knows what not ; and his pupils failed so rarely that , when one did , the circumstance became a nine days ' wonder . The world beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he was a celebrity and a favourite ; and , strangely enough for a man with so many strings to his bow , he contrived to pick up a sufficient living . He was a splendid creature to look at , tall , stalwart , full-blooded , with a ruddy open-air complexion ; a fine bold brow and nose ; brown eyes , humorous , intelligent , kindly , that always brightened flatteringly when they met you ; and a vast quantity of bluish-grey hair and beard . In his dress he affected ( very wisely , for they became him excellently ) velvet jackets , flannel shirts , loosely-knotted ties , and wide-brimmed soft felt hats . Marching down the Boulevard St. Michel , his broad shoulders well thrown back , his head erect , chin high in air , his whole person radiating health , power , contentment , and the pride of them : he was a sight worth seeing , spirited , picturesque , prepossessing . You could not have passed him without noticing him -- without wondering who he was , confident he was somebody -- without admiring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interesting to know . He was , indeed , charming to know ; he was the hero , the idol , of a little sect of worshippers , young fellows who loved nothing better than to sit at his feet . On the Rive Gauche , to be sure , we are , for the most part , birds of passage ; a student arrives , tarries a little , then departs . So , with the exits and entrances of seniors and nouveaux , the personnel of old Childe 's following varied from season to season ; but numerically it remained pretty much the same . He had a studio , with a few living-rooms attached , somewhere up in the fastnesses of Montparnasse , though it was seldom thither that one went to seek him . He received at his cafe , the Cafe Bleu -- the Cafe Bleu which has since blown into the monster cafe of the Quarter , the noisiest , the rowdiest , the most flamboyant . But I am writing ( alas ) of twelve , thirteen , fifteen years ago ; in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanded floor , a dozen tables , and two waiters , Eugene and Hippolyte -- where Madame Chanve , the patronne , in lofty insulation behind her counter , reigned , if you please , but where Childe , her principal client , governed . The bottom of the shop , at any rate , was reserved exclusively to his use . There he dined , wrote his letters , dispensed his hospitalities ; he had his own piano there , if you can believe me , his foils and boxing-gloves ; from the absinthe hour till bed-time there was his habitat , his den . And woe to the passing stranger who , mistaking the Cafe Bleu for an ordinary house of call , ventured , during that consecrated period , to drop in . Nothing would be said , nothing done ; we would not even trouble to stare at the intruder . Yet he would seldom stop to finish his consommation , or he would bolt it . He would feel something in the air ; he would know he was out of place . He would fidget a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slink into the street . Human magnetism is such a subtle force . And Madame Chanve did n't mind in the least ; she preferred a bird in the hand to a brace in the bush . From half a dozen to a score of us dined at her long table every evening ; as many more drank her appetisers in the afternoon , and came again at night for grog or coffee . You see , it was a sort of club , a club of which Childe was at once the chairman and the object . If we had had a written constitution , it must have begun : ' The purpose of this association is the enjoyment of the society of Alfred Childe . ' Ah , those afternoons , those dinners , those ambrosial nights ! If the weather was kind , of course , we would begin our session on the terrasse , sipping our vermouth , puffing our cigarettes , laughing our laughs , tossing hither and thither our light ball of gossip , vaguely conscious of the perpetual ebb and flow and murmur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned Paris to a marvellous water-colour , all pale lucent tints , amber and alabaster and mother-of-pearl , with amethystine shadows . Then , one by one , those of us who were dining elsewhere would slip away ; and at a sign from Hippolyte the others would move indoors , and take their places down either side of the long narrow table , Childe at the head , his daughter Nina next him . And presently with what a clatter of knives and forks , clinking of glasses , and babble of human voices the Cafe Bleu would echo . Madame Chanve 's kitchen was not a thing to boast of , and her price , for the Latin Quarter , was rather high -- I think we paid three francs , wine included , which would be for most of us distinctly a prix-de-luxe . But oh , it was such fun ; we were so young ; Childe was so delightful . The fun was best , of course , when we were few , and could all sit up near to him , and none need lose a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scramble for good seats . I ask myself whether , if I could hear him again to-day , I should think his talk as wondrous as I thought it then . Then I could thrill at the verse of Musset , and linger lovingly over the prose of Theophile , I could laugh at the wit of Gustave Droz , and weep at the pathos ... it costs me a pang to own it , but yes , I 'm afraid ... I could weep at the pathos of Henry Muerger ; and these have all suffered such a sad sea-change since . So I could sit , hour after hour , in a sort of ecstasy , listening to the talk of Nina 's father . It flowed from him like wine from a full measure , easily , smoothly , abundantly . He had a ripe , genial voice , and an enunciation that made crystals of his words ; whilst his range of subjects was as wide as the earth and the sky . He would talk to you of God and man , of metaphysics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of ministry ; of books , of pictures , specifically , or of the general principles of literature and painting ; of people , of sunsets , of Italy , of the high seas , of the Paris streets -- of what , in fine , you pleased . Or he would spin you yarns , sober , farcical , veridical , or invented . And , with transitions infinitely rapid , he would be serious , jocose -- solemn , ribald -- earnest , flippant -- logical , whimsical , turn and turn about . And in every sentence , in its form or in its substance , he would wrap a surprise for you -- it was the unexpected word , the unexpected assertion , sentiment , conclusion , that constantly arrived . Meanwhile it would enhance your enjoyment mightily to watch his physiognomy , the movements of his great , grey , shaggy head , the lightening and darkening of his eyes , his smile , his frown , his occasional slight shrug or gesture . But the oddest thing was this , that he could take as well as give ; he could listen -- surely a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a man who could make you feel so interesting . After dinner he would light an immense brown meerschaum pipe , and smoke for a quarter-hour or so in silence ; then he would play a game or two of chess with some one ; and by and by he would open his piano , and sing to us till midnight . IV . I speak of him as old , and indeed we always called him Old Childe among ourselves ; yet he was barely fifty . Nina , when I first made her acquaintance , must have been a girl of sixteen or seventeen ; though -- tall , with an amply-rounded , mature-seeming figure -- if one had judged from her appearance , one would have fancied her three or four years older . For that matter , she looked then very much as she looks now ; I can perceive scarcely any alteration . She had the same dark hair , gathered up in a big smooth knot behind , and breaking into a tumult of little ringlets over her forehead ; the same clear , sensitive complexion ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft chin , and merry mischievous eyes . She moved in the same way , with the same leisurely , almost lazy grace , that could , however , on occasions , quicken to an alert , elastic vivacity ; she had the same voice , a trifle deeper than most women 's , and of a quality never so delicately nasal , which made it racy and characteristic ; the same fresh ready laughter . There was something arch , something a little sceptical , a little quizzical in her expression , as if , perhaps , she were disposed to take the world , more or less , with a grain of salt ; at the same time there was something rich , warm-blooded , luxurious , suggesting that she would know how to savour its pleasantnesses with complete enjoyment . But if you felt that she was by way of being the least bit satirical in her view of things , you felt too that she was altogether good-natured , and even that , at need , she could show herself spontaneously kind , generous , devoted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensuous than the ascetic , believe me , it did not lessen her attractiveness . At the time of which I am writing now , the sentiment that reigned between Nina and Old Childe 's retinue of young men was chiefly an esprit-de-corps . Later on we all fell in love with her ; but for the present we were simply amiably fraternal . We were united to her by a common enthusiasm ; we were fellow-celebrants at her ancestral altar -- or , rather , she was the high priestess there , we were her acolytes . For , with her , filial piety did in very truth partake of the nature of religion ; she really , literally , idolised her father . One only needed to watch her for three minutes , as she sat beside him , to understand the depth and ardour of her emotion : how she adored him , how she admired him and believed in him , how proud of him she was , how she rejoiced in him . ' Oh , you think you know my father , ' I remember her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody is great enough to know him . If people knew him they would fall down and kiss the ground he walks on . ' It is certain she deemed him the wisest , the noblest , the handsomest , the most gifted , of human kind . That little gleam of mockery in her eye died out instantly when she looked at him , when she spoke of him or listened to him ; instead , there came a tender light of love , and her face grew pale with the fervour of her affection . Yet , when he jested , no one laughed more promptly or more heartily than she . In those days I was perpetually trying to write fiction ; and Old Childe was my inveterate hero . I forget in how many ineffectual manuscripts , under what various dread disguises , he was afterwards reduced to ashes ; I am afraid , in one case , a scandalous distortion of him got abroad in print . Publishers are sometimes ill-advised ; and thus the indiscretions of our youth may become the confusions of our age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself a novel ; and of course the fatuous author had to make a bad business worse by presenting a copy to his victim . I shall never forget the look Nina gave me when I asked her if she had read it ; I grow hot even now as I recall it . I had waited and waited expecting her compliments ; and at last I could wait no longer , and so asked her ; and she answered me with a look ! It was weeks , I am not sure it was n't months , before she took me back to her good graces . But Old Childe was magnanimous ; he sent me a little pencil-drawing of his head , inscribed in the corner , ' To Frankenstein from his Monster . ' V. It was a queer life for a girl to live , that happy-go-lucky life of the Latin Quarter , lawless and unpremeditated , with a cafe for her school-room , and none but men for comrades ; but Nina liked it ; and her father had a theory in his madness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in principle ; he preached Bohemianism as the most rational manner of existence , maintaining that it developed what was intrinsic and authentic in one 's character , saved one from the artificial , and brought one into immediate contact with the realities of the world ; and he protested he could see no reason why a human being should be ' cloistered and contracted ' because of her sex . ' What would not hurt my son , if I had one , will not hurt my daughter . It will make a man of her -- without making her the less a woman . ' So he took her with him to the Cafe Bleu , and talked in her presence quite as freely as he might have talked had she been absent . As , in the greater number of his theological , political , and social convictions , he was exceedingly unorthodox , she heard a good deal , no doubt , that most of us would scarcely consider edifying for our daughters ' ears ; but he had his system , he knew what he was about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undefiled , ' he said , ' depends altogether upon the spirit in which you approach it . The realities of the world , the realities of life , the real things of God 's universe -- what have we eyes for , if not to envisage them ? Do so fearlessly , honestly , with a clean heart , and , man or woman , you can only be the better for it . ' Perhaps his system was a shade too simple , a shade too obvious , for this complicated planet ; but he held to it in all sincerity . It was in pursuance of the same system , I daresay , that he taught Nina to fence , and to read Latin and Greek , as well as to play the piano , and turn an omelette . She could ply a foil against the best of us . And then , quite suddenly , he died . I think it was in March , or April ; anyhow it was a premature spring-like day , and he had left off his overcoat . That evening he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he joined us for supper at the Bleu , he said he thought he had caught a cold , and ordered hot grog . The next day he did not turn up at all ; so several of us , after dinner , presented ourselves at his lodgings in Montparnasse . We found him in bed , with Nina reading to him . He was feverish , and Nina had insisted that he should stop at home . He would be all right to-morrow . He scoffed at our suggestion that he should see a doctor ; he was one of those men who affect to despise the medical profession . But early on the following morning a commissionnaire brought me a note from Nina . ' My father is very much worse . Can you come at once ? ' He was delirious . Poor Nina , white , with frightened eyes , moved about like one distracted . We sent off for Dr. Renoult , we had in a Sister of Charity . Everything that could be done was done . Till the very end , none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible to conceive that that strong , affirmative life could be extinguished . And even after the end had come , the end with its ugly suite of material circumstances , I do n't think any of us realised what it meant . It was as if we had been told that one of the forces of Nature had become inoperative . And Nina , through it all , was like some pale thing in marble , that breathed and moved : white , dazed , helpless , with aching , incredulous eyes , suffering everything , understanding nothing . When it came to the worst of the dreadful necessary businesses that followed , some of us somehow , managed to draw her from the death-chamber into another room , and to keep her there , while others of us got it over . It was snowing that afternoon , I remember , a melancholy , hesitating snowstorm , with large moist flakes that fluttered down irresolutely , and presently disintegrated into rain ; but we had not far to go . Then we returned to Nina , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will guess whether the question of her future , especially of her immediate future , weighed heavily upon our minds . In the end , however , it appeared to have solved itself -- though I ca n't pretend that the solution was exactly all we could have wished . Her father had a half-brother ( we learned this from his papers ) , incumbent of rather an important living in the north of England . We also learned that the brothers had scarcely seen each other twice in a score of years , and had kept up only the most fitful correspondence . Nevertheless , we wrote to the clergyman , describing the sad case of his niece , and in reply we got a letter , addressed to Nina herself , saying that of course she must come at once to Yorkshire , and consider the rectory her home . I do n't need to recount the difficulties we had in explaining to her , in persuading her . I have known few more painful moments than that when , at the Gare du Nord , half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her compartment , and sent her , with our godspeed , alone upon her long journey -- to her strange kindred , and the strange conditions of life she would have to encounter among them . From the Cafe Bleu to a Yorkshire parsonage ! And Nina 's was not by any means a neutral personality , nor her mind a blank sheet of paper . She had a will of her own ; she had convictions , aspirations , traditions , prejudices , which she would hold to with enthusiasm because they had been her father 's , because her father had taught them to her ; and she had manners , habits , tastes . She would be sure to horrify the people she was going to ; she would be sure to resent their criticism , their slightest attempt at interference . Oh , my heart was full of misgivings ; yet -- she had no money , she was eighteen years old -- what else could we advise her to do ? All the same , her face , as it looked down upon us from the window of her railway carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze of blank uncomprehending anguish , kept rising up to reproach me for weeks afterwards . I had her on my conscience as if I had personally wronged her . VI . It was characteristic of her that , during her absence , she hardly wrote to us . She is of far too hasty and impetuous a nature to take kindly to the task of letter-writing ; her moods are too inconstant ; her thoughts , her fancies , supersede one another too rapidly . Anyhow , beyond the telegram we had made her promise to send , announcing her safe arrival , the most favoured of us got nothing more than an occasional scrappy note , if he got so much ; while the greater number of the long epistles some of us felt in duty bound to address to her , elicited not even the semblance of an acknowledgment . Hence , about the particulars of her experience we were quite in the dark , though of its general features we were informed , succinctly , in a big , dashing , uncompromising hand , that she ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it was late in April or early in May that Nina left us . But one day towards the middle of October , coming home from the restaurant where I had lunched , I found in my letter box , in the concierge 's room , two half sheets of paper , folded , with the corners turned down , and my name superscribed in pencil . The handwriting startled me a little -- and yet , no , it was impossible . Then I hastened to unfold , and read , and of course it was the impossible which had happened . ' Mon cher , I am sorry not to find you at home , but I 'll wait at the cafe at the corner till half-past twelve . It is now midi juste . ' That was the first . The second ran : ' I have waited till a quarter to one . Now I am going to the Bleu for luncheon . I shall be there till three . ' And each was signed with the initials , N.C. It was not yet two , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't loiter on that account . I dashed out of the loge -- into the street -- down the Boulevard St. Michel -- into the Bleu , breathlessly . At the far end Nina was seated before a marble table , with Madame Chanve in smiles and tears beside her . I heard a little cry ; I felt myself seized and enveloped for a moment by something like a whirlwind -- oh , but a very pleasant whirlwind , warm and fresh , and fragrant of violets ; I received two vigorous kisses , one on either cheek ; and then I was held off at arm 's length , and examined by a pair of laughing eyes . And at last a voice -- rather a deep voice for a woman 's , with just a crisp edge to it , that might have been called slightly nasal , but was agreeable and individual -- a voice said : ' En voila assez . Come and sit down . ' She had finished her luncheon , and was taking coffee ; and if the whole truth must be told , I 'm afraid she was taking it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black frock , with a bunch of violets in her breast , and a hat with a sweeping black feather and a daring brim . Her dark luxurious hair broke into a riot of fluffy little curls about her forehead , and thence waved richly away to where it was massed behind ; her cheeks glowed with a lovely colour ( thanks , doubtless , to Yorkshire breezes ; sweet are the uses of adversity ) ; her eyes sparkled ; her lips curved in a perpetual play of smiles , letting her delicate little teeth show themselves furtively ; and suddenly I realised that this girl , whom I had never thought of save as one might think of one 's younger sister , suddenly I realised that she was a woman , and a radiantly , perhaps even a dangerously handsome woman . I saw suddenly that she was not merely an attribute , an aspect , of another , not merely Alfred Childe 's daughter ; she was a personage in herself , a personage to be reckoned with . This sufficiently obvious perception came upon me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dare say for a little while I sat vacantly staring at her , with an air of preoccupation . Anyhow , all at once she laughed , and cried out , ' Well , when you get back ... ? ' and , ' Perhaps , ' she questioned , ' perhaps you think it polite to go off wool-gathering like that ? ' Whereupon I recovered myself with a start , and laughed too . ' But say that you are surprised , say that you are glad , at least , ' she went on . Surprised ! glad ! But what did it mean ? What was it all about ? ' I could n't stand it any longer , that 's all . I have come home . Oh , que c'est bon , que c'est bon , que c'est bon ! ' ' And -- England ?  - -  Yorkshire ? your people ? ' ' Do n't speak of it . It was a bad dream . It is over . It brings bad luck to speak of bad dreams . I have forgotten it . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And she smiled blissfully through eyes filled with tears . Do n't tell me that happiness is an illusion . It is her habit , if you will , to flee before us and elude us ; but sometimes , sometimes we catch up with her , and can hold her for long moments warm against our hearts . ' Oh , mon pere ! It is enough -- to be here , where he lived , where he worked , where he was happy , ' Nina murmured afterwards . She had arrived the night before ; she had taken a room in the Hotel d'Espagne , in the Rue de Medicis , opposite the Luxembourg Garden . I was as yet the only member of the old set she had looked up . Of course I knew where she had gone first -- but not to cry -- to kiss it -- to place flowers on it . She could not cry -- not now . She was too happy , happy , happy . Oh , to be back in Paris , her home , where she had lived with him , where every stick and stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing up at the clock , with an abrupt change of key , ' Mais allons donc , paresseux ! You must take me to see the camarades . You must take me to see Chalks . ' And in the street she put her arm through mine , laughing and saying , ' On nous croira fiances . ' She did not walk , she tripped , she all but danced beside me , chattering joyously in alternate French and English . ' I could stop and kiss them all -- the men , the women , the very pavement . Oh , Paris ! Oh , these good , gay , kind Parisians ! Look at the sky ! Look at the view -- down that impasse -- the sunlight and shadows on the houses , the doorways , the people . Oh , the air ! Oh , the smells ! Que c'est bon -- que je suis contente ! Et dire que j'ai passe cinq mois , mais cinq grands mois , en Angleterre . Ah , veinard , you -- you do n't know how you 're blessed . ' Presently we found ourselves labouring knee-deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucked her bunch of violets from her breast , and was dropping them amongst eager fingers and rosy cherubic smiles . And it was constantly , ' Tiens , there 's Madame Chose in her kiosque . Bonjour , madame . Vous allez toujours bien ? ' and ' Oh , look ! old Perronet standing before his shop in his shirt-sleeves , exactly as he has stood at this hour every day , winter or summer , these ten years . Bonjour , M'sieu Perronet . ' And you may be sure that the kindly French Choses and Perronets returned her greetings with beaming faces . ' Ah , mademoiselle , que c'est bon de vous revoir ainsi . Que vous avez bonne mine ! ' ' It is so strange , ' she said , ' to find nothing changed . To think that everything has gone on quietly in the usual way . As if I had n't spent an eternity in exile ! ' And at the corner of one street , before a vast flaunting ' bazaar , ' with a prodigality of tawdry Oriental wares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like beetles in and out amongst them , ' Oh , ' she cried , ' the " Mecque du Quartier " ! To think that I could weep for joy at seeing the " Mecque du Quartier " ! ' By and by we plunged into a dark hallway , climbed a long , unsavoury , corkscrew staircase , and knocked at a door . A gruff voice having answered , ' ' Trez ! ' we entered Chalks 's bare , bleak , paint-smelling studio . He was working ( from a lay-figure ) with his back towards us ; and he went on working for a minute or two after our arrival , without speaking . Then he demanded , in a sort of grunt , ' Eh bien , qu'est ce que c'est ? ' always without pausing in his work or looking round . Nina gave two little ahems , tense with suppressed mirth ; and slowly , indifferently , Chalks turned an absent-minded face in our direction . But , next instant , there was a shout -- a rush -- a confusion of forms in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to be honoured by a kiss and an embrace . ' Oh , you 're covering me with paint , ' Nina protested suddenly ; and indeed he had forgotten to drop his brush and palette , and great dabs of colour were clinging to her cloak . While he was doing penance , scrubbing the garment with rags soaked in turpentine , he kept shaking his head , and murmuring , from time to time , as he glanced up at her , ' Well , I 'll be dumned . ' ' It 's very nice and polite of you , Chalks , ' she said , by and by , ' a very graceful concession to my sex . But , if you think it would relieve you once for all , you have my full permission to pronounce it  - -  amned . ' Chalks did no more work that afternoon ; and that evening quite twenty of us dined at Madame Chanve 's ; and it was almost like old times . VIII . ' Oh , yes , ' she explained to me afterwards , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins are very good women . But for me , to live with them -- pas possible , mon cher . Their thoughts were not my thoughts , we could not speak the same language . They disapproved of me unutterably . They suffered agonies , poor things . Oh , they were very kind , very patient . But --  ! My gods were their devils . My father -- my great , grand , splendid father -- was " poor Alfred , " " poor uncle Alfred . " Que voulez-vous ? And then -- the life , the society ! The parishioners -- the people who came to tea -- the houses where we sometimes dined ! Are you interested in crops ? In the preservation of game ? In the diseases of cattle ? Olala ! ( C'est bien le cas de s'en servir , de cette expression-la . ) Olala , lala ! And then -- have you ever been homesick ? Oh , I longed , I pined , for Paris , as one suffocating would long , would die , for air . Enfin , I could not stand it any longer . They thought it wicked to smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed-room ! Oh , her face ! I had to sneak away , behind the shrubbery at the end of the garden , for stealthy whiffs . And it was impossible to get French tobacco . At last I took the bull by the horns , and fled . It will have been a terrible shock for them . But better one good blow than endless little ones ; better a lump-sum than instalments with interest . ' But what was she going to do ? How was she going to live ? For , after all , much as she loved Paris , she could n't subsist on its air and sunshine . ' Oh , never fear ! I 'll manage somehow . I 'll not die of hunger , ' she said confidently . IX . And , sure enough , she managed very well . She gave music lessons to the children of the Quarter , and English lessons to clerks and shop girls ; she did a little translating ; she would pose now and then for a painter friend -- she was the original , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . She even -- thanks to the employment by Chalks of what he called his ' inflooence ' she even contributed a weekly column of Paris gossip to the Palladium , a newspaper published at Battle Creek , Michigan , U.S.A. , Chalks 's native town . ' Put in lots about me , and talk as if there were only two important centres of civilisation on earth , Battle Crick and Parus , and it 'll be a boom , ' Chalks said . We used to have great fun , concocting those columns of Paris gossip . Nina , indeed , held the pen and cast a deciding vote ; but we all collaborated . And we put in lots about Chalks -- perhaps rather more than he had bargained for . With an irony ( we trusted ) too subtle to be suspected by the good people of Battle Creek , we would introduce their illustrious fellow-citizen , casually , between the Pope and the President of the Republic ; we would sketch him as he strolled in the Boulevard arm-in-arm with Monsieur Meissonier , as he dined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bock in the afternoon with the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour ; we would compose solemn descriptive criticisms of his works , which almost made us die of laughing ; we would interview him -- at length -- about any subject ; we would give elaborate bulletins of his health , and brilliant pen-pictures of his toilets . Sometimes we would betroth him , marry him , divorce him ; sometimes , when our muse impelled us to a particularly daring flight , we would insinuate , darkly , sorrowfully , that perhaps the great man 's morals ... but no ! We were persuaded that rumour accused him falsely . The story that he had been seen dancing at Bullier 's with the notorious Duchesse de Z --  --  was a baseless fabrication . Unprincipled ? Oh , we were nothing if not unprincipled . And our pleasure was so exquisite , and it worried our victim so . ' I suppose you think it 's funny , do n't you ? ' he used to ask , with a feint of superior scorn which put its fine flower to our hilarity . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would warn us , the only unconvulsed member present . ' By gum , you 're easily amused . ' We always wrote of him respectfully as Mr. Charles K. Smith ; we never faintly hinted at his sobriquet . We would have rewarded liberally , at that time , any one who could have told us what the K. stood for . We yearned to unite the cryptic word to his surname by a hyphen ; the mere abstract notion of doing so filled us with fearful joy . Chalks was right , I dare say ; we were easily amused . And Nina , at these moments of literary frenzy -- I can see her now : her head bent over the manuscript , her hair in some disarray , a spiral of cigarette-smoke winding ceilingward from between the fingers of her idle hand , her lips parted , her eyes gleaming with mischievous inspirations , her face pale with the intensity of her glee . I can see her as she would look up , eagerly , to listen to somebody 's suggestion , or as she would motion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got an idea . ' Then her pen would dash swiftly , noisily , over her paper for a little , whilst we all waited expectantly ; and at last she would lean back , drawing a long breath , and tossing the pen aside , to read her paragraph out to us . In a word , she managed very well , and by no means died of hunger . She could scarcely afford Madame Chanve 's three-franc table d'hote , it is true ; but we could dine modestly at Leon 's , over the way , and return to the Bleu for coffee ,  - -  though , it must be added , that establishment no longer enjoyed a monopoly of our custom . We patronised it and the Vachette , the Source , the Ecoles , the Souris , indifferently . Or we would sometimes spend our evenings in Nina 's rooms . She lived in a tremendously swagger house in the Avenue de l'Observatoire ,  - -  on the sixth floor , to be sure , but ' there was a carpet all the way up . ' She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano ( the same that had formerly embellished our cafe ) , and no end of books , pictures , draperies , and pretty things , inherited from her father or presented by her friends . By this time the inevitable had happened , and we were all in love with her ,  - -  hopelessly , resignedly so , and without internecine rancour , for she treated us , indiscriminately , with a serene , impartial , tolerant , derision ; but we were savagely , luridly , jealous and suspicious of all new-comers and of all outsiders . If we could not win her , no one else should ; and we formed ourselves round her in a ring of fire . Oh , the maddening , mock-sentimental , mock-sympathetic face she would pull , when one of us ventured to sigh to her of his passion ! The way she would lift her eyebrows , and gaze at you with a travesty of pity , shaking her head pensively , and murmuring , ' Mon pauvre ami ! Only fancy ! ' And then how the imp , lurking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretence of trying to conceal himself , would suddenly leap forth in a peal of laughter ! She had lately read Mr. Howells 's ' Undiscovered Country , ' and had adopted the Shakers ' paraphrase for love : ' Feeling foolish . '  - -  'Feeling pretty foolish to-day , air ye , gentlemen ? ' she inquired , mimicking the dialect of Chalks . ' Well , I guess you just ai n't feeling any more foolish than you look . '  - -  If she would but have taken us seriously ! And the worst of it was that we knew she was anything but temperamentally cold . Chalks formulated the potentialities we divined in her , when he remarked , regretfully , wistfully , as he often did , ' She could love like Hell . ' Once , in a reckless moment , he even went so far as to tell her this pointblank . ' Oh , naughty Chalks ! ' she remonstrated , shaking her finger at him . ' Do you think that 's a pretty word ? But -- I dare say I could . ' ' All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Chalks continued gloomily . ' Oh , I shall never marry , ' Nina cried . ' Because , first , I do n't approve of matrimony as an institution . And then -- as you say -- Lord help my husband . I should be such an uncomfortable wife . So capricious , and flighty , and tantalising , and unsettling , and disobedient , and exacting , and everything . Oh , but a horrid wife ! No , I shall never marry . Marriage is quite too out-of-date . I sha n't marry ; but , if I ever meet a man and love him -- ah ! ' She placed two fingers upon her lips , and kissed them , and waved the kiss to the skies . This fragment of conversation passed in the Luxembourg Garden ; and the three or four of us by whom she was accompanied glared threateningly at our mental image of that not-impossible upstart whom she might some day meet and love . We were sure , of course , that he would be a beast ; we hated him not merely because he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so distinctly our inferior , so hopelessly unworthy of her , so helplessly incapable of appreciating her . I think we conceived of him as tall , with drooping fair moustaches , and contemptibly meticulous in his dress . He would probably not be of the Quarter ; he would sneer at us . ' He 'll not understand her , he 'll not respect her . Take her peculiar views . We know where she gets them . But he -- he 'll despise her for them , at the very time he 's profiting by ' em , ' some one said . Her peculiar views of the institution of matrimony , the speaker meant . She had got them from her father . ' The relations of the sexes should be as free as friendship , ' he had taught . ' If a man and a woman love each other , it is nobody 's business but their own . Neither the Law nor Society can , with any show of justice , interfere . That they do interfere , is a survival of feudalism , a survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had no liberty , no rights . If a man and a woman love each other , they should be as free to determine for themselves the character , extent , and duration of their intercourse , as two friends should be . If they wish to live together under the same roof , let them . If they wish to retain their separate domiciles , let them . If they wish to cleave to each other till death severs them -- if they wish to part on the morrow of their union -- let them , by heaven . But the couple who go before a priest or a magistrate , and bind themselves in ceremonial marriage , are serving to perpetuate tyranny , are insulting the dignity of human nature . ' Such was the gospel which Nina had absorbed ( do n't , for goodness ' sake , imagine that I approve of it because I cite it ) , and which she professed in entire good faith . We felt that the coming man would misapprehend both it and her -- though he would not hesitate to make a convenience of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in a ring of fire , hoping to frighten the beast away . But we were miserably , fiercely , anxious , suspicious , jealous . We were jealous of everything in the shape of a man that came into any sort of contact with her : of the men who passed her in the street or rode with her in the omnibus ; of the little employes de commerce to whom she gave English lessons ; of everybody . I fancy we were always more or less uneasy in our minds when she was out of our sight . Who could tell what might be happening ? With those lips of hers , those eyes of hers -- oh , we knew how she could love : Chalks had said it . Who could tell what might already have happened ? Who could tell that the coming man had not already come ? She was entirely capable of concealing him from us . Sometimes , in the evening , she would seem absent , preoccupied . How could we be sure that she was n't thinking of him ? Savouring anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or dreaming of those she had promised him for to-morrow ? If she took leave of us -- might he not be waiting to join her round the corner ? If she spent an evening away from us .... And she -- she only laughed ; laughed at our jealousy , our fears , our precautions , as she laughed at our hankering flame . Not a laugh that reassured us , though ; an inscrutable , enigmatic laugh , that might have covered a multitude of sins . She had taken to calling us collectively Loulou . ' Ah , le pauv ' Loulou -- so now he has the pretension to be jealous . ' Then she would be interrupted by a paroxysm of laughter ; after which , ' Oh , qu'il est drole , ' she would gasp . ' Pourvu qu'il ne devienne pas genant ! ' It was all very well to laugh ; but some of us , our personal equation quite apart , could not help feeling that the joke was of a precarious quality , that the situation held tragic possibilities . A young and attractive girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heterodox ideas of marriage -- alone in the Latin Quarter . X. I have heard it maintained that the man has yet to be born , who , in his heart of hearts , if he comes to think the matter over , wo n't find himself at something of a loss to conceive why any given woman should experience the passion of love for any other man ; that a woman 's choice , to all men save the chosen , is , by its very nature , as incomprehensible as the postulates of Hegel . But , in Nina 's case , even when I regard it from this distance of time , I still feel , as we all felt then , that the mystery was more than ordinarily obscure . We had fancied ourselves prepared for anything ; the only thing we were n't prepared for was the thing that befell . We had expected ' him ' to be offensive , and he was n't . He was , quite simply , insignificant . He was a South American , a Brazilian , a member of the School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritless , apologetic creature , with rather a Teutonic-looking name , Ernest Mayer . His father , or uncle , was Minister of Agriculture , or Commerce , or something , in his native land ; and he himself was attached in some nominal capacity to the Brazilian Legation , in the Rue de Teheran , whence , on state occasions , he enjoyed the privilege of enveloping his meagre little person in a very gorgeous diplomatic uniform . He was beardless , with vague features , timid , light-blue eyes , and a bluish , anaemic skin . In manner he was nervous , tremulous , deprecatory -- perpetually bowing , wriggling , stepping back to let you pass , waving his hands , palms outward , as if to protest against giving you trouble . And in speech -- upon my word , I do n't think I ever heard him compromise himself by any more dangerous assertion than that the weather was fine , or he wished you good-day . For the most part he listened mutely , with a nickering , perfunctory smile . From time to time , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent , deadly breach , he would hazard an ' Ah , oui , ' or a ' Pas mal . ' For the rest , he played the piano prettily enough , wrote colourless , correct French verse , and was reputed to be an industrious if not a brilliant student -- what we called un serieux . It was hard to believe that beautiful , sumptuous Nina Childe , with her wit , her humour , her imagination , loved this neutral little fellow ; yet she made no secret of doing so . We tried to frame a theory that would account for it . ' It 's the maternal instinct , ' suggested one . ' It 's her chivalry , ' said another ; ' she 's the sort of woman who could never be very violently interested by a man of her own size . She would need one she could look up to , or else one she could protect and pat on the head . ' ' " God be thanked , the meanest of His creatures boasts two soul-sides , one to face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves her , " ' quoted a third . ' Perhaps Coco '  - -  we had nicknamed him Coco -- 'has luminous qualities that we do n't dream of , to which he gives the rein when they 're a deux . ' Anyhow , if we were mortified that she should have preferred such a one to us , we were relieved to think that she had n't fallen into the clutches of a blackguard , as we had feared she would . That Coco was a blackguard we never guessed . We made the best of him , because we had to choose between doing that and seeing less of Nina : in time , I am afraid -- such is the influence of habit -- we rather got to like him , as one gets to like any innocuous , customary thing . And if we did not like the situation -- for none of us , whatever might have been our practice , shared Nina 's hereditary theories anent the sexual conventions -- we recognised that we could n't alter it , and we shrugged our shoulders resignedly , trusting it might be no worse . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I are going to be married . ' And when we cried out why , she explained that -- despite her own conviction that marriage was a barbarous institution -- she felt , in the present state of public opinion , people owed legitimacy to their children . So Ernest , who , according to both French and Brazilian law , could not , at his age , marry without his parents ' consent , was going home to procure it . He would sail next week ; he would be back before three months . Ernest sailed from Lisbon ; and the post , a day or two after he was safe at sea , brought Nina a letter from him . It was a wild , hysterical , remorseful letter , in which he called himself every sort of name . He said his parents would never dream of letting him marry her . They were Catholics , they were very devout , they had prejudices , they had old-fashioned notions . Besides , he had been as good as affianced to a lady of their election ever since he was born . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XI . Shortly after the birth of Camille I had to go to London , and it was nearly a year before I came back to Paris . Nina was looking better than when I had left , but still in nowise like her old self -- pale and worn and worried , with a smile that was the ghost of her former one . She had been waiting for my return , she said , to have a long talk with me . ' I have made a little plan . I want you to advise me . Of course you must advise me to stick to it . ' And when we had reached her lodgings , and were alone in the salon , ' It is about Camille , it is about her bringing-up , ' she explained . ' The Latin Quarter ? It is all very well for you , for me ; but for a growing child ? Oh , my case was different ; I had my father . But Camille ? Restaurants , cafes , studios , the Boul ' Miche , and this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no -- I am not a renegade . I am a Bohemian ; I shall always be ; it is bred in the bone .

And I distrust myself ; I have no " system . " Shall I not do better , then , to adopt the system of the world ? To give her the conventional education , the conventional " advantages " ? A home , what they call home influences . Then , when she has grown up , she can choose for herself . Besides , there is the question of francs and centimes . I have been able to earn a living for myself , it is true . But even that is more difficult now ; I can give less time to work ; I am in debt . And we are two ; and our expenses must naturally increase from year to year . And I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bad principle when you have a growing child . ' After a little pause she went on , ' So my problem is , first , how to earn our livelihood , and secondly , how to make something like a home for Camille , something better than this tobacco-smoky , absinthe-scented atmosphere of the Latin Quarter . And I can see only one way of accomplishing the two things . You will smile -- but I have considered it from every point of view . I have examined myself , my own capabilities . I have weighed all the chances . I wish to take a flat , in another quarter of the town , near the Etoile or the Parc Monceau , and -- open a pension . There is my plan . ' I had a much simpler and pleasanter plan of my own , but of that , as I knew , she would hear nothing . I did not smile at hers , however ; though I confess it was not easy to imagine madcap Nina in the role of a landlady , regulating the accounts and presiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend that I believed there was the slightest likelihood of her filling it with success . But I said nothing to discourage her ; and the fact that she is rich to-day proves how little I divined the resources of her character . For the boarding-house she kept was an exceedingly good boarding-house ; she showed herself the most practical of mistresses ; and she prospered amazingly . Jeanselme , whose father had recently died , leaving him a fortune , lent her what money she needed to begin with ; she took and furnished a flat in the Avenue de l'Alma ; and I -- I feel quite like an historical personage when I remember that I was her first boarder . Others soon followed me , though , for she had friends amongst all the peoples of the earth -- English and Americans , Russians , Italians , Austrians , even Roumanians and Servians , as well as French ; and each did what he could to help . At the end of a year she overflowed into the flat above ; then into that below ; then she acquired the lease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it early and late , her eyes were everywhere ; she set an excellent table ; she employed admirable servants ; and if her prices were a bit stiff , she gave you your money 's worth , and there were no ' surprises . ' It was comfortable and quiet ; the street was bright ; the neighbourhood convenient . You could dine in the common salle-a-manger if you liked , or in your private sitting-room . And you never saw your landlady except for purposes of business . She lived apart , in the entresol , alone with Camille and her body-servant Jeanne . There was the ' home ' she had set out to make . Meanwhile another sort of success was steadily thrusting itself upon her -- she certainly never went out of her way to seek it ; she was much too busy to do that . Such of her old friends as remained in Paris came frequently to see her , and new friends gathered round her . She was beautiful , she was intelligent , responsive , entertaining . In her salon , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at large in the town -- authors , painters , actors , actresses , deputies , even an occasional Cabinet minister . Red ribbons and red rosettes shone from every corner of the room . She had become one of the oligarchs of la haute Boheme , she had become one of the celebrities of Paris . It would be tiresome to count the novels , poems , songs , that were dedicated to her , the portraits of her , painted or sculptured , that appeared at the Mirlitons or the Palais de l'Industrie . Numberless were the partis who asked her to marry them ( I know one , at least , who has returned to the charge again and again ) , but she only laughed , and vowed she would never marry . I do n't say that she has never had her fancies , her experiences ; but she has consistently scoffed at marriage . At any rate , she has never affected the least repentance for what some people would call her ' fault . ' Her ideas of right and wrong have undergone very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of Ernest Mayer , if you please ; but she would indignantly deny that there was anything sinful , anything to be ashamed of , in her relations with him . And if , by reason of them , she at one time suffered a good deal of pain , I am sure she accounts Camille an exceeding great compensation . That Camille is her child she would scorn to make a secret . She has scorned to assume the conciliatory title of Madame . As plain Mademoiselle , with a daughter , you must take her or leave her . And , somehow , all this has not seemed to make the faintest difference to her clientele , not even to the primmest of the English . I ca n't think of one of them who did not treat her with deference , like her , and recommend her house . But her house they need recommend no more , for she has sold it . Last spring , when I was in Paris , she told me she was about to do so . ' Ouf ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am going to " retire . " ' What money she had saved from season to season , she explained , she had entrusted to her friend Baron C --  -- for speculation . ' He is a wizard , and so I am a rich woman . I shall have an income of something like three thousand pounds , mon cher ! Oh , we will roll in it . I have had ten bad years -- ten hateful years . You do n't know how I have hated it all , this business , this drudgery , this cut-and-dried , methodical existence -- moi , enfant de Boheme ! But , enfin , it was obligatory . Now we will change all that . Nous reviendrons a nos premieres amours . I shall have ten good years -- ten years of barefaced pleasure . Then -- I will range myself -- perhaps .

' But for me ? Where shall I stop when I come to Paris ? ' ' With me . You shall be my guest . I will kill you if you ever go elsewhere . You shall pass your old age in a big chair in the best room , and Camille and I will nurse your gout and make herb-tea for you . ' ' And I shall sit and think of what might have been . ' ' Yes , we 'll indulge all your little foibles . You shall sit and " feel foolish "  - -  from dawn to dewy eve . ' XII . If you had chanced to be walking in the Bois-de-Boulogne this afternoon , you might have seen a smart little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and driven by a woman -- a woman with sparkling eyes , a lovely colour , great quantities of soft dark hair , and a figure --  ' Helas , mon pere , la taille d'une deesse '  --  a smiling woman , in a wonderful blue-grey toilet , grey driving gloves , and a bold-brimmed grey-felt hat with waving plumes . And in the man beside her you would have recognised your servant . You would have thought me in great luck , perhaps you would have envied me . But -- esse , quam videri !  - -  I would I were as enviable as I looked . MERCEDES When I was a child some one gave me a family of white mice . I do n't remember how old I was , I think about ten or eleven ; but I remember very clearly the day I received them . It must have been a Thursday , a half-holiday , for I had come home from school rather early in the afternoon . Alexandre , dear old ruddy round-faced Alexandre , who opened the door for me , smiled in a way that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sir . ' Then my mother smiled too , a smile , I thought , of peculiar promise and interest . After I had kissed her she said , ' Come into the dining-room . There 's something you will like . ' Perhaps I concluded it would be something to eat . Anyhow , all agog with curiosity , I followed her into the dining -- room -- and Alexandre followed me , anxious to take part in the rejoicing . In the window stood a big cage , enclosing the family of white mice . I remember it as a very big cage indeed ; no doubt I should find it shrunken to quite moderate dimensions if I could see it again . There were three generations of mice in it : a fat old couple , the founders of the race , dozing phlegmatically on their laurels in a corner ; then a dozen medium-sized , slender mice , trim and youthful-looking , rushing irrelevantly hither and thither , with funny inquisitive little faces ; and then a squirming mass of pink things , like caterpillars , that were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , though . In a few days they had put on virile togas of white fur , and were scrambling about the cage and nibbling their food as independently as their elders . The rapidity with which my mice multiplied and grew to maturity was a constant source of astonishment to me . It seemed as if every morning I found a new litter of young mice in the cage -- though how they had effected an entrance through the wire gauze that lined it was a hopeless puzzle -- and these would have become responsible , self-supporting mice in no time . My mother told me that somebody had sent me this soul-stirring present from the country , and I dare say I was made to sit down and write a letter of thanks . But I 'm ashamed to own I ca n't remember who the giver was . I have a vague notion that it was a lady , an elderly **25;3207;TOOLONG ... something that began with P -- who lived near Tours , and who used to come to Paris once or twice a year , and always brought me a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set it up against the wall . I stationed myself in front of it , and remained there all the rest of the afternoon , gazing in , entranced . To watch their antics , their comings and goings , their labours and amusements , to study their shrewd , alert physiognomies , to wonder about their feelings , thoughts , intentions , to try to divine the meaning of their busy twittering language -- it was such keen , deep delight . Of course I was an anthropomorphist , and read a great deal of human nature into them ; otherwise it would n't have been such fun . I dragged myself reluctantly away when I was called to dinner . It was hard that evening to apply myself to my school-books . Before I went to bed I paid them a parting visit ; they were huddled together in their nest of cotton-wool , sleeping soundly . And I was up at an unheard-of hour next morning , to have a bout with them before going to school . I found Alexandre , in his nightcap and long white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He cleaned out the cage , put in fresh food and water , and then , pointing to the fat old couple , the grandparents , who stopped lazily a-bed , sitting up and rubbing their noses together , whilst their juniors scampered merrily about their affairs , ' Tiens ! On dirait Monsieur et Madame Denis , ' he cried . I felt the appositeness of his allusion ; and the old couple were forthwith officially denominated Monsieur and Madame Denis , for their resemblance to the hero and heroine of the song -- though which was Monsieur , and which Madame , I 'm not sure that I ever clearly knew . It was a little after this that I was taken for the first time in my life to the play . I fancy the theatre must have been the Porte St. Martin ; at any rate , it was a theatre in the Boulevard , and towards the East , for I remember the long drive we had to reach it And the piece was The Count of Monte Cristo . In my memory the adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and joy ; a child 's first visit to the play , and that play The Count of Monte Cristo ! It was all the breath-taking pleasantness of romance made visible , audible , actual . A vague blur of light and joy , from which only two details separate themselves . First , the prison scene , and an aged man , with a long white beard , moving a great stone from the wall ; then -- the figure of Mercedes . I went home terribly in love with Mercedes . Surely there are no such grandes passions in maturer life as those helpless , inarticulate ones we burn in secret with , before our teens ; surely we never love again so violently , desperately , consumedly . Anyhow , I went home terribly in love with Mercedes . And -- do all children lack humour ?  - -  I picked out the prettiest young ladyish-looking mouse in my collection , cut off her moustaches , adopted her as my especial pet , and called her by the name of my dea certe . All of my mice by this time had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a comfortable home , and not a care in the world ; and familiarity with their master had bred assurance ; and so they had become quite tame , and shamefully , abominably lazy . Luxury , we are taught , was ever the mother of sloth . I could put my hand in amongst them , and not one would bestir himself the littlest bit to escape me . Mercedes and I were inseparable . I used to take her to school with me every day ; she could be more conveniently and privately transported than a lamb . Each lyceen had a desk in front of his form , and she would spend the school-hours in mine , I leaving the lid raised a little , that she might have light and air . One day , the usher having left the room for a moment , I put her down on the floor , thereby creating a great excitement amongst my fellow-pupils , who got up from their places and formed an eager circle round her . Then suddenly the usher came back , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of Mercedes , cried out , ' A mouse ! A white mouse ! Who dares to bring a white mouse to the class ? ' And he made a dash for her . But she was too quick , too ' cute , for ' the likes of ' Monsieur le Pion . She gave a jump , and in the twinkling of an eye had disappeared up my leg , under my trousers . The usher searched high and low for her , but she prudently remained in her hiding-place ; and thus her life was saved , for , when he had abandoned his ineffectual chase , he announced , ' I should have wrung her neck . ' I turned pale to imagine the doom she had escaped as by a hair's-breadth . ' It is useless to ask which of you brought her here , ' he continued . ' But mark my words : if ever I find a mouse again in the class I will wring her neck ! ' And yet , in private life , this bloodthirsty pion was a quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling fellow , with literary aspirations , who would not have hurt a fly . The secrets of a schoolboy 's pocket ! I once saw a boy surreptitiously angling in Kensington Gardens , with a string and a bent pin . Presently he landed a fish , a fish no bigger than your thumb perhaps , but still a fish . Alive and wet and flopping as it was , he slipped it into his pocket . I used to carry Mercedes about in mine . One evening , when I put in my hand to take her out , I discovered to my bewilderment that she was not alone . There were four little pink mites of infant mice clinging to her . I had enjoyed my visit to the theatre so much that at the jour de l'an my father included a toy-theatre among my presents . It had a real curtain of green baize , that would roll up and down , and beautiful coloured scenery that you could shift , and footlights , and a trap-door in the middle of the stage ; and indeed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have since learned that this is not infrequently the case with theatres . My company consisted of pasteboard men and women who , as artists , struck me as eminently unsatisfactory . They could n't move their arms or legs , and they had such stolid , uninteresting faces . I do n't know how it first occurred to me to turn them all off , and fill their places with my mice . Mercedes , of course , was leading lady ; Monsieur and Madame Denis were the heavy parents ; and a gentlemanlike young mouse named Leander was jeune premier . Then , in my leisure , they used to act the most tremendous plays . I was stage-manager , prompter , playwright , chorus , and audience , placing the theatre before a looking-glass , so that , though my duties kept me behind , I could peer round the edge , and watch the spectacle as from the front . I would invent the lines and deliver them , but , that my illusion might be the more complete , I would change my voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses ; no doubt they were vers libres . At any rate , they were mouth-filling and sonorous . The first play we attempted , I need hardly say , was Le Comte de Monte Cristo , such version of it as I could reconstruct from memory . That had rather a long run . Then I dramatised Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp , Paul et Virginie , Quentin Durward , and La Dame de Monsoreau . Mercedes made a charming Diane , Leander a brilliant and dashing Bussy ; Monsieur Denis was cast for the role of Frere Gorenflot ; and a long , thin , cadaverous-looking mouse , Don Quichotte by name , somewhat inadequately represented Chicot . We began , as you see , with melodrama ; presently we descended to light comedy , playing Les Memoires d'un Ane , Jean qui rit , and other works of the immortal Madame de Segur . And then at last we turned a new leaf , and became naturalistic . We had never heard of the naturalist school , though Monsieur Zola had already published some volumes of the Rougon-Macquart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for ourselves , discovered the possibilities of naturalism simultaneously , as it were , with the acknowledged apostle of that form of art . We would impersonate the characters of our own world -- our schoolfellows and masters , our parents , servants , friends -- and carry them through experiences and situations derived from our impressions of real life . Perhaps we rather led them a dance ; and I daresay those we did n't like came in for a good deal of retributive justice . It was a little universe , of which we were the arch-arbiters , our will the final law . I do n't know whether all children lack humour ; but I 'm sure no grown-up author-manager can take his business more seriously than I took mine . Oh , I enjoyed it hugely ; the hours I spent at it were enraptured hours ; but it was grim , grim earnest . After a while I began to long for a less subjective public , a more various audience . I would summon the servants , range them in chairs at one end of the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fervid solemnity . And they would giggle , and make flippant commentaries , and at my most impassioned climaxes burst into guffaws . My mice , as has been said , were overfed and lazy , and I used to have to poke them through their parts with sticks from the wings ; but this was a detail which a superior imagination should have accepted as one of the conventions of the art . It made the servants laugh , however ; and when I would step to the front in person , and , with tears in my eyes , beseech them to be sober , they would but laugh the louder . ' Bless you , sir , they 're only mice -- ce ne sont que des souris , ' the cook called out on one such occasion . She meant it as an apology and a consolation , but it was the unkindest cut of all . Only mice , indeed ! To me they had been a young gentleman and lady lost in the Desert of Sahara , near to die for the want of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into slavery by a band of Bedouin Arabs . Ah , well , the artist must steel himself to meet with indifference or derision from the public , to be ignored , misunderstood , or jeered at ; and to rely for his real , his legitimate , reward on the pleasure he finds in his work . And now there befell a great change in my life . Our home in Paris was broken up , and we moved to St. Petersburg . It was impossible to take my mice with us ; their cage would have hopelessly complicated our impedimenta . So we gave them to the children of our concierge . Mercedes , however , I was resolved I would not part with , and I carried her all the way to the Russian capital by hand . In my heart I was looking to her to found another family -- she had so frequently become a mother in the past . But month succeeded month , and she for ever disappointed me , and at last I abandoned hope . In solitude and exile Mercedes degenerated sadly ; got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth grow to a preposterous length ; and in the end died of a surfeit of smetana . When I returned to Paris , at the age of twenty , to faire mon droit in the Latin Quarter , I paid a visit to our old house , and discovered the same old concierge in the loge . I asked her about the mice , and she told me her children had found the care of them such a bother that at first they had neglected them , and at last allowed them to escape . ' They took to the walls , and for a long time afterwards , Monsieur , the mice of this neighbourhood were pied . To this day they are of a paler hue than elsewhere . ' A BROKEN LOOKING-GLASS He climbed the three flights of stone stairs , and put his key into the lock ; but before he turned it , he stopped -- to rest , to take breath . On the door his name was painted in big white letters , Mr. Richard Dane . It is always silent in the Temple at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog . It was Sunday night ; and on Sunday night , even within the hushed precincts of the Temple , one is conscious of a deeper hush . When he had lighted the lamp in his sitting-room , he let himself drop into an armchair before the empty fireplace . He was tired , he was exhausted . Yet nothing had happened to tire him . He had dined , as he always dined on Sundays , with the Rodericks , in Cheyne Walk ; he had driven home in a hansom . There was no reason why he should be tired . But he was tired . A deadly lassitude penetrated his body and his spirit , like a fluid . He was too tired to go to bed . ' I suppose I am getting old , ' he thought . To a second person the matter would have appeared not one of supposition but of certainty , not of progression but of accomplishment . Getting old indeed ? But he was old . It was an old man , grey and wrinkled and wasted , who sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy-chair . In years , to be sure , he was under sixty ; but he looked like a man of seventy-five . ' I am getting old , I suppose I am getting old . ' And vaguely , dully , he contemplated his life , spread out behind him like a misty landscape , and thought what a failure it had been . What had it come to ? What had it brought him ? What had he done or won ? Nothing , nothing . It had brought him nothing but old age , solitude , disappointment , and , to-night especially , a sense of fatigue and apathy that weighed upon him like a suffocating blanket . On a table , a yard or two away , stood a decanter of whisky , with some soda-water bottles and tumblers ; he looked at it with heavy eyes , and he knew that there was what he needed . A little whisky would strengthen him , revive him , and make it possible for him to bestir himself and undress and go to bed . But when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shrank from that effort as from an Herculean labour ; no -- he was too tired . Then his mind went back to the friends he had left in Chelsea half an hour ago ; it seemed an indefinably long time ago , years and years ago ; they were like blurred phantoms , dimly remembered from a remote past . Yes , his life had been a failure ; total , miserable , abject . It had come to nothing ; its harvest was a harvest of ashes . If it had been a useful life , he could have accepted its unhappiness ; if it had been a happy life , he could have forgiven its uselessness ; but it had been both useless and unhappy . He had done nothing for others , he had won nothing for himself . Oh , but he had tried , he had tried . When he had left Oxford people expected great things of him ; he had expected great things of himself . He was admitted to be clever , to be gifted ; he was ambitious , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wished to justify his existence by fruitful work . And he had worked hard . He had put all his knowledge , all his talent , all his energy , into his work ; he had not spared himself ; he had passed laborious days and studious nights . And what remained to show for it ? Three or four volumes upon Political Economy , that had been read in their day a little , discussed a little , and then quite forgotten -- superseded by the books of newer men . ' Pulped , pulped , ' he reflected bitterly . Except for a stray dozen of copies scattered here and there -- in the British Museum , in his College library , on his own bookshelves -- his published writings had by this time ( he could not doubt ) met with the common fate of unappreciated literature , and been ' pulped . ' ' Pulped -- pulped ; pulped -- pulped . ' The hateful word beat rhythmically again and again in his tired brain ; and for a little while that was all he was conscious of . So much for the work of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The living ? Oh , he had nothing to recall but failure . It had sufficed that he should desire a thing , for him to miss it ; that he should set his heart upon a thing , for it to be removed beyond the sphere of his possible acquisition . It had been so from the beginning ; it had been so always . He sat motionless as a stone , and allowed his thoughts to drift listlessly hither and thither in the current of memory . Everywhere they encountered wreckage , derelicts ; defeated aspirations , broken hopes . Languidly he envisaged these . He was too tired to resent , to rebel . He even found a certain sluggish satisfaction in recognising with what unvarying harshness destiny had treated him , in resigning himself to the unmerited . He caught sight of his hand , lying flat and inert upon the brown leather arm of his chair . His eyes rested on it , and for the moment he forgot everything else in a sort of torpid study of it . How white it was , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute corrugations ; the veins stood out like dark wires ; the skin hung loosely on it , and had a dry lustre : an old man 's hand . He gazed at it fixedly , till his eyes closed and his head fell forward . But he was not sleepy , he was only tired and weak . He raised his head with a start and changed his position . He felt cold ; but to endure the cold was easier than to get up , and put something on , or go to bed . How silent the world was ; how empty his room . An immense feeling of solitude , of isolation , fell upon him . He was quite cut off from the rest of humanity here . If anything should happen to him , if he should need help of any sort , what could he do ? Call out ? But who would hear ? At nine in the morning the porter 's wife would come with his tea . But if anything should happen to him in the meantime ? There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , if he had married , if he had had children , a wife , a home of his own , instead of these desolate bachelor chambers ! If he had married , indeed ! It was his sorrow 's crown of sorrow that he had not married , that he had not been able to marry , that the girl he had wished to marry would n't have him . Failure ? Success ? He could have accounted failure in other things a trifle , he could have laughed at what the world calls failure , if Elinor Lynd had been his wife . But that was the heart of his misfortune , she would n't have him . He had met her for the first time when he was a lad of twenty , and she a girl of eighteen . He could see her palpable before him now : her slender girlish figure , her bright eyes , her laughing mouth , her warm brown hair curling round her forehead . Oh , how he had loved her . For twelve years he had waited upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had always said , ' No -- I do n't love you . I am very fond of you ; I love you as a friend ; we all love you that way -- my mother , my father , my sisters . But I ca n't marry you . ' However , she married no one else , she loved no one else : and for twelve years he was an ever-welcome guest in her father 's house ; and she would talk with him , play to him , pity him ; and he could hope . Then she died . He called one day , and they said she was ill . After that there came a blank in his memory -- a gulf , full of blackness and redness , anguish and confusion ; and then a sort of dreadful sudden calm , when they told him she was dead . He remembered standing in her room , after the funeral , with her father , her mother , her sister Elizabeth . He remembered the pale daylight that filled it , and how orderly and cold and forsaken it all looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died in ; and there her dressing-table , with her combs and brushes ; and there her writing-desk , her book-case . He remembered a row of medicine bottles on the mantelpiece ; he remembered the fierce anger , the hatred of them , as if they were animate , that had welled up in his heart as he looked at them , because they had failed to do their work . ' You will wish to have something that was hers , Richard , ' her mother said . ' What would you like ? ' On her dressing-table there was a small looking-glass , in an ivory frame . He asked if he might have that , and carried it away with him . She had looked into it a thousand times , no doubt ; she had done her hair in it ; it had reflected her , enclosed her , contained her . He could almost persuade himself that something of her must remain in it . To own it was like owning something of herself . He carried it home with him , hugging it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prized it , he prized it still , as his dearest treasure ; the looking-glass in which her face had been reflected a thousand times ; the glass that had contained her , known her ; in which something of herself , he felt , must linger . To handle it , look at it , into it , behind it , was like holding a mystic communion with her ; it gave him an emotion that was infinitely sweet and bitter , a pain that was dissolved in joy . The glass lay now , folded in its ivory case , on the chimney-shelf in front of him . That was its place ; he always kept it on his chimney-shelf , so that he could see it whenever he glanced round his room . He leaned back in his chair , and looked at it ; for a long time his eyes remained fixed upon it . ' If she had married me , she would n't have died . My love , my care , would have healed her . She could not have died . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again in his mind , while his eyes remained fixed on the ivory case into which her looking-glass was folded . It was an effect of his fatigue , no doubt , that his eyes , once directed upon an object , were slow to leave it for another ; that a phrase once pronounced in his thought had this tendency to repeat itself over and over again . But at last he roused himself a little , and leaning forward , put his hand out and up , to take the glass from the shelf . He wished to hold it , to touch it and look into it . As he lifted it towards him , it fell open , the mirror proper being fastened to a leather back , which was glued to the ivory , and formed a hinge . It fell open ; and his grasp had been insecure ; and the jerk as it opened was enough . It slipped from his fingers , and dropped with a crash upon the hearthstone . The sound went through him like a physical pain . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His heart was beating as after a mighty physical exertion . He knew vaguely that a calamity had befallen him ; he could vaguely imagine the splinters of shattered glass at his feet . But his physical prostration was so great as to obliterate , to neutralise , emotion . He felt very cold . He felt that he was being hurried along with terrible speed through darkness and cold air . There was the continuous roar of rapid motion in his ears , a faint , dizzy bewilderment in his head . He felt that he was trying to catch hold of things , to stop his progress , but his hands closed upon emptiness ; that he was trying to call out for help , but he could make no sound . On -- on -- on , he was being whirled through some immeasurable abyss of space . * * * * * ' Ah , yes , he 's dead , quite dead , ' the doctor said . ' He has been dead some hours . He must have passed away peacefully , sitting here in his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . ' And a broken looking-glass beside him . Oh , it 's a sure sign , a broken looking-glass . ' THE REWARD OF VIRTUE He was one of the institutions of the Latin Quarter , one of the least admirable . He haunted the Boulevard St. Michel , hung round the cafes , begged of the passing stranger , picked up cigarette-ends , and would , at a pinch , run errands , or do odd jobs . With his sallow , wrinkled skin , his jungle of grey beard , his thick grey hair , matted and shiny , covering his ears and falling about his shoulders , he was scarcely an attractive-looking person . Besides , he had lost an eye ; and its empty socket irresistibly drew your gaze -- an abhorrent vacuum . His clothes would be the odds and ends of students ' offcasts , in the last stages of disintegration . He had a chronic stoop ; always aimed his surviving eye obliquely at you , from a bent head ; and walked with a sort of hang-dog shuffle that seemed a general self-denunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pavement , and when , were among his secrets . No matter how late or how early you were abroad , you would be sure to encounter Bibi , wide-awake , somewhere in the Boul ' Miche , between the Luxembourg and the Rue des Ecoles . That was his beat . Perhaps one of the benches was his home . He lived in a state of approximate intoxication . I never drew near to him without getting a whiff of alcohol , yet I never saw him radically drunk . His absorbent capacity must have been tremendous . It is certain he spent all the sous he could collect for liquids ( he never wasted money upon food ; he knew where to go for crusts of bread and broken meat ; the back doors of restaurants have their pensioners ) , and if invited to drink as the guest of another , he would drain tumbler after tumbler continuously , until his entertainer stopped him , and would appear no further over-seas at the end than at the outset . There was something pathetic in his comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the institutions of the Quarter , one of the notabilities . It was a matter of pride ( I ca n't think why ) to be on terms of hail-fellowship with him , on terms to thee-and-thou him , and call him by his nick-name , Bibi , Bibi Ragout : a sobriquet that he had come by long before my time , and whose origin I never heard explained . It seemed sufficiently disrespectful , but he accepted it cheerfully , and would often , indeed , employ it in place of the personal pronoun in referring to himself . ' You 're not going to forget Bibi -- you 'll not forget poor old Bibi Ragout ? ' would be his greeting on the jour de l'an , for instance . I have said that he would run errands or do odd jobs . The business with which people charged him was not commonly of a nature to throw lustre upon either agent or principal . He would do a student 's dirty work , even an etudiante 's , in a part of Paris where work to be accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least ignominious service one used to require of him was to act as intermediary with the pawn-shop , the clou ; a service that he performed to the great satisfaction of his clients , for , what with unbounded impudence and a practice of many years , he knew ( as the French slang goes ) how to make the nail bleed . We trusted him with our valuables and our money though it was of record that he had once ' done time ' for theft . But his victim had been a bourgeois from across the river ; we were confident he would deal honourably by a fellow Quarternion -- he had the esprit de corps . It was Bibi in his social aspect , however , not in his professional , who especially interested us . It was very much the fashion to ask him to join the company at a cafe table , to offer him libations , and to ' draw ' him -- make him talk . He would talk of any subject : of art , literature , politics ; of life and morals ; of the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons , places , events ; he had outlasted many generations of students , and had hob-and-nobbed in their grub-period with men who had since become celebrities , as he was now hob-and-nobbing with us . He was quite shameless , quite without reverence for himself or others ; his conversation was apt to be highly-flavoured , scandalous , slanderous , and redundant with ambiguous jests ; yet -- what made it fascinating and tragical -- it was unmistakably the conversation of an educated man . His voice was soft , his accent cultivated , his sentences were nicely chiselled . He knew the mot juste , the happy figure , the pat allusion . His touch was light ; his address could be almost courtly , so that , on suddenly looking up , you would feel a vague surprise to behold in the speaker , not a polished man of the world in his dress-suit , but this beery old one-eyed vagabond in tatters . It was strange to witness his transitions . At one moment he would be holding high discourse of Goethe , and translating illustrative passages into classic French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begging for a petite salete de vingt sous , in the cant of the Paris gutters . Or , from an analysis of the character of some conspicuous personage he had known , he would break into an indecent song , or pass to an interchange of mildewed chaff with Gigolette . Yes , he was a gentleman . This disreputable old man , whose grey hairs , far from making him venerable , but emphasised his sodden degradation ; this tipsy , filthy , obscene old man ; this gaol-bird , this doer of dirty work , this pandar , beggar , outcast , who bore without offence such a title of contempt as Bibi Ragout , was a fallen gentleman , the wreck of something that had once been noble . More than the fragmentary outline of his history we did not know . We knew that he was a Russian ; that his name was Kasghine ; that he had started in life as an officer in the Russian army ; that many years ago , for crimes conjectural , he had fled his country ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we found him , the mud of the Boulevard St. Michel . For crimes conjectural . Some of us believed them to have been political , and fancied that we had in Bibi a specimen of the decayed Nihilist . In view of the fact that he often proclaimed himself a socialist , this seemed to bear some colour of probability ; but against it argued the circumstance that of the members of that little clan of Russian refugees which inhabits the southern borderland of the Latin Quarter , not one would have aught to say to Bibi . They gave him the widest of wide berths , and when questioned as to their motives , would only shrug their shoulders , and answer that he was a disgraceful old person , a drunken reprobate , whom , the wonder was not that they avoided , but that any decent people could tolerate . This sounded plausible ; still we felt that if his crimes had been political , they might have regarded him with more indulgence . Of Bibi himself it was equally futile to inquire . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , before he came to be what we saw . ' Yes , I am a gentleman . I am Captain Kasghine . I am a gentleman in allotropic form ' ; that was as much as I ever heard him say . He enjoyed cloaking himself in mystery , he enjoyed the curiosity it drew upon him ; but perhaps he had some remnants of pride , some embers of remorse , some little pain and shame , as well . Of the other legends afloat , one ran to the effect that he had murdered his wife ; a second , that he had poisoned the husband of a lady friend ; a third , that he had shown the white feather in battle ; a fourth , that he had cheated at cards . Bibi would neither admit nor deny any of these imputations , nor would he manifest the faintest resentment when they were discussed in his presence . He would parry them , smiling complaisantly : and ( if it be considered that they were all , as it turned out , abominably false ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abysmal depths the man had sunk . Perhaps it shows also , incidentally , how very heartless and unimaginative young people in the Latin Quarter used to be . I have seen Bibi swagger ; I have seen him sullen , insolent , sarcastic ; I have seen him angry , I have heard him swear ; but anything like honestly indignant I never saw him . I remember one night in the Cafe de la Source , when Fil de Fer had been treating him to brandy and trying to get him to tell his story ; I remember his suddenly turning his one eye in the direction of us men , and launching himself upon a long flight of rhetoric . I can see him still -- his unwashed red hand toying with the stem of his liqueur-glass , or rising from time to time to push his hair from his forehead , over which it dangled in soggy wisps , while , in a dinner-table tone of voice , he uttered these somewhat surprising sentiments . ' You would be horrified , you others , lads of twenty , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thought it possible that you might end your days like Bibi , would you not ? You wish to walk a clean path , to prosper , to be respectable , to wear sweet linen , to die honoured , regretted . And yet , believe me , we poor devils who fail , who fall , who sink to the bottom , we have our compensation . We see vastly more of the realities of life than those do who succeed and rise to the top . We have an experience that is more essential , more significant . We get the real flavour of life . We sweat in the mire ; we drink the lees . But the truth is in the mire ; the real flavour is in the lees . Oh , we have our compensation . We wear rags , we eat scraps fit for dogs , we sleep under the arches of bridges . We lie in gaols , we are hustled by the police , we are despised by all men . If you offer us drink , and stop to gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please yourselves with the spectacle of our infamy , our infirmity , our incongruity . We have lost all hope , all self-respect . We are ships that have come to grief , that are foundering , that will presently go down . Yet we are not altogether to be pitied : we know life . To the respectable man , the prosperous , life shows herself only in the world , decently attired : we know her at home in her nudity . For him she has manners , a good behaviour , a society smile ; with us she is frankly herself -- brutal , if you please , corrupt with disease and vice , sordid , profane , lascivious , but genuine . She is kind to him , but hypocritical , affecting scruples , modesties , pieties , a heart and conscience , attitudinising , blushing false blushes , weeping crocodile tears ; she is cruel to us , but sincere . She is at her ease with us -- unashamed . She shows us her thousand moods . She does n't trouble to keep her secrets from us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boot that constrained her cloven hoof . She gives free play to her appetites . We know her . ' Here is the fruit of the tree of life , ' he went on , extending his open hand . ' The respectable man but smells its rind ; I eat deep , taste the core . The smell is sweet , perhaps ; the taste is deathly bitter . But even so ? He that eats of the fruit of the tree of life shares the vision of the gods . He gazes upon the naked face of truth . I do n't pretend that the face of truth is beautiful . It is hideous beyond imagination . All hate , all savagery , all evil , glare from it , and all uncleanness is upon it . But it is the face of truth ; the sight of it gives an ultimate , a supreme satisfaction . ' Say what you will , at the end of life the important thing is to have lived . Well , when all is over , and the prosperous man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes , conditions , outlooks at last for once the same , our results the same , I shall have lived , I shall have seen , I shall have understood , a thousandfold more than he . I shall have known life in her intimacy ; he will have had but a polite acquaintance with her . ' The hour for Bibi to put this philosophy to the test was nearer than he suspected . He used to describe himself as ' thoroughly cured and seasoned , ' and to predict that he would ' last a good while yet . ' But , one day in December , a subject of remark in the Boul ' Miche was Bibi 's absence ; and before nightfall the news went abroad that he had been found on the turf , under a tree , in the Avenue de l'Observatoire , dead from a coup de sang , and that he was now lying exposed to the gaze of the curious in the little brick house behind Notre Dame . A meeting of students was called , at which it was resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his friends who had crossed the river might have an opportunity of assisting at it , a lettre de faire part was published in the newspapers . The Committee who had these matters in charge made an attempt to get a Pope from the Russian Church to officiate ; but the holy men were scandalised by the request , and refused it with contumely . So a civil funeral was the best that could be achieved . On a drizzling , dismal December morning , then , we formed ourselves in a procession of two abreast , and starting from the Place St. Michel , followed Bibi up his familiar Boulevard to the Cemetery of Montparnasse ; and men who would have spurned him yesterday , bared their heads as he passed , and women crossed themselves and muttered prayers . We must have been about a hundred strong , and quite a quarter of our numbers came from beyond the bridges , responsive to our lettre de faire part . A student was told off to march with each visitor ; and this arrangement proved the means of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . The person to whom I found myself assigned was an elderly , military-looking man , with the red rosette in his buttonhole ; extremely well-dressed and groomed ; erect , ruddy , bright-eyed ; with close-cropped white hair , and a drooping white moustache : the picture of a distinguished , contented , fine old French gentleman : whom I marvelled a good deal to see in this conjunction . On our way to the graveyard we spoke but little . Our business there over , however , he offered me a seat in his carriage , a brougham that had sauntered after us , for the return . And no sooner was the carriage door closed upon us than he began --  ' I am an old man . I want to talk . Will you listen ? ' This death , this funeral , have stirred me deeply . I knew Kasghine years ago in Russia , when we were both young men , he an officer in the Russian army , I an attache to the French Embassy . ' His career has been a very sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trite to say so -- an act of baseness , a crime of some sort , may be the beginning , the first cause , of a man 's salvation . It pulls him up , wakes his conscience . Aghast at what he has done , he reflects , repents , reforms . That is a comforting circumstance , a token of God 's goodness . ' But what shall we say when the exact opposite happens ? When it is an act of nobility , of splendid heroism , of magnificent self-devotion , that brings to pass a man 's moral downfall ? It is horrible to admit such a thing as possible , is it not ? And yet , the same man who may be capable of one sudden immense act of heroism , may be quite incapable of keeping up the prolonged , daily , yearly struggle with adversity which that act may entail upon him . ' It was so with Kasghine . It was a very noble action which drove him , an exile , from his country . Thrown upon the streets of Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff in him to stand up against the forces that were in operation to drag him down . Which of us can be sure that he would have that stuff ? From begging for work whereby to earn money , Kasghine fell to begging for money itself . His pride receiving a thousand wounds , instead of being strengthened by them , was killed . Cleanliness is a luxury , a labour ; he began to neglect his person ; and , in the case of a gentleman , neglect of the person is generally the first step towards neglect of the spirit . Little by little he lost his civilised character , and reverted to the primitive beast . He was feral . ' But thirty , thirty-five years ago , there were few young men in St. Petersburg with better positions , brighter prospects , than Kasghine 's . He belonged to an excellent family ; he was intelligent , good-looking , popular ; he was a Captain in a good regiment . One of his uncles had been minister of war , and stood high in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1847 , Kasghine 's regiment was ordered to Warsaw , and garrisoned in the fortress there . Twenty Polish patriots were confined in the casemates , awaiting execution ; men of education , honourable men , men with wives and children , condemned to be hanged because they had conspired together -- a foolish , ineffectual conspiracy -- against what they regarded as the tyranny of Russia , for the liberty of their country . They had struck no blow , but they had written and talked ; and they were to be hanged . ' The fate of these men seemed to Kasghine very unjust , very inhuman . It preyed upon his mind . He took it into his head to rescue them , to contrive their escape . I do not say that this was wise or right ; but it was certainly generous . No doubt he had a period of hesitation . On the one hand was his consigne as a Russian soldier ; on the other , what he conceived to be his duty as a man . He knew that the act he contemplated spelt ruin for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to hold life sweet . ' However , he opened communications with the prisoners in the casemates , and with their friends in the town . And one night he got them all safely out ,  - -  by daybreak they were secure in hiding . Kasghine himself remained behind . Some one would have to be punished . If the guilty man fled , an innocent man would be punished . ' Well , he was tried by Court Martial , and sentenced to be shot . But the Emperor , out of consideration for Kasghine 's family , commuted the sentence to one of hard labour for life in the mines of Kara ,  - -  a cruel kindness . After eight years in the mines , with blunted faculties , broken health , disfigured by the loss of an eye , and already no doubt in some measure demoralised by the hardships he had suffered , he was pardoned ,  - -  another cruel kindness . He was pardoned on condition that he would leave Russian territory , and never enter it again . There are periodic wholesale pardonings , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fresh convicts . ' Kasghine 's private fortune had been confiscated . His family had ceased all relations with him , and would do nothing for him . He came to Paris , and had to engage in the struggle for existence , a struggle with which he was totally unfamiliar , for which he was totally unequipped . The only profession he knew was soldiering . He tried to obtain a commission in the French army . International considerations , if no others , put that out of the question . He tried to get work ,  - -  teaching , translating . He was not a good teacher ; his translations did not please his employers . Remember , his health was enfeebled , he was disfigured by the loss of an eye ; he had spent eight years in the mines at Kara . He began to sink . Let those blame him who know how hard it is to swim . From borrowing , from begging , he sank to I dare not guess what . I am afraid there can be no doubt that for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he proved an unremunerative spy ; they turned him off . He took to drink , he sank lower and lower , he became whatever is lowest . I had not seen him or heard of him for years , when , yesterday , I read the announcement of his death in the Figaro . ' The old man set me down at the corner of the Rue Racine . I have never met him again ; I have never learned who he was . The other day , being in Paris , I made a pilgrimage to the Cemetery of Montparnasse , to look at Bibi 's grave . The wooden cross we had erected over it was pied with weather-stains , the inscription more than half obliterated --  ALEXIS DIMITRIEVITCH KASGHINE Ne a MOSCOU , le 20 JANVIER , 1823 , MORT a PARIS , le 20 DECEMBRE , 1884 . Priez pour lui . A RE-INCARNATION We were , according to our nightly habit , in possession of the Cafe des Souris -- dear Cafe des Souris , that is no more ; and our assiduous patronage rumour alleges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cafe des Souris , a score or so of us , chiefly English speakers , and all votaries of one or other of the ' quatre-z-arts , ' when the door swung open , and he entered . Now , the entrance of anybody not a member of our particular cenacle into the Cafe des Souris , we , who felt ( I do n't know why ) that we had proprietary rights in the establishment , could not help deeming somewhat in the nature of an unwarranted intrusion ; so we stopped our talk for an instant , and stared at him : a man of medium stature , heavily built , with hair that fell to his shoulders , escaping from beneath a broad-brimmed , soft felt hat , knee breeches like a bicyclist 's , and , in lieu of overcoat , a sort of doublet , or magnified cape , of buff-coloured cloth . He supported our examination , and the accompanying interval of silence , which ordinary flesh and blood might have found embarassing , with more than composure -- with , it seemed to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated himself at the only vacant table . This world held nothing human worthy to rivet our attention longer than thirty seconds , whence , very soon , we were hot in debate again . It was the first Sunday in May ; I need hardly add that our subject-matter was the Vernissage , at which the greater number of us had assisted . For myself , however , I could not forbid my gaze to wander back from time to time upon the stranger : an indulgence touching which I felt the less compunction , in that he had ( it was a fair inference ) got himself up with a deliberate view to attracting just such notice . Else why the sombrero and knickerbockers , the flowing locks and eccentric yellow cloak ? Nay , I think it may have been in part this very note of undisguised vanity in the man that made it difficult to keep one 's eyes off him : it tickled the sense of humour , and challenged the curiosity . What would his state of mind be , who , in the dotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to cultivate a fragmentary resemblance to -- say a spurious Vandyke ? As the heat of the room began to tell upon him , he threw aside his outer garment , and hung up his hat , thereby discovering a velvet jacket and a very low-cut shirt , with unstarched rolling collar , and sailor 's knot of pale green Liberty silk . His long hair , of a faded , dusty brown , was brushed straight back from his forehead , and plastered down upon his scalp , in such wise as to lend him a misleading effect of baldness . He wore a drooping brown moustache , and a lustreless brown beard , trimmed to an Elizabethan point . His skin was sallow ; his eyes were big , wide apart , of an untransparent buttony brilliancy , and in colour dully blue . Taken for all in all , his face , deprived of the adventitious aids of long hair and Elizabethan beard , would have been peculiarly spiritless and insignificant , but from the complacency that shone like an unguent in every line of it , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was manifest that he posed as a unique and interesting character , a being mysterious and romantic , melancholy and rarely gifted -- like the artist in a bad play . Artist , indeed , of some description , I told myself , he must infallibly be reckoned . What mere professional man or merchant would have the heart to render his person thus conspicuous ? And the hypothesis that might have disposed of him as a model was excluded by the freshness of his clothes . A poet , painter , sculptor , possibly an actor or musician -- anyhow , something to which the generic name of artist , soiled with all ignoble use , could more or less flatteringly be applied -- I made sure he was ; an ornament of our own English-speaking race , moreover , proclaimed such by the light of intelligence that played upon his features as he followed our noisy conversation ; and , at a guess , two or three-and-thirty years of age . ' Anybody know the duffer with the hair ? ' This question , started by Charles K. Smith , of Battle Creek , Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his sobriquet of Chalks , went our rounds in an undertone ; and everybody answered , ' No . ' ' What is it ? Can it talk ? ' Pears like it can hear and catch on , ' was Chalks 's next remark . ' Shall we work the growler on it ? ' The process termed by Chalks ' working the growler ' was of ancient institution in the Cafe des Souris ; and I believe it is not unknown in other seats of learning -- a custom handed down from generation to generation of students , which , like politeness , costing little , yields generous returns . Should a casual wayfarer , happening amongst us , so far transgress the usages of good society as to volunteer a contribution to our talk , without the preliminary of an introduction , it was the rule instantly to require him to offer the company refreshments ; and , I am sorry to have to add , not infrequently , being thirsty , and possessing a lively appreciation of the value of our own money , we would , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glances of sympathetic understanding , or what not , designedly encourage such an one to address us , and so render himself liable to our impost . ' If we do n't , ' continued Chalks , ' it will be to fly in the face of Providence . The man is simply bursting to fire his mouth off . He 's had something to say swelling in him for the last half-hour . It will be an act of Christian mercy to let him say it . And for myself , I confess I 'm rather dry . ' Chalks doubtless argued from the eager eye with which the man regarded us ; from the uneasy way in which he held his seat , shifting in it , and edging in our direction ; and from the tentative manner in which he occasionally coughed . Now , persuaded by the American , we one by one fell silent , to give our victim his opportunity ; whilst those nearest to him baited the trap by looking enquiringly at his face . It was all he needed . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptom of diffidence , ' but I too was at the Vernissage to-day , and some of your comments upon it have surprised me . ' He spoke with a staccato north-country accent , in a chirpy , querulous little voice ; and each syllable seemed to chop the air , like a blow from a small hatchet . ' Am I to take it that you are serious when you condemn Bouguereau 's great picture as a croute ? Croute , if I mistake not , is equivalent to the English daub ? ' Our one-armed waiter , Pierre , had but awaited this crisis to come forward and receive our orders . When they were delivered Chalks courteously explained the situation to the neophyte , adding that , as a further formality , he must make us acquainted with his name and occupation . He accepted it in perfectly good part . ' I 'm sure I shall feel honoured if you will drink with me , ' he said , and settled the reckoning with Pierre . ' Name ? Name ? ' a dozen of us cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among so many Englishmen and Americans , some one would have recognised me , ' he replied . ' I am Davis Blake . ' He said it as one might say , ' I am Mr. Gladstone ' or Lord Salisbury -- or Bismarck -- with dignity , with an inflection of conscious greatness , it is true , but with neither haughtiness nor ostentation . We , however , are singularly ignorant of contemporary English literature in the Latin Quarter -- our chief reading matter , indeed , being Maupassant and Le Petit Journal pour Rire -- and though , as we shortly learned , here was a writer whose works were for sale at every bookstall in the United Kingdom , lavishly pirated in the United States , and distributed far and wide by Baron Tauchnitz on the Continent , his announcement left us unenlightened . ' Painter ? ' demanded Chalks . A shadow crossed his face . ' You are surely familiar with my name ? ' ' Never heard it that I know of , ' answered Chalks ; then , raising his voice , ' Any gentleman present ever heard of -- what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aside ; and being informed , went on , ' of Mr. Davis Blake ? ' No one spoke . ' Mud ? ' queried Chalks . ' Mud ? ' repeated Mr. Blake , perplexed . ' He means to enquire whether you are a sculptor , ' ventured I. ' A sculptor -- certainly not . ' He spoke sharply , throwing back his head . ' It is impossible that no one here should have heard of me ; and this pretence of ignorance is meant as a practical joke . I am a novelist -- one of the best known novelists living . I am Davis Blake , the author of " Crispin Dorr , " and " The Card Dealer . " My portrait , with a short biographical sketch , appeared in the Illustrated Gazette not a month ago . My works have been translated into French , German , Russian , and Italian . Of " The Card Dealer , " upwards of thirty thousand copies have been sold in Great Britain alone . ' ' Ah , then you could well afford to stand us drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't much on book-learning , this side the river , Mr. Blake . We 're plain blunt men , that ai n't ashamed of manual labour -- horny-handed sons of toil , in short . But we 're proud to meet a cultivated gentleman like yourself , all the same , and can appreciate him when met . ' Blake laughed rather lamely , and responded , ' I perceive that you are a humorist . Your countrymen are great admirers of my writings ; of " Crispin Dorr , " I am told , there are no fewer than three rival editions in the market ; and I have received complimentary letters and requests for my autograph , from all parts of the United States , I think that the quality of American humour has been over-rated : but I can forgive a jest at my own expense , provided it be not meant in malice . ' ' Every novice in our order , sir , ' said Chalks , ' must approve his mettle by undergoing something in the nature of an initiatory ordeal . We may now drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asking our opinion of Willy 's daub --  --  ' ' Willy ? ' questioned Blake . ' Ay -- Bouguereau . Is n't his front name William ? ' And Chalks , speaking as it were ex cathedra , made very short work indeed of Monsieur Bouguereau 's claims to rank as a painter . Blake listened with open-eyed wonder . But we are difficult critics , we of the Paris art schools , between the ages of twenty and twenty-five ; cold , cynical , suspicious as any Old Bailey judge ; and rare is the man whose work can sustain our notice , and get off with lighter censure than ' croute ' or ' plat d'epinards . ' We grow more lenient , however , as we advance in years . Already , at thirty , we begin to detect signs of promise in other canvases than our own . At forty , conceivably , we shall even admit a certain degree of actual merit . By and by , Chalks having concluded his pronouncement , and drifted to another corner of the room , Blake and I fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exceptional good fortune , ' he informed me , ' to have made the acquaintance of your little coterie this evening . I am on the point of writing a novel , in which it will be necessary that my hero should pass several years as a student in the Latin Quarter ; and I have run over from London for the especial purpose of collecting local colour . No doubt you will be able to help me with a hint or two as to the best mode of setting about it . ' ' I can think of none better than to come here and live for a while , ' said I. ' I only arrived last night , and I put up at the Grand Hotel . But it was quite my intention to move across the river directly I could find suitable lodgings . Do you know of any that you could recommend ? ' ' If you want to see student life par excellence , you can scarcely improve upon the shop I 'm in myself -- the Hotel du Saint-Esprit , in the Rue St. Jacques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail touching that house of entertainment , ' Yes , ' he said , ' then , if you will bespeak a room for me there , I 'll come to-morrow and stop for a week or ten days . ' ' A week or ten days ? ' I questioned . ' I ca n't spare more than a fortnight . I must be back in town by the 20th . ' ' But what can you hope to learn of Latin Quarter customs in a fortnight ? One ought to live here for a year , at the very least , before attempting to write us up . ' ' Ah , ' he rejoined , shaking his head and gazing dreamily at something invisible beyond the smoky atmosphere of the cafe , ' a man with dramatic insight can learn as much in a fortnight as an ordinary person in half a lifetime . Intuition and inspiration take the place of the note-book and the yard-stick . The author of The Merchant of Venice had never visited Italy . In " Crispin Dorr " I have described a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my longest voyage has been from Holyhead to Kingstown . Besides , ' he added , with a bow and smile , ' for the Latin Quarter , if you will take me under your protection , I shall , I am sure , benefit by the services of a capital cicerone . ' And the next afternoon he arrived . I met him at the threshold of the hotel , introduced him to our landlady , Madame Pamparagoux ( who stared rather wildly , not being accustomed to see her lodgers so mediaevally attired ) , and showed him upstairs to the room I had engaged . There he invited me to be seated while he unpacked his portmanteau and put his things in order . These , I noticed , were un-Britishly few and simple . I could discern no vestiges of either sponge or tub . As he moved backwards and forwards between his chest of drawers and dressing-table , he would cast frequent affectionate glances at his double , now in the glass of the armoire , now in that above the chimney . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion . ' I am a self-educated man . My father was a wine merchant in Leeds . At sixteen he put me to serve in the shop of a cousin , a print-seller . It was there , I think , that my literary instincts awoke . I contributed occasional art notes to a local paper . At twenty I came up to London and began my definite career , as a reporter . I was soon earning thirty shillings a week , which seemed to me magnificent . But I aspired to higher things . I felt within me the stirrings of what I could not help believing to be genius -- true genius . I longed to distinguish myself , to emerge from the crowd , from the background , to make myself remarked , to do something , to be somebody , to see my name a famous one . I was fortunate enough at this epoch to attract the notice of X --  --  , the poet . He believed in me , and encouraged me to believe in myself . It is one of the regrets of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I have achieved it . My name is a household word wherever the English language is read . I have written the only novels of my time that are sure to live . They will live not only by virtue of their style and matter , but because of a quality they possess which I must call universal -- a quality which appeals with equal force to readers of every rank , and which will procure for them as wide a popularity five hundred years hence as they enjoy to-day . I call them novels , but they are really prose-poems . The novel , ' he continued , rising for an instant to impersonal heights , ' the novel is the literary form or expression of my period , as the drama was that of Shakespeare 's , the epic of Homer 's . Do you follow me ? Ah , here is a copy of " Crispin Dorr "  - -  here is " The Card Dealer . " Take them and read them , and return them when you have finished . Being author 's copies , they possess an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a photograph of my wife . She is a good woman , but has no great literary culture , and we are not so happy together as I could wish . Men of commanding parts seldom make good husbands , and I committed the imprudence of marrying very young . My wife , you see , belongs to that class of society from which I have risen . I am the son of a wine merchant , yet I dine with peers , and have been favoured with smiles from peeresses . My wife has not kept pace with me . This is my little girl -- our only child -- my daughter Judith . Here is the Illustrated Gazette with the portrait of myself . ' Some of us in the Latin Quarter found the man 's egotism insupportable , and gave him a wide berth . Others , more numerous , among them the irrepressible Chalks , made it an object of derision , and would exhaust their ingenuity in efforts to lead him on , and entice him into more and more egregious exhibitions of it ; while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took , at least , no slightest pains to conceal their jubilant interchange of winks and nudges . ' If he were only an ass , ' Chalks urged , ' one might feel disposed to spare him . A merciful man is merciful to a beast . But he 's such a cad , to boot -- bandying his wife 's name about the Latin Quarter , telling Tom , Dick , and Harry of their conjugal differences , and boasting of his successes with other women ! ' A few of us , however , could not prevent an element of pity from tincturing our amusement . If his self-conceit was comical , by reason of its candour , it was surely pitiable , because of the poor , dwarfed starveling of a soul that it revealed . Here was a man , with life in his veins , and round about him the whole mystery and richness of creation -- and he could seriously think of nothing save how , by his dress , by his speech , his postures , to render himself the observed of all observers ! Wherever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sole thing he cared for -- to be the centre of attention , to be looked at , listened to , recognised and admired as a celebrity . And if the event happened otherwise , if he had ground for the suspicion that the people near him were suffering their minds to wander to another topic , his face would darken , his attitude become distinctly one of rancour . With Chalks , familiarity bred boldness ; he made the latter days of Blake 's sojourn amongst us exceedingly unhappy . ' Now , Mr. Blake , ' he would say , ' we are going to talk of art and love and things in general for a while , to rest our brains from the author of " Crispin Dorr . " Please step into the corner there and sulk . ' And he had a bit of slang , which he set to a bar of music , and would sing , as if in absence of mind , whenever the conversation lapsed , to the infinite annoyance of Mr. Blake :  --  ' Git your hair cut -- git your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is meant for me , ' Blake once protested , ' I take it as discourteous in the last degree . ' ' My dear sir , you were twenty thousand leagues from my thoughts . And as for getting your hair cut , I beseech you , do n't . You would shear away the fabric of our joy , ' Chalks answered . Blake had a curiously exaggerated notion of his fame ; and his jealousy thereof surpassed the jealousy of women . He took it for granted that everybody had heard of him , and bridled , as at a personal affront , when he met any one who had n't . If you fell into chance talk with him , in ignorance of his identity , he could not let three minutes pass without informing you . And then , if you appeared not adequately impressed , he would wax ill-tempered . He was genuinely convinced that his person and his actions were affairs of consuming interest to all the world . To be something , to do something , perhaps he honestly aspired ; but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , at his suggestion , we went together to the studio of Z --  --  , and I introduced him to the Master . But , as we moved about the vast room , among those small , priceless canvases , the consciousness grew upon me that my companion was in some distress of mind . His eye wandered ; his utterances were brief and dry . At length he got me into a corner , and remarked , ' You introduced me simply as Mr. Blake . He evidently does n't realise who I am . ' ' Oh , these Frenchmen are so indifferent to things not French , you know , ' said I. ' Yes -- but -- still -- I wish you could make an occasion to let him know . In introducing me you might have added " a distinguished English author . " ' ' But do you quite realise who he is ? ' I cried . ' He 's jolly near the most distinguished living painter . ' ' Never mind . He is treating me now as he might Brown , Jones , or Robinson . ' As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demand a difference . Nevertheless , I seized an opportunity to whisper in the Master 's ear a word or two to the desired effect . ' Tiens ! ' he returned composedly , and continued to treat his visitor precisely as he had done from the beginning . Blake had announced that he wanted to gather information about the Latin Quarter ; and I do n't doubt that his purpose was sincere , but he employed a novel method of attaining it . We took him everywhere , we showed him everything ; I could never observe that he either looked or listened . He would sit ( or stand or walk ) , his eye craving admiration from our faces ; his tongue wagging about himself ; his early hardships , his first success , his habits of work , his troubles with his wife , his liaison with Lady Blank , his tastes in fruits and wines , his handwriting , his very teeth and boots . He passed his life in a sort of trance , an ecstacy of self-absorption ; he had fallen in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narcissus . This idiosyncrasy was the means of defeating various conspiracies , in which Chalks , of course , was the prime mover , calculated to impose upon his credulity , and send him back to London loaded down with misinformation . ' His cheek , by Christopher ! ' cried Chalks . ' Live in the Quarter for a fortnight , keep his eyes and ears shut , talk perpetually of Davis Blake , and read nothing but his own works , and then go home and write a book about it . I 'll quarter him ! ' But Chalks counted without his man . That Monsieur Bullier , the founder of the Closerie des Lilas , was also Professor of Moral Philosophy in the College de France ; that the word etudiante ( for Blake had only a tourist 's smattering of French ) should literally be translated student , and that the young ladies who bore it as a name were indeed pursuing rigorous courses of study at the Sorbonne ; that it was obligatory upon a freshman ( nouveau ) in the Quarter to shave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his matriculation -- from these and kindred superstitions Blake was saved by his grand talent for never paying attention . In the meanwhile some of us had read his books : chromo-lithographs , struck in the primary colours ; pasteboard complications of passion and adventure , with the conservative entanglement of threadbare marionnettes -- a hero , tall , with golden brown moustaches and blue eyes ; a heroine , lissome , with ' sunny locks ; ' then a swarthy villain , for the most part a nobleman , and his Spanish-looking female accomplice , who had an uncomfortable habit of delivering her remarks ' from between clenched teeth , ' and , generally , ' in a blood-chilling hiss '  - -  the narrative set forth in a sustained fortissimo , and punctuated by the timely exits of the god from the machine . Never a felicity , never an impression . I fancy he had made his notes of human nature whilst observing the personages of a melodrama at a provincial theatre . He loved the obvious sentiment , the obvious and but approximate word . But the climax of his infatuation was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in session at the Cafe des Souris , and the talk had turned upon metempsychosis . Blake , for a wonder , pricked up his ears and appeared to listen , at the same time watching his chance to take the floor . Half-a-dozen men had their say first , however ; then he cut in . ' Metempsychosis is not a theory , it is a fact . I can testify to it from my personal experience . I know it . I can distinctly recall my former life . I can tell you who I was , who my friends were , what I did , what I felt , everything , down to the very dishes I preferred for dinner . ' Chalks scanned Blake 's features for an instant with an intentness that suggested a mingling of perplexity and malice ; then , all at once , I saw a light flash in his eyes , which forthwith began to twinkle in a manner that struck me as ominous . ' In my early youth , ' Blake continued , ' this memory of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasional . Feeling that I was no ordinary man , conscious of strange forces struggling in me , I would obtain , as it were , glimpses , fleeting and unsatisfactory , into a former state . Then they would go , not for long intervals to return . As time elapsed , however , these glimpses , to call them so , became more frequent and lasting , the intervals of oblivion shorter ; and at last , one day on Hampstead Heath , I identified myself in a sudden burst of insight . I was walking on the Heath , and thinking of my work -- marvelling at a certain quality I had discerned in it , which , I was convinced , would assure it everlasting life : a quality that seemed not unfamiliar to me , and yet which I could associate with none of the writers whose names passed in review before my mind ; not with Byron , or Shelley , or Keats , not with Wordsworth or Coleridge , Goethe or Dante , not even with Homer . I mean the quality which I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By-and-bye , I took out a little pocket mirror that I always carry , and looked into it , studying my face . One glance sufficed . There , suddenly , on Hampstead Heath , the whole thing flashed upon me . I saw , I understood ; I realised who I was , I remembered everything . ' ' Stop right there , Mr. Blake , ' called out Chalks in stentorian tones . ' Do n't you say another word . I 'm going to hail you by your right name in half-a-minute . I guess I must have recognised you the very first time I clapped eyes on your distinguished physiognomy ; only I could n't just place you , as we say over in America . But there was a je ne sais quoi in the whole cut of your jib as familiar to me as rolls and coffee . I tried and tried to think when and where I 'd had the pleasure before . But now that you speak of a former state of existence -- why , I 'm there ! It was all I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my memory . Talk about entertaining angels unawares ! The beard , eh ? And the yaller cloak ? And ai n't there a statue of you up Boulevard Haussmann way ? Shakesy , old man , shake ! ' And Chalks got hold of his victim 's hand and wrung it fervently . ' I 'm particularly glad to meet you this way , ' he added , ' because I was Queen Elizabeth myself ; and I ca n't begin to tell you how sort of out of it I felt , alone here with all this degenerate posterity . ' Blake coldly withdrew his hand , frowning loftily at Chalks . ' You should reserve your nonsense for more appropriate occasions , ' he said . ' Though you speak in a spirit of foolish levity , you have builded better than you knew . I am indeed Shakespeare re-incarnated . My books alone would prove it ; they could have been dictated by no other mind . But -- look at this . ' He produced from an interior pocket a case of red morocco and handed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flattering emphasis upon the pronoun , ' you are a man who can treat a serious matter seriously . What do you think of that ? ' The case contained a photograph , and the photograph represented the head and shoulders of Mr. Blake and a bust of Shakespeare , placed cheek by jowl . In the pointed beard and the wide-set eyes there were , perhaps , the rudiments of something remotely like a likeness . ' Is n't that conclusive ? ' he demanded . ' Does n't that place the fact beyond the reach of question ? ' ' You 've got more hair than you used to have , ' said Chalks . ' I 'm talking of the front hair -- your forehead ai n't as high as it was . But your back hair is all right enough . ' ' You have put your finger on the one , the only , point of difference , ' assented Blake , On our way home he took my arm , and pitched his voice in the key of confidence . ' I am writing my autobiography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . It will be in two parts ; the interim when people thought me dead , marking their separation . I was not dead ; I slept a dreamless sleep . Presently I shall sleep again ; as men say , die ; then doubtless wake again . Life and death are but sleeping and waking on a larger scale . Our little life is rounded with a sleep . It is the swing of the pendulum , the revolution of the orb . Yes , I am writing my autobiography . So little is known of the private history of Shakespeare , conceive the boon it will be to mankind . I shall leave the manuscripts to my executors , for them to publish after I have lain down to my next long rest . Of special value will be the chapters telling how I wrote the plays , settling disputed readings , closing all controversy upon the sanity of Hamlet , and divulging the true personality of Mr. W.H.

' Yes , ' he sighed at last , ' it is solely in the quantity of my hair that the resemblance fails .

I suppose he is the only man in two hemispheres who finds the opposite condition a matter of regret . FLOWER O ' THE QUINCE I. Theodore Vellan had been out of England for more than thirty years . Thirty odd years ago the set he lived in had been startled and mystified by his sudden flight and disappearance . At that time his position here had seemed a singularly pleasant one . He was young -- he was seven- or eight-and-twenty ; he was fairly well off -- he had something like three thousand a year , indeed ; he belonged to an excellent family , the Shropshire Vellans , of whom the titled head , Lord Vellan of Norshingfield , was his uncle ; he was good-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just won a seat in the House of Commons ( as junior member for Sheffingham ) , where , since he was believed to be ambitious as well as clever , it was generally expected that he would go far . Then , quite suddenly , he had applied for the Chiltern Hundreds , and left England . His motives for this unlikely course he explained to no one . To a few intimate friends he wrote brief letters of farewell . ' I am off for a journey round the world . I shall be gone an indefinite time . ' The indefinite time ended by defining itself as upwards of thirty years , for the first twenty of which only his solicitor and his bankers could have given you his address , and they would n't . For the last ten he was understood to be living in the island of Porto Rico , and planting sugar . Meanwhile his uncle had died , and his cousin ( his uncle 's only son ) had succeeded to the peerage . But the other day his cousin , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates and dignities had devolved upon himself . With that , a return to England became an obligation ; there were a score of minor beneficiaries under his cousin 's will , whose legacies could not , without great delay , be paid unless the new lord was at hand . II . Mrs Sandryl-Kempton sat before the fire in her wide , airy , faded drawing-room , and thought of the Theodore Vellan of old days , and wondered what the present Lord Vellan would be like . She had got a note from him that morning , despatched from Southampton the day before , announcing , ' I shall be in town to-morrow -- at Bowden 's Hotel , in Cork Street , ' and asking when he might come to her . She had answered by telegraph , ' Come and dine at eight to-night , ' to which he had wired back an acceptance . Thereupon , she had told her son that he must dine at his club ; and now she was seated before her fire , waiting for Theodore Vellan to arrive , and thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her husband , her brother Paul , and Theodore Vellan were bound in a league of ardent young-mannish friendship , a friendship that dated from the time when they had been undergraduates together at Oxford . She thought of the three handsome , happy , highly-endowed young men , and of the brilliant future she had foreseen for each of them : her husband at the Bar , her brother in the Church , and Vellan -- not in politics , she could never understand his political aspirations , they seemed quite at odds with the rest of his character -- but in literature , as a poet , for he wrote verse which she considered very unusual and pleasing . She thought of this , and then she remembered that her husband was dead , that her brother was dead , and that Theodore Vellan had been dead to his world , at all events , for thirty years . Not one of them had in any way distinguished himself ; not one had in any measure fulfilled the promise of his youth . Her memories were sweet and bitter ; they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled him , had been , before all things , gentle . He was witty , he had humour , he had imagination ; but he was , before all things , gentle -- with the gentlest voice , the gentlest eyes , the gentlest manners . His gentleness , she told herself , was the chief element of his charm -- his gentleness , which was really a phase of his modesty . ' He was very gentle , he was very modest , he was very graceful and kind , ' she said ; and she remembered a hundred instances of his gentleness , his modesty , his kindness . Oh , but he was no milksop . He had plenty of spirit , plenty of fun ; he was boyish , he could romp . And at that , a scene repeated itself to her mind , a scene that had passed in this same drawing-room more than thirty years ago . It was tea-time , and on the tea-table lay a dish of pearl biscuits , and she and her husband and Vellan were alone . Her husband took a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air , while Vellan threw back his head , and caught them in his mouth as they came down -- that was one of his accomplishments . She smiled as she remembered it , but at the same time she put her handkerchief to her eyes . ' Why did he go away ? What could it have been ? ' she wondered , her old bewilderment at his conduct , her old longing to comprehend it , reviving with something of the old force . ' Could it have been ... ? Could it have been ... ? ' And an old guess , an old theory , one she had never spoken to anybody , but had pondered much in silence , again presented itself interrogatively to her mind . The door opened ; the butler mumbled a name ; and she saw a tall , white-haired , pale old man smiling at her and holding out his hands . It took her a little while to realise who it was . With an unthinking disallowance for the action of time , she had been expecting a young fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his side , was taken aback a little to meet a middle-aged lady in a cap . III . After dinner he would not let her leave him , but returned with her to the drawing-room , and she said that he might smoke . He smoked odd little Cuban cigarettes , whereof the odour was delicate and aromatic . They had talked of everything ; they had laughed and sighed over their ancient joys and sorrows . We know how , in the Courts of Memory , Mirth and Melancholy wander hand in hand . She had cried a little when her husband and her brother were first spoken of , but at some comic reminiscence of them , a moment afterwards , she was smiling through her tears . ' Do you remember so-and-so ? ' and ' What has become of such-a-one ? ' were types of the questions they asked each other , conjuring up old friends and enemies like ghosts out of the past . Incidentally , he had described Porto Rico and its negroes and its Spaniards , its climate , its fauna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the fire , and were silent for a bit . Profiting by the permission she had given him , he produced one of his Cuban cigarettes , opened it at its ends , unrolled it , rolled it up again , and lit it . ' Now the time has come for you to tell me what I most want to know , ' she said . ' What is that ? ' ' Why you went away . ' ' Oh , ' he murmured . She waited a minute . Then , ' Tell me , ' she urged . ' Do you remember Mary Isona ? ' he asked . She glanced up at him suddenly , as if startled . ' Mary Isona ? Yes , of course . ' ' Well , I was in love with her . ' ' You were in love with Mary Isona ? ' ' I was very much in love with her . I have never got over it , I 'm afraid . ' She gazed fixedly at the fire . Her lips were compressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frock , with a sensitive , pale face , luminous , sad , dark eyes , and a mass of dark , waving hair -- Mary Isona , of Italian parentage , a little music teacher , whose only relation to the world Theodore Vellan lived in was professional . She came into it for an hour or two at a time now and then , to play or to give a music lesson . ' Yes , ' he repeated ; ' I was in love with her . I have never been in love with any other woman . It seems ridiculous for an old man to say it , but I am in love with her still . An old man ? Are we ever really old ? Our body grows old , our skin wrinkles , our hair turns white ; but the mind , the spirit , the heart ? The thing we call " I " ? Anyhow , not a day , not an hour , passes , but I think of her , I long for her , I mourn for her . You knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing ? Her wonderful eyes ? Her beautiful pale face ? And how the hair grew round her forehead ? And her talk , her voice , her intelligence ! Her taste , her instinct , in literature , in art -- it was the finest I have ever met . ' ' Yes , yes , yes , ' Mrs. Kempton said slowly . ' She was a rare woman . I knew her intimately ,  - -  better than any one else , I think . I knew all the unhappy circumstances of her life : her horrid , vulgar mother ; her poor , dreamy , inefficient father ; her poverty , how hard she had to work . You were in love with her . Why did n't you marry her ? ' ' My love was not returned . ' ' Did you ask her ? ' ' No . It was needless . It went without saying . ' ' You never can tell . You ought to have asked her . ' ' It was on the tip of my tongue , of course , to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself with the question whether I had any chance , in hoping and fearing . But as often as I found myself alone with her I knew it was hopeless . Her manner to me -- it was one of frank friendliness . There was no mistaking it . She never thought of loving me . ' ' You were wrong not to ask her . One never can be sure . Oh , why did n't you ask her ? ' His old friend spoke with great feeling . He looked at her , surprised and eager . ' Do you really think she might have cared for me ? ' ' Oh , you ought to have told her : you ought to have asked her , ' she repeated . ' Well -- now you know why I went away . ' ' Yes . ' ' When I heard of her -- her -- death '  - -  he could not bring himself to say her suicide -- 'there was nothing else for me to do . It was so hideous , so unutterable . To go on with my old life , in the old place , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow her , to do what she had done . The only alternative was to fly as far from England , as far from myself , as I could . ' ' Sometimes , ' Mrs. Kempton confessed by-and-bye , ' sometimes I wondered whether , possibly , your disappearance could have had any such connection with Mary 's death -- it followed it so immediately . I wondered sometimes whether , perhaps , you had cared for her . But I could n't believe it -- it was only because the two things happened one upon the other . Oh , why did n't you tell her ? It is dreadful , dreadful ! ' IV . When he had left her , she sat still for a little while before the fire . ' Life is a chance to make mistakes -- a chance to make mistakes . Life is a chance to make mistakes . ' It was a phrase she had met in a book she was reading the other day : then she had smiled at it ; now it rang in her ears like the voice of a mocking demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said , half aloud . She rose and went to her desk , unlocked a drawer , turned over its contents , and took out a letter -- an old letter , for the paper was yellow and the ink was faded . She came back to the fireside , and unfolded the letter and read it . It covered six pages of note-paper , in a small feminine hand . It was a letter Mary Isona had written to her , Margaret Kempton , the night before she died , more than thirty years ago . The writer recounted the many harsh circumstances of her life ; but they would all have been bearable , she said , save for one great and terrible secret . She had fallen in love with a man who was scarcely conscious of her existence ; she , a little obscure Italian music teacher , had fallen in love with Theodore Vellan . It was as if she had fallen in love with an inhabitant of another planet : the worlds they respectively belonged to were so far apart She loved him -- she loved him -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear it . Oh , yes ; she met him sometimes , here and there , at houses she went to to play , to give lessons . He was civil to her : he was more than civil -- he was kind ; he talked to her about literature and music . ' He is so gentle , so strong , so wise ; but he has never thought of me as a woman -- a woman who could love , who could be loved . Why should he ? If the moth falls in love with the star , the moth must suffer .... I am cowardly ; I am weak ; I am what you will ; but I have more than I can bear . Life is too hard -- too hard . To-morrow I shall be dead . You will be the only person to know why I died , and you will keep my secret . ' ' Oh , the pity of it -- the pity of it ! ' murmured Mrs. Kempton . ' I wonder whether I ought to have shown him Mary 's letter . ' WHEN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faire ? ' I had wandered into a tangle of slummy streets , and began to think it time to inquire my way back to the hotel : then , turning a corner , I came out upon the quays . At one hand there was the open night , with the dim forms of many ships , and stars hanging in a web of masts and cordage ; at the other , the garish illumination of a row of public-houses : Au Bonheur du Matelot , Cafe de la Marine , Brasserie des Quatre Vents , and so forth ; rowdy-looking shops enough , designed for the entertainment of the forecastle . But they seemed to promise something in the nature of local colour ; and I entered the Brasserie des Quatre Vents . It proved to be a brasserie-a-femmes ; you were waited upon by ladies , lavishly rouged and in regardless toilets , who would sit with you and chat , and partake of refreshments at your expense . The front part of the room was filled up with tables , where half a hundred customers , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ din -- sailors , soldiers , a few who might be clerks or tradesmen , and an occasional workman in his blouse . Beyond , there was a cleared space , reserved for dancing , occupied by a dozen couples , clumsily toeing it ; and on a platform , at the far end , a man pounded a piano . All this in an atmosphere hot as a furnace-blast , and poisonous with the fumes of gas , the smells of bad tobacco , of musk , alcohol , and humanity . The musician faced away from the company , so that only his shoulders and the back of his grey head were visible , bent over his keyboard . It was sad to see a grey head in that situation ; and one wondered what had brought it there , what story of vice or weakness or evil fortune . Though his instrument was harsh , and he had to bang it violently to be heard above the roar of conversation , the man played with a kind of cleverness , and with certain fugitive suggestions of good style . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations , who now , in his age , was come to serve the revels of a set of drunken sailors , in a disreputable tavern , where they danced with prostitutes . I do n't know why , but from the first he drew my attention ; and I left my handmaid to count her charms neglected , while I sat and watched him , speculating about him in a melancholy way , with a sort of vicarious shame . But presently something happened to make me forget him -- something of his own doing . A dance had ended , and after a breathing spell he began to play an interlude . It was an instance of how tunes , like perfumes , have the power to wake sleeping memories . The tune he was playing now , simple and dreamy like a lullaby , and strangely at variance with the surroundings , whisked me off in a twinkling , far from the actual -- ten , fifteen years backwards -- to my student life in Paris , and set me to thinking , as I had not thought for many a long day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pair ; for it was a tune of Pair 's composition , a melody he had written to a nursery rhyme , and used to sing a good deal , half in fun , half in earnest , to his lady-love , Godelinette : ' Lavender 's blue , diddle-diddle , Lavender 's green ; When I am king , diddle-diddle , You shall be queen . ' It is certain he meant very seriously that if he ever came into his kingdom , Godelinette should be queen . The song had been printed , but , so far as I knew , had never had much vogue ; and it seemed an odd chance that this evening , in a French seaport town where I was passing a single night , I should stray by hazard into a sailors ' pothouse and hear it again . * * * * * Edmund Pair lived in the Latin Quarter when I did , but he was no longer a mere student . He had published a good many songs ; articles had been written about them in the newspapers ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' arrived '  - -  actors , painters , musicians , authors , and now and then a politician -- who thus recognised him as more or less one of themselves . Everybody liked him ; everybody said , ' He is splendidly gifted ; he will go far . ' A few of us already addressed him , half-playfully perhaps , as cher maitre . He was three or four years older than I -- eight- or nine-and-twenty to my twenty-five -- and I was still in the schools ; but for all that we were great chums . Quite apart from his special talent , he was a remarkable man -- amusing in talk , good-looking , generous , affectionate . He had read ; he had travelled ; he had hob-and-nobbed with all sorts and conditions of people . He had wit , imagination , humour , and a voice that made whatever he said a cordial to the ear . For myself , I admired him , enjoyed him , loved him , with equal fervour ; he had all of my hero-worship , and the lion 's share of my friendship ; perhaps I was vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We used to spend two or three evenings a week together , at his place or at mine , or over the table of a cafe , talking till the small hours -- Elysian sessions , at which we smoked more cigarettes and emptied more bocks than I should care to count . On Sundays and holidays we would take long walks arm-in-arm in the Bois , or , accompanied by Godelinette , go to Viroflay or Fontainebleau , lunch in the open , bedeck our hats with wildflowers , and romp like children . He was tall and slender , with dark waving hair , a delicate aquiline profile , a clear brown skin , and grey eyes , alert , intelligent , kindly . I fancy the Boulevard St. Michel , flooded with sunshine , broken here and there by long crisp shadows ; trams and omnibuses toiling up the hill , tooting their horns ; students and etudiantes sauntering gaily backwards and forwards on the trottoir ; an odour of asphalte , of caporal tobacco ; myself one of the multitude on the terrace of a cafe ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stride , a gesture of salutation , a laughing face ; she in the freshest of bright-coloured spring toilets : I fancy this , and it seems an adventure of the golden age . Then we would drink our aperitifs , our Turin bitter , perhaps our absinthe , and go off to dine together in the garden at Lavenue 's . Godelinette was a child of the people , but Pair had done wonders by way of civilising her . She had learned English , and prattled it with an accent so quaint and sprightly as to give point to her otherwise perhaps somewhat commonplace observations . She was fond of reading ; she could play a little ; she was an excellent housewife , and generally a very good-natured and quite presentable little person . She was Parisian and adaptable . To meet her , you would never have suspected her origin ; you would have found it hard to believe that she had been the wife of a drunken tailor , who used to beat her . One January night , four or five years before , Pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gay-Lussac . He hastened to remonstrate ; and the husband went off , hiccoughing of his outraged rights , and calling the universe to witness that he would have the law of the meddling stranger . Pair picked the girl up ( she was scarcely eighteen then , and had only been married a sixmonth ) , he picked her up from where she had fallen , half fainting , on the pavement , carried her to his lodgings , which were at hand , and sent for a doctor . In his manuscript-littered study , for rather more than nine weeks , she lay on a bed of fever , the consequence of blows , exhaustion , and exposure . When she got well there was no talk of her leaving . Pair could n't let her go back to her tailor ; he could n't turn her into the streets . Besides , during the months that he had nursed her , he had somehow conceived a great tenderness for her ; it made his heart burn with grief and anger to think of what she had suffered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfort her for the future . This perhaps was no more than natural ; but , what rather upset the calculations of his friends , she , towards whom he had established himself in the relation of a benefactor , bore him , instead of a grudge therefor , a passionate gratitude and affection . So , Pair said , they were only waiting till her tailor should drink himself to death , to get married ; and meanwhile , he exacted for her all the respect that would have been due to his wife ; and everybody called her by his name . She was a pretty little thing , very daintily formed , with tiny hands and feet , and big gipsyish brown eyes ; and very delicate , very fragile -- she looked as if anything might carry her off . Her name , Godeleine , seeming much too grand and mediaeval for so small and actual a person , Pair had turned it into Godelinette . We all said , ' He is splendidly gifted ; he will do great things . ' He had studied at Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned , enlightened , and extremely modern ; he was a hard worker . We said he would do great things ; but I thought in those days , and indeed I still think -- and , what is more to the purpose , men who were themselves musicians and composers , men whose names are known , were before me in thinking -- that he had already done great things , that the songs he had already published were achievements . They seemed to us original in conception , accomplished and felicitous in treatment ; they were full of melody and movement , full of harmonic surprises ; they had style and they had ' go . ' One would have imagined they must please at once the cultivated and the general public . I could never understand why they were n't popular . They would be printed ; they would be praised at length , and under distinguished signatures , in the reviews ; they would enjoy an unusual success of approbation ; but -- they would n't sell , and they would n't get themselves sung at concerts . If they had been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people -- but they were n't . Plenty of work quite as good , quite as modern , yet no whit more tuneful or interesting , was making its authors rich . We could n't understand it , we had to conclude it was a fluke , a question of chance , of accident . Pair was still a very young man ; he must go on knocking , and some day -- to-morrow , next week , next year , but some day certainly -- the door of public favour would be opened to him . Meanwhile his position was by no means an unenviable one , goodness knows . To have your orbit in the art world of Paris , and to be recognised there as a star ; to be written about in the Revue des Deux-Mondes ; to possess the friendship of the masters , to know that they believe in you , to hear them prophesy , ' He will do great things '  - -  all that is something , even if your wares do n't ' take on ' in the market-place . ' It 's a good job , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Pair said ; and there indeed he touched a salient point . His people were dead ; his father had been a younger son ; he had no money of his own . But his father 's elder brother , a squire in Hampshire , made him rather a liberal allowance , something like six hundred a year , I believe , which was opulence in the Latin Quarter . Now , the squire had been aware of Pair 's relation with Godelinette from its inception , and had not disapproved . On his visits to Paris he had dined with them , given them dinners , and treated her with the utmost complaisance . But when , one fine morning , her tailor died , and my quixotic friend announced his intention of marrying her , dans les delais legaux , the squire protested . I think I read the whole correspondence , and I remember that in the beginning the elder man took the tone of paradox and banter . ' Behave dishonourably , my dear fellow . I have winked at your mistress heretofore , because boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marries . And , anyhow , a woman is so much more interesting in a false position . ' But he soon became serious , presently furious , and , when the marriage was an accomplished fact , cut off the funds . ' Never mind , my dear , ' said Pair . ' We will go to London and seek our fortune . We will write the songs of the people , and let who will make the laws . We will grow rich and famous , and " When I am king , diddle-diddle , You shall be queen ! " ' * * * * * So they went to London to seek their fortune , and -- that was the last I ever saw of them , nearly the last I heard . I had two letters from Pair , written within a month of their hegira -- gossipy , light-hearted letters , describing the people they were meeting , reporting Godelinette 's quaint observations upon England and English things , explaining his hopes , his intentions , all very confidently -- and then I had no more . I wrote again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course I ceased to write . I was hurt and puzzled ; but in the spring we should meet in London , and could have it out . When the spring came , however , my plans were altered : I had to go to America . I went by way of Havre , expecting to stay six weeks , and was gone six years . On my return to England I said to people , ' You have a brilliant young composer named Pair . Can you put me in the way of procuring his address ? ' The fortune he had come to seek he would surely have found ; he would be a known man . But people looked blank , and declared they had never heard of him . I applied to music-publishers -- with the same result . I wrote to his uncle in Hampshire ; the squire did not reply . When I reached Paris I inquired of our friends there ; they were as ignorant as I. ' He must be dead , ' I concluded . ' If he had lived , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And I wondered what had become of Godelinette . Then another eight or ten years passed , and now , in a waterside public at Bordeaux , an obscure old pianist was playing Pair 's setting of ' Lavender 's blue , ' and stirring a hundred bitter-sweet far-away memories of my friend . It was as if fifteen years were erased from my life . The face of Godelinette was palpable before me -- pale , with its sad little smile , its bright appealing eyes . Edmund might have been smoking across the table -- I could hear his voice , I could have put out my hand and touched him . And all round me were the streets , the lights , the smells , the busy youthful va-et-vient of the Latin Quarter ; and in my heart the yearning , half joy and all despair and anguish , with which we think of the old days when we were young , of how real and dear they were , of how irrecoverable they are . And then the music stopped , the Brasserie des Quatre Vents became a glaring reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked plaintively , ' Tu n'es pas rigolo , toi . Veux-tu faire une valse ? ' ' I must speak to your musician , ' I said . ' Excuse me . ' He had played a bit of Pair 's music . It was one chance in a thousand , but I wanted to ask him whether he could tell me anything about the composer . So I penetrated to the bottom of the shop , and approached his platform . He was bending over some sheets of music -- making his next selection , doubtless . ' I beg your pardon --  , ' I began . He turned towards me . You will not be surprised -- I was looking into Pair 's own face . * * * * * You will not be surprised , but you will imagine what it was for me . Oh , yes , I recognised him instantly ; there could be no mistake . And he recognised me , for he flushed , and winced , and started back . I suppose for a little while we were both of us speechless , speechless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I said -- something had to be said to break the situation -- I think I said , ' It 's you , Edmund ? ' I remember he fumbled with a sheet of music , and kept his eyes bent on it , and muttered something inarticulate . Then there was another speechless , helpless suspension . He continued to fumble his music without looking up . At last I remember saying , through a sort of sickness and giddiness , ' Let us get out of here -- where we can talk . ' ' I ca n't leave yet . I 've got another dance , ' he answered . ' Well , I 'll wait , ' said I. I sat down near him and waited , trying to create some kind of order out of the chaos in my mind , and half automatically watching and considering him as he played his dance -- Edmund Pair playing a dance for prostitutes and drunken sailors . He was not greatly changed . There were the same grey eyes , deep-set and wide apart , under the same broad forehead ; the same fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole face was pretty much the same , only thinner perhaps , and with a look of apathy , of inanimation , that was foreign to my recollection of it . His hair had turned quite white , but otherwise he appeared no older than his years . His figure , tall , slender , well-knit , retained its vigour and its distinction . Though he wore a shabby brown Norfolk jacket , and his beard was two days old , you could in no circumstances have taken him for anything but a gentleman . I waited anxiously for the time when we should be alone -- anxiously , yet with a sort of terror . I was burning to understand , and yet I shrunk from doing so . If to conjecture even vaguely what experiences could have brought him to this , what dark things suffered or done , had been melancholy when he was a nameless old musician , now it was appalling , and I dreaded the explanation that I longed to hear . At last he struck his final chord , and rose from the piano . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , I 'm ready . ' He , apparently , had in some measure pulled himself together . In the street he took my arm . ' Let 's walk in this direction , ' he said , leading off , ' towards the Christian quarter of the town . ' And in a moment he went on : ' This has been an odd meeting . What brings you to Bordeaux ? ' I explained that I was on my way to Biarritz , stopping for the night between two trains . ' Then it 's all the more surprising that you should have stumbled into the Brasserie des Quatre Vents . You 've altered very slightly . The world wags well with you ? You look prosperous . ' I cried out some incoherent protest . Afterwards I said , ' You know what I want to hear . What does this mean ? ' He laughed nervously . ' Oh , the meaning 's clear enough . It speaks for itself . ' ' I do n't understand , ' said I. ' I 'm pianist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the discharge of my duties . ' ' I do n't understand , ' I repeated helplessly . ' And yet the inference is plain . What could have brought a man to such a pass save drink or evil courses ? ' ' Oh , do n't trifle , ' I implored him . ' I 'm not trifling . That 's the worst of it . For I do n't drink , and I 'm not conscious of having pursued any especially evil courses . ' ' Well ? ' I questioned . ' Well ? ' ' The fact of the matter simply is that I 'm what they call a failure . I never came off . ' ' I do n't understand , ' I repeated for a third time . ' No more do I , if you come to that . It 's the will of Heaven , I suppose . Anyhow , it ca n't puzzle you more than it puzzles me . It seems contrary to the whole logic of circumstances , but it 's the fact ' Thus far he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an affectation of indifference ; but after a little silence his mood appeared to change . His hand upon my arm tightened its grasp , and he began to speak rapidly , feelingly . ' Do you realise that it is nearly fifteen years since we have seen each other ? The history of those fifteen years , so far as I am concerned , has been the history of a single uninterrupted deveine -- one continuous run of ill-luck , against every probability of the game , against every effort I could make to play my cards effectively . When I started out , one might have thought , I had the best of chances . I had studied hard ; I worked hard . I surely had as much general intelligence , as much special knowledge , as much apparent talent , as my competitors . And the stuff I produced seemed good to you , to my friends , and not wholly bad to me . It was musicianly , it was melodious , it was sincere ; the critics all praised it ; but -- it never took on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack ? I do n't know . At last I could n't even get it published -- invisible ink ! And I had a wife to support . ' He paused for a minute ; then : ' You see , ' he said , ' we made the mistake , when we were young , of believing , against wise authority , that it was in mortals to command success , that he could command it who deserved it . We believed that the race would be to the swift , the battle to the strong ; that a man was responsible for his own destiny , that he 'd get what he merited . We believed that honest labour could n't go unrewarded . An immense mistake . Success is an affair of temperament , like faith , like love , like the colour of your hair . Oh , the old story about industry , resolution , and no vices ! I was industrious , I was resolute , and I had no more than the common share of vices . But I had the unsuccessful temperament ; and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see that they were . I wanted to earn a decent living ; I wanted to justify my existence by doing something worthy of the world 's acceptance . But the stars in their courses fought against me . I have tried hard to convince myself that the music I wrote was rubbish . It had its faults , no doubt . It was n't great , it was n't epoch-making . But , as music goes nowadays , it was jolly good . It was a jolly sight better than the average . ' ' Oh , that is certain , that is certain , ' I exclaimed , as he paused again . ' Well , anyhow , it did n't sell , and at last I could n't even get it published . So then I tried to find other work . I tried everything . I tried to teach -- harmony and the theory of composition . I could n't get pupils . So few people want to study that sort of thing , and there were good masters already in the place . If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never better than a fifth-rate executant ; I had never gone in for that ; my " lay " was composition . I could n't give piano lessons , I could n't play in public -- unless in a gargotte like the hole we have just left . Oh , I tried everything . I tried to get musical criticism to do for the newspapers . Surely I was competent to do musical criticism . But no -- they would n't employ me . I had ill luck , ill luck , ill luck -- nothing but ill luck , defeat , disappointment . Was it the will of Heaven ? I wondered what unforgiveable sin I had committed to be punished so . Do you know what it is like to work and pray and wait , day after day , and watch day after day come and go and bring you nothing ? Oh , I tasted the whole heart-sickness of hope deferred ; Giant Despair was my constant bed-fellow . ' ' But -- with your connections --  ' I began . ' Oh , my connections ! ' he cried . ' There was the rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer cold blood and heartlessness give Londoners the palm . I had connections enough for the first month or so , and then people found out things that did n't concern them . They found out some things that were true , and they imagined other things that were false . They would n't have my wife ; they told the most infamous lies about her ; and I would n't have them . Could I be civil to people who insulted and slandered her ? I had no connections in London , except with the underworld . I got down to copying parts for theatrical orchestras ; and working twelve hours a day , earned about thirty shillings a week . ' ' You might have come back to Paris . ' ' And fared worse . I could n't have earned thirty pence in Paris . Mind you , the only trade I had learned was that of a musical composer ; and I could n't compose music that people would buy . I should have starved as a copyist in Paris , where copyists are more numerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of harmony in London there are ten in Paris . No ; it was a hopeless case . ' ' It is **34;3234;TOOLONG , ' said I. ' But wait -- wait till you 've heard the end . One would think I had had enough -- not so ? One would think my cup of bitterness was full . No fear ! There was a stronger cup still a-brewing for me . When Fortune takes a grudge against a man , she never lets up . She exacts the uttermost farthing . I was pretty badly off , but I had one treasure left -- I had Godelinette . I used to think that she was my compensation . I would say to myself , " A man ca n't have all blessings . How can you expect others , when you 've got her ? " And I would accuse myself of ingratitude for complaining of my unsuccess . Then she fell ill . My God , how I watched over , prayed over her ! It seemed impossible -- I could not believe -- that she would be taken from me . Yet , Harry , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what her dying thoughts were -- her wishes ? Throughout her long painful illness she was thinking that she was an obstacle in my way , a weight upon me ; that if it were n't for her , I should get on , have friends , a position ; that it would be a good thing for me if she should die ; and she was hoping in her poor little heart that she would n't get well ! Oh , I know it , I knew it -- and you see me here alive . She let herself die for my sake -- as if I could care for anything without her . That 's what brought us here , to France , to Bordeaux -- her illness . The doctors said she must pass the spring out of England , away from the March winds , in the South ; and I begged and borrowed money enough to take her . And we were on our way to Arcachon ; but when we reached Bordeaux she was too ill to continue the journey , and -- she died here . ' We walked on for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was four years ago . You wonder why I live to tell you of it , why I have n't cut my throat . I do n't know whether it 's cowardice or conscientious scruples . It seems rather inconsequent to say that I believe in a God , does n't it ?  - -  that I believe one 's life is not one 's own to make an end of ? Anyhow , here I am , keeping body and soul together as musician to a brasserie-a-femmes . I ca n't go back to England , I ca n't leave Bordeaux -- she 's buried here . I 've hunted high and low for work , and found it nowhere save in the brasserie-a-femmes . With that , and a little copying now and then , I manage to pay my way . ' ' But your uncle ? ' I asked . ' Do you think I would touch a penny of his money ? ' Pair retorted , almost fiercely . ' It was he who began it . My wife let herself die . It was virtual suicide . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' You are his heir , though , are n't you ? ' ' No , the estates are not entailed . ' We had arrived at the door of my hotel . ' Well , good-night and bon voyage , ' he said . ' You need n't wish me bon voyage , ' I answered . ' Of course I 'm not leaving Bordeaux for the present . ' ' Oh , yes , you are . You 're going on to Biarritz to-morrow morning , as you intended . ' And herewith began a long and most painful struggle . I could persuade him to accept no help of any sort from me . ' What I ca n't do for myself , ' he declared , ' I 'll do without . My dear fellow , all that you propose is contrary to the laws of Nature . One man ca n't keep another -- it 's an impossible relation . And I wo n't be kept ; I wo n't be a burden . Besides , to tell you the truth , I 've got past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ; to me it 's no worse than another . You see , I 'm hardened ; I 've got past caring . ' ' At any rate , ' I insisted , ' I sha n't go on to Biarritz . I 'll spend my holiday here , and we can see each other every day . What time shall we meet to-morrow ? ' ' No , no , I ca n't meet you again . Do n't ask me to ; you mean it kindly , I know , but you 're mistaken . It 's done me good to talk it all out to you , but I ca n't meet you again . I 've got no heart for friendship , and -- you remind me too keenly of many things . ' ' But if I come to the brasserie to-morrow night ? ' ' Oh , if you do that , you 'll oblige me to throw up my employment there , and hide from you . You must promise not to come again -- you must respect my wishes . ' ' You 're cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I think I 'm only reasonable . Anyhow , good-bye . ' He shook my hand hurriedly , and moved off . What could I do ? I stood looking after him till he had vanished in the night , with a miserable baffled recognition of my helplessness to help him . A RESPONSIBILITY It has been an episode like a German sentence , with its predicate at the end . Trifling incidents occurred at haphazard , as it seemed , and I never guessed they were by way of making sense . Then , this morning , somewhat of the suddenest , came the verb and the full stop . Yesterday I should have said there was nothing to tell ; to-day there is too much . The announcement of his death has caused me to review our relations , with the result of discovering my own part to have been that of an accessory before the fact . I did not kill him ( though , even there , I 'm not sure I did n't lend a hand ) , but I might have saved his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress -- faint , shy , tentative , but unmistakable -- and that I pretended not to understand : just barely dipped my colours , and kept my course . Oh , if I had dreamed that his distress was extreme -- that he was on the point of foundering and going down ! However , that does n't exonerate me : I ought to have turned aside to find out . It was a case of criminal negligence . That he , poor man , probably never blamed me , only adds to the burden on my conscience . He had got past blaming people , I dare say , and doubtless merely lumped me with the rest -- with the sum-total of things that made life unsupportable . Yet , for a moment , when we first met , his face showed a distinct glimmering of hope ; so perhaps there was a distinct disappointment . He must have had so many disappointments , before it came to -- what it came to ; but it would n't have come to that if he had got hardened to them . Possibly they had lost their outlines , and merged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . I wonder whether the Priest and the Levite were smitten with remorse after they had passed on . Unfortunately , in this instance , no good Samaritan followed . The bottom of our long table d'hote was held by a Frenchman , a Normand , a giant , but a pallid and rather flabby giant , whose name , if he had another than Monsieur , I never heard . He professed to be a painter , used to sketch birds and profiles on the back of his menu-card between the courses , wore shamelessly the multi-coloured rosette of a foreign order in his buttonhole , and talked with a good deal of physiognomy . I had the corner seat at his right , and was flanked in turn by Miss Etta J. Hicks , a bouncing young person from Chicago , beyond whom , like rabbits in a company of foxes , cowered Mr. and Mrs. Jordan P. Hicks , two broken-spirited American parents . At Monsieur 's left , and facing me , sat Colonel Escott , very red and cheerful ; then a young man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaiming himself a barr'ster , and giving his name as Flarty , though on his card it was written Flaherty ; and then Sir Richard Maistre . After him , a diminishing perspective of busy diners -- for purposes of conversation , so far as we were concerned , inhabitants of the Fourth Dimension . Of our immediate constellation , Sir Richard Maistre was the only member on whom the eye was tempted to linger . The others were obvious -- simple equations , soluble ' in the head . ' But he called for slate and pencil , offered materials for doubt and speculation , though it would not have been easy to tell wherein they lay . What displayed itself to a cursory inspection was quite unremarkable : simply a decent-looking young Englishman , of medium stature , with square-cut plain features , reddish-brown hair , grey eyes , and clothes and manners of the usual pattern . Yet , showing through this ordinary surface , there was something cryptic . For me , at any rate , it required a constant effort not to stare at him . I felt it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a teasing curiosity , a sort of magnetism that drew my eyes in his direction . I was always on my guard to resist it , and that was really the inception of my neglect of him . From I do n't know what stupid motive of pride , I was anxious that he should n't discern the interest he had excited in me ; so I paid less ostensible attention to him than to the others , who excited none at all . I tried to appear unconscious of him as a detached personality , to treat him as merely a part of the group as a whole . Then I improved such occasions as presented themselves to steal glances at him , study him a la derobee -- groping after the quality , whatever it was , that made him a puzzle -- seeking to formulate , to classify him . Already , at the end of my first dinner , he had singled himself out and left an impression . I went into the smoking-room , and began to wonder , over a cup of coffee and a cigarette , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't talked much , and his few observations had been murmured into the ears of his next neighbours . All the same , he had left an impression , and I found myself wondering who he was , the young man with the square-cut features and the reddish-brown hair . I have said that his features were square-cut and plain , but they were small and carefully finished , and as far as possible from being common . And his grey eyes , though not conspicuous for size or beauty , had a character , an expression . They said something , something I could n't perfectly translate , something shrewd , humorous , even perhaps a little caustic , and yet sad ; not violently , not rebelliously sad ( I should never have dreamed that it was a sadness which would drive him to desperate remedies ) , but rather resignedly , submissively sad , as if he had made up his mind to put the best face on a sorry business . This was carried out by a certain abruptness , a slight lack of suavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , of using his hands . It hinted a degree of determination which , in the circumstances , seemed superfluous . He had unfolded his napkin and attacked his dinner with an air of resolution , like a man with a task before him , who mutters , ' Well , it 's got to be done , and I 'll do it . ' At a hazard , he was two- or three-and-thirty , but below his neck he looked older . He was dressed like everybody , but his costume had , somehow , an effect of soberness beyond his years . It was decidedly not smart , and smartness was the dominant note at the Hotel d'Angleterre . I was still more or less vaguely ruminating him , in a corner of the smoking-room , on that first evening , when I became aware that he was standing near me . As I looked up , our eyes met , and for the fraction of a second fixed each other . It was barely the fraction of a second , but it was time enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had said so that he wanted to speak , to break the ice , to scrape an acquaintance ; I knew that he had approached me and was loitering in my neighbourhood for that specific purpose . I do n't know , I have studied the psychology of the moment in vain to understand , why I felt a perverse impulse to put him off . I was interested in him , I was curious about him ; and there he stood , testifying that the interest was reciprocal , ready to make the advances , only waiting for a glance or a motion of encouragement ; and I deliberately secluded myself behind my coffee-cup and my cigarette smoke . I suppose it was the working of some obscure mannish vanity -- of what in a woman would have defined itself as coyness and coquetry . If he wanted to speak -- well , let him speak ; I would n't help him . I could realise the processes of his mind even more clearly than those of my own -- his desire , his hesitancy . He was too timid to leap the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hovered near me for a minute longer , and then drifted away . I felt his disappointment , his spiritual shrug of the shoulders ; and I perceived rather suddenly that I was disappointed myself . I must have been hoping all along that he would speak quand meme , and now I was moved to run after him , to call him back . That , however , would imply a consciousness of guilt , an admission that my attitude had been intentional ; so I kept my seat , making a mental rendezvous with him for the morrow . Between my Irish vis-a-vis Flaherty and myself there existed no such strain . He presently sauntered up to me , and dropped into conversation as easily as if we had been old friends . ' Well , and are you here for your health or your entertainment ? ' he began . ' But I do n't need to ask that of a man who 's drinking black coffee and smoking tobacco at this hour of the night . I 'm the only invalid at our end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meself . It 's a barrister 's throat I have -- I caught it waiting for briefs in me chambers at Doblin . ' We chatted together for a half-hour or so , and before we parted he had given me a good deal of general information -- about the town , the natives , the visitors , the sands , the golf-links , the hunting , and , with the rest , about our neighbours at table . ' Did ye notice the pink-faced bald little man at me right ? That 's Cornel Escott , C.B. , retired . He takes a sea-bath every morning , to live up to the letters ; and faith , it 's an act of heroism , no less , in weather the like of this . Three weeks have I been here , and but wan day of sunshine , and the mercury never above fifty . The other fellow , him at me left , is what you 'd be slow to suspect by the look of him , I 'll go bail ; and that 's a bar'net , Sir Richard Maistre , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 's a penny . The young lady beside yourself rejoices in the euphonious name of Hicks , and trains her Popper and Mommer behind her like slaves in a Roman triumph . They 're Americans , if you must have the truth , though I ought n't to tell it on them , for I 'm an Irishman myself , and it 's not for the pot to be bearing tales of the kettle . However , their tongues bewray them ; so I 've violated no confidence . ' The knowledge that my young man was a baronet with a place in Hampshire somewhat disenchanted me . A baronet with a place in Hampshire left too little to the imagination . The description seemed to curtail his potentialities , to prescribe his orbit , to connote turnip-fields , house-parties , and a whole system of British commonplace . Yet , when , the next day at luncheon , I again had him before me in the flesh , my interest revived . Its lapse had been due to an association of ideas which I now recognised as unscientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of them all a human being ; and no human being could be finished off in a formula of half a dozen words . Sir Richard Maistre , anyhow , could n't be . He was enigmatic , and his effect upon me was enigmatic too . Why did I feel that tantalising inclination to stare at him , coupled with that reluctance frankly to engage in talk with him ? Why did he attack his luncheon with that appearance of grim resolution ? For a minute , after he had taken his seat , he eyed his knife , fork , and napkin , as a labourer might a load that he had to lift , measuring the difficulties he must cope with ; then he gave his head a resolute nod , and set to work . To-day , as yesterday , he said very little , murmured an occasional remark into the ear of Flaherty , accompanying it usually with a sudden short smile ; but he listened to everything , and did so with apparent appreciation . Our proceedings were opened by Miss Hicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you had your bath this morning ? ' The Colonel chuckled , and answered , ' Oh , yes -- yes , yes -- could n't forego my bath , you know -- could n't possibly forego my bath . ' ' And what was the temperature of the water ? ' she continued . ' **27;3270;TOOLONG degrees warmer than the air -- three degrees , ' responded the Colonel , still chuckling , as if the whole affair had been extremely funny . ' And you , Mr. Flaherty , I suppose you 've been to Bayonne ? ' ' No , I 've broken me habit , and not left the hotel . ' Subsequent experience taught me that these were conventional modes by which the conversation was launched every day , like the preliminary moves in chess . We had another ritual for dinner : Miss Hicks then inquired if the colonel had taken his ride , and Flaherty played his game of golf . The next inevitable step was common to both meals . Colonel Escott would pour himself a glass of the vin ordinaire , a jug of which was set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclaim with simulated gusto , ' Ah ! Fine old wine ! Remarkably full rich flavour ! ' At this pleasantry we would all gently laugh ; and the word was free . Sir Richard , as I have said , appeared to be an attentive and appreciative listener , not above smiling at our mildest sallies ; but , watching him out of the corner of an eye , I noticed that my own observations seemed to strike him with peculiar force -- which led me to talk at him . Why not to him , with him ? The interest was reciprocal ; he would have liked a dialogue ; he would have welcomed a chance to commence one ; and I could at any instant have given him such a chance . I talked at him , it is true ; but I talked with Flaherty or Miss Hicks , or to the company at large . Of his separate identity he had no reason to believe me conscious . From a mixture of motives , in which I 'm not sure that a certain heathenish enjoyment of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he wanted to know me he must come the whole distance ; I would n't meet him half-way . Of course I had no idea that it could be a matter of the faintest real importance to the man . I judged his feelings by my own ; and though I was interested in him , I shall have conveyed an altogether exaggerated notion of my interest if you fancy it kept me awake at night . How was I to guess that his case was more serious -- that he was not simply desirous of a little amusing talk , but starving , starving for a little human sympathy , a little brotherly love and comradeship ?  - -  that he was in an abnormally sensitive condition of mind , where mere negative unresponsiveness could hurt him like a slight or a rebuff ? In the course of the week I ran over to Pau , to pass a day with the Winchfields , who had a villa there . When I came back I brought with me all that they ( who knew everybody ) could tell about Sir Richard Maistre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shy men . He avoided general society , frightened away perhaps by the British Mamma , and spent a good part of each year abroad , wandering rather listlessly from town to town . Though young and rich , he was neither fast nor ambitious : the Members ' entrance to the House of Commons , the stage-doors of the music halls , were equally without glamour for him ; and if he was a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lieutenant , he had become so through the tacit operation of his stake in the country . He had chambers in St. James 's Street , was a member of the Travellers Club , and played the violin -- for an amateur rather well . His brother , Mortimer Maistre , was in diplomacy -- at Rio Janeiro or somewhere . His sister had married an Australian , and lived in Melbourne . At the Hotel d'Angleterre I found his shyness was mistaken for indifference . He was civil to everybody , but intimate with none . He attached himself to no party , paired off with no individuals . He sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out of their way to seek him , came back , as they felt , repulsed . He had been polite , but languid . These , however , were not the sort of persons he would be likely to care for . There prevailed a general conception of him as cold , unsociable . He certainly walked about a good deal alone -- you met him on the sands , on the cliffs , in the stiff little streets , rambling aimlessly , seldom with a companion . But to me it was patent that he played the solitary from necessity , not from choice -- from the necessity of his temperament . A companion was precisely that which above all things his heart coveted ; only he did n't know how to set about annexing one . If he sought nobody , it was because he did n't know how . This was a part of what his eyes said ; they bespoke his desire , his perplexity , his lack of nerve . Of the people who put themselves out to seek him , there was Miss Hicks ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother , son , and two redoubtable daughters , who drank champagne with every meal , dressed in the height of fashion , said their say at the tops of their voices , and were understood to be auctioneers ; a family from Bayswater named Krausskopf . I was among those whom he had marked as men he would like to fraternise with . As often as our paths crossed , his eyes told me that he longed to stop and speak , and continue the promenade abreast . I was under the control of a demon of mischief ; I took a malicious pleasure in eluding and baffling him -- in passing on with a nod . It had become a kind of game ; I was curious to see whether he would ever develop sufficient hardihood to take the bull by the horns . After all , from a conventional point of view , my conduct was quite justifiable . I always meant to do better by him next time , and then I always deferred it to the next . But , from a conventional point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself when I had momentary qualms of conscience . Now , rather late in the day , it strikes me that the conventional point of view should have been re-adjusted to the special case . I should have allowed for his personal equation . My cousin Wilford came to Biarritz about this time , stopping for a week , on his way home from a tour in Spain . I could n't find a room for him at the Hotel d'Angleterre , so he put up at a rival hostelry over the way ; but he dined with me on the evening of his arrival , a place being made for him between mine and Monsieur 's . He had n't been at the table five minutes before the rumour went abroad who he was -- somebody had recognised him . Then those who were within reach of his voice listened with all their ears -- Colonel Escott , Flaherty , Maistre , and Miss Hicks , of course , who even called him by name : ' Oh , Mr. Wilford , ' ' Now , Mr. Wilford , ' &c.; After dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; men with whom I had no acquaintance came merrily up and asked to be introduced . Colonel Escott and Flaherty joined us . At the outskirts of the group I beheld Sir Richard Maistre . His eyes ( without his realising it perhaps ) begged me to invite him , to present him ; and I affected not to understand ! This is one of the little things I find hardest to forgive myself . My whole behaviour towards the young man is now a subject of self-reproach ; if it had been different , who knows that the tragedy of yesterday would ever have happened ? If I had answered his timid overtures , walked with him , talked with him , cultivated his friendship , given him mine , established a kindly human relation with him , I ca n't help feeling that he might not have got to such a desperate pass , that I might have cheered him , helped him , saved him . I feel it especially when I think of Wilford . His eyes attested so much ; he would have enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of the man , had loved him through his books , like so many others . If I had introduced him ? If we had taken him with us the next morning on our excursion to Cambo ? Included him occasionally in our smokes and parleys ? Wilford left for England without dining again at the Hotel d'Angleterre . We were busy ' doing ' the country , and never chanced to be at Biarritz at the dinner hour . During that week I scarcely saw Sir Richard Maistre . Another little circumstance that rankles especially now would have been ridiculous except for the way things have ended . It is n't easy to tell -- it was so petty and I am so ashamed . Colonel Escott had been abusing London , describing it as the least beautiful of the capitals of Europe , comparing it unfavorably to Paris , Vienna , and St. Petersburg . I took up the cudgels in its defence , mentioned its atmosphere , its tone ; Paris Vienna , St. Petersburg were lyric , London was epic ; and so forth and so forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I argued that of all great towns it was the healthiest , its death-rate was lowest . Sir Richard Maistre had followed my dissertation attentively , and with a countenance that signified approval ; and when , with my reference to the death-rate , I paused , he suddenly burned his ships . He looked me full in the eye , and said , ' Thirty-seven , I believe ? ' His heightened colour , a nervous movement of the lip , betrayed the effort it had cost him ; but at last he had done it -- screwed his courage to the sticking-place , and spoken . And I -- I can never forget it -- I grow hot when I think of it -- but I was possessed by a devil . His eyes hung on my face , awaiting my response , pleading for a cue . ' Go , on , ' they urged . ' I have taken the first , the difficult step -- make the next smoother for me . ' And I -- I answered lackadaisically with just a casual glance at him , ' I do n't know the figures , ' and absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place was filled by a stranger , and Flaherty told me that he had left for the Riviera . All this happened last March at Biarritz . I never saw him again till three weeks ago . It was one of those frightfully hot afternoons in July ; I had come out of my club , and was walking up St. James 's Street , towards Piccadilly ; he was moving in an opposite sense ; and thus we approached each other . He did n't see me , however , till we had drawn rather near to a conjunction : then he gave a little start of recognition , his eyes brightened , his pace slackened , his right hand prepared to advance itself -- and I bowed slightly , and pursued my way . Do n't ask why I did it . It is enough to confess it without having to explain it . I glanced backwards , by and by , over my shoulder . He was standing where I had met him , half turned round , and looking after me . But when he saw that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued his descent of the street . That was only three weeks ago . Only three weeks ago I still had it in my power to act . I am sure -- I do n't know why I am sure , but I am sure -- that I could have deterred him . For all that one can gather from the brief note he left behind , it seems he had no special , definite motive ; he had met with no losses , got into no scrape ; he was simply tired and sick of life and of himself . ' I have no friends , ' he wrote . ' Nobody will care . People do n't like me ; people avoid me . I have wondered why ; I have tried to watch myself and discover ; I have tried to be decent . I suppose it must be that I emit a repellent fluid ; I suppose I am a " bad sort . " ' He had a morbid notion that people did n't like him , that people avoided him ! Oh , to be sure , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough : but he understood what it was that attracted them . Other people , the people he could have liked , kept their distance -- were civil , indeed , but reserved . He wanted bread , and they gave him a stone . It never struck him , I suppose , that they attributed the reserve to him . But I -- I knew that his reserve was only an effect of his shyness ; I knew that he wanted bread : and that knowledge constituted my moral responsibility . I did n't know that his need was extreme ; but I have tried in vain to absolve myself with the reflection . I ought to have made inquiries . When I think of that afternoon in St. James 's Street -- only three weeks ago -- I feel like an assassin . The vision of him , as he stopped and looked after me -- I ca n't banish it . Why did n't some good spirit move me to turn back and overtake him ? It is so hard for the mind to reconcile itself to the irretrievable . I ca n't shake off a sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that it is too late . CASTLES NEAR SPAIN I. That he should not have guessed it from the beginning seems odd , if you like , until one stops to consider the matter twice ; then , I think , one sees that after all there was no shadow of a reason why he should have done so , one sees , indeed , that even had a suspicion of the truth at any time crossed his mind , he would have had the best of reasons for scouting it as nonsense . It is obvious to us from the first word , because we know instinctively that otherwise there would be no story ; it is that which knits a mere sequence of incidents into a coherent , communicable whole . But , to his perceptions , the thing never presented itself as a story at all . It was n't an anecdote which somebody had buttonholed him to tell ; it was an adventure in which he found himself launched , an experience to be enjoyed bit by bit , as it befell , but in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint had he received from which to infer the identity of the two women ? On the contrary , were n't the actions of the one totally inconsistent with what everybody assured him was the manner of life -- with what the necessities of the case led him to believe would be the condition of spirit -- of the other ? If the tale were to be published , the fun would lie , not in attempting to mystify the reader , but in watching with him the mystification of the hero ,  - -  in showing how he played at hoodman-blind with his destiny , and how surprised he was , when , the bandage stripped from his eyes , he saw whom he had caught . II . On that first morning ,  - -  the first after his arrival at Saint-Graal , and the first , also , of the many on which they encountered each other in the forest ,  - -  he was bent upon a sentimental pilgrimage to Granjolaye . He was partly obeying , partly seeking , an emotion . His mind , inevitably , was full of old memories ; the melancholy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inclined to nurse . To revisit the scene of their boy-and-girl romance , would itself be romantic . In a little while he would come to the park gates , and could look up the long , straight avenue to the chateau ,  - -  there where , when they were children , twenty years ago , he and she had played so earnestly at being married , burning for each other with one of those strange , inarticulate passions that almost every childhood knows ; and where now , worse than widowed , she withheld herself , in silent , mysterious , tragical seclusion . And then he heard the rhythm of a horse 's hoofs ; and looking forward , down the green pathway , between the two walls of forest , he saw a lady cantering towards him . In an instant she had passed ; and it took a little while for the blur of black and white that she had flashed upon his retina to clear into an image -- which even then , from under-exposure , was obscure and piecemeal : a black riding-habit , of some flexile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and folds ; a small black hat , a toque , set upon a loosely-fastened mass of black hair ; a face intensely white -- a softly-rounded face , but intensely white ; soft full lips , singularly scarlet ; and large eyes , very dark . It was not much , certainly , but it persisted . The impression , defective as I give it , had been pleasing ; an impression of warm femininity , of graceful motion . It had had the quality , besides , of the unexpected and the fugitive , and the advantage of a sylvan background . Anyhow , it pursued him . He went on to his journey 's end ; stopped before the great gilded grille , with its multiplicity of scrolls and flourishes , its coronets and interlaced initials ; gazed up the shadowy aisle of plane-trees to the bit of castle gleaming in the sun at the end ; remembered the child Helene , and how he and she had loved each other there , a hundred years ago ; and thought of the exiled , worse than widowed woman immured there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was mere cerebration . The emotion he had looked for did not come . An essential part of him was elsewhere ,  - -  following the pale lady in the black riding-habit , trying to get a clearer vision of her face , blaming him for his inattention when she had been palpable before him , wondering who she was . ' If she should prove to be a neighbour , I sha n't bore myself so dreadfully down here after all , ' he thought . ' I wonder if I shall meet her again as I go home . ' She would very likely be returning the way she had gone . But , though he loitered , he did not meet her again . He met nobody . It was , in some measure , the attraction of that lonely forest lane , that one almost never did meet anybody in it . III . At Saint-Graal Andre was waiting to lunch with him . ' When we were children , ' Paul wrote in a letter to Mrs Winchfield , ' Andre , our gardener 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the only companion of my sex and age the neighbourhood afforded . But now , after a separation of twenty years , Andre , who has become our cure , insists upon treating me with distance . He wo n't waive the fact that I am the lord of the manor , and calls me relentlessly Monsieur . I 've done everything to entice him to unbend , but his backbone is of granite . From the merriest of mischief-loving youngsters , he has hardened into the solemnest of square-toes , with such a long upper-lip , and manners as stiff as the stuff of his awful best cassock , which he always buckles on prior to paying me a visit . Whatever is a poor young man to do ? At our first meeting , after my arrival , I fell upon his neck , and thee-and-thou 'd him , as of old time ; he repulsed me with a vous italicised . At last I demanded reason . " Why will you treat me with this inexorable respect ? What have I done to deserve it ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramoisi ( in the traditional phrase ) and stared.  - -  This is what it is to come back to the home of your infancy . ' Andre , in his awful best cassock , was waiting on the terrace . It was on the terrace that Paul had ordered luncheon to be served . The terrace at Saint-Graal is a very jolly place . It stretches the whole length of the southern facade of the house , and is generously broad . It is paved with great lozenge-shaped slabs of marble , stained in delicate pinks and greys with lichens ; and a marble balustrade borders it , overgrown , the columns half uprooted and twisted from the perpendicular , by an aged wistaria-vine , with a trunk as stout as a tree 's . Seated there , one can look off over miles of richly-timbered country , dotted with white-walled villages , and traversed by the Nive and the Adour , to the wry masses of the Pyrenees , purple curtains hiding Spain . Here , under an awning , the table was set , gay with white linen and glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red and yellow wine . The wistaria was in blossom , a world of colour and fragrance , shaken at odd moments by the swift dartings of innumerable lizards . The sun shone hot and clear ; the still air , as you touched it , felt like velvet . ' Oh , what a heavenly place , what a heavenly day , ' cried Paul ; ' it only needs a woman . ' And then , meeting Andre 's eye , he caught himself up , with a gesture of contrition . ' I beg a thousand pardons . I forgot your cloth . If you , ' he added , ' would only forget it too , what larks we might have together . Allons , a table . ' And they sat down . If Paul had sincerely wished to forfeit Andre 's respect , he could scarcely have employed more efficacious means to do so , than his speech and conduct throughout the meal that followed . You know how flippant , how ' fly-away , ' he can be when the mood seizes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really behaved outrageously ; and , since the priest maintained a straight countenance , I think the wonder is that he did n't excommunicate him . ' I remember you were a teetotaller , Andre , when you were young , ' his host began , pushing a decanter towards him . ' That , monsieur , was because my mother wished it , and my father was a drunkard , ' Andre answered bluntly . ' Since my father 's death , I have taken wine in moderation . ' He filled his glass . ' I remember once I cooked some chestnuts over a spirit-stove , and you refused to touch them , on the ground that they were alcoholic . ' ' That would have been from a confusion of thought , ' the cure explained , with never a smile . But it was better to err on the side of scrupulosity than on that of self-indulgence . ' ' Ah , that depends . That depends on whether the pleasure you got from your renunciation equalled that you might have got from the chestnuts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I 'm not denying I 'm a Pagan -- in my amateurish way . Let me give you some asparagus . Do you think a man can be saved who smokes cigarettes between the courses ? ' ' Saved ? ' questioned Andre . ' What have cigarettes to do with a man 's salvation ? ' ' It 's a habit I learned in Russia . I feared it might relate itself in some way to the Schism . ' And he lit a cigarette . ' I 'm always a rigid Catholic when I 'm in France . ' ' And when you 're in England ? ' ' Oh , one goes in for local colour , for picturesqueness , do n't you know . The Church of England 's charmingly overgrown with ivy . And besides , they 're going to disestablish it . One must make the most of it while it lasts . Tell me -- why can you never get decent brioches except in Catholic countries ? ' ' Is that a fact ? ' ' I swear it . ' ' It 's very singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many odd things a fellow learns from travel.  - -  Hush ! Wait a moment . ' He rose hastily , and made a dash with his hand at the tail of a lizard , that was hanging temptingly out from a bunch of wistaria leaves . But the lizard was too quick for him . With a whisk , it had disappeared . He sank back into his chair , sighing . ' It 's always like that . They 'll never keep still long enough to let me catch them . What 's the use of a university education and a cosmopolitan culture , if you ca n't catch lizards ? Do you think they have eyes in the backs of their heads ? ' Andre stared . ' Oh , I see . You think I 'm frivolous , ' Paul said plaintively . ' But you ought to have seen me an hour or two ago . ' Andre 's eyes asked , ' Why ? ' ' Oh , I was plunged in all the most appropriate emotions -- shedding floods of tears over my lost childhood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good cry now and then ? Oh , I do n't mean literal tears , of course ; only spiritual ones . For the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life . I walked over to Granjolaye . ' Andre looked surprise . ' To Granjolaye ? Have you -- were you --  ' He hesitated , but Paul understood . ' Have you heard from her ? Were you invited ? ' ' Oh , dear , no , ' he answered . ' No such luck . Not to the Chateau , only to the gates -- the East Gate . ' ( The principal entrance to the home park of Granjolaye is the South Gate , which opens upon the Route Departementale . ) ' I stood respectfully outside , and looked through the grating of the grille . I walked through the forest , by the Sentier des Contrebandiers . ' ' Ah , ' said Andre . ' And on my way what do you suppose I met ? ' ' A -- a viper , ' responded Andre . ' The hot weather is bringing them out . I killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cruel thing ! What did you want to kill the poor young creatures for ? And then to boast of it !  - -  But no , not a viper . A lady . ' ' A lady ? ' ' Yes -- a real lady ; she wore gloves . She was riding . I hope you wo n't think I 'm asking impertinent questions , but I wonder if you can tell me who she is . ' ' A lady riding in the Sentier des Contrebandiers ? ' Andre repeated incredulously . ' She looked like one . Of course I may have been deceived . I did n't hear her speak . Do you think she was a cook ? ' ' I did n't know any one ever rode in the Sentier des Contrebandiers . ' ' Oh , for that , I give you my word of honour . A lady -- or say a female -- in a black riding-habit ; dark hair and eyes ; very pale , with red lips and things . Oh , I 'm not trying to impose upon you . It was about half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' You might stop in the Sentier des Contrebandiers from January to December and not meet a soul , ' said Andre . ' Ah , I see . There 's no convincing you . Sceptic ! And yet , twenty years ago , you 'd have been pretty sure to meet a certain couple of small boys there , would n't you ? ' ' Si fait , ' assented Andre . ' We went there a good deal . But we were privileged . The only boys in this country now are peasants ' children , and they have no leisure for wandering in the wood . When they 're not at school , they 're working in the fields . As for their elders , the path is rough and circuitous ; the high road 's smoother and shorter , no matter where you 're bound . Since our time , I doubt if twenty people have passed that way . ' ' That argues ill for people 's taste . The place is lovely . Underfoot , it 's quite overgrown with mosses ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you get adorable effects of light and shadow . It 's fearfully romantic ; perfect for making love in , and that sort of thing . Oh , if all the women hereabouts had n't such hawk-like noses ! You see , the Duke of Wellington was here in 1814.  - -  No ? He was n't ? I thought I 'd read he was.  - -  Ah , well , he was just over the border . But my lady of this morning had n't a hawk-like nose . I ca n't quite remember what style of nose she did have , but it was n't hawk-like . I say , frankly , as between old friends , have you any notion who she was ? ' ' What kind of horse had she ? ' ' Ah , there ! ' cried Paul , with a despairing gesture . ' You 've touched my vulnerable point . I never shall have any memory for horses . I think it was black -- no , brown -- no , grey -- no , green . Oh , what am I saying ? I ca n't remember . Do -- do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been from Bayonne . ' ' Who rides from Bayonne ? Fancy a Bayonnaise on a horse ! They 're all busy in their shops . ' ' You forget the military . She may have been the wife of an officer . ' ' Oh , horror ! Do you really think so ? Then she must have been frowsy and provincial , after all ; and I thought her so smart and distinguished-looking and everything . ' ' Or perhaps an Englishwoman from Biarritz . They sometimes ride out as far as this . ' ' Dear Andre , if she were English , I should have known it at a glance -- and there the matter would have rested . I have at least a practised eye for English women . I have n't lived half my life in England without learning something . ' ' Well , there are none but English at Biarritz at this season . ' ' She was never English . Do n't try to bully me . Besides , she evidently knew the country . Otherwise , how could she have found the Sentier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' There 's no one at Granjolaye save the Queen herself . ' ' Deceiver ! Manuela told me last night . She has her little Court , her maids-of-honour . I think my inconnue looked like a maid-of-honour . ' ' She has her aunt , old Mademoiselle Henriette , and a couple of German women , countesses or baronesses or something , with unpronounceable names . ' ' I ca n't believe she 's German . Still , I suppose there are some Christian Germans . Perhaps .... ' ' They 're both middle-aged . Past fifty , I should think . ' ' Oh.  - -  Ah , well , that disposes of them . But how do you know her Majesty has n't a friend , a guest , staying with her ? ' ' It 's possible , but most unlikely , seeing the close retirement in which she lives . She 's never once gone beyond her garden , since she came back there , three , four , years ago ; nor received any visitors . Personne -- not the Bishop of Bayonne nor the Sous-Prefet , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a matter of civility . She has her private chaplain . If a guest had arrived at Granjolaye , the whole country would know it and talk of it . ' ' Oh , I see what you 're trying to insinuate , ' cried Paul . ' You 're trying to insinuate that she came from Chateau Yroulte . ' That was the next nearest country-house . ' Nothing of the sort , ' said Andre . ' Chateau Yroulte has been shut up and uninhabited these two years -- ever since the death of old Monsieur Raoul . It was bought by a Spanish Jew ; but he 's never lived in it and never let it . ' ' Well , then , where did she come from ? Not out of the Fourth Dimension ? Who was she ? Not a wraith , an apparition ? Why will you entertain such weird conjectures ? ' ' She must have come from Bayonne . An officer 's wife , beyond a doubt . ' ' Oh , you 're perfectly remorseless , ' sighed Paul , and changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives , in garrison-towns like Bayonne , had , in his experience , always been , as he expressed it , frowsy and provincial . IV . One would think , by this time , the priest , poor man , had earned a moment of mental rest ; but Paul 's thirst for knowledge was insatiable . He began to ply him with questions about the Queen . And though Andre could tell him very little , and though he had heard all that the night before from Manuela , it interested him curiously to hear it repeated . It amounted to scarcely more than a single meagre fact . A few months after the divorce , she had returned to Granjolaye , and she had never once been known to set her foot beyond the limits of her garden from that day to this . She had arrived at night , attended by her two German ladies-in-waiting . A carriage had met her at the railway station in Bayonne , and set her down at the doors of her Chateau , where her aunt , old Mademoiselle Henriette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody had the poorest means of discovering . Her own servants ( tongue-tied by fear or love ) could not be got to speak ; and from the eyes of all outsiders she was sedulously screened . Paul could imagine her , in her great humiliation , solitary among the ruins of her high destiny , hiding her wounds ; too sensitive to face the curiosity , too proud to brook the pity , of the world . She seemed to him a very grandiose and tragic figure , and he lost himself musing of her -- her with whom he had played at being married , when they were children here , so long , so long ago . She was the daughter , the only child and heiress , of the last Duc de la Granjolaye de Ravanches ,  - -  the same nobleman of whom it was told that when Louis Napoleon , meaning to be gracious , said to him , ' You bear a great name , Monsieur , ' he had answered sweetly , ' The greatest of all , I think . ' It is certain he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the noblesse of Europe , descended directly and legitimately , through the Bourbons , from Saint Louis of France ; and , to boot , he was immensely rich , owning ( it was said ) half the iron mines in the north of Spain , as well as a great part of the city of Bayonne . Paul 's grandmother , the Comtesse de Louvance , was his next neighbour . Paul remembered him vaguely as a tall , drab , mild-mannered man , with a receding chin , and a soft , rather piping voice , who used to tip him , and have him over a good deal to stay at Granjolaye . On the death of Madame de Louvance , the property of Saint-Graal had passed to her son , Edmond ,  - -  Andre 's feu Monsieur le Comte . Edmond rarely lived there , and never asked his sister or her boy there ; whence , twenty years ago , at the respective ages of thirteen and eleven , Paul and Helene had vanished from each other 's ken . But Edmond never married , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left a will making Paul his heir . Of Helene 's later history Paul knew as much as all the world knows , and no more -- so much , that is , as one could gather from newspapers and public rumour . He knew of her father 's death , whereby she had become absolute mistress of his enormous fortune . He knew of her princely marriage , and of her elevation by the old king to her husband 's rank of Royal Highness . He knew of that swift series of improbable deaths which had culminated in her husband 's accession to the throne , and how she had been crowned Queen-Consort . And then he knew that three or four years afterwards she had sued for and obtained a Bull of Separation from the Pope , on the plea of her husband 's infidelity and cruelty . The infidelity , to be sure , was no more than , as a Royalty , if not as a woman , she might have bargained for and borne with ; but everybody remembers the stories of the king 's drunken violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , too , how , the Papal Separation once pronounced , he had retaliated upon her with a decree of absolute divorce , and a sentence of perpetual banishment , voted by his own parliament . Whither she had betaken herself after these troubles Paul had never heard -- until , yesterday , arriving at Saint-Graal , they told him she was living cloistered like a nun at Granjolaye . News travels fast and penetrates everywhere in that lost corner of garrulous Gascony . The news that Paul had taken up his residence at Saint-Graal could scarcely fail to reach the Queen . Would she remember their childish intimacy ? Would she make him a sign ? Would she let him see her , for old sake 's sake ? Oh , in all probability , no . Most certainly , no . And yet -- and yet , he could n't forbid a little furtive hope to flicker in his heart . V. It was only April , but the sun shone with midsummer strength . After Andre left him , he went down into the garden . From a little distance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-colour , painted in grey and amber on a field of luminous blue . If he had wished it , he could have bathed himself in flowers ; hyacinths , crocuses , jonquils , camellias , roses , grew round him everywhere , sending up a symphony of warm odours ; further on , in the grass , violets , anemones , celandine ; further still , by the margins of the pond , narcissuses , and tall white flowers-de-luce ; and , in the shrubberies , satiny azaleas ; and overhead , the magnolia trees , drooping with their freight of ivory cups . The glass doors of the orangery stood open , a cloud of sweetness hanging heavily before them . In the park , the chestnuts were in full leaf ; and surely a thousand birds were twittering and piping amongst their branches . ' Oh , bother ! How it cries out for a woman , ' said Paul . ' It 's such a waste of good material ' The beauty went to one 's head . One craved a sympathetic companion to share it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enkindled . ' If I do n't look out I shall become sentimental , ' the lone man told himself . ' Nature 's so fearfully lacking in tact . Fancy her singing an epithalamium in a poor fellow 's ears , when he does n't know a single human woman nearer than Paris . ' To make matters worse , the day ended in a fiery sunset , and then there was a full moon ; and in the rosery a nightingale performed its sobbing serenade . ' Please go out and give that bird a penny , and tell him to go away , ' Paul said to a servant . It was all very well to jest , but at every second breath he sighed profoundly . I 'm afraid he had become sentimental . It seemed a serious pity that what his heart was full of should spend itself on the incapable air . His sense of humour was benumbed . And when , presently , the frogs in the pond , a hundred yards away , set up their monotonous plaintive concert , he laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in for it , ' he confessed . After all , he was out of England . He was in Gascony , the borderland between amorous France and old romantic Spain . I do n't know whom his imagination dwelt the more fondly with : the stricken Queen , beyond there , alone in the darkness and the silence , where the night lay on the forest of Granjolaye ; or the pale horse-woman of the morning . But surely , as yet , he had no ghost of a reason for dreaming that the two were one and the same . VI . ' Now , let 's be logical , ' he said next morning . ' Let 's be logical and hopeful -- yet not too hopeful , not utopian . Let 's look the matter courageously in the face . Since she rode there once , why may she not ride again in the Sentier des Contrebandiers ? Why may n't she ride there often -- even daily ? I think that 's logical . Do n't you think that 's logical ? ' The person he addressed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a straight nose , and rather a ribald eye , was vigorously brushing a head of yellowish hair , in the looking-glass before him . ' Tush ! But of course you think so , ' Paul went on . ' You always think as I do . If you knew how I despise a sycophant ! And yet -- you 're not bad looking . No , I 'll be hanged if I can honestly say that you 're bad looking . You 've got nice hair , and plenty of it ; and there 's a weakness about your mouth and chin that goes to my heart . I hate firm people.  - -  What ? So do you ? I thought so.  - -  Ah , well , my poor friend , you 're booked for a shocking long walk this morning . You must summon your utmost fortitude.  - -  Under the greenwood tree , who loves to lie with me ? ' he carolled forth , to Marzials 's tune . ' But come ! I say ! That 's anticipating . ' And he set forth for the Smugglers ' Pathway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she passed him , her eyes met his : at which he was conscious of a good deal of interior commotion . ' By Jove , she 's magnificent , she 's really stunning , ' he exclaimed to himself . He perceived that she was rather a big woman , tall , with finely-rounded , smoothly-flowing lines . Her hair ,  - -  velvety blue-black in its shadows ,  - -  where the light caught it was dully iridescent . Her features were irregular enough to give her face a high degree of individuality , yet by no means to deprive it of delicacy or attractiveness . She had a superb white throat , and a soft voluptuous chin ; and ' As I live , I never saw such a mouth , ' said Paul . Where did she come from ? Bayonne ? Never . Andre might have been mistaken about Chateau Yroulte ; the Spanish Jew had perhaps sold it , or found a tenant . Or , further afield , there were Chateaux Labenne , Saumuse , d'Orthevielle . Or else , the Queen had a guest . ' Anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' that makes five , six miles that you have tramped , to enjoy an instant 's glimpse of her . Fortunately they say walking is good for the constitution . It only shows what extremities a country life may drive one to . ' The next day , not only did her eyes meet his , but he could have sworn that she almost smiled . Oh , a very furtive smile , the mere transitory suggestion of a smile . But the inner commotion was more marked . The next day ( the fourth ) she undoubtedly did smile , and slightly inclined her head . He removed his hat , and went home , and waited impatiently for twenty-four hours to wear away . ' She smiled -- she bowed , ' he kept repeating . But , alas , he could n't forget that in that remote countryside it is very much the fashion for people who meet in the roads and lanes to bow as they pass . On the fifth , sixth , seventh , and eighth days she bowed and smiled . ' I fairly wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Paul . ' To-morrow I 'm going to speak . Faut brusquer les choses . ' And he penetrated into the forest , firmly determined to speak . ' Only I ca n't seem to think of anything very pat to say , ' he sighed . ' Hello ! She 's off her horse . ' She was off her horse , standing beside it , holding the loose end of a strap in her hand . Providence was favouring him . Here was his obvious chance . Something was wrong . He could offer his assistance . And yet , that inner commotion was so violent , he felt a little bewildered about the mot juste . He approached her gradually , trying to compose himself and collect his wits . She looked up , and said in French ' I beg your pardon . Something has come undone . Can you help me ? ' Her voice was delicious , cool and smooth as ivory . His heart pounded . He vaguely bowed , and murmured , ' I should be delighted . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He bent over the strap that was loose , and bit his lips , and cursed his embarrassments . ' Come , I must n't let her think me quite an ass . ' He was astonished at himself . That he should still be capable of so strenuous a sensation ! ' And I had thought I was blase ! ' He was intensely conscious of the silence , of the solitude and dimness of the forest , and of their isolation there , so near to each other , that superb pale woman and himself . But his eyes were bent on the misbehaving strap , which he held helplessly between his fingers . At last he looked up at her . ' How warm and beautiful and fragrant she is , ' he thought . ' With her white face , with her dark eyes , with those red lips and that splendid figure -- what an heroic looking woman ! ' ' This is altogether disgraceful , ' he said , ' and I assure you I 'm covered with confusion . But I wo n't dissemble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . I 'm afraid this is the first time in my life I have ever touched anything belonging to a horse . ' He said it with a pathetic drawl , and she laughed.  - -  'And yet you 're English . ' ' Oh , I dare say I 'm English enough . Though I do n't see how you knew it . Do n't tell me you knew it from my accent . ' ' Oh , non pas , ' she hastened to protest . ' But you 're the new owner of Saint-Graal . Everybody of the country knows , of course , that the new owner of Saint-Graal , Mr. Warringwood , is English . ' ' Ah , then she 's of the country , ' was Paul 's mental note . ' And I thought all Englishmen were horsemen , ' she went on . ' Oh , there are a few bright exceptions -- there 's a little scattered remnant . It 's the study of my life to avoid being typical . ' ' Ah , well , then give me the strap . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eye she had snapped the necessary buckle . Then she looked up at him and smiled oddly . It occurred to him that the entire comedy of the strap had perhaps been invented as an excuse for opening a conversation ; and he was at once flattered and disappointed . ' Oh , if she 's that sort ... ' he thought . ' I 'm heart-broken not to have been able to serve you , ' he said . ' You can help me to mount , ' she answered . And , before he quite knew how it was done , he had helped her to mount , and she was galloping down the path . The firm grasp of her warm gloved hand on his shoulder accompanied him to Saint-Graal . ' It 's amazing how she sticks in my mind , ' he said . He really could n't fix his attention on any other subject . ' I wonder who the deuce she is . She 's giving me my money 's worth in walking . That business of the strap was really brazen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one desires the end . I hope she is n't that sort . ' VII . On the tenth , eleventh , and twelfth days , she passed him with a bow and a good-morning . ' This is too much ! ' he groaned , in the silence of his chamber . ' She 's doing it with malice . I 'll not be trifled with . I -- I 'll do something desperate . I 'll pretend to faint , and she 'll have to get down and bandage up my wounds . ' On the thirteenth day , as they met , she stopped her horse . ' You 're at least typically English in one respect , ' she said . ' Oh , unkind lady ! To announce it to me in this sudden way . Then my life 's a failure . ' ' I mean in your fondness for long walks . ' ' Ah , then you 're totally in error . I hate long walks . ' ' But it 's a good ten kilometres to and from your house ; and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there are n't any omnibuses or cabs or things . And ' ( he reminded himself that if she was that sort , he might be bold ) ' I 'm irresistibly attracted here . ' ' It 's very pretty , ' she admitted , and rode on . He looked after her , grinding his teeth . Was she that sort ? ' One never can tell . Her face is so fine -- so noble even . ' The next day , ' Yes , I suppose it 's very pretty . But I was n't thinking of Nature , ' he informed her , as she approached . She drew up . ' Oh , it has its human interest too , no doubt . ' She glanced in the direction of the Chateau of Granjolaye . ' The Queen , ' said he . ' But one never sees her . ' ' That adds the charm of mystery , do n't you feel ? To think of that poor young exiled woman , after so grand a beginning , ending so desolately -- shut up alone in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Then you 're not of her Court ? ' ' I ? Of her Court ? Mais quelle idee ! ' ' It was only a hypothesis . Of course , you know I 'm devoured by curiosity . My days are spent in wondering who you are . ' She laughed . ' You must have a care , or you 'll be typical , ' she warned him . ' I never said I was n't human , ' he called after her , as she cantered away . VIII . The next day still ( the fifteenth ) , ' Have n't I heard you lived at Saint-Graal when you were a child ? ' she asked . ' If you have , for once in a way rumour has told the truth . I lived at Saint-Graal till I was thirteen . ' ' Then perhaps you knew her ? ' ' Her ? ' ' The Queen . Mademoiselle de la Granjolaye de Ravanches . ' ' Oh , I knew her very well -- when we were children . ' ' Tell me all about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She leaped from her horse ; then , raising her riding whip , and looking the animal severely in the eye , ' Bezigue ! Attention , ' she said impressively . ' You 're to stop exactly where you are and not play any tricks . Entendu ? Bien . ' She moved a few steps down the pathway , and stopped at an opening among the trees , where the ground was a cushion of bright green moss . ' By Jove , she is at her ease , ' thought Paul , who followed her . ' How splendidly she walks -- what undulations ! ' From the French point of view , as she must be aware , the situation gave him all sorts of rights . She sank softly , gracefully , upon the moss . ' It 's a long story . Tell it me , ' she commanded , and pointed to the earth . He sat down facing her , at a little distance . ' It 's odd you should have chosen this place , ' said he . ' Odd ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment their eyes held each other ; and all at once the blood swept through him with suffocating violence . She was so beautiful , so sumptuous , so warmly and richly feminine ; and surely the circumstances were not anodyne . Her softly rounded face , its very pallor , the curve and colour of her lips , her luminous dark eyes , the smooth modulations of her voice , and then her loose abundance of black hair , and the swelling lines of her breast , the fluent contour of her waist and hips , under the fine black cloth of her dress -- all these , with the silence of the forest , the heat of the southern day , the woodland fragrances of which the air was full , and the sense of being intimately alone with her , set up within him a turbulent vibration , half of delight , half of pained suspense . And the complaisant informality with which she met him played a sustaining counterpoint . ' What luck , what luck , what luck , ' were the words which shaped themselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Whither would it lead ? He had savoured the bouquet , he was famished to taste the wine . And yet , so complicated are our human feelings , he was obscurely vexed . Only two kinds of woman , he would have maintained yesterday , could conceivably do a thing like this : an ingenue or ' that sort . ' She was n't an ingenue . Something , at the same time , half assured him that she was n't ' that sort , ' either . But -- the circumstances ! The situation ! ' Why odd ? ' she repeated . ' Oh , I do n't want to talk about the Queen , ' he said , in a smothered voice . ' The oddity relates itself to the Queen ? ' ' Oh , this is where we used to waste half our lives when we were children . That 's all . This was our favourite nook . ' ' Perfect then for the story you 're going to tell me . ' ' What story ? ' ' You said it was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . ' His eyes were fastened upon her hands , small and tapering , in their tan gauntlets . The point of a patent-leather boot glanced from the edge of her skirt . A short gold watch-chain dangled from her breast , a cluster of charms at the end . ' You said it was a long story , ' she repeated sternly . ' It would be a dull one . We knew each other when we were infants , and used to play together . That is all . ' ' But what was she like ? Describe her to me . I adore souvenirs d'enfance . ' Her eyes were bright with eagerness . ' Oh , she was very pretty . The prettiest little girl I 've ever seen . She had the most wonderful eyes -- deep , deep , into which you could look a hundred miles ; you know the sort ; dreamy , poetical , sad ; oh , lovely eyes . And she used to wear her hair down her back ; it was very long , and soft -- soft as smoke , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frocks , with broad sashes , red or blue . That was the fashion then for little girls . Perhaps it is still -- I 've never noticed . ' ' Yes . Do n't stop . Go on . ' ' Dear me , I do n't know what to say . I used to see her a good deal , because they were our neighbours . Her father used to ask me over to stay at Granjolaye . She needed a playmate , and I was the only one available . Sometimes she would come and spend a day at Saint-Graal . Do you know Granjolaye ? The castle ? It 's worth going over . It used to belong to the Kings of Navarre , you know . We used to play together in the great audience chamber , and chase each other through the secret passages in the walls . At Saint-Graal we confined ourselves to the garden . Her head was full of the queerest romantic notions . You could n't persuade her that the white irises that grew about our pond were n't enchanted princesses . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , and then she sprinkled them with it , pronouncing an incantation . " If ye were born as ye are , remain as ye are ; but if ye were born otherwise , resume your original shapes . " They remained as they were ; but that did n't shake her faith . Something was amiss with the holy water , or with the form of her incantation . ' She laughed softly . ' Then she was nice ? You liked her ? ' she asked . ' Oh , I was passionately in love with her . All children are passionately in love with somebody , are n't they ? A real grande passion . It began when I was about ten . ' He broke off , to laugh . ' Do you care for love stories ? I 'm a weary , wayworn man ; but upon my word , I 've never in all my life felt any such intense emotion for a woman , anything that so nearly deserved to be called love , as I felt for Helene de la Granjolaye when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie awake thinking how I loved her -- longing to tell her so -- planning how I would , next day -- composing tremendous declarations -- imagining her response -- and waiting in a fever of impatience for the day to come . But then , when I met her , I did n't dare . Bless me , how I used to thrill at sight of her , with love , with fear . How I used to look at her face , and pine to kiss her . If her hand touched mine , I almost fainted . It 's very strange that children before their teens should be able to experience the whole gamut of the spiritual side of love ; and yet it 's certain . ' She was looking at him with intent eyes , her lips parted a little . ' But you did tell her at last , I hope ? ' she said , anxiously . He had got warmed to his subject , and her interest inspired him . ' Oh , at last ! It was here -- in this very spot . I had picked a lot of celandine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like stars . Oh , the joy of being allowed to touch her hair ! It made utterance a necessity . I fumbled and stammered , and blushed and thrilled , and almost choked . And at last I blurted it out . " I love you so . I love you so . " That -- after the eloquent declarations I had composed overnight ! ' ' And she ? ' ' She answered quite simply , " Et moi , je t'aime tant , aussi . " And then she began to cry . And when I asked her what she was crying for , she explained that I ought n't to have left her in doubt for so long ; she had been so unhappy from fear that I did n't " love her so . " She was quite unfemininely frank , you see . Oh , the ecstacy of that hour ! The ecstacy of our first kiss ! From that time on it was " mon petit mari " and " ma petite femme . " The greatest joy in life for me , for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and repeating from time to time , " J ' t'aime tant , j ' t'aime tant . " Now and then we would vary it with a fugue upon our names --  " Helene ! "  --  " Paul ! " ' He laughed . ' Children , with their total lack of humour , are the drollest of created beings , are n't they ? ' ' Oh , I do n't think it 's droll . I know , all children have those desperate love affairs . But they seem to me pathetic . How did it go on ? ' ' Oh , for two or three years we lived in Paradise . There were no other boys in the neighbourhood , so she was constant . ' ' For three years ? And then ? ' ' Then my grandmother died , and I was carried off to Paris . She remained here . And so it ended . ' ' And when did you meet her next ? After you were grown up ? ' ' I have never met her since . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though ? ' ' Ah , quant a ca ! ' ' Her marriage , her coronation , her divorce . Poor Woman ! What she must have suffered . Have you made any attempt to see her since you came back to Saint-Graal ? ' ' Ah , merci , non ! If she wanted to see me , she 'd send for me . ' ' She sees no one , everybody says . But I should think she 'd like to see you -- her old playmate . If she should send for you -- But I suppose I mus n't ask you to tell me about it afterwards ? Of course , like everybody else in her neighbourhood , I 'm awfully interested in her . ' There was a moment 's silence . She looked at the moss beneath her , and stroked it lightly with a finger-tip . Paul looked at her . ' You 're horribly unkind , ' he said at last . ' Unkind ? ' She raised wide eyes of innocent surprise . ' You know I 'm in an agony of curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Me ? ' ' Yourself . ' She lifted the cluster of charms at the end of her watch-chain . One of them was a tiny golden whistle . On this she blew , and Bezigue came trotting up . She mounted him to-day without Paul 's assistance . Smiling down on the young man , she said , ' Oh , after the reckless way in which I 've cast the conventions to the winds , you really ca n't expect me to give you my name and address . ' And before he could answer , she was gone . He walked about for the rest of the day in a great state of excitement . ' My dear , ' he told himself , ' if you 're not careful , something serious will happen to you . ' IX . When he woke up he saw that it was raining ; and in that part of the world it really never does rain but it pours . Needless to touch upon the impatient ennui with which he roamed the house . He sent for Andre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do something to stop this rain ? ' he asked ; but Andre stared . ' Oh , I was thinking of the priests of Baal , ' Paul explained . ' I beg your pardon . ' And after the coffee , ' Let 's go up and play in the garret , ' he proposed : at which Andre stared harder still . ' We always used to play in the garret on rainy days , ' Paul reminded him . ' Mais , ma foi , monsieur , nous ne sommes plus des gosses , ' Andre answered . ' Is there any news about the Queen ? ' Paul asked . ' There 's never any news from Granjolaye , ' said Andre . ' And the lady I met in the forest ? Have you any new theory who she is ? ' ' An officer 's wife from Ba --  --  ' ' Andre ! ' cried Paul . ' If you say that again , I shall write to the Pope and ask him to disfrock you . ' The next day was fine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smuggler 's Pathway , he did not meet her . ' It 's because the ground 's still wet , ' he reasoned . ' Oh , why do n't things dry quicker ? ' The next day he did meet her -- and she passed him with a bow . He shook his fist at her unsuspecting back . The next day he perceived Bezigue riderless near the opening among the trees . The horse neighed , as he drew near . She was seated on the moss . He stood still , and bowed tentatively from the path . ' Are you disengaged ? May I come in ? ' he asked . ' Oh , do , ' she answered . ' And -- wo n't you take a seat ? ' ' Thank you , ' and he placed himself beside her . ' Tell me about your life afterwards , ' she said . ' My life afterwards ? After what ? ' ' After you were carried off to Paris . ' ' What earthly interest can that have ? ' ' I want to know . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is in average circumstances . ' ' You went to school ? ' ' What makes you doubt it ? Do I seem so illiterate ? ' ' Where ? In England ? Eton ? Harrow ? ' ' No , in Paris . The Lycee Louis le Grand . Oh , I have received an education -- no expense was spared . I forget how many years I passed a faire mon droit in the Latin Quarter . You 'd be surprised if you were to discover what a lot I know . Shall I prove to you that the sum of the angles of a right-angled triangle is equal to two right angles ? Or conjugate the verb amo ? Or give you a brief summary of the doctrines of Aristotle ? Or an account of the life and works of Gustavus Alolphus ? ' ' When did you go to England ? ' ' Not till Necessity drove me there . I had to eke out a meagre patrimony . I went to England to seek my fortune . ' ' Did you find it ? ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father used to send me into the library to fetch a book , or my mother into her dressing-room to fetch her scissors , I could never find them . I looked for it everywhere , but I could n't find it . ' ' What did you do ? ' ' I lived by my wits . Chevalier d'industrie . ' ' Ah , non . Je ne crois pas . ' ' You do n't believe my wits were sufficient to the task ? I was like the London hospitals -- practically unendowed ; only they would n't support me by voluntary contributions . So -- I wrote for the newspapers , I 'm afraid . ' ' For the newspapers ? ' ' Oh , I admit , it 's scandalous . But you may as well know the worst . A penny-a-liner ! But I sha n't do so any more , now that I have stepped into the shoes of my uncle . You 'll never catch me fatiguing myself with work , now that I 've got enough to live on ! ' ' Lazy ! ' ' Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you never married ? ' ' I do n't think so . ' ' Are n't you sure ? ' ' As sure as one can be of anything in this doubtful world . ' ' But why did n't you ? ' ' Pas si bete . Marriage is such a bore . I never met a woman I could bear the thought of passing all my life with . ' ' Conceited ! ' ' I daresay . If you like false modesty better , I 'll try to meet your wishes . What woman would have had a poor devil like me ? ' ' Still , marriage is , after all , very much in vogue . ' ' Yes , but it 's mad . Either you must love the woman you marry , or you must n't love her . But if you marry a woman without loving her , I hope you 'll not deny you 're doing a very shocking thing . If , on the contrary , you do love her , raison de plus for not marrying her Fancy marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , watching the beautiful wild flower of love fatten into a domestic cabbage ! Is n't that a syllogism ? ' ' You have been in love then ? ' ' Never . ' ' Never ? ' ' Oh , I 've made a fool of myself occasionally , of course . But I 've never been in love . ' ' Except with Helene de la Granjolaye ? ' ' Oh , yes , I was in love with her -- when I was ten . ' ' Till you were ... ? ' ' Till I was ... ? ' ' How long did it take you to get over it , I mean ? ' ' I do n't know . It wore away gradually . The tooth of time . ' ' You 're not at all in love with her any more ? ' ' After twenty years ? And she a Queen ? I hope I know my place . ' ' But if you were to meet her again ? ' ' I should probably suffer a horrible disillusion . ' ' But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is best " ? ' ' First and last . The last shall be first , ' he said oracularly . ' Do n't you smoke ? ' she asked . ' Oh , one by one you drag my vices from me . Let me own , en bloc , that I have them all . ' ' Then you may light a cigarette and give me one . ' He gave her a cigarette , and held a match while she lit it . Then he lit one for himself . Her manner of smoking was leisurely , luxurious . She inhaled the smoke , and let it escape slowly in a slender spiral . He looked at her through the thin cloud , and his heart closed in a convulsion . ' How big and soft and rich -- how magnificent she is -- like some great splendid flower , heavy with sweetness ! ' he thought . He had to breathe deep to overcome a feeling of suffocation ; he was trembling in every nerve , and he wondered if she perceived it . He divined the smooth perfection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he noticed vaguely that the dress she wore to-day was blue , not black . He divined the warmth of her round white throat , the perfume of her skin . ' And how those lips could kiss ! ' his imagination shouted wildly . Again , the silence , the solitude and dimness of the forest , their intimate seclusion there , the great trees , the sky , the bright green cushion of moss , the few detached sounds ,  - -  bird- notes , rustling leaves , snapping twigs ,  - -  by which the silence was intensified ; again all these lent an acuteness to his sensations . Her dark eyes were smiling lustrously , languidly , at the smoke curling in the air before her , as if they saw a vision in it . ' You 're adorable at moments , ' he said at last . ' At moments ! Thank you . ' She laughed . ' Oh , you ca n't expect me to pretend that I find you adorable always . There are times when I could fall upon you and exterminate you . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nod . ' ' T was your own fault . You did n't look amusing yesterday . ' ' When you baffle my perfectly innocent desire to know whom I have the honour of addressing . ' ' Shall I summon Bezigue ? ' she asked , touching her bunch of charms . He acted his despair . ' Besides , what does it matter ? I know who you are , ' she went on . ' Let that console you . ' ' Did I say you were adorable ? You 're hateful . ' ' What 's in a name ? Nothing but the power to compromise . Would you have me compromise myself more than I 've done already ? A woman who makes a man 's acquaintance without an introduction , and talks about love , and smokes cigarettes , with him ! ' She gave a little shudder . ' How horrible it sounds when you state it baldly . ' ' One must never state things baldly . One must qualify . It 's the difference between Truth and mere Fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman knew the man by common report to be of the highest possible respectability , and that she saw for herself he was ( alas ! ) altogether harmless . And then you must explain that the affair took place in the country , in the spring ; and that the cigarettes were the properest conceivable sort of cigarettes , having been rolled by hand in England . ' ' You would n't believe me if I said I had never done such a thing before ? They all say that , do n't they ? ' ' Yes , they all say that . But , oddly enough , I do believe you . ' ' Then you 're not entirely lost to grace , not thoroughly a cynic . ' ' Oh , there are some good women . ' ' And some good men ? ' ' Possibly . I 've never happened to meet one . ' ' The eye of the beholder ! ' ' If you like . But I do n't know . There are such things , no doubt , as cynics by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cry : The eye of the beholder . But others become cynics , are driven into cynicism , by sad experience . I started in life with the rosiest faith in my fellow-man . If I 've lost it , it 's because he 's always behaved shabbily to me , soon or late ; always taking some advantage . The struggle for existence ! We 're all beasts , who take part in it ; we must be , or we 're devoured . Women for the most part are out of it . Anyhow , plus je vois les hommes , plus j'aime les femmes . ' ' Are you a beast too ? ' ' Oh , yes . But I do n't bite . I 'm the kind of beast that runs away . I lie by the fire and purr , but at the first sign of trouble I jump for the open door . That 's why the other fellows always got the better of me . They knew I was a coward , and profited by the knowledge . If my dear good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have lived . ' ' I 'm afraid you have " lived " too much . ' ' That was uncalled for . ' ' Or else your looks belie you . ' ' My looks ? ' ' You 're so dissipated-looking . ' ' Dissipated-looking ? I ? Horror ! ' ' You 've got such a sophisticated eye , if that suits you better . You look blase . ' ' You 're a horrid , rude , uncomplimentary thing . ' ' Oh , if you 're going to call names , I must summon my natural protector . ' She blew on her golden whistle , and up trotted the obedient Bezigue . That evening Paul said to himself , ' I vastly fear that something serious has happened to you . No , she 's everything you like , but she is n't that sort . ' He was depressed , dejected ; the reaction , no doubt , from the excitement of her presence . ' She 's married , of course ; and of course she 's got a lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likes of me . And of course she sees what 's the matter with me , and is laughing in her sleeve . And I had thought myself impervious . Oh , damn all women . ' X. ' Do n't stop ; ride on , ' he called out to her , next morning , ' I sha n't be amusing to-day . I 'm frightfully low in my mind . ' ' Perhaps it will amuse me to study you in a new aspect , ' she said . ' You can entertain me with the story of your griefs . ' ' Bare my wounds to make a lady smile . Oh , anything to oblige you . ' She leapt lightly from Bezigue , and sank upon the moss . ' What is it all about ? ' ' Oh , not what you imagine , ' said he . ' It 's about my debts . ' ' I had hoped it was about your sins . ' ' My sins ! I 'm kept awake at night by the thought of yours . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peccadillos . ' ' You say that because you 've no sense of moral proportion . Are cruelty and dissimulation pecadillos ? ' ' They may be even virtues . It all depends . Discipline and reserve ! ' ' I 'll forgive you everything if you 'll tell me your name . ' ' Oh , I have debts , as well as you . ' ' What have debts to do with the question ? ' ' I owe something to my reputation . ' ' If we 're going to consider our reputations , what of mine ? ' ' Yours has preceded you into the country , ' she said , and drew from her pocket a small , thin volume , bound in grey cloth , with a gilt design . ' Oh , heavens ! ' cried Paul . ' This is how one 's past finds one out . ' ' Oh , some of them are n't bad , ' she said . ' Wait , I 'll read you one . ' ' Then you know English ? ' ' A leetle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' And then she read out , in an enchanting voice , one of his own French sonnets . ' That is n't bad , ' she added . ' Do you think it hopelessly bad ? ' ' It shows promise , perhaps -- when you read it . ' ' It is strange , though , that it should have been written by a man who had never been in love . ' ' Imagination ! Upon my word , I never had been . Besides , the idea is stolen . It 's almost a literal translation from Rossetti . What with a little imagination and a little ingenuity , one can do wonderfully well on other people 's experience . ' ' I do n't believe you . You have been in love a hundred times . ' ' Never . ' ' Never ? Not even with Helene de la Granjolaye de Ravanches ? ' ' Oh , I do n't count my infancy . Never with anybody else . ' ' It 's very strange , ' she said . ' Tell me some more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I suppose when they carried you off to Paris you had a tearful parting ? Did you kick and scream and say you would n't go ? ' ' Why do you always make me talk about the Queen ? ' ' She interests me . And when you talk about the Queen , I rather like you . It is nice to see that there was a time when you were capable of an emotion . ' ' You fancy I 'm incapable now ? ' ' Tell me about your leave-taking , your farewells . ' ' Bother our farewells . ' ' They must have been heart-rending ? ' ' Probably . ' ' Do n't you remember ? ' ' Oh , yes , I remember . ' ' Go on . Do n't make me drag it from you by inches . Tell it to me in a pretty melodious narrative . Either that , or --  ' she touched her whistle . ' That 's barefaced intimidation . ' She raised the whistle to her lips . ' Stay , stay ! ' he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she answered . He bent his brows for an instant , then looked up smiling . ' If it puts you to sleep , you 'll know whom to blame . ' ' Yes , yes , go on , ' she said impatiently . ' Dear me , there 's nothing worth telling . It was a few weeks after my grandmother 's death . We were going to Paris the next day . Her father drove over , with her , to say good-bye . Whilst he was with my people in the drawing-room , she and I walked in the garden.  - -  I say , this is going to become frightfully sentimental , you know . Sure you want it ? ' ' Go on . Go on . ' ' Well , we walked in the garden ; and she was crying , and I was beseeching her not to cry . She wore one of her white frocks , with a red sash , and her hair fell down her back below her waist . I was holding her hand . " Do n't cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'm a man , and marry you in real earnest ! " I promised her . ' He paused and laughed . ' Go on . And she ? ' ' " Oh , are n't we married in real earnest now ? " she asked . I explained that we were n't . " You have to have the Notary over from Bayonne , and go to Church . I know , because that 's how it was when my cousin Elodie was married . We 're only married in play ? " Then she asked if that was n't just as good . " Things one does in play are always so much nicer than real things , " she said . ' ' Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings ! She had a prophetic soul . ' ' Had n't she ? I admitted that that was true . But I added that perhaps when people were grown up and could do exactly as they pleased , it was different , perhaps real things would come to be pleasant too . ' ' Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be quite grown-up , for I 've never yet had a chance to do exactly as I pleased . ' ' Poor young man . Go on . ' ' And , besides , I reminded her , all the married people we knew were really married , my father and mother , Andre 's father and mother , my cousin Elodie . Helene 's mother was dead , so her parents did n't count . And I argued that we might be sure they found it fun to be really married , or else they would n't keep it up . " Oh , well , then , I suppose we 'll have to be really married too , " she consented . " But it seems as though it never could be as nice as this . If only you were n't going away ! " Whereupon I promised again to come back , if she 'd promise to wait for me , and never love anybody else , and never , never , never allow another boy to kiss her . " Oh , never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father called her , and they drove away . ' ' And you went to Paris and forgot her . Why were you false to your engagement ? ' ' Oh , she had allowed another boy to kiss her . She had married a German prince . Besides , I received a good deal of discouragement from my family . The next day , in the train , I confided our understanding to my mother . My mother seemed to doubt whether her father would like me as a son-in-law . I was certain he would ; he was awfully good-natured ; he had given me two louis as a parting tip . " But do you think he 'll care to let his daughter marry a bourgeois ? " my mother asked . " A what ? " cried I. " A bourgeois , " said my mother . " I ai n't a bourgeois , " I retorted indignantly . " What are you then ? " pursued my mother . I explained that my grandmother had been a countess , and my uncle was a count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what is your father ? " my mother asked . Oh , my father was " only an Englishman . " But that did n't make me a bourgeois ? " Yes , it does , " my mother said . " Just because my father 's English ? " " Because he 's a commoner , because he is n't noble . " " But then -- then what did you go and marry him for ? " I stammered . " Where would you have been if I had n't ? " my mother enquired . That puzzled me for a moment , but then I answered , " Well , if you 'd married a Frenchman , a Count or a Duke or something , I should n't have been a bourgeois ; " and my mother confessed that that was true enough . " I do n't care if I am a bourgeois , " I said at last . " When I 'm big I 'm going back to Saint-Graal ; and if her father wo n't let me really marry her , because I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're married . " ' She laughed . ' And now you are big , and you 've come back to Saint-Graal , and your lady-love is at Granjolaye . Why do n't you call on her and offer to redeem your promise ? ' ' Why does n't she send for me -- bid me to an audience ? ' ' Perhaps her prophetic soul warns her how you 'd disappoint her . ' ' Do you think she 'd be disappointed in me ? ' ' Are n't you disappointed in yourself ? ' ' Oh , dear , no ; I think I 'm very nice . ' ' I should be disappointed in myself , if I were a man who had been capable of such an innocent , sweet affection as yours for Helene de la Granjolaye , and had then gone and soiled myself with the mud of what they call life .

' ' You told them you loved them ? ' ' I 'm afraid so . ' ' And was it true ? ' ' No . ' ' Well , then ! ' ' Ah , but they were n't deceived ; they never believed it .

It 's not my fault if I 've accepted the traditions of my century . Well , anyhow , you see I ca n't lie to you . ' ' You appear to find it difficult , ' she assented , rising . ' Well , what do you infer from that ? ' She blew her whistle . ' That -- that you 're out of training , ' she said lightly , as she mounted her horse . ' Oh , ' he groaned , ' you're --  ' ' What ? ' ' You beggar language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've spoiled everything , ' Paul said , and went home , and passed a sleepless night . XI . ' I 'll bet you sixpence she wo n't turn up to-day , ' he said to his friend in the glass , next morning ; nevertheless he went into the forest , and there she was . But she did not offer to dismount . ' Is n't there another inference to be drawn from my inability to lie to you ? ' he asked . She smiled on him from her saddle . ' Oh , perhaps there are a hundred . ' ' Do n't you think a reasonable inference is that -- I love you ? ' She laughed . ' You know I love you , ' he persisted . ' Oh , the conventions of the game ! the necesary formula , like " Dear " at the beginning of a letter ! ' she cried . ' You do n't believe me ?

They say she 's very good-looking . ' ' Nonsense . ' ' I should like to try you . ' ' I should n't fear the trial . ' ' Il ne faut jamais dire a la fontaine , je ne boirai pas de ton eau . ' ' But when one 's thirst is for wine ? ' ' It shows that there 's some relation between psychology and geography , after all , ' she said . ' What do you mean ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that you and she used to play a fugue on each other 's names . The spot raises ghosts . Ghosts of your old emotions . And I 'm conveniently at hand . ' ' If you could see yourself , you 'd understand that the influence of places is superfluous . If you could look into my heart you 'd recognise that my emotion is scarcely a ghost . ' ' There 's one thing I should like to see , ' she said . ' I should very much like to look into your garden at Saint-Graal . ' ' Would you ? ' he cried eagerly . ' When will you come ? ' ' Whenever you like ? ' ' Now . At once . ' ' No . To-morrow . ' ' To-morrow morning ? ' ' Yes . You can await me at your park-gates at eleven . ' ' Then you 'll lunch with me ? ' ' No .... Perhaps . ' ' You 're an angel ! ' And he trudged home on the air . ' If a woman will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman will come to see your garden ! ' XIII . That evening a servant handed him a letter . ' A footman has brought it from Granjolaye , and is waiting for an answer . ' The letter ran thus :  --  ' Monsieur : ' I am directed by Her Majesty the Queen Helene to request the pleasure of your company at the Chateau de Granjolaye to-morrow at eleven . Her Majesty desires me to add that she has only to-day learned of your presence in the country . ' Agreez , Monsieur , l'assurance de mes sentiments distingues , ' CTSSSE . DE WOLFENBACH . ' ' Oh , this is staggering , ' cried Paul . ' What to do ? ' He walked backwards and forwards , pondering his reply . ' I believe the only excuse that will pass with Royalty is illness or death . Shall I send word that I died suddenly this morning ? Ah , well , here goes for a thumping lie . ' And he wrote : ' Madame , I am unspeakably honoured by her Majesty 's command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it impossible for me to obey it . I am confined to my bed by a severe attack of bronchitis . Pray express to her Majesty my most respectful thanks as well as my profound regret . I shall hope to be able to leave my room at the week 's end , when , if her Majesty can be prevailed upon again to accord me an audience , I shall be infinitely grateful . ' ' There ! ' he muttered . ' I have perjured my soul for you , and made myself appear ridiculous into the bargain . Bronchitis ! But -- a demain ! Good -- good Lord ! if she should n't come ? ' XIV . She came , followed by a groom . She greeted Paul with a smile that made his heart leap with a wild hope . Her groom led Bezigue away to the stables . ' Thank you , ' said Paul . ' For what ? ' ' For everything . For coming . For that smile . ' ' Oh . ' They walked about the garden . ' It is lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' Show me where the irises grow , by the pond . ' And when they had arrived there , ' They do look like princesses , do n't they ? Your little friend had some perceptions . Show me where you and she used to sit down . I am tired . ' He led her into a corner of the rosery . She sank upon the turf . ' It is nice here , ' she said , ' and quite shut in . One would never know there was a house so near . ' She had taken off one of her gloves . Her soft white hand lay languidly in her lap . Suddenly Paul seized it , and kissed it -- furiously -- again and again . She yielded it . It was sweet to smell , and warm . ' My God , how I love you , how I love you ! ' he murmured . When he looked up , she was smiling . ' Oh , you are radiant ! You are divine ! ' he cried . And then her eyes filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You are unhappy ? ' ' Oh , no , ' she said . ' But to think -- to think that after all these years of misery , of heartbreak , it should end like this , here . ' ' Here ? ' he questioned . ' I am glad your bronchitis is better , but you can invent the most awful fibs , ' she said . He looked at her , while the universe whirled round him . ' Helene ! ' ' Paul ! ' XV . Her divorce did n't carry with it the right to marry again . But she said , ' We can go on making believe we 're married . Things one does in play are always so much nicer than real things . ' And when he spoke of the ' world , ' she answered , ' I have nothing to fear or to hope from the world . It has done its worst by me already . ' As they walked back to the house for luncheon , Paul looked into her face , and said , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled and took his arm . ' J ' t'aime tant , ' she whispered . ' And now I ca n't believe my ears ! ' And this would appear to be the end , but I suppose it ca n't be , for everybody says nowadays that nothing ever ends happily here below . ***
