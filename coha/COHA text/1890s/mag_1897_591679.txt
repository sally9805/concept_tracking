EMERSON , SIXTY YEARS AFTER . II . THE attitude of Emerson 's mind toward reformers results so logically from his philosophy that it is easily understood . He saw in them people who sought something as a panacea or as an end in itself . To speak strictly and not irreverently , he had his own panacea , - the development of each individual ; and he was impatient of any other . He did not believe in association . The very idea of it involved a surrender by the individual of some portion of his identity , and of course all the reformers worked through their associations . With their general aims he sympathized . " These reforms , " he wrote , " are our contemporaries ; they are ourselves , our own light and sight and conscience ; they only name the relation which subsists between us and the vicious institutions which they go to rectify . " But with the methods of the reformers he had no sympathy : " He who aims at progress should aim at an infinite , not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land with temperance , anti-slavery , non-resistance , no-government , equal labor , fair and generous as each appears , are poor bitter things when prosecuted for themselves as an end . " Again : " The young men who have been vexing society for these last years with regenerative methods seem to have made this mistake : they all exaggerated some special means , and all failed // to see that the reform of reforms must be accomplished without means . " lEmerson did not at first discriminate between the movement of the Abolitionists and the hundred and one other reform movements of the period ; and in this lack of discrimination lies a point of extraordinary interest . The Abolitionists , as it afterwards turned out , had in fact got hold of the issue which was to control the fortunes of the republic for thirty years . The difference between them and the other reformers was this : that the Abolitionists were men set in motion by the primary and unreasoning passion of pity . Theory played small part in the movement . It grew by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensitive people . It is not to be denied that the social conditions in Boston in 1831 foreboded an outbreak in some form . If the abolition excitement had not drafted off the rising forces , there might have been a Merry Mount , an epidemic of crime or insanity , or a mob of some sort . The abolition movement afforded the purest form of an indulgence in human feeling that was ever offered to men . It was intoxicating . It made the agitators perfectly happy . They sang at their work and bubbled over with exhilaration . They were the only people in the United States , at this time , who were enjoying an exalted , glorifying , practical activity . But Emerson at first lacked the touchstone , whether of intellect or of heart , to see the difference between this particular movement and the other movements then in progress : Indeed , in so far as he sees any difference between the Abolitionists and the rest , it is that the Abolitionists were more objectionable and distasteful to him . " Those , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are called the greatest benefits to mankind are narrow , conceited , self-pleasing men , and affect us as the insane do . " He was drawn into the abolition cause by having the truth brought home to him that these people were fighting for the Moral Law . He was slow in seeing this , because in their methods they represented everything he most condemned . As soon , however , as he was convinced , he was ready to lecture for them and to give them the weight of his approval . In 1844 he was already practically an Abolitionist , and his feelings upon the matter deepened steadily in intensity ever after . The most interesting page of Emerson 's published journal is the following , written at some time previous to 1844 ; the exact date is not given . A like page , whether written or unwritten , may be read into the private annals of every man who lived before the war . Emerson has , with unconscious mastery , photographed the half-spectre that stalked in the minds of all . He wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Hoar that I like best the strong and worthy persons , like her father , who support the social order without hesitation or misgiving . I like these ; they never incommode us by exciting grief , pity , or perturbation of any sort . But the professed philanthropists , it is strange and horrible to say , are an altogether odious set of people , whom one would shun as the worst of bores and canters . But my conscience , my unhappy conscience respects that hapless class who see the faults and stains of our social order , and who pray and strive incessantly to right the wrong ; this annoying class of men and women , though they commonly find the work altogether beyond their faculty , and their results are , for the present , distressing . They are partial and apt to magnify their own . Yes , and the prostrate penitent , also , - he is not comprehensive , he is not philosophical in those tears and groans . Yet I feel that under him and his partiality and exelusivaness is the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the // axis around which the universe revolves passes through his body where he stands . " It was the defection of Daniel Webster that completed the conversion of Emerson and turned him from an adherent into a propagandist of abolition . Not pity for the slave , but indignation at the violation of the Moral Law by Daniel Webster , was at the bottom of Emerson 's anger . His abolitionism was secondary to his main mission , his main enthusiasm . It is for this reason that he stands on a plane of intellect where he might , under other circumstances , have met and defeated Webster . After the 7th of March , 1850 , he recognized in Webster the embodiment of all that he hated . In his attacks on Webster , Emerson trembles to his inmost fibre with antagonism . He is savage , destructive , personal , bent on death . This exhibition of Emerson as a fighting animal is magnificent and explains his life . There is no other instance of his ferocity . No other nature but Webster 's ever so moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Webster was a man of his size . Had these two great men of New England been matched in training as they were matched in endowment , and had they then faced each other in debate , they would not have been found to differ so greatly in power . Their natures were electrically repellent , but from which did the greater force radiate ? Their education differed so radically that it is impossible to compare them , but if you translate the Phi Beta Kappa address into politics , you have something stronger than Webster , - something that recalls Chatham ; and Emerson would have had this advantage , - that he was not afraid . As it was , he left his library and took the stump . Mr. Cabot has given us extracts from his speeches - " The tameness is indeed complete ; all are involved in one hot haste of terror , - presidents of colleges and professors , saints and brokers , lawyers and manufacturers ; not a liberal recollection , not so much as a snatch of an old song for freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Webster , perhaps , is only following the laws of his blood and constitution . I suppose his pledges were not quite natural to him . He is a man who lives by his memory ; a man of the past , not a man of faith arid of hope . All the drops of his blood have eyes that look downward , and his finely developed understanding only works truly and with all its force when it stands for animal good ; that is , for property . He looks at the Union as an estate , a large farm , and is excellent in the completeness of his defense of it so far . What he finds already written he will defend . Lucky that so much had got well written when he came , for he has no faith in the power of self-government . Not the smallest municipal provision , if it were new , would receive his sanction . In Massachusetts , in 1776 , he would , beyond all question , have been a refugee . He praises Adams and Jefferson , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams or Jefferson he would denounce . . . . But one thing appears certain to me : that the Union is at an end as soon as an immoral law is enacted . He who writes a crime into the statute book digs under the foundations of the Capitol . . . . The words of John Randolph , wiser than he knew , have been ringing ominously in all echoes for thirty years : We do not govern the people of the North by our black slaves , but by their own white slaves . . They come down now like the cry of fate , in the moment when they are fulfilled . " The exasperation of Emerson did not subside , but went on increasing during the next four years , and on March 7 , 1854 , lie read his lecture on the Fugitive Slave Law at the New York Tabernacle : " I have lived all my life without suffering any inconvenience from Amen // caxi Slavery . I never saw it ; I never heard the whip ; I never felt the check on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Mr. Webster , by his personal influence , brought the Fugitive Slave Law on the country . I say Mr. Webster , for though the bill was not his , it is yet notorious that he was the life and soul of it , that lie gave it all he had . It cost him his life , and under the shadow of his great name inferior men sheltered themselves , threw their ballots for it , and made the law . " It was too late for Emerson to shine as a political debater . On May 14 , 1857 , Longfellow wrote in his diary , " It is rather painful to see Emerson in the arena of politics , hissed and hooted at by young law students . " Emerson records a similar experience at a later date : " If I were dumb , yet would I have gone and mowed and muttered or made signs . The mob roared whenever I attempted to speak , and after several beginnings I withdrew . " There is nothing " painful " here : it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing to be noted is that this is the same man , in the same state of excitement about the same idea , who years before spoke out in The American Scholar , in the Essays , and in the Lectures . What was it that had aroused in Emerson such Promethean antagonism in 1837 but those same forces which in 1850 came to their culmination and assumed visible shape in the person of Daniel Webster ? The formal victory of Webster drew Emerson into the arena , and made a dramatic episode in his life . But his battle with those forces had begun thirteen years earlier , when he threw down the gauntlet to them in his Phi Beta Kappa oration . Emerson by his writings did more than any other man to rescue the youth of the next generation and fit them for the fierce times to follow . It will not be denied that he sent ten thousand sons to the war . In speaking of Emerson 's attitude toward the anti-slavery cause , it has been possible to dispense with any survey of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well remembered . But when we come to analyze the relations he bore to some of the local agitations of his day , it becomes necessary to weave in with the matter a discussion of certain tendencies deeply imbedded in the life of his times , and of which he himself was in a sense an outcome . In speaking of the Transcendentalists , who were essentially the children of the Puritans , we must begin with some study of the chief traits of Puritanism . What parts the factors of climate , circumstance , and religion have respectively played in the development of the New England character no analysis can determine . We may trace the imaginary influence of a harsh creed in the lines of the face . We may sometimes follow from generation to generation the course of a truth which at first sustained the spirit of man , till we see it petrify into a dogma which now kills the spirits of men . Conscience may destroy the character . The tragedy of the New England judge enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law was no new spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts had been in progress there for two hundred years . Emerson , who is more free from dogma than any other teacher that can be named , yet comes very near being dogmatic in his reiteration of the Moral Law . Whatever volume of Emerson we take up , the Moral Law holds the same place in his thoughts . It is the one statable jevelation of truth which he is ready to stake his all upon . " We affirm that in all men is this majestic perception and command ; that it is the presence of the eternal in each perishing man ; that it distances and degrades all statements of whatever saints , heroes , poets , as obscure and confused stammerings before its silent revelation . They ' report the truth . It is the truth . " In this extract we have Emer // son actually affirming that his dogma of the Moral Law is Absolute Truth . He thinks it not merely a form of truth , like the old theologies , but very distinguishable from all other forms in the past . Curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incisive in proportion as he approaches the borderland between his law and the natural instincts : " The last revelation of intellect and of sentiment is that in a manner it severs the man from all other men ; makes known to him that the spiritual powers are sufficient to him if no other being existed ; that he is to deal absolutely in the world , as if he alone were a system and a state , and though all should perish could make all anew . " Here we have the dogma applied , and we see in it only a new form of old Calvinism as cruel as Calvinism , and not much different from its original . The italics are not Emerson 's , but are inserted to bring out an idea which is everywhere prevalent in his teaching . In this final form , the Moral Law , by insisting that sheer conscience can slake the thirst that rises in the soul , is convicted of falsehood ; and this heartless falsehood is the same falsehood that has been put into the porridge of every Puritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine and sleep at night . But a young person of high purpose and strong will , who takes such a lie as this half-truth and feeds on it as on the bread of life , will suffer . It will injure the action of his heart . Truly the fathers have eaten sour grapes , therefore the children 's teeth are set on edge . To understand the civilization of cities , we must look at the rural population from which they draw their life . We have recently had our attention called to the last remnants of that village life so reverently gathered up by Miss Wilkins , and of which Miss Emily Dickinson was the last authentic voice . The spirit of this age has examined with an almost pathological interest this rescued society . We must go to it if we would understand Emerson , who is the blossoming of its culture . We must study it if we would arrive at any intelligent and general view of that miscellaneous crop of individuals who have been called the Transcendentalists . Between 1830 and 1840 there were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society were not quite wholesome , not exactly well adjusted . Self-repression was the religion which had been inherited . " Distrust Nature " was the motto written upon the front of the temple . What would have happened to that society if left to itself for another hundred years no man can guess . It was rescued by the two great regenerators of mankind , new land and war . The dispersion came , as Emerson said of the barbarian conquests of Rome , not a day too soon . It happened that the country at large stood in need of New England as much as New England stood in need of the country . This congested virtue , in order to be saved , must be scattered . This ferment , in order to be kept wholesome , must be used as leaven to leaven the whole lump . " As you know , " says Emerson in his Eulogy on Boston , " New England supplies annually a large detachment of preachers and schoolmasters and private tutors to the interior of the South and West . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to see our hives swarm . That is what they were made to do , and what the land wants and invites . " For purposes of yeast , there was never such leaven as the Puritan stock . How little the natural force of the race had really abated became apparent when it was placed under healthy conditions , given land to till , foes to fight , the chammee to renew its youth like the eagle . But during this period the relief had not yet come . The terrible pressure of Puritanism and conservatismn in New England was causing a revolt not only of the // Abolitionists , but of another class of people of a type not so virile as they . The times have been smartly described by Lowell in his essay on Thoreau - " Every possible form of intellectual and physical dyspepsia brought forth its gospel . Bran had its prophets. - - Everybody had a Mission ( with a capital NI ) to attend to everybody else 's business . No brain but had its private maggot , which must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zealots abjured the use of money ( unless earned by other people ) , professing to live on the internal revenues of the spirit . Some had an assurance of instant millennium so soon as hooks and eyes should be substituted for buttons . Communities were established where everything was to be common but common sense . . . - Conventions were held for every hitherto inconceivable purpose. ** Whatever may be said of the Transcendentalists , it must not be forgotten that they represented an elevation of feeling , which through them qualified the next generation , and can be traced in the life of New England to-day . The strong intrinsic character lodged in these recusants was later made manifest ; for many of them became the best citizens of the commonwealth , - statesmen , merchants , soldiers , men and women of affairs . They retained their idealism while becoming practical men . There is hardly an example of what we should have thought would be common in their later lives , namely , a reaction from so much ideal effort , and a plunge into cynicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early life they resembled the Abolitionists in their devotion to an idea ; but with the Transcendentalists self-culture and the resthetic and sentimental education took the place of more public aims . They seem also to have been persons of greater social refinement than the Abolitionists . The Transcendentalists were sure of only one thing , - that society as constituted was all wrong . In this their main belief they were right . They were men and women whose fundamental need was activity , contact with real life , and the opportunity for social expansion ; and they keenly felt the chill and fictitious character of the reigning conventionalities . The rigidity of behavior which at this time characterized the Bostonians seemed sometimes ludicrous and sometimes disagreeable to the foreign visitor . There was great gravity , together with a certain pomp and dumbness , and these things were supposed to be natural to the inhabitants and to give them joy . People are apt to forget that such masks are never worn with ease . They result from the application of an inflexible will , and always inflict discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society as artificial in its decorum as the court of France during the last years of Louis XIV . Emerson was in no way responsible for the movement , although he got the credit of having evoked it by his teaching . He was elder brother to it , and was generated by its parental forces ; but even if Emerson had never lived , the Transcendentalists would have appeared . He was their victim rather than their cause . He was always tolerant of them and sometimes amused at them , and disposed to treat them lightly . It is impossible to analyze their case with more astuteness than he did in an editorial letter in The Dial . The letter is cold , but is a masterpiece of good sense . He had , he says , received fifteen letters on the Prospects of Culture . " Excellent reasons have been shown us why the writers , obviously persons of sincerity and elegance , should be dissatisfied with the life they lead , and with their company . .. - They want a friend to whom they can speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable word . " After discussing one or two of their proposals , - one of which was that the tiresome " uncles and aunts " of the // enthusiasts should be placed by themselves in one delightful village , the dough , as Emerson says , be placed in one pan and the leaven in another , - he continues : " But it would be unjust not to remind our younger friends that whilst this aspiration has always made its mark in the lives of men of thought , in vigorous individuals it does not remain a detached object , but is satisfied along with the satisfaction of other aims . " Young Americans " are educated above the work of their times and country , and disdain it . Many of the more acute minds pass into a lofty criticism . . . which only embitters their sensibility to the evil , and widens the feeling of hostility between them and the citizens at large . " " We should not know where to find in literature any record of so much unbalanced intellectuality , such undeniable apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our young men pretend to . " He then turns to find the cure for these distempers in the farm lands of Illinois , at that time already being fenced in " almost like New England itself , " and closes with a suggestion that so long as there is a woodpile in the yard , and the " wrongs of the Indian , of the Negro , of the emigrant , remain unulitigated , " relief might be found even nearer home . In his lecture on the Transcendentalists he says : " But their solitary and fastidious manners not only withdraw them from the conversation , but from the labors of the world : they are not good citizens , not good members of society ; unwillingly they bear their part of the public and private burdens ; they do not willingly share in the public charities , in the public religious rites , in the enterprises of education , of missions foreign and domestic , in the abolition of the slave-trade , or in the temperance society . They do not even like to vote . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : " While Margaret Fuller and her adult pupils sat gorgeously dressed , ' talking about Mars and Venus , Plato and Goethe , and fancying themselves the elect of the earth in intellect and refinement , the liberties of the republic were running out as fast as they could go at a breach which another sort of elect persons were devoting themselves to repair ; and my complaint against the gorgeous ' pedants was that they regarded their preservers as hewers of wood and drawers of water , and their work as a less vital one than the pedantic orations which were spoiling a set of well-meaning women in a pitiable way . " Harriet Martineau , whose whole work was practical , and who wrote her journal in 1855 and in the light of history , was hardly able to do justice to these unpractical but sincere spirits . Emerson was divided from the Transcendentalists by his common sense . His shrewd business intellect made short work of their schenies . Each one of their social projects contained some covert economic weakness , which always turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which Emerson of all men could be counted on to detect . He was divided from them also by the fact that he was a man of genius , who had sought out and fought out his means of expression . He was a great artist , and as such he was a complete being . No one could give to him nor take from him . His yearnings found fruition in expression . He was sure of his place and of his use in this world . But the Transcendentalists were neither geniuses nor artists nor complete beings . Nor had they found their places or uses as yet . They were men and women seeking light . They walked in dry places , seeking rest and finding none . The Transcendentalists are not collectively important because their Sturm und Drang was intellectual and bloodless . Though Emerson admonish and Harriet Martineau condemn , yet from the memorials that survive one is more im // pressed with the sufferings than with the ludicrousness of these persons . There is something distressing about their letters , their talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contort and introspect . They rave and dream . They peep and theorize . They cut open the bellows of life to see where the wind comes from . Margaret Fuller analyzes Emerson , and Emerson Margaret Fuller . It is not a wholesome ebullition of vitality . It is a nightmare , in which the emotions , the terror , the agony , the rapture , are all unreal , and have no vital content , no consequence in the world outside . It is positively wonderful that so much excitement and so much suffering should have left behind nothing in the field of art which is valuable . All that intelligence could do toward solving problems for his friends Emerson did . But there are situations in life in which the intelligence is helpless , and in which something else , something perhaps possessed by a ploughboy , is more divine than Plato . If it were not pathetic , there would be something cruel - indeed there is something cruel - in Emerson 's incapacity to deal with Margaret Fuller . lie wrote to her on October 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your frank and noble and affecting letter , and yet I think I could wish it unwritten . I ought never to have suffered you to lead me into any conversation or writing on our relation to a topic from which with all persons my Genius warns me away. ** The letter proceeds with unimpeachable emptiness and integrity in the same strain . In 1841 he writes in his diary : " Strange , cold - warm , attractive - repelling conversation with Margaret , whom I always admire , most revere when I nearest see , and sometimes love ; yet whom I freeze and who freezes me to silence when we promise to come nearest . " Human sentiment was known to Emerson mainly in the form of pain . His nature shunned it ; he cast it off as quickly as possible . There is a word or two in the essay on Love which seems to show that the inner and diaphanous core of this seraph had once , but not for long , been shot with blood : he recalls only the pain of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lasted for years . This brilliant woman was in distress . She was asking for bread , and he was giving her a stone , and neither of them was conscious of what was passing . This is pitiful . It makes us clutch about us to catch hold , if we somehow may , of the hand of a man . There was manliness in Horace Greeley , under whom Miss Fuller worked on the New York Tribune not many years afterward . She wrote : " Mr. Greeley I like , - nay , more , love . He is in his habit a plebeian , in his heart a nobleman . His abilities in his own way are great . He believes in mine to a surprising degree . We are true friends . " This anvemic incompleteness of Emerson 's character can be traced to the philosophy of his race ; at least it can be followed in that philosophy . There is au implication of a fundamental falsehood in every bit of Transcendentalism , including Emerson . That falsehood consists in the theory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret Fuller is a good example of the effect of this philosophy , because her history afterward showed that she was constituted like other human beings , was dependent upon human relationship , and was not only a very noble , but also a very womanly creature . Her marriage , her Italian life , and her tragic death light up with the splendor of reality the earlier and unhappy period of her life . This woman had been driven into her vagaries by the lack of something which she did not know existed , and which she sought blindly in metaphysics . Harriet Martinean writes of her : " It is the most grievous loss I have almost ever // known in private history , the deferring of Margaret Fuller 's married life so long . That noble last period of her life is happily on record as well as the earlier . " The hardy Englishwoman has here laid a kind human hand on the weakness of New England , and seems to be unconscious that she is making a revelation as to the whole Transcendental movement . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of Margaret Fuller , in her early days , who knew what was her need . One offered her Kant , one Comte , one Fourier , one Swedenborg , one the Moral Law . You can not feed the heart on these things . Yet there is a bright side to this New England spirit , which seems , if we look only to the graver emotions , so dry , dismal , and deficient . A bright and cheery courage appears in certain natures of which the sun has made conquest , that almost reconciles us to all loss , so splendid is the outcome . The practical , dominant , insuppressible active temperaments who have a word for every emergency , and who carry the controlled force of ten men at their disposal , are the fruits of this same spirit . Emerson knew not tears , but he and the hundred other beaming and competent characters which New England has produced make us almost envy their state . They give us again the old Stoics at their best . Very closely connected with this subject - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which any discussion of Emerson must bring up , namely , Asceticism . It is probable that in dealing with Emerson 's feelings nbout the plastic arts we have to do with what is really the inside , or metaphysical side , of the same phenomena which present themselves on the outside , or physical side , in the shape of asceticism . Emerson 's natural asceticism is revealed to us in almost every form in which history can record a man . It is in his philosophy , in his style , in his conduct , and in his appearance . It was , however , not in his voice . Mr. Cabot , with that reverence for which every one must feel personally grateful to him , has preserved a description of Emerson by the New York journalist , N. P. Willis : " It is a voice with shoulders in it , which he has not ; with lungs in it far larger than his ; with a walk which the public never see ; with a fist in it which his own hand never gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parochial and barenecessaries-of-life ' sort of exterior gives no other betrayal of . We can imagine nothing in nature ( which seems too to have a type for everything ) like the want of correspondence between the Emerson that goes in at the eye and the Emerson that goes in at the ear . A heavy and vase-like blossom of a magnolia , with fragrance enough to perfume a whole wilderness , which should be lifted by a whirlwind and dropped into a branch of aspen , would not seem more as if it could never have grown there than Emerson 's voice seems inspired and foreign to his visible and natural body . " Emerson 's ever exquisite and wonderful good taste seems closely connected with this asceticism , and it is probable that his taste influenced his views and conduct to some small extent . The anti-slavery people were not always refined . They were constantly doing things which were tactically very effective , but were not calculated to attract the over-sensitive . Garrison 's rampant and impersonal egotism was good politics , but bad taste . Wendell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an exasperating kind . One sees a certain shrinking in Emerson from the taste of the Abolitionists . It was not merely their doctrines or their methods which offended him . He at one time refused to give Wendell Phillips his hand because of Phillips 's treatment of his friend , Judge Hoar . One hardly knows whether to be pleased at // Emerson for showing a human weakness , or annoyed at him for not being more of a man . The anecdote is valuable in both lights . It is like a tiny speck on the crystal of his character which shows us the exact location of the orb , and it is the best illustration of the feeling of the times which has come down to us . If by " asceticism " we mean an experiment in starving the senses , there is little harm in it . Nature will soon reassert her dominion , and very likely our perceptions will be sharpened by the trial . But " natural asceticism " is a thing hardly to be distinguished from functional weakness . What is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to close the avenues between the soul and the universe ? " Is it not so much death ? " The accounts of Emerson show him to have been a man in whom there was almost a hiatus between the senses and the most inward spirit of life . The lower register of sensations and emotions which domesticate a man into fellowship with common life was weak . Genial familiarity was to him impossible ; laughter was almost a pain . It is not the sea and poverty and pursuit that separate us . Here is Alcott by my door , - yet is the union more profound ? No ! the sea , vocation , poverty , are seeming fences , but man is insular and can not be touched . Every man is an infinitely repellent orb , and holds his individual being on that condition . Most of the persons whom I see in my own house I see across a gulf ; I can not go to them nor they come to me . " This aloofness of Emerson must be remembered only as blended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " and , as Dr. Holmes said , *his smile was the well-remembered line of Terence written out in living features . " Emerson 's journals show the difficulty of his intercourse even with himself . He could not reach himself at will , nor could another reach him . The sensuous and ready contact with nature which more carnal people enjoy was unknown to him . He had eyes for the New England landscape , but for no other scenery . If there is one supreme sensation reserved for man , it is the vision of Venice seen from the water . This sight greeted Emerson at the age of thirty . The famous city , as he approached it by boat , " looked for some time like nothing but New York . It is a great oddity , a city for beavers , but to my thought a most disagreeable residence . You feel always in prison and solitary . It is as if you were always at sea . I soon had enough of it . " Emerson 's contempt for travel and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to need citation . It proceeds from the same deficiency of sensation . His eyes saw nothing ; his ears heard nothing . He believed that men traveled for distraction and to kill time . The most vulgar plutocrat could not be blinder to beauty nor bring home less from Athens than this cultivated saint . Everythirig in the world which must be felt with a glow in the breast , in order to be understood , was to him dead-letter . Art was a name to him ; music was a name to him ; love was a name to him . His essay on Love is a nice compilation of compliments and elegant phrases ending up with some icy morality . It seems very well fitted for a gift-book or an old-fashioned lady 's annual . " The lovers delight in endearments , in avowals of love , in comparisons of their regards . . . . The soul which is in the soul of each , craving a perfect beatitude , detects incongruities , defects , and disproportion in the behavior of the other . Hence arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew them to each other was signs of loveliness , signs of virtue ; and these virtues are there , however eclipsed . They appear and reappear and continue to attract ; but the regard chaiiges , quits the sign and attaches to the substance . This repairs the wounded affection . Meantime , as // life wears on , it proves a game of permutation and combination of all possible positions of the parties , to employ all the resources of each and acquaint each with the weakness of the other . . . . At last they discover that all which at first drew them together - those once sacred features , that magical play of charms - was deciduous , had a prospective end like the scaffolding by which the house was built , and the pnrification of the intellect and the heart from year to year is the real marriage , foreseen and prepared from the first , and wholly above their consciousness . . . . Thus are we put in training for a love which knows not sex nor person nor partiality , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing virtue and wisdom . . . . There are moments when the affections rule and absorb the man , and make his happiness dependent on a person or persons . But in health the mind is presently seen again , " etc . All this is not love , but the merest literary coquetry . Love is different from this . Lady Burton , when a very young girl , and six years before her engagement , met Burton at Boulogne . They met in the street , but did not speak . A few days later they were formally introduced at a dance . Of this she writes : " That was a night of nights . He waltzed with me once , and spoke to me several times . I kept the sash where he put his arm around me and my gloves , and never wore them again . " A glance at what Emerson says about marriage shows that he suspected that institution . He can hardly speak of it without some sort of caveat or precaution . " Though the stuff of tragedy and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose confidence in each other for long years , out of sight and in sight , and against all appearances , is at last justified by victorious proof of probity to gods and men , causing joyful emotions , tears , and glory , - though there be for heroes this moral union , yet they too are as far as ever from an intellectual union , and the moral is for low and external purposes , like the corporation of a ship 's company or of a fire club . " In speaking of modern novels , he says : " There is no new element , no power , no furtherance . T is only confectionery , not the raising of new corn . Great is the poverty of their inventions . She was beautiful , and he fell in love . " " Too pathetic , too pitiable , is the region of affection , and its atmosphere always liable to mirage . " We are all so concerned that a man who writes about love shall tell the truth that if he chance to start from premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely false , but offensive . It makes no matter how exalted the personal character of the writer may be . Neither sanctity nor intellect nor moral enthusiasm , though they be intensified to the point of incandescence , can make up for a want of nature . This perpetual splitting up of love into two species , one of which is condemned , but admitted to be useful , is it not degrading ? There is in Emerson 's theory of the relation between the sexes neither good sense , nor manly feeling , nor sound psychology . It is founded on none of these things . It is a pure piece of dogmatism , and reminds us that he was bred to the priesthood . We are not to imagine that there was in this doctrine anything peculiar to Emerson . But we are surprised to find the pessimism inherent in the doctrine overcome Emerson , to whom pessimism is foreign . Both doctrine and pessimism are a part of the Puritanism of the times . They show a society in which the intellect had long been used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislocated from the body . To this disintegration of the simple passion of love may be traced the lack of maternal tenderness characteristic of the New England nature . The relation between the blood and the brain was not quite normal in // this civilization , nor in Emerson who is its most remarkable representative . If we take two steps backward from the canvas of this mortal life and glance at it impartially , we shall see that these matters of love and marriage pass like a pivot through the lives of almost every individual , and are , sociologically speaking , the primurn mobile of the world . The books of any philosopher who slurs them or distorts them will hold up a false mirror to life . If an inhabitant of another planet should visit the earth , he would receive , on the whole , a truer notion of human life by attending an Italian opera than he would by reading Emerson 's volumes . He would learn from the Italian opera that there were two sexes : and this , after all , is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin . In a review of Emerson 's personal character and opinions , we are thus led to see that his philosophy , which finds no room for the emotions , is a faithful exponent of his own and of the New England temperament , which distrusts and dreads the emotions . Regarded as a sole guide to life for a young person of strong conscience and undeveloped affections , his works might conceivably be even harmful because of their unexampled power of purely intellectual stimulation . Emerson 's poetry has given rise to much heart-burning and disagreement . Some people do not like it . They fail to find the fire in the ice . On the other hand , his poems appeal not only to a large number of professed lovers of poetry , but also to a class of readers who find in Emerson an element for which they search the rest of poesy in vain . It is the irony of fate that his admirers should be more than usually sensitive about his fame . This prophet who desired not to have followers , lest he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose main thesis throughout life was that piety is a crime , has been calmly canonized and embalmed in amber by the very forces he braved . He is become a tradition and a sacred relic . You must speak of him under your breath , and you may not laugh near his shrine . Emerson 's passion for nature was not like the passion of Keats or of Burns , of Coleridge or of Robert Browning ; compared with these men he is cold . His temperature is below blood-heat , and his volume of poems stands on the shelf of English poets like the icy fish which in Caliban upon Setebos is described as finding himself thrust into the warm ooze of an ocean not his own . But Emerson is a poet , nevertheless , a very extraordinary and rare man of genius , whose verses carry a world of their own within them . They are overshadowed by the greatness of his prose , but they are authentic . He is the chief poet of that school of which Emily Dickinson is a minor poet . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His worship of the New England landscape amounts to a religion . His poems do that most wonderful thing , make us feel that we are alone in the fields and with the trees , - not English fields nor French lanes , but New England meadows and uplands . There is no human creature in sight , not even Emerson is there , but the wind and the flowers , the wild birds , the fences , the transparent atmosphere , the breath of nature . There is a deep and true relation between the intellectual and almost dry brilliancy of Emerson 's feelings and the landscape itself . Here is no defective English poet , no Shelley without the charm , but an American poet , a New England poet with two hundred years of New England culture and New England landscape in him . People are forever speculating upon what will last , what posterity will approve , and some people believe that Emerson s poetry will outlive his prose . The question is idle . The poems are // alive now , and they may or may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing is plain : they have qualities which have preserved poetry in the past . They are utterly indigenous and sincere . They are short . They represent a civilization and a climate . His verse divides itself into several classes . We have the single lyrics , written somewhat in the style of the later seventeenth century . Of these The Humhle Bee is the most exquisite , and although its tone and inlagery can be traced to various well-known and dainty hits of poetry , it is by no means an imitation . hut a masterpiece of fine taste . The Rhodora and Terminus and perhaps a few others belong to that class of poetry which , like Abou Ben Adhem , is poetry because it is the perfection of statement . The Boston Hymn , the Concord Ode , and the other occasional pieces fall in another class , and do not seem to be important . The first two lines of the Ode , " 0 tenderly the haughty day Fills his blue urn with fire , " are for their extraordinary beauty worthy of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the lines are commonplace . Throughout his poems there are good bits , happy and golden lines , snatches of grace . He himself knew the quality of his poetry , and wrote of it , " All were sifted through and through , Five lines lasted sound and true . " He is never merely conventional , and his poetry , like his prose , is homespun and sound . But his ear was defective : his rhymes are crude , and his verse is often lame and unmusical , a fault which can be countervailed by nothing but force , and force he lacks . To say that his ear was defective is hardly strong enough . Passages are not uncommon which hurt the reader and unfit him to proceed ; as , for example : - " Thorough a thousaud voices Spoke the universal dame : Who telleth one of my meanings Is master of all I am . ' " He himself has very well described the impression his verse is apt to make on a new reader when he says , - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers of Emerson 's poems freely acknowledge all these defects , hut find in them another element , very subtle and rare , very refined and elusive , and altogether unique . This is the mystical element or strain which qualifies many of his poems , and to which some of them are wholly devoted . There has been so much discussion as to Emerson 's relation to the mystics that it is well here to turn aside for a moment and consider the matter by itself . The elusiveness of " mysticism " arises out of the fact that it is not a creed , but a state of mind . It is formulated into no dogmas , but , in so far as it is communicable , it is conveyed , or sought to be conveyed , by symbols . These symbols to a skeptical or an unsympathetic person will say nothing , hut the presumption among those who are inclined towards the cult is that if these symbols convey anything at all , that thing is mysticism . The mystics are right . The familiar phrases , terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance at them shows that they do tend to express and evoke a somewhat definite psychic condition . There is a certain mood of mind experienced by most of us in which we feel the mystery of existence ; in which our consciousness seems to become suddenly separated from our thoughts , and we find ourselves asking , " Who am I ? What are these thoughts ? " The mood is very apt to overtake us while engaged in the commonest acts . In health it is always momentary , and seems to coincide with the instant of the transition and shift of our attention from one thing to another . It is probably connected with the transfer of energy from one set of faculties to another set , which occurs , for instance , on our waking from sleep , on our hearing a bell at night , on our // observing any common object , a chair or a pitcher , at a time when our mind is or has just been thoroughly preoccupied with something else . This displacement of the attention occurs in its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open fields . Nature then attacks us on all sides at once , overwhelms , drowns , and destroys our old thoughts , stimulates vaguely and all at once a thousand new ideas , dissipates all focus of thought and dissolves our attention . If we happen to be mentally f atigued , and we take a walk in the country , a sense of immense relief , of rest and joy , which nothing else on earth can give , accompanies this distraction of the mind from its problems . The reaction fills us with a sense of mystery and expansion . It brings us to the threshold of those spiritual experiences which are the obscure core and reality of our existence , ever alive within us , but generally veiled and sub-conscious . It brings us , as it were , into the ante-chamber of art , poetry , and music . The condition is one of excitation and receptiveness , where art may speak and we shall understand . On the other hand , the condition shows a certain dethronement of the will and attention which may ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate this method of nature by calling on us with a thousand voices at once . Poetry deals often with vague or contradictory statements , with a jumble of images , a throng of impressions . But in true poetry the psychology of real life is closely followed . The mysticism is momentary . We are not kept suspended in a limbo , " trembling like a guilty thing surprised , " but are ushered into another world of thought and feeling . On the other hand , a mere statement of inconceivable things is the reductio ad absurdum of poetry , because such a statement puzzles the mind , scatters the attention , and does to a certain extent superinduce the " blank misgivings " of mysticism . It does this , however , without going further and filling the mind with new life . If I bid a man follow my reasoning closely , and then say , " I am the slayer and the slain , I am the doubter and the doubt , " I puzzle his mind , and may succeed in reawakening in him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ignorant of our own destinies and can not grasp the meaning of life . If I do this , nothing can be a more legitimate opening for a poem , for it is an opening of the reader 's mind . Emerson , like many other highly organized persons , was acquainted with the mystic mood . It was not momentary with him . It haunted him , and he seems to have believed that the whole of poetry and religion was contained in the mood . And no one can gainsay that this mental condition is intimately connected with our highest feelings and leads directly into them . The fault with Emerson is that he stops in the ante-chamber of poetry . He is content if he has brought us to the hypnotic point . His prologue and overture are excellent , but where is the argument ? Where is the substantial artistic content that shall feed our souls ? The Sphinx is a fair example of an Emerson poem . The opening verses are musical , though they are handicapped by a reminiscence of the German way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charming reverie , and then at the end suddenly jolted by the question , " What is it all about ? ' * In this poem we see expanded into four or five pages of verse an experience which in real life endures an eighth of a second , and when we come to the end of the mood we are at the end of the poem . There is no question that the power to throw your sitter into a receptive mood by a pass or two which shall give you his virgin attention is necessary to any artist . Nobody has the knack of this more strongly than Emerson in his prose writings . By a phrase or a common remark he creates an ideal atmosphere in which his thought has the directness of great // poetry . But lie can not do it in verse . He seeks in his verse to do the very thing which he avoids doing in his prose : follow a logical method . He seems to know too much what he is about , and to be content with doing too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of such criticism as this , are all alike in that they all seek to do the same thing . Nor does he always succeed . How does he sometimes fail in verse to say what he conveys with such everlasting happiness in prose ! " I am owner of the sphere , Of the seven stars and the solar year , Of Cnsar 's hand and Plato 's brain , Of Lord Christ 's heart and Shakespeare 's strain . " In these lines we have the same thought which appears a few pages later in prose : *All that Shakespeare says of the king , yonder slip of a boy that rends in the corner feels to be true of himself . " He has failed in the verse because he has thrown a mystical gloss over a thought which was stronger in its simplicity ; because in the verse he states an abstraction instead of giving an instance . The same failure follows him sometimes in prose when be is too conscious of his machinery . Emerson knew that the sense of mystery accompanies the shift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the . preseiit . " There are times when the cawing of a crow , a weed , a snowflake , a boy 's willow whistle , or a farmer planting in his field is more suggestive to the mind than the Yosemite gorge or the Vatican would be in another hour . In like mood , an old verse , or certain words , gleam with rare significance . " At the close of his essay on History he is trying to make us feel that all history , in so far as we can know it , is within ourselves , and is in a certain sense autobiography . He is speaking of the Romans , and he suddenly pretends to see a lizard on the wall , and proceeds to wonder what the lizard has to do with the Romans . For this he has been quite properly laughed at by Dr. Holmes , because he has resorted to an artifice and has failed to create an illusion . Indeed , Dr. Holmes is somewhere so irreverent as to remark that a gill of alcohol will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Emerson ; and Dr. Holmes is accurately happy in his jest , because alcohol does dislocate the attention in a thoroughly mystical manner . There is throughout Emerson 's poetry , as throughout all of the New England poetry , too much thought , too much argument . Some of his verse gives the reader a very curious and subtle inipression that the lines are a translation . This is because he is closely following a thesis . Indeed , the lines are a translation . They were thought first , and poetry afterwards . Read off his poetry , and you see through the scheme of it at once . Read his prose , and you will be put to it to make out the connection of ideas . The reason is that in the poetry the sequence is intellectual , in the prose the sequence is emotional . It is no mere epigram to say that his poetry is governed by the ordinary laws of prose writing , and his prose by the laws of poetry . The lines entitled Days have a dramatic vigor , a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daughters of Time , the hypocritic Days , Maffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes , And marching single in an endless file , Bring diadems and fagots in their hands . To each they offer gifts after his will , Bread , kingdoms , stars , and sky that holds them all . I , in my pleached garden , watched the pomp , Forgot my morning wishes , hastily Took a few herbs and apples , and the Day Tnrned and departed silent . I , too late , Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn . " The prose version of these lines , which in this case is inferior , is to be found in Works and Days : " He only is rich who owns the day . . . . They come and go like muffled and veiled figures , sent from // a distant friendly party ; but they say nothing , and if we do not use the gifts they bring , they carry them as silently away. ** That Emerson had within him the soul of a poet no one will question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are passages in his early addresses which can be mafched in English only by bits from Sir Thomas Browne or Milton , or from the great poets . Heine might have written the following parable into verse , hut it could not have been finer . It comes from the very bottom of Emerson 's nature . It is his uttermost . Infancy and manhood and old age , the first and the last of him , speak in it . " Every god is there sitting in his sphere . The young mortal enters the hail of the firmament ; there is he alone with them alone , they pouring on him benedictions and gifts , and beckoning him up to their thrones . On the instant , and incessantly , fall snowstorms of illusions . He fancies himself in a vast crowd which sways this way and that , and whose movements and doings he must obey ; he fancies himself poor , orphaned , insignificant . The mad crowd drives hither and thither , now furiously commanding this thing to be done , now that . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or act for himself ? Every moment new changes and new showers of deceptions to baffle and distract him . And when , by and by , for an in3tant , the air clears and the cloud lifts a little , there are the gods still sitting around him on their thrones , - they alone with him alone . " With the war closes the colonial period of our history , and with the end of the war begins our national life . Before that time it was not possible for any man to speak for the nation , however much lie might long to , for there was no nation ; there were only discordant provinces held together by the exercise on the part of each of a strong and conscien 237 tious will . It is too much to expect that national character shall be expressed before it is developed , or that the arts shvll flourish during a period when everybody is preoccupied with the fear of revolution . The provincial note which runs through all our literature down to the war resulted in one sense from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , and writings , " says Emerson , " are derivative . We do not write from facts , but we wish to state the facts after the English maniier . It is the tax we pay for the splendid inheritance of English Literature . " But in a deeper sense this very dependence upon Europe was due to our disunion among ourselves . The equivocal and unhappy self-assertive patriotism to which we were consigned by fate , and which made us perceive and resent the condescension of foreigners , was the logical outcome of our political situation . The literature of the Northern States before the war , although full of talent , lacks body , lacks courage . It has not a full national tone . The South is not in it . New England 's share in this literature is so large that small injustice will be done if we give her credit for all of it . She was the Academy of the land , and her scholars were our authors . The country at large has sometimes been annoyed at the self - consciousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual admiration , of isolation , in which all her scholars , except Emerson , have lived , and which notably enveloped the last little distinguished group of them . The circumstances which led to the isolation of Lowell , Holmes , Longfellow , and the Saturday Club fraternity are instructive . The ravages of the war carried off the poets , scholars , and philosophers of the generation which immediately followed these men , and by destroying their natural successors left them standing magnified beyond their natural size , like a grove of trees left by a fire . The war did more than kill // off a generation of scholars who would have succeeded these older scholars . It emptied the uiiiversities by calling all the survivors into the field of practical life ; and after the war ensued a period during which all the learning of the land was lodged in the heads of these older worthies who had made their mark long before . A certain complacency which piqued the country at large was seen in these men . An ante-bellum colonial posing , inevitable in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Washington in the proper attitude for greatness by correcting his spelling , Sparks was in cue with the times . It was thought that a great man must have his hat handed to him by his biographer , and be ushered on with decency toward posterity . In the lives and letters of some of our recent public men there has been a reminiscence of this posing , which we condemn as absurd because we forget it is merely archaic . Provincial manners are always a little formal , and the pomposity of the colonial governor was never quite worked out of our literary men . Let us not disparage the past . We are all grateful for the New England culture , and especially for the little group of men in Cambridge and Boston who did their best according to the light of their day . Their purpose and taste did all that high ideals and good taste can do , and no more eminent literati have lived during this century . They gave the country songs , narrative poems , odes , epigrams , essays , ' novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials from decent and likely sources . They lived stainless lives , and died in their professors ' chairs honored by all men . For achievements of this sort we need hardly use as strong language as Emerson does in describing contemporary literature : " It exhibits a vast carcass of tradition every year with as much solemnity as a new revelation . " The mass and volume of literature must always be traditional , and the secondary writers of the world do nevertheless perform a function of infinite consequence in the spread of thought . A very large amount of first-hand thinking is not comprehensible to the average man until it has been distilled and is fifty years old . The men who welcome new learning as it arrives are the picked men , the minor poets of the next age . To their own times these secondary men often seem great because they are recognized and understood at once . We know the disadvantage under which these Humanists of ours worked . The shadow of the time in which they wrote hangs over us still . The conservatism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in part to that fearful pressure which for sixty years was never lifted from the souls of Americans . That conservatism and timidity may be seen in all our past . They are in the rhetoric of Webster and in the style of Hawthorne . They killed Poe . They created Bryant . Since the close of our most blessed war , we have been left to face the problems of democracy , unhampered by the terrible complications of sectional strife . It has happened , however , that some of the legitimate and authentic tendencies of pure democracy go toward strengthening and riveting upon us the very traits developed by provincial disunion . Wendell Phillips , with a cool grasp of understanding for which he is not generally given credit , states the case as follows : - " The general judgment is that the freest possible government produces the freest possible men and women , the most individual , the least servile to the judgment of others . But a moment 's reflection will show any man that this is an unreasonable expectation , and that , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invariably tend to make the individual subside into the mass and lose his identity in the general whole . Suppose we stood in England // to-night . There is the nobility , and here is the church . There is the trading class , and here is the literary . A broad gulf separates the four ; and provided a member of either can conciliate his own section , he can afford in a very large measure to despise the opinions of the other three . He has to some extent a refuge and a breakwater against the tyranny of what we call public opinion . But in a country like ours , of absolute democratic equality , public opinion is not only omnipotent , it is omnipresent . There is no refuge from its tyranny , there is no hiding from its reach ; and the result is that if you take the old Greek lantern and go about to seek among a hundred , you will find not one single American who has not , or who does not fancy at least that he has , something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or his business , from the good opinion and the votes of those around him . And the consequence is that instead of being a mass of individuals , each one fearlessly blurting out his own convictions , as a nation , compared to other nations , we are a mass of cowards . More than all other people , we are afraid of each other . " If we take a bird's-eye view of our history , we shall find that this constant element of democratic pressure has always been so strong a factor in moulding the character of our citizens , that there is less difference than we could wish to see between the types of citizenship produced before the war and after the war . Much of what Emerson wrote about the United States in 1850 is true of the United States to-day . It would be hard to find a civilized people who are more timid , more cowed in spirit , more illiberal , than we . It is easy to-day for the educated man who has read Bryce and De Tocqueville to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that he felt the atmospheric pressure without knowing its reason . He felt he was a cabined , cribbed , confined creature , although every man about him was celebrating Liberty and Democracy , and every day was Fourth of July . He taxes language to its limits in order to express his revolt . He says that no man should write except what he has discovered in the process of satisfying his own curiosity , and that every man will write well in proportion as he has contempt for the public . Emerson seems really to have believed that if any man would only resolutely be himself , he would turn out to be as great as Shakespeare . He will not have it that anything of value can be monopolized . His review of the world , whether under the title of Manners , Self-Reliance , Fate , Experience , or what - not , leads him to the same thought . His conclusion is always the finding of eloquence , courage , art , intellect , in the breast of the humblest reader . He knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that we have only to throw something off , not to acquire any new thing , in order to be bards , prophets , Napoleons , and Goethes . This belief is the secret of his stimulating power . It is this which gives his writings a radiance like that which shone from his personality . The deep truth shadowed forth by Emerson when he said that " all the American geniuses lacked nerve and dagger " was illustrated by our best scholar . Lowell had the soul of the Yankee , but in his habits of writing he continued English tradition . His literary essays are full of charm . The Commemoration Ode is the high-water mark of the attempt to do the impossible . It is a fine thing , but it is imitative and secondary . It has paid the inheritance tax . Twice , however , at a crisis of pressure , Lowell assumed his real self under the guise of a nom de plume ; and with his own hand he rescued a language , a type , a whole era of civilization from oblivion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His limitations as a // poet , his too much wit , his too much morality , his mixture of shrewdness and religion , are seen to be the very elements of power . The novelty of the Biglow Papers is as wonderful as their worldold naturalness . They take rank with greatness , and they were the strongest political tracts of their time . They imitate nothing ; they are real . Emerson himself was the only man of his times who consistently and utterly expressed himself , never measuring himself for a moment with the ideals of others , never troubling himself for a moment with what literature was or how literature should be created . The other men of his epoch , and among whom he lived , believed that literature was a very desirable article , a thing you could create if you were only smart enough . But Emerson had no literary ambition . He cared nothing for belles-lettres . The consequence is that he stands above his age like a colossus . While he lived his figure could be seen from Europe towering like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are not always like wax which their age imprints . They are often the mere negation and opposite of their age . They give it the lie . They become by revolt the very essence of all the age is not , and that part of the spirit which is suppressed in ten thousand breasts gets lodged , isolated , and breaks into utterance in one . Through Emerson spoke the fractional spirits of a multitude . He had not time , he had not energy left over to understand himself ; he was a mouthpiece . If a soul be taken and crushed by democracy till it utter a cry , that cry will be Emerson . The region of thought he lived in , the figures of speech he uses , are of an int*llectual plane so high that the circumstances which produced them may be forgotten ; they are indifferent . The Constitution , Slavery , the War itBelf , are seen as mere circumstances . They did not confuse him while he lived ; they are not necessary to support his work now that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's voices . He was heard afar off . His foreign influence might deserve a chapter by itself . Conservatism is not confined to this country . It is the very basis of all government . The bolts Emerson forged , his thought , his wit , his perception , are not provincial . They were found to carry inspiration to England and Germany . Many of the important men of the last half-century owe him a debt . It is not yet possible to give any account of his influence abroad , because the memoirs which will show it are only beginning to be published . We shall have them in due time ; for Emerson was an outcome of the world 's progress . His appearance marks the turning-point in the history of that enthusiasm for pure democracy which has tinged the political thought of the world for the past one hundred and fifty years . The youths of England and Germany may have been surprised at hearing from America a piercing voice of protest against the very influences which were crushing them at home . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is a difference in the rate of speed with which revolutions in thought are worked out . While the radicals of Europe were revolting in 1848 against the abuses of a tyranny whose roots were in feudalism , Emerson , the great radical of America , the arch-radical of the world , was revolting against the evils whose roots were in universal suffrage . By showing the identity in essence of all tyranny , and by bringing back the attention of political thinkers to its starting-point , the value of human character , he has advanced the political thought of the world by one step . He has pointed out for us in this country to what end our efforts must be bent .
