txt Our opponents have gVeO gone ligion and have appealed to missionary spmeties and to church ' boards , and told them that the free coinage of silver would leSSen the value of their investments. - Mr. at Ottumwa , Iowa , Oct. i1 . You have " told them " so , Mr. BRYAN , when you have said that under free coinage the purchasing power of the dollar would be " lessened . " You gave them this information on the day before you spoke at , Ottumwa , when you remarked that " the purchasing power of a single dollar will be reduced , " and then referred to the silverite doctrine , so widely proclaimed in the West , that free coinage would take away about 50 per cent . of the dollar 's value , said to have been added unjustly by the legislation pf 1873 . Do you not remember that you have urged the owners of " fixed investments " to sacrifice cheerfully , for the general good and the benefit of " posterity , " the values which would be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by you that the missionary societies have been informed that " their investments. / would be lessened , " while ALTGEIAD , BOIES , and other silverite leaders have told them plainly that half the value would t taken away . Within a few miles of Ottumwa , the Bryanite candidate for Congress in an Iowa district , one GENUNG , has been accustomed to hold up before his audiences a silver dollar cut in halves , and to say : " This is what we are g-oinr. to do with the dollar . We 'll cut it in two , and the plutocrats will have to take one of the pieces for the debts we owe them . If they refuse to accept it , we will compel them . " In the neighboring State of Kansas the same explanation or threat has been made . But who are the plutocrats who own the Kansas farm mortgages ? In 1890 , out of a total of $167,000,000 , residents of Kansas held 45 per cent. , or $75,000,000 , and good local authorities say that they hold a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those whose homes are in the State . Many of them are farmers . In Ohio and Indiana farm mortgages to the amount of $800,000 are held for the benefit of the plutocratic public schools of Connecticut , being a part of that State 's School Fund of $2,100,000 . These can be foreclosed , and the State authorities would so dispose of them 4 BRYAN should be elected . It would be their duty to protect the interests of the school children by reclaiming the dollars loaned before they should be compelled to take dollars worth only half as much . These authorities , as well as the missionary societies and the owners of all " fixed investments , " have been informed by BRYAN and his associates that the value of their invested dollars would be cut down .
