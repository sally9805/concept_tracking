txt It is unfortunate that there should have been so much friction at the fair between the management and the exhibitors , especially the foreign exhibitors . It is impossible to resist the conclusion that this friction has been produced by a lack of tact on the part of the management or of the agents through whom the management operates . In almost every cause of dispute that has arisen , the position of the management seems to be well founded , and such as would be acquiesced in by reasonable and fair-minded persons . But this merely increases the probability that the demands of the management , in themselves proper , have been improperly , if not rudely , urged , since they have been pretty generally resisted by the foreign exhibitors and the foreign officials , their representatives , who are presumably reasonable and fairminded people . Take the last kase of dispute . The managers believe that the list of deadheads is too large , and , indeed , it does seem portentously large , amounting at its highest to very nearly 30,000 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are put upon the footing of paid . admissions and reported as such . The managers accordingly propose to institute an investigation to see - whether all the holders of passes are properly in possession of them . It may and indeed must happen that many persons who had claims to free admission at the opening of the fair have ceased to have such claims , having fulfilled or abandoned the employments upon which their claims were founded , and being now upon the footing of ordinary visitors , while yet they are in possession of photographic passes , which by their terms are good for the whole season . The continued use of these passes in such cases is a fraud on the . fair , which everybody interested in the success of the fair is interested in stopping . The exhibitors , foreign and domestic , are so interested , and if the case were put to them in a proper way it is not to be supposed that they would not cheerfully co-operate in an endeavor to put an end to the abuse . Yet , in fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and insist that the officials shall not go behind the terms of the pass to ascertain whether it was issued on good grounds or whether the grounds on which it was issued remain good .. And in this attitude of resistance they seem to be sustained by their respectbre Commissioners . These facts raise a strong presumption against the manner in which so just and fair a demand has been made upon them . It must have been made in such a way as to incline them to opposition rather than to compliance . This is true of the squabbles of the exhibitors with the Inspectors of Customs , in which the exhibitors were sustained by their Commissioners . Of course , no exhibitor , and even less any national Commissioner , is going to maintain his right to evade the laws of the country in which he is sojourning by smuggling . The explanation is simply that the customs officers acted according to their kind , and we all know that it is a very exasperating kind . The managers of the World 's Fair have no means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such means over men who are in their own employ , and it appears to be highly needful that their powers should be exercised .
