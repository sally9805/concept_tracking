txt The Independent this week will contain the following article by Rear Admiral Sampson on " The United States Navy . " " I have long believed that the navy of the United States is not adequate to the needs of the Nation , and , in spite of our victories , the events of the past year have tended strongly to confirm the view I held before the war began . For an army increase I fail to see the necessity . It is hardly conceivable that we could use a large army except for wars of foreign conquest , which the sentiment of our country would not permit . No power except Great Britain could hope to attack us successfully upon the land . No two powers combined could hope to effect anything against us by sending an army to this country . France and Germany could accomplish little or nothing against us by means of their armies . They have not the necessary naval basis on our coast , they have not the coaling sta.tions , they have not the type of ships that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attempt military operations on a large scale . " Three thousand miles of water protect us from all except one possible enemy ? Great Britain  --  who has of late shown most unmistakably that she desires a permanent peace and the closest friendship . I am extremely glad to see it . Her attitude is all that could be desired . I do not believe that there is any room for doubt as to the good faith of the English . They really wish our friendship , and are prepared to make sacrifices to secure it . It was not always so . For a long time England was the power which appeared most likely to become involved in a war with us . Her conversion to friendship , which seems likely to last and grow stronger , removes the danger of a. fight at close quarters with a. most formidable enemy . " Foreign armies , therefore , do not constitute a danger to this country . The possible wars which confront us are naval wars . and in order to wage them successfully we need more ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ships as our navy at present contains . Whether or not we desire to have it so , the war has made a great change in our position among the nations . They have gained a new estimate of us , and have put us in the front rank of the powers whose voices decide questions of world politics . At the same time we have gee i.tly extended our coast line and have undertaken the government of large and distant territories . We have become en Asiatic power , and can not evade the responsibilities of such a position . We have great interests in the Pacific Ocean , and must be prepared to cope with any who are disposed to deny us our rights there . " To safeguard our interests , to maintain our position , to speak with the authority that becomes us , we need ships , and still more ships . If our easy victories over the fleets of a weak naval power fill our people with the belief that we have now a navy that is large enough for all our needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . I believe In harbor defenses . Every important harbor on the coast should possess its own local defenses , which only determined attack of the enemy could overcome . A foreign fleet could not now make a successful attack upon New York . " The torpedo , the torpedo boat , the mine . the shore gun , played an insignificant part in the late war . But it seems to me that they did not have a fair opportunity to show their merits . I still believe in the torpedo boat , the mine , and the shore battery . If one of our ports had been attacked by a hostile fleet you would probably have seen a result vary different from that which was observed in Manila Bay . " But , granting all that can be claimed for harbor defenses , there still remains with us the necessity for a much larger navy . If a warring nation is to be successful , it must be aggressive . We must be prepared to strike hard blows at a distance from the United States , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By help of the late war , foreigners have discovered in the American Navy many virtues the existence of which there they never suspected . They are ready to concede now that . so far as it goes , ship for ship , it Is quite as good as any upon earth . But with the revelation of these virtues , which we knew all about , came also the revelation of defects , and it becomes us to take note of them . " The praise which the English naval writers have so generously bestowed upon our navy has been mingled with healthy . intelligent criticism , and it will be well for us if we heed it and look over the events of the war in search of warnings and hints for improvements . We have much still to learn about modern warships . They are as yet in the experimental stage . My own idea is that the naval increase should he made by the building of more vessels of the New York type , and that greater speed and coal capacity must be secured , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure them . Our need of swift armored cruisers transcends other naval needs . "
