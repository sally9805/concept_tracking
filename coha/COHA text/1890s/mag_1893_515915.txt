BY JULIAN RALPH . YOUNG AMERICA builds bigger than his forefathers Wyoming is not an exceptionally large State , yet it is as big as the six States of New England and Indiana combined . Indiana itself is the size of Portugal , and is larger than Ireland . It is with more than ordinary curiosity that one approaches Wyoming during a course of study of the new Western States . From the palace - cars of the Union Pacific Railroad , that carries a tide of transcontinental travel across its full length , there is little to see but brown bunch-grass , and yet we know that on its surface of 365 miles of length and 275 miles of width are many mountain ranges and noble river-threaded valleys of such beauty that a great block of the land is to be forever preserved in its present condition as the Yellowstone National Park . We know that for years this had been a stockman 's paradise , the greatest seat of the cattle industry north of Texas - the stamping - ground of the picturesque cowboys who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distant points in Europe to kill big game there . We know that in the mysterious depths of this huge State the decline of its first great activity was , last year , marked by a peculiar disorder that necessitated the calling out of troops ; but that was a flash in a pan , much exaggerated at a distance and easily quieted at the time . For the rest , most wellinformed citizens outside the State know nothing more than the misnaming of the State implies , for the pretty Indian word Wyoming , copying the name of a historic locality in the East , is said to mean " plains land . " Excepting Idaho , it is the newest of the States in point of development . It waits upon the railroads to open it up . The Union Pacific Company has done this for the southern part , but until three years ago no other railway entered the State . Even now the other roads merely tap its eastern and northern edges . The Burlington and Missouri Railroad , of the Chicago , Burlington , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , having come up from Nebraska . It is finished to the Powder River in Sheridan County , and is graded to Sheridan , which is in a region of rich agricultural promise . This railroad must soon , one would think , push on to the Big Horn country , as we shall see . The Fremont , Elkhorn , and Missouri Valley Railroad , of the Chicago and Northwestern system , is also building into the eastern part of the State , and so a beginning is made . But the old-fashioned stage lines are far more numerous than the railroads , and are the sole links between the railways and many interior communities . The State has a population of only about 65,000 , and only one town that is well known all over the country . That , of course , is Cheyenne , long the headquarters of the stockmen of the West , and once a very wild and " wide-open ' city . It is not easy now to see where it stowed its wickedness as one walks its tree-lined streets bordered by pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheyenne has 12,000 population , strong banks , good schools , notable churches some large and enterprising mercantile establishments , a fine park , and a great State capital . The town languishes . Not that the people regret the loss of the dancehouses and gambling lay-outs , but because the vim has gone out of business . The range cattle industry is failing , and the railroads have opened up other centres where mining and agriculture are the chief interests . But Cheyenne is like Wyoming itself , in a transition state , and its future is far more glorious than the noisy , profligate , and unnatural past . The people call their State a second and Western Pennsylvania , because it contains such great stores of coal and iron among many another sort of natural wealth . They are right in asserting that coal and iron such as theirs have been the bases of great wealth for many powerful commonwealths and nations , but we shall see , in making a hasty tour of the State , that a still surer and greater asset is Wyoming 's soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetus to a degree of development that will produce many a thickly settled , prosperous district , where now there is little else than the magic soil itself . It must not be thought that its condi // tions are more primitive than they are , merely because I have called it next to the newest State . There are twenty banks in the State , and nine or ten are national banks ; there are five daily and two dozen weekly newspapers ; there are several scores of settlements , and seven of these are of the grade of cities , and provided with water-works and lighted by electricity . The school system is a thorough one , capped by a free university , and representing a million dollars ' worth of school property . Free public libraries are also maintained there . But it is the future of such a State that is most interesting , and it is the future that we have looked toward throughout this series . The best maps of Wyoming , issued by the Department of the Interior at Washington , are almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " mountain work " in surveying pays better than mapping the plains , this map was heaped with mountains , like the surface of a potful of boiling water , and where there should be a few well-defined chains and parallel valleys , there are more mountains , scattered higgledy-piggledy all over the map , than there are in British Columbia or in Switzerland . To make a tour of the State and see it as it is , let us begin with the northeastern part , that corner which is bounded by South Dakota and Montana . The mountains that are here form the Bear Lodge Rangebroken spurs and isolated mountains not higher than timber grows , and not sufficient in number , extent , or height to produce much water . This is now a great range cattle country , of course . Around the bases of the mountains , where there is an appearance of more moisture than elsewhere , there are great reaches of fine grass land , on the benches and elevated plateaus where the soil seems formed of decomposed gypsum . Big beds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these inviting benches , farming to a considerable extent has crept in , pushed by a population that is thought to be an overflow from Nebraska . There is no market , so the farmers farm only for food for themselves and cattle . Note , however , that they fence in their cultivated land and keep cattle of their own to be fed in the winter . Thus the character of Wyoming and of the stock business both change - quietly , steadily , surely . The agriculture centres around Sundance just now . The stockmen do not consider it a serious invasion of the ranges yet . Cow companies as large as any in the State headquarter to the west of this farming country on the head-waters of the Belle Fourche . The historian of the next decade will , almost surely , write the reverse of this-that agriculture is the mainstay , and cattle deserve a passing notice . Passing along to the middle of the northern part of the State , in Sheridan and Johnson counties-famed as the seat of last year 's " war " between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominating the region . The east slope of these mountains almost duplicates the rich plains country around Denver or Cheyenne . It is more broken , and the ridges between the mountain streams are higher , yet the narrower benches and smaller mesas are of the same fruitful character , well watered by just such sparkling , crystal-like streams as one sees leaping from the sides of the Rockies in Colorado . The Big Horn is a noble range of the Rocky Mountain system . From its tallest point at Cloud Peak , 13,400 feet in air , in the heart of Johnson County , it sinks , in one distinct chain , into nothingness in Montana . Its bold granite knobs and points tower far above timber - line , maintaining a direct northwesterly course with few spurs and side ranges , and with the eastern foothills taking the form of an inclined reach of plains land . Already on this slope , in both counties , agriculture is the principal reliance . This is most true of Sheridan , the border county , because there are still immense herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger percentage of farmers among the people in these counties than anywhere else in Wyoming . It is not that the land is the best . It is very good , indeed , but it owes its advancement in value to the fact that whereas in other parts of the State the big cow companies pre-empted the water , here it was the farmers who took the first claims of land , and water with it . The Burlington and Missouri Railroad , now being pushed to the heart of this region from the Nebraska border , will , before this is printed , connect these farms with Christendom , but up to this time the farming has been only sufficient to satisfy the home demands of an army post , a few villages , and an Indian res // ervation in Montana . Yet it has been enough to prove that the land is sure of a great future . Barley that is said to be as rich as any grown in Canada ; very good wheat , oats , and rye ; luscious big strawberries , fine cherries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common fruits of that zone , except peaches , grow well there . The farm land is between 3800 and 5500 feet above sea-level , and but a small portion of the best of it has been taken up . Westward again , across the Big Horn Mountains , we find a superb country between those mountains and the Yellowstone Park . It is a great basin , walled in on the east by the Big Horns , on the south by the Wind River Mountains , and on the west by the Snake or Shoshone range of the national park . The Big Horn River , a splendid stream , runs northward through this region , on its way to pour its waters into the Yellowstone in Montana . Two large streams  --  the Gray Bull and the Stinking Water-enter it from the west , and the No Wood , a large stream , runs into it from the east ; all these have their own smaller tributaries . The Big Horn , at its best , is 12-i feet deep and 300 feet wide . The arable lands here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - level , and they constitute the largest mass of unoccupied arable land in the State . Much of it is comparatively low , and it is all sheltered by great mountain ranges . It is not a corn country , of course , yet good corn matured there last summer , proving an unlooked-for length of the warm season . Surveys have resulted in determining that there are 172,000 acres of irrigable land on Gray Bull River , that south of this strip is a piece comprising 100,000 acres on th' Big Horn , and that on the Stinking Water there are at least 100,000 acres that can be watered . In addition , there are a dozen large and small streams , on all of which are valley lands capable of irrigation . They are in tracts of varying sizes , but they are bottom lands and good . This Big Horn basin has an apparent measurement on MAP OF WYOMING . // the maps of 7800 square miles , which , considered as a field for the combined industries of farming and cattle-raising , is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest bit of irrigable land along the Gray Bull is a great and uncommon prize for future comers . Not above 500 persons now live in this entire basin . There is a little town , called Otto , near the junction of the Gray Bull and the Big Horn , and there are solitary settlers here and there along the river , as well as a few tiny settlements ( " bunches of houses " theywould say out there ) on the foot-hills in the shadow of the mountains . The basin is , therefore , practically unoccupied . The land is government land , obtainable by homesteaders . One man , who grew forty acres of oats there , succeeded in obtaining sixty-five bushels to the acre , it is said . But there is no market , there is no railroad , and there are no wagonways . The good land of which I have spoken is that near the streams ; the rest of the region is a wilderness of deep gulches , high broken plateaus , sage-brush country , and " bad lands . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of America so desolate now , so inviting to speculation , because it is plain that its future must be grand . How strange a thing it is to be able , after reading the signs of development everywhere in the far West , to point to a vast bowl , unpeopled except by half-wild cattle , and to say , with more confidence than one may prophecy of his own life to-morrow : " Here will come thousands upon thousands of men and women . Here will soon be seen vast areas of land fenced in , set with tidy farm-houses and out-buildings , gay with green and yellow grain , dotted with orchards , lively with teams upon a tangle of wagon roads . Railroads will thread the scene , and somewhere " ( ah ! that would be great prophesying to say just where ) " in this same basin there is certain to arise a city of wealth , size , and importance , with factories and wholesale and retail shops , high-schools , stone churches , parks , and mansions . " Yet it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand will see this basin so peopled that the force of this prediction will even then be lost , for its force lies in the fact that there is nothing of all this in the region to-day . Wyoming is so very new a State that there are many regions very similar to the Big Horn basin in present status and future likelihood . Look on the map . Below this basin is the great Wind River Indian Reservation . This great reserve is practically the same sort of country . Below it , where the Big Horn River is new and slender , is another fine farming country , and one that is already beginning to be settled . The army post-Fort Washakie-on the reservation is a market that has developed a comparatively settled region . The town of Lander is the capital of this small but thrifty section , which is made valuable by reason of the rich but narrow little valleys of the tributaries of the main river-there called the Wind River , though it is the Big Horn none the less . The farms support two flourmills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . West of the Indian reservation and south of the Yellowstone Park is what is called the Snake River Country  --  a very mountainous territory , but with several fine valleys and an abundance of water . Its defect is that the arable land is very elevated . The value of the land has not been determined , but it is superior to its present limited task of growing hay for small holders of cattle who are feeding their stock in corrals in the winter . South of this is the Salt River Valley , at one time an ancient lake-bed , but now a level plain at the bottom of a bowl-a little isolated world among the mountains , and a place of exceeding great beauty . The Mormons , 1500 strong , have pre-empted it all . Originally they began taking quarter sections of 160 acres under the Homestead Law , but later they filed claims for 640 acres at a time under the Desert Land Act . Many of the holders of large tracts are the sons of rich men , but they will find , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in large holdings , but in tracts that a man can grasp , so to speak-twenty to forty acres-on which the owner works , and every inch of which he studies . These thrifty saints have a vast amount of stock in this valley , and produce cheese , butter , and meat , which they ship into the outer world . They raise grain and make flour . Theirs is fine and very productive land , and yet it is more than 6000 feet above sea-level . All of this great belt that I have been describing , south of the Yellowstone Park , is called Uintah County , and at the bot // tom of it is the Bear River Country , which is largely taken up by great cattle corporations . One man in this region owns the river-side land for twenty miles on either side of the Bear River . The main use he makes of this is to grow hay for live-stock , the whole region being principally taken up by great stock-men 's corporations . The Desert Land Act offered a very convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 1120 acres , and it was easy for cow-men to employ their cowboys to file claims upon great tracts . The employers provide the nominal land-office fees and the government price of a dollar and a quarter an acre . This act when it was in force operated in the arid belt , and affected any land that had to be irrigated . The amount upon which a claim can be filed has been reduced to 320 acres , but the principle is very mischievous , because the only hope for a land where soil is plenty and water is scarce is to limit the individual settlers to small holdings , that there may be as many of each as the land will support . Of course these large holdings will in time be broken up , and the region will be thrown open to the multitude . This will happen when the grabbers can make more money by selling the land than by holding it for stock-raising . This is fine farm land in a narrow valley fifty or sixty miles long . Behind this land , on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no use for farming , but which with the farm land forms the happy combination so frequent in Colorado , Montana , Wyoming , and Idaho , by means of which agriculture and stock-raising can be easily and profitably coupled . In the southwestern part of the State is the Green River , a large stream that drains a wide country . This is yet a great stock country , and the farming along the tributary valleys is for hay for the cattle . But times and conditions are changing . The Mormons , for instance , are pouring into the land around Fort Bridger , where there are at least 50,000 acres of irrigable land on half a dozen little streams . The Mormons are single-minded . They want land only to till it . Along the entire southern end of the State there had been but one flour-mill , and that ( at Laramie City ) had failed . As I write , three mills are building : one at Evanston ; one at Douglas , in Converse County ; and one at Saratoga , on the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were four flour-mills in Wyoming in 1890 , but when this is published there will be nine . Moreover , the new mills are of a character and capacity far superior to the first ones . The story of the transformation of Saratoga from a cow outfit to a farming settlement is , in great measure , the same as the story of the transformation of the entire State from a stock-man 's paradise to a nineteenth-century commonwealth . And one such story is worth ten pages of argument and explanation . In the valley of the North Platte River , seven or eight years ago , there were twenty-five herds of cattle , large and small , owned by men or corporations . Fifteen bore the brands of large companies . Then the valley and the country around it were open and unfenced . The soil was uncultivated . The people who lived there bought even the potatoes -- indeed , they bought everything-that they used . Hay , however , was wild , natural , plentiful . They did not know that they could raise anything ; in all probability they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axiom that Wyoming was only fit for grazing ; even to-day there are plenty of stock - owners and store - clerks who say that potatoes and hay are the only forms of vegetation that can be cultivated in the State . The first man in the valley who planted a garden was ridiculed by all the others ; but ridicule will not affect the laws of nature , and as the soil was excellent , his garden was a success . Then others followed suit , all in an experimental , groping way , beginning with potatoes , following with turnips and beets , and so going on through all the grades of general garden truck . At last came experiments with grain , until to-day single fields of wheat and oats comprise 200 or 300 acres , and , as I have said , a thirtybarrel flour-mill is now going up there . So rich is the soil that oats have been grown there to weigh forty-five pounds to the bushel , though the number of bushels to the acre has not been exceptional . The people have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful plant that serves for grass and hay iii the arid region , and already it yields two crops in a summer . The agricultural development is closely associated with the changing of the stockmen 's methods . The Eastern men who had gone into the valley to grow cattle // on the open range had supposed the conditions would for an indefinite period remain as they were , based upon plenty of pasture and water . During the first four years they came gradually to admit that the range business was not profitable . They saw that the first prices they got for their stock were " boom " prices . These depreciated rapidly . Then came a reduction in the range area . Men began to fence for pasture for horses and for winter hay . Each man as he fenced in land also fenced in water , and made it difficult for cattle in the open to get to water . Then settlers began to arrive in numbers , always to locate on water , to fence it in , and to cut off more of the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ; wanting water and food , the animals died to an extent that piled up losses to the owners . At last it was necessary for each cow-man to maintain an outfit of riders through the winters to look after the stock . That was expensive , but it was still more expensive to feed the animals in winter , putting ten-dollar hay into fifteen - dollar beasts , for the hay could be sold for ten dollars a ton . It gradually dawned on the stock-men that they had better have one hundred head of cattle , and care for them well , than keep a thousand , with the risks and cost attendant upon large herds . The big herds were gradually driven out and sold off , and the places of most of the early range operators were taken by men who took up land and staid there with smaller herds , farming as well as beef-raising . The result is peculiar and unexpected . There are as many cattle in the valley as there ever were , but they are owned by a great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against fifteen herds , say , of 2000 heads each , under the range system , there are still 30,000 cattle , but they are in 150 herds of 200 heads . There is only one large cow company left in the valley . It has to keep six or seven riders out in the winter looking after the she-stock . It has to take the precaution , early in each autumn , to make a cow and calf round-up , in order to gather the cows in one pasture and the calves in another , so as to wean the calves . The winter shelter that the cattle get is generally in the natural brush , but it is sometimes necessary to drive them into a long shed , which has had to be put up against the severest storms  --  the crueltyof which is in the winds that rage there . This valley , or rather the range which goes beyond the valley , is sixty by sixty miles in area . The cow company herds 3500 to 4000 head . It has to hire a ranch for growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calf pastures in the winter . Thus is the business now managed by what is spoken of as " the only company that has withstood the revolution in that valley . It will look to the reader , if he knows about the range stock industry , as if the company has its business yet , but the profits of old have vanished . Thus is told the story of the range cattle business in one valley , but it will answer for all Wyoming , since in every other part of the State the same things have happened , are happening , or must happen . The middle southern part of Wyoming is just what it seems from the cars of the Union Pacific Company-of problematical value except for grazing and for its mineral resources . We shall see , farther along , that the mineral resources of most parts of the State are extraordinary . We have now gone over the State in all its parts except the eastern end . A study of the progress of the work of irrigation will lead to a more complete acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed in large areas , which altogether form about 16 ,  - -  000,000 acres . The State comprises about 63,000,000 of acres , and , though more than two-thirds of the area has been surveyed , only 5,000,000 of acres are owned by individuals and corporations , the rest being public land . With so small an amount yielding a revenue , the State has no money with which to develop irrigation ; it is as much as it can do to support a government . The State is very forward in progressive legislation affecting irrigation . Its Constitution declares that the waters within its boundaries are the property of the State . If this principle were acted upon , and the State constructed its own ditches and reservoirs with a single eye to the distribution of the water among the greatest number of landholders , then all that I have urged in other papers upon the other States in the arid belt would here find its consummation . But , having announced the prime fact that it owns the water , it proceeds to give it away . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , but it gives it away , and to men j who want to make money out of it , saying through its officers , " We are only too glad to give it away in order to invite settlers . " Still Wyoming is in advance of its neighbors in even this respect , and too much praise can not be given to its State Engineer , Professor Elwood Mead , whose views are large and practical , who does all that the laws permit toward the conservation of the water supply , and who would make Wyoming 's the best system in the country if he had his way , and if it were not for the mischief that was done before Wyoming became a State . The State has been at the mercy of water-grabbers nearly twenty-one years , but has only enjoyed its own government two years . Under the Territorial system there were no restrictions , and there was no supervision in respect of the distribution of water . Any one who wanted it took it , not as the Mormons have always done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ordinary white men , solely for individual gain . The grabber filed a claim and stated what lie had done and for what purpose he did it , but that was a mere formality . The claims were mainly taken by stockmen who wished to get water on land so that they might utilize great tracts taken under the Desert Land Act . There was a tremendous building of ditches , and some of it was crazy work , as where one company built a $70,000 ditch and only watered 340 acres . Around Lander and a few other places farmers took water for the legitimate uses of farming . Three thousand and eighty-six ditches were run out of 631 streams , and were applicable to 2,172,781 acres under the territorial system . And that is about how the case stands to-day . Now , Wyoming is divided into four grand water districts , to meet as many natural systems of surface drainage . In charge of each district is a superintendent , and these superintendents , with the State Engineer as president ex officio , constitute a Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine causes growing out of the distribution and use of the water . Wyoming alone among all the States in the arid region aims to limit the supply each water-owner may have . This is the next but one most important step that the States in that region must yet take . In the territorial days men built ditches as they pleased , and then thought that they owned all the water such ditches could take . They were obliged to go before the district courts to get decrees validating their claims , and the courts were supposed to see that each claimant took only what water he needed . As a matter of fact , the courts did as they do elsewhere : took an affidavit by the owners as to the capacity of the ditches , without regard to whether such quantities of water had been , were , or could be utilized , and then issued the decrees . Though the machinery of law courts was not calculated to settle those questions the decrees stand , governing 200 of the 3000 ditches of the State , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water of six of'the streams in the State . The new Board of Control has decided that the mere diversion of water from its natural channels shall not constitute appropriation thereof . The water must be applied to some beneficial use , and if that use is irrigation , the water must be actually applied to the land . The new decrees restrict allotments to actual acreage reclaimed - already watered and growing crops . If a ditch is built to reclaim 10,000 acres , and yet is only watering 1000 acres that are cultivated , the board allots the water for that 1000 acres , crediting the owners with water for the other 9000 acres only when such land is cultivated . Where new ditches are built an extension of time for development is made ; in the cases of old ditches , no attention is paid to their future possibilities . In Wyoming , then , the land is reclaimed before the water is parted with by the State . The reader will understand how important and wise this course is when he comprehends the evils that result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , A taps a stream , and runs his ditches as far as he pleases . Then B taps the stream above A , and runs his ditches in the same or another valley or locality . Farming is carried on along both sets of ditches , but when there exists a scarcity of water , A appeals for his priority rights , and gets all the water his ditches will carry . B has his ditches closed , and the orchards and gardens and grain fields along his ditches must die of drought , even though A 's territory may not be all under cultivation , or though he may have twice the water // he needs . Under the Wyoming system priority rights prevail , but only water that is actually benefiting land is at any man 's disposal . It has been determined in Wyoming that a stream of a cubic foot per second shall serve to irrigate seventy acres , but this estimate is considered non-essential there , because every acre which has water can keep it , there being plenty for all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner must have all that he needs , and the second and third corners must follow in their order , but it is said that priority rights have occasioned little trouble so far , owing to the quantity of water , and the fact that the distribution keeps pace with the actual improvement of the soil . The old haphazard water-grabbing freedom of the Territorial days has left its evils , nevertheless . I saw on a map of part of " the Little Laramie Country " a place where 150 ditches paralleled and duplicated one another in land which two ditches would have served thoroughly well . Eventually , when water is not so plentiful , there will be great trouble and expense in watching the head-gates in such localities , to make sure of fair play with the water on hand , and in the mean time there will be great loss from the heating and evaporation of the fluid in so many ditches , nine in ten of which must eventually be abandoned . The surest way to prevent this would be for the State to survey all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there is no law for such a course in any State . Nevertheless , in Wyoming , whenever proposed ditches are palpably unnecessary , permits are refused ; that is to say , if two applications describe one set of lands , the second one is refused until the time set for the completion of the first one has expired . It is estimated that between six millions and seven millions of acres of land in Wyoming are irrigable from the streams . Of the five millions of acres now held in the State only a little above two millions are under ditches . The great majority of the ditches are small ones , and : most of these are owned by stock-men , although a few farming communities operate their own . The stock-men 's ditches will eventually be applied to agriculture . In all , in this baby State , ten millions of dollars or more have been invested in these artificial waterways . When the Board of Control came , with its new rulings , the stock-men as well as the farmers saw that the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their water , and so they have been ploughing their land and seeding it ( for hay at first ) , and thus in the last two years have caused the State to take an extraordinary stride forward in agricultural development . Thus have come the four flouring-mills where there had been none before . Between January , 1891 , and November , 1892 , there were 352 applications for the right to build new ditches , and the State Engineer has been notified that at least one-third of the number have been completed and are in use . Nothing could speak more eloquently of the new forces of civilization and improvement that are at work in the State . These new ditch companies have not been large ones . The experience of the people of the State has been that such corporations should control the settlement of the land , or-as I believe , and the State Engineer adds as an alternative  --  the State should own both the land and the water . The rule is seen to be that when great ditches are built squatters pre-empt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ditch-owners into buying them out . If the State owned the public lands and surveyed them , and encouraged the building of ditches , it could sell the land for its value as improved land , and could reimburse the local ditch company by buying the shares and joining them with the land thus sold until the water and the shares were at an end . Thus even a State with a low and new treasury could prevent the creation of water-barons and avoid the troubles that must come under the grab system of today . A bill has been introduced in Congress for the surrender of the public lands to the State ; but before we can consider this proposition clearly it is necessary to glance at the past and present of the cattle business in this one of its former strongholds . The range cattle business is in a bad way there . One of the shrewdest capitalists in the State , himself a former range cattle owner , told me that not a cow company there made a dollar of profit in 1892 . He afterward corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gained from a new form of the business by men in the northern part of the State who had gone out of the breeding business // and were grazing steers exclusively . This safer method , which discounts the risk to cows and calves , has been widely adopted in Montana and the western end of the Dakotas . The rapid decline of the range business began six years ago . Before that it had been of a character to tempt even the rich . At one time men paid two per cent . a month for money , and made 100 per cent . profits a year . That was when cows came up from Texas at a cost of $7 each , sold in two years for $22 , and in three years for $40 and more , when the ranges were not overstocked , the pasturage was good , and all the conditions , including " boom " prices at the stock-yards , were favorable . The men who did the best pushed into new territory as fast as the Indians were crowded off , and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks soon came , and multiplied . If one man was careful not to overstock a range , he could not be sure that another cow outfit would not do so precisely where he had put his cattle . Prices fell , fences cut up the ranges and shut off the water , winter losses became heavier and heavier , and the " good old days " of this inhuman , devil-may-care , primitive , and clumsy business came to an end . The cowboys of picture and story existed in the brilliant days . At first they had come from Texas , but in the zenith of their romantic glory they came from everywhere and from every class . They included* young Englishmen , college graduates from the East , well-born Americans - all sorts who did not " strike luck " at anything else , and who were full of vim and love of adventure . They got $40 a month and good keep during the greater part of each year . They rode good horses , that had as much of the devil in them as the " boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits that were as ornate as jewelry , and stuck their feet in grand tapadcros , or hooded stirrups , richly ornamented , padded with lamb 's wool , and each as big as a fire-hat . Their spurs were fit for grandees , their " ropes , " or lariats , were selected with more care than a circus tight-rope , and their big broad felt sombreros cost more than the Prince of Wales ever paid for a pot-hat . And then , alas ! the cow-men began to economize in men , food , wages-everything . The best of the old kind of cowboys , who had not become owners or foremen saloon-keepers or gamblers , or had not been shot , drifted away . Some of the smartest among them became " rustlers " - those cattle-thieves whose depredations resulted in what almost came to be a war in Wyoming last year . They insisted that they had to do it to live . From the cowboy stand - point it was time for the business to languish . Towns were springing up every here and there , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they entered the villages ; wages were low down ; men had to cart hay and dump it around for winter food ; settlers fenced in the streams , and others stood guard over them with guns : it was time such a business languished . From the stand-point of nineteenth-century civilization the same conclusion was reached  --  the range business was an obstruction to civilization , a bar to the development of the State , a thing only to be tolerated in a new and wild country . And now I am assured that there is not an intelligent cow-man who does not know that the business is doomed in Wyoming . and that the last free-roving herds must move on . There is not one who does not know that small bunches of cattle , held in connection with agriculture , must take the places of the range cattle , because better grades of cattle can be bred , better meat can be produced , all risks will nearly disappear , and the expenses of the care of the cattle will not be a tithe of those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-discussed plan for having Wyoming intrusted with the public domain within her borders . This plan takes account of the fact that she will ever be a great cattle - raising State . The plan is to sell the agricultural or arable land in connection with the water and with the upper or range land , always combining the irrigable bottoms or mesas and benches with the higher unirrigable territory . Then farmers may grow hay with one hand , so to speak ( along with whatever else they choose to plant&gt;. , while with the other they look after their cattle . With thoroughbred bulls , sheltered winter pasture and feed and an income from farming , the farmers will be rich and the beef will be the finest that it is possible to produce . There is an unexpected opposition to this project , and by the men most certain to be benefited were it carried out . They are ignorant and suspicious , and fear that the plan // cloaks some effort toward a land-grabbing monopoly or steal of some sort . Nevertheless , the plan is peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that matter , in Colorado and other States , in the arid belt . It turns to good account land of a sort that is all too plentiful there that it is not easy to employ otherwise , and that is not attractive or profitable as pasture-land for cattleowners other than such as own farms in the neighborhood . For such it should be held against wild cattle , and against the devouring bands of sheep that otherwise might and often would pass over the hills and leave them as bare as the back of one 's hand . The number of cattle in the State in 1892 was estimated to be 428,823 , and the value of the stock was considered to be $4,654,379 , but I was told that the State never gets reports of more than six-tenths of the number actually within her borders . However , in 1886 the number reported was 898,121 head , or more than twice as many as now , and then cows were considered worth $16 31 apiece as against $10 50 now . But this falling off argues no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the range cattle industry thrive . The auditor 's figures show that while there has been a decrease of ten millions of dollars in the valuation of the cattle in the State within seven years , the total assessable value of properties in Wyoming has increased $1,236,713 during that period . The reports of horses indicate that there are 78,286 of them on the ranges , and these are computed to be worth $2,681,000 ; but this is also an untrustworthy item . Iu truth , there are no less than 100,000 head of horses , and many of them are of excellent stock . Sheep exceed all other animals in numbers . The auditor reports 639,205 , and there are really close to 900 ,  - -  000 of these animals on the ranges . They are worth , at graded values , $1,750,000 . Wherever the cow business is carried on there exists the most fanatical prejudice against sheep and sheep - herders . The English language fails every cowman who tries to express his opinion about this sister industry . This is worth recording here , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from British Columbia to Texas , and because it is a prejudice without warrant or base , and it is bound to die out . We shall see why , after telling what a cow-man said of it when I brought up the topic in Wyoming : " The sheep-herder is the worst blot on the State , " said he . " He is no good , and much harm . He may have his office in New York , Chicago , or London . He fits out a wagon , with a Mexican and a dog and several thousand sheep , and away they go , like an Egyptian scourge , eating the grass down to the ground , and , in sandy soils , trampling it down so that there are great regions where once the bunch- grass grew knee - high , but where the country is now bare as a desert . You might search acres in such a place with a microscope and not discover an ounce of grass . These people pay no rent , do n't own an acre , send their profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the State . " But new men are constantly drifting into the sheep business , and mutton , which always hung back in the meat markets of America , is coming to be a favorite meat , as it is in England . There is no more remarkable change in our country than this general turning toward mutton after it had been so long and generally disliked . Men who harbored the same ill will toward the business of sheep-herding , are now rushing into it because of the money there is in it . He who was always spoken of on the ranges as " that - sheepman , " is now on top , the subject of the envy of his neighbors . It is not true that the sheep are largely owned by foreigners or outsiders . The three largest sheep-herders in Wyoming are residents of the State . In Carbon County , the largest sheep county in the State , 138,438 sheep are ranging , and they are owned at home . The manner of conducting the business , and the figures of the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand sheep are considered a good holding , because that number divides into two herds convenient to handle . The owner of such a bunch will employ three men-two herders and a foreman , who is also the " camp-mover . " Each herd will have a wagon , a man , and a dog , or usually two dogs . The wagon in use on the ranges is the typical " schooner " of olden time - a heavy box on wheels , covered with a canvas top , and appointed with a bed in the back , a locker , and a stove . The camp-mover divides his time between the two herds . He has a team of horses , // and after he has moved one wagon and herd to new pasture , he leaves that outfit and goes off , perhaps fifteen or twenty miles , to the other herd , to find new pasture for that , and to leave it till the grass is nipped close . The sheep are not exclusively grass-eaters . They like to browse on brush and the bark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " browse which is the short white sage - brush of that region . It is estimated that it costs seventy cents a head to maintain a herd , but the wool greatly more than meets this expense . The herders sell the old ewes to feeders in Nebraska and elsewhere to fatten for market , getting $3 50 to $4 a head for such stock . Occasionally , if they think the herds are increasing in numbers too fast , they sell off a bunch of young lambs , and yearlings fetch as high as $2 75 a head . The profits lie in the increase of the animals by multiplication . This amounts to almost a doubling of the herds in a year , the percentage being between 75 and 100 per cent . At an average cost of $3 50 for stock sheep , and a doubling of the animals , with sales at $2 75 to $4 , and with an additional margin from the wool , after expenses are met , it is plain that the business is not a bad one . Wool has fetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and good sheep yield about nine pounds as an average clip . The coal and iron of Wyoming form a wonderful treasure . Unlike nearly all the other far Western States , Wyoming 's settlement was not connected with mining . The first actual settlements were around forts Laramie and Bridger . Gold was discovered on the route of the old trail in 1867 , and there have been many mining flurries in the State since then but these were as nothing to those which built up the neighboring States , or to what must yet draw millions from this one . It was the extension of the cattle business that lifted Wyoming into prominence , and yet it will not do to say that this led to the State 's settlement , since that was an industry which rather obstructed than fostered the development of the territory . Yet the rocks and the earth bear treasures comparable with those of any State in our West . Coal is found in every county . From the northern centre to the eastern end of the State it is a lignite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It outcrops frequently and gen erally . It is in use in the towns of Sheridan and Buffalo , and is found to burn very well . Near Buffalo there is a vein that is said to be seventy feet thick . The nearer this deposit approaches the mountains , where it has been subjected to more pressure , the more commercial value it has . The coal burned in the settlements around Bonanza , in the western part of Johnson County , is so free from sulphur and phosphorus that it can he used by blacksmiths . Close to the Montana border the same good bituminous coal that is found in that State extends its field into Wyoming . In the eastern part of the State , where the Black Hills enter from South Dakota , is Newcastle , a busy coalmining town , whose neighborhood is richly veined with a bituminous coal that makes high-grade coke . Coking ovens supply that material for the Black Hills smelters . This is the only coal of the kind in the State , . It is of such quality that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mining 800 tons a day for that use and for sale along the line in other localities . The next best deposit yet mined is at Rock Springs , in Sweetwater County , in the southwestern part of the State , and on the Union Pacific Railroad . More than a million tons were shipped from this immense field last year . It is the best soft coal in the Wyoming markets , and as good as any in the West . The Union Pacific Railroad is heavily interested here , but there are some small private mines . In order that the people of the State may have no rose without its thorn , and may not grow too proud of their good fortune , this coal is sold in Cheyenne at $6 a ton . From Rawlins , to the eastward , comes a good coal , and eastward again is the Carbon coal field , where the railroad also owns producing mines . This coal is not so good as that from Rock Springs , and sells at thirty-five cents less per ton . Away down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , from one of which the Southern Pacific Railroad Company gets its supply . It is a lower grade than the Rock Springs coal . The Fremont , Elkhorn , and Missouri Valley Railroad ( Chicago and Northwestern system ) came into Wyoming for coal , among other reasons , and has a large mine in the Platte River field , near Fort Fetterman . This is not a good locomotive or steam coal , but finds a ready market in Nebraska // and elsewhere along this gigantic system . There are at least half a dozen large coal fields in the central belt of counties of whose merits I find no mention in my notes . Their development doubtless awaits that of the country around them . Iron is as plentiful . First in importance is the great district around Hartvi le , north of Fort Laramie . It is theoretically pure hematite-as nearly so as hematite is found , and it has been developed or mined sufficiently for the owners of the present mines to be confident of its value . Duluth and Eastern capital has been invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railway connection with the Skull Creek ( Newcastle ) coal mines . Next in promise are the Seminoe , Carbon County . mines to the northwestward of the Carbon coal fields . Here is plenty of fine hematite , with fuel and fluxes close by , and only transportation facilities needed . There is a large soft deposit of mineral paint ( oxide of iron ) , which is being ground and readily marketed . It has been found to be excellent for painting freight cars , iron and tin roofs , and buildings , is a valuable wood - preservative , and retains its color longer than most paints . The Chugwater River runs through an immense field of iron ore , but it is impregnated with what is called titanium . Iron carbonate ore is found in the Big Horn Basin , and in the basin east of the South Powder River . This will be mined , in time , for use in Bessemer steel making . The tin of the Black Hills extends into Wyoming . The State has some extraordinary soda deposits , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found all along the North Platte River . Lead appears at least twice in large quantities in a survey of the State , and kaolin , fire-clay , mica , gi-aphite , magnesia , plumbago. and sulphur are more or less abundant . Gypsum is found in almost every county , and plaster of Paris is being made of it at Red Buttes , on the Union Pacific Railroad . Marbles-some of them very fine and beautiful-are being gathered in every county for exhibition at the World 's Fair in Chicago . They are of all colors ; but the only white marble is found in the Sibylee region , where , by-the-way , is another undeveloped agricultural section of great promise . The granites of the State are very fine , and the sandstones , which are of unlimited quantity , include beauti ful varieties for building purposes and for interior decorative woi-k . Petroleum appears in several places in the State . There are wells at Salt Creek in Johnson County . The Omaha Company have flowing wells at Bonanza in another part of the county , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a splendid illuminant . A mile away is a spring carrying oil on its surface . Near Lander , south of the Indian reservation , are more than two dozen borings . All have flowed , and all are now cased , but there is a three-acre lake of leakage from them . There are signs of oil elsewhere in the State . The oil production and supply of this county are controlled by one company . If any other company offers to compete with this giant concern , it would be possible for the master company to give oil away until the opposition was starved out . The money of the great company is in its by-products , and it would not suffer greatly by making a free gift of all the oil that is consumed in Wyoming . It is generally believed that the controllers of the oil supply look to the wells of Colorado to piece out the supply if the Pennsylvania wells fail . After that , or at that time , perhaps , humanity will be interested in the oil of Wyoming ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , and interests still less capital . Gold is still being mined where it was first found , below the Indian reservation in the South Pass district . Here is both lode and placer mining , but the principal placer - owner is working the quartz . Within the past year many new mines have been opened there , and one shipper claims to be getting from $200 to $400 a ton out of his ore . Another gold disti-ict is east of this on the Seminoc Mountains . Others are on both sides of the Medicine Bow range , southwest of Laramie city , and near the Colorado line ; in the Black Hills , in the Little Laramie Valley , in the Silver Crown district , and in the Big Horn country . The gold-mining in the State is sufficiently promising to interest a great many miners and considerable capital ; but the best friends and best judges of the new State see the richest future for her in the development of her splendid agricultural lands first , and next in her coal and iron fields . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of the consti // tutions they have adopted as the bases of their governments . In Montana , for instance , the Constitutional Convention comprised an assemblage of men who , it is said , would win distinction anywhere . Wyoming 's convention may not have been so notable in its make-up , but its product , the Constitution , is very remarkable . It is fin de si*icle , if I may apply French to anything so extremely American ; it is thoroughly " up to date . " Wyoming had progressed under Territorial government for twenty years , when , in January , 1888 , her Legislature memorialized Congress for an enabling act , in the belief that Territorial government retarded the progress and development of the region . The Congress committee to which the matter was referred reported it favorably , as it also did a bill preparing for the admission of the other Territories which were so soon to become full-fledged members of the Union . In June , 1889 , the Governor , Chief Justice , and Secretary districted the Territory , and apportioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the Governor directed that an election be held in July to choose delegates to a constitutional convention in September . Fifty-five delegates composed the convention , and drafted the Constitution , which was afterwards ratified by a vote of five-sixths of the citizens . Wyoming was admitted as a State in 1891 . In its declaration of rights the Constitution perpetuates the right of the women to vote as they had been doing when Wyoming was a Territory . " Since equality in the enjoyment of natural and civil rights , " it declares , " is made sure only through political equality , the laws of this State affecting the political rights and privileges of its citizens shall be without distinction of race , color , sex , or any circumstance or condition whatsoever , other than individual incompetency or unworthiness duly ascertained by a court of competent jurisdiction . Article VI. , entitled " Suffrage , " farther declares that " the right of citizens to vote and hold office shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex . Male and female citizens of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious rights and privileges . " The age when a citizen may vote is fixed at twenty-one equally without regard to sex , but " no person shall have the right to vote who shall not be VOL . LXXxvu. - No. 517-8 able to read the Constitution of the State " ( physical disability in this respect being no bar ) . The method of voting is what is generally called " the Australian system . " The situation in Wyoming is especially interesting , because women cut a small figure in a new State , and what they have got there the men must have given them . Do they vote -- now that they may ? How many vote ? Do they vote as their husbands do or tell them to ? Is the voting of women mainly done by the respectable , th' intelligent , the ignorant , or the disorderly classes ? To what extent , if any , do the women study politics and statecraft in order to vote intelligently ? I am drifting to one side of a study of Wyoming 's Constitution , but these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , when I put these queries , here and there , I said " women " whenever I spoke of that sex , for which I have the highest respect  --  the most sentimental , if you please . But I never heard any other man in the State apply any other word to the better sex except the much-abused and demoralized term " ladies . " That is a marked peculiarity of the language in the West . It does not contain the noble word " woman . " It sickens the ear with the overuse of the word " lady . " For my part , I know a woman when I see one , but I find it difficult to determine ladyhood except upon hearsay or acquaintance . When I do find it I compliment it with the dignified word " woman " ; a statement which I hope will free me from even a suspicion of rudeness or lack of gallantry here and in what follows . I found that the great majority of the women in Wyoming are in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands do , and , as one official expressed himself , " good men pride themselves upon not influencing their wives . " Yet it is true , I am told , that very many women , of their own volition and unconsciously , copy the politics of their husbands . Occasionally the men of the State hear of women who refuse to embrace the privilege , who do not believe that women should meddle in affairs which concern the homes , the prosperity , and the self-respect and credit of the communities of which they are a part ; but such women are , of course , few . // On the other hand , other women are very active in politics . There is a Ladies ' Republican League among the political clubs of Cheyenne . It is seen that the right to vote acts as an incentive to study the principles and records of the opposing parti*s , and if there are women who blindly vote as their husbands do , there are yet others who fail to agree with the views of their life companions upon public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take an active part in politics , a few resort , to the stump , and speak for whichever cause they have adopted . But there are many who serve side by side with the men as delegates to conventions and voters in the party primaries . In the last State convention of the Republicans there were three women delegates ; in that party 's last county convention , in Laramie County , the secretary was a woman , and three delegates were of her sex . Women literally flock to the primaries - in the cities , at all events . At the primary meeting in the Third Ward of Cheyenne last autumn , out of 183 who were present at least 80 were women . In the other wards the proportion of women was as one is to three . On election days the women go a-voting precisely as they go a-shopping elsewhere . On foot or in their carriages they go to the polls , where , under the law , there are no crowds , and where all is quiet and orderly . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their manners . All sorts and every sort of women vote ; but it is to be remarked that this affords no criterion for larger and Eastern States , since the proportion of women of evil lives is very small in Wyoming , even in the cities , and , so far as other women are concerned , our new States are nearer like democracies than our old ones . The lines of caste are more apt to be noticed by their absence than by their enforcement . To return to the Constitution so remarkable if only because of this recognition of woman 's equality to man : it forbids imprisonment for debt except in cases of fraud ; it guarantees liberty of conscience , hut declares that such liberty " shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of the State . " ( A notice to the Mormons , who are already forming colonies there . ) It provides that " no money of the State shall ever be given or appropriated to any sectarian or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the greater the truth the greater the libel , " receives its quietus , so far as Wyoming is concerned , in this clause : " Every person may freely speak , write , and publish on all subjects , being responsible for the abuse of that right ; and in all trials for libel , both civil and criminal , the truth , when published with good intent and for justifiable ends , shall be a sufficient defence , the jury having the right to determine the facts and the law under direction of the court . " And here is a truly modern clause : " The rights of labor shall have just protection through laws calculated to secure to the laborer proper rewards for his service and to promote the industrial welfare of the State . " ( The italics are mine . ) " No power , civil or military , shall at any time interfere to prevent an untrammelled exercise of the right of suffrage . " No distinction shall ever be made by law between resident aliens and citizens as to the possession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perpetuities and monopolies arc contrary to the genius of a free State , and shall not be allowed . Corporations being creatures of the State , endowed for the public good with a portion of its sovereign powers , must be subject to its control . " Water being essential to industrial prosperity , of limited amount , and easy of diversion from its natural channels , its control must be in the State , which , in providing for its use , shall equally guard all the various interests involved . " The State of Wyoming is an inseparable part of the Federal Union , and the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land . " No session of the Legislature after the first , which nmay be sixty days , shall exceed forty days .... No Legislature shall fix its own comliensation . " ( The sessions are biennial . ) " No bill before the Legislature , except general appropriation bills , and bills for the codification and general revision of the laws , shall be passed containing more than one subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any subject is embraced in any act which is not expressed in the title , such act shall be void only as to so much thereof as shall not be so expressed . " No appropriation shall be made for charitable , industrial , educational , or benevolent purposes to any person , corporation , or community not under the absolute control of the // State " ( nor to any sectarian or denominational institution , as we have seen ) . The provisions to prevent bribery and corruption in the Legislature are intended to be especially finely drawn . No legislator may give his vote or influence for or against any measure in consideration of the promise of another legislators s influence in favor of or against any other measure before , or to be brought before the Legislature . To make such a proposition is declared to be " solicitation of bribery " ; to carry out such a bargain is to be guilty of bribery . Witnesses may be compelled to testify in trials of such causes , and shall not withhold testimony on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but such testimony may not afterward be used against such witnesses , except upon a charge of perjury in giving such testimony . " A member who has a personal or private interest in any measure or bill proposed or pending before the Legislature shall disclose the fact to the House of which he is a member , and shall not vote thereon . " " All fines and penalties under general laws of the State shall belong to the public-school fund of the respective counties . " This is in addition to the usual two sections in each township , to all lands given to the State for purposes not otherwise specified , the proceeds of all property that may come to the State by escheat or forfeiture , and in addWion to all funds from unclaimed dividends or distributive shares of the estates of deceased persons . " In none of the public schools shall distinction or discrimination be made on account of sex , race , or color . " No sectarian instruction , qualifications , or tests shall be imparted , exacted , applied , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required at any religious service therein , nor shall any sectarian tenets or doctrines be taught or favored in any public school or institution that may be established under this Constitution . " Railroad and telegraph lines heretofore constructed , or that may hereafter be constructed in this State , are hereby declared public highways and common carriers , and as such must be made by law to extend the same equality and impartiality to all who use tWem , excepting employees and their families and ministers of the Gospel . " Exercise of the power and right of eminent domaiu shall never be so construed or abridged as to prevent the taking by the Legislature of property and franchises of incor porate ( l companies , and subjecting them to public use the same as property of individuals . " No street passenger railway , telegraph , telephone , or electric-light line , shall be constructed within the limits of any municipal organization without the consent of its local authorities .

" ( Condensed to give the mere substance of the clause . ) " No armed police force or detective agency , or armed body or unarmed body of men , shall ever be brought into this State for the suppression of domestic violence , except upon the application of the Legislature , or Executive , when the Legislature can not be convened . " The laws governing taxation and revenue are equally notable . Except for the support of educational and charitable institutions , and the payment of the State debt and interest thereon , the annual levy may not exceed four mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of the property in the State . Twelve mills on the dollar is the maximum levy in the counties for all purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual and additional tax of two dollars for each person in each county is imposed for school pui'poses . No city or town may levy a tax greater than eight mills on the dollar , except to meet its public debt and the interest thereon . It will be seen that in preparing this great establishment for the reception of future millions , the furniture is as complete as the variety of attractions in the soil , and the future millions will find , already settled for them beforehand , many of the problems which we in older States are sorely troubled to decide-such as the female suffrage question , the eight-hour law , the Pinkerton problem , the question of religion or no religion in the schools , the mischief of discrimination in freight rates , and the evil of free passes on railways , with fifty other greater or lesser matters that foment doubt and contention far to the eastward of this forward and vigorous commonwealth , which thus has everything it needs , except the trifle called population .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
