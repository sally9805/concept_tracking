txt The syndicate which secured the entire issue of $50,000,000 in Government bonds last month formally dissolved yesterday . The syndicate had intended to keep $20 , - 000,000 of the bonds and to sell $30,000,000 . It sold $10,500,000 . The remaining $19,500 , - 000 will be divided among the members , according to their subscriptions . They will thus have for their own investment or disposal nearly four-fifths of the loan , instead of two-fifths , as they had planned . The market would not take the others . Drexel , Morgan &; Co. made the announcement of dissolution in the following card : The action of the United States Treasury on currency questions having stopped progress in the sale of bonds for the account of the 5 per cent . bonds syndicate , and the period of thirty days mentioned in the notice of the United States Treasury having expired , the syndicate is dissolved . The syndicate had been organized for thirty days . Its agreement would thus have expired yesterday by limitation . Members of the syndicate were reluctant to go beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John A. Stewart , its organizer and President of the United States Trust Company , said : The syndicate was formed for a specified time , and that time having expired , the syndicate dissolves . All the bonds have not been sold , on account of the fall in the price below the figures at which they were Purchased . I do n't wish to criticise Mr. Carlisle , but it is evident that his currency ' plans have operated to depreciate the bonds . Harvey Fisk &; Son , the selling agents of the bonds , said through one of their firm : There were ** of the bonds originally . Of this amount $20,000,000 were withdrawn for investment , and $30,000,000 were syndicated for the market . Of the syndicated amount , 25 per cent . has been sold around 110 , and the remaining 65 per cent . are in the hands of the various members of the syndicate . They will gradually find a market , perhaps : and perhaps , again , some of them will never be sold The reason why the bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency plans , killed off the market for national bonds . In private some of them were much less mild in their comments . They . felt that plans under which they had subscribed had been spoiled , and that whatever may have Seen understood at Washington regarding those plans , the movement officially sustained there to load the market with Government bonds by ' releasing the bond deposits of national banks was responsible for upsets here . It had been the syndicate 's wish , having bought the bonds at 111.011 , to sell part of them at retell at a profit . No difficulty was experienced in disposing of $5,000,000 at 110 . Then the syndicate advanced the price to 1191A , at which sales were so slow that 119 was restored , and $5,030,000 additional found market . Demand ceased with the announcement of the plan to change the form of national bank security , thus possibly freeing $200 , - 000,000 of bonds now under lock . Prices declined in the market until Sc were offered below 118 , and buyers showed no eagerness for them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept almost any reason for a movement in securities , seems really to have been influenced less by the remote possibility of legislation that might throw old bonds out for sale than by the prospect of another fresh supply this Winter . Whatever doubt may have been felt in this regard one month ago has been removed by the rapid depletion of the gold reserve . With the chance of getting bonds on a basis close to 3 per , cent . bond buyers saw no reason why they should buy of the syndicate on a basis of 2.7 per cent . or less . Bankers do not anticipate a further break at present in the price of bonds . They think the market has fully discounted all prospects . The syndicate needs no sympathy for failing in a scheme for profit , and asks none . Such serious view as was taken of the terms of the syndicate 's card was based on apprehension that the next bond issue might not be so easily subscribed as was the recent one , unless it may be deferred long enough to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of the syndicate can easily carry their unexpected holdings , via embarrassment can come on that account . It is believed , also , that the bonds thus apportioned will find ready market with investors as soon as affairs in national finance shall quiet a little . Bankers have said all along that if the Treasury were to release the national bank bonds , the banks would not throw them on the market , but would keep them for investment , unless they could be advantageously sold . A dispatch from Washington last night said that the syndicate had called for only $ ? 0,000,000 of the $50,000,000 issue , although all had been paid for . The undelivered portion draws interest , and is held subject to the syndicate 's order .
