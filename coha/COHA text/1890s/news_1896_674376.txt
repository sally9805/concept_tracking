txt Fire yesterday morning entirely destroyed the handsome wood and stone dwelling occupied by Duncan Elliott on the grounds of the Westchester Country Club , near Westchester Village . The fire was discovered about 9 o'clock in the morning , and at nightfall , despite the efforts of the Westchester Fire Department , only the stone foundations and two tall chimneys were left standing . The fire is supposed to have been due to a defective flue of the furnace in the basement . So quickly did the flames spread that the occupants of the house had barely time to escape with their lives . Julian Potter , a guest , to save himself was forced to jump from the second-story window , and last night he lay at the Country Club with two broken ribs and other supposed internal injuries . The burned mansion was owned by Stephen Duncan Marshall , a member of the club , who now lives at Bartow. it stood upon a slight eminence a little distance to the left of the main entrance to the Country Club 's grounds . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of country houses . The basement was divided into a laundry , wine closets , a storeroom , and a room in which was placed a hot-air furnace and bins for storing wood and coal . The house was occupied by Duncan Elliott , his wife , and two small children , and a force of servants . Julian Potter , a brother of E. C. Potter , and a nephew of Bishop Potter , was there as a guest for Christmas week . Yesterday morning being Sunday , the majority of the servants attended church . Mr. Elliott was away from the house and there remained only Mrs. Elliott , who was asleep in her room , at the northeast end of the second story : Mr. Potter , who occupied a room at the southwest end ; the cook , the butler , John Miles ; Maria Flynn , Mrs. Elliott 's maid , and two nurses , who were with the two children in the nurseries , in the south end of the second story . One Of the servants happened to go down into the basement about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flame and smoke . Miles , the butler , immediately telephoned the Country Club for aid , while Maria Flynn went to arouse the inmates . When Mrs. Elliott was awakened , she had only time to throw on a dressing gown and slippers before she was forced to leave . The nurses in the meantime had removed the children to a place of safety . Mr. Potter did not at first appreciate his danger . When " he did , he found all escape by the hallways cut off by the fire . He had no other recourse but to jump from the window . - The height from the ground was . not over twelve or fifteen feet , but in jump -- ing- his foot caught a projecting stone , and he was turned in the air . When picked up from the ground he was partially unconscious and appeared to be suffering intensely . A physician was summoned and found that , in addition to two broken ribs , Mr. Potter may have received more serious internal injuries . Maria Flynn , who had aroused the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs , and so took refuge on the balcony of the second story . She was rescued by the firemen . At the Country Club , upon receipt of the butler 's telephone message , an alarm was sent to the Westchester Fire Department . They arrived on the grounds some time near 10 o'clock . The department has no fire engine , so its hose was attached to fire plugs and dependence put upon the regular pressure of the water . With these facilities the firemen were unable to do anything save to prevent the stables from catching fire . Mr. and Mrs. Elliott and the children went to the home of Mrs. Butler Duncan , Mr. Potter was taken to the Country Club , while the servants were disposed of in various quarters . Mr. Elliott , in speaking of the fire lest night , said that when he returned home , the fire was already under good headway . It was impossible for him to enter the house on account of the dense smoke . How it started he did not know positively , but supposed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace . Mr. Elliott severely criticised the work of the Fire Department . " They used only one hose on the house , " he said , " until it was nearly in ruins . They were absolutely inefficient . There seemed to be no head , and the few men there appeared to have no conception of what should be done upon an occasion of that kind . " The house , according to Mr. Elliott , was valued at $30,000 , while the furniture and clothing was worth nearly as much mare . Everything was partially insured , but to what amount Mr. Elliott was unable to say . Maria Flynn , the maid , said that none of the servants saved any clothing , whatever . She had escaped suffocation while running through the halls by wrapping a shawl around her head , BREWERY STOREHOUSE BURNED . moned , - and when the company arrived the building was in flames . The Captain seeing the dangerous nature of the fire , immediately turned in three more alarms in rapid succession , and soon the eighteen engines called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotion among the firemen of Queens County . In the course of time the twelve available engine companies of Queens County began arriving at the conflagration  --  only to find the hydrants frozen stiff . The Maspeth company had a lookout . He saw the flames of the burning buildings , and got the entire company together . They watched the fire , but they could not go , because no alarm had been sent in to their house . For fully thirty minutes the firemen watched the flames mount upward from the repair shop , and then reach over the street and lick up the big four-story warehouse . They were excited , but discipline and precedent prevailed ; they could not move because no alarm had ' come . Finale , the bell tapped , and they started , arriving at the fire only to find the last available hydrant frozen stiffer , if anything , than the others . A sufficient amount of water was found on the Brooklyn side of the line , and there was need for all of it . The flames from the tarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before the firemen could get their hose out , the strong northwest wind blowing had fanned the blaze clear to the fourth story of the warehouse , and the flames , once gaining a foothold , baffled all attempts to subdue them until they had enveloped the building . The people who watched the repair shop burn were treated to an electrical display not often witnessed . Wires were burning and snapping in every direction . They exploded with loud reports and curled up in all sorts of fantastic shapes , darting forked lightning about in such a way that the firemen were forced ' 0 fight the flames at a. respectful distance . Superintendent Gordon of the Brooklyn Heights Road was on hand early , and materially assisted the firemen in having the wires tied up and kept out of the way . When the fire was nearly over , three firemen were injured . They were standing on a ladder , which was leaning against the storehouse , not far from a big chimney . Suddenly a warning shout was raised , and the men , expecting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Patrick Slavin of Engine 34 was picked up , badly bruised and internally injured . He was taken to St. Catherine 's Hospital . Both buildings were completely gutted . In the cellar of the storehouse the water was eight feet deep , entirely covering 400 barrels of beer stored there . At 6 o'clock the last city engine had picked up , but the Newtown Department , otherwise . known as the Queens County Fire Department , had gone home hours before . Brooklyn Fire with a Loss of *70,000 and Three Firemen Mart . The liveliest fire for many a day in the Eastern District of Brooklyn broke out shortly after noon yesterday in the repair shop of the Bushwick Division of the Brooklyn Heights Railroad Company , situated in the block bounded by Myrtle , St. Nicholas , and Gates Avenues , and Wyckoff Streets , in Ridgewood . With unusual rapidity it spread through the entire structure , and jumped across the street to the big four-story frame storehouse of Welz &; Zeriveck 's Brewery , and consumed it together with 400 bales of hops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was about e30,000 . Welz &; Zerweck estimate their loss at from $40,000 to . $50,000 . The repair shop is a one-story building , . just over the city line . Owing to the fact that it had a tar roof and that the interior was saturated with grease and oil , it went up like a flash . The fire is supposed to have started from a defective trolley wire . It broke out just before the workmen had returned from dinner . Several cars in the shop were being repaired , and in some way the wires came is contact and started the blaze . The few workmen who had come it : to the building were speedily driven out . One of the men telephoned to the nearest volunteer company of the Queens County Fire Department , but there was consider , able delay , as most of the members were at dinner , and had to be drummed up hi sections .
