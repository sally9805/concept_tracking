txt Washington E. Connor , banker , operator , and a figure in Wall Street , has resigned . from the Republican Club . Its latest bit of political philosophy was more than he could stand . While Mr. Connor has not been known as personally active in politics he has been a valued member of the club . His prominence in Wall Street has been duly appreciated . In campaign times his contributions are understood to have been large and freely given . Mr. Connor 's resignation is from the club , not from the Republican Party . He is still a Republican , but he is not an admirer of some recent antics of the organization from which he has resigned . He believes that partisanship should be sunk in regard for the common welfare in times like these and that the good of the country is the first thing to be considered . Tho club 's idea appears to differ from this . It does not care to recognize the fact that the remedying of the financial troubles of the Nation 's is a duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying about partisan advantage . As a financial man Mr. Connor has seen the urgent need of legislation to secure a sound and honest money as a first step toward restoring confidence both in this country and abroad . Mr. Connor withdraws from the organization because of an address prepared by the club 's Committee on National Affairs . This document was headed " The Democratic Panic of 1893 . " Mr. Connor 's chief objection to it is that its purpose was to prevent Republicans from turning to and doing their best to relieve the situation . The address was sent out on July 17 . Its opening paragraph describes it thus : " Your committee , mindful of the traditionary custom or our people fully and freely to discuss all questions of public concern , and recognizing the benefits thus obtained , begs leave to submit to the club some o. , servations upon the present deplorable financial , industrial , and business condition of the country , " Among other things it said ; We concede that silver may have aggravated the trouble , and we favor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we assert that the proximate cause was the election of Grover Cleveland as President with both Houses of Congress ** and that the troublesome times through whim ' we are passing will go down to hletury as the Demo  --  ratio panic of 1rs03 . " This idea was harped on through a long tirade against the Democracy , the statesmen of the club drawing pleasing pictures of national happiness under Republican rule , and arguing that the present financial depression was due to the election of Mr. Cleveland . Gold exports , according to their notion , never caused general appreheueion until the Democracy came into power . " Commercial business and the varied industries of the country " are represented to be the " suffering victims " of Democracy 's false pretences . Their attention was given to the tariff , to the reform of which was devoted a good deal of hysterical talk . There was much said of the beauties of , and the address closed with a uaYve appeal to Congress to run its business to suit the wishes of the Republican Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club last night that Mr. Connor had resigned . There were only a few members of the club in the house when a reporter for THE NEW-Yonx TIMES called to see what they had to say about Mr. Connor 's rebuke to the club . Corresponding Secretary Johnson , when asked about Mr. Connor 's resignation , said : " If Mr. Connor has resigned he would be the best one to tell you about it . " " But about the cause of the resignation . What was there in the letter sent out by the Committee on National Affairs which led up to this resignation ? " The Corresponding Secretary asked the clerk of the club for a copy of the letter . The clerk said that he did not have one on hand . " I have not examined it very closely . " said Mr. Johnson . " It is on my desk in the office , but I have only glanced over it . As I understand it , the letter placed the responsibility for the present financial condition upon the result of the last Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club V " " It was approved at a meeting of the Committee on National Affairs . " " There is no question about Mr. Connor 's resignation is there ? You have received it ? " " It may have been received . The story may be true . There are a whole lot of resignations , but I have not sorted them out yet . " " Are the other resignations due to the same cause as Mr. Connor 's ? " gm " Oh , no . You know every club has a lot of resignations every six months , in July and January . " Another man in the clubhouse said : " Mr. Johnson is mistaken about the letter having been approved only by the Committee on National . Affairs . It was approved by the club at its last meeting . " " Was it approved without opposition ? " " Well , there were some suggestions that it be changed . here and there , that it be put in a little different form , but the opposition did not amount to anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. C. Shayno . " Now , I tellgyou what I think . Every man'should stand by his country and by the Government in this difficulty . Party lines should be buried out of sight in the effort to restore peace to the business world . It is a time for patriotism . I did not know of this letter of the committee before . I have been in Chicago . I do not think that this should be made a party matter . I think you will find that all good Republicans think the same way . " Another member of the club . who was not at the clubhouse last night , said , with considerable indignation : The trouble is that we have altogether too much Committee on National Affairs at the Republican Club . There have been protests against it for some time . Its efforts to decide all the big questions that come before this Government are getting to be ridiculous . Some months ago we had the Union League Club blackballing the son of a distinguished Hebrew Republican , who was always a large contributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the club . Now we have the Republican Club making this financial question a party issue . No wonder there are resignations . " The Chairman of the Committee on National Affairs is Joseph M. Deuel . His name was signed to a memorandum which was sent out to the Republican press asking thorn to give space to the " Democratic Panic of 1603 . " These words were printed . in italics on the memorandum .
