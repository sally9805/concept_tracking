txt Wall Street bears did their best yesterday to repeat their raid of the day before and to preach the doctrines of general calamity , but they found it not altogether easy work . From the point of . - view of the banks , the situation had many hopeful aspects . Not the least important of the favorable signs was the increase in the movement of currency to this city from the interior . While it is hard to estimate the extent of this return flow of money , there are many evidences that in the last few days it has reached considerable size . Some of the big banks have received remittances from their country correspondents of more than $300,000 a day . The amount  --  altogether received here yesterday was probably close to $750,000 . One widely-circulated estimate put the receipts for the first three business days of the week at $3,000 , 000 . Some comment was excited by the fact that at the Sub-Treasury about $200,000 in large bills was turned in for exchange for smaller denominations . Part of this money was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the banks , however , failed to show that any considerable demand from the country had developed or that the tide of money was again turning against this city . The general tendency , in fact , was just the other way . Money on call opened at 8 per cent . It touched 15 per cent , but at the close declined to 3 per cent . Several of the city banks were buyers of commercial paper , the range of rates being about the same as on Tuesday , while other purchases were made by country bankers anxious to employ a share of the cash they gathered together a month or two ago in fear of unusual demands upon them . Another small importation of gold is expected to reach this city to-day on the steamship Spree . It is for the Hanover National Bank for the account of one of its customers . There is about $110,000 in the lot . The Sub-Treasury policy of paying out gold on Government checks showed its effects yesterday , when for the first time in a week the Sub-Treasury was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when business is in a normal condition . On Tuesday the Sub-Treasury was a creditor at the Clearing House for $137 , - 000 ; the day before the amount had been $610.000 . It was a debtor yesterday to the extent of $433,000 . The plan of paying out gold was kept up , however , and in this way the establishment 's stock of coin was lessened by $205 , - 000 . The Clearing House Loan ColitAtee met again and issued . $350,000 in : 1 $ ; 00 , ? 800 were cates . Other certificates for eoo were canceled , leaving the total amount outstanding $22,665,000 . There has been more or less talk of the committee 's taking stops to make the banks put their cheeks on the Sub-Treasury through the Clearing House in the ordinary way instead of making collections directly from the Government offices , a method which , as THE NEW-YORK TIMES has told , came into fashion a week or so ago , when the banks were very desirous of securing as much currency as possible . Nothing was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that there will be no need . of any action on the point by that body , owing to the workings of the goldpayment plan . Had that failed to be effective . the committee might have felt forced to do something to get the business of the banks and the Sub-Treasury back into the old channels . In the stock market the day was very lively . Prices were weak at the opening , and there were declines from the figures at Tuesday 's close , but later ou there came a rally , and in the last hour there was a brisk fight between the bulls and the bears . The close was comparatively firm . There was free.covering by the shorts . The results of the day showed pretty thoroughly the character of the raid on prices , and it was also made clear that the London selling , of which the Street heard so much , was engineered by the bears on this side of the water . There was considerable buying of small lots of stock yesterday by investors who believe that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the largest commission houses in the Street said that this buying , to his personal knowledge , exceeded anything of the kind in a year . Of the stocks which had borne the brunt of the attack the day before , General Electric , made a gain of 34 , and closed at 6234 . Lake Shore picked up 112 points , Chicago and Northwestern 15s , New-York Central 12 , and Sugar 118 . St. Paul lost 118 and Louisville and Nashville 4 . Chicago Gas closed at 63 , up 2 points from Tuesday 's last quotation . Three Consolidated Exchange brokers were caught by the fall in stooks and suspended in the morning . They were Washington Barrow , H. Stober , and G. H. Harrill . In none of the cases are the liabilities heavy .
