txt The second concert of the Philharmonic Sopiety 's series in celebration af its arrival at the close of fifty years of usefulness was given yesterday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House . The dismal weather had a serious effect on the size of the audience , which would certainly have crowded the house had the day been clear and inviting . Those who were present , however , wore full of enthusiasm , and they found material upon which to bestow it . The programme was one of great variety in style and of no inconsiderable interest . It consisted of Bach 's concerto in ti major for string orchestra , TsehalkowskY 's concerto in 0 major for Piano and orchestra , three selections Prom Weber 's " Euryanthe . " ( one of which was omitted because of Mr. Fisoher 's indisposition ) and Liszt 's symphony to Dante 's " Divine , Coinmedia . " The solid and profound musical thought of Bach , so sturdy in Its vigor , animating in melody , and continuously interesting in its treatment , was a substantial prelude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was played In a sound style . Mr. fseidl had distributed his forces with the view of improving the homogeneity of tone , mingling the violins . violas , and ' cellos in an unusual manner . The success of the experiment was questionable . Baeb 's part writing probably gains in clearness for the average hearer when the instrumentalists occupy their conventional places ou the stage . However , there need be no serious fault found with a performance that was so thorminhly in keeping in spirit with the classic traditions of the Philharmonio . The Tschaikowsky concerto has not been heard hero of late , and this fact is a subject for remark . It is not a great concerto , but it is one of the most showy in the literature of the piano . To say it is not great is not to deny it all worth . It possesses some excellent thematic material . The principal subjects or the first and last movements are musical , engaging , and fruitful . The melody of the andante is in Tsehaikowsky 's familiar elegiac rein , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The construction of the concerto is excellent . The Subjects are skillfully transferred from the orchestra to the solo instrument and back , and the pianist is given more than abundant opportunities to display his mastery of the most dazzling forms of technical brilliancy . The first movement is unquestionably too long . and the effect of the cadenza in the middle of it is to make it seem longer . The cadenza itself is good , but the movement would be more effective , as well as more symmetrical , were less of the matter repeated in the last part . The solo part of the concerto was played by Franz Rummel with magnificent power and . with surprising abandon . Mr. Rummel 's impassioned temperament is kept under iron control In so much of the music of his Opertoire that he plainly enjoys an opportunity to loosen the rein . - Yet In his work yesterday there was none of the once familiar tendency to let the temperament run away with the judgment . Mr. Rummers purpose was clear and his performance exhibited most excellent repose in such passages as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swift , and finely colored . His tone has not been better in any performance this season . His octaves and rapid chord successions were brilliant . On the whole , Mr. Rummet 's performance must be set down as one of the notable things in a season which has been rich in great piano playing . The artist was recalled several times with very warm applause , and finally added to the programme an exquisitely-finished performance of Chopin 's 1 ) flat major nocturne . Mine . Antonio Mlelke sang Eglantine 's dra-matic aria from " Euryanthe in a vigorous and somewhat explosive style . Her attacks were by no means faultless , aud , to be vary frank , she seemed to do a good deal of her singing by main strength . Mr. Fischer , being sadly out of voice . did not sing Lysiard 's air , but was heard in the duet of Eglantine and Lysiard with Mine . Mielke . The popular basso managed his voice exceedingly well , and its poor condition was not painfully apparent As for the Liszt symphony , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the whole , a remarkably good one . To be sure , the bass clarinet was under the weather a trifle , and the English horn had a mild touch of the grip also : but the precision of the band as a whole was beyond criticism , and not even Liszt himself could have accused Mr. Seidl of a lack of enthusiasm in the reading of the passages allotted to the brass and instruments of percussion . The tones of the chorus , situated at the rear of the stage , which was set with a scene open above and at the sides , were partly lost in the strange regions above the " borders , " but perhaps that added a touch of mystery to the general effect . Mine . /Welke was not quite at ease in her solo in the " Magnificat " However , Liszt 's music is not of a kind to bring the teat of joy to the eye of sympathy . The final concert of the series will take place tonight The programme will consist of the following numbers : Overture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first act of ? Fidello. " selections front " Die Glitterellimmerung , " and Beethoven 's ninth symphony . Pupils of the New-York College of Music appeared in a concert at the Music Hail last night . assisted by Walter Damrosoh and the Symphony Orchestra . The concert was undertaken by the energetic director of the college , Alexander Lambert , for the purpose of adding to the freeseholarehlp fund of the institution , and . judging from the appearance of the house , the fund must have been considerably increased . The concert was uncommonly interesting as a display of the results of good methods of teaching . The pupils all showed that they had enjoyed the benefits of sensible and competent instruction , and in those cases in which the natural gifts were generous the results were correspondingly enjoyable . The list of performances ( all with orchestral was as follows : First movement of Rubinate 's D minor piano concerto , Miss Jessie D. Shay ; first movement of the Mendelssohn violin concerto , Arthur Temme ; aria from Massenet 's " Eferodiade , " Miss Etta D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerto , Miss Berths Pemberton ; aria from Gounod 's " queen of Sheba , " Miss Augusta Yendik ; second and third movements of a violin concerto of De Beriot , Master Arthur Hartmann ; Liszt 's fantasy on Beethoven 's ? Ruins of Athens . " for piano , Miss Henrietta Seckendorf ; spinning song from " The Flying Dutchman . " Miss Yendik , Miss Amelia Hirschfield , and the young ladies or the vocal sight-reading class . This kind of concert does not can for criticism , but whore promise above the average Is discernible a word or encouragement can do no harm . Mine . Fursch-Madi 's pupil , Miss Yendik , displayed a voice of lovely quality , and a tone production quite satisfactory except in the highest notes , which arc not yet fully developed . In one phrase the young lady forded her lowest tones a little , otherwise her delivery was very smooth and her phrasing excellent The solidity and roundness of her voice , together with the good foundation she has laid in her technique . give valuable promise for Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her powers . In Mme. Fursch-Math , however , she has a wise guide . Little Arthur Hartmann , a mere child yet , is a pupil of Beery Lambert . The boy has acquired already an exquisitely pure and round tone , a pretty good foundation for a violinist . The tone will grow bigger in time , and the keen ear of the child for the incisiveness of a piquant rhythm and the certainty of his touch in stopping ( within reasonable limits ) will surely lead him in the hands of a good teacher to a good position as a player . There can be no question that he has been well taught up to the present time .                     @x txt There has been no recurrence of the earthquake shocks in the Vacu Valley , and the three towns where the greatest damage 000urrod are rapidly recovering from the effects of the disaster .
