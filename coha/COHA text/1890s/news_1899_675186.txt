txt It is generally understood that " Anti- Trust " will be the rallying cry for the Democracy , with " Anti-Imperialism " a close second , and " 16 to 1 ' not entirely discarded , but kept in third place . As one of the leaders of the party expressed it , " ' Anti-trust ' and ' Anti-imperialism ' will be the salt and pepper with which we will flavor ' 16 to 1 . " There have been rumors afloat to the effect that silver is to be entirely discarded and that as far as Missouri is concerned , Bryan is to be shelved in favor of ex-Gov . William J. Stone , who is said to be making earnest efforts to secure the Presidential nomination . Failing in this endeavor , it is said , he will turn his attention to the United States Senate .

The harmony of the gathering is threatened by the quarrel among the Illinois Democrats . It is almost certain that the fight betwen the Harrison and Altgeld factions will develop into a warm controversy before the conference . Altgeld will be here to direct his forces , and Harrison 's friends are coming in . An effort will be made before the conference to oust Altgeld from the Chairmanship of the Sub-Finance Committee . to which he was appointed by Chairman Jones of the National Committee . It is claimed by the Harrison following that Altgeld placed himself outside of the party when he ran independently against Harrison for Mayor of Chicago .
