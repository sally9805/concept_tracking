txt With or without an income tax the Tariff bill will be promptly passed if Congress has the regard it should have for the business interests of the country . The income tax is objectionable , it is a war tax in time of peace , a needless , inequitable , inquisitorial , odious impost . But throughout the country merchants and manufacturers declare that a taxed income is better than no income at all . They are tired of hard times . They want to go to making money again . The silver panic destroyed the Fall trade , tariff delay and uncertainty have killed the Spring trade . Put an end to the uncertainty , pass the Tariff bill in any reasonable form , and the chief element of doubt and apprehension in the business situation , the only conspicuous obstacle to restored prosperity , will be removed . But if the Democratic Senators and members from the South and West are determined to levy the tribute of this sectional tax upon the North and East , they ought at least to have the decency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . It will be bad enough in its best shape . It is full of crudities and unfairness and violations of fiscal propriety . Some incomes will be taxed twice , some more than twice . Surely , its authors never intended to commit highway robbery in the guise of an income tax . The East may , without presumption , ask this small favor . The Eastern Democrats have protected the South from the Force bill and the West from bankruptcy . If they are to be plundered by these gentlemen whose battles they fought , they ask that the plundering be done with such fairness as the nature of the act permits . But with or without the income tax pass the Tariff bill . The income tax is a transitory Populist fancy . It will not continue in force three years . The reform of the tariff is a work of enduring necessity , of permanent benefit to the country . The accomplishment of that work would , more than anything else that legislation can do , promote the return of prosperous times .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
