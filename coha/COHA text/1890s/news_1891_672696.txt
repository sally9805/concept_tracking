txt A tall man . wearing a high hat , a suit of blank broadcloth , and patent leather boots , whose odd appearance attracted attention from everybody , sat in one of the chairs on the floor of the Produce Exehasige yesterday when business opened . His face was smooth-shaven andflorid . A prominent nose and firm-set lips , a forehead of medium height , long eyebrows and lashes over keen blue eyes , a chin not very prominent , but far from retreating , and a ottantityof iron-gray hair , closely out , were his noticeable features . His frock coat was buttoned squarely up . A dark blue  --  blaek shield with polka dots on it covered his shirt bosom . When he stood up the top of his head was fully six feet from the floor . His hat was not of modern shape . The rim was wide and the crown rather boll-shaped , like thoee which the pioture papers make for the grandfather of President Harrison . The man 's arms and legs were long and lank and his hands big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of the Exchange came in they looked at him , wondering who he was and how he came upon the floor . He sat quietly looking at the finishing of the room with evident admiration , and occasionally looked at the clock . He crossed one log over the other and rubbed his chin with the bony fingers of his right hand . Apparently he did not know any one who was there . He spoke to no one and no one spoke to him for some time . He had entered the etoom with Mr. J. C. Wiswall , who had gone to attend to some business after showing him to a seat . At length Mr. Wiswall returned with Frank Quinby , also a member of the Exchange . " Mr. Quinby , " said Mr. Wiewall , leading that gentleman before the tall man with the oldfashioned bat . " let me introduce YOU to Mr. B. P. Hutchinson of Chicago . You know ? Old Hutch ' of the Board of Trade , of course . " The stranger really was " Old Hutch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat ; who has squeezed " the shorts " until , to use his own words , he has " made their hair curl , " and whose business operations in Chicago recently ended in financial collapse . As the members came in many were intro ( Meet ' to Old Hutch " I 'm glad to see ye , " he said , rising and shaking hands with each . " How 's wheat to-day 1 " " Old Hutch " arrived in New-York Sunday from Boston and went to the Astor House . He remained in his room most of the day , and at 6:30 o'clock yesterday morning , after a light breakfast . paid his bill , and carrying his gripsack and overeoat , went to the Produce Exehange . He reached that building before 7 o'clock . No one was there but the janitors , and they told hint to go away and come back later in the day if he wanted to see any one . He said be simply wanted to look over the building . They told him he might leave his gripsack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would not take anythieg or disturb the papers on file in the reading room . He tipped his bat book on his head and walked about the corridors for half an hour , until the Wilco boy for G. K. Clark &; Co. arrived . Mr. Hutchinson then took hi gripsack to the office of that firm , and the office boy told him he might come in and read the papers ' until the members of the firm arrived . G. K. Clark &; Co. were formerly bne of " Ohl Hutch 's " connections in this city and he had known them for years . He waited in the office until J. C. Wiswall or that firm came , and with him he chatted for an hour . He said he wanted to go on the floor of the Exchange , and Mr. Wiswall got him a ticket . Then " Old Hutch " went out upon the street . Apparently the haunts of the business men charmed him .

But the charm which hangs about " the wheat pit , " whether it be in Chicago , where be Was the giant among operators , or elsewhere , prevented tho old operator from long visits at other places , and at the oisenuig of the Produce Exchange hei was there to watch the play of the bulls and bears . When it became lenown who he was , there was a bit of excitement Some mon who may nave felt the squeeze when " Old Hutch " pet on the screws years back Were there , and looked at the broken speculator as members of a menagerie might look upon its boss lion when his teeth and claws had been pulled out The brokers crowded about him , and the remark Was constantly making : " It 's Old Hutoh . " " Old Hutch " at near the wheat pit much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one was ranting to him he had an abstracted look , watching the noisy crowd in their struggles M the pit . Oceasiotally he arose and walked out into the corridor , returning in a few minutes and reauming his seat . Sometimes an acquaintance came within speaking distance and gave him the quotations on wheat or oats . At such times he started up , made some remark , and then sat still again . " I like to see them boys agein ' it , " he said to a TIMES reporter who sat beside him for a time during the afternoon . " I like to see ' em hustle . New-York is a great place . Your building here is finished better than ours is in Chicago , but eon do n't make so much noise over wheat . We rattle thinks up on the board livelier than you do here . You beat us on flour , but when it Comes to - wheat we lay over all the country . " " Do you expect to trade again1 " " Old Hutch " was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I 'm a tradin ' now . I trade every day I live . I telegraphed some sales of corn and oats to Chicago this morning . I ai n't touching wheat to-day , and I ai n't doing any monkeying in the NowYork pit , but you can put it down that Hutchinson trades some every day . " " Do you expect to conduct large operations again , as you used to I " ? I do n't know . I 'm only resting now  --  taking a swing around and seeing the old boys . It 's eight years since I was in ew-York , and the town is getting away from me . This Stook Exchange was n't here the last time I was here . And a lot of the old fellows have died off and a crowd of boys come up . Why . Lord , boy , I used to do business in this town before you was born . when Jesse Hoyt and David Dows was the big guns . I tell yon , David Dews was tee greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , or in this country , I believe . In them days the trading used to be done down in South Street , I believe , and it was n't such a fine place as this , either . " While Mr. Hutchinson was speaking , a broker came up and said to him : e Wheat is down a quarter . ' " Yes . Is bad weather for it , " " Hutch " replied . " It 's not , and that makes it bad for all kinds of Spring vegetables . " " As I was 0-going to say " continued the veteran , " New-York is a big town . You make more noise on the street down town than we do . After 9 o'clock had work for me to get around . I just want to look things over . Hutch ai n't a MAW In New-York. but I want to see the lay of the land . Just to get a good look at the place . I got up at 5 o'clock this morning . I poked down to this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I looked the ground all over before the gang got hero . " " Will you step across the street with me 1 " asked a broker of Mr. Hutohinson at 1:30 o'clock . " Yes , and have some of the wine that God made for all men  --  pure water , " said " Old Hutch . " " I wish I could get some hard eider , good old-fashioned hard older such as I used to get down in New-England when I was a boy . They do n't make it now . These fancy drinks they mix is enough to turn a fellow 's insides out of him . Maybe the boys like them , but they wo n't do for the old-timers like me . " Mr. Hutohinson accompanied the broker . He , did not drink hard eider nor pure water . He called for a drink that is known in the drug store where he buys it regularly in Chicago as " Old Hutch 's cocktail . " " Put in some seltzer and some apollinaris. a little sugar , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar followed instructions . That was all there was in it , and the old gentleman drank it and smacked his lips . Ten minutes later he was back on the floor or the Exchange , back again by the wheat pit " Chicago is up to 51e , ' said a broker , just as " Old Hutch " was sitting down . He straightened up in a hurry and said : " That 's better ; that 's better . " Then he got down and looked at the clock . He watched the olook and the operators in the pit alternately until it was within a minute of closing time . " Them fellows have got to shut off iu just about sixty seconds . " he mused . " Some of them have probably been feeling a little better and some of them a little worse for the last ten minutes than they did this morning . " The story was passed around the Exchange that " Old Hutch " was trading , and there was curiosity to know in what and in Which way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in his own name , and he said he was not taking any part in New-York operations . When business closed , Mr. Hutchinson Went with a small party of friends to the street lust outside the Bxotuange . In half an hour he was bark in the Exchange building . He ' walked up and down the oorridors on the ground floor . and then Went to the reading room . Ile remained there about twenty minutes , and then wont to the office of G. K. Clark &; Co. , on the secon d floor of the Exchange . He was there Imre about 5 o'clock . He looked at the *mon furnishings , went out and walked up and down the corridors , and apparently admired the structure , If he had been a boy and the Stock Exchange had been a new tay he could not have looked it over and been apparently any happier than he was yesterday .
