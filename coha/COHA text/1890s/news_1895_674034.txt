txt Ex-Mayor GRACE accepts as sound the opinion long held and often expressed by THE TIMES that all the Democrats in this city ought to be members of the Democratic Party of the City of New-York , organized as such and to be known by no other name . It is his belief that if the name of Tammany Hall were dropped from the call for the primaries to be held this month " most Democrats who would vote at a primary would respond . " But Mr. GRACE thinks the State Democracy should have one Inspector out of three . A proposition to divide the Inspectorships between two warring factions does not help matters much . Nor are we able to perceive the rainbow of promise in Mr. CROKER 'S suggestion that the Tammany primaries be " open all day . " What assurance does mere all-day opening give of the future management and policies of the party ? If a Democrat of brains and character wished to make a suggestion for the good of the party , would lie still have to call on Mr. JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over the seas about nominating time to tell us that he was entirely out of politics ? We suppose Mr. CROKER understands perfectly the purpose and effect of Democratic reorganization in this city . He knows that a vast majority of the Democrats want to get away from the things of the past . That is what they mean when they talk about re-enrollment . But when they take up the subject of reformed primaries , Mr. CROKER devises the reform . " They reckon ill who leave me out . When me they fly , I am the wings . " This is a very good way to keep CO per cent . of the Democrats outside the regular organization . It is a good way to keep the control in the hands of a small clique . It is also b , first-rate way to insure great Republican victories . If the primaries are to be anything different from the ordinary Tammany primaries , they ought to be held under the management and guarantee of a large representative committee of wellknown Democrats , and with Inspectors chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the desired result .
