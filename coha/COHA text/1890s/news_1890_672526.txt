txt President Potter of Hobart College , General Secretary of the Churoh University Board of Regents , appeared before the Schuylkill and Lehigh Convocation yesterday at Reading , and explained the new educational movement in the Protestant Episcopal Church , a movement which President Potter thinks will oharaeterize the second century of the Church 's history , and will make the record of the American Church comparable with that of the Mother Church of England in Church schools and colleges . It was peculiarly appropriate for President Potter to make this statement before a Convocation which his father , Alonzo Potter , had founded , and for whose educational institutions he had done so much . It was President Potter who in his early ministry announced to the Bishop of Pennsylvania the intention of Judge Asa Packer to found and endow Lehigh University , now one of the strongest Church institutions , which will be an important link in the proposed scheme . President Potter is confident of the success of the educational trust . To-day persons connected with the Episcopal Church are on record as having given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem not only indifferent but inimical to the Church and religion . It is hoped that these enormous sums will be diverted into Church ohannels In the future , and that a fund will be established from which Western Bishops and Church educational institutions in all parts of the land may receive aid . Scholarships and fellowships will be established and foundations for lectureships be laid in the colleges already established . All this will be done in order that , at the end of the second century the record of the Episcopal Church may be more creditable , more in accord with its weath and intelligence . For this end President Potter will travel through the country , appearing before educators and dioceses and laboring with wealthy individuals .
