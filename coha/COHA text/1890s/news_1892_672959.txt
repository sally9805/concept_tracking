txt There was a rear-end collision on the Rapid Transit Railway on Staten Island yesterday , the engine of a Tottenville train , heavily loaded , crashing into the last oar of a South Beaoh special , also heavily loaded . Wonderful to relate , nobody was seriously hurt and the damage to property was extremely small , the Circumstances considered . Staten Island with its South Beach and innumerable pleasure parks , where the sale of beer is practically unrestricted , is a popular Sunday resort and playground for New-York 's working people and their families . Yesterday fully 75,000 people from this city visited the island . It was not an unusual crowd in point of numbers for a Staten Island Summer Sunday , but the crowd came in the afternoon all together , and the railroad people were not prepared to handle so many so early in the season . rho Staten Island ferryboats from South Ferry arrived at St. George each paoked with from 3,000 to 4.000 people from noon until 6 o'clock . Special trains were quickly made up and were dispatched as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight cars , with seats , passageways , and platforms literally packed with men , women , and children , was started from St. George for South Beach , in charge of Conductor Turner . Two minutes later a Tottenville train of live cars , equally crowded , was started over the same tracks , in charge of Conductor Connor and Engineer Kennedy . The South Beach train stopped at Tompkinsville and had just come to a standstill at the Stapleton station when the Tottenville train , which made no stops , dashed around a curve . Engineer Kennedy discovered the local too late to stop his train and the locomotive dashed into the rear oar of the local with terrine force . The heavy South Beach train was driven ahead fully fifteen feet by the force of the collision . The glass in more than half the windows in all the oars was broken ; the rear platform , which . fortunately , is arways kept unoccupied , was crushed into kindling wood and the rear of the oar smashed in . The ear was raised up by the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forward wheels . The locomotive or the Tottenville train was badly wrecked , but broken windows was the only damage to tho oars . The scene in the oars can hardly be described . Passengers were thrown down by the shook and cut by the broken glass . Men as well as women were panic-stricken , and shouted , screamed , and fainted . Men and boys began to leave the oars by the platforms and windows on both sides of the train . Suddenly a train was heard approaching on the other track . It , like the other two , was crowded with people . A sharp curve a block south of the station would prevent the engineer from seeing the trouble ahead . With great presence of mind a brakeman on the South Beach train rushed down the track waving a bandana handkerchief and succeeded in preventing another accident . Strange to say , no one was seriously injured by the collision . The platform gates had not been opened when the collision occurred , and this prevented a rush from the cars , w hick would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides that , the people were packed in so closely that the majority were compelled to remain quiet until the first panic had passed . Mrs. Lena Saron. who was with her daughter , aged four years . and her husband , David Saron , of 45 Pearl Street , this city , had her face badly out and was Injured about the body . The child had one hand crushed . Henry Cripps of Tompkinsville , S. I. , had one of his logic out . Very many others were slightly out by broken glass , but none required surgical attendance . Two men were pinned in the wreck of the rear car , but were not injured . The accident blocked the south-bound track for about fifty minutes , and during that time several boats discharged crowds of people at St. George and the platforms were packed with a perspiring crowd of swearing men , complaining women , and crying children . Once on the platform it was impossible to retreat , and there the unfortunate pleasure seekers were compelled to stay . When the crowd finally reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful southerly breeze and forgot their sorrows and discomforts . Elm Park and Erastina , on the north shore of the island , is the Mecca for baseball and football players and hurlers . Brown's. near Elm . Park , and Boyle 's Park , at Erastina , are also the resorts of many of these players . A week ago there was a small-sized riot between rival football teams at Boyle'a Park . and yesterday Sergt. Drummond and a squad of policemen were on duty in that part of the island , instructed to atop all games . Five ball games and one hurling match were stopped . Tho players protested . but obeyed the orders , and there were no arrests . A party of Elebreivs from this city wont to Haussen 's Park at Annandale to hold a picnics . The pleasure was in full swing and the platform was tilled with dancers , when tiergt . Hannon appeared with his policemen from Tottenville and arrested the musicians . The six men were lined $2.50 each by Justice , and the lines were paid .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
