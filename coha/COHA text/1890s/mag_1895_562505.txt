txt A* Englishman visiting the United States at this time , finds his American friends peering with more than usual anxiety into the mist which shrouds the immediate future . He , of course , does not see so much as a native sees ; but he looks from a different point of view , and he has the advantage of comparison with another country to aid him in taking the measure of the American situation . Foreigners visiting the United States , even those who come for the special purpose of observation , commonly confine their inspection to the great cities , which are the chief seats of the political evil and the storm centres of danger . One who has seen the country also , will have ever present to his mind the reserve of good sense and patriotism of which the rural districts are the seat . To trust that reserve in due measure and without assuming that it is either unlimited or sure to come up in time , is rational . To trust the luck of the Republic , is not rational . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapids were drawing irresistibly towards the gulf of civil war ? There is no denying the ominous character of the last session of Congress , or the sinister significance of the general sense of relief evidently felt at the departure of the assembly which has the destinies of the nation in its trust . The session threw a strong light on the weak points of the American , or Presidential and Congressional system , in contrast with the Parliamentary system of Great Britain . With a responsible Ministry , such as initiates and controls legislation in the British Parliament , Congress could not have become a chaos . The Ministry would have appealed to the allegiance of its supporters , and if , with their votes , it could JaQt control legislation , it would have given way to a government // which could . We have often occasion to remark that the framers of the American Constitution did not understand the British system of Parliamentary government . The British did not understand it themselves . They were mystified by the forms of a monarchy , and fancied that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet got clear of the illusion ; they recklessly extend the franchise in the belief that they have a stable government in the crRwn . The largeness of the Democratic majority in Congress also contributed to its unruliness . The Republican majority in the next Congress will be liable to the same danger from the same cause . If party government is to work well , the two teams will have to be kept , as in a foot-ball match , pretty equal , or with only a working majority on one side . On another weak point in the American system a strong light has been thrown by the continuance in session of a House of Representatives after the defeat of its party at the polls . The framers of the Constitution , when they adopted this dovetailing arrangement did not contemplate party , or provide for its action on the legislature . Washington took it for a transient disease , which might be cured by putting Hamilton and Jefferson together into the cabinet . The disadvantages of the arrangement seem now to be acknowledged by all ,  --  yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its sacred stability , is an inestimable bulwark , especially in stormy times , but its amendment , even when plainly reqnired , is certainly difficult in the extreme . No pressure seems sufficient for the purpose except that which was generated by the Civil War . Even a change of the inauguration day , such as would save the President from riding through snow and sleet , appears to be regarded as practically impossible , because it would involve a constitutional amendment . Liability to deadlock from the division of the legislative power between two bodies which may at the time be in the hands of opposite parties , is not peculiar to the American polity . It is the general infirmity of the bicameral system when combined with that of party , and must be taken with the advantages of the system in which it inheres . It must be owned that the American system has , of late , been severely tried . In the midst of a great financial crisis Congress // *l49 was called upon to revolutionize the fiscal and commercial policy of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fulfilment of election pledges . When a surgeon who has set out to perform a dangerous operation , finds the patient in a high fever , though he may have brought his instrumer*ts with him , does he not stay his hand ? An attack on the whoie fiscal system was sure to combine all the protected interests in a desperate defense , and to bring on a conflict by which the financial crisis could hardly fail to be aggravated and prolonged . The worst part of the matter is the catastrophe of the Senate , to which Englishmen , who feel the necessity of a second chamber as a security for rational conservatism , have of late been pointing as an example . But the fault lies largely in a peculiarity of the American Senate , which English reformers would not reproduce . I mean that provision , a relic of the original jealousy and necessity for a compromise among the independent colonies for the sake of union , which gives Colorado , Nevada , Nebraska , Montana and Wyoming , a representation in the Senate equal to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time we have had in the dire influence of the Silver Mine , especially in the Senate , an awful warning of the force which under the system of party government , and when parties are evenly balanced , special interests , disregarding every object but their own , may exert . This evil is growing everywhere , and calls for the earnest consideration of statesmen and of writers on political science . Another element of critical change which begins to show itself is the disintegration of party . This is sure to ensue when great lines of division , such as that between slavery and free labor no longer exist and sectional or personal tendencies come into free play . In France , Germany , Spain , Italy , and even in England , d isintegration and sectionalism have already set in . In France the formation of a stable government has become almost hopeless . The huge see-saw of the last two Congressional elections indicates the existence on a large scale of an unattached vote . if the sugar trust did half what it is said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the capitol would be a incasnre at once salutary and just . When the public conscience succumbs to corruption all is lost . But one who has been long in the United States will be cautious in giving ear to general reports // of corruption . That it prevails in some of the State legislatures and in the governments of great cities is too evident . But critics , usually severe , say that there are very few members of Congress who would take a bribe . The civil service of the nation is admitted , notwithstanding the dangerous smallness of the salaries , to be pure . Jurymen , in the rougher States , we are told , are sometimes bought , but of the integrity of the judges one hears no complaint . The day of Barnard and Cardozo is long past . On the honor of West Point there is as yet no stain . Presidents seem to have given effect to the Civil Service Act about as far as party necessities would permit . In the intervals between great issues , party organizations can be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid . The root and branch advocates of civil service reform are the Mugwumps , who are outside party , and on whom its necessities do not press . It must be owned , however , that the tendency of the popular government to corruption is a mournful fact . In England , hitherto , Parliament has been a house of gentlemen , fortified against corruption by their wealth . The flagrant corruption of the last century had special causes and ended with the victory of Pitt over the Coalition ; though the patronage , which was rich and splendid , including bishoprics , governorships , judicial appointments and peerages , dispensed as a party fund , continued to be a main support of government . That United States Senatorships are bought is freely alleged . Fraud in elections appears to be too common , and the practice of deciding contested elections by a party vote in Congress , discarded by England more than a century ago , shelters and fosters this great crime . The Southerners were statesmen after their kind . They held their seats in Congress , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure tenure and were able , like the British aristocracy , to train themselves and devote their lives to public affairs . They and their party managed , after their fashion , to govern the country . Who , or what is to govern it now , is the question which one hears more often asked than answered . There is a general cry for leadership , but where are the leaders to be found or how are they to be made ? In England , under the guise of popular election , we have hitherto had the rule of a wealthy and leisured class . We are now going to try what sort of rule universal suffrage and payment // of members will give the nation , and not the nation alone , but the Empire . On the other hand , there has surely been an improvement in the character of the political press , and in its influence on public life . What is behind the press , it is true , is a momentous question , one of the most momentous questions of the day . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in knowledge , literary ability and instructiveness , at all events , the improvement can hardly be denied , and a journal , whether its own morality be sound or not , must always appeal to moral principles and thus confirm public allegiance to them . The multiplication of great journals precludes a monopoly of opinion , though , on the other hand , desperate expedients may be prompted by the increased struggle for circulation . The beneficial action of the universities on politics by disseminating political knowledge and , still more , perhaps , by diffusing a scientific spirit in opposition to that of faction and passion , is another item on the right side of the account . Only let the universities take care that they do not overpeople themselves . There is a rush into them , owing to the ambitious taste for what are supposed to be the higher callings , such as may some day give birth to an academically educated body of unemployed which will be not only unhappy but dangerous to the State . The Common Schools are the reputed sheet-anchor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of reports drawn up by Dr , J. M. Rice after a tour of inspection , and recently published , throws some doubt on the quality of the instruction . The statistics of truancy , also , would lead us to doubt whether the dangerous classes , whose education and civilization are the principal warrant for the assumption of a parental duty by the State , and for the school tax , are really in school . But the most anxious eyes , after all , must be turned to the moral basis of the system . Character is the great object in the training of the citizen as well as in that of the man , and for this the common school system has no visible instrument or motive power beyond the discipline of the school-house which , as frequent suits against the schoolmasters for punishing pupils show , it is sometimes difficult for the teacher unclothed with parental authority to enforce . The one doctrine of a moral or a social kind instilled by the system is the duty of rising in life . We can not // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all be made to feel that it is a mistake to be contented with the station in which we are born . The original New England school was religious and , as the group of families was small and closely united , it was probably not unparental . The extensive employment of women as teachers also is said , not without probability , to be unfavorable to the formation of manly character in the boys . These are the roots of the national tree , and they must ; not be left out of sight in taking account of the political situation . Complaints are heard of the failure of national spirit , and of the prevalence of local over national interests and aspirations . " We are no longer a nation , we are a set of cabbage grounds and potato plots , " was the wail of a patriot , incensed either by the predominance of some local interest in the tariff question , or by the failure of the American Government , under local pressure , to take the part of its own railways against their Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit at the time of the Civil War , must certainly be struck by its comparative languor now . The Canadian question , and the question of Newfoundland , which carries with it the mouth of the St. Lawrence , have come to a head , and been left to settle themselves with as little attention on the part of the American Government and people as though their scene had been the planet Mars . Hawaii has forced itself upon notice , and in that case there has been also the stimulating suspicion of British designs . But the tide of patriotism has its ebbs as well as its flows , and the party of national aspiration is at present out of power . The revival of interest in national objects abroad , when the hour for it arrives , will be salutary as a diversion from the narrowness and bitterness of the war of factions at home . Municipal corruption is flagrant and apparently desperate enough . But its seat is in great cities . Of the rural municipalities little complaint is heard . The village fund is small ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , and such as there is no difficulty in finding respectable citizens to undertake ; the people know each other and can combine for a good choice . In a great city these conditions are reversed . The fund is very large , and the temptation to stealing great , while there is nobody to keep close watch ; the business is very heavy , and leading men will not leave their own avocations to undertake // it , nor will they willingly throw themselves into the muddy vortex of popular elections ; the citizens know nothing of each other and are totally unable to combine for a good choice , so that the elections inevitably fall into the hands of ringsters , who find in municipal politics a regular and lucrative trade . Moreover , the incidence of city taxation is divorced from the control . The few pay the taxes , while the expenditure is at the will of the many , who get much of their small contributions as taxpayers back in the school fee ; an arrangement which would soon be fatal to any joint stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have failed , and the failure arises apparently from causes inherent in the system , and of which the operation is only suspended for a moment by a spasmodic effort of reform , or the fleeting ascendency of some heaven-sent Mayor . Washington , governed as the federal capital by three Commissioners appointed by the President of the United States , seems to be the only great city of which the administration is permanently and securely good . Yet there seems little chance of persuading the masses to relinquish their power . In this direction the outlook is not hopeful . The administration of English cities has been cited in favor of government by an elective council . Municipal elections in England have hitherto been treated as party questions ; the parties have made the nominations , and have striven to bring out their strongest men . The governing class in England has not yet entirely ceased to govern , nor have the other classes yet entirely ceased to obey . In England municipal office is sought for its dignity , which ranks next below that of national office , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have watched the career of the new council of London , and noted the character of some of the " progressist " elections , will pause before citing British example as conclusive in favor of Aldermanic government . Of the financial crisis let financiers speak . Partly it is the local incidence of a universal depression , caused , as some say , by overproduction , though it is difficult to see how mankind can be starved by superfluity of bread . But partly , as all admit , it is the reckoning day of mismanagement , extravagance and fraud . With the eager cupidity excited by a vast and rapid development of natural resources , has been combined the influence of an education of which the grand precept is to grow rich . Profuse expenditure , from Congress with its Pension Arrears Bill , downwards // to the private citizen , must also have contributed to the crash . The day of boundless plenty and thoughtless profusion is past , that of frugality has come . I have seen after a large water party all the broken bread , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Perhaps of the distress among the farmers while most is due to the fall in the price of wheat , some may also be due to the rise in the scale of living . Meantime the outward signs of wealth and prosperity to a visitor 's eye have not fallen off . Luxury and all its appliances iucrease ; the hotel menu is as prodigal as ever ; the watering-places and theatres are full . Railway stock may fall , but the service of the railways maintains its excellence . At the foundation of the State , as at present constituted , lies the family . The politician , therefore , as well as the domestic moralist , must read with dismay statistics of divorce which show that in one State there is divorce to every eleven marriages . Of all the thunder clouds none is darker or more charged with ruin than this . The responsibility , so far as it is legislative , rests not only on those legislatures which have perilously relaxed the divorce law , but upon jurists who , carried away by the generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , have broken up the legal and economical unity of the family . To preserve its integrity the family needs a headship . The necessity may be unwelcome , and to the nihilist or anarchist most odious , but it seems to be the flat of nature . Of the race problem in the South there is as yet no solution , nor apparently can there be any , since intermarriage , the indispensable guarantee for equality , social or political , is out of the question . Without a solution , however , there may be a compromise or modu8 vivendi , if the inferior race will accept personal and industrial right without political power , and if the white will renounce lynching and give the black man the full protection of the law . The lynching has been most horrible , most heartrending , most dishonorable to American civilization . On the other hand , the solid South is manifestly beginning to break up , and the political danger arising from Southern union and isolation is in a fair way to disappear . The introduction of manufactures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its train , and the fiscal policy of the Republican party gains ground in the realm of Calhoun. // These are subjects of anxiety more or less peculiar to the United States . So is the danger from foreign immigration , the reality of which every labor conspiracy and every riot shows , the violence on these occasions being mainly foreign . The policy of restriction naturally prevails , and presents a curious contrast to the rapturous welcome which only a quarter of a century ago America was extending , as the asylum of nations , to the suffering and oppressed of all lands . Yet , while reasonable restrictions are imposed , it must be borne in mind that American civilization rests on manual labor , and that the native American will not carry the hod , shovel the earth for the railroad , or work in the mine . Canada will bring a strong reinforcement to the original element if she ever comes into the Union . But steam and electricity have made the world one . America shares , with other industrial countries , the disturbances and dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capital . Yet she is on the whole less threatened than England . Her mechanics are , as a rule , better instructed than the English mechanics , and therefore less open to delusion . They have probably spent more of their wages in the improvement of their condition , especially in the matter of house-owning , and less in meat , drink and tobacco . Nor are they collected in inflammable masses to the same extent as the mechanics in the North of England . The social line between employer and employed being not so sharp in the democratic as in the aristocratic country , there is less of social bitterness in their antagonism . The American area , also , is too vast for all-embracing organizations , as the history of the Knights of Labor shows . Mr. Burns , a firstrate authority on the subject , after a visit to America , denounces it in the robust language of " Labor** as a far worse field for the industrial agitator than his own country . To this view I adhere even after the Chicago riot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , as landlords , and their tenants , than between employer and employed . The disturbance loomed so large because , taking place at a great railway centre , it caused widespread inconvenience and loss . It was followed , after the first moment of bewilderment , by a national reaction which sustained the President in his vigorous course of repressicin . Its moral seems to be the need of a regular army strong enough to assure the ascendency of law over disorder , // everywhere and at any moment , in a country which is always receiving elements of turbulence and lawlessness from half-civilized provinces in Europe . A militia is a bad instrument of repression . It is a gun , which either goes off too soon or will not go off at all . Even for the purpose of external defense the United States can hardly afford to be unarmed . China and Japan may , in time , threaten the Pacific coast , and the people of the South American republics , however they may fail politically , keep up their military habits and force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions in Europe , has not failed to extend itself to the United States . But American socialism is mainly imported , though the faith has found a native prophet in Mr. Henry George , at the meetings of whose disciples , not only agrarian but general confiscation , and war against wealth of all kinds , fill the air . Property , or the hope of property , is as yet more widely diffused here than in old countries . The freehold farmer of the United States is not like the farm laborer in England craving for three acres and a cow , nor is he likely to listen with favor to schemes of agrarian plunder . Still , there is in America a party , and probably a growing party , of socialistic confiscation . The income tax is hailed by that party as the earnest of a more extensive application of political force to the spoliation of the few by the many , which is now the demagogue 's grand lure . It is this use of political power for the purpose of confiscation-not more moral surely than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot-that is the thing really to be feared . Utopian speculations and visions , the offspring of impatient broodings over the defects of the social system and the cruel inequalities of the human lot , may be dismissed with a sympathetic smile . No serious plan for the reorganization of society on socialistic principles has yet been propounded . Until this is done , the reveries of fancy can alarm , if at all , only as the rainbow over the waterfall which marks the plunge of the torrent beneath . Akin to the last mentioned question is that of the Unemployed , of men who are seeking for work and can not find it . The number of these , it is to be feared , is increasing , apart from the accidents of the seasons , even on this continent , and in spite of all restrictions on immigration . The cause usually assigned // *557 is the discharge of hands , owing to the increased use of machinery on the farm as well as in the factory , to which , perhaps , may be added the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is nseless to deny that there is truth , though there may also be overstatement or disregard of necessary qualifications , in the Malthusian theory . Malthus persists in returning from " the moon , " to which by philanthropists he has been complacently " banished . " There is , after all , a tendency in man , in the absence of prudential restriction on marriage , or a check of some kind , such as tribal wars , on the growth of population , to multiply beyond the means of subsistence . In Ilindoostan the peace of the British Empire has put an end to the wars which before decimated the people , and no other check having been imposed , the result is overgrowth of population , with a lowering of the condition of the ryot . Yet social demagogues are telling the people that they may fearlessly multiply , and even that the more there are of them on a given area the better they will be fed ; as though the productive powers of nature were unlimited , and the fruits of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To me , it has throughout seemed that , beneath all the social and political ferment , with which the age is rife , lies the disturbance , by the progress of religions scepticism , of the beliefs by which the social system and social morality have hitherto been upheld . Men are ceasing to believe that the existing state of things , with all its inequalities , is the ordinance of God , rebellion against which would be at once impious and fruitless , or to look forward to compensation in a future world for those whose lot is hard in this . They are beginning to say that the existing state of things and the uneven distribution of wealth , instead of being the ordinance of God , are the artifice of the rich , and that they mean no longer to be put off to a future life . but to grasp their share of good things in the present . For that purpose the masses are learning to use the political power which has newly come into their hands . Social morality itself , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis when the religious sanction has been withdrawn . America partakes of this disintegration of fundamental belief with Europe , but not in the same degree . She is less heterodox , for the very reason that she has been less orthodox , and because , haying no State Church , she has // nothing to chafe dissent and scepticism to violence* Nor has religion in her case been exposed to popular suspicion by reason of its connection with tithes . Orthodox Christianity here slides by a tranquil process into Christian theism . Reverence , though diminished , is not lost , nor would American opinion tolerate such publications as the comic Life of Christ , which I found in an anti-clerical bookstore at Paris . Still , Colonel Ingersoll lectures to large and sympathetic audiences . Religious doubt unquestionably gains ground . In church after church , clerical heresy is brought to the bar . There will be a serious danger to soCiety if a body so numerous and powerful as the clergy should , through the advance of scepticism , find their ministrations discarded and their means of subsistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were unmarried , as the Catholic clergy are , to find a new basis in preaching the social revolution . We have had premonitions of something of that kind . In the United States , as elsewhere , these are critical times for society . To say that they are dangerous times would , perhaps , be to betray a lack of faith in the goal towards which humanity is marching . They are , at all events , not times for the invidious ostentation of wealth , for Diamond Queens , for shoddy travesties of royal marriages , or for building gaudy palaces at extravagant cost . They are not times for squandering the riches , produced by American industry , in the pleasure cities of Europe . Wealth must henceforth learn to find its justification and guaranty not in any superhuman authority , but in its demonstrable usefulness to mankind . Nor is this necessity an evil to the possessors . What can be baser or more miserable than to live a mere burden on the community , in luxury , fed by the sweat of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such is their feeling . She has others who do not . In America , as in England , and in the other colonies of England-all of which seem to be attacked at once by a sort of disease which might be scientifically labelled gymemania-the restlessness of the age has extended to the domain of sex . Some women are longing to break through the established limitations of womanhood , while they show an inclination to disparage what have hitherto been considered at once the natural duties and olories of woman . They are now seeking to grasp political power , which in their hands would be divorced from responsibility , since // the burden and duty of upholding and safeguarding the State must ever remain where Natnre has put them-in the man . As yet , only two far Western states have adopted woman suffrage in its full political form . It has suffered some defeats in other quarters , and was rejected by the Constitutional Convention of New York . On that occasion the opposition to it included a large and distinguished body of women , who thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to remove the landmarks of nature . But this is an age of feeble and precipitate abdication , when the holders of authority , instead of considering how it may be better used , surrender it upon the first challenge . There is no saying what the bosses of party may do as soon as they see , or fancy that they see , the shadow of a coming female vote , though the consequence might be the swamping of their organizations . The press also may fear , by opposing the demand of the suffragists , to risk the loss of female patronage . When the full tide of female emotion shall be added to the political vortex , when women shall have become political , when the female demagogue with her platform shall be fully developed , the final trial of popular government will be near . No guides can be less safe than the democracies of Australasia , which are made adventurous not only by the heyday of youth , but by the fancied securities of imperial tutelage , while , living in an ocean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the emasculation of their councils , and the weakening of their capacity for self-defence . That they are altogether in a highly experimental stage of existence is shown by the financial crashes and industrial convulsions which , notwithstanding their vaunted system of State socialism , they have recently undergone . The next issue , my friends say , is Silver , at which some of them quake ; not without reason , if the change involves a disturbance of the standard . Just after the war I was one of a party at dinner in England when several men of mark were present , and I was the only man at the table who maintained that the American people would pay their debt in specie . Waiving the question of their morality , I relied on their regard for their credit . The Silver party seems to be made up of different sections not nnited in their object . There are the scientific bimetallists , sincerely convinced that it is possible for governments to fix the ratio of value between two commodities , and that the change would be // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines , whose object needs not to be defined . But there is also Greenbackism , or something like it , coming to life again under another name . These sections will find it difficult to agree in a platform . The movement probably derives encouragement from the vacillation of the British government . That vacillation is purely political . There appears to be an embryo party in England , the offspring of distress among the farmers , corresponding in some measure to that of the Grangers here , which is disposed to seek relief in Bimetallism as well as in Protection ; and this party has votes . On the Conservative side Mr. Balfour dallies with Bimetallism , he also having , it may safely be said , a political object . The members of the Anglo-Indian service whose interest has played an important part in the question upon the British field are not Bimetallists . They only want a rectification of their own salaries which , being paid in silver , have been cruelly reduced by depreciation . The number of scientific bimetallists in England is small , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dividing line of American parties it is hard to say . President Cleveland is already almost party , and his Presidency rather " a condition " than " a theory . " With the election of a Democratic President , and the abandonment of the Force Bill , the war issues died , and appeals to war sentiment ceased to tell . An attempt to return to the McKinley tariff would renew the conflict between protection and free trade , but it seems unlikely from the general indications of opinion that such an attempt will be made . Commerce , above all things , wants certainty and peace . The Republican party is , in the main , the party of national aspiration and extension , to which its rival shows itself indifferent , and it may draw a new life from that source . But , if the great social movements now on foot continue to advance , the time must come when there will be a profound division between the party of State socialism and that of property and freedom . In that event , the party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the Democratic party is now composed , Jeffersonian tradition notwithstandiPg , while the present elements of the Republican party will be found chiefly on the side of property and freedom.
