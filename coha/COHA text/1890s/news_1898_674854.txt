txt That the Spanish Cadiz fleet is proceeding steadily eastward is n ) onger doubted here . Trusted agents of the Government on the shores of the Mediterranean are watching every movement of the ships and availing themselves of every trustworthy source of information . By the reckoning of the naval officers , the squadron should be now nearing Candia , south of Greece . At the rate they are sailing the squadron should reach Port Said , at the entrance to the Suez Canal , about Monday or Tuesday . Beyond this point it is not believed that the squadron will go , for it is confidently felt that the whole Spanish movement is nothing more than a spectacular display , gotten up to meet the irresistible demand of the Spanish populace , and particularly the clerical party , that something should be done to save the Philippines to Spain . There is a question whether the canal authorities will allow the heavy SrNarlish armored ships to risk the passage of the canal even if Admiral Camara is willing to undertake it . Their draught of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal and thus obstruct it to navigation indefinitely . But even if all these expectations are not well founded , - the naval officers are confident of Dewey 's ability successfully to resist an attack by the Spanish squadron , According to their calculations , the splendid double-turreted monitor Monterey is very near Manila under convoy of the Brutus , and her arrival may be expected - within two or three days . When she swings into line with Dewey 's squadron there is not an ironclad in Camara 's force that would care to stand before her . Then it must be remembered that long before the Cadiz squadron could possibly reach Manila Bay Gen. Merritt 's troops will be , in conjunction with the insurgents , in possession of all the forts surrounding the harbor and the Spanish guns , being manned by American artillerymen , will be expected to give a better account of themselves than they did when trained against Dewey . Slow Voyage for Camara . The Spanish fleet of four battleships and cruisers , three torpedo boats , and five transports must in the nature of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can scarcely reach the Philippines in less than forty days if it meet with no delays from acident or detention in coaling . It ' is assumed that the transports carry coal , for coal is not to be had in large quantities on the Suez route to Manila ; bad weather might wreck one or more of the transports , heavily loaded with troops The transports , it is imagined , will prove a great burden to Camara . If Admiral Dewey should adopt the suggestions that may be offered to him Camara will be very lonely and in grave doubt by the time he has reached the China Sea , toward the middle of August . It will be hospitable on the part of Dewey to move out from Manila with his fleet or part of It as soon as notified by a scout of the approach of Camara to give him a warm welcome . If Camara . Gets to Manila . Even the fastest of his troopships will be r.ble to run from the Monterey and Monad-. hock , but if they do run the Olympia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while some of the other ships address themselves to the task of capturing or sinking the slower troopships . The troopships are assumed to be carrying about 4,000 or 5,000 men , if the converted Normannia and Columbia are of the fleet . These vessels could run faster than any of the United States vessels , except the Olympia , but she could bring them both to a stop at once , if she were in their neighborhood . Upon meeting this fleet the American Admiral would have to inform Camara that circumstances over which he had no control would make it impossible to receive him in Manila Harbor , and that it would be necessary to exchange compliments outside , If Camara is heading for the Carolines or the Ladrones , with the idea of making those small groups the base for later operations against Manila , Admiral Dewey will no doubt be advised in advance to render occupation of these islands difficult and uncomfortable for large parties of soldiers . The Island of Pantellaria , at which point the fleet of Admiral Camara was seen last Wednesday , lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tunis . It is less than half the distance from Cadiz to Port Said , at the entrance to the Suez Canal . From Pantellaria to Port Said the fleet must cover a course of 1,300 miles , and if it approximates a speed of 10 knots an hour it should reach Port Said on Monday . If , as reported , the torpedo boat destroyers are being towed , the fleet would hardly maintain a. greater speed than 10 knots . From Port Said through the canal to Suez and through the Red Sea to Aden is about 1,500 miles ; from Aden to Colombo is 2,130 miles ; from Colombo to Singapore is 1,500 miles , and from Singapore to Manila is between 1,400 and 1,500 miles . This makes a total distance from Port Said of about 6,600 miles . Steaming at 10 knots an hour without interruption the voyage would take about twenty-eight days . Allowance must be made , however , for stops to coal , and this must add at least a week to the duration of the journey . On this basis it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
