SISTER DOLOROSA . BY JAMES LANE ALLEN , Author of " The White Cowl , " " Two Gentlemen of Kentucky , " etc . VI . -A a * TENDER night it was . The great sun at setting had looked with steadfast eye at the convent , standing lonely in the wide landscape , and had then thrown a final glance across the world towards the east ; and the moon had juickly risen , and hung about it the long silvery twilight of the heavenly watchfulness . The summer , too , which had been movint* farther and farther southward , now came &amp; *wly back , borne on warm airs that fanned the convent walls and sighed to its chaste lattices with the poetry of dead flowers and vanished songsters . But it sighed in vain . With many a prayer , with many a cross on pure brow and shoulder and breast , with many a pious kiss of crucifix , the convent slept . Only some little novice , lying like a flushed figure of Sleep on a couch of snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toying with her warm hair , broke some earthly dream of too much tenderness . Or they may merely have soothed the feverish feet of a withered nun , who clasped her dry hands in ecstasy as on her mortal , cavernous eyes there dawned a vision of the glories and rewards of Paradise . But no , not all slept . At an open xvindow on the eastern side of the convent stood the sleepless one , looking out into the largeness of the night like one who is lost in the largeness of her sorrow . Across the lawn , a little distance oW stood the church of the convent . The moonlight rested on it like a smile of peace , the elms blessed it with tireless arms , and from the zenith of the sky down towards the horizon there rested , on outstretched wings , rank after rank , and pinion brushing pinion , a host of white , angelic cloud-shapes , guarding the sacred portal . But she looked at it with timid yearning . Greater and greater had become the need of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confession and a prayer for pardon . All her peace was gone . She had been concealing her heart from the Mother Superior . She had sinned against her vows . She had impiously offended the Divine Mother . And to-day , after answering Gordon Helm 's letter in order 580 that she might defend her religion , she had acknowledged at last to her own heart that she loved him . But they would never meet again . To-morrow she would make full confession of all that had taken place . Beyond that miserable ordeal she dared not look into her own future . Lost in the fears and sorrows of such thoughts , long she stood looking out into the night , stricken with a sense of alienation from all riuman sympathy . For from the moment that she had made to herself the confession of her love for him , and resolved to make this confession to her injured Superior , she felt that she stood estranged from the entire convent ,  - -  Mother Superior , novice , and nun ,  --  as an object of reproach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorer yet grew her woman 's need , and a little way across the lawn stood the church , peaceful in the moonlight . Ah , the Divine pity If only first she might steal alone to the shrine of her whom most she had offended , and to an ear gracious to sorrow make confession of her frailty . At length , overcome with this desire , and gliding noiselessly out of the room , she passed down the moonlit hall , on each side of which the nuns were sleeping . She descended the stairway , took from the wall the key of the church , and then , softly opening the door , stepped out into the night . For a moment she paused , icy and faint with physical fear ; then , , passing like a swift shadow across the silvered lawn , she went round to the side entrance of the church , unlocked the door , and , entering quickly , locked herself inside . There she stood for some time with hands pressed tightly to her fluttering heart , until all bodily agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there came upon her that intense calmness with which the soul always enacts its great tragedies . Then slowly , very slowly , hidden now , and now visible where the moonlight entered the long Gothic windows , she passed across the chancel towards the shrine of her whom ancestral faith had taught her to believe divine ; and before the image of a Jewish woman - who herself , in all humanity , loved and married a carpenter nearly two thousand years ago , living beside him as blameless wife and becoming blameless mother to his children - this poor child , whose nature was as unstained as snow on the mountain // peaks , poured out her prayer to be forgiven the sin of her love . To the woman of the world , all the approaches of whose nature are defended by the intricacies of willfulness and the barriers of deliberate reserve ; to the woman of the world , who , in accordance with a standard of artificial society , within herself and to herself disavows and curbs and conceals the beginning and the growth of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end - it may seem incredible that there should have rooted itself so easily in the breast of one of her sex this flower of a fatal passion . But it should be remembered how unbefriended that bosom had been by any outpost of feminine self-consciousness ; how exposed it was through very belief in its unearthly consecration ; how , like some unwatched vase that had long been collecting the sweet dews and rains of heaven , it had been silently filling with those unbidden tendernesses that are shed from above as the best gifts of womanhood . Moreover , her life was unspeakably isolate . In the monotony of its routine a trifling event becomes an epoch ; a fresh impression stirs within the mind matehal for a chapter of inner history . Lifted far above all commonplace psychology of the passions , therefore , was the planting and the growth of an emotion in a heart like hers . Her prayer began . It began with the scene of her first meeting with Gordon in the fields , for from that moment she fixed the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverie and unsatisfied desires which she had been living before her innocent soul took no account . It had been unconscious ; it had never issued in any act that even her conscience had condemned . Therefore , beginning with that afternoon , she passed in review the history of her thoughts and feelings since then . The moon outside , flooding all the heavens with its beams , was not so intense a lamp as memory , now turned upon the inmost recesses of her mind . Nothing escaped detection . His words ; the scenes with him in the garden , in the field ; his voice , looks , gestures ; his anxiety and sympathy ; his passionate letter - all were now vividly recalled that they might henceforth be forgotten , and their influence was confessed that it might forever b* renounced . Her conscience stood beside her love as though it was some great fast-growing deadly plant in her heart , with deep-twisted roots and strangling tendrils , each of which to the smallest fiber must be uptorn so that not a germ should be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ? It is easy to ask to be rid of ignoble passions . They come upon us as momentary temptations and are abhorrent to our better selves ; but of all tragedies that are ever enacted within the theater of the human mind what one is so pitiable as that in which a pure being prays to be forgiven that one feeling of nature which is the revelation of all beauty , the secret of all perfection , the solace of the world , and the condition of immortality ? The passing of such a tragedy scars the nature of the penitent like the passing of an age across a mountain rock . If there had lingered thus long in Sister Dolorosa 's nature any upland of childhood snows , these vanished in that hour ; if any vernal belt of maidenhood , it felt the hot breath of that experience of the world and of the human destiny in it which quickly ages whatever it does not destroy . So that while she prayed there seemed to rise from within her and to take flight forever that spotless image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its place to stand the form of a woman older , altered , and inexorably set apart from all humankind by a clinging sorrow . At length her prayer ended and she rose. , it had not brought her the peace that prayer always brings to women ; for the confession of her love before the very altar - the mere coming into audience with the Eternal to renounce it - had for the first time given to it a vast reality , and set upon it the seal of irrevocable truth . It is when the victim is led to the altar of sacrifice that it turns its piteous eyes upon the sacrificing hand and utters its poor dumb cry for life ; and it was when Sister Dolorosa bared the breast of her humanity that it might be stabbed by the hand of her religion that she , too , though attempting to bless the stroke , felt the last pangs of that deep thrust . With such a. wound in the heart of her love she turned from the altar , walked once more across the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her . The night had grown more tender . The host of seraphic cloud-forms had fled across the sky ; and as she turned her eyes upward to the heavens there looked down upon her from their serene , untroubled heights only the stars , which never falter or digress from their forewritten courses . The thought came to her that never henceforth should she look up to them without being reminded of how her own will had wandered from its orbit . The moon rained its steady beams upon the symbol of the sacred heart on her bosom until it seemed to throb again with the agony of the crucifixion . Never again would she see it without the remembrance that her sin also had pierced it afresh . With what loneliness that sin had surrounded her ! As she had issued from the damp , chill atmosphere of the church the warm airs of the south , heavy with the spirit of the earth , quickened within her some long-sleeping // memory ; and with the yearning of stricken childhood she thought of her mother , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mother 's bosom was now a mound of dust . She looked across the lawn towards the convent where the Mother Superior and all the nuns were sleeping . To-morrow she would stand among them a greater alien than any stranger . No , she was alone ; among all the millions of human beings on the earth of God there was not one on whose heart she could have rested her own . Not one save him - him whose love had broken down all barriers that it might reach and infold her . And him she had repelled . A joy , new and indescribable , leaped within her that for him and not for another she suffered all this ; that with him she was at least bound forever in this tragedy of her fall . Slowly she took her way along the side of the church towards the front entrance , from which a paved walk led to the convent building . She reached the corner , she turned , and then she paused as one might pause who had come upon the beloved dead returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , leaning against one of the pillars , his face lifted upward so that the moonlight fell upon it . She had no time to turn back before he saw her . With a low cry of surprise and joy he sprang up and followed along the side of the church ; for instinctively she had begun to retrace her steps to the door , as though to lock herself inside . When he came up beside her , she paused . Both were trembling ; but when he saw the look of suffering on her face he forgot all else , and acting upon the impulse which had always impelled him to stand between her and unhappiness he now took both of her hands . " Pauline ! " He spoke with all the pleading love , all the depth of nature , that was in him . She had attempted to withdraw her hands , but at the sound of that once familiar name she suddenly bowed her head as the wave of memories and emotions passed over her ; then he quickly put his arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and kissed her . vii . IN recollections so overwhelming did the long interview which followed leave Gordon plunged on the next morning that he was unmindful of everything else ; and among the consequences of absent-mindedness was the wound that he gave himself by the careless handling of his gun . When Ezra had set out for the convent that aTorning Gordon had walked with him , saying that he would go to the station for a daily paper , but chiefly wishing to escape the house and be alone . They had reached in the fields a rotting fence , on each side of which grew briers and underwood . He had expected to climb this fence ; and as he stood beside it , speaking a few parting words to Ezra , he absentlythrust the butt of his gun between two of the lower rails , not noticing that the lock was sprung . Caught in the brush on the other side , it was discharged , making a wound in his left leg a little below the thigh . He turned to a deadly paleness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the faces of those who receive a wound , and fell . By main strength the old man lifted and bore him to the house and hurried off to the station , near which the neighborhood physician and surgeon lived . But he was away from home , and several hours passed before he came ; the means taken to stop the hemorrhage was ineffectual , the loss of blood had been very great , certain foreign matter had been carried into the wound , the professional treatment was unskillful , and septic fever followed , so that for many days Gordon 's life hung upon a little chance . But convalescence came at last , and with it days of clear , calm thinking . For he had not allowed news of his accident to be sent home or to his friends ; and except the old couple , the doctor , and the nurse whom the latter had secured , he had no company but his thoughts . No tidings had come to him of Sister Dolorosa since his accident ; and nothing had intervened to remove or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted him through fever and fantasy and dream since the night of their final interview . For it was then that he had first realized in how pitiless a tragedy her life had become entangled , and how conscience may fail to govern a woman 's heart in denying her the right to love but may still govern her actions in forbidding her to . marry . To plead with her had been to wound only the more deeply a nature that accepted even this pleading as a further proof of its own disloyalty and was forced by it into a state of more poignant humiliation . What wonder , therefore , if there had been opened fn his mind from that hour a certain wound which grew deeper and deeper , until by comparison his real wound seemed painless and *nsi gnificant . Nevertheless it is true that during this interviexv he had not been able to accept her decision as irreversible . The spell of her presence over him was too complete ; even his wish to rescue her from a lot henceforth unhappier still was too urgent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly to face the // thought of losing her , in the very hour of their first real meeting ; so that even in the despair of parting he had clung to the secret hope that little by little he might change her conscience , which now interposed the only obstacle between them . Even the next day , also , during the first few hours after he had been wounded , when life was rapidly flowing from him and all earthly ties seemed soon to be snapped , he had thought only of this tie , new and sacred , and had written to her . Poor boy ! - he had written , as with his heart 's blood , his brief ; pathetic appeal that she would come and be united to him before he died . In all ages of the world there have been persons , simple in nature and simple in their faith in another life , who have forgotten everything else in the last hour but the supreme wish to grapple to them for all eternity , and at whatever cost , those they love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for although in Kentucky the unrest of the century touching belief in the supernatural , and the many phases by which this belief expresses itself ; are not unknown , they had never affected him . He believed , as his fathers had believed , that to be united in this world in any relation is to be united in that relation , mysteriously changed yet mysteriously the same , in another . But this letter had never been sent . There had been no one to take it at the time ; and when Ezra returned with the physician he had fainted away from loss of blood . Then had followed the dressing of the wound , days of fever and unconsciousness , and then the assurance that he would get well . ( Thus nearly a month had passed , and for him a great change had come over the face of nature and the light of the world . With that all but preternatural calm of mind which only an invalid or a passionless philosopher ever obtains , he now looked back upon an episode which acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift his head from his pillow , there left his heart all that keen and joyous sense of human ties and pursuits with which it throbbed in a state of health . He lost the key to the motives and forces of his own character . But it often becomes the most momentous of all the psychological results of such a change in physiological condition that while the springs of feeling seem to dry up , the conscience remains sensitive , or even appears to burn more brightly , as a star through a rarer atmosphere . So that , lying thus in the poor farmhouse during dreary days , with his life half gone out of him and with only the sad image of her always before his eyes , he could think of nothing but his own cruel folly in having broken in upon her peace ; for perfect peace of some sort she must have had in comparison with what was now left her . Beneath his pillow he kept her letter , and as he often read it over he asked himself how he could ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter as that . If her heart belonged to him , did not her soul belong to her religion ? and if one or the other must give way , could it be doubtful with such a nature as hers which would come out victorious ? Thus he said to Hmself that any further attempt to see her could result only in greater suffering to them both , and that nothing was left him but what she herself had urged- to go away and resign her to a life from which he had too late found out that she could never be divorced . As soon as he had come to this decision he began to think of her as belonging only to his past . The entire episode became a thing of memory and irreparable incompleteness ; and with the conviction that she was lost to him her image passed into that serene , reverential sanctuary of our common nature where all the highest that we have grasped at and missed , and all the beauty that we have loved and lost , take the forms of statues around dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection . As he lay one morning revolving his altered purpose , Ezra came quietly into the room and took from a small table near the foot of the bed a waiter on which were a jelly-glass and a napkin . " She said I d better take these back this morning , " he remarked , looking at Gordon for his approval and motioning with his head towards that quarter of the house where Martha was supposed to be . " Wait awhile , will you , Ezra ? " he replied , looking at the old man with the dark , quiet eye of an invalid . " I think I ought to write a few lines this morning to thank them for all their kindness . Come back in an hour , will you ? " The things had been sent from the convent the day before ; for , from the time that news of the accident to the young stranger who had visited the convent some days before had reached the Mother Superior , there had regularly come to him delicate attentions which could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they were not inspired by /zcr and he thought that when the time came for him to write his thanks he xvould put into the expression of them something that would be understood by her alone - something that would st*ind for gratitude and a farewell . When Ezra left the room , with the thought of now doing this another thought came unexpectedly to Gordon . By the side of the bed there stood a small table on which were writ- // ing materials and a few books that had been taken from his valise . He stretched out his hand and opening one of the books took from it a letter which bore the address , " Sister Dolorosa . " It contained those appealing lines which he had written her on the day of his accident ; and with a calm , curious sadness he read them over and over , as though they had come from the impulse of some other heart . From the mere monotony of this exercise sleep over*ame him , and he had scarcely restored the letter to the envelop and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVhile he still lay asleep Ezra came quietly into the room again and took up the xvaiter with the jelly-glass and the napkin . Then he looked around for the letter that he was to take . He was accustomed to carry Gordon 's letters to the mail , and his eye now rested on the table where they were always to be found . Seeing one on it , he walked across , took it up and read the address , " Sister Dolorosa , " hesitated , glanced at Gordon 's closed eyes , and then , with an intelligent nod to signify that he could understand without further instruction , left the room and set out briskly for the convent . Sister Dolorosa was at the cistern filling a bucket with water when he came up and , handing her the letter , passed on to the convent kitchen . She looked at the envelop with indifference ; then she opened it and read the letter ; and then in an instant everything whirled before her eyes , and in her ears the water sounded loud as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she was gone - gone with a light , rapid step down the ayentie of elms , through the gate , across the meadows , out into the fields ; bucket and cistern , Mother Superior and sisterhood , vows and martyrs , zeal of Carmelite , passion of Christ , all forgotten . When , nearly a month before , news of the young stranger 's accident had reached the Mother Superior , in accordance with the rule which excludes from the convent all distraction of worldly affairs she had not made it known except to those who were to aid in carrying out her kindly plans for him . To Sister Dolorosa therefore the accident had just occurred , and now-now as she hastened to him-he was dying . During the intervea*ing weeks she had undergone by insensible degrees a deterioration of nature . Prayer had not passed her lips . She believed that she had no right to pray . Nor had she confessed . From such a confession as she had now to make certain new-born instincts of womanhood bade her shrink more deeply into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more scrupulous , if possible , of all outward duties , that no one might be led to discover the paralysis of her secret spiritual life . But there was that change in her which soon drew attention ; and thenceforth , in order to hide her heart , she began to practise with the Mother Superior little acts of self-concealment and evasion , and by and by other little acts of pretense and feigning until ,  - -  God pity her ! - being most sorely pressed by questions , when sometimes she would be found in tears or sitting listless with her hands in her lap like one who is under the spell of mournful fantasies , these became other little acts of positive deception . But for each of them remorse preyed upon her the more ruthlessly , so that she grew thin and faded , with a shadow of fear darkening always her evasive eyes . But this blight that had strangely fallen upon her only served to arouse deeper solicitude regarding her health , and all that care could do was done . This in turn brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from day to day , aimless and mute , and feeling herself apart from them all . What most held her apart , what most she deemed to put upon her the angry ban of Hcaven , was the consciousness that she still loved him , and that she was even bound to him the more inseparably since the night of their last meeting . For it was then that other emotions had been awakened which drew her to him in ways that love alone could not have done . These emotions had their source in the belief that she owed him reparation for the disappointment which she had brought upon his life . The recollection of his face when she had denied him all hope rose in constant reproach before her ; and since she held herself blamable that he had loved her at all , she took the whole responsibility for the unhappiness to him in which this had resulted . It was this added sense of having wronged him that cleft even conscience in her , and left her powerless even to struggle . But how to undo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bearing away into his life she knew not what burden of enticed and baffled hope . For there had been that in him , as there was that in her , which did not allow her to doubt that he really loved her ; she even thought him far nobler than he was , she so easily lifted him to the height of her own heroic ideals . On the morning when she was at the cistern ,  - -  for the Sisters of the order have among them such int*rchange of manual offices ,  --  if . as she read the letter that Ezra gave her , any one motive stood out clear in the stress of that terrible moment , it was , that having been false in her life to all other duties , she might at least be true to this . And that a duty it was she // never paused to doubt ; for she said to herself that the accident would not have occurred had he not remained in the neighborhood of the convent with the hope of seeing her again . Having thus been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one desire  --  to atone to him by any sacrifice of herself that would make it more peaceful . Beyond this all was void and dark within her as she hurried on , except the consciousness that by this act she separated herself from her order and terminated her religious life in utter failure and disgrace . The light , rapid step with which she had started soon brought her across the fields . As she drew near the house Martha , who had caught sight of her figure through the window , hastened to the door and stood awaiting her with eager satisfaction . But Sister Dolorosa merely approached and said : " Where is he ? For a moment the old woman , taken by surprise , did not answer although understanding ; for the two lay Sisters who had been wont to come always inquired for the invalid in this way . Then she pointed to a door at the opposite end of the porch , and with a sparkle of peculiar pleasure in her eyes she saw Sister Dolorosa cross and enter it . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then went back to the fireside where she sat upright and motionless with the red flannel pushed back from her listening ears . The room was dimly lighted through halfclosed shutters . Gordon lay asleep near the edge of the bed with his face turned towards the door . It might well have been thought the face of one dying . Her eyes rested on it a moment , and then with a stifled sob and moan she glided across the room and sank on her knees at the bedside . In the utter selfforgetfulness of her remorse , pity , and love she put one arm around his neck , she buried her head close beside his . He had awaked , bewildered , as he saw her coming towards him . He now took her arm from around his neck , pressed her hand again and again to his lips , and then laying it on his heart crossed his arms over it , letting one of his hands rest on her head . For a little while he could not trust himself to speak ; his love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , not knowing why she had come unless from some great sympathy for his sufferings , or perhaps to see him once more since he was now soon to go away , and not understanding any cause for her distress except the tragedy in which he had entangled her life , feeling only sorrow for her sorrow and wishing only by means of his last words to help her back to such peace as she still might win , he said to her with immeasurable gentleness : " I thought you would never come . I thought I should have to go away without seeing you again . They tell me it is not yet a month since the accident , but it seems to me so long- a lifetime I have lain here day after day thinking it all over , and I see things differently now - so differently ! That is why I wanted to see you once more . I wanted you to understand that I felt you had done right in refusing - in refusing to marry me . I wanted to ask you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let any thought of having made me unhappy add to the sorrow of your life . It is my fault , not yours . But I meant it ,  --  God knows I meant it ,  --  for the happiness of us both . I believed that your life was not suited to you . I meant to make you happy . But since you can not give your life up , I have only been unkind . And since you think it wrong to give it up , I am glad that you are so true to it . If you must live it , Heaven only knows how glad I am that you will not fail . And Heaven keep me so true to the duty in mine that I also shall not fail in it ! If we never meet again , we can always think of each other as living true to ourselves and to each other . Do n't deny me this . Even your vows will not deny me this . It will always keep us near each other , and it will bring us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken with entire repression of himself in the slow voice of an invalid , and on the stillness of the room each word had fallen with hard distinctness . But how , with the thought of the loss of her , by a painful effort he moved closer to the edge of the bed , put his arms around her neck , drew her face against his own , and continued : " But do not think it is easy to tell you this . Do not think it is easy to give you up . Do not think that I do not love you . 0 Pauline , not in another life , but in this - in this ! He could say no more ; and out of the fountain of his physical weakness tears rose to his eyes and fell drop by drop upon her veil . VIII . SISTER DoLoRosA had been missed from the convent . There had been inquiry growing ever more anxious , and then search growing ever more hurried . They found her bucket overturned at the cistern and near it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was gone . They sought her in every hidden closet , they climbed to the observatory and scanned the surrounding fields . All work was left unfinished , all prayer unended , as the news // spread throughout the vast building ; and as time went by and nothing was heard of her uneasiness became alarm , and alarm became a vague , immeasurable foreboding of ill . Each now remembered how strange of late had been Sister Dolorosa 's life and actions , and no one had the heart to name her own particular fears to any other or to read them in any other 's eyes . Time passed on , and all discipline in the convent was forgotten . The nuns began to pour out into the long corridors , and in tumultuous groups passed this way and that , seeking the Mother Superior . But the Mother Superior had gone to the church with the same impulse that in all ages has brought the human heart to the altar of God when stricken by peril or disaster ; and into the church they also gathered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novices , who had burst from their isolated quarter of the convent with a sudden contagion of fear . When , therefore , the Mother Superior rose from where she had been kneeling , turned , and in the dark church saw them all assembled close around her , pallid , anxious , disordered , and looking with helpless dependence to her for that assurance for which she had herself in helpless dependence looked to God , so unnerved was she by the spectacle that her strength failed her and she sank upon the steps of the altar , stretching out her arms once more in voiceless supplication towards the altar of the infinite helpftilness . But at that moment a little novice whom Sister Dolorosa loved and whom she had taught the music of the harp came running into the church , wringing her hands and crying . When she was half way down the aisle , in a voice that rang through the building she called out : " 0 Mother , she is coming ! Something has happened to her ! Her veil is gone ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were hurrying after her when a note of command , inarticulate but imperious , from the Mother Superior arrested every foot and drew every eye in that direction . Voice had failed her , but with a gesture full of dignity and reproach she waved them back , and supporting her great form between two of the nuns she advanced slowly down the aisle of the church and passed out by the front entrance . But they rorgot to obey her and followed ; and when she descended the steps to the bottom and made a sign that she would wait there , , on all the steps behind they stood grouped and crowded back to the sacred doors . Yes , she was coming ; coming up the avenue of elms ; coming slowly , as though her strength was almost gone . As she passed un der the trees on one side of the avenue she touched their trunks one by one for support . She walked with her eyes turned towards the ground and with the abstraction of one who has lost all purpose in walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she paused by one of the trees and supported herself against it , she raised her eyes and saw them all waiting to receive her on the steps of the church . For a little while she stood and surveyed the scene - the Mother Superior standing in front , her sinking form supported between two Sisters , her hands clasping the crucifix to her bosom ; behind her all the others , step above step , back to the doors , some looking at her with frightened faces , others with their heads buried on each other 's shoulders , and hiding somewhere in the throng the little novice , only the sound of whose sobbing revealed her presence . Then Sister Dolorosa took her hand from the tree , walked on quite steadily until she was several yards distant , and paused again . She had torn off her veil , and her head was bare and shining . She had torn the sacred symbol from her bosom , and through the black rent they could see the glistening whiteness of her breast . Comprehending them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen , she looked into the face of the Mother Superior and began to speak in a voice utterly forlorn , as of one who has passed the limits of suffering : " Mother ! " Mother ! " She passed one hand slowly across her forehead , as if to brush away some cloud from her brain , and for the third time she began to speak : " Mother ! Then she paused , pressed both palms quickly to her temples , and turned her eyes in bewildered appeal towards the Mother Superior . But she did not fall . With a cry that might have come from the heart of the boundless pity the Mother Superior broke away from the restraining arms of the nuns and rushed forward and caught her to her bosom . Ix . rilE day had come when Gordon was well enough to go home . As he sat giving directions to Ezra , who was awkwardly packing his valise , he looked over the books , papers , and letters that lay on the table near the bed . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled expression , as he finished his search . Then he added quietly , in a tone of helpless entreaty : " You could n't have taken it to the // station and mailed it with the others , could you , Ezra ? It was not to go to the station . It was to have gone to the convent . " The last sentence he uttered rather to his own thought than for the ear of his listener . " I look it to the convent , " said Ezra , stoutly , raising himself from over*the valise in the middle of the floor . " I did n't lake it to the station . " Gordon wheeled on him , giving a wrench to his wound which may have caused the groan that burst from him and left him white and trembling . " You took it to the convent ! Great God , Ezra ! When ? " The day you told me to take it , " replied Ezra , simply . " The day the Sister came to see you . ' ' " 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faithful countenance of the old man , and feeling that he had not so much as the right to censure him . Noxv for the first time he comprehended the whole significance of what had happened . He had never certainly known what motive had brought her to him that day . He had never been able to understand why , having come in a state of evident emotion , she had gone away with such abruptness . Scarcely had he begun to speak to her when she had withdrawn her arm from around his neck and strangely shrunk from him ; and scarcely had he ceased speaking when she had left the room without a word , and without his having so much as seen her face . Slowly now the sad truth forced itself upon his mind that she had come in answer to his entreaty . She must have thought his letter just written , himself just wounded and dying . It was as if he had betrayed her into the utmost expression of her love for him and in that moment had coldly admonished her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her the most sacred obligation of her life , and in return he had given her an exhortation to be faithful to her vows . He went home to one of the older secluded country-places of the blue-grass region not far from Lexington . His all but fatal illness saved to account for a strange gravity and sadness in him . XVhen the winter had passed and spring had come , bringing him perfect health again , this sadness only deepened . For health had brought back the ardor of life . All the glowing colors of the world returned ; and with these there flowed back into his heart , as waters flow back into a well that has gone dry , the perfect love of youth and strength with which he had loved her and tried to win her at first . And with this love of her came back the first complete realization of all that he had lost ; and with this pain , that keenest pain of having been most unkind to her when he had meant and striven to be kindest . He now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained some clear headland looks down upon a valley so dark and overhung with mist that he can not trace his own course across it . He was no longer in sympathy with that mood of self-renunciation which had influenced him in their last interview . He charged himself with having given up too easily ; for might he not , after all , have won her ? Might he not , little by little , have changed her conscience , as little by little he had gained her love ? Would it have been possible , he asked himself again and again , for her ever to come to him as she had come that day had not her conscience approved ? Of all his torturing thoughts none cost him greater suffering than his living over in imagination what must have happened to her since then - the humiliation , perhaps public exposure , followed by penalties and sorrows of which he durst not think , and certainly a life more infinitely unrelieved in its gloom of vision and desolation of heart . In the summer his father 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winter was passed in settling the business of the est*tte , and before the spring passed again Gordon found himself at the head of affairs , and stretching out before him , calm and clear , the complete independence of his new-found manhood . His life was his own to make it what he would . As fortunes go in Kentucky he was wealthy , his farm being among the most beautiful of all the beautiful ones which make up that land , and his homestead being dear through family ties and those intimations of fireside peace which lay closest the heart of his ideal life But , amid all his happiness , that one lack which made all the rest appear lacking , that vacancy which nothing would fill ! The beauty of the rich land henceforth brought him always the dreamlike recollection of a rough poor country a hundred miles away . Its quiet homesteads with the impression they create of sweet and simple lives reminded him only of a convent standing lonely and forbiddingin the wide landscape . The calm liberty of woods and fields , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religion , which were to him the best gifts of his State , his country , and his time , forced on him perpetual contrast to the ancient confinement in which *she languished . Still he threw himself resolutely into his duties . In all that he did or planned he felt a certain sacred and uplifting force added to his life by that high bond through which he had sought to unite their sundered pathways. // But , on the other hand , the haunting pain of the thought of what might have befallen her since became a corrosive care , and began to eat out the heart of all his resolute purposes . So that when the long , calm summer had passed again and autumn had come , bringing to him lonelier days in the brown fields , lonelier rides on horseback through the gorgeous woods , and lonelier evenings beside his rekindled hearthstone , he could bear the suspense no longer and*made up his mind to go back , if but to hear tidings whether she yet was living in the convent . He realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again speak to her of his love . He had put himself on the side of her conscience against his own cause ; but he felt that he owed it to himself to dissipate all uncertainty regarding her fate . This done , he could then return , however sadly , and take up the duties of his life with better heart . x . ONE Sunday afternoon he got off again at the little station . From one of the few rustic loungers on the platform he learned that old Ezra and Martha had gone the year before to live with a son in a distant State , and that their scant acres had been absorbed in the convent domain . Slowly he took his way across the somber fields . Once more he reached the brown footpath and the edge of the pale , thin corn . Once more the summoning whistle of the quail came sweet and clear from the depths of a neighboring thicket . Silently in the reddening west were rising the white cathedrals of the sky . It was on yonder hilltop that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening light . Overwhelmed by the memories which the place evoked , he passed on towards the convent . The first sight of it in the distance smote him with a pain so sharp that a groan escaped his lips , as from a reopened wound . It was the hour of the vesper service . Entering the church , he sat where he had sat before . How still it was , how faint the autumnal sunlight stealing in through the sainted windows , how motionless the dark company of nuns seated on one side of the nave , how rigid the white rows of novices on the other ! With sad fascination of search his eyes roved among the black-shrouded devotees . She was not there . In the organ-loft above , a voice , poor and thin , began to pour out its wavering little tide of song . She was not there , then . Had her soul already gone home to Heaven ? Noiselessly from behind the altar the sacristine had come forth to light the candles . With eyes strained and all the heart gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . A slight , youthful figure it was - slighter , as though worn and wasted ; and the hands which so firmly bore the long taper looked too white and fragile to have upheld aught heavier than the stalk of a lily . With infinite meekness and reverence she moved hither and thither about the shrine , as though each footfall were a step nearer the glorious Presence , each breath a prayer . One by one there sprang into being beneath her touch of love the silvery spires of sacred flame . No angel of the night ever more softly lighted the stars of heaven . And it was thus that he saw her for the last time - folded back to the bosom of that faith from which it was left him to believe that he had all but rescued her to love and happiness , and set as a chastening admonition to tend the mortal fires on the altar of eternal service . Looking at her across the vast estranging gulf of destiny , heartbroken he asked himself in his poor yearning way whether she longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For answer he had only the assurance given in her words , which now rose as a benediction in his memory : " If He will deign to hear the ceaseless , fervent petition of one so erring , he will not leave you unhappy on account of that love for me which in this world it will never be allowed me to return . " One highest star of adoration she kindled last , and then , turned and advanced down the aisle . He was sitting close to it , and as she came towards him , with irresistible impulse he bent forward to meet her , his lips parted as though to speak , his eyes implored her for recognition , his hands were instinctively moved to attract her notice . But she passed him with unuplifted eyes . The hem of her dress all but swept across his foot . In that intense moment , which compressed within itself the joy of another meeting and the despair of an eternal farewell - in that moment he may have tried to r*d through her face and beyond it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffered . To any one else on her face rested only that beauty , transcending description , which is born of the sorrow of earth and the peace of God . Mournful as was this final vision of her and touched with remorse , he could yet bear it away in his heart for long remembrance not untempered by consolation . He saw her well ; he saw her faithful ; he saw her bearing the sorrows of her lot with angelic sweetness . Through years to come the beauty of this // scene might abide with him , lifted , above the realm of all mortal changes by the serenity of her immovable devotion . XI . IHERE was thus spared Gordon all knowi*c1ge of the great change that had taken place regarding Sister Dolorosa within the councils of the order ; nor perhaps was he ever to learn of the other changes , more*eventful still , that were now fast closing in upon her destiny . When the Creator wishes to create a woman the beauty of whose nature is to prefigure the types of an immortal world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent love . The contravention of this faculty has time after time resulted in the most memorable tragedies that have ever saddened the history of the race . He had given to the nature of Pauline Cambron two strong , unwearying wings - the pinion of faith and the pinion of love . It was his will that she should soar by the use of both .. But the use of one had been denied her ; and the vain and bewildered struggles which marked her life thenceforth were as those of a bird that should try to rise into the air with one of its wings bound tightly against its breast . When she arose from the illness which followed upon the events of that terrible day she took t4wards her oxvn conduct the penitential attitude enjoined by her religion . There is little need to lay bare all that followed . She had passed out of her soft world of heroic dreams into the hard world of unheroic reality . She had chosen a name to express her sympathy with the sorrows of the world , and the sorroxvs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white dawn of the imagination she had stepped into the heat and burden of the day . Long after all penances and prayers were over , long after she might have felt herself forgiven by all others , she was as far as ever from that forgiveness which comes from within . It is not characteristic of a nature such as hers to win pardon so easily for such an offense as she considered hers . Indeed , as time passed on , all the powers of her being seemed concentered more and more in one impassioned desire to expiate her sin ; for , as time passed on , more and more , despite all penances and prayers , she realized that she still loved him . As she pondered this , she said to herself that l ) eace would never come unless she should go elsewhere and begin life over in some place that was free from the memories of her fall . There was so much to remind her of him . She could not go into the garden without recalling the day when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cross the threshold of the church without being reminded that it was the scene of her unfaithfulness and of her exposure . The graveyard , the footpath across the fields , the observatory-all were full of disturbing images . And therefore she besought the Mother Superior to send her away to some one of the missions of the order , thinking that thus she would win forgetfulness of him and singleness of heart . But while the plan of doing this was yet being considered by the Mother Superior there happened one of those events which seem to fit into the crises of our lives as though determined by the very laws of fate . The attention of the civilized world had not yet been fixed upon the heroic labors of the Belgian priest Father Damien among the lepers of the island of Molokai . But it has been stated that near the convent are the monks of La Trappe . Among these monks were friends of the American priest Brother Joseph , who for years was one of Father Damien 's assistants ; and to these friends this priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described at great length the life of the leper settlement and the work of the small band of men and women who had gone to labor in that remote and awful vineyard . The contents of these letters were made known to the ecclesiastical superior of the convent , and one evening he made them the subject of a lecture to the assembled nuns and novices , dwelling with peculiar eloquence upon the devotion of the three Franciscan Sisters who had become outcasts from all human society that they might nurse and teach leprous girls , until inevitable death should overtake them also . Among that breathless audience of women there was one soul on whom his words fell with the force of a message from the Eternal . Here then , at last , was offered her a pathway by following meekly to the end of which she might perhaps find blessedness . The real Man of Sorrows appeared to stand in it and to beckon her on to the abodes of those abandoned creatures whose sufferings he had with peculiar pity so often stretched forth his hand to heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be allowed to go it was at first refused , being regarded as a momentary impulse ; but months passed , and at intervals , always more earnestly , she renewed her request . It was pointed out to her that when one has gone among the lepers there is no return : the consequence is either lifelong banishment or death from leprosy , usually at the end of a few years . But always her reply was : " In the name of Christ , Mother , let me go ! " Meantime it had become clear to the Mother Superior that some change of scene must be made . The days of Sister Dolorosa 's // usefulness in the convent were too plainly over . It had not been possible in that large household of women to conceal the fact of her unfaithfulness to her vows . As one black veil whispered to another , as one white veil communed with its attentive neighbor , little by little events were gathered and pieced together until , in different forms of error and rumor , the story became known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the garden with the young stranger on the day of his visiting the convent . Others had heard of his lying wounded at the farmhouse . Still others were sure that under pretext of visiting old Martha she had often met him in the fields . And then the scene on the steps of the church , when she had returned soiled , and torn , and fainting . So that from the day on which she arose from her illness and began to go about the convent she was singled out as a target for those small arrows which the feminine eye directs with such faultless skill at one of its own sex . With scarcely perceptible movements they would draw aside when passing her , as though to escape corrupting contact . Certain ones of the younger Sisters , who were jealous of her beauty , did not fail to drop innuendoes for her to overhear . And upon some of the novices , whose minds were still wavering between the Church and the world , it was thought that her example might have a dangerous influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible that the head of the order may have thought it best that this ruined life should take on the halo of martyrdom , from which fresh luster would be reflected upon the annals of the Church . However this may be , after about eighteen months of waiting , during which correspondence was held with the Sandwich Islands , it was determined that Sister Dolorosa should be allowed to go thither and join in the labors of the Franciscan Sisters . From the day when consent was given she passed into that peace with which one ascends the scaffold or awaits the stake . It was this look of peace that Gordon had seen on her face as she moved hither and thither about the shrine . Only a few weeks after he had thus seen her the day came for her to go . Of all who took part in the scene of farewell she was the most unmoved . A month later she sailed from San Francisco for Honolulu , and in due time there came from Honolulu to the Mother Superior the following letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauline Cambron . XII . KALAWAO , MoLoKAI , HAWAIIAN ISLANDS , January i , i88- . DEAR MOTHER I entreat you not to let the sight of this strange handwriting , instead of one that must be so familiar , fill you with too much alarm . I hasten to assure you that before my letter closes you will understand why Sister Dolorosa has not written herself . Since the hour when the vessel sailed from the American port bearing to us that young life as a consecrated helper in our work among these suffering outcasts of the human race I know that your thoughts and prayers have followed her with unceasing anxiety ; so that first of all things I should give you tidings that the vessel reached Honolulu in safety . I should tell you also that she had a prosperous voyage , and that she is now happy-far happier than when she left you . I know likewise that your imagination has constantly hovered about this island , and that you have pictured it to yourself as the gloomiest of all spots in the universe of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove this impression by giving you some description of the island itself , which has now become her unchanging home . The island of Molokai , then , on which the leper settlement has been located by the Government , is long , and shaped much like the leaf of the willow tree . All the Sandwich Islands , as you well know , are a group of volcanoes out of which the fires have for the most part long since died . Molokai , therefore , is really but a mountain of cooled lava , half of which perhaps is beneath the level of the sea . The two leper villages are actually situatec* in the very cup of an ancient crater . The island is very low along the southern coast , and slopes gradually to its greatest altitude on the northern ridge , from which the descent to the sea is in places all . but perpendicular . It is between the bases of these northern cliffs and the sea that the villages are built . In the rear of them is a long succession of towering precipices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in front of them there is a coast line so rough with pointed rocks that as the waves rush in upon them spray is often thrown to the height of fifty or a hundred feet . It is this that makes the landing at times so dangerous , and at other times , when a storm has burst , so fatal . So that shipwrecks are not unknown , dear Mother , and sometimes add to the sadness of life in this place . But from this description you would get only a mistaken idea of the aspect of the island . It is sunny and full of tropical loveliness . The lapse of centuries has in places covered the lava with exquisite verdure . Soft breezes blow here , about the dark cliffs hang purple atmospheres , and above them drift pink and white clouds . Sometimes the whole island is veiled in golden mist . Beautiful streams fall down its green precipices into the sea , and the sea itself is of the most brilliant blue . In its depths are growths of pur* white corals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I should speak no longer of the island , but of the people instead , I could perhaps do something still further to dissipate the dread with which you and all other strangers must regard us . The inhabitants are a simple , generous , happy race , and // there are many spots in this world-many in Europe and Asia , perhaps some in your own landwhere the scenes of suffering and death are more poignant and appalling . The lepers live for the most part in decent white cottages . Many are the happy faces that are seen among them so that , strange as it may seem , healthy people would sometimes come here to live if the laws did not forbid . So much has Christianity done that one may now be buried in consecrated ground . If all this appears worldly and frivolous , dear Mother , forgive me . If I have chosen to withhold from you news of her of whom alone I know you are thinking , it is because I have wished to give you as bright a picture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what is to follow . So that , before I go further , I shall pause again to describe to you one spot which is the loveliest of all on the island . About a mile and a half from the village of Kalawao there is a rocky point which is used as an irregular landing-place when the sea is wild . just beyond this point there is an inward curve of the coast , making an inlet of the sea , and from the water 's edge there slopes backward into the bosom of the island a deep ravine . Down this ravine there falls and winds a gleaming white cataract , and here the tropical vegetation grows most beautiful . The trees are wreathed with moist creepers , the edges and crevices of the lava blocks are fringed with ferns and moss . Here bloom the wild ginger and the crimson lehua . Here grow trees of orange and palm and punhala groves . Here one sees the rare honey-bird with its plumage of scarlet velvet , the gold*n plover , and the beautiful white boatswain-bird wheeling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scene in some fairy tale . When storms roll in from the sea the surf flows far back into this ravine , and sometimes , after the waters have subsided , a piece of wreckage from the ocean is left behind . Forgive me once more , 0 dear Mother , if again I seem to you so idle and unmeaning in my words . But I have found it almost impossible to go on ; and l ) esides I think you will thank me , after you have read my letter through , for telling you firstof this place . From the day of our first learning that there was a young spirit among you who had elected for Christ 's sake to come here and labor with us we had counted the days till she should arrive . The news had spread throughout the leper settlement . Father Damien had made it known to the lepers in Kalawao , Father Wendolin had likewise told it among the lepers in Kaulapapa , and the Protestant ministers spoke of it to their flocks . Thus her name had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer had been offered up for her safety . Once a week there comes to Molokai from Honolulu a little steamer called Mokolli . When it reached here last Saturday morning it brought the news that just before it sailed from Honolulu the vessel bearing Sister Dolorosa had come into port . She had been taken in charge by the Sisters until the Mokolli should return and make the next trip . I should add that the steamer leaves at about five o'clock in the afternoon , and that in ordinary weather it usually readhes here at about dawn of the following morning . 59 ' And now , dear Mother , I beseech you to lay my letter aside . Do not read farther now . Lay it aside , and do not take it up again until you have sought in prayer the consolation of our divine religion for all the sorrows of our lives . I shall believe that you have done this , and that as you now go on with the reading of my letter you have gained the fortitude to hear what I have scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor way I have sought to prepare you ! As it was expected that the steamer would reach the island about dawn on Saturday morning , as usual , it had been arranged that many of us should be at the landing-place to give her welcome . But about midnight one of the terrific storms which visit this region suddenly descended , enveloping the heavens , which had been full of the light of the stars , in impenetrable darkness . We were all sleepless with apprehension that the vessel would be driven upon the rocks- such was the direction of the storm - long before it could come opposite the villages ; and a few hours before day Father Damien , accompanied by Father Conrardi , Brother James , and Brother Joseph , went down to the coast . Through the remaining hours of the night they watched and waited , now at one point and now at another , knowing that the vessel could never land in such a storm . As the dawn broke they followed up the coast until they came opposite that rocky point of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here they were met by two or three men who were drenched with the sea and just starting towards the villages , and from them they learned that an hour or two before the steamer had been driven upon the hidden rocks of the point . It had been feared that it would soon be sunk or dashed to pieces , and as quickly as possible a boat had been put off in which were the leper girls that were being brought from Honolulu . There was little hope that it would ever reach the shore , but it was the last chance of life . In this boat , dear Mother , Sister Dolorosa also was placed . Immediately afterwards a second boat was put off containing all the others that were on board . Of the fate of the first boat they had learned nothing . Their own had been almost immediately capsized , and so far as they knew they were the sole survivors . The Hawaiians are the most expert of swimmers , being almost native to the sea ; and since the distance was short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for any other . During the early hours of the morning , which broke dark and inexpressibly sad for us , a few bodies were found washed ashore , among them those of two leper girls of Honolulu . But our search for her long proved unavailing . At length Father Damien suggested that we follow up the ravine which I have described , and it was thither that he and brother Joseph and I accordingly went . Father Damien thought it well that I should go with them . It was far inlantl , dear Mother , that at last we found her . She lay outstretched on a bare , black rock of lava which sloped upward from the sea . 1-ler naked white feet rested on the green moss that fringed its lower edge , and her head was sheltered from the burning sun , which had now come forth , by branches of ferns . Almost over her eyes , the // lids of which were stiff with the salt of the ocean , there hung a spray of white poppies . It was as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of her face , so young and having in it the purity and the peace of Heaven , we all knelt down around her without a word , and for a while we could do nothing but weep . Surely nothing so spotless was ever washed ashore on this polluted island . If I sinned , 1 pray to be forgiven , but 1 found a strange joy in thinking that the corruption of this terrible disease had never been laid upon her . Heaven had accepted in advance her faithful spirit , and had spared her the long years of bodily suffering . At Father Damien 's direction Brother Joseph returned to the village for a bier and for four lepers who should still be strong enough tobear it . When they came we laid her on it and bore her back to the village , where Mother Marianne took the body in charge and prepared it for burial . How shall I describe her funeral ? The lepers were her pall-bearers . The news of the shipwreck had quickly spread throughout the settlement , and these simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hour . When the time arrived , it seemed that all who could walk had come to follow her to the churchyard . It was a moving sight  --  the long , wavering train of that deathstricken throng , whose sufferings had so touched the pity of our Lord when he was on earth , and the desolation of whose fate she had come to lessen . There were the young and the old alike , Protestants and Catholics without distinction , children with their faces so strangely aged with ravages of the leprosy , those advanced in years with theirs so mutilated and marred . Others , upon whom the leprosy had made such advance that they were too weak to walk , sat in their cottage doors and lifted their husky voices in singing that wailing native hymn in which they bemoan their hopeless fate . Some of the women after a fashion of their own wore large wreaths of blue blossoms and green leaves about their withered faces . And it was thus that we lepers- I say we lepers because I am one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease- it was thus that we lepers followed her to the graveyard in the rock by the sea , where Father Damien with his own hands had helped to dig her grave . And there , dear Mother , all that is mortal of her now rests . But we know that long ere this she has heard the words , " I was sick and ye visited me . " Mother Marianne would herself have written , but she was called away to the leprosery . May the hope of meeting her in Paradise sustain you ! SISTER AGATHA .
