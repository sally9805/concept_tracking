txt The argument which is to lead to a determination concerning the constitutional status of the two Senates of New-Jersey Nmas continued before the Supreme Court to-day . Allen L. , counsel for Robert Adrain , President of the Democratic Senate , finished his address and ex-Judge Stevens of counsel for the State began his address .

The writ asked for as against President Rogers should , therefore , also issue . Mr. Stevens 's argument created something of a sensation , inasmuch as he held that neither Senate was legally organized , and that what the Democratic Senators did on the day of organization , except during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a backdown on the part of the State . which has heretofore supported the Democrats in their contention . Judge Stevens will continue speaking . tomorrow .
