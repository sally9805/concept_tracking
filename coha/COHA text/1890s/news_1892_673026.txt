txt One great American industry has unquestionably been benefited by the muchabused bill of .. nY , and that is the apple-pie industry . Statistics show that the cost of production of apple pie has fallen off largely , that the consumption has increased , and . that the ruling market rate of 10 cents for a two-and-a-hall-cent wedge of this delightful edible has remained unchanged . Dried apples , quoted on June 1 , 1889. at 15 cents , are now quoted at 10 cents , and , according to experts , are quite as dry as they were under the former rating . There is absolutely no ground for the assertion of partisan cavilers , say the experts , that the dryness a apples has been adulterated . In fact , an assertion of this sort is manifestly absurd . they claim , for the minute a dried apple is adulterated it ceases to be a dried apple , and , statistically , is perfotce entered on the books of the Nation under a Indic/illy different head . There is a great seal in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disposed to fly off the handle because the general public is not allowed to share in the benefits which accrue from the protection of this industry are shortsighted . They are short-sighted because they fail to see , that they really do share indirectly in the prosperity of the applepie maker . Their share , it is true , is not measured in dross , but it exists nevertheless . It is measured . in pie . It exists in the fact that there is more apple pie to be had . under the new schedules than under the old . It stands to reason that a manufacturer who can make a profit of 9 cents on every ten-cent pie manufactured . will produce more pies than he cared to risk when his profit was but 6 cents on each pie . In other words , the supply of pie , which no one can well deny never really equaled. the demand , has been largely increased , and . is to-day more nearly adequate to the public needs . Gastonberry 's Manual for 1883 states that in New-England alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December for that year . The demand was much larger , being estimated at 10,000,000 in round numbers . In December . 1889 , the , same section consumed 13,561,934 pies , as against an estimated . demand . for over 15,000,000  --  a very fair increase , but nothing in comparison with the increased consumption in the last three years , for in December , 1891 , the pie output was 23,961,347 , and the demand was for but 24,000,300 , ( estimated . ) Those figures point to one fact only , andthat is that in the matter of pies we are more prosperous to-day than we ever were before , and that since the enactment of the bill our prosperity in this field has galloped , where a decade ago it was merely crawling hopelessly along . It is a significant fact that the Providence Pie Trust , which is now preparing its stock for December , 1892 , is drying apples and rolling crust for no less than 32.000,000 platters for the Massachusetts and Rhode Island . trade alone . These figures tell their own story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
