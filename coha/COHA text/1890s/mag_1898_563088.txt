txt THE most important detail , perhaps , in connection with the organization of our volunteer troops , is the development , selection and appointment of their officers . At the beginning of the war with Mexico in 1846 we were able to officer our comparatively small force of raw troops very largely with graduates of the Military Academy , or with men who had obtained military training in our army . The troops being thns commanded by experienced soldiers were trained with thoroughness and despatch , and brought that war to a successful conclusion in a remarkably short space of time , considering the difficulties they had to encounter , and the preponderating forces arrayed against them . We are able to look back upon that campaign with intense pride , which is not diminished when we compare our experience in Mexico with that of the French army in the same country in 1863 . In the war of 186 1-5 , however , our experience was different . Owing to the fewness of our trained officers , and to the enormous numbers of troops we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , we had many regiments which , when organized , were found to contain absolutely no officers or men fitted for instructors . As from the nature of things , in the case of any future levJe en masse , the time for preparation will be very short , disaster is liable to ' overtake us , if we do not have men who are able to command and quickly train raw troops . Fortunately for this country , while we are debarred in time of peace from educating soldiers on as large a scale as prevails abroad , we are not prevented from educating officers , and of this fact it behooves us to take the utmost advantage . // It is not to be doubted that , in case of attack or invasion , the patriotism and military spirit of our citizens would demand the immediate raising of an army sufficient in size for all possible contingencies , and that at least 400,000 men would thus be embodied in the ranks , in addition to our regular army and active militia . For such an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , we should need 16,000 combatant officers . We may then safely say that 16,000 well-mustered officers should always be at our disposal , for even with this number we will be greatly inferior to other first-class , and even to second-class , nations in the number of available military organizers and drill instructors . We will be able to obtain our officers and instructors from three different sourcee : ( 1 . ) From the Military Academy ; ( 2. ) from the Regular Army ; ( 3. ) from the National Guard . The Military Academy , as a factor in our probkm of national defence , has hardly re . eived the attention it deserves . From the debates in Congress , the reports of the - Secretaries of War , and the messages of the Presidents , in the early days of the Republic , it is clear that the Academy was intended , not so much to accomplish what at present is almost its sole function  --  to supply enough officers to fill the vacancies in the army-as to provide a reserve of officers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train our raw levies . In 1815 , with a population one-tenth the present census enumeration , the maximum number of cadets was fixed at 260 , as against 371 to-day . Instead of increasing the size of the Military Academy as the needs of the country enlarged , its original purpose has been lost sight of , until now it is scarcely large enough to supply the ordinary vacancies . And this , in spite of the fact that the Academy costs annually little more than does a regiment of cavalry or infantry , while the benefit derived from it as a part of the army is a hundred-fold greater . Our history , as written by hosts of unprejudiced writers , will show that , as officers , instructors and disciplinarians , West Pointers , as a whole , are far superior to the military talent we can produce in any other way , and that they , more than any , are eminently suited to become the organizers of our volunteer armies . I will content myself with quoting General Scott , one of our greatest soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I give it as my fixed opinion that but for our graduated cadets // the war between the United States and Mexico might , and probably would , have lasted some four or five years , whereas , in two campaigns , we conquered a great country without the loss of a single battle or skirmish . " We have now perhaps 1,450 graduates who would be available in time of war , of whom about 1,300 are in the army . Instead of limiting ourselves to this restricted number , it would be well if 8,000 of the 16,000 trained officers and instructors required for volunteers were graduates of a National Military Academy . This could be accomplished in a few years by increasing the number of cadets authorized by law from 371 to 2,200 , and this in turn could be done by providing three Academies , the existing one at West Point and two others . The fact that all these cadets would not remain in the army would not affect the efficiency of their instruction any more than like conditions have affected the value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his education the graduate of the Military Academy should always be at the service of the government , and this should be made a matter of law as well as of sentiment . To keep alive their interest in military science , the government should organize a reserve of officers , to which all graduates of the Military Academies not in the army should belong . In this reserve officers should serve without pay , being indemnified therefor , and for their temporary exclusion from active service , by promotion ( after examination ) at stated periods . This reserve of officers is of the utmost importance as a necessary adjunct in our system of national defense . Another source from which we may gain our instruction of volunteers is the ranks of the regular army . It is well known that in recent years the class of men enlisting in the regular army has greatly improved . Much of this improvement is due to improved conditions ( food , clothing , barracks , etc. ) , though it is partly due to the fact that promotion from the ranks has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men we probably discharge , on expiration of the three years ' term of service , about 13,000 men per year , of whom perhaps , 1,000 are non-commissioned officers . A large proportion of these soldiers are very intelligent ; all have received a thorough and complete military training . Of the non-commissioned // officers many are eminently fitted as instructors and officers of volunteers . We commit a great fault , and one that will not fail to be serious in its consequences , in not developing this talent and making it available . Any non-commissioned officer or man who shows abilliy as a drill master should receive credit for it and be given a parchment certificate to that effect , signed by his company commander , who should be required to state his relative proficiency as an instructor in the school of the soldier , school of the company , etc. , marching , camping , cooking , target practice , guard duty , etc . In order to give more non-commissioned officers , or men , experience and confidence in drilling , recruits , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-commissioned officers rotate as instructors . In the noncommissioned officer 's record in the description book , should be noted , at the time , any tours of duty as drill instructor , with the proficiency attained . In case any non-commissioned officer is believed on discharge to be competent to act as a subaltern officer of volunteers , he should be given a practical and theoretical examination by a board of officers , who should sign a further eertificate to that effect . These certificates should be registered at Washington , where the man 's address should be preserved . All this can be accomplished with ease , without resort to Congress , by a simple order of the War Department . The military talent developed in our army would then be made available in time of war . Certificates as instructors would bring warrants as non-commissioned officers in the volunteers to discharged men . Certificates of competency as instructors and as subaltern officers would go far toward securing commissions . Such certificates would be highly prized by the recipients , and would surely be recognized by governors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-commissioned officers of the regular army were in great demand as instructors of volunteers . It is to be deplored that so many highly competent men have been hitherto discharged from the army without any such recognition of their peculiar talents , so valuable in time of war . The privilege of receiving the certificates I recommend might well be extended , however , to men who have been discharged , and who , having applied for them , are found competent by boards . Such a system would be advantageous to the regular army , by causing what is now often a distasteful task to be sought by // non-commissioned officers and privates ; and by developing talent which is now latent or not apparent ; and it would also result in the more thorough instruction of our regular army recruits . It would further establish as a principle , which is not now clearly recognized , that one important feature of our regular army is to spread abroad military acquirement which will be available in time of war . Discharged non-commissioned officers of superior ability , who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting their efficiency , to obtain commissions in the army , should have the privilege of applying for and obtaining , after passing proper examinations , commissions in the reserve of officers recommended in connection with an increase of the Military Academy . Another source from which we will , in time of war , obtain officers and instructors for our raw levies is the National Guard . It is not to be expected that we can obtain as uniformly competent instructors from this source as from the Military Academy or the regular army . There is , unfortunately , much variation in the degrees of thoroughness attained in training and discipline by different regiments of the National Guard and in different States . In some organizations , false ideas of discipline are allowed to be accepted that would rather detract from the value of the men as volunteers . Jn many cases the military instruction received is exceedingly limited , not extending beyond a mere smattering of the schools of the soldier , company , and ba4aalion , and a little guard duty wretchedly performed . By becoming accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the experience of many is likely to unfit them for a time as soldiers when fighting is imminent and the time for nonsense is over . But , fortunately , such conditions may be said to be the exception and not the rule . Within the limited range of their military functions , the officers usually are noted for a zealous performance of duty under conditions not always favorable . The ranks contain multitudes of young men who are enthusiastic soldiers , and zealous students of military science , as far as their opportunities go , and with talents and abilities that would , were they to obtain commissions , convert them very quickly into efficient officers . In the crack organizations the influential position , social and otherwise , of many of the men in the ranks // makes it certain that they would in time of war at once obtain commissions . It is , indeed , a pity that the desire of these young men to extend their military acquirements is not better rewarded , that the long tenure in office of the officers and noncommissioned officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ever gain that confidence which is only to be acquired by command . To extend the instruction of the future officers of volunteers who may be now serving in the National Guard , the general government should use every effort . Only the most active and competent officers of the regular army should be detailed for duty with the militia . Combined encampments of regulars and militia , like those at Aldershot ill England , should be fostered ; theoretical instruction for officers and men , by lectures delivered by our best military talent , should be furnished . It has been wisely suggested that tuition at our schools of application might well be afforded to a limited number of officers of the National Guard . It might be further recommended that , for such members of the National Guard as wish to fit themselves as officers of volunteers , and are unable to leave their homes , the United States may inaugurate a course of tuition by correspondence , similar to the Chautauqua system . Further , to promote military study by ambitious members of the National Guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general government to detail boards of examination , composed of officers of the regular army , empowered to issue certificates of fitness , as officers of volunteers , to such noncommissioned officers or men of the National Guard as can pass an examination akin to the prescribed practical and theoretical examination for promotion to the grade of first lieutenant of the army . The troops of militia cavalry , composed of men of assured position , recently organized in many of our large cities , should have as their principal function the development and schooling of officers . To sum up So long as war is a possibility , we must be convinced that the most important function of the National Guard is to develop officers of volunteers for that war , and every effort should be made by the United States to improve the National Guard as a school of instruction . The officers of the regiments of volunteers raised during the war of 1861-5 , received their commissions from the governors of // the States in which the volunteers were raised . This practice was confirmed by orders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power would probably be tenaciously held on to by the States in any future war . By War Department orders such officers were required to undergo certain prescribed examinations , and in case of failure their commissions were vacated . Such should be the rule in future . Promotions by seniority in the company and regiment were the rule . The system of promotion now in vogue in the regular army is hardly applicable to the volunteers . Companies are raised usually in one township or county . The men know each other and are acquainted with their officers , either personally or by reputation . They have enlisted together , and they expect to stand or fall together . The same is true in a less degree of regiments . To appoint outsiders to vacancies in companies or regiments is found to be demoralizing . In making original appointments of company officers it was the practice of governors , in many States to defer to a certain extent to the views and wishes of the men . Where officers of experience were available the men almost invariably selected them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfortunately , more usual ) such officers were not to be had , this method of selection was perhaps as safe as any other , and had , besides , the advantage in the sight of many of being considered in harmony with the spirit of our laws and institutions . As a popular measure it was undoubtedly efficacious in drawing volunteers more quickly into the ranks . Nevertheless , it is to be hoped that we will not in future be obliged to recur to a measure so opposed to the prompt application of military discipline . The necessity for such methods would disappear were we to turn our attention systematically to t*raining officers in the manner I have suggested . In such case there would be , in addition to the large body of officers of the National Guard , a military reserve of officers registered at the War Department , known in their communities , who by reason of their proved military knowledge would command the attention of all as competent leaders . Men will surrender even their elective principle for the assurance that they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the elective principle to govern in the filling of vacancies occurring after the regiment is once organized , . as is done in the militia of the States , should be condemned as // fatal to proper discipline . Such places should be filled pursuant to the recommendation of the superior officers . The mobilization of our volunteer armies consists mainly in organizing the staff of the various brigades , divisions and corps ; detailing for this purpose the necessary chiefs and personnel of the quartermaster , subsistence , medical , ordnance , engineer , signal and other staff departments ; in accumulating and distributing provisions , clothing , camp equipage , transportation , equipments , arms and ammunition ; in organizing the wagon , pontoon , signal and ammunition trains , and in providing for the necessary movements of troops and supplies to the front . It is well known that in April , 1861 , the general government was unable to supply , without the delay required for their manufacture , either arms , ammunition , clothing or camp equipage , sufficient for the small army of 75,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , in great part compelled to equip their own troops , and many were even obliged to purchase arms and manufacture ammunition . Our supply departments were small and not organized in a suitable manner to meet the emergency ; their officers were often timid about casting loose from the restrictions as to purchase , etc. , which had grown up in time of peace , and the procurement of supplies , even where available , was hedged about with great obstacles and difficulties . We may congratulate ourselves that there is a great improvement over the conditions that prevailed in 1861 . That war is yet fresh in our minds , and the lessons taught by it will be of service for many years in any like emergency . Our staff departments are now organized on a scale more befitting mobilization ; and their officers may be expected to renew the splendid record made later in that war , when it might be said that we had the best equipped and most efficiently supplied armies ever known in history . Thanks , too , to the patriotic policy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to our enormous resources in raw materials , supplies will be immensely more abundant ; provisions will not be wanting ; medical material will be plentiful ; blankets and shoes can be delivered at once or in a few days ; unifo*rms , belts and knapsacks may be manufactured quickly ; and by improvising wooden shelters in our State camps until tents can be manufactured , the training of our newly-raised troops may be commenced at once , without check or hindranee. // In the matter of arms for our troops we are , we fear , not so fortunate . While it is most essential to the quick training of our volunteers that the moment they are raised the necessary small arms and ammunition should be placed in their hands , it is a grave question as to whether , with our present resources , this can be accomplished , it is true that a provision is made yearly , in the sums voted for the War Department , for the manufacture of a certain number of rifles and carbines to be accumulated as a reserve , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arming of , say , 400,000 or 500,000 men , can not be expected to be reached for years to come . Inferior arms in sufficient number might be obtained , but it is of the greatest importance that our volunteers should not lack confidence in their weapons , and we can secure this end only by equipping them with arms of the latest accepted design . While it is true that a number of our private establishments would be able to turn out rifles of the proper calibre , yet it would take time to arrange their plant for the purpose ; and , furthermore , it should not be forgotten that several of these manufacturing plants are on the seaboard , and thus peculiarly exposed to capture by an enemy strong on the sea . It would , therefore , seem that it is imperatively necessary to our national safety that we should have a reserve stock of half a million rifles and carbines . The same is even more true as concerns the field guns for our batteries . In case of a great war to-morrow we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with muzzle loading cannon of a type abandoned by other civilized nations for over twenty years , and which are so far inferior to modern breech loaders in range and accuracy as to make comparison difficult . And while we can manufacture such guns elsewhere than at the government shops , it would require much time to complete the necessary number . It would be the policy of our enemies to strike quickly , and in case of a war with a strong sea power , with our greatest cities lying on our coast and thus exposed to capture , the last battle of the war might be over before the proper equipment of our regiments and batteries was completed . For a foreign enemy , having no possessions on this Continent , might be satisfied with the crippling of our navy and the levying of an enormous contribution on one of our rich seaboard oities or States ; sailing aWay , he would be beyond reprisal . // There is , therefore , no possible excuse for the failure of our governm&amp;nt , or of any department of our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining , at the first call to arms , a sufficient supply of field arms and small arms for an adequate field army . As regards ammunition , it would seem to be necessary that large quantities should be kept on hand by the government , even at the risk of a slight deterioration ; for the manufacturing plants will be severely taxed to turn out the enormous quantity that will be needed at once for the instruction of our troops ; not to speak of the accumulation needed for the demands of fighting . A welldigested plan of ammunition supply in battle should be prepared in advance , so that ammunition trains , with all proper material and per8onnel , may be organized at once . As regards the Adjutant-General 's Department , it becomes clear , as we study the Civil War , that many of the blunders of that conflict , which cost so many lives , might have been prevented , were our generals provided wi th assistants well instructed in the higher branches of the art of war . It is for this reason that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our schools of application increased , so that we may have plenty of officers fitted for these important duties . It is evident that , in relying for our national defense on the volunteer system ; in rejecting the policy of supporting an adequate standing army ; and in deferring the training of our forces until war is actually declared , we have been running a terrible risk , in accepting which we are condemned by all the teachings of modern history , and only partially excused by our isolated position and our hitherto peaceful policy . It is equally evident that nothing but a catastrophe will change our present system . This being so , it should be the duty of the military department of our government , while loyally abiding by the choice of the people , to lessen this risk and ameliorate these conditions as far as possible , not only by inviting appropriate legislation , but also by using the opportunities we have now in our hands , without the aid of Congressional legislation ; for preparing a body of instructors and a system of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an efficient force.
