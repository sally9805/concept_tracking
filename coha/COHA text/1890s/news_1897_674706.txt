txt There were filed with the Secretary of State to-day the articles of incorporation of the Farm and Dairy Product Company of Jersey City . The company Is to issue capital stock to the amount of $15,000,000 . It is authorized to buy and sell milk , butter , and other farm products and manufactures . The home office of the company will be in Jersey City , and it will be authorized ' to do business in all other places , both in and out of the State . The principal business will be conducted in New York and Brooklyn . The incorporating stockholders are John B. Summeafield and Henry C. Everdell of Brooklyn , Samuel B. Lawrence and Francis B. Lowery of New York , and Burnham C. Stickney of Elizabeth , N. J. The formation of the company is the reault of negotiations which have been under Way for several months looking toward the formation of a Milk Trust . The capital for the company is said to have come largely from abroad , principally from London , and the remainder was subscribed in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of supplying milk to New York and Brooklyn and near-by places . Arrangements have been completed whereby farmers who have been supplying isolated creameries will ship direct to the trust . Some of the creameries in the State and the milkproducing belt in New York State will be turned into depots for the trust . The milk of small farms will he delivered to these depots and forwarded . In other places , where the producers are in business on a sufficiently large scale the milk will be shipped direct from the farm to the depots in Jersey City and Hoboken , and thence distributed to the customers in New York . It is claimed for the trust that there is no intention of increasing the price of milk to the consumer , and , on the other hand , there is likely to be a reduction in the price , while the milk will be better than the average now served in New York , and at the same time the trust can pay more to the farmers than the isolated creameries now pay . This result will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons delivering milk in New York City proper . These 4,000 wagons require that number of drivers , and on some of them the driver has a helper . The routes of these sellers of milk cross and recross , and it is not uncommon for a score of milkmen to serve milk on a single block . The trust ' figures that it can give a better service than is now furnished by these independent milkmen with less than 1,000 wagons . The city can be laid . out into routes and properly covered by a thousand wagons where the four thousand are now required . There will be in the city , it is now planned , a series of central stations to which the milk will be brought direct from the receiving stations located at the termini of the milk-carrying railroads . From these central stations in the city , - which will always be . open , the ? wagons are to radiate through the city . Milk , under the existing conditions ; is now sold in New York at from aato S cents a quart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average price for milk delivered . It is estimated that this average can be cut exactly in half , and that milk can be retailed in any part of the city for 3 or 4 cents . The saving from tha reduction of the number of servers will allow this and leave a margin of profit far greater than can now be hoped for by those in the business . There will be enough profit to enable the Trust to handle the milk from the cow to the consumer under the latest hygienic principles . It will permit the Trust to keep a careful watch upon every farm . from which it will draw a portion of its supply , and it will enable it to pay the farmer more for his product , and when he is paid more the Trust thinks it can insist that the quality of the product shall be better . One thing the trust proposes to look after is tile instruction of the farmer . The idea is to make him a part of the business . The promoters claim that at present the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock on the least money and produce sufficient milk to give him a profit . As to the quality of the milk , the farmer cares not so long as it passes the Milk Inspectors . The trust 's idea is that the farmer shall learn that proper feeding will produce milk which will not only stand no chance of being condemned , but which will bring him a better price and better returns in other ways . The practice of grocers and others selling milk , it is understood , will not be encouraged . Sub-stations where dairy products may be purchased will be established , and in them the goods handled will be looked after with the same scientific care as at the main stations . It is claimed that the practice of allowing grocers to sell milk is a dangerous one , as the milk Is not properly looked after , and is liable to contamination through impure iceboxes and improper handling , no matter how pure and good it may be on leaving the hands of the producer . John D. Gilmer is a wealthy baker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was the promoter of the cracker and biscuit trust . He believes in combination and consolidation , and has been contemplating the formation of a milk trust for several years past . He lives in Orange County , and it is said that he is also a milk producer in a small way , besides buying milk from farmers in Orange County and selling it in New York . The people who are backing Mr. Gilmor in this venture of a milk trust are said to be principally Englishmen , who have put up $10,000,000 to bolster up the trust . Mr. Gilmer was enabled to secure their aid more easily , it is said , because the retail milk trade In London is united under one corporation . An agent was sent from England to secure , through Mr. Gilmor , the consent of dairymen in the States of New York and New Jersey for the purchase of their plants . Mr. Gilmor went to work , and is said to have been astonished at the success which he had with the dairymen and owners of creameries within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust is to have a large central receiving and distributing depot in New York with a branch depot in Brooklyn . Wholesale dealers are to be invited to sell out to the trust and join it . An appraisement of the business of each is to be made , and the dealer is to be paid a certain ' proportion in cash , and to take the remainder in stock in the trust . But he is to sign a contract that he will not start a new milk business in the city or within a radius of at least twenty miles for the next twenty years . After capturing the wholesale dealers the trust is to take the retailers- in hand , and then all the wagons are to be removed from the numerous milk routes , and In their places the trust is to have its own wagons with uniformed drivers , who will deliver the milk to the consumers . They are said to be 4,000 milk wagons in New York alone , and it very often happens that from twoto four or five wagons deliver milk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons the trust proposes to have only 1.000 wagons with one route only for each wagon . In this manner the trust will save an im ' mense amount of money by the closing of several hundred milk stores and the laying up of 2,000 wagons . This great economy , Mr. Gilmor argues , will enable the trust to sell better milk for less than it is being sold now , and at the same time to pay the farmers better prices . The feed supplied to the cows will be closely watched . and everything possible will be done according to the expressed plans of the members of the trust to secure a healthy and nutritious product . The negotiations with the wholesale dealers in New York have been difficult . A few of them were quite willing , but several of the largest firms . among them the New York Condensed Milk Company , it is said , would not listen to any arguments and dared the trust to do its worst . The arguments that were gene/ ally brought to bear , it is said , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the creameries that Ailey controlled in the country taken away from them , and their trade in the city taken from under their noses . It was said yesterday that several dealers who bring their milk from Orange County were among those who were very anxious to enter the trust , and had , in fact , been talking about making Orange County the sole source of milk supply for New York . The dealers who turned a deaf ear to the pro . meters of the trust hold that it is impossible for a milk trust to succeed on account of the very perishable nature of the product , for it can not be stored up like coal and sugar and nails and crackers , nor can the supply be restricted . W. A. Blanck , who supplies the largest hotels in this city with milk , remarked yesterday that some milk is brought to New York from a distance of 400 miles . further titan the whole length of England , and to corner all that quantity was an utter impossibility . The price of milk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap as it can possibly be . In some places on the east side it is sold as low as 4 cents a quart , and the Inspectors of the Health Department are unable to detect any adulteration in it . In many houses it is delivered at 5 cents a quart , of very fair quality , and 6 cents is considered a very good price , except for that which is served to , wealthy residents and to the fashionable hotels , who require the best that can be got In the country . The farmers get 3 cents per quart in the Winter months and ? 21 , a cents in Summer , and in this they find a profit . How the trust will be able to pay the farmers higher prices and sell cheaper than is done at present , and how the trust will be able to watch the feed supplied to the cows , Mr. Blanch could not see .
