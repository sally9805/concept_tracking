txt Naval officials feel that another change may have to be made in the make-up of the Eastern Squadron which is to strike a blow against the Spanish coast , as the battleship Iowa suffered some hard knocks during the recent battle with Cervera 's squadron , and it may be necessary to substitute one of the other battleships pending repairs on the Iowa . No decision on the change had been reached thus far , as the department has not received the report showing the exact condition of our ships after the battle . According to Capt . Evans 's story of the battle , the Iowa was struck twice by Spanish shells , and one shell exploded , while the other is imbedded , unexploded , near the water line of the ship . This last shot may prove troublesome , as an unexploded shell near the water ' line is not a desirable adjunct to a battleship . From the light manner in which Capt . Evans speaks of the damage , it is not regarded as very serious by the officials here , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern Squadron to the coast of Spain . Either the Massachusetts or the Indiana will be substituted for the Iowa , if it be found necessary to make a change . Either of them is as formidable as the Iowa . Their four large guns are of the thirteen-inch type , while those of the Iowa . are twelve-inch . In other respects their batteries are similar to the Iowa 's . They are commonly regarded as rather better seagoing ships than the Iowa . The department has not decided to increase the number of Watson 's ships , as has been reported , as : t is felt that the list announced yesterday is quite ample to take care of Admiral Camara 's squadron . Camara 's only armored ships are the Pelayo and Carlos V. , the former of 9,900 , the latter of 9,090 tons . They are outranked in every point by the ships of the American squadron .
