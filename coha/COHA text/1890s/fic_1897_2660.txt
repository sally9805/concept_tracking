In the good old county of Norfolk , close to the shore of Lake Erie , lies the pretty village of Briarsfield . A village I call it , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dignity of a town . Here , on the brow of the hill to the north of the village ( rather a retired spot , one would say , for so busy a man ) , at the time of which my story treats , stood the residence of Dr. Woodburn . It was a long , old-fashioned rough-cast house facing the east , with great wide windows on each side of the door and a veranda all the way across the front . The big lawn was quite uneven , and broken here and there by birch trees , spruces , and crazy clumps of rose-bushes , all in bloom . Altogether it was a sweet , home-like old place . The view to the south showed , over the village roofs on the hill-side , the blue of Lake Erie outlined against the sky , while to the north stretched the open , undulating country , so often seen in Western Ontario . One warm June afternoon Beth , the doctor 's only daughter , was lounging in an attitude more careless than graceful under a birch tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeper -- familiarly known as Aunt Prudence -- formed the whole household . Beth was a little above the average height , a girlish figure , with a trifle of that awkwardness one sometimes meets in an immature girl of eighteen ; a face , not what most people would call pretty , but still having a fair share of beauty . Her features were , perhaps , a little too strongly outlined , but the brow was fair as a lily , and from it the great mass of dark hair was drawn back in a pleasing way . But her eyes -- those earnest , grey eyes -- were the most impressive of all in her unusually impressive face . They were such searching eyes , as though she had stood on the brink scanning the very Infinite , and yet with a certain baffled look in them as of one who had gazed far out , but failed to pierce the gloom -- a beaten , longing look . But a careless observer might have dwelt longer on the affectionate expression about her lips -- a half-childish , half-womanly tenderness . Beth was in one of her dreamy moods that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her favorite view . She sometimes said it was prettier than the lake view . The hill on which their house stood sloped abruptly down , and a meadow , pink with clover , stretched far away to rise again in a smaller hill skirted with a bluish line of pines . There was a single cottage on the opposite side of the meadow , with white blinds and a row of sun-flowers along the wall ; but Beth was not absorbed in the view , and gave no heed to the book beside her . She was dreaming . She had just been reading the life of George Eliot , her favorite author , and the book lay open at her picture . She had begun to love George Eliot like a personal friend ; she was her ideal , her model , for Beth had some repute as a literary character in Briarsfield . Not a teacher in the village school but had marked her strong literary powers , and she was not at all slow to believe all the hopeful compliments paid her . From a child her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she was eighteen she told herself she was ready to reach out into the great literary world -- a nestling longing to soar . Yes , she would be famous -- Beth Woodburn , of Briarsfield . She was sure of it . She would write novels ; oh , such grand novels ! She would drink from the very depths of nature and human life . The stars , the daisies , sunsets , rippling waters , love and sorrow , and all the infinite chords that vibrate in the human soul -- she would weave them all with warp of gold . Oh , the world would see what was in her soul ! She would be the bright particular star of Canadian literature ; and then wealth would flow in , too , and she would fix up the old home . Dear old " daddy " should retire and have everything he wanted : and Aunt Prudence , on sweeping days , would n't mind moving " the trash , " as she called her manuscripts . Daddy would n't make her go to bed at ten o'clock then ; she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little room on purpose , and visitors at Briarsfield would pass by the old rough-cast house and point it out as Beth Woodburn 's home , and -- well , this is enough for a sample of Beth 's daydreams . They were very exaggerated , perhaps , and a little selfish , too ; but she was not a fully-developed woman yet , and the years were to bring sweeter fruit . She had , undoubtedly , the soul of genius , but genius takes years to unfold itself . Then a soft expression crossed the face of the dreamer . She leaned back , her eyes closed and a light smile played about her lips . She was thinking of one who had encouraged her so earnestly -- a tall , slender youth , with light curly hair , blue eyes and a fair , almost girlish , face -- too fair and delicate for the ideal of most girls : but Beth admired its paleness and delicate features , and Clarence Mayfair had come to be often in her thoughts . She remembered quite well when the Mayfairs had moved into the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , and she had become friends with the only daughter , Edith , at school , and then with Clarence . Clarence wrote such pretty little poems , too . This had been the foundation of their friendship , and , since their tastes and ambitions were so much alike , what if --  Her eyes grew brighter , and she almost fancied he was looking down into her face . Oh , those eyes -- hush , maiden heart , be still . She smiled at the white cloud drifting westward -- a little boat-shaped cloud , with two white figures in it , sailing in the summer blue . The breeze ruffled her dark hair . There fell a long shadow on the grass beside her . " Clarence -- Mr . Mayfair ! I did n't see you coming . When did you get home ? " " Last night . I stayed in Toronto till the report of our ' exams ' came out . " " I see you have been successful , " she replied . " Allow me to congratulate you . " " Thank you . I hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you think it quite an undertaking ? I 'm sure I wish you joy of the hard work . " " Why , I hope you are not wearying of your course in the middle of it , Mr. Mayfair . It is only two years till you will have your B.A. " " Two years ' hard work , though ; and , to tell the truth , a B.A. has lost its charms for me . I long to devote my life more fully to literature . That is my first ambition , you know , and I seem to be wasting so much time . " " You can hardly call time spent that way wasted , " she answered . " You will write all the better for it by and by . " Then they plunged into one of their old-time literary talks of authors and books and ambitions . Beth loved these talks . There was no one else in Briarsfield she could discuss these matters with like Clarence . She was noticing meanwhile how much paler he looked than when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . There are some women who love a man all the more for being delicate . It gives them better opportunities to display their womanly tenderness . Beth was one of these . " By the way , I must n't forget my errand , " Clarence exclaimed after a long chat . He handed her a dainty little note , an invitation to tea from his sister Edith . Beth accepted with pleasure . She blushed as he pressed her hand in farewell , and their eyes met . That look and touch of his went very deep -- deeper than they should have gone , perhaps ; but the years will tell their tale . She watched him going down the hill-side in the afternoon sunshine , then fell to dreaming again . What if , after all , she should not always stay alone with daddy ? If someone else should come -- And she began to picture another study where she should not have to write alone , but there should be two desks by the broad windows looking out on the lake , and somebody should --  " Beth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full with them cherries . " Beth 's dream was a little rudely broken by Mrs. Martin 's voice , but she complacently rose and went into the house . Mrs. Martin was a small grey-haired woman , very old-fashioned ; a prim , good old soul , a little sharp-tongued , a relic of bygone days of Canadian life . She had been Dr. Woodburn 's housekeeper ever since Beth could remember , and they had always called her " Aunt Prudence . " " What did that gander-shanks of a Mayfair want ? " asked the old lady with a funny smile , as Beth was bustling about . " Oh , just come to bring an invitation to tea from Edith . " Dr. Woodburn entered as soon as tea was ready . He was the ideal father one meets in books , and if there was one thing on earth Beth was proud of it was " dear daddy . " He was a fine , broad-browed man , strikingly like Beth , but with hair silvery long before its time . His eyes were like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shadow of gloom that did not belong to the doctor 's genial countenance . It was a pleasant little tea-table to which they sat down . Mrs Martin always took tea with them , and as she talked over Briarsfield gossip to the doctor , Beth , as was her custom , looked silently out of the window upon the green sloping lawn . " Well , Beth , dear , " said Dr. Woodburn , " has Mrs. Martin told you that young Arthur Grafton is coming to spend his holidays with us ? " " Arthur Grafton ! Why , no ! " said Beth with pleased surprise . " He is coming . He may drop in any day . He graduated this spring , you know . He 's a fine young man , I 'm told . " " Oh ! Beth ai n't got time to think about anything but that slim young Mayfair , now-a-days , " put in Mrs. Martin . " He 's been out there with her most of the afternoon , and me with all them cherries to tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's face , but put it aside as fancy only and began to think of Arthur . He was an old play-fellow of hers . An orphan at an early age , he had spent his childhood on his uncle 's farm , just beyond the pine wood to the north of her home . Her father had always taken a deep interest in him , and when the death of his uncle and aunt left him alone in the world , Dr. Woodburn had taken him into his home for a couple of years until he had gone away to school . Arthur had written once or twice , but Beth was staying with her Aunt Margaret , near Welland , that summer , and she had seen fit , for unexplained reasons , to stop the correspondence : so the friendship had ended there . It was five years now since she had seen her old play-fellow , and she found herself wondering if he would be greatly changed . After tea Beth took out her books , as usual , for an hour or two ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , started up the road for the milk . This was one of her childhood 's tasks that she still took pleasure in performing . She sauntered along in the sweet June twilight past the fragrant clover meadow and through the pine wood , with the fire-flies darting beneath the boughs . Some girls would have been frightened , but Beth was not timid . She loved the still sweet solitude of her evening walk . The old picket gate clicked behind her at the Birch Farm , and she went up the path with its borders of four-o'clocks . It was Arthur 's old home , where he had passed his childhood at his uncle's -- a great cheery old farm-house , with morning-glory vines clinging to the windows , and sun-flowers thrusting their great yellow faces over the kitchen wall . The door was open , but the kitchen empty , and she surmised that Mrs. Birch had not finished milking ; so Beth sat down on the rough bench beneath the crab-apple tree and began to dream of the olden days . There was the old chain swing where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he filled her apron . She was seven and he was ten -- but such a man in her eyes , that sun-browned , dark-eyed boy . And what a hero he was to her when she fell over the bridge , and he rescued her ! He used to get angry though sometimes . Dear , how he thrashed Sammie Jones for calling her a " little snip . " Arthur was good , though , very good . He used to sit in that very bench where she was sitting , and explain the Sunday-school lesson to her , and say such good things . Her father had told her two or three years ago of Arthur 's decision to be a missionary . He was going away off to Palestine . " I wonder how he can do it , " she thought . " He has his B.A. now , too , and he was always so clever . He must be a hero . I 'm not good like that ; I -- I do n't think I want to be so good . Clarence is n't as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows it . I wonder if Arthur will like Clarence ? " Mrs. Birch , with a pail of fresh milk on each arm , interrupted her reverie . Beth enjoyed her walk home that night . The moon had just risen , and the pale stars peeped through the patches of white cloud that to her fancy looked like the foot-prints of angels here and there on the path of the infinite . As she neared home a sound of music thrilled her . It was only an old familiar tune , but she stopped as if in a trance . The touch seemed to fill her very soul . It was so brave and yet so tender . The music ceased ; some sheep were bleating in the distance , the stars were growing brighter , and she went on toward home . She was surprised as she crossed the yard to see a tall dark-haired stranger talking to her father in the parlor . She was just passing the parlor door when he came toward her . " Well , Beth , my old play-mate ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist as they stood with clasped hands , the handsome dark-eyed man , the girl , in her white dress , her milk-pail on her arm , and her wondering grey eyes upturned to his . " Why , Beth , you look at me as if I were a spectre . " " But , Arthur , you 're so changed ! Why , you 're a man , now ! " at which he laughed a merry laugh that echoed clear to the kitchen . Beth joined her father and Arthur in the parlor , and they talked the old days over again before they retired to rest . Beth took out her pale blue dress again before she went to sleep . Yes , she would wear that to the Mayfair 's next day , and there were white moss roses at the dining-room window that would just match . So thinking she laid it carefully away and slept her girl 's sleep that night . CHAPTER II . A DREAM OF LIFE . It was late the next afternoon when Beth stood before the mirror fastening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with her father to see a friend , and would not return till well on in the evening . Aunt Prudence gave her the customary warning about not staying late and Beth went off with a lighter heart than usual . It was a delightful day . The homes all looked so cheery , and the children were playing at the gates as she went down the street . There was one her eye dwelt on more than the rest . The pigeons were strutting on the sloping roof , the cat dozed in the window-sill , and the little fair-haired girls were swinging under the cherry-tree . Yes , marriage and home must be sweet after all . Beth had always said she never would marry . She wanted to write stories and not have other cares . But school girls change their views sometimes . It was only a few minutes ' walk to the Mayfair residence beside the lake . Beth was familiar with the place and scarcely noticed the great old lawn , the trees almost concealing the house : that pretty fountain yonder , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie stretching far away . Edith Mayfair came down the walk to meet her , a light-haired , winsome creature , several years older than Beth . But she looked even younger . Hers was such a child-like face ! It was pretty to see the way she twined her arm about Beth . They had loved each other ever since the Mayfairs had come to Briarsfield three years ago . Mr. and Mrs. Mayfair were sitting on the veranda . Beth had always loved Mrs. Mayfair ; she was such a bright girlish woman , in spite of her dignity and soft grey hair . Mr. Mayfair , too , had a calm , pleasing manner . To Beth 's literary mind there was something about the Mayfair home that reminded her of a novel . They were wealthy people , at least supposed to be so , who had settled in Briarsfield to live their lives in rural contentment . It was a pretty room of Edith 's that she took Beth into -- a pleasing confusion of curtains , books , music , and flowers , with a guitar lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little table that caught Beth 's attention . It was Mr. Ashley , the classical master in Briarsfield High School , for Briarsfield could boast a High School . He and Edith had become very friendly , and village gossip was already linking their names . Beth looked up and saw Edith watching her with a smiling , blushing face . The next minute she threw both arms about Beth . " Ca n't you guess what I was going to tell you , Beth , dear ? " " Why , Edith , are you and Mr. Ashley --  " " Yes , dear . I thought you would guess . " Beth only hugged her by way of congratulation , and Edith laughed a little hysterically . Beth was used to these emotional fits of Edith 's . Then she began to question --  " When is it to be ? " " September . And you will be my bridesmaid , wo n't you , dear ? " Beth promised . " Oh , Beth , I think marriage is the grandest institution God ever made . " Beth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea-bell broke their reverie . Mr. Ashley had dropped in for tea , and Clarence sat beside Beth , with Edith and her betrothed opposite . It was so pleasant and home-like , with the pink cluster of roses smiling in at the window . After tea , Edith and Mr. Ashley seemed prepared for a tete-a-tete , in which Mrs. Mayfair was also interested ; and Clarence took Beth around to the conservatory to see a night-blooming cirius . It was not out yet , and so they went for a promenade through the long grounds toward the lake . Beth never forgot that walk in all her life to come . Somehow she did not seem herself . All her ambition and struggle seemed at rest . She was a child , a careless child , and the flowers bloomed around her , and Clarence was at her side . The lake was very calm when they reached it ; the stars were shining faintly , and they could see Long Point Island like a long dark line in the distant water . " Arthur is going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth . They had just reached a little cliff jutting out over the water . It was , perhaps , one of the most picturesque scenes on the shores of Lake Erie . " Would n't it be grand to be on this cliff and watch a thunderstorm coming up over the lake ? " said Beth . " You are very daring Beth -- Miss Woodburn . Edith would rather hide her head under the blankets . " " Do you know , I really love thunderstorms , " continued Beth . " It is such a nice safe feeling to lie quiet and sheltered in bed and hear the thunder crash and the storm beat outside . Somehow , I always feel more deeply that God is great and powerful , and that the world has a live ruler . " She stopped rather suddenly . Clarence never touched on religious subjects in conversation --  " Dear , what a ducking Arthur and I got in a thunderstorm one time . We were out hazel-nutting and --  " " Do you always call Mr. Grafton Arthur ? " interrupted Clarence , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny it would seem to call Arthur Mr. Grafton ! " " Beth "  - -  he grew paler and his voice almost trembled ,  --  " Beth , do you love Arthur Grafton ? " " Love Arthur ! Why , dear , no ! I never thought of it . He 's just like my brother . Besides , " she continued after a pause , " Arthur is going away off somewhere to be a missionary , and I do n't think I could be happy if I married a man who was n't a writer . " That was very naive of Beth . She forgot Clarence 's literary pretensions . " Then can you love me , Beth ? Do n't you see that I love you ? " There was a moment 's silence . Their eyes met in a long , earnest look . An impulse of tenderness came over her , and she threw both arms about his neck as he clasped her to his breast . The stars were shining above and the water breaking at their feet . They understood each other without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , so very happy ! " The night air wafted the fragrance of roses about them like incense . They walked on along the shore , happy lovers , weaving their life-dreams under the soft sky of that summer night . " I wonder if anyone else is as happy as we are , Beth ! " " Oh , Clarence , how good we ought to be ! I mean to always be kinder and to try and make other people happy , too . " " You are good , Beth . May God bless our lives . " She had never seen Clarence so earnest and manly before . Yes , she was very much in love , she told herself . They talked much on the way back to the house . He told her that his father was not so wealthy as many people supposed ; that it would be several years before he himself could marry . But Beth 's brow was not clouded . She wanted her college course , and somehow Clarence seemed so much more manly with a few difficulties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached the house . Edith was playing her guitar . Mrs. Mayfair met them on the veranda . " Why , Clarence , how late you 've kept the child out , " said Mrs. Mayfair with a motherly air . " I 'm afraid you will catch cold , Miss Woodburn ; there is such a heavy dew ! " Clarence went up to his mother and said something in a low tone . A pleased look lighted her face . " I am so glad , dear Beth , my daughter . I shall have another daughter in place of the one I am giving away . " She drew the girl to her breast with tender affection . Beth had been motherless all her life , and the caress was sweet and soothing to her . Edith fastened her cape and kissed her fondly when she was going home . Clarence went with her , and somehow everything was so dream-like and unreal that even the old rough-cast home looked strange and shadowy in the moon-light . It was perhaps a relief that her father had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even her own little room seemed strangely unnatural that night . She stopped just inside the door and looked at it , the moonlight streaming through the open window upon her bed . Was she really the same Beth Woodburn that had rested there last night and thought about the roses . She took them out of her belt now . A sweetly solemn feeling stole over her , and she crossed over and knelt at the window , the withered roses in her hand , her face upturned to heaven . Sacred thoughts filled her mind . She had longed for love , someone to love , someone who loved her ; but was she worthy , she asked herself , pure enough , good enough ? She felt to-night that she was kneeling at an unseen shrine , a bride , to be decked by the holy angels in robes whiter than mortal ever saw . Waves of sweet music aroused her . She started up as from a dream , recognizing at once the touch of the same hand that she had heard in the distance the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , right beneath hers ! She held her breath almost as she stole out and leaned over the balustrade to peer into the parlor . Why , it was Arthur ! Was it possible he could play like that ? She made a striking picture as she stood there on the stairs , her great grey eyes drinking in the music : but she was relieved somehow when it ceased . It was bright , quick , inspiring ; but it seemed to make her forget her new-born joy while it lasted . CHAPTER III . WHITHER , BETH ? Beth was lying in the hammock , watching the white clouds chase each other over the sky . Her face was quite unclouded , though the morning had not passed just as she had hoped . It was the next afternoon after she had taken tea at the Mayfair 's , and Clarence had come to see her father that morning . They had had a long talk in the study , and Beth had sat in her room anxiously pulling to pieces the roses that grew at her window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence was gone , and she thought her father did not look quite satisfied , though he smiled as she sat down beside him . " Beth , I am sorry you are engaged so young , " he said gently . " Are you sure you love him , Beth ? " " Oh , yes , papa , dear . You do n't understand , " and she put both arms about his neck . " I am in love , truly . Believe me , I shall be happy . " " Clarence is delicate , too , " said her father with a grave look . They were both silent for a few minutes . " But , after all , he can not marry for three or four years to come , and you must take your college course , Beth . " They were silent again for a moment . " Well , God bless you , Beth , my darling child . " There were tears in his eyes , and his voice was very gentle . He kissed her and went out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Only Beth wished he had looked more hopeful and enthusiastic over the change in her life . Aunt Prudence had been told before dinner , and she had taken it in a provokingly quiet fashion that perplexed Beth . What was the matter with them all ? Did they think Clarence the pale-faced boy that he looked ? They were quite mistaken . Clarence was a man . So Miss Beth reasoned , and the cloud passed off her brow , for , after all , matters were about as they were before . The morning had been rather pleasant , too . Arthur had played some of his sweet old pieces , and then asked as a return favor to see some of her writing . She had given him several copies of the Briarsfield Echo , and he was still reading . In spite of her thoughts of Clarence , she wondered now and again what Arthur would think of her . Would he be proud of his old play-mate ? He came across the lawn at last and drew one of the chairs up beside the hammock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suppose I should be proud of you . You are talented -- indeed , you are more than talented : you are a genius , I believe . But do you know , Beth , I do not like your writings ? " He looked at her as if it pained him to utter these words . " They are too gloomy . There is a sentimental gloom about everything you write . I do n't know what the years since we parted have brought you , Beth , but your writings do n't seem to come from a full heart , overflowing with happiness . It seems to me that with your command of language and flowing style you might bring before your reader such sweet little homes and bright faces and sunny hearts , and that is the sweetest mission a writer has , I believe . " Beth watched him silently . She had not expected this from Arthur . She thought he would overwhelm her with praise ; and , instead , he sat there like a judge laying all her faults before her . Stern critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur . " I do n't like him any more , " she thought . " He is n't like his old self . " But somehow she could not help respecting him as she looked at him sitting there with that great wave of dark hair brushed back from his brow , and his soulful eyes fixed on something in space . He looked a little sad , too . " Still , he is n't a writer like Clarence , " she thought , " and he does n't know how to praise like Clarence does . " " But Arthur , " she said , finally speaking her thoughts aloud ; " you speak as though I could change my way of writing merely by resolving to . I can write only as nature allows . " " That 's too sentimental , Beth ; just like your writing . You are a little bit visionary . " " But there are gloomy and visionary writers as well as cheerful ones . Both have their place . " " I do not believe , Beth , that gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadness and sorrow will come , but there is sweetness in the cup as well . The clouds drift by with the hours , Beth , but the blue sky stands firm throughout all time . " She caught sight of Clarence coming as he was speaking , and scarcely heeded his last words , but nevertheless they fastened themselves in her mind , and in after years she recalled them . Clarence and Arthur had never met before face to face , and somehow there was something striking about the two as they did so . Arthur was only a few years older , but he looked so manly and mature beside Clarence . They smiled kindly when Beth introduced them , and she felt sure that they approved of each other . Arthur withdrew soon , and Beth wondered if he had any suspicion of the truth . Once alone with her , Clarence drew her to his heart in true lover-like fashion . " Oh , Clarence , do n't ! People will see you . " " Suppose they do . You are mine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't , will you ? " He yielded to her in a pleasant teasing fashion . " Have you had a talk with your father , Beth ? " " Yes , " she answered seriously , " and I rather hoped he would take it differently . " " I had hoped so , too ; but , still , he does n't oppose us , and he will become more reconciled after a while , you know , when he sees what it is to have a son . Of course , he thinks us very young ; but still I think we are more mature than many young people of our age . " Beth 's face looked changed in the last twenty-four hours . She had a more satisfied , womanly look . Perhaps that love-craving heart of hers had been too empty . " I have been looking at the upstair rooms at home , " said Clarence . " There will have to be some alterations before our marriage . " " Why , Clarence ! " she exclaimed , laughing ; " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be married next week . " " Sure enough , the time is a long way off , but it 's well to be looking ahead . There are two nice sunny rooms on the south side . One of them would be so nice for study and writing . It has a window looking south toward the lake , and another west . You were always fond of watching the sun set , Beth . But you must come and look at them . Let 's see , to-day 's Saturday . Come early next week ; I shall be away over Sunday , you know . " " Yes , you told me so last night . " " Did I tell you of our expected guest ? " he asked , after a pause . " Miss Marie de Vere , the daughter of an old friend of my mother 's . Her father was a Frenchman , an aristocrat , quite wealthy , and Marie is the only child , an orphan . My mother has asked her here for a few weeks . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marie de Vere , pretty , too . I wonder what she will be like . " " I hope you will like her , Beth . She makes her home in Toronto , and it would be nice if you became friends . You will be a stranger in Toronto , you know , next winter . How nice it will be to have you there while I am there , Beth . I can see you quite often then . Only I hate to have you study so hard . " " Oh , but then it wo n't hurt my brain , you know . Thoughts of you will interrupt my studies so often " she said , with a coquettish smile . Clarence told her some amusing anecdotes of ' Varsity life , then went away early , as he was going to leave the village for a day or two . Beth hurried off to the kitchen to help Aunt Prudence . It was unusual for her to give any attention to housework , but a new interest in domestic affairs seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and somehow it seemed unusually sacred to Beth . The Woodburn household was at church quite early , and Beth sat gazing out of the window at the parsonage across the road . It was so home-like -- a great square old brick , with a group of hollyhocks beside the study window . The services that day seemed unusually sweet , particularly the Sunday-school hour . Beth 's attention wandered from the lesson once or twice , and she noticed Arthur in the opposite corner teaching a class of little girls -- little tots in white dresses . He looked so pleased and self-forgetful . Beth had never seen him look like that before ; and the children were open-eyed . She saw him again at the close of the Sunday-school , a little light-haired creature in his arms . " Why , Arthur , I did n't think you were so fond of children . " " Oh , yes , I 'm quite a grandfather , only minus the grey hair . " It was beautiful walking home that afternoon in the light June breeze . She wondered what Clarence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , as she opened the gate , and she thought how sorry she should be to leave it to go to college in the fall . Beth stayed in her room a little while , and then came down stairs . Arthur was alone in the parlor , sitting by the north window , and Beth sat down near . The wind had ceased , the sun was slowly sinking in the west , a flock of sheep were resting in the shadow of the elms on the distant hill-slope , and the white clouds paused in the blue as if moored by unseen hands . Who has not been moved by the peace and beauty of the closing hours of a summer Sabbath ? Arthur and Beth were slow to begin conversation , for silence seemed more pleasing . " Arthur , when are you going out as a missionary ? " asked Beth , at last . " Not for three or four years yet . " " Where are you going , do you know ? " " To the Jews , at Jerusalem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go ? " " Yes , for I am going to pay my own expenses . A bachelor uncle of mine died , leaving me an annuity . " " Do n't you dread going , though ? " " Dread it ! No , I rejoice in it ! " he said , with a radiant smile . " One has so many opportunities of doing good in a work like that . " " Do you always think of what you can do for others ? " " That is the best way to live , " he answered , a sweet smile in the depths of his dark eyes . " But do n't you dread the loneliness ? " " I will never leave thee nor forsake thee . " " Oh , Arthur ! " she buried her face for a moment in the cushions , and then looked up at him with those searching grey eyes of hers --  " you are brave ; you are good ; I wish I were , too . " He looked down upon her tenderly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life a consecrated one -- one of service ? " " It is all consecrated but one thing , and I ca n't consecrate that . " " You will never be happy till you do . Beth , I am afraid you are not perfectly happy , " he said , after a pause . " You do not look to be . " " Oh , yes , I am quite happy , very happy , and I shall be happier still by and by , " she said , thinking of Clarence . " But , Arthur , there is one thing I ca n't consecrate . I am a Christian , and I do mean to be good , only I ca n't consecrate my literary hopes and work . " " Oh , why not , Beth ? That is the very thing you should consecrate . That 's the widest field you have for work . But why not surrender that , too , Beth ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I could n't write like ' Pansy ' does , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need to write like ' Pansy . ' She has done splendid work , though , and I do n't believe there is a good home where she is n't loved . But it may not be your place to be just like ' Pansy . ' " " No ; I want to be like George Eliot . " A graver look crossed his face . " That is right to a certain extent . George Eliot certainly had a grand intellect , but if she had only been a consecrated Christian woman how infinitely greater she might have been . With such talent as hers undoubtedly was , she could have touched earth with the very tints of heaven . Beth , do n't you see what grand possibilities are yours , with your natural gifts and the education and culture that you will have ? " " Ah , yes . Arthur , but then -- I am drifting somehow . Life is bearing me another way . I feel it within me . By-and-by I hope to be famous , and perhaps wealthy , too , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the part of noble men and women to drift like that , Beth . You will be leaving home this fall , and life is opening up to you . Do you not see there are two paths before you ? Which will you choose , Beth ? ' For self ? ' or ' for Jesus ? ' The one will bring you fame and wealth , perhaps , but though you smile among the adoring crowds you will not be satisfied . The other -- oh , it would make you so much happier ! Your books would be read at every fire-side , and Beth Woodburn would be a name to be loved . You are drifting -- but whither , Beth ? " His voice was so gentle as he spoke , his smile so tender , and there was something about him so unlike any other man , she could not forget those last words . The moon-beams falling on her pillow that night mingled with her dreams , and she and Clarence were alone together in a lovely island garden . It was so very beautiful -- a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a star-gemmed heaven for its dome , a star-strewn sea all round ! No mortal artist could have planned that mysteriously beautiful profusion of flowers -- lily and violet , rose and oleander , palm-tree and passion-vine , and the olive branches and orange blossoms interlacing in the moon-light above them . Arthur was watering the tall white lilies by the water-side and all was still with a hallowed silence they dared not break . Suddenly a wild blast swept where they stood . All was desolate and bare , and Clarence was gone . In a moment the bare rocks where she had stood were overwhelmed , and she was drifting far out to sea -- alone ! Stars in the sky above -- stars in the deep all round and the winds and the waters were still ! And she was drifting -- but whither ? CHAPTER IV . MARIE . " Is n't she pretty ? " " She 's picturesque looking . " " Pretty ? picturesque ? I think she 's ugly ! " These were the varied opinions of a group of Briarsfield girls who were at the station when the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender girl whom the Mayfairs received with warmth . It was Marie de Vere -- graceful , brown-eyed , with a small olive face and daintily dressed brown hair . This was the girl that Beth and Arthur were introduced to when they went to the Mayfairs to tea a few days later . Beth recalled the last evening she was there to tea . Only a few days had since passed , and yet how all was changed ! " Do you like Miss de Vere ? " asked Clarence , after Beth had enjoyed a long conversation with her . " Oh , yes ! I 'm just delighted with her ! She has such kind eyes , and she seems to understand one so well ! " " You have fallen in love at first sight . The pleasure on your face makes up for the long time I have waited to get you alone . Only I wish you would look at me like you looked at Miss de Vere just now , " he said , trying to look dejected . She laughed . Those little affectionate expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a cold and unresponsive husband . He was not a very ardent lover , and grey-eyed , intellectual Beth Woodburn had a love-hungering heart , though few people knew it . " Do you know , " said Beth , " Miss de Vere has told me that there is a vacant room at her boarding-house . She is quite sure she can get it for me this winter . Is n't she kind ? I believe we shall be great friends . " " Yes , you will enjoy her friendship . She is a clever artist and musician , you know . Edith says she lives a sort of Bohemian life in Toronto . Her rooms are littered with music and painting and literature . " " How nice ! Her face looks as if she had a story , too . There 's something sad in her eyes . " " She struck me as being remarkably lively , " said Clarence . " Oh , yes , but there are lively people who have secret sorrows . Look , there she is walking with Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps fate may see fit to link them together , " he said . " Oh , no , I do n't think so ! I ca n't imagine it . " " Grafton 's a fine fellow , is n't he ? " " I 'm glad you like him so well , Clarence . He 's just like my brother , you know . We had such an earnest talk Sunday night . He made me feel , oh , I do n't know how . But do you know , my life is n't consecrated to God , Clarence ; is yours ? " They were walking under the stars of the open night , and Clarence looked thoughtful for a moment , then answered unhesitatingly : " No , Beth . I settled that long ago . I do n't think we need to be consecrated . So long as we are Christians and live fairly consistent lives , I think that suffices . Of course , with people like Arthur Grafton it is different . But as for us we are consecrated to art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us make the utmost of our talents . " " Yes , we are consecrated to art , " said Beth with a sigh of relief , and began talking of Marie . Since Beth was to leave home in the fall , she did not go away during the summer , and consequently saw much of Marie during the few weeks she stayed at Briarsfield . It is strange how every life we come in contact with leaves its impress upon ourselves ! It was certainly so with Marie and Beth . Marie had seen so much of the world and of human life , and Beth had always lived so quietly there in her own village , that now a restlessness took possession of her to get away far beyond the horizon of Briarsfield . The days passed on as days will pass . Clarence was home most of the time , and he and Beth had many walks together in the twilight , and sometimes in the morning . What delightful walks they were in the cool of the early summer morning ! There was one especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road-side . It was a little hill-top , with the ground sloping down on either side , then rising again in great forest-crowned hills . Two oak trees , side by side , shaded them as they watched the little clouds sailing over the harvest fields . Arthur was with them a great deal of the summer , and Beth was occupied with preparations for leaving home . She used to talk to Arthur about Marie sometimes , but he disappointed her by his coldness . She fancied that he did not altogether approve of Marie . CHAPTER V. " FOR I LOVE YOU , BETH . " It came soon , her last Sabbath at home , and the sun was sinking in the west . Beth sat by her favorite window in the parlor . Do you remember that last Sabbath before you left home ? Everything , the hills outside , the pictures on the walls , even the very furniture , looked at you in mute farewell . Beth leaned back in her rocker and looked through the open door into the kitchen with its maple floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the fire had been made for tea . She had always liked that stove with its cheery fire . Then she turned her eyes to the window and noted that the early September frost had browned her favorite meadow where the clover bloomed last June , and that the maples along the road where she went for the milk every evening , were now all decked in crimson and yellow . Her father was sitting at the table reading , but when she looked around she saw his eyes were fixed upon her with a tender look . Poor father ! He would miss her , she knew , though he tried not to let her see how much . Aunt Prudence , too , dear old soul , seemed sorry to have her go , but she had her own peculiar way of expressing it , namely , by getting crosser every day . She did not approve of so much " larnin ' " for girls , especially when Beth was " goin ' to be married to that puny Mayfair . " Aunt Prudence always said her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meant well and Beth understood . Beth was not to go until Friday , and Clarence was to meet her at the station . He had been called away to the city with his father on business more than a week before . Arthur was with them to-day , but he was to leave on the early morning train to join a college mate . He was to be at Victoria University that winter and Beth expected to see him often . They had an early supper , and the September sunset streamed through the open window on the old-fashioned china tea-set . Beth was disappointed after tea when her father 's services were required immediately by a patient several miles away . Arthur and she sat down by that same old parlor window in the hush of the coming night ; a few white clouds were spread like angel wings above and the early stars were shining in the west . They were silent for a while . Arthur and Beth were often silent when together , but the silence was a pleasing , not an embarrassing one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Arthur . " Yes , I am ; and would you believe it , I thought I 'd be so glad to have a change , and yet it makes me sad now the time is drawing near . " They were silent again for a while . " Arthur , do you know , I think it seems so hard for you to go away so far and be a missionary when you are so fond of home and home life . " He smiled tenderly upon her , but she did not know the meaning of that smile then as she knew a little later . " It is my Father 's will , " he said with a sweeter , graver smile . " Beth , do you not see how your talent could be used in the mission field ? " " He does not know I am going to marry Clarence , " she thought with a smile , " and he is going to map out a life work for a maiden lady . " " No , I do n't see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large proportion of the world that never read such a thing as a missionary book , and that if more such books were read , missions would be better supported . Now , if someone with bright talents were to write fascinating stories of Arabian life or life in Palestine , see how much interest would be aroused . But then you would need to live among the people and know their lives , and who would know them so well as a missionary ? " Beth smiled at his earnestness . " Oh , no , Arthur ; I could n't do that . " His eyes filled in a moment with a sad , pleading look . " Beth , can you refuse longer to surrender your life and your life 's toil ? Look , Beth , " he said , pointing upward to the picture of Christ upon the wall , " can you refuse Him -- can you refuse , Beth ? " " Oh , Arthur , do n't , " she said drooping her face . " But I must , Beth ! Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Her eyes were turned away and she answered nothing . " Beth , " he said softly , " I have a more selfish reason for urging you -- for I love you , Beth . I have loved you since we were children together . Will you be my own -- my wife ? It is a holy service I ask you to share . Are you ready , Beth ? " Her pale face was hidden in her hands . He touched her hair reverently . Tick ! tick ! tick ! from the old clock in the silence . Then a crimson flush , and she rose with sudden violence . " Oh , Arthur , what can you mean ? I thought -- you seemed my brother almost -- I thought you would always be that . Oh , Arthur ! Arthur ! how can you -- how dare you talk so ? I am Clarence Mayfair 's promised wife . " " Clarence Mayfair's --  " The words died away on his white lips . He leaned upon the mantel-piece , and Beth stood with her grey eyes fixed . His face was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his brow bore the marks of strong agony . Oh , he was wounded ! Those moments were awful in their silence . The darkness deepened in the old parlor . There was a sound of voices passing in the street . The church bell broke the stillness . Softly the old calm crept over his brow , and he raised his face and looked at her with those great dark eyes -- eyes of unfathomable tenderness and impenetrable fire , and she felt that her very soul stood naked before him . She trembled and sank on the couch at her side . His look was infinitely tender as he came toward her . " I have hurt you -- forgive me , " he said gently , and he laid his hand on her head so reverently for a moment . His white lips murmured something , but she only caught the last words , " God bless you -- forever . Good-bye , Beth -- little Beth . " He smiled back upon her as he left the room , but she would rather he had looked sad . That smile -- she could never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat motionless for a while after he left the room . She felt thrilled and numbed . There are moments in life when souls stand forth from their clayey frames and touch each other , forgetful of time and space . It was one of those experiences that Beth had just passed through . She went to her room and crouched down at her window beneath the stars of that autumn night . Poor Arthur ! She was so sad over it all . And he had loved her ! How strange ! How could it have been ? Loved her since they were children , he had said . She had never thought of love coming like that . And they had played together upon that meadow out there . They had grown up together , and he had even lived in her home those few years before he went to college . No , she had never dreamed of marrying Arthur ! But oh , he was wounded so ! She had never seen him look like that before . And he had hoped that she would share his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured her far away under the burning sun of Palestine , bathing his heated brow and cheering him for fresh effort . He had pictured , perhaps , a little humble home , quiet and peaceful , somewhere amid the snow-crested mountains of the East , where he would walk with her in the cool of night-fall , under the bright stars and clear sky of that distant land . Poor , mistaken Arthur ! She was not fitted for such a life , she thought . They were never made for each other . Their ambitions were not the same . She had found her counterpart in Clarence , and he understood her as Arthur never could have done . Arthur was a grand , good , practical man , but there was nothing of the artist-soul in him , she thought . But she had hoped that he would always be her own and Clarence 's friend . He was such a noble friend ! And now her hope was crushed . She could never be the same to him again , she knew , and he had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , and she lingered over the last two words , " little Beth . " Yes , she would be " little Beth " to him , forever now , the little Beth that he had loved and roamed with over meadow and woodland and wayside , in the sunny , bygone days . " Good-bye , Beth -- little Beth . " Poor Arthur ! CHAPTER VI . ' VARSITY . Friday morning came , the last day of September , and the train whistled sharply as it steamed around the curve from Briarsfield with Beth at one of the car-windows . It had almost choked her to say good-bye to her father at the station , and she was still straining her eyes to catch the last glimpse of home . She could see the two poplars at the gate almost last of all , as the train bore her out into the open country . She looked through her tears at the fields and hills , the stretches of woodland and the old farm-houses , with the vines clambering over their porches , and the tomatoes ripening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is pleasure always in travelling through Western Ontario , particularly on the lake-side , between Hamilton and Toronto . Almost the first one Beth saw , as the train entered Toronto station , was Clarence , scanning the car-windows eagerly for her face . Her eyes beamed as he came toward her . She felt as if at home again . Marie had secured her room for her , and Beth looked around with a pleased air when the cab stopped on St. Mary 's street . It was a row of three-storey brick houses , all alike , but a cheery , not monotonous , row , with the maples in front , and Victoria University at the end of the street . A plump , cheery landlady saw Beth to her room , and , once alone , she did just what hundreds of other girls have done in her place -- sat down on that big trunk and wept , and wondered what " dear old daddy " was doing . But she soon controlled herself , and looked around the room . It was a very pretty room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner . There was a large window , too , opening to the south , with a view of St. Michael 's College and St. Basil 's Church . Beth realized that this room was to be her home for the coming months , and , kneeling down , she asked that the presence of Christ might hallow it . She was not a very close follower of Christ , but the weakest child of God never breathed a prayer unheard . It was such a pleasant treat when Marie tapped at the door just before tea . It would be nice to have Marie there all winter . Beth looked around the tea-table at the new faces : Mrs. Owen , at one end of the table , decidedly stout ; Mr. Owen , at the other end , decidedly lean . There were two sweet-faced children , a handsome , gloomy-browed lawyer , and Marie at her side . The next day , Clarence took Beth over to ' Varsity -- as Toronto University is popularly called -- and she never forgot that bright autumn morning when she passed under the arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls thronged with students . Clarence left her in the care of a gentle fourth-year girl . Beth was taken from lecturer to lecturer until the registering was done , and then she stopped by one of the windows in the ladies ' dressing-room to gaze at the beautiful autumn scenery around -- the ravine , with its dark pines , and the Parliament buildings beyond . Beth was beginning to love the place . We must not pause long over that first year that Beth spent at ' Varsity . It passed like a flash to her , the days were so constantly occupied . But her memory was being stored with scenes she never forgot . It was so refreshing on the brisk , autumn mornings to walk to lectures through the crimson and yellow leaves of Queen 's Park : and , later in the year , when the snow was falling she liked to listen to the rooks cawing among the pines behind the library . Sometimes , too , she walked home alone in the weird , winter twilight from the Modern Language Club , or from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there were the social evenings in the gymnasium , with its red , blue and white decorations , palms and promenades , and music of the orchestra , and hum of strange voices . It was all new to Beth ; she had seen so little of the world . There was the reception the Y.W.C.A. gave to the " freshettes " she enjoyed that , too . What kind girls they were ! Beth was not slow to decide that the " ' Varsity maid " would make a model wife , so gentle and kindly and with such a broad , progressive mind . Still Beth made hardly any friendships worthy of the name that first year . She was peculiar in this respect . In a crowd of girls she was apt to like all , but to love none truly . When she did make friends she came upon them suddenly , by a sort of instinct , as in the case of Marie , and became so absorbed in them she forgot everyone else . This friendship with Marie was another feature of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sunday-school work . She thought city Sunday-schools chilly , and she spent many a Sunday afternoon in Marie 's room . She liked to sit there in the rocker by the grate fire , and listen to Marie talk as she reclined in the cushions , with her dark , picturesque face . They talked of love and life and books and music , and the world and its ways , for Marie was clever and thoughtful . In after years Beth looked back on those Sunday afternoons with a shadow of regret , for her feet found a sweeter , holier path . Marie prided herself on a little tinge of scepticism , but they rarely touched on that ground . The twilight shadows gathered about the old piano in the corner , and the pictures grew dimmer on the wall , and Marie would play soft love-songs on her guitar , and sometime Beth would recite one of her poems . " Have you finished the novel you were writing last summer , Beth ? " asked Marie , one day . " No , there are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them till holidays , next summer , so I can give them my full time and attention . " " Tell me the story . " Then Beth sat by the fire with a dreamy look on her face and told the plot of her story . Marie leaned forward , a bright , delighted sparkle in her dark eyes . Beth had never interested her like that before . She felt encouraged , and Marie was in raptures when she had finished . " It 's just splendid ! Oh , Beth , how clever you are ; you will be famous soon . I shall be proud of your friendship . " Beth did not enjoy as much of the company of Clarence as she had hoped during these days , though he always brought her home from church on Sunday evening . Marie was always with them . Beth never thought of leaving her , and Clarence , too , seemed to enjoy her company . Beth was pleased at this ; she liked to have Clarence appreciate her friends . Then , they three often went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marie 's face would fairly sparkle sometimes , and change with every wave of music . " Just look ! Is n't Marie 's face grand ? " said Clarence one night in a concert . Beth only smiled . That night she sat in the rocker opposite her mirror and looked at her own reflection . " What a grave , grey-eyed face it is ! " she thought . She loved music and beautiful things , and yet she wondered why her eyes never sparkled and glowed like Marie 's . She wished they had more expression . And yet Marie was not a pretty girl : no one would have thought for a moment of calling her pretty . But what of Arthur ? Beth was surprised that during all this time she had seen him but once , though she lived so near to Victoria . That once was in the University hall . She had studied late one afternoon , in the reading-room , after the other girls were gone , and it was just where the two corridors met that she came face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her studies and her health , and his eyes rested kindly upon her for a moment ; but he did not speak to her just like the old Arthur . " Good-bye , Beth -- little Beth . " She recalled the words as she passed down the long , deserted hall , with its row of lights on either side . There was another thing that touched Beth . It was when Marie left them just before the examinations in the spring ; she was going to visit some friends . Sweet Marie ! How she would miss her . She sat by the drawing-room window waiting to bid her good-bye . It was a bright April day , with soft clouds and a mild breeze playing through the budding trees . Marie came down looking so picturesque under her broad-brimmed hat , and lifted her veil to receive Beth 's farewell kiss . Beth watched her as she crossed the lawn to the cab . Clarence came hurrying up to clasp her hand at the gate . He looked paler , Beth thought ; she hoped he would come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried away . Beth felt a little sad at heart ; she looked at the long , empty drawing-room , and sighed faintly , then went back upstairs to her books . And what had that winter brought to Beth ? She had grown ; she felt it within herself . Her mind had stretched out over the great wide world with its millions , and even over the worlds of the sky at night , and at times she had been overwhelmed at the glory of earth 's Creator . Yes , she had grown ; but with her growth had come a restlessness ; she felt as though something were giving way beneath her feet like an iceberg melting in mild waters . There was one particular night that this restlessness had been strong . She had been to the Modern Language Club , and listened to a lecture on Walt Whitman , by Dr. Needler . She had never read any of Whitman 's poetry before , she did not even like it . But there were phrases and sentences here and there , sometimes of Whitman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange incoherent music in her soul -- a new chord was struck . It was almost dark when she reached her room , at the close of a stormy winter day . She stood at her window watching the crimson and black drifts of cloud piled upon each other in the west . Strife and glory she seemed to read in that sky . She thought of Whitman 's rugged manliness , of the way he had mingled with all classes of men -- mingled with them to do them good . And Beth 's heart cried out within her , only to do something in this great , weary world -- something to uplift , to ennoble men , to raise the lowly , to feed and to clothe the uncared for , to brighten the millions of homes , to lift men -- she knew not where . This cry in Beth 's heart was often heard after that -- to be great , to do something for others . She was growing weary of the narrow boundaries of self . She would do good , but she knew not how . She heard a hungry world crying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craved . Poor , blinded bird , beating against the bars of heaven ! Clarence never seemed to understand her in those moods : he had no sympathy with them . Alas , he had never known Beth Woodburn ; he had understood her intellectual nature , but he had never sounded the depths of her womanly soul . He did not know she had a heart large enough to embrace the whole world , when once it was opened . Poor , weak , blinded Clarence ! She was as much stronger than he , as the star is greater than the moth that flutters towards it . CHAPTER VII . ENDED . June was almost over , and Beth had been home a full month on that long four months ' vacation that university students are privileged to enjoy . She was very ambitious when she came home that first vacation . She had conceived a fresh ideal of womanhood , a woman not only brilliantly educated and accomplished , but also a gentle queen of the home , one who thoroughly understood the work of her home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an art , and Dr. Woodburn looked through the open kitchen-door with a smile at his daughter hidden behind a clean white apron and absorbed in the mysteries of the pastry board . Aunt Prudence was a little astonished , but she never would approve of Beth 's way of doing things --  " did n't see the sense of a note-book and lead-pencil . " But Beth knew what she was doing in that respect . Then there were so many books that Beth intended to read in that vacation ! Marie had come to the Mayfair 's , too , and helped her to pass some pleasant hours . But there was something else that was holding Beth 's attention . It was Saturday evening , and that story was almost finished , that story on which she had built so many hopes . She sat in her room with the great pile of written sheets before her , almost finished ; but her head was weary , and she did not feel equal to writing the closing scene that night . She wanted it to be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rolled up for another week . Just then the door-bell rang and Mrs. Ashley was announced , our old friend Edith Mayfair , the same sweet , fair girl under another name . They sat down by the window and had a long chat . " Have you seen the new minister and his wife yet ? " asked Edith . " No ; I heard he was going to preach to-morrow . " The Rev. Mr. Perth , as the new Methodist minister , was just now occupying the attention of Briarsfield . " It 's interesting to have new people come to town . I wonder if they will be very nice . Are they young ? " asked Beth . " Yes . They have n't been married so very long . " " Edith "  - -  Beth hesitated before she finished the quietly eager enquiry --  " do you still think marriage the best thing in the world ? " Edith gave her friend a warm embrace in reply . " Yes , Beth , I think it the very best thing , if God dwell in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Beth . " Do you ever hear of him . Where is he ? " " I do n't know where he is , " said Beth , with a half sigh . Clarence walked home with Beth to dinner , after church , the next morning . " How do you like the new minister ? " Beth asked . " Oh , I think he 's a clever little fellow . " " So do I , " said Beth . " He seems to be a man of progressive ideas . I think we shall have bright , interesting sermons . " Marie was slightly ill that Sunday , and did not come out . Clarence and Beth took a stroll in the moonlight . The world looked bright and beautiful beneath the stars , but Clarence was quieter even than usual , and Beth sighed faintly . Clarence was growing strangely quiet and unconfidential . He was certainly not a demonstrative lover . Perhaps , after all , love was not all she had dreamed . She had painted her dreamland too bright . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but her heart was a little hungry that summer night . Poor Beth ! Before another Sabbath she was to know a greater pain than mere weariness . The flames were being kindled that were to scorch that poor heart of hers . It was about ten o'clock the next night when she finished her novel . Somehow it gave her a grave feeling . Aunt Prudence was in bed , and Dr. Woodburn had gone out into the country to a patient , and would not return till midnight . The house was so still , and the sky and the stars so beautiful ; the curtains of her open window just moved in the night air ! It was all ended now -- that dreamland which she had lived and loved and gave expression to on those sheets of paper . Ended ! And she was sitting there with her pen in her hand , her work finished , bending over it as a mother does over her child . She almost dreaded to resign it to a publisher , to cast it upon the world . And yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure of that . The last scene alone would make her famous . She could almost see the sweet earnest-eyed woman in her white robes at the altar ; she could hear the sound of voices and the tread of feet ; she was even conscious of the fragrance of the flowers . It was all so vivid to her ! Then a sudden impulse seized her . She would like so much to show it to Clarence , to talk to him , and feel his sympathy . He never retired much before midnight , and it was scarcely ten minutes ' walk . She would get back before her father returned , and no one would know . Seizing her hat , she went quietly out . It was a freak , but then Beth had freaks now and then . A great black cloud drifted over the moon , and made everything quite dark . A timid girl would have been frightened , but Beth was not timid . She knew Clarence was likely to be in the library , and so went around to the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of the side hall , and as Beth came up the terrace , through the open window a picture met her eyes that held her spell-bound . Clarence and Marie were sitting side by side on the sofa , a few feet from the window . Marie 's dark face was drooping slightly , her cheeks flushed , and her lips just parted in a smile . There was a picture of the Crucifixion on the wall above them , and rich violet curtains hanging to one side . One of Marie 's slender olive hands rested on the crimson cushions at her side , the other Clarence was stroking with a tender touch . Both were silent for a moment . Then Clarence spoke in a soft , low tone : " Marie , I want to tell you something . " " Do you ? Then tell me . " " I do n't like to say it , " he answered . " Yes , do . Tell me . " " If I were not an engaged man , " his voice seemed to tremble faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and win you for my wife . " Beth drew back a step , her young cheek colorless as death . No cry escaped her white lips , but her heart almost ceased its beating . It was only a moment she stood there , but it seemed like years . The dark , blushing girl , the weak , fair-haired youth in whom she had placed her trust , the pictures , the cushions , the curtains , every detail of the scene , seemed printed with fire upon her soul . She was stung . She had put her lips to the cup of bitterness , and her face looked wild and haggard as she turned away . Only the stars above and the night wind sighing in the leaves , and a heart benumbed with pain ! A tall man passed her in the shadow of the trees as she was crossing the lawn , but she paid no heed . The lights in the village homes were going out one by one as she returned up the dark , deserted street . The moon emerged from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural light just as she entered . She threw herself upon her pillow , and a cry of pain went up from her wounded heart . She started the next instant in fear lest some one had heard . But no , there was no one near here , save that loving One who hears every moan ; and Beth had not learned yet that He can lull every sufferer to rest in His bosom . The house was perfectly still , and she lay there in the darkness and silence , no line changing in the rigid marble of her face . She heard her father 's step pass by in the hall ; then the old clock struck out the midnight hour , and still she lay in that stupor with drops of cold perspiration on her brow . Suddenly a change came over her . Her cheeks grew paler still , but her eyes burned . She rose and paced the room , with quick , agitated steps . " Traitress ! Traitress ! " she almost hissed through her white lips . " It is her fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . Friend ! Treachery ! " Then she sank upon her bed , exhausted by the outburst of passion , for it took but little of this to exhaust Beth . She was not a passionate girl . Perhaps , never in her life before had she passed through anything like passion , and she lay there now still and white , her hands folded as in death . In the meantime something else had happened at the Mayfair dwelling . She had not noticed the tall man that passed her as she crossed the lawn in the darkness , but a moment later a dark figure paused on the terrace in the same spot where she had stood , and his attention was arrested by the same scene in the library . He paused but a moment before entering , but even his firm tread was unheard on the soft carpet , as he strode up the hall to the half-open curtains of the library . Marie 's face was still drooping , but the next instant the curtains were thrown back violently , and they both paled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door-way . " Clarence Mayfair ! " he cried in a voice of stern indignation . " Clarence Mayfair , you dare to speak words of love to that woman at your side ? You ! Beth Woodburn 's promised husband ? " " Arthur Grafton ! " exclaimed Clarence , and Marie drew back through the violet curtains . A firm hand grasped Clarence by the shoulder , and , white with fear , he stood trembling before his accuser . " Wretch ! unworthy wretch ! And you claim her hand ! Do you know her worth ? " " In the name of heaven , Grafton , do n't alarm the house ! " said Clarence , in a terrified whisper . His lip trembled with emotion , and Arthur 's dark eyes flashed with fire . There was a shade of pitiful scorn in them , too . After all , what a mere boy this delicate youth looked , he thought . Perhaps he was too harsh . He had only heard a sentence or two outside the window , and he might have judged too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wronged her , " said Clarence , in a choked voice ; " but do n't betray me ! " There was a ring of true penitence and sorrow in the voice that touched Arthur , and as he raised his face to that picture of the Crucifixion on the wall , it softened gradually . " Well , perhaps I am severe . May God forgive you , Clarence . But it is hard for a man to see another treat the woman he -- well , there , I 'll say no more . Only promise me you will be true to her -- more worthy of her . " " I will try , Arthur . Heaven knows I have always meant to be honorable . " " Then , good-bye , Clarence . Only you need not tell Beth you have seen me to-night , " said Arthur , as he turned to leave ; " I shall be out of Briarsfield before morning . " Poor Arthur ! Time had not yet healed his wound , but he was one of those brave souls who can " suffer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through Briarsfield on the late train , a desire had seized him to go back to the old place just once more , to walk up and down for a little while before the home of the woman he loved . He did not care to speak to her or to meet her face to face . She was another 's promised wife . Only to be near her home -- to breathe one deep blessing upon her , and then to leave before break of day , and she would never know he had been near . He had come under cover of the darkness , and had seen her descending the great wide stairway in her white muslin dress , and going down the dark street toward the Mayfairs ' . After a little while he had followed , even approached the windows of Clarence Mayfair 's home , hoping for one last look . But he had passed her in the shadow of the trees , and had only seen what filled his heart with sorrow . A meaner man would have taken advantage of the sight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean soul . He believed Beth loved Clarence , as he thought a woman should love the man to whom she gives her life . He believed that God was calling him to the mission-field alone . He had only caught a few words that Clarence had said to Marie , and he fancied it may , after all , have been mere nonsense . Surely he could not have ceased to love Beth ! Surely he could not be blind to her merits ! Arthur saw only too truly how weak , emotional and changeable Clarence was , but it was not his place to interfere with those whom God had joined . So he argued to himself . But the night was passing , and Beth still lay there , no tear on her cold white cheeks . The clock struck one , a knell-like sound in the night ! Beth lay there , her hands folded on her breast , the prayer unuttered by her still lips -- one for death . The rest were sleeping quietly in their beds . They knew nothing of her suffering . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but come now , and still her weary heart ! They would come in the morning to look at her . Yes ; Clarence would come , too . Perhaps he would love her just a little then . Perhaps he would think of her tenderly when he saw her with the white roses in her hands . Oh , was there a God in heaven who could look down on her sorrow to-night , and not in pity call her home ? She listened for the call that would bear her far beyond this earthly strife , where all was such tangle and confusion . She listened , but she heard it not , and the darkness deepened , the moon grew pale and the stars faded away . The house was so still ! The whistle of a steam-engine broke the silence , and she saw the red light as the train swept around the curve . It was bearing Arthur away , and she did not know that one who loved her had been so near ! Then she saw a grey gleam in the east . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming again , and she would have to face them all . She would sit in the same place at the breakfast table . She would meet Clarence again , and Marie -- oh -- oh , she could not bear the thought of it ! She sat up on her bedside with such a weary , anguished look in her eyes ! Then she went to kneel at the open window , where her mother had taught her to kneel long years ago . Her sweet-faced , long-dead mother ! When she raised her eyes again the east was all aglow with the pink and purple dawn , and the rooks were cawing in the pines across the meadow . She paced the floor for a moment or two . " Yes , it must be done . I will do it , " she thought . " He loves her . I will not stand in the way of his happiness . No ; I had rather die . " And she took a sheet of note-paper , and wrote these simple words : " DEAR CLARENCE ,  - -  I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife . I know your secret . I know you love Marie . I have seen it often in your eyes . Be happy with her , and forget me . May you be very happy , always . Good-bye . BETH . " She took it herself to the Mayfair home , knowing that her father would only think she had gone out for a morning walk . The smoke-wreaths were curling upward from the kitchen chimneys as she passed down the street , and Squire Mayfair looked a little surprised when she handed him her note for Clarence , and turned to walk away . That sleepless , tearless night had told upon her , and she was not able to come down to breakfast . Her father came in , and looked at her with a professional air . " Just what I told you , Beth . You 've worked too hard . You need rest . That 's just what 's the matter , " he said , in a brusque voice , as he put some medicine on the table and left the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her work was done . She looked at the sheet of manuscript that she had taken last night to show Clarence . Yes , the work was done . She had reached the end of her story -- the end of her prospect of marriage . Ended her labor -- ended her life-dream ! As for Clarence , he read her note without any emotion . " Humph ! I did n't think Grafton was the fellow to make mischief so quickly . A tale-bearer ! Well , it 's all for the best . I made a mistake . I do not love Beth Woodburn . I can not understand her . " Beth slept , and seemed much better in the afternoon , but she was still quite pale when she went into her father 's room after tea . " Dear old daddy , " she said , putting her arms about his neck , " you were always so kind . You never refuse me anything if you can help it . I wish you would let me go away . " " Why , certainly , Beth , dear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've been telling you ? Stop writing all day in that hot room up-stairs . Go off and have a frolic . Go and see your Aunt Margaret . " And so it was settled that if Beth were well enough she should start for Welland next afternoon . She did not see Clarence during the next morning . It surprised her that he sought no explanation , and before three o'clock Briarsfield was a mere speck in the distance . CHAPTER VIII . THE HEAVENLY CANAAN . Nearly two months later Beth returned home . Marie had broken off her visit abruptly , and Clarence had gone away . It was a rainy Saturday , and Beth sat waiting for her father to finish his rounds . Her visit had refreshed her , and she looked fairly well again . After all , she had so many bright prospects ! She was young and talented . Her novel was finished . She would read it through at once , making minor corrections , and then publish it . With all youth 's hopefulness , she was sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She seemed to see a rich harvest-field before her as she sat listening to the rain beat on the roof that summer afternoon . But , after all , she was not happy . Somehow , life was all so hollow ! So much tangle and confusion ! Her young feet were weary . It was not simply that her love was unreturned . That pained her far less than she would have thought . It was that her idol was shattered . Only in the last few weeks had she begun to see Clarence Mayfair as he really was . It was a wonderfully deep insight into human nature that Beth had ; but she had never applied it where Clarence was concerned before , and now that she did , what was it she saw ?  - -  a weak , wavering , fickle youth , with a good deal of fine sentiment , perhaps , but without firm , manly strength ; ambitious , it was true , but never likely to fulfil his ambitions . The sight pained her . And yet this was the one she had exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mind had fine fibre in it , but he who would soar must have strength as well as wings . Beth saw clearly just what Clarence lacked , and what can pain a woman more deeply than to know the object she has idealized is unworthy ? Beth had not told her father yet that all was at an end between her and Clarence . She dreaded telling him that , but she knew he must have learned it from the Mayfairs during her absence . She sighed as she thought of it all , and just then Dr. Woodburn came in and sat down on the couch beside her . They talked until the twilight of that rainy afternoon began to deepen . Then they were silent for a while , and Beth saw her father looking at her with a tender look in his eyes . " Beth , my dear child , what is wrong between you and Clarence ? " She had believed she could tell him all with perfect calmness , but there was something so very gentle in his look and voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck , and burst into tears . " Oh , father , dear , I could not marry him . It would not be right . He loves Marie de Vere . " Dr. Woodburn turned away his face , tenderly stroking her hair as she leaned upon his breast . He spoke no word , but she knew what he felt . " Oh , daddy , dear , do n't think anything about it , " she said , giving him a warm embrace as she looked up at him , smiling through her tears . " I 'm not unhappy . I have so many things to think of , and I have always you , you dear old father . I love you better than anyone else on earth . I will be your own little daughter always . " She pressed her arms about him more tightly , and there were tears in his eyes as he stooped to kiss her brow . Beth thought of all his tenderness that night as she lay in bed , and then slept , with the rain beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath morning when she awoke . She remembered with pleasure how much she had liked Mr. Perth , the new minister , that Sunday . She had heard him before she went away . He had seemed such an energetic , wide-awake , inspiring man ! Beth liked that stamp of people . She meant to be a progressive girl . She meant to labor much and to have much success . She was quite early at church that morning , and interested herself by looking at Mrs. Perth , whom she had never seen before . She was a fair , slender , girlish creature -- very youthful indeed for a married woman . She had a great mass of light hair , drawn back plainly from a serenely fair forehead . The fashion became her well , for , in fact , the most striking thing about her face was its simplicity and purity . She was certainly plain-looking , but Beth fancied her face looked like the white cup of a lily . She had such beautiful blue eyes , too , and such a sweet smile . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great friends , " thought Beth , after she had had an introduction to Mrs. Perth ; and they did become fast friends . Beth had seldom been at Sunday-school since she left home , but an impulse seized her to go this afternoon . She was quite early , and she sat down in a seat by herself to muse awhile . She gazed at the lilies about the altar and the stained-glass windows above the organ . How long it seemed to look back to that Sunday of two months ago ! She shuddered slightly , and tried to change her thoughts , but she could not help going back to it . It seemed as though years had since passed . So it is always . We go about our daily tasks , and the time passes swiftly or slowly , according as our lives are active or monotonous . Then a crisis comes -- an upheaval -- a turn in the current . It lasts but a moment , perhaps , but when we look back , years seem to have intervened . Beth gave a half sigh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured into the Bible-class . Mrs. Perth came and sat beside Beth . Is it not strange how , in this world of formality and convention , we meet someone now and again , and there is but a look , a word , a , smile , and we feel that we have known them so long ? There is something familiar in their face , and we seem to have walked beside them all along the way . It was just so with Beth and Mrs. Perth . Sweet May Perth ! She soon learned to call her that . Beth was never to forget that Sunday afternoon . Mr. Perth taught the Bible-class . He was an enthusiastic man , reminding her somewhat of Arthur . They were studying , that day , the approach of the Israelites to Canaan , and as Mr. Perth grew more earnest , Beth 's face wore a brighter look of interest . Soon he laid aside historical retrospect , and talked of the heavenly Canaan toward which Christ 's people were journeying , a bright land shining in the sunlight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He looked so happy as he talked of that Divine love , changeless throughout all time , throughout all eternity -- a love that never forsakes , that lulls the weary like a cradle-song , a love that satisfies even the secret longings ! Oh , that woman heart of hers , how it yearned , yea , hungered for a love like that love , that could tread the earth in humiliation , bearing the cross of others ' guilt , dying there at Calvary ! She knew that old , old story well , but she drank it in like a little wondering child to-day . What were those things He promised to those who would tread the shining pathway ? Life , peace , rest , hope , joy of earth , joy of heaven ! Oh , how she longed to go with them ! The tears were standing in her eyes , and her heart was beating faster . But this one thing she must do , or turn aside from the promised land of God 's people . Down at the feet of Jesus she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written ? Could she carry that over into this heavenly Canaan ? " The fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is . " Hers would perish , she knew that well . Highly moral , highly refined and scholarly , but what of its doubts , its shadows , its sorrows without hope , its supernatural gloom ? Beth was a master-artist in the field of gloom . She knew how to make her readers shudder , but would that story of hers bring more joy into the world ? Would it sweeten life and warm human hearts ? Ah , no ! And yet , could she destroy it now , before its publication ? Could she bear the thought of it ? She loved it almost as a mother loves her child . A look of indecision crossed her face . But , just then , she seemed to hear the bells of heaven ringing forth their sweet Gospel call . The bright sunshine and the angel voices of a higher life seemed to break in on her soul . In a moment -- she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was hardly a year since she had said nay to Arthur , when he asked her to lay her life at the feet of that same Jesus of Nazareth . She refused then , and even one hour ago she would still have refused ; but now she would have trudged the highways , poverty-stricken , unknown and obscure , for His dear sake . She would have gone forth , like St. Paul , to the uttermost ends of the earth , she felt she loved Him so ! There were tears in her eyes , and a new joy seemed to throb in her heart . She felt so kindly to everyone about her . Was it an impulse or what ? She laid her hand softly on May Perth 's as she sat beside her , and May , looking into her eyes , seemed to read her heart . She held her hand with a warm , loving pressure , and they were friends from that hour . Even the sunlight looked more golden when Beth stepped out into it that afternoon . Everything had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour had been a turning-point in her life . She had found the secret of life -- the secret of putting self utterly into the background and living for others ' happiness ; and they who find that secret have the key to their own happiness . The old tinge of gloom in her grey eyes passed away , and , instead , there came into them the warmth and light of a new life . They seemed to reach out over the whole world with tender sympathy , like a deep , placid sea , with the sunlight gilding , its depths . " Beth , you are growing beautiful , " her father said to her one day ; and there were something so reverential in his look that it touched her too deeply to make her vain . The four weeks that remained before the first of October , when she was to return to college , passed quickly . Clarence did not return , and she heard that he had gone to England , intending to take his degree at Cambridge . The Ashleys , too , had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Toronto . Beth heard nothing more of Marie , though she would so gladly have forgiven her now ! Beth soon became quite absorbed in her new friend , May Perth . She told her one day of her fancy that her face looked like a lily-cup . Mrs. Perth only laughed and kissed her , in her sweet , unconscious way . Beth always loved to kiss May Perth 's brow ; it was so calm and fair , it reminded her of the white breast of a dove . Just three or four days before Beth was to go away , Aunt Prudence came into her room at a time when she was alone . " Did you ever see this picture that Arthur left in his room when he went away last fall ? " she asked . " I do n't know whether he did it himself or not . " She placed it in the light and left the room . Beth recognized it almost instantly . " Why , it 's that poem of mine that Arthur liked best of all ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks rising one above another , the broad white shore , and the lonely cottage , with the dark storm-clouds lowering above it , and the fisherman 's bride at the window , pale and anxious , her sunny hair falling about her shoulders as she peered far out across the sea -- the black , storm-tossed sea -- and far out among the billows the tiny speck of sail that never reached the shore . Beth was no connoisseur of art , but she knew the picture before her was intensely beautiful , even sublime . There was something in it that made her feel . It moved her to tears even as Arthur 's music had done . No need to tell her both came from the same hand . Besides , no one else had seen that poem but Arthur . And Arthur could paint like this , and yet she had said he had not an artist soul . She sighed faintly . Poor Arthur ! Perhaps , after all , she had been mistaken . And she laid the picture carefully away among her treasures . Her last evening at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and they had a fire in the drawing-room grate . It was so cosy to sit there with her father , resting her head on his shoulders , and watching the coals glowing in the twilight . " Beth , my child , you look so much happier lately . Are you really so happy ? " he said , after they had been talking for a while . " Oh , I think life is so very happy ! " said Beth , in a buoyant tone . " And when you love Jesus it is so much sweeter , and somehow I like everyone so much and everybody is so kind . Oh , I think life is grand ! " Dr. Woodburn was a godly man , and his daughter 's words thrilled him sweetly . He brushed away a tear she did not see , and stooped to kiss the young cheek resting on his coat-sleeve . They were silent for a few moments . " Beth , my dear , " he said in a softer tone , " Do you know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . How is it , Beth ? " She hesitated a moment . " I do n't believe I really loved him , father , " she said , in a quiet tone , " I thought I did . I thought it was going to break my heart that night I found out he loved Marie . But , somehow , I do n't mind . I think it is far better as it is . Oh , daddy , dear , it 's so nice I can tell you things like this . I do n't believe all girls can talk to their fathers this way . But I -- I always wanted to be loved -- and Clarence was different from other people in Briarsfield , you know , and I suppose I thought we were meant for each other . " Dr. Woodburn did not answer at once . " I do n't think you would have been happy with him , Beth , " he said , after a little . " All has been for the best . I was afraid you did n't know what love meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school-girl 's fancy . " " Beth , I am going to tell you something , " he said a moment later , as he stroked her hair . " People believe that I always took a special interest in Arthur Grafton because his father saved my life when we were boys , but that was not the only reason I loved him . Years ago , down along the Ottawa river , Lawrence Grafton was pastor in the town where I had my first practice . He was a grand fellow , and we were the greatest friends . I used to take him to see my patients often . He was just the one to cheer them up . Poor fellow ! Let 's see , it 's seventeen years this fall since he died . It was the first summer I was there , and Lawrence had driven out into the country with me to see a sick patient . When we were coming back , he asked me to stop with him at a farm-house , where some members of his church lived . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old red brick building , with honeysuckle climbing about the porch and cherry-trees on the lawn . The front door was open , and there was a flight of stairs right opposite , and while we waited for an answer to the bell a beautiful woman , tall and graceful , paused at the head of the stairs above us , and then came down . To my eyes she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen , Beth . She was dressed in white , and had a basket of flowers on her arm . She smiled as she came towards us . Her hair was glossy-black , parted in the middle , and falling in waves about her smooth white forehead ; but her eyes were her real beauty , I never saw anything like them , Beth . They were such great , dark , tender eyes . They seemed to have worlds in them . It was not long before I loved Florence Waldon . I loved her . " His voice had a strange , deep pathos in it . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , and one day I saw her bidding good-bye to Lawrence . It was only a look and a hand-clasp , but it was a revelation to me . I kept silent about my love from that hour , and one evening Lawrence came to my rooms . " ' Congratulate me , Arthur ! ' he cried , in a tone that bubbled over with joy . I knew what was coming , but the merciful twilight concealed my face . ' Congratulate me , Arthur ! I am going to marry Florence Waldon next month , and you must be best man . ' " I did congratulate him from the depth of my heart , and I was best man at the wedding ; and when their little son was born they named him Arthur after me . He is the Arthur Grafton you have known . But poor Lawrence ! Little Arthur was only a few months old when she took sick . They called me in , and I did all I could to save her , but one night , as Lawrence and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wind was moaning through the shutters while she slept -- suddenly she opened her eyes with a bright look . " ' Oh , Lawrence , listen , they are singing ! ' she cried , ' it is so beautiful ; I am going home -- good-bye -- take care of Arthur , ' and she was gone . " Dr. Woodburn paused a moment , and his breath came faster . " After that I came to Briarsfield and met your mother , Beth . She seemed to understand from my face that I had suffered , and after we had become friends I told her that story , that I had never told to mortal before or since till now . She was so very tender , and I saw in her face that she loved me , and by-and-by I took her to wife , and she healed over the wound with her gentle hands . She was a sweet woman , Beth . God bless her memory . But the strange part of the story is , Florence Waldon 's brother , Garth , had settled on that farm over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two other brothers , one a talented editor in the States , the other a successful lawyer . Garth , too , was a bright , original fellow ; he had a high standard of farm life , and he lived up to it . He was a good man and a truly refined one , and when poor Lawrence died he left little Arthur -- he was three years old then -- to him . The dear little fellow ; he looked so much like his mother . He used to come and hold you in his arms when you were in long dresses , and then , do you remember a few years later , when your own sweet mother died , how he came to comfort you and filled your lap with flowers ? " Yes , Beth remembered it all , and the tears were running down her cheeks as she drooped her head in silence . The door-bell broke the stillness just then . Dr. Woodburn was wanted . Bidding Beth a hasty but tender good-bye , he hurried off at the call of duty . Beth sat gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor dear old father ! What a touching story it was ! He must have suffered so , and yet he had buried his sorrow and gone about his work with smiling face . Brave , heroic soul ! Beth fell to picturing it all over again with that brilliant imagination of hers , until she seemed to see the tall woman , with her beautiful dark eyes and hair , coming down the stairs , just as he had seen her . She seemed to hear the March winds moan as he stepped out into the night and left the beautiful young wife , pale in death . Then she went to the window and looked out at the stars in the clear sky , and the meadow tinged with the first frost of autumn ; and the pine-wood to the north , with the moon hanging like a crescent of silver above it . It was there , at that window , Arthur had asked her to be his wife . Poor Arthur ! She was glad her father did not know . It would have pained him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had loved . Beth lingered a little , gazing at the clear frosty scene before her , then rose with a firm look on her face and went up to her room . There was one thing more to be done before she left home to-morrow . She had resolved upon it . It was dark in her room , but she needed no light to recognize that roll of manuscript in her drawer . She hesitated a moment as she touched it tenderly . Must she do it ? Yes , ah , yes ! She could not publish that story now . Just then the picture of Arthur seemed to flash through her mind , reading it and tossing it down with that cold , silent look she had sometimes seen on his face . It was dark in the hall as she carried it down to the drawing-room grate . She crouched down on the hearth-rug before the coals , and a moment later the flames that played among the closely-written sheets lighted her face . Nothing but a blackened parchment now for all that proud dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coals cracking and snapping , and the steady ticking of the old clock on the mantel piece above her head , broke the stillness . It was done . She went to the window and knelt down . " Father , I have sacrificed it for Thee . Take this talent Thou hast given me and use it for Thy honor , for I would serve Thee alone , Father . " She slept that night with a smile on her lips . Yes , friend , it was a hero 's deed , and He who alone witnessed it hath sealed her brow with a light such as martyrs wear in heaven . As for the world , oh , that every book filled with dark doubts and drifting fears and shuddering gloom had perished , too , in those flames ! CHAPTER IX . ' VARSITY AGAIN . In a few days Beth was settled again at Mrs. Owen 's , on St. Mary 's Street , and tripping to her lectures as usual . Marie was not there , of course , and Beth knew nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete change of boarders . The house was filled with ' Varsity girls this year , with the exception of Marie 's old room , a change which Beth appreciated . One of the girls was a special friend of hers , a plump , dignified little creature whom most people called pretty . Hers was certainly a jolly face , with those rosy cheeks and laughing brown eyes , and no one could help loving Mabel Clayton . She belonged to the Students ' Volunteer Movement , and as this was her last year at college , Beth thought sometimes a little sorrowfully of the following autumn when she was to leave for India . Beth meant to have her spend a few days at Briarsfield with her next summer . But a good many things were to happen to Beth before the next summer passed . A Victoria student was occupying Marie 's old room , but as he took his meals out of the house Beth never even saw him . One of the girls who saw him in the hall one day described him as " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest was not aroused in the stranger . That was a golden autumn for Beth , the happiest by far she had ever known . She was living life under that sweet plan of beginning every day afresh , and thinking of some little act of kindness to be done . Beth soon began to believe the girls of University College were the very kindest in the world ; but she would have been surprised , to hear how often they remarked , " Beth Woodburn is always so kind ! " There was another treat that she was enjoying this year , and that was Dr. Tracy 's lectures . " I think he is an ideal man , " she remarked once to Mabel Clayton . " I 'm not in love with him , but I think he 's an ideal man . " Mabel was an ardent admirer of Dr. Tracy 's , too , but she could not help laughing at Beth 's statement . " You are such a hero-worshipper , Beth ! " she said . " You put a person up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sun . " A peculiar look crossed Beth 's face . She remembered one whom she had placed on the pedestal of genius , and the idol had fallen , shattered at her feet . She was still the same emotional Beth . There were times when without any outward cause , seemingly from a mere overflow of happiness , she almost cried out , " Oh stay , happy moment , till I drink to the full my draught of joy ! " Arthur 's painting hung above Beth 's study table , and sometimes a shadow crossed her face as she looked at it . She missed the old friendship , and she wondered , too , that she never met him anywhere . Beth did not go home at Thanksgiving that year , and she almost regretted it the evening before . She was a little homesick for " daddy , " and to dispel her loneliness she shut up her books and went to bed early . Her head had scarcely touched the pillow when , hark ! there was a sound of music in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was so like Arthur 's music . She was not at all familiar with the piece , but it thrilled her somehow . There was a succession , of sweet , mellow notes at first ; then higher , higher , higher , broader , deeper , fuller , it was bearing her very soul away ! Then sweeter , softer , darker , tint of gold and touch of shadow , the tears were standing in her eyes ! Clearer again , and more triumphant ! Her lips parted as she listened . One sweet prolonged swell , and it died away . She listened for more , but all was silent . She looked out of the window at the stars in the clear sky , and the dark shadow of St. Michael 's tower on the snow-covered college roof , then fell back among the pillows to sleep and dream . She was walking again on the old path by the road-side at home , just as she used to go every evening for the milk . The dusk was deepening and she began to hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she drew nearer she recognized Arthur 's broad shoulders and well-set head . Then a strange , indefinable fear seized her . She did not want to overtake him , to meet him face to face . She tried to slacken her steps , but a mysterious , resistless wind seemed to bear her forward against her will . Not a leaf stirred . All was still around her , and yet that uncanny , spirit-like wind urged her on . She struggled , and although Arthur never looked back , she felt that he knew all about her struggles . At last she made one mighty effort and tore herself free . She took the path on the other side of the road . It was all quiet there , and she walked on slowly . The darkness grew thicker , and she lost sight of Arthur . Then the country became quite new to her . There were bridges every little way -- old rickety bridges , that creaked beneath her step , with holes where she caught her feet , and she could hear the great wild torrents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , how she wished Arthur were there ! Then suddenly it grew lighter , and she saw that her path was turning , and lo ! there was Arthur ! A moment more and their paths would meet . He reached the spot a few steps before her , and turning , looked at her just once , but she saw in his look that he knew all that had passed in her heart . " Follow me , " he said , with a tender look ; and she followed in silence where the path led between the steep , high banks , where strange flowers were clinging in the dim light . She was quite content now , not frightened any longer . Then the bank opened by their pathway , and he led her into a strange , sandy , desert-looking place . They entered a shadowy tent , and in the dim light she could see strange faces , to whom Arthur was talking . No one noticed her , but she did not feel slighted , for though he did not look at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly the strange faces vanished , and she was alone with Arthur . He came toward her with such a beautiful smile , and there was something in his hand of bright gold -- the brightest gold she had ever seen . It was a golden spear with a tiny ring on one end and a mass of chain hanging to it ; but lo ! when she looked around her she saw it had filled the place with a beautiful mystic light , a golden halo . Then he drew her nearer , nearer to his bosom , and in a moment she felt the spear point touch her heart ! An instant of pain , then it pierced her with a deep , sweet thrill . She felt it even to her finger tips . She awoke with a start , but she could almost feel that thrill even after she was awake . She could not sleep again quickly , but lay watching the stars and the moonlight growing paler on her book-case . Sleep came at length , and when she awoke again it was at the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody up ! " This was a way he had of waking the children in good time for breakfast , and it had the merit of always arousing the boarders , too . Beth naturally supposed that the musician she had heard the night before had been a caller , and so made no enquiries . The following Sunday evening Beth went to church alone . It was only three or four blocks up to the Central , and Beth was never timid . She did not look around the church much , or she would have recognized a familiar face on the east side . It was Clarence Mayfair 's ; he was paler than usual , and his light curly hair looked almost artificial in the gaslight . There was something sadder and more manly in his expression , and his eyes were fixed on Beth with a reverent look . How pure she was , he thought , how serene ; her brow looked as though an angel-hand had smoothed it in her slumber . She seemed to breathe a benediction on everything around her ; she reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he had seen in one of the old cathedral windows across the sea . And yet , after knowing a woman like that , he had fancied he could -- even fancied he did -- love Marie de Vere . What folly had blinded him then , he wondered ? Marie had her charms , to be sure , with those dark , bewitching eyes of hers , so kind and sympathetic , so bright and witty and entertaining . But there was something about Marie that was fleeting , something about Beth that was abiding ; Marie 's charms bewitched while she was present and were soon forgotten , but Beth 's lingered in the memory and deepened with the years . It was well , after all , he thought , that Marie had refused his offer of marriage that morning he received Beth 's note , and went to her in the heat of his passion . He was but a boy then , and yet it was only a few months ago . What was it that had changed him from boyhood to manhood so suddenly ? He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of the change within . He realized now that he had never known what it meant to love . Marie had shed her lustre on him as she passed ; Beth he had never fully comprehended . He had a dim feeling that she was somehow too high for him . But would this reverence he felt for her ripen into love with the maturer years of his manhood ? We never can tell the changes that time will weave in these hearts of ours . It is to be feared Clarence was not a very attentive listener throughout the service that night . At the close he waited for Beth in the moonlight outside , but she did not notice him till he was right beside her . " Clarence ! " she exclaimed , in a tone of astonishment . " Why , I thought you were in England . " " So I was ; but I am back , you see . " " I thought you were going to take a year at Cambridge . " " I did intend to , but I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bother finishing my course . I am doing some work along the journalistic line at present . I just came to Toronto last night , and intend to leave Tuesday or Wednesday . " In the first moment of her surprise she had forgotten everything except that Clarence was an old friend from home ; but now , as he walked beside her , it all came back like a flash -- the memory of that night last summer when she had seen him last . She grew suddenly silent and embarrassed . She longed to ask him about Marie ; she wondered if they were engaged , and if so where she was , but she soon controlled herself and asked him about his trip to England , about his mother , about his work , about Edith and everything else of possible or impossible interest . She was relieved , without knowing why , that it was only a few blocks to her boarding-place . He lingered a moment as he said good-night , and something in his look touched her a little . Only the stirring of old memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him again ; but as she entered her room in the darkness her dream seemed to flash across her memory and a tender voice said , " Follow me . " Clarence strolled a little way into the park , pondering on the past . He had never asked Beth for an explanation of her farewell note . He naturally supposed that Arthur Grafton had gone directly to her that night and caused the rupture . He wondered if Arthur were in love with her . Then he turned suddenly and walked back by St. Mary 's Street to Yonge . The street was almost deserted ; there was only one figure in sight , a tall man drawing nearer . There was No.  - -   - -   , where he had left Beth at the door . He had just passed a few more doors when a familiar voice startled him . It was Arthur Grafton ! Clarence felt ill at ease for a moment , but Arthur 's tone was so kind it dispelled his embarrassment . They talked for a few moments , then parted ; and Clarence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell at Beth 's boarding-place . A peculiar look , almost a sneer , crossed his face for a moment . " Ah , he is going in to spend the evening with his beloved , " he thought . And Clarence resolved , then and there , not to call on Beth the following day , as he had intended . But Arthur proceeded absently to the room Marie had formerly occupied , without the slightest idea that Beth had lived in the house with him nearly two months . It was strange , but though he had seen all the other girls in the house he had never seen Beth . He had not enquired her address the year before , not wishing to know . He wished to have nothing to do with Clarence Mayfair 's promised wife . She was nothing to him . Should he encourage the love he felt for another 's wife ? No ! He had loved with all the strength of that love that comes but once to any human heart , and he had suffered as only the strong and silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , and it had given his face a sterner look . So he lay down to rest that night all unconscious that Beth was in the room just overhead ; that he had heard her footsteps daily , even listened to her humming little airs to unrecognizable tunes ; but the sight of Clarence Mayfair had aroused the past , and he did not sleep till late . The following afternoon , as Beth sat studying in her room after lectures , she heard a faint tap at her door , a timid knock that in some way seemed to appeal strangely to her . She opened the door -- and there stood Marie ! In the first moment of her surprise Beth forgot everything that had separated them , and threw both arms about her in the old child-like way . She seated her in the rocker by the window and they talked of various things for a while , but Beth noticed , now and then , an uneasy look in her eyes . " She has come to tell me she is going to marry Clarence , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a heart full of sympathy . " Beth , " said Marie at last , " I have wronged you . I have come here to ask you to forgive me . " Beth belonged to the kind of people who are always silent in emergencies , so she only looked at her with her great tender eyes , in which there was no trace of resentment . " I came between you and Clarence Mayfair . He never loved me . It was only a fancy . I amused and interested him , I suppose . That was all . He is true to you in the depths of his heart , Beth . It was my fault -- all my fault . He never loved me . It was you he loved , but I encouraged him . It was wrong , I know . " Something seemed to choke her for a moment . " Will you forgive me , Beth ? Can you ever forgive ? " She was leaning forward gracefully , her fur cape falling back from her shoulders and her dark eyes full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderly , forgetting all the bitter thoughts she had once had . " Oh , Marie , dear , I love you -- I love you still . Of course I forgive you . " Then Beth told her all the story of the past , and of that night when she had learned that Clarence did not love her , of her wounded vanity , her mistaken belief in the genuineness of her own love for him , and her gradual awakening to the fact that it was not love after all . " Then it was n't Mr. Grafton at all who made the trouble ? " interrupted Marie . " Mr. Grafton ? Why , no ! What could he have to do with it ? " " Oh , nothing . We thought , at least Clarence thought , he made the trouble . " Beth looked mystified , but Marie only continued in a softened tone : " I am afraid you do n't know your own heart , dear Beth . You will come together again , and all will be forgotten . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better as it is . " A pained look that Beth could not fathom drifted across Marie 's brow . " You think so now , but you will change , " she said . A knock at the door interrupted them just then , as Mrs. Owen announced a friend of Beth 's . Marie kissed her gently . " Good-bye , Beth , " she said in her sweet low voice , and there was a tender sadness in her dark eyes . Beth did not know its meaning at the time , but a day was coming when she would know . Beth saw nothing more of Clarence during his few days in the city . She wondered sometimes if Marie had seen him , but though they saw each other occasionally during the rest of the winter , neither of them mentioned his name . That week had seemed eventful in Beth 's eyes , but it was more eventful even than she thought . The following Saturday , after tea , as Beth and Mabel Clayton were going back upstairs , Beth had seated Mabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her some funny little story . Beth was in one of her merry moods that night . Beth was not a wit , but she had her vein of mirth , and the girls used to say she was growing livelier every day . The gas was not lighted in the hall , but Beth had left her door open and the light shone out on the head of the stairs . A moment later they started up with their arms about each other 's waist . " Oh , Beth , I left that note-book down stairs . Wait , I 'll bring it up to you . " Beth waited , standing in the light as her friend scampered down again . She heard the door of Marie 's old room open , and a tall man stepped into the hall , but as it was dark below she could not see his face . She wondered , though , why he stood so still , and she had a consciousness that someone was looking at her . Arthur Grafton -- for it was he -- stood for a moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he -- hush ! Clarence Mayfair 's promised wife ! She looked even beautiful as she stood there in the light , with a smile on her face and a pure white chrysanthemum at her throat . " You need n't hurry so , Mabel dear . I can wait , " she said as her friend approached . It was over a year since he had heard that voice , and he had tried to believe his heart was deadened to its influence ; but now to-night , at the first sound , it thrilled him again with its old-time music . A moment later she closed her door and the hall was dark , and his heart began to beat faster now that he grasped the truth . He turned again to his room , filled with the soft radiance of moonlight . He leaned back in his study chair , his eyes closed ; he could hear the students of St. Michael 's chanting an evening hymn , and an occasional cab rattled past in the street below . He noted it as we note all little details in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his face . Oh , sweet love ! For one moment it seemed to be mastering him . She was there . Hark ! Was that her footstep overhead ? Oh , to be near her -- to touch her hand just once ! Then a stern , dark frown settled on his brow . He rose and paced the room with a sort of frenzied step . What is she to you -- Clarence Mayfair 's promised wife ? Arthur Grafton , what is she to you ? Oh , that love , deep and passionate , that comes to us but once ! That heart-cry of a strong soul for the one being it has enshrined ! Sometimes it is gratified and bears in after years its fruits , whether sweet or bitter ; or again , it is crushed -- blighted in one moment , perhaps -- and we go forth as usual trying to smile , and the world never knows , never dreams . A few years pass and our hearts grow numb to the pain , and we say we have forgotten -- that love can grow cold . Cold ? Yes ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our dead ideal ! Would such a fate be Arthur 's ? No . There was no room in that great pulsing heart of his for anything that was cold -- no room for the chill of forgetfulness . Strive as he might , he knew he could never forget . What then remained ? Even in that hour a holier radiance lighted his brow . Strong to bear the burdens and sorrows of others , he had learned to cast all his care upon One who had never forsaken him -- even his unrequited love . He laid it on the altar of his God , to bloom afresh , a beauteous flower transplanted by the River of Life , beyond the blight of envy and of care -- beyond , yet near enough to earth to scatter its fragrance in blessings down upon the head of her whom he -- loved ! Dare he say that word ? Yes , in a sweeter , holier sense than before , as one might love the beings of another world . His face was quite calm as he turned on the light to resume his studies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Yes , he had spent pleasant hours there , but he must leave , now . It was better that the same roof should not shelter them both . He did not wish to see Beth Woodburn again ; and he just remembered that a friend of his was going to vacate a room on the other side of the park . He would take it early next week . It was a week later , one afternoon , just before tea , that Beth and Mabel Clayton were sitting in the drawing-room with Mrs. Owen . " Do you know any of the girls over at the college who would like to get a room , Miss Clayton ? " " No , but I might find some one . " " Mr. Grafton has moved out of his room for some reason , I do n't know what . " " Mr. -- whom did you say ? " asked Beth . " Mr. Grafton . Did you know him ? A tall , dark fellow ! Goes to Victoria . Quite good-looking ! " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just who it is ! Why , how funny we never met each other coming in and out ! " " Did you know him , Beth ? " asked Mabel . " I met him once or twice in the halls , but I did n't know you knew him . " " Yes , I have known him ever since we were children . " " Oh , then you have heard him play , " said Mrs. Owens . " He played for us Thanksgiving eve . He 's a splendid musician . " Beth felt just a tinge of disappointment that night as she passed the closed door of the room Arthur had occupied . She wondered why he never tried to find her . It was unkind of him to break the old friendship so coldly . It was not her fault she could not love him , she thought . She could never , never do that ! In fact , she did not believe she would ever love any man . " Some people are not made for marriage , and I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell asleep . CHAPTER X. DEATH . Christmas eve , and Beth was home for her two weeks ' holidays . It was just after tea , and she and her father thought the parlor decidedly cosy , with the curtains drawn and the candles flaming among the holly over the mantel-piece . It seemed all the cosier because of the storm that raged without . The sleet was beating against the pane , and the wind came howling across the fields . Beth parted the curtains once , and peeped out at the snow-wreaths whirling and circling round . " Dear ! such a storm ! I am glad you 're not out to-night , daddy . " Beth came back to the fire-side , and passed her father a plate of fruit-cake she had made herself . " It 's too fresh to be good , but you must n't find any fault . Just eat every bit of it down . Oh , Kitty , stop ! " They had been cracking walnuts on the hearth-rug , and Beth 's pet kitten was amusing itself by scattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footstool at her father 's feet . " You look well after your fall 's work , Beth ; hard study does n't seem to hurt you . " " I believe it agrees with me , father . " " Did you see much of Arthur while you were in Toronto , Beth ? I was hoping you would bring him home for the Christmas holidays . " " No , I never saw him once . " " Never saw him once ! " He looked at her a little sternly . " Beth , what is the matter between you and Arthur ? " Ding ! The old door-bell sounded . Beth drooped her head , but the bell had attracted her father 's attention , and Aunt Prudence thrust her head into the parlor in her unceremonious way . " Doctor , that Brown fellow , by the mill , is wuss , an ' his wife 's took down , too . They think he 's dyin ' . " " Oh , daddy , I ca n't let you go out into this dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsense , child ! I must go . It 's a matter of life and death , perhaps . Help me on with my coat , daughter , please , I 've been out in worse storms than this . " Beth thought her father looked so brave and noble in that big otter overcoat , and his long white beard flowing down . She opened the door for him , and the hall light shone out into the snow . She shuddered as she saw him staggering in the wind and sleet , then went back into the parlor . It seemed lonely there , and she went on to the kitchen , where Aunt Prudence was elbow-deep in pastry . A kitchen is always a cheerful place at Christmas time . Beth 's fears seemed quieted , and she went back to the parlor to fix another branch of holly about a picture . Ding ! Was any one else sick , she wondered , as she went to answer the bell . She opened the door , and there stood Mrs. Perth ! It was really she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , May , dear ! What are you doing out in this storm ? " " Oh , I 'm nearly half dead , Beth . " She tried to laugh , but the attempt was not exactly a success . Beth took her in to the fire , removed her wraps , all matted with snow , and called to Aunt Prudence for some hot tea . " Is your father out to-night , Beth ? " asked May . " Yes , he went away out to the Browns ' . But wherever have you been ? " " I 've been taking some Christmas things to a poor family about two miles out in the country , and I did n't think the storm so very bad when I started ; but I 'm like the Irishman with his children , I 've ' more'n I want '  - -  of sleet , at any rate . Walter is away to-night , you know . " " Mr. Perth away ! Where ? " " Oh , he went to Simcoe . He has two weddings . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse . But it 's mean , though , " she continued , with a sweet , affected little pout ; " he 'll not get back till afternoon , and it 's Christmas , too . " " Oh , May dear , you 'll just stay right here with us to-night , and for dinner to-morrow . Is n't that just fine ! " Beth was dancing around her in child-like glee . Mrs. Perth accepted , smiling at her pleasure ; and they sat on the couch , chatting . " Did you say Dr. Woodburn had gone to the Browns ' . " " Yes , Mrs. Brown is sick , too . " " Oh , is n't it dreadful ? They 're so poor , too . I do n't believe they 've a decent bed in the house . " " Eight ! There , the clock just struck . Father ought to be back . It was only a little after six when he went out . " She looked anxiously at the drawn curtains , but the sleet beating harder and harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is now ! " she cried , as a step entered the hall , and she rushed to meet him . " Oh , daddy , dear -- why , father ! " Her voice changed to wonder and fear . His overcoat was gone and he seemed a mass of ice and snow . His beard was frozen together ; his breath came with a thick , husky , sound , and he looked so pale and exhausted . She led him to the fire , and began removing his icy garments . She was too frightened to be of much use , but May 's thoughtful self was flitting quietly around , preparing a hot drink and seeing that the bed was ready . He could not speak for a few minutes , and then it was only brokenly . " Poor creatures ! She had nothing over her but a thin quilt , and the snow blowing through the cracks ; and I just took off my coat -- and put it over her . I thought I could stand it . " Beth understood it now . He had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after taking off his warm fur overcoat , and he was just recovering from a severe cough , too . She trembled for its effect upon him . It went to her heart to hear his husky breathing as he sat there trembling before the fire . They got him to bed soon , and Aunt Prudence tramped through the storm for Dr. Mackay , the young doctor who had started up on the other side of the town . He came at once , and looked grave after he had made a careful examination . There had been some trouble with the heart setting in , and the excitement of his adventure in the storm had aggravated it . Beth remembered his having trouble of that sort once before , and she thought she read danger in Dr. Mackay 's face . That was a long , strange night to Beth as she sat there alone by her father 's bedside . He did not sleep , his breathing seemed so difficult . She had never seen him look like that before -- so weak and helpless , his silvery hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not with health . He said nothing , but he looked at her with a pitying look sometimes . What did it all mean ? Where would it end ? She gave him his medicine from hour to hour . The sleet beat on the window and the heavy ticking of the clock in the intervals of the storm sounded like approaching footsteps . The wind roared , and the old shutter creaked uneasily . The husky breathing continued by her side and the hours grew longer . Oh , for the morning ! What would the morrow bring ? She had promised May to awaken her at three o'clock , but she looked so serene sleeping with a smile on her lips , that Beth only kissed her softly and went back to her place . Her father had fallen asleep , and it was an hour later that she heard a gentle step beside her , and May looked at her reproachfully . She went to her room and left May to watch . There was a box on her table that her father had left before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Christmas morning . Christmas morning ! There was a handsome leather-bound Bible and a gold watch with a tiny diamond set in the back . She had a choked feeling as she lay down , but she was so exhausted she soon slept . It was late in the morning when she awoke , and May did not tell her of her father 's fainting spell . Aunt Prudence was to sit up that night . The dear old housekeeper ! How kind she was , Beth thought . She had often been amused at the quaint , old-fashioned creature . But she was a kind old soul , in spite of her occasional sharp words . Dr. Woodburn continued about the same all the following day , saving that he slept more . The next day was Sunday , and Beth slept a little in the afternoon . When she awakened she heard Dr. Mackay going down the hall , and May came in to take her in her arms and kiss her . She sat down on the bed beside Beth , with tears in her beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good man . He has done so much ! If God should call him home to his reward , would you -- would you refuse to give him up ? " Beth laid her head on May 's shoulder , sobbing . " Oh , May -- is it -- death ? " she asked , in a hoarse whisper . " I fear so , dear . " Beth wept long , and May let her grief have its way for a while , then drew her nearer to her heart . " If Jesus comes for him , will you say ' no ' ? " " His will be done , " she answered , when she grew calmer . The next day lawyer Graham came and stayed with Dr. Woodburn some time , and Beth knew that all hope was past , but she wore a cheerful smile in her father 's presence during the few days that followed -- bright winter days , with sunshine and deep snow . The jingle of sleigh-bells and the sound of merry voices passed in the street below as she listened to the labored breathing at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he raised his hand and smoothed her hair in his old-time way . " Beth , I am going home . You have been a good daughter -- my one great joy . God bless you , my child . " He paused a moment . " You will have to teach , and I think you had better go back to college soon . You 'll not miss me so much when you 're working . " Beth pressed back her tears as she kissed him silently , and he soon fell asleep . She went to the window and looked out on it all -- the clear , cold night sky with its myriads of stars , the brightly lighted windows and the snow-covered roofs of the town on the hill-slope , and the Erie , a frozen line of ice in the distant moonlight . The town seemed unusually bright with lights , for it was the gay season of the year . And , oh , if she but dared to give vent to that sob rising in her throat ! She turned to the sleeper again ; a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the everlasting arms , " he whispered faintly , then pointed to a picture of Arthur on the table . Beth brought it to him . He looked at it tenderly , then gave it back to her . He tried to say something , and she bent over him to catch the words , but all was silent there ; his eyes were closed , his lips set in a smile . Her head sank upon his breast . " Papa ! " she cried . No answer , not even the sound of heartbeats . There was a noiseless step at her side , and she fell back , unconscious , into May 's arms . When she came to again she was in her own room , and Mr. Perth was by her side . Then the sense of her loss swept over her , and he let her grief have its way for a while . " My child , " he said at last , bending over her . How those two words soothed her ! He talked to her tenderly for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . But the strain had been too much for her , and she was quite ill all the next day . She lay listening to the strange footsteps coming and going in the halls , for everyone came to take a last look at one whom all loved and honored . There was the old woman whom he had helped and encouraged , hobbling on her cane to give him a last look and blessing ; there was the poor man whose children he had attended free of charge , the hand of whose dying boy he had held ; there was the little ragged girl , who looked up through her tears and said , " He was good to me . " Then came the saddest moment Beth had ever known , when they led her down for the last time to his side . She scarcely saw the crowded room , the flowers that were strewn everywhere . It was all over . The last words were said , and they led her out to the carriage . The sun was low in the west that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parsonage , " as she always said after that . Aunt Prudence came to bid her good-bye before she went away to live with her married son , and Beth never realized before how much she loved the dear old creature who had watched over her from her childhood . Just once before she returned to college she went back to look at the old home , with its shutters closed and the snow-drifts on its walks . She had thought her future was to be spent there , and now where would her path be guided ? " Thou knowest , Lord , " she said faintly . CHAPTER XI . LOVE . In the soft flush of the following spring Beth returned to the parsonage at Briarsfield . It was so nice to see the open country again after the city streets . Mr. Perth met her at the station just as the sun was setting , and there was a curious smile on his face . He was a little silent on the way home , as if he had something on his mind ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the apple-blossoms , and Mrs. Perth came down the walk to meet them , looking so fair and smiling , and why -- she had something white in her arms ! Beth bounded forward to meet her . " Why , May , where did you -- whose baby ? " asked Beth , breathless and smiling . " Who does she look like ? " The likeness to May Perth on the little one-month-old face was unmistakable . " You naughty puss , why did n't you tell me when you wrote ? " " Been keeping it to surprise you , " said Mr. Perth . " Handsome baby , is n't it ? Just like her mother ! " " What are you going to call her ? " " Beth . " And May kissed her fondly as she led her in . What a pleasant week that was ! Life may be somewhat desert-like , but there is many a sweet little oasis where we can rest in the shade by the rippling water , with the flowers and the birds about us . One afternoon Beth went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and past the old Mayfair home . The family were still in Europe , and the place , she heard , was to be sold . The afternoon sunshine was beating on the closed shutters , the grass was knee-deep on the lawn and terraces , and the weeds grew tall in the flower-beds . Deserted and silent ! Silent as that past she had buried in her soul . Silent as those first throbs of her child-heart that she had once fancied meant love . That evening she and May sat by the window watching the sunset cast its glories over the lake , a great sheet of flame , softened by a wrapping of thin purplish cloud , like some lives , struggling , fiery , triumphant , but half hidden by this hazy veil of mortality . " Are you going to write another story , Beth ? " " Yes , I thought one out last fall . I shall write it as soon as I am rested . " " What is it -- a love story ? " " Yes , it 's natural to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . " May laughed softly . " Do you know , I am beginning to long to love truly . I want to taste the deep of life , even if it brings me pain . " It was a momentary restlessness , and she recalled these words before long . Mr. Perth joined them just then . He was going away for a week 's holiday on the following day . " I suppose you have a supply for Sunday , " said Mrs. Perth . " Yes , I have . I think he 'll be a very good one . He 's a volunteer missionary . " " Where is he going ? " asked Beth . " I do n't know . " " I should like to meet him , " and Beth paused before she continued , in a quiet tone , " I am going to be a missionary myself . " " Beth ! " exclaimed Mrs. Perth . " I thought you were planning this , " said Mr. Perth . " Thought so ? How could you tell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind . You are easily read . Where are you going ? " " I have n't decided yet . I only just decided to go lately -- one Sunday afternoon this spring . I used to hate the idea . " Perhaps it was this little talk that made her think of Arthur again that night . Why had he never sent her one line , one word of sympathy in her sorrow ? He was very unkind , when her father had loved him so . Was that what love meant ? The supply did not stay at the parsonage , and Beth did not even ask his name , as she supposed it would be unfamiliar to her . The old church seemed so home-like that Sunday . The first sacred notes echoed softly down the aisles ; the choir took their places ; then there was a moment 's solemn hush ,  - -  and Arthur ! Why , that was Arthur going up into the pulpit ! She could hardly repress a cry of surprise . For the moment she forgot all her coldness and indifference , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a trifle paler , but there was a delicate fineness about him she had never seen before , particularly in his eyes , a mystery of pain and sweetness , blended and ripened into a more perfect manhood . Was it because Arthur preached that sermon she thought it so grand ? No , everybody seemed touched . And this was the small boy who had gone hazel-nutting with her , who had heard her geography , and , barefoot , carried her through the brook . But that was long , long ago . They had changed since then . Before she realized it , the service was over , and the people were streaming through the door-way where Arthur stood shaking hands with the acquaintances of his childhood . There was a soothed , calm expression on Beth 's brow , and her eyes met Arthur 's as he touched her hand . May thought she seemed a trifle subdued that day , especially toward evening . Beth had a sort of feeling that night that she would have been content to sit there at the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white lilies about the altar , a sprinkling of early stars in the evening sky ; solemn hush and sacred music within , and the cry of some stray night-bird without . There were gems of poetry in that sermon , too ; little gleanings from nature here and there . Then she remembered how she had once said Arthur had not an artist-soul . Was she mistaken ? Was he one of those men who bury their sentiments under the practical duties of every-day life ? Perhaps so . The next day she and May sat talking on the sofa by the window . " Do n't you think , May , I should make a mistake if I married a man who had no taste for literature and art ? " " Yes , I do . I believe in the old German proverb , ' Let like and like mate together . ' " Was that a shadow crossed Beth 's face ? " But , whatever you do , Beth , do n't marry a man who is all moonshine . A man may be literary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I think the greatest genius is sometimes silent ; but , even when silent , he inspires others to climb the heights that duty forbade him to climb himself . " " You 've deep thoughts in your little head , May . " And Beth bent over , in lover-like fashion , to kiss the little white hand , but May had dropped into one of her light-hearted , baby moods , and playfully withdrew it . " Do n't go mooning like that , kissing my dirty little hands ! One would think you had been falling in love . " Beth went for another stroll that evening . She walked past the dear old house on the hill-top . The shutters were no longer closed ; last summer 's flowers were blooming again by the pathway ; strange children stopped their play to look at her as she passed , and there were sounds of mirth and music within . Yes , that was the old home -- home no longer now ! There was her own old window , the white roses drooping about it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down on your little Beth ! " These words were in her eyes as she lifted them to the evening sky , her tears falling silently . She was following the old path by the road-side , where she used to go for the milk every evening , when a firm step startled her . " Arthur ! Good evening . I 'm so glad to see you again ! " She looked beautiful for a moment , with the tears hanging from her lashes , and the smile on her face . " I called to see you at the parsonage , but you were just going up the street , so I thought I might be pardoned for coming too . " They were silent for a few moments . It was so like old times to be walking there together . The early stars shone faintly ; but the clouds were still pink in the west ; not a leaf stirred , not a breath ; no sound save a night-bird calling to its mate in the pine-wood yonder , and the bleat of lambs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender words of sorrow for her loss . " I should have written to you if I had known , but I was sick in the hospital , and I didn't --  " " Sick in the hospital ! Why , Arthur , have you been ill ? What was the matter ? " " A light typhoid fever . I went to the Wesleyan College , at Montreal , after that , so I did n't even know you had come back to college . " " To the Wesleyan ? I thought you were so attached to Victoria ! Whatever made you leave it , Arthur ? " He flushed slightly , and evaded her question . " Do you know , it was so funny , Arthur , you roomed in the very house where I boarded last fall , and I never knew a thing about it till afterward ? Was n't it odd we did n't meet ? " Again he made some evasive reply , and she had an odd sensation , as of something cold passing between them . He suddenly became formal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit fishing , and where Beth never caught anything ( just like a girl ) ; they always went to Arthur 's hook . The two forgot their coldness as they walked back , and Beth was disappointed that Arthur had an engagement and could not come in . They lingered a moment at the gate as he bade her good-night . A delicate thrill , a something sweet and new and strange , possessed her as he pressed her hand ! Their eyes met for a moment . " Good-bye for to-night , Beth . " May was singing a soft lullaby as she came up the walk . Only a moment ! Yet what a revelation a moment may bring to these hearts of ours ! A look , a touch , and something live is throbbing within ! We can not speak it . We dare not name it . For , oh , hush , ' t is a sacred hour in a woman 's life . Beth went straight to her room , and sat by the open window in the star-light . Some boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street below ; the moon was rising silvery above the blue Erie ; the white petals of apple-blossoms floated downward in the night air , and in it all she saw but one face -- a face with great , dark , tender eyes , that soothed her with their silence . Soothed ? Ah , yes ! She felt like a babe to-night , cradled in the arms of something , she knew not what -- something holy , eternal and calm . And this was love . She had craved it often -- wondered how it would come to her -- and it was just Arthur , after all , her childhood 's friend , Arthur -- but yet how changed ! He was not the same . She felt it dimly . The Arthur of her girlhood was gone . They were man and woman now . She had not known this Arthur as he was now . A veil seemed to have been suddenly drawn from his face , and she saw in him -- her ideal . There were tears in her eyes as she gazed heavenward . She had thought to journey to heathen lands alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur -- Arthur ! " she called in a soft , sweet whisper as she drooped her smiling face . What mattered all her blind shilly-shally fancies about his nature not being poetic ? There was more poetry buried in that heart of his than she had ever dreamed . " I can never , never marry Arthur ! " she had often told herself . She laughed now as she thought of it , and it was late before she slept , for she seemed to see those eyes looking at her in the darkness -- so familiar , yet so new and changed ! She awoke for a moment in the grey light just before dawn , and she could see him still ; her hand yet thrilled from his touch . She heard the hoarse whistle of a steamer on the lake ; the rooks were cawing in the elm-tree over the roof , and she fell asleep again . " Good-morning , Rip Van Winkle , " said May , when she entered the breakfast-room . " Why , is that clock -- just look at the time ! I forgot to wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintest idea what time it was when I got up this morning ! " " Good-bye for to-night , Beth , " he had said , and he was going away to-morrow morning , so he would surely come to-day . No wonder she went about with an absent smile on her face , and did everything in the craziest possible way . It was so precious , this newly-found secret of hers ! She knew her own heart now . There was no possibility of her misunderstanding herself in the future . The afternoon was wearing away , and she sat waiting and listening . Ding ! No , that was only a beggar-woman at the door . Ding , again ! Yes , that was Arthur ! Then she grew frightened . How could she look into his eyes ? He would read her secret there . He sat down before her , and a formal coldness seemed to paralyze them both . " I have come to bid you good-bye , Miss Woodburn ! " Miss Woodburn ! He had never called her that before . How cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to Victoria College ? " she asked . " No , to the Wesleyan . Are you going to spend your summer in Briarsfield ? " " Most of it . I am going back to Toronto for a week or two before ' Varsity opens . My friend Miss de Vere is staying with some friends there . She is ill and --  " " Do you still call her your friend ? " he interrupted , with a sarcastic smile . " Why , yes ! " she answered wonderingly , never dreaming that he had witnessed that same scene in the Mayfair home . " You are faithful , Beth , " he said , looking graver . Then he talked steadily of things in which neither of them had any interest . How cold and unnatural it all was ! Beth longed to give way to tears . In a few minutes he rose to go . He was going ! Arthur was going ! She dared not look into his face as he touched her hand coldly . " Good-bye , Miss Woodburn . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the parlor and watched him -- under the apple trees , white with blossom , through the gate , past the old church , around the corner -- he was gone ! The clock ticked away in the long , silent parlor ; the sunshine slept on the grass outside ; the butterflies were flitting from flower to flower , and laughing voices passed in the street , but her heart was strangely still . A numb , voiceless pain ! What did it mean ? Had Arthur changed ? Once he had loved her . " God have pity ! " her white lips murmured . And yet that look , that touch last night -- what did it mean ? What folly after all ! A touch , a smile , and she had woven her fond hopes together . Foolish woman-heart , building her palace on the sands for next day 's tide to sweep away ! Yet how happy she had been last night ! A thrill , a throb , a dream of bliss ; crushed now , all but the memory ! The years might bury it all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had laid her plans for life , sweet , unselfish plans for uplifting human lives . Strange lands , strange scenes , strange faces would surround her . She would toil and smile on others , " but oh , Arthur , Arthur --  " All through the long hours of that night she lay watching ; she could not sleep . Arthur was still near , the same hills surrounding them both . The stars were shining and the hoarse whistle of the steamers rent the night . Perhaps they would never be so near again . Would they ever meet , she wondered . Perhaps not ! Another year , and he would be gone far across the seas , and then , " Good-bye , Arthur ! Good-bye ! God be with you ! " CHAPTER XII . FAREWELL . Beth 's summer at Briarsfield parsonage passed quietly and sweetly . She had seemed a little sad at first , and May , with her woman 's instinct , read more of her story than she thought , but she said nothing , though she doubled her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing sweet . But let us look at Beth as she sits in the shadow of the trees in the parsonage garden . It was late in August , and Beth was waiting for May to come out . Do you remember the first time we saw her in the shadow of the trees on the lawn at home ? It is only a little over two years ago , but yet how much she has changed ! You would hardly recognize the immature girl in that gentle , sweet-faced lady in her dark mourning dress . The old gloom had drifted from her brow , and in its place was sunlight , not the sunlight of one who had never known suffering , but the gentler , sweeter light of one who had triumphed over it . It was a face that would have attracted you , that would have attracted everyone , in fact , from the black-gowned college professor to the small urchin shouting in the street . To the rejoicing it said , " Let me laugh with you , for life is sweet ; " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . I know what you feel . " Just then her sweet eyes were raised to heaven in holy thought , " Dear heavenly Father , thou knowest everything -- how I loved him . Thy will be done . Oh , Jesus , my tender One , thou art so sweet ! Thou dost understand my woman 's heart and satisfy even its sweet longings . Resting in Thy sweet presence what matter life 's sorrows ! " She did not notice the lattice gate open and a slender , fair-haired man pause just inside to watch her . It was Clarence Mayfair . There was a touching expression on his face as he looked at her . Yes , she was beautiful , he thought . It was not a dream , the face that he had carried in his soul since that Sunday night last fall . Beth Woodburn was beautiful . She was a woman now . She was only a child when they played their little drama of love there in Briarsfield . The play was past now ; he loved her as a man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face -- perhaps it was too late ! " Clarence ! " exclaimed Beth , as he advanced , " I 'm glad to see you . " And she held out her hand with an air of graceful dignity . " You have come back to visit Briarsfield , I suppose . I was so surprised to see you , " she continued . " Yes , I am staying at Mr. Graham 's . " She noticed as he talked that he looked healthier , stronger and more manly . Altogether she thought him improved . " Your father and mother are still in England , I suppose , " said she . " Yes , they intend to stay with their relatives this winter . As for me , I shall go back to ' Varsity and finish my course . " " Oh , are you going to teach ? " " Yes ; there 's nothing else before me , " he answered , in a discouraged tone . She understood . She had heard of his father 's losses , and , what grieved her still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary failure . He had talent , but he had not the fresh , original genius that this age of competition demands . Poor Clarence ! She was sorry for him . " You have been all summer in Briarsfield ? " he asked . " Yes , but I am going to Toronto to-morrow morning . " " Yes , I know . Miss de Vere told me she had sent for you . " " Oh , you have seen her then ! " " Yes , I saw her yesterday . Poor girl , she 'll not last long . Consumption has killed all the family . " Beth wondered if he loved Marie , and she looked at him , with her gentle , sympathetic eyes . He caught her look and winced under it . She gazed away at the glimpse of lake between the village roofs for a moment . " Beth , have you forgotten the past ? " he asked , in a voice abrupt but gentle . She started . She had never seen his face look so expressive . The tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , I have not forgotten . " " Beth , I did not love you then ; I did not know what love meant --  " " Oh , do n't speak of it ! It would have been a terrible mistake ! " " But , Beth , can you never forgive the past ? I love you now -- I have loved you since --  " " Oh , hush , Clarence ! You must not speak of love ! " And she buried her face in her hands and sobbed a moment , then leaned forward slightly toward him , a tender look in her eyes . " I love another , " she said , in a low gentle voice . He shielded his eyes for a moment with his fair delicate hand . It was a hard moment for them both . " I am so sorry , Clarence . I know what you feel . I am sorry we ever met . " He looked at her with a smile on his saddened face . " I feared it was so ; but I had rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other woman . Good-bye , Beth . " " Good-bye . " He lingered a moment as he touched her hand in farewell . " God bless you , " she said , softly . He crossed the garden in the sunshine , and she sat watching the fleecy clouds and snatches of lake between the roofs . Poor Clarence ! Did love mean to him what it meant to her ? Ah , yes ! she had seen the pain written on his brow . Poor Clarence ! That night she craved a blessing upon him as she knelt beside her bed . Just then he was wandering about the weed-grown lawns of his father 's house , which looked more desolate than ever in the light of the full moon . It was to be sold the following spring , and he sighed as he walked on toward the lake-side . Right there on that little cliff he had asked Beth Woodburn to be his wife , and but for that fickle faithlessness of his , who knew what might have been ? And yet it was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her drew him heavenward that night . The next day Beth was on her way to Toronto to see Marie . She was in a pensive mood as she sat by the car window , gazing at the farm-lands stretching far away , and the wooded hill-sides checkered by the sunlight shining through their boughs . There is always a pleasant diversion in a few hours ' travel , and Beth found herself drawn from her thoughts by the antics of a negro family at the other end of the car . A portly colored woman presided over them ; she had " leben chilen , four dead and gone to glory , " as she explained to everyone who questioned her . It was about two o'clock when Beth reached Toronto , and the whirr of electric cars , the rattle of cabs and the mixed noises of the city street would all have been pleasantly exciting to her young nerves but for her thoughts of Marie . She wondered at her coming to the city to spend her last days , but it was quiet on Grenville Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beth was , indeed , struck by the change in her friend when she entered the room . She lay there so frail and shadow-like among her pillows , her dark cheeks sunken , though flushed ; but her eyes had still their old brilliancy , and there was an indefinable gentleness about her . Beth seemed almost to feel it as she stooped to kiss her . The Bartrams were very considerate , and left them alone together as much as possible , but Marie was not in a talking mood that day . Her breath came with difficulty , and she seemed content to hold Beth 's hand and smile upon her , sometimes through tears that gathered silently . Bright , sparkling Marie ! They had not been wont to associate tears with her in the past . It was a pleasant room she had , suggestive of her taste -- soft carpet and brightly-cushioned chairs , a tall mirror reflecting the lilies on the stand , and a glimpse of Queen 's Park through the open window . The next day was Sunday , and Beth sat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly to the bells peal forth their morning call together , and Beth noted with pleasure that it seemed to soothe Marie as she lay with closed eyes and a half smile on her lips . " Beth , you have been so much to me this summer . Your letters were so sweet . You are a great , grand woman , Beth . " And she stroked Beth 's hair softly with her frail , wasted hand . " Do you remember when I used to pride myself on my unbelief ? " Her breath failed her for a moment . " It is past now , " she continued , with a smile . " It was one Sunday ; I had just read one of your letters , and I felt somehow that Jesus had touched me . I am ready now . It was hard , so hard at first , to give up life , but I have learned at last to say ' His will be done . ' " Beth could not speak for the sob she had checked in her throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to talk to you , dear . You remember the old days when that trouble came between you and -- and Clarence . I was a treacherous friend to you , Beth , to ever let him speak of love to me . I was a traitor to --  " " Oh , hush ! Marie , darling , do n't talk so , " Beth pleaded in a sobbing tone . " I must speak of it , Beth . I was treacherous to you . But when you know what I suffered --  " Her breath failed again for a moment . " I loved him , Beth , " she whispered . " Marie ! " There was silence for a moment , broken only by Marie 's labored breathing . " I loved him , but I knew he did not love me . It was only a fancy of his . I had charmed him for the time , but I knew when I was gone his heart would go back to you -- and now , Beth , I am dying slowly , I ask but one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forgotten now ; let me see you happy together just as it was before . " " Oh , hush , Marie ! It can not be . It can never be . You know I told you last fall that I did not love him . " " Ah , but that is your pride , Beth ; all your pride ! Listen to me , Beth . If I had ten years more to live , I would give them all to see you both happy and united . " Beth covered her face with her hands , as her tears flowed silently . " Marie , I must tell you all , " she said , as she bent over her . " I love another : I love Arthur ! " " Arthur Grafton ! " Marie exclaimed , and her breath came in quick , short gasps , and there was a pained look about her closed eyes . Beth understood she was grieved for the disappointment of the man she loved . " And you , Beth -- are you happy ? Does he -- Arthur , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . He loved me once , the summer before I came to college , but he is changed now . He was in Briarsfield this summer for a few days , but I saw he was changed . He was not like the same Arthur -- so changed and cold . " She sat with a grave look in her grey eyes as Marie lay watching her . " Only once I thought he loved me , " she continued ; " one night when he looked at me and touched my hand . But the next day he was cold again , and I knew then that he did n't love me any more . " Marie lay for a few moments with a very thoughtful look in her eyes , but she made no remark , and , after a while , she slept from weakness and exhaustion . Beth went out for a few hours next morning , and found her very much weaker when she returned . Mrs. Bartram said she had tired herself writing a letter . She had a wide-awake air as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch every step on the stair-way . It was toward the close of day . " Hark ! who 's that ? " she asked , starting . " Only Mrs. Bartram . Rest , dearest , " said Beth . But the brilliant eyes were fixed on the door , and a moment later Clarence entered the room . Marie still held Beth 's hand , but her dark eyes were fixed on Clarence with a look never to be forgotten . " You have come at last , " she said , then fell back on her pillows exhausted , but smiling , her eyes closed . He stood holding the frail hand she had stretched out to him , then the dark eyes opened slowly , and she gazed on him with a yearning look . " Put your hand upon my forehead , I shall die happier , " she said , softly . " Oh , Clarence , I loved you ! I loved you ! It can do no harm to tell you now . Kiss me just once . In a moment I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , and left her alone with the man she loved ; but in a few minutes he called her and Mrs. Bartram to the bed-side . Marie was almost past speaking , but she stretched forth her arms to Beth and drew her young head down upon her breast . There was silence for a few minutes , broken only by Marie 's hoarse breathing . " Jesus , my Redeemer , " her pale lips murmured faintly , then the heart-throbs beneath Beth 's ear were still ; the slender hand fell helpless on the counterpane ; the brilliant eyes were closed ; Marie was gone ! When Beth came to look at her again she lay smiling in her white , flowing garment , a single lily in her clasped hands . Poor Marie ! She had loved and suffered , and now it was ended . Aye , but she had done more than suffer . She had refused the man she loved for his sake and for the sake of another . Her sacrifice had been in vain , but the love that sacrificed itself -- was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie ! Her friends thought it a strange request of hers to be buried at Briarsfield , but it was granted . Her vast wealth -- as she had died childless -- went , by the provisions of her father 's will , to a distant cousin , but her jewels she left to Beth . The following afternoon Mr. Perth read the funeral service , and they lowered the lovely burden in the shadow of the pines at the corner of the Briarsfield church-yard . There in that quiet village she had first seen him she loved . After all her gay social life she sought its quiet at last , and the stars of that summer night looked down on her new-made grave . The following day Mr. Perth laid a colored envelope from a large publishing firm in Beth 's lap . They had accepted her last story for a good round sum , accompanied by most flattering words of encouragement . As she read the commendatory words , she smiled at the thought of having at least one talent to use in her Master 's service . Yes , Beth Woodburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no vain dream of her childhood . Four weeks passed and Beth had finished her preparations for returning to college in the fall . In a few weeks she would be leaving May and the dear old parsonage , but she would be glad to be back at ' Varsity again . There came a day of heavy rain , and she went out on an errand of charity for May . When she returned , late in the afternoon , she heard Mr. Perth talking to someone in the study , but that was nothing unusual . The rain was just ceasing , and the sun suddenly broke through the clouds , filling all the west with glory . Beth went down into the garden to drink in the beauty . Rugged clouds stood out like hills of fire fringed with gold , and the great sea of purple and crimson overhead died away in the soft flush of the east , while the wet foliage of the trees and gardens shone like gold beneath the clouds . It was glorious ! She had never seen anything like it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the sunset like a gateway into the beyond , and within all looked peaceful and golden . Somehow it made her think of Marie . Poor Marie ! Why had Clarence 's love for her been unreal ? Why could she not have lived and they been happy together ? Love and suffering ! And what had love brought to her ? Only pain . She thought of Arthur , too . Perhaps he was happiest of all . He seemed to have forgotten . But she -- ah , she could never forget ! Yet , " Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in Thy sight . " And she pulled a bunch of fall flowers from the bush at her side , careless of the rain-drops that shook on her bare head as she touched the branches . She did not know that she was being observed from the study window . " She is going to be a missionary , is n't she ? " said the stranger who was talking to Mr. Perth . " Yes ; she has n't decided her field yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes . She 's a noble girl ; I honor her . " " Yes , she is very noble , " said the stranger slowly , as he looked at her . She would have recognized his voice if she had been within hearing , but she only pulled another spray of blossoms , without heeding the sound of the study door shutting and a step approaching her on the gravelled walk . " Beth . " " Arthur ! Why , I -- I thought you were in Montreal ! " " So , I was . I just got there a few days ago , but I turned around and came back to-day to scold you for getting your feet wet standing there in the wet grass . I knew you did n't know how to take care of yourself . " There was a mischievous twinkle in his eyes . " Did n't I always take care of you when you were little ? " " Yes , and a nice tyrant you were ! " she said , laughing , when she had recovered from her surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed inclined to talk lightly at first , and then grew suddenly silent as they went into the drawing-room . Beth felt as though he were regarding her with a sort of protecting air . What did it mean ? What had brought him here so suddenly ? She was growing embarrassed at his silence , when she suddenly plunged into conversation about Montreal , the Wesleyan College , and other topics that were farthest away from her present thought and interest . " Beth , " said Arthur suddenly , interrupting the flow of her remarks in a gentle tone , " Beth , why did you not tell me last summer that you were going to be a missionary ? " She seemed startled for a moment , as he looked into her flushed face . " Oh , I do n't know . I -- I meant to . I meant to tell you that afternoon you came here before you went away , but I did n't know you were going so soon , and I did n't tell you somehow . Who told you ? " " Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She wrote to me just a few hours before she died ; but I did n't get the letter till yesterday . She left it with Clarence , and he could n't find me at first . " They looked at each other a moment in silence , and there was a tender smile in his eyes . Then a sudden flush crimsoned her cheek . How much did he know ? Had Marie told him that she --  " Beth , why did you not tell me before that you were free -- that you were not another 's promised wife ? " His voice was gentle , very gentle . Her face drooped , and her hand trembled as it lay on her black dress . He rose and bent over her , his hand resting on her shoulder . His touch thrilled her , soothed her , but she dare not raise her eyes . " I -- I -- did n't know it mattered -- that ; you cared , " she stammered . " Did n't know I cared ! " he exclaimed ; then , in a softer tone , " Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I love you , Beth . Can you ever love me enough to be my wife ? " She could not speak , but in her upturned face he read her answer , and his lips touched her brow reverently . Closer , closer to his breast he drew her . Soul open to soul , heart beating against heart ! The old clock ticked in the stillness , and the crimson glow of the sunset was reflected on the parlor wall . Oh , what joy was this suddenly breaking through the clouds upon them ! Beth was the first to break the silence . " Oh , Arthur , I love you so ! I love you so ! " she said , twining her arms passionately about his neck , as her tears fell upon his breast . It was the long pent-up cry of her loving womanhood . " But Arthur , why were you so cold and strange that day we parted last summer ? " " I thought you were another 's intended wife . I tried to hide my love from you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , lingering look into each other 's eyes , and , with one thought , they knelt together beside the old couch and gave thanks to the all-loving Father who had guided their paths together . That night Beth lay listening as the autumn wind shook the elm-tree over the roof and drifted the clouds in dark masses across the starry sky . But the winds might rage without -- aye , the storms might beat down , if they would , what did it matter ? Arthur was near , and the Divine presence was bending over her with its shielding love . " Oh , God , Thou art good ! " She was happy -- oh , so happy ! And she fell asleep with a smile on her face . The autumn passed -- such a gloriously happy autumn -- and Christmas eve had come . The snow lay white and cold on the fields and hills about Briarsfield , but in the old church all was warmth and light . A group of villagers were gathered inside , most of them from curiosity , and before the altar Arthur and Beth were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there in her white bridal robes . The church was still , sacredly still , but for the sound of Mr. Perth 's earnest voice ; and in the rear of the crowd was one face , deadly pale , but calm . It was Clarence . How pure she looked , he thought . Pure as the lilies hanging in clusters above her head ! Was she of the earth -- clay , like these others about her ? The very tone of her voice seemed to have caught a note from above . No , he had never been worthy of her ! Weak , fickle , wave-tossed soul that he was ! A look of humiliation crossed his face , then a look of hope . If he had never been worthy of her hand he would be worthy at least to have loved her in vain . He would be what she would have had him be . It was over ; the last words were said ; the music broke forth , and the little gold band gleamed on Beth 's fair hand as it lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling and happy . Oh , joy ! joy everlasting ! joy linking earth to heaven ! They rested that night in Beth 's old room at the parsonage , and as the door closed behind them they knelt together -- man and wife . Sacred hour ! Out beneath the stars of that still Christmas eve was one who saw the light shine from their window as he passed and blessed them . He carried a bunch of lilies in his hand as he made his way to a long white mound in the church-yard . Poor Marie ! He stooped and laid them in the snow , the pure white snow -- pure as the dead whose grave it covered ! pure as the vows he had heard breathed that night ! * * * * * Seven years have passed , and Beth sits leaning back in a rocker by the window , in the soft bright moonlight of Palestine . And what have the years brought to Beth ? She is famous now . Her novels are among the most successful of the day . She has marked out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her stories have broadened the sympathies of her world of readers . But the years have brought her something besides literary fame and success in the mission-field . By her side is a little white cot , and a little rosy-cheeked boy lies asleep upon the pillow , one hand , thrown back over his dark curls -- her little Arthur . There is a step beside her , and her husband bends over her with a loving look . " It is seven years to-night since we were married , Beth . " There are tears in her smiling eyes as she looks up into his face . " And you have never regretted ? " he asks . " Oh , Arthur ! How could I ? " and she hides her face on his breast . " My wife ! my joy ! " he whispers , as he draws her closer . " Arthur , do you remember what a silly , silly girl I used to be when I thought you had not enough of the artist-soul to understand my nature ? And here , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never have succeeded as well as I have . " He only kisses her for reply , and they look out over the flat-roofed city in the moonlight . Peace ! peace ! sweet peace ! " Not as the world giveth , give I unto you . " And the stars are shining down upon them in their love . And so , dear Beth , farewell ! The evening shadows lengthen as I write , but there is another to whom we must bid farewell . It is Clarence . Father and mother are both dead , and in one of the quiet parts of Toronto he lives , unmarried , in his comfortable rooms . The years have brought him a greater measure of success than once he had hoped . The sorrow he has so bravely hidden has perhaps enabled him to touch some chord in the human hearts of his readers . At any rate , he has a good round income now . Edith 's children come often to twine their arms about his neck ; but there are other children who love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of the city there is many a bare , desolate home that he has cheered with warmth and comfort , many a humble fireside where the little ones listen for his step , many little hands and feet protected from the cold by his benefactions . But no matter how lowly the house , he always leaves behind some trace of his artistic nature -- a picture or a bunch of flowers , something suggestive of the beautiful , the ideal . Sometimes , when the little ones playing about him lisp their childish praises , a softness fills his eyes and he thinks of one who is far away . Blessed be her footsteps ! But he is not sad long . No , he is the genial , jolly bachelor , whom everybody loves , so unlike the Clarence of long ago ; and so farewell , brave heart -- fare thee well !
