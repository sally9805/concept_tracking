txt " Let us go into this campaign resolved that the battle shall be fought under the banner of partisan Republicanism and that the man whom we shall elevate to the high office of Mayo ; of the Greater New York shall be a tried and true Republican . If we can not succeed in that result , better to place in power a True Democrat , or even a true Tammany Hall man , than to elevate to this great position of power and authority a man of no party and a man who has no party back of him . " This statement was made by Edward Lauterbach , President of the Republican County Committee , at the April meeting of that body in the hall of the United Charities Building , Fourth Avenue and Twenty-second Street , last night . It was made in the course of a speech filled with sensational utterances . He had returned from Albany , where his hopes of defeating the Raines law amendments had been dashed . He declared absolute antagonism to anything but a straight Republican ticket this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Police bill , and he criticised the passage of the Raines amendments because they forced an issue into the campaign which would ecliple the money issue , on which he desires to fight the battle for Greater New York . The occasion of Mr. Lauterbach 's sensational speech was the presentation to him by the members of the County Committee of a testimonial commemorating his services to the party in 1895 and 1896 . This testimonial was a chest of bird 's eye maple , lined with red chamois , and containing a beautiful set of fiat silverware , including all articles for use upon the table and sideboard . The chest contained a tray and three drawers filled with the ware , the pattern of all the pieces being of the Louis XV . style . The cost was $2,000 . Mr. Quigg Started the Talk . The speech of presentation was made by Congressman Lemuel Ely Quigg , who is a candidate for the Republican nomination for Mayor of the Greater New York . Mr. Quigg is not a member of the County Committee , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accorded the privileges of the floor on motion of F. S. Gibbs , and took the platform apparently to make a political address . In concluding his speech , Mr. Quigg paid a very graceful tribute to Mr. Lauterbach , and finished by presenting the chest of silver , which is as big as a Saratoga trunk . There was a great dertionstration at this , and cries of " Bravo ! " One man cried out , " Hurrah for our next Mayor , Mr. Quigg ! " Mr. Lauterbaeles Thanks . Mr. Lauterbach began his speech by speaking of the loyal support he had from the members of the committee during the last two years , and saying that no such testimonial was needed to show his associates ' regard for him . I do not know , " he said . " that I am entitled to be the donee of this gift . Doubtless it has been in course of preparation for some time . Circumstances have changed lately , and perhaps you may not think me worthy of it now . Things have been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defense of his Metropolitan Police bill that failed even of presentation . He said that his object was to secure for the greater city a real bipartisan Police Board , that would have charge of the next election and that cculd see to it that the election , which would determine questions of such grave import to the people of the greater city , should be conducted honestly and fairly . He had nothing to say against the personnel of the present Police Board , but he would say that its composition was not of a kind to make it safe so that the election matters should be intrusted. to it . Proceeding , Mr. hunterbach said : " But the bill was condemned , and he who framed it was subjected to abuse and villification . Maybe I was remiss in my duty as a Republican . Was I ? " " No. " came the chorus from the crowd . The speaker insisted that the bill meant no infraction of home rule . " Home rule ! " said he , rather sarcastically . " Why , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants a new State made out of the Greater New York , and if you carry this kind of home rule idea out to its legitimate conclusion , he is not so far out of the way . But do Republicans want to go to that length ? " Republicanism Against Bryanism . " There were , of course , " he said , " some errors in the law that should have been corrected . But we are on the eve of a great election in Greater New York in which the legitimate issue is Republicanism against Bryanism . With that issue there would be no doubt of our triumphant success . Why , then , eclipse the real issues by a false issue ? Why bring up questions that are not important at this time ? But it was deemed wise that the other course should be pursued and that the risk should be taken of the presentation of this new issue . " Tnen he told at length how the constituency of every Republican Assemblyman in the city had jealously watched the course of each Assemblyman in Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the action of these Assemblymen should be understood , and for that reason he had gone to Albany and advised the city Republicans not to go into the caucus so that they might have the opportunity of offering amendments and explaining their position upon the floor . They had all followed his advice but one . " Had I a right to do this ? " asked Mr. Lauterbach . " Yes , yes , " came from all over the hall . " Do you still want me to accept this splendid testimonial ? " " It still goes , " said Mr. Gibbs , at which there was a great laugh . Then Mr. Lauterbach turned to the coming campaign . Some Looked . Astounded . " I realize , " he said , " that we have no mean task before us . " Then he made the statement which is given above and " brought down the house " with it . Here and there , however , there were men in the audience who looked astounded . Mr. Lauterbach said that if a Republican was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration if it was a good one , and should take the full blame for it if it is , a bad one . If the Republicans aided in electing a man who did not take office as a Republican , the party was held responsible for his administration . " Fusion can not secure control , " said the speaker . " Control of non-partisanship in municipalities is the control of selfishness . It is probably true that the doctrinaires in the Citizens ' Union draw more from Republicans than from Democrats , but temptations held out by them must be shunned . And when they are shunned it must be remembered that we will have to work harder and with all our zeal and earnestness . As a victory with fusion is useless , it is better that it should not be made . " Mr. Lauterbach then urged hard work on all Republicans , and closed by accepting the testimonial with appropriate words of thanks . A Managing Committee . The committee adopted the following : Resolved , That a committee of nine members be appointed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintend all matters pertaining to a proper representation of all Republicans interested in the coming convention to nominate the Mayor and other officers of the Greater New York ; that for such purpose said committee shall have power to confer with like committees from Kings , Queens , Richmond , and portions of Westchester Counties , and that such representation shall conform as far as may be practicable with the principle of representation as adopted by the Republicans in their last State Convention . Mr. Lauterbach said that he would appoint the committee in a day or two . An amendment to the Constitution which will allow office holders to become members of the Executive Committee was presented . It must lay over for a month . The President announced his standing committees for the year , and asked them to get to work at once . The Chairmen are as follows : Organization  --  Cornelius Van Cott ; Election Officers  --  Abraham Gruber ; Finance  --  Jeremiah Pangburn ; Appeals  --  John J. Collins ; Abuses and Grievances  --  Jefferson A. Simons ; Naturalization  --  James P. Kelker  --  Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
