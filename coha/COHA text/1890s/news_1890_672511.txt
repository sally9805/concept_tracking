Dr. Chapin , as a member of the Committee on Hygiene of the County Medical Society , spent several days investigating the sanitary condition of the primary departments of various 80110018 in this city . Ho found a bad state of affairs iu most of the school buildings visited , and the conclusions that he formed after his investigation was completed were not complimentary to the branch of the City Government that is responsible for the condition of the school buildings . He reports that he found the classrooms overcrowded , badly lighted , badly ventilated , and filled with foul odors . Following are condensed descriptions or what Dr. Chapin dis-covered : School 58 , Seventy-ninth Street , between Second and Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120 children of an average age of six years . They wore seated very closely together with no desks . The class rooms were small and crowded , and in most of them the air was heavy and close . Room 13 , containing 60 children , had one window and is so dark ' that gas has to be used most of the time . The conflicting gas and daylight is trying to the eyes . Four hundred fl.Ad forty children who reside in the neighborhood are awaiting admission to this overcrowded School . School 42 , Allen Street , near Canal , 1,500 children . There are thirteen classrooms , with only one window opening on outside air . The proximity of the eevated road required the front windows to be kept closed . There are no wardrobes , and the wraps must be thrown on the back seats . This makes the air foul , particularly in wet weather .

Iu two of the main rooms there were 188 very small children , with no desks and the benches too high , so that most of them were unable to touch the Boor with their feet . Light in two or the classrooms very bad . and ? trying to the eyes of the pupils . Two classrooms on the ground floor filled with girls , and both have a damp , musty smell . In the west wing of the building , oecupied by boys . the smell from the closets is distinctly noticed in all the classrooms . The teach . era say that some days this smell is all through the school Drainage from neighboring buildings flows into the school cellar . School 7.80 Chrystie Street , 1.100 children . This primary school is in three buildinga , one of which is an old rookery formerly a tenement , and another is part of an old factory in Hester Street . The whole establishment is a disgrace to any civilized community . The Children come from poor families and they are given the poorest and scantiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuffy classrooms were lighted by gas , which with the peer ventilation , made the atmosphere almost unbearable . Foul air from the boys ' closets ends access to the school room through open windows and passageways connecting the closets with the room above . Three back rooms on this floor have been condemned on account of the foul air and the general darkness , but the other rooms connecting with them and in substantially the same condition are crowded with children . Sohool 20 , 160 chrystie Street , 1,010 children . School rooms badly lighted and filled with bad odors from closets . Gas has to be used on cloudy days in most of the rooms , In six of the olassroonis the children are obliged to sit on their wraps both in dry and wet weather . The rooms are all overcrowded and 210 children were excluded from the school for want of room this Fall . Dr. Chapin also found that the amount of air space allowed to the pupils by the regulations of the School Department is as follows : In the three lower ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each pupil ; in the three higher grades of the primary departments , SO cable feet ; in the four lower grades of the grammar schools , 90 cubic feet , and in the four higher grades of the grammar schools , 100 cubic feet . In contrast to these figures is the Board of Health 's requirement that from 100 to 600 cubic feet of air space shall be allowed to each occupant of a tenement house , and that at least 400 cubes feet of air space shall be allowed to each lodger in a lodging house . Dr. Chaein 's report was concurred in by the entire Committee on Hygiene of the County Medical Sooiety , which is composed as follows : Dr. Simon Baruch , Dr. R. C. M. Page , Dr. Cyrus Edson , Dr. J.

Public baths were commended as an excellent medium for the practice of the principles of hygiene . It was suggested that an improved system of public baths be established and that the custom of taking frequent baths be developed and extended by legal regulation . The report thought well of the warm shower or rain bath , and suggested that such bathing facilities be attuned to public schools . There could ho no better way of expending public funds than in the prevention of disease by putting the faoillties for taking baths within the reach of every person .
