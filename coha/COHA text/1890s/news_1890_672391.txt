For ten years Mr. O'Brien has been in the habit of seeking seclusion occasionally at the seaside hostelry of his old . friend , Mr. Charles Bader , Sr. Two months ago , piqued by his loss of political prestige , and worn out by a disease which had fastened itself upon him , he went to his favorite resort . " Pm a believer in Coney Island air , " he said then , " and if anything can ours me it can . " He had also a professional and personal friend in the person of Dr. F. C. Demund of New-Utrecht and he decided to place himself in the hands of this physician and of his son , Dr. John Demund . Since this fatal attack began they have been his attending physicians , aided by the advice of his family physician , Dr. James Rorke of this city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liver troubles of their pasfienteonfronted them . The dangers from this were heightened by gastritis , which supervened and which , it became evident to the medical men on last Monday , could have no other than a fatal termination . His daughter , Mrs. Evangeline Bader , and his unmarried . daughter , Florette , besides his son-inlaw and his sons , Joseph and John L. , were in constant attendance upon him , and on that day they were advised that the end could not be far off . On Tuesday last Father Kearney , with his assistant , Dr. Hannigan , of the old cathedral in Mulberry Street , were summoned , and the viaticum and extreme unction , the last sacraments of the Catholic Church were administered to the then dying man in the presence of his family . Since then he has had only brief intervals of consciousness . There were few visitors to the death chamber at Coney bland yesterday , not that the man who had held the Republicans of the Eighth District in the hollow of hishand and had made hosts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had telegraphed that the body would be immediately removed to his late residence , 62 Rivington Street , and that there they would be given an opportunity of taking a farewell of their dead friend . Shortly after 4 o'clock the remains were brought to this city . Among those who visited Bader 's Hotel yesterday were John . E. Brodsky , who was the first to be advised of Mr. O'Brien 's death ; Commissioner Stryker Williamson of Gravesend , Supervisor John Y. Megan , en-Alderman Thomas Cleary , and Judge Richard Newton of Gravesend . A career of peculiar interest is closed by the death of John J. O'Brien . For a score of years and more he has been an interesting factor in the affairs of the Republican party . There is not a politician in the county who did not know O'Brien , either personally or by reputation . The man and his methods make a part of local political history . As a practical politician he Vas remarkable in a sphere that sometimes bad the boundaries of the Eighth Assembly District for its limitations and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Presidential and State elections . The time was , and . it is not so very long ago , when O'Brien was the head and front of the Republican machine in this city . He was a power in his way , and the power behind him then was Chester A. Arthur . For the last few years of his life he was an outcast from his party . He was discarded because his methods did not suit others in the machine . In his earlier years he began the building up of a personal following in the Eighth Assembly District . lie was a man who knew the secret of binding men of a lower order of mentality to him in a fashion that made them obedient to his every political dictation . His personal following in the Eighth District became the nucleus ' of his power . It was the basis of his political " pull , " as his " boys " in the Eighth would say . He had absolute control of his followers . John E. Brodsky , his chosen orator , made this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien organization would follow their leader even into the Democmtio Party . O'Brien 's ability to direct other politicians and the confidence the big men in his party once had in him grew from his natural ability as a politician , and made him the figure that he was in local polities , He was born in Booaevilt Street June 11 , 1842 . After receiving a public school education he went into the employ of A. T. Stewart in his wholesale department . Both Mr. Stewart and Judge Hilton took a fancy to young O'Brien , and his progress was rapid . He was , put in charge of the delivery departMent , a position of great responsibility . Ex-Senator James Daly and Thomas J. Creamer were also in Mr. Stewart 's employ then . When Thomas Murphy was made Collector of the Port he off O'Brien the post of private secretary , an much against Mr. Stewart 's wish O'Brien le the dry goods business and went into the Custom House . He had always been interested in the Republican polities of the Eighth District , but now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Custom House first brought him into prominence in the politics of the city , and he made the most of his opportunity . At that time John W. Farmer was the Republican leader in the Eighth . He ran for Sheriff in 1867 . He established a number of tree soup houses in the old Tenth Ward , and used . these as one way of winning votes . Despite the soup houses , however , Farmer was defeated , end soon afterward O'Brien , who was at the head of the young men who were dissatisfied . with Farmer 's Management of the machine , broke away from Farmer and captured the organization himself . The district was then centre ed by Tammany , wider the leadership of Judge Scott . Edward D. Gale was Scott 's uoeessor , and O'Brien and Gale once lived in adjoininghouses on Rivington Street . There is a tradition that many of the affairs of the district were settled over the back yard fence . O'Brien , as soon as he got into control began the work of swinging the district over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Republican Party in the Eighth in 1871 , when he elected Conreid Geib to the Assembly and George J. Kraus Assistant Alderman . From that time until a few months ago Mr. Kraus was one of O'Brien 's most active lieutenants , but after the last local election , in which O'Brien led his followers to defeat in a district citizens ' movement , Kraus went over to Tammany . After the election of 1871 O'Brien pushed along the work of making a Republican stronghold , and when his followers and admirers comment on how well he succeeded they point out that although in 1876 Tilden 's majority was about 3,200 , Haneock 's majority in 1880 was only 154 , and in 1884 the di trict went Republican on the Presidential ticket , and gave Blaine a majority of 779 . Harrison 's majority in 1888 was 887 . O'Brien was Chester A. Arthur 's right-hand man when Mr. Arthur had control of the Republican machine here and when he and Roscoe Conkling were the ruling spirits of the party in the State . While Mr. Arthur was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had . the employment of many men . He distributed such patronage as he had in his control in a manner that added strength to his following . He was removed from his place as Weigher by Collector Merritt in 1878 . O'Brien , however , was not many hours out of a political berth . John Kelly had taken a fancy to him , and at that time elly controlled the two Democratic members of the Police Board , and secured O'Brien 's appointment as Chief of the Bureau of Elections . Ile held this place from 1878 until last January . When Mr. Arthur became Vice President of the United States O'Brien succeeded . him as Chairman of the Republican County Committee , and served two terms in that capacity . To O'Brien many men now prominent in local polities are under obligations for pushing them along into places of more or less power . It was lie who put ex-Coroner Nugent in charge.of the machinein the Fourteenth- ** He was instrumental in bringing out Barney Biglin as a politician . He took Solon B. Smith out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Assembly . Jacob M. Patterson also got a helping hand from him , and Michael Dady of Brookly and several others were guided by O'Brien in their early ventures inpolitece . It was after the Presidential campaign of 1884 that O'Brien began to get into trouble with the County Committee . Jay Gould had given $30,000 for campaign purposes in that yeas ' and the leader of the Eighth was accused of diverting some of this fund to other than Republican uses . There was much growling and many denials . Some of the other leaders made up their minds then to get rid of him , but it was not until after the campaign of 1888 that he and his followers were thrown out of the County Committee , and his district was reorganized . The specific charge against him at that time was that he backed Grant instead of Erhardt for Mayor . There was a great fuss at the time that he was rejected by the County Committee , and . his followers have always , ' claimed that he wee never given a fair hearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Platt , they say , owed much to O'Brien , but he went back on him I in his extremity . " Had Platt said the word , " said one of his old lieutenants , " the County Committee would never have turned him out ; but he did n't do it . Platt was ungrateful to O'Brien . He wanted . to be made a PoilteJustice after the deal kWe went tJarouga. in Albany last year , but Platt said no , and let Taintor have the place . The original arrangement was that O'Brien should get it . " His last appearance at a ponvention was at Saratoga last Fall . He was contesting his right to seats in the body with the delegates sent up under the reorganization . O'Brien ' 13 people had , elected their own delegates and they ' went to Saratoga to fight it out . The matter was discussed before the Committee on Contested Seats , and Cornelius 11 . Bliss made a speech in which be said that no money could be obtained for campaign purposes from business men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in settling the dispute , and the O'Brienheti were denied admission to the convention . At the election last Fall O'Brien 's people in the Eighth ran a " citizens " " " ticket with Goetz for Alderman and " Silver-Dollar " Smith for the Assembly . They were defeated .. Later on they drifted into the Business Men 's Republican Organization . Mr. O'Brien 's wife was a Miss Lanthier , sister of Mr. Louis A. Lanthier , the art dealer , and of Central Office Detective Lafayette Lanthier . Mr. O'Brien leaves four grown children . John Louis O'Brien , his eldest son , is a lawyer , and . has a place in the Corporation Counsel 's office . Joseph O'Brien recently bought out Wood 's photographer 's gallery on the Bowery . His two daughters are Evangeline , now Mrs. Charles Bader , and Miss Florette O'Brien . At Mr. O'Brien 's own request there will be no church funeral , no display , and ec , nail bearers . His funeral will take place at 1 o'clock Wednesday from his late residence , 62 Rivington Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvary Cemetery . ? ? ? ? - 4:0 WHAT HIS OLD FRIENDS SAY . The news of Mr. O'Brien 's death was not generally known in the Eighth District until evening . Then little knots of the dead man 's acquaintances , both those with and those opposed to him politically , gathered along the streets and rehearsed the stirring events in his life , each one finding a good word for his abilities and his good-heartedness . In regard to the future of Republicanism in the district , the consensus of opinion seemed to be that the O'Brien Association had been placed so firmly on its feet by its leader that it would be able to go on under the lieutenants that Mr. O'Brien had trailed in its old . vigorous style . Barney Rourke , " Silver-Dollar " Smith , Sam Engel , Etienne Bayer , and a number of other well-known O'Brienites all spoke in that way , and , indeed , seemed . to think that their leader 's death m*ht have the effect of bringing the " regular Republicans " in the district into the O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ranks capable of filling his place , but said that unless unforeseen internal squabbles sprang up , the district would make a grand Republican showing in the Fall . " Johnny told me himself some little time ago during the early part of his illness , " said Mr. Smith , " that he thought the association was strong enough to get along without him , and that if its principal men worked together and in harmony the district could be kept Republican for many years . His death is a big blow to us , though , and I doubt if we shall ever find another man who had the genius for local politics and organization that he had . " A great many of the association members dropped into the rooms at Grand-street and the Bowery during the evening to talk over the event , and . President Rourke announced that a Special meeting to consider arrangements for attending the funeral and to draw up resolutions of regret would be held at the clubrooms this evening at 8 o'clock . " One thing we can promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have the biggest funeral that ever went out from this neighborhood . "
