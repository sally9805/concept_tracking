txt Seventy-five horses lost their lives last evening by a fire in Stevedore Richard Fitzpatrick 's stable , 452 and 454 West Nineteenth Street . Most of them were on the second floor , tied in their stalls . A dozen , which had been freed by the stableman , met death in a struggling heap in the runway , leading to the ground floor . The stable was a three-story brick building . In it were about eighty tons of hay . When the hay was reached by the flames , such a lively fire resulted that it was with the greatest difficulty that John Fitzpatrick , his wife , and their six children escaped . They lived in rooms on the third floor . John Fitzpatrick is a brother of the owner of the stable . The fire started a few minutes after S o'clock . Stableman Jacob Hart , who also served as watchman at night , was feeding the horses on the second floor . He noticed no smell of smoke , but suddenly there shot up from the ground floor a'tongue of flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the second floor would be engulfed . He rushed from stall to stall , cutting the halters . He succeeded in setting free a dozen horses . Then the smoke became so dense that he had to give up and hurry to save his own life by running down the stairs at the side of the building . The horses liberated by Hart made a dash for the runway . As the leaders reached the bottom they were met by the flames and smoke . Wheeling , they attempted to push back . Those behind crowded forward , and in a moment sail were struggling , kicking , and biting , and ranking an uproar that was heard a block away . Gradually the noise died away as , one after another , the poor beasts succumbed to the smoke . Mr. Fitzpatrick estimated the loss at 850 , - 000 . He had insurance for 825,000.
