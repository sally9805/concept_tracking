txt In spite of the stupid and uncalled-for interference of United States Senator Hill , Chairman Murphy . and the Democratic State Committee , the Democratic Party of Albany , under the leadership of D. Cady Herrick and James H. Manning , achieved a signal and brilliant victory to-day in the city and county . Mayor Manning , the energetic son of the late Daniel Manning , was re-elected Mayor of Albany by a majority of 5.500 . Thirteen of the seventeen members of the Board of Aldermen were elected by the Democrats , who also control the next Board of Supervisors , electing seventeen out of the thirty-one members . In many respects this result was a complete surprise . The Republican candidate for Mayor of Albany was Gen. James M. Warner , a graduate of West Point . a hero of the rebellion , who wore the star of a General before he was t wentyseven years of age , and who , as Postmaster of Albany , has refused to discharge a number of competent Democrats at the command of a number of the Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was regarded as possible , the Republicans were confident of carrying the Board of Supervisors , and the most hopeful of Democrats Conceded that such a result was possible , The result , however , proves that even with the officious interference of Hill and Murphy the splendid organization which Daniel Manning made in this county , and which Judge Herrick has maintained successfully , resisted the heavy charges made against it and elected , in spite of internecine strife and treachery , Ma entire ticket which was nominated at the regular convention . The Hill faction , which controls all the valuable franchises in the city , which disburses all the patronage in the Capitol and the City Hall , gathered together a fund which was judiciously handled in several of the wards of this city . In the Fifth Ward the Hill crowd , under the management of Judge Hugh Reilly of the Court of Claims ; Andrew Hamilton , its Clerk ; Eugene Wood , the well-known politician , and Anthony N. Brady , the contractor , paid as high as $20 and $30 for votes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgraceful . A gang of heelers of Edward Murphy 's crossed the river from Troy and attempted to stuff the ballot boxes in two districts . The Inspectors resisted , and the Troy thugs attempted to snatch the boxes . The police intervened and with drawn clubs took possession of the ballots and carried them to Police Headquarters . Here the mob , sullen and ugly , gathered , and for a while it appeared as if a raid would be made by the lawless characters from the adjoining county . It is a fact generally admitted that Gov . Flower , Senator Hill , and Chairman Murphy are directly responsible for the disgraceful scenes that were enacted to-day . The fault is laid directly to the veto of the Cohoes Election In- ' specters bill , a just measure . Had not Gov . Flower vetoed that bill , had not David B. Hill advised it , had not Edward Murphy demanded it , the election to-day would have been peaceable . The whole purpose of that veto was to defeat John T.

Garside , defeated by his own party for the nomination , is defeated for election by the people of the city . His defeat is a defeat for the Chairman of the Democratic State Committee .
