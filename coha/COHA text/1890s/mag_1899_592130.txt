IMPROVEMENT IN CITY LIFE . I. PHILANTHROPIC PROGRESS . Av*rEn the civil war , and when the great financial depression of the early seventies was passing , conditions were already shaping themselves for the beginning of a new phase in the development of our cities . The rapid rise in population was well under way . About half of the increase in the population of the whole country , from 1860 to 1870 , was in cities . Other factors , also , in the striking change toward city life , were at work . The war had given an enlarged idea of nationality . Patriotism was more conscious of its own depth , and had laid a strong foundation for civic pride . Prosperity was returning . The larger field offered by more populous cities , the strong invitation to public spirit which they extended , the means to better them and the impulse to do so , all came together . Yet the immediate result was disappointing . The opportunities offered by the cities were for evil as well as for good . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fairer or better cities , but over against that opportunity was the temptation to officials of great private gains . In 1871 , this official unscrupulousness received a notable demonstration in the revelations regarding the Tweed ring at New York . How influential a part it played in turning attention throughout the country to reform in the management of cities , it would be hard to say . The part was certainly great . There has been a new awakening of civic spirit in more recent years . In the winter of 1889 , for instance , there was much discussion , at least , - a series of lectures in Boston on Municipal Government Reform , one in Providence on Problems of Municipal Government ; and so urgent was the demand in Cincinnati , Cleveland , Toledo , and Columbus for reform that a conference was held of representatives from each of those cities . The national conferences on good city government were begun soon afterward . Perhaps as much was done in the permanently important department of revising charters as in the attempt to elect good men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary . The very swiftness of city growth involves political danger . Whether a city owes its rapid increase in numbers to immigration or to the draining // of the country districts , it can make no claim on an hereditary loyalty of its newcomers . In most of our principal cities a large majority of the inhabitants are foreign born or children of foreign parentage ; and in some of them , unfortunately , this mixed character of the population is helped to longer life and sharper distinctness by the existence of communities which discourage a sense of unity . Such communities are colle*tions of nationalities rather than of citizens . The cities that have grown most rapidly have hardly had time , as Dr. Albert Shaw has said , to arrive at " civic self-consciousness , " and yet they have swallowed up the older , smaller cities of which they are the successors . The specific efforts for the improvement of cities , apart from the sporadic general effort along political lines , divide themselves into three classes , - aesthetic , educational , and philanthropic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classification serves to group the struggles with fair accuracy . In passing , it may be noted how these divisions correspond to the three Old World classes of society . If we have no " higher , middle , and lower " classes , as they exist in Europe , we yet have that form of them expressed by an English writer who has said that " humanity is divided into pounds , shillings , and pence . " The philanthropic efforts mainly help the pence , the educational reach the shillings , and the esthetic , while ostensibly devised for all , gratify chiefly the pounds . Happily , with us this social coinage is interchangeable , but the three denominations can always be found . It is curious to note , too , though the distinction is of no importance , how well philanthropic , educational , and iestlietic effort to make fairer cities conform respectively with Plato 's the Good , the True , and the Beautiful . Charitable and educational work , the one through the influence of the church and the other through the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The need of these , also , was more pressing . Statues , monuments , sky-lines , can wait ; but bodies and minds must be fed . It is not surprising that , in the development of the higher urban life , *estlietic improvement comes last . But we are a people that make history rapidly . When a single life may span the time between virgin forest or sandy plain and a city noble in size , aspect , and altruistic endeavor , we may expect to find movements which are logically far apart crowded close together . An important point in the history of an American city is reached when its people have time to turn their attention from its sewers , its protection , and other fundamental necessities , to what is recognized as its " higher life . " The commonness of the term shows how generally that point has been reached . All things will not be done orderly and wisely in a democracy , for progress proceeds in a zigzag line . An administration dependent on the good will of taxpayers is not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks until the demands upon the treasury for sewers , pavements , and even schools have to some extent been satisfied , or until the public is willing to incur an increase in expense to gain this end . One may regret the delay , from a sociological point of view , and it may largely increase the expense over what would have been necessary before land had appreciated in value ; but when the work is undertaken it is full of significance . It means that the bulk of the people want parks . At the same time , there is preserved , by the freedom of the rich to use their money as they please , whatever charm and instruction lie in watching the acts of an untrammeled and blundering iiidividual . If it were possible , in the compass of a magazine article , to give a detailed history of the popular movement in any one of the three directions for better cities , we should find a bewildering mixture of humor , pathos , tragedy , // and achievement . But detail must be sacrificed ; efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than for themselves . Judgments must be stated summarily , and a seemingly arbitrary choice of examples must be made . Yet it is easy to see the drift , and to note how wide and strong the movement is become . In this article I shall make a rapid survey of some of the most significant results of the strong philanthropic movement in city life , and in two subsequent articles I shall summarize some results of educational and aesthetic work . The replies of most of the individuals whom , in preparing these articles , I asked to name what had been done " to improve life " in their cities , contained lists of charities . This fact is suggestive . It shows how large and important a place the altruistic effort holds in the popular mind . The replies repay scrutiny . There is rarely mention of that official effort in which the government - state , county , or town - assumes responsibility for the physical well-being of its poor . Almshouses , poor departments , city physicians , and asylums are not given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are not regarded as evidences of especial activity . Some of the activities named were not relevant . rrhat which merely relieves a social condition , without attempting to prevent the recurrence of the need of relief , does not lift the city to higher things . Curative work is better than palliative , and preventive is best of all . Unhappily , this distinction is not fully grasped . The philanthropic impulse is so strong , and until lately has acted with so little authoritative check or economic study , that much harm has always to be deducted from the good which the altruistic fashion of the time has done . We must bear this waste in mind , in noting the general course which our urban philanthropy takes . in City Life . Church work comes first . Urban problems have caused the old methods to undergo a gradual change , and the " institutional church * has been developed . A notable example is one in New York city . The church expended $160,000 in 1896 from voluntary contributions for poor relief . It employed six clergymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls ; and had an employment bureau , in addition to its other agencies for moral , physical , and intellectual betterment . It is a particularly well-marked case ; but every city has some such example ; nearly all churches are affected to some degree ; and the aggregate effect upon city life is great . For the church - Gentile and Jew , Catholic and Protestant - still plays the largest part in the social activity of modern cities . There has always been a mass of urban beneficence which could not act through the church , and would not if it could . How great this mass has become , and how wide and varied are its manifestations , may be shown by statistics regarding the beneficent societies in New York city . These omit all church organizations , missions , and religious orders . There appear ' to be 106 " public " in the sense of " official " charities in the limits of the enlarged New York . Of this number 73 are city and county , and no account is made of baths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 538 societies are supported by individuals for the purpose of giving temporary relief ; 95 more are for rendering special kinds of relief for special causes . There are also 36 for foreigners ; 158 for various forms of permanent relief ; 328 for surgical and medical assistance ; 50 homes and asylums for the defective and afflicted ; 9 provident and savings associations ; and 103 societies for the furtherance in other ways of social , economic , and physical improvement . In other words , aside from all the public charities which are supported by general taxation , and aside from New York Charities Directory , 1898. // the immense beneficence directly carried on by the churches and maintained by voluntary contributions , there are 1423 organized forms of philanthropic endeavor in the single city of New York . The showing might be made considerably stronger by including mutual and beneficial societies , savings banks , and reformatories . Much of this effort , however , has little to do with the subject in hand . A great hospital - and there are superb ones in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only addition to the growing loveliness of the city is its indication of a sentiment of pity . The hospital , it may be added , is a flatteringly high type of the activities here referred to . That philanthropic work is too much duplicated is obvious . Dr. F. G. Peabody says , in an article on Poor-Relief in America , written for a German encyclop*dia , that " the multiplication of voluntary relief societies has become not only a source of pride in the country , but also one of its embarrassing riches . " The New York State Board of Charities , in its annual report to the legislature for 1898 , also called attention to the matter , saying that it believed there were more than 4000 empty beds in the children 's institutions of New York city . This strange evil of excessive or illdistributed urban generosity had , however , been realized before . At Buffalo , late in 1877 , the first Charity Organization Society was established , as a protest against a lavishness in beneficence which was wasteful of resources and pauperizing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brooklyn , the organization was preceded by an effort to abolish or reform municipal outdoor relief . In Philadelphia and many other cities charity organization practically supplanted outdoor relief . An idea of the saving to taxpayers thus effected is gained from a report made at the twentieth National Conference of Charities and Correction ( 1893 ) . It appears that Brooklyn , where outdoor relief was abolished in 1878 , had appropriated $141,207 in the previous year for this purpose ; that Indianapolis saved $82 ,  - -  000 in its appropriation ; that Philadelphia saved $60,000 by abolishment , and Buffalo $50,000 by reduction . Other similar gains are recorded . This movement of association , which was already proving successful in London , and toward which there had been attempts in Boston , in Germantown ( a suburban ward of Philadelphia ) , and in New York city , spread rapidly . In 1882 there were 22 charity organization societies in the United States . Ten years later there were 92 of these and affiliated societies , having many thousand special visitors ; for the effort to individualize relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The population of the cities they represented exceeded then 11,000 ,  - -  000 . National , district , and local conferences had been instituted , and a periodical literature of the subject was appearing . There has since been no backward step , and in organization we recognize an important principle of urban philanthropy . Charity organization , as a protest against waste and duplication , has secured in addition to economy and system two other advantages . They are efficiency and the procurement of data for scientific social study . The efficiency achieved is not wholly in the granting of temporary relief . There is a permanent gain to the beneficiary , and so to society at large , in the stand against pauperization . Direct gratuitous help is discouraged , and employment is found for beneficiaries . Organization helps men to help themselves , in realization that the truest charity , like the truest art , is that which conceals itself . In such work it is a permanent factor in city betterment . The securing of reliable data for study is a later development of the movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Half a dozen years ago the invested resources of charity organization were put at $630,000 , though the accumulation of endowments had then had slight opportunity . It does not lack now for material evidence . The Charities Building in Boston , the headquarters of the local movement , is a memento of early efforts to systematize popular beneficence , and antedated the Associated Charities . The first distinct endowment of charity organization was , appropriately , at Buffalo . This was in 1880 , when one of the citizens established the Fitch Cr*che . It is not only one of the leading institutions of the city , but is probably the best of its kind in the country . The Cr*che affords accommodation for the offices of the society , includes an accident hospital , and , in furtherance of its purpose to promote industry and thrift among the poor , contains a training school for domestics and nursery maids , which is unique in the United States . Of greater spectacular impressiveness is the United Charities Building in New York , dedicated in 1893 . The structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole cost , $600,000 , may properly be included here among the assets of organized private charity , though the equity of the Charity Organization Society is estimated at only a fourth of this . In general , charity organization , in some form , has come to be indissolubly associated with the philanthropic side of municipal development . Private munificence , through individual donors or by popular subscription , has erected in many cities a central structure which is the charitable power house of the city . This is often in itself , as well as in what it stands for , one of the landmarks of the perfectly developed city ; for under the general head of charity organization , with its central buildings , its salaried secretaries , and its elaborate printed directories , is to be included much of the philanthropic activity of a modern city . The vital , permanent foro in the better city 's development is , not the multiplicity of movements , but the principle of systematic cooperation . This has the directing power to urge - or , better yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private charity . Within the last few years a modification in the charity organization plan has been suggested and has had limited trial . Curiously , this also originated in Buffalo ; and under the title of the Church District or Buffalo Plan it has been adopted in a few other places . It proposes a division of the city into districts , and a distribution of these among the churches . The church which takes a district is to look after it with the thoroughness with which a politician looks after votes . It is to become responsible for its " moral elevation , " and , with the aid of the charitable institutions of the city , for the material relief of its needy . In Buffalo the plan has been tried in connection with the Charity Organization Society , and the first working report - published in January , 1898 - indicates a moderate degree of success . The experiment is interesting , as suggesting within the church a growing sense of responsibility to the city . The assumption of obligation seems , however , unduly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying with considerable success a church federation for sociological work . Cleveland during the last few months , and Allegheny for a longer time , have made use of a Charity Clearing House . The idea underlying the church plans was well expressed by Mr. Talcott Williams , who , writing of the higher life of Philadelphia , a few months before the Buffalo Plan was adopted , said , in unconscious advocacy of its principle , that if Philadelphia - in which every third adult in four fifths of the population had assumed the solemn vows of church membership - failed to be " a city of God on earth , " the fault lay " in divided churches , in // scattej*d responsibility , in 546 organizations where 100 would do the work infinitely better , in lack of all sense of territorial responsibility , so that the wearied clergymen I know are doubling and triplicating each other 's trips , like milkmen seeking each a family or two in a block . " Passing from attempts at cooperative and systematic charity , we come to another movement generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , university , or neighborhood settlement . There are more than a score of these institutions , conducted by educated men and women , who have consecrated themselves to the task of practicing instead of preaching the brotherhood of man . In spite of the seeming hopelessness of their small number , they exert a strong influence for permanent betterment , since a little " soul , " a little consciousness of man 's divinity , and a little hope do much to instill manhood and womanhood , and the will to conquer adverse circumstances . It is significant of how far we have gone in our respect for humanity , however dragged down and disguised by ignorance , extreme poverty , vice , and bestiality , that we think it worth while to arouse aspirations and ambitions that often can lead only to struggle and discontent . A large and real part of the work of the neighborhood settlement is material and intellectual . It is a centre of clubs , lectures , classes , and concerts . At Hull House , Chicago , which was founded in 1889 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are also cooperative boarding houses for both sexes . These are cordially indorsed by the labor unions . There is a day nursery , a gymnasium , a restaurant , and a " noon factory delivery , " supplying hot lunches at ten cents . There is a free physician and a trained nurse , a public dispensary and a labor bureau . Hull House has secured and maintains a playground in the ward . It publishes a Bulletin , and is the ward VOL . LXXXIII. - No. 498. 34 post office . At least 2000 persons are regular visitors at the House every week . A settlement in another city includes upward of thirty clubs , of which that composed of kindergarten children is the only one not self-governing . All this work is done without attempting to preach a spe ! cial religion or any social economy except the simple doctrine of better , cleaner living . For several years our universities have offered courses in sociology . Those undergraduates whose enthusiasm and earnestness have led them to choose the task of poor relief as a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses make of philanthropy the science which undoubtedly it ought to be . With the summer of 1898 the movement extended a little further . The Charity Organization Society of New York offered a post-graduate course in sociology , open to qualified graduates of universities and to experienced workers . It lasted six weeks . Four weeks ' work of actual practice in the offices or districts of the society was accepted in lieu of tuition . Sessions were held , with lectures , five mornings a week . Wednesday mornings and Saturday afternoons were given to visiting institutions , and the course which began with an examination for admission ended with an assigned thesis . The new idea that poor relief is a science , not a sentiment , expects to find justification in the products of such instruction as this . To these class rooms go much of the data so carefully collected , and from them ought to come formulated knowledge and working plans . All these agencies represent fairly well the organized effort at relief that puts its stamp on the hearts of the people rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a group of church buildings , or a charity building , the effect of these associations on the aspect of the city is indirect . They lead to cleaner streets , neater doorsteps , and less* mendi // cancy by their operation on human hearts . There is , however , an increasingly large department of urban philanthropic effort which acts directly upon the city 's aspect . Possibly the most striking example is the better tenement movement . It t*an be best studied in New York , where the need is greatest . Philadelphia is celebrated as a city of small homes . In Chicago there has been such room for growth as to avoid serious congestion , except in the foreign colonies . But New York has the foreign colonies , many old buildings as well , and the most terrible congestion in the world . The nearest approach to New York is in the plagueridden districts of Bombay . In all of Europe there is only one city district , a small part of Prague , that is even half as crowded as are parts of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the city live in tenements , in the common meaning of that term , as this leaves out of the count the tenants of the poor was put into legal form , and it was two years later that a similar effort was made in Boston . The reports of the various investigation committees have led to good results in some of the reforms insisted upon . The Board of Health in New York , for example , had not been conscientious in its revelation of the tenement evils . In 1878 the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor appointed a Committee of Public Hygiene , to act in cooperation with the Health Board and the Tenement House Inspection . This was the beginning of the efforts which had their highest development in the Tenement House Commission of 1894 . On this commission were some of the most prominent and respected men of the city . Its report commanded such confidence as to give to the proposed legislation the successful backing of public sentiment ; and there happened to be a municipal admninistra tion that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenement law that may well be studied . The risk of night fire is lessened by the banishment of dangerous trades from the tenement houses . It is required that 25 per cent of each lot be left open , and that every room have a window to the outer air . In addition to the direct benefits of securing a window , this is a gain to the tenant of three square feet in the hundred over the previous custom of the Building Department ; and the commission reported the discovery of many old rookeries in which 93 per cent of the lot was covered with brick and mortar . The law requires , also , that every new tenement shall be provided with sufficient fireproof stairs and doors . A census discovered 14,000 tenements in which there was no light in the hallways at night . The new law insists that halls shall be lighted not only at night , but by day if no outer light enters . In addition to such corrective legislation , the Health Department , in 1896 and 1897 , seized 93 tenements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condemnation proceedings the death rate was taken as the guide , with such success that , although the landlords had resort to the courts , they were beaten . The results fully justified the Tenement House Commission in having declared that " the legislation which will most favorably affect the death rate of New York is such as will do away with the rear tenements , and root out every old , ramshackle , disease - breeding tenement house in the city . " But the better housing movement needs to be positive as well as negative . It was well enough to turn tenants out of veritable slaughter houses and tear the buildings down , but where should the tenants go ? Real estate in crowded cities is so valuable that the solution of the problem can not safely be left to individual munificence . Our large cities do have model tenements so provided . // and there are several small societies , such as the Cooperative Building Society of Boston , that have this aim ; but the solution of the problem must rest , as it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In response to this requirement , an enterprise is under way which is the outcome of an Improved Housing Council that was held in New York . A stock company was formed , with a capital of $1,000,000 ( increased to $2,000,000 in June , 1898 ) and the best financial backing . It was incorporated under the title of the City and Suburban Homes Company . Late in 1896 it offered its shares at $10 each at public sale . The stock had been already taken by the original guarantors , but it was thought best to distribute it widely , in order to interest a larger number of people . The directors offered the shares as a safe five per cent investment . The company 's field is Greater New York . The first buildings erected were on a plot of 19 city lots on Sixty-Eighth and SixtyNinth streets , between Tenth and Eleventh avenues . The handsome buildings are of a type which is generally called fireproof . Each is 100 feet square , with an interior court about 30 feet square . Apartments have two , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 square feet of floor area , and no living room less than 144 feet . Laundries equipped with steam - drying rooms are furnished free , as are baths , in the basement . Each little suite is provided with conveniences . Another branch of the company 's business is the construction of suburban cottages , to be sold to wage earners on the installment plan . Applicants are required to select sites within areas owned by the company , and the latter erects the houses . As the company 's profit is limited , the tenant has the advantage of the saving from wholesale building and of the rise in the value of land . Before the stock was offered for public sale nearly 400 applications had been received for homes , and suburban areas have been laid out in very attractive ways . A system of life insurance accompanies the installment payment for these houses . Such an enterprise by no means solves the tenement problem , though perhaps it is not an objection that , from the sociological point of view , the beginning is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plan can be made evident , more capital will be attracted . It is said that in Great Britain ? 12,000,000 are invested in this way , and that in London alone 160,000 people are provided for in model tenements . The work has been well termed " philanthropy at five per cent . " The influence of rapid transit on this phase of urban development is obvious . For instance , it has made the suburban part of the New York company 's work possible . In far larger measure it works through individual action to relieve municipal congestion . On similar lines with this movement are many good lodging houses , small and large , where the poor may find cleanliness , moral and physical , no dearer than filth and temptation . Extending from the $1,000,000 Mills House in New York to the little mission lodging , and accepting pay in coin or in work , they are numerous enough to deserve an article by themselves . But they supply the needs chiefly of the homeless ; for their gnests are mainly the single and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than curative or preventive . The " homes " established for various more permanent boarders , such as apartment houses for business women and flats for clerks , have a better claim to attention ; but in this country they have not generally met with large success . The enterprise is interesting , and has long been attractive to capitalists . Some day one of the experiments may succeed on a scale that will encourage imitators . But at best the dream of a city whose // Improvement renting poor live in model homes maintained by philanthropic landlords is felt to be utopian . Perhaps no one confesses to having such a dream . At all events , there is a consciousness that in the meantime much can be done to alleviate present conditions . Attention is turned , therefore , not only upon wretched homes themselves , but upon their environment , and for this the municipality is directly responsible . Work that is done to this end is closely connected with a city 's improvement . The more popular remedies - one is tempted to join in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the poorer quarters , baths , playgrounds , and recreation piers . The first asphalt pavement in the United States was laid only twenty-five years ago . So closely have these pavements been identified with the effort to make handsomer cities , and so great has been their cost , that the idea of laying them in a city 's poorest quarter is very new . But that idea has lately had a chance to show its value on a generous scale . In New York city , during Mayor Strong 's administration , many thousand square yards were laid in the tenement districts . The advantages claimed were increased cleanliness , with its consequent healthfulness , and a more satisfactory playground for children . Public baths and lavatories are still a novelty in America . The public lavatories are mainly confined to parks and buildings . Until lately , the best free public baths in the United States were in Brookline , Massachusetts . In New York , the Tenement House Commission reported that only 306 persons out of a population of more than a quarter of a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived . Yet there were flo baths open all the year round , provided by the city ; for those on the river front are available during only a short period . The lack is partially met by private philanthropy in the Association for Improving in City Life . the Condition of the Poor , the Baron de Hirsch fund , the Riverside Association , the De Milt Dis*iensary , and a few minor organizations . Philadelphia organized in 1895 a Public Baths Association . This has erected an excellent bath house . In Boston the city took up the matter , with the result that on October 15 , 1898 , there was formally opened to the public a bath house of much beauty , and one that had the unique distinction , in a city well provided with bathing facilities for hot weather , of being its first permanent bath for use throughout the year . It is a three-story structure , cost $70,000 , and can accommodate 1500 persons . The basement contains an up-to-date laundry , where the experiment of washing at a moderate cost for poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is expected that this will prove but the first of several permanent bath houses in different sections of Boston , supplementing the summer facilities offered by the state at Revere l*each , by various private associations , and in some of the gymnasiums and parks . In Baltimore the city makes a small appropriation for free summer baths , and the Maryland Public Health Association has enlisted in a movement for free indoor baths . At Yonkers , Chicago , and Buffalo there are city baths . The natatorium which was constructed , along with a gymnasium , in Douglas Park at Chicago , in 1896 , is said to have been the first free resort of the kind in the West ; and Buffalo 's bath house , which was opened June 1 , 1897 , bears a tablet to the effect that it is the " first free public bath house in the United States . " It was erected under the provisions of a state law , passed as far back as 1895 , requiring all cities with a population of 50,000 or more to " establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health may determine to be necessary . " The law adds that the maintenance of river or ocean baths shall not be deemed a compliance with its provisions . The act , applying // to the most prominent cities of the state of New York , promises the beginning , still strangely delayed , of an important movement in this direction ; and the success of the first experiment under it has been so marked that another public bath house is to be opened , in the summer of 1899 , in the Polish district of the city where it was tried . Other legislation in 1895 , 1896 , and 1897 authorized the city of New York to proceed at once to the erection of one or more public baths ; but compelling sentiment on the subject is of slow growth . In Brooklyn , an appropriation of $150,000 has been secured for the erection of a large public bathing pavilion at the foot of the Ocean Parkway . Playgrounds open the way to a larger movement . New York , Chicago , Philadelphia , Boston , and smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The playground movement is to be distinguished from that for parks , as more purely philanthropic . Agitation several years ago opened the schoolhouse yards of Philadelphia to children in the summer , public opinion approving the engagement of teachers , and the provision of necessary materials and conveniences , at the expense of the Board of Education . Private owners have been induced to permit lots to be used for the same purpose , until they should find a commercial use for them . The furnishing of these has been looked after by the Culture Extension League . To this organization is due great credit ; for it was early and persistent in its efforts to arouse public sentiment to the need , though a City Park Association had opened a playground as early as 1894 . The summer of 1897 witnessed in Philadelphia the opening of other grounds . In Fairmount Park a large area was set aside for this purpose , and a rich Philadelphian , who recently died , left $50,000 by will for the erection in the park of an excellent playground house . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the experiment was the city 's excuse for an extension of the plan . The Small Parks Association was organized , and so crystallized public sentiment that the city began the purchase and equipment of special playgrounds . One of these , opened in 1898 , is said to be the most complete of its kind in the country . The expense of it was shared equally by the city and the Culture Extension League . It is situated in a neighborhood where there are more than 3000 children who have no other place to play in than the streets and alleys , and near four populous foreign settlements which have nothing in common with one another , and which have refused ordinary friendly advances . Its function is thus twofold , since it brings the parents together at the band concerts , and at other times , in social intercourse . At the north and south ends there are substantial buildings for boys and girls . In each a large room is devoted to games and gymnastics . At one end are the lunch room and the shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher who directs the play within doors . The building is heated by steam . Around the outer edge of the square are broad grass plats , with flower beds and public fountains . The winding gravel walks are dotted with swings , seesaws , and seats , for the little folks and their elders . Maples and lindens will beautify and shade the grounds . There is a bicycle track , protected by an iron fence and spanned by a bridge . Inside the track there will be a skating pond in winter , and in summer tennis courts and ball grounds . On a raised grass plat to the south is the girls ' playground . A large sand pile for the little children is protected from the weather , and near this are the flagstaff and the band stand . Two teachers are in attendance . In the summer of 1898 twenty-five school yards were opened , and a small appropriation was made for their maintenance . Other cities have not been backward . // In Boston , which was the pioneer , the municipal sand piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a playground and of an effort to satisfy it . Their success has led to their adoption in many large cities , and on an extensive scale in Baltimore . Mrs. Kate Gannett Wells has happily described their creation in Boston . Her description , condensed from The Congregation- alist , is as follows : The use of three mission chapel yards was obtained , and at the end of the season there had been less sickness and more order among the children living near those yards than for many a summer . The next year ten sand heaps flourished , some in courts of tenement houses , the tenants themselves acting as overseers from their windows . Then the sand was given , as it has been since . The third year the ladies petitioned for a few school yards , guaranteeing neither expense nor injury to the city , and the school committee granted the request . In 1$96 there was an average daily attendance of 1802 children , in ten weeks , in ten yards . Every yard has two or three paid kindergartners or young matrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , is of the advanced type of playground movement . It is managed by women , with the financial aid of the city , where the river Charles flows through the poorer quarters . A street marks the line between the men 's and women 's divisions . The children have sand heaps and grass plats , and the gymnasium constructed here was the first open-air one in the world . There is also a lodge , containing books and baths . In the seventh annual report , covering the year 1897 , it was stated that 218,572 women and children attended one of these divisions , and the statistics were practically those of six months only . The Massachusetts Emergency and Hygienic Association maintains playgrounds , and the Episcopal City Mission has playrooms . In the winter of 1898 permission was given to the city to expend $200,000 a year to obtain a comprehensive system of playgrounds , and under the Park Act ten tracts were secured . Some school yards also were opened last summer . In New York the beginning of the playground movement was made about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been passed authorizing the city to expend $1,000,000 annually for small parks below One Hundred and FiftyFifth Street . This law showed a recognition of a need for such parks , but the opportunity granted was never fully embraced until 1893 . In October , 1890 , at a meeting presided over by Bishop Potter , the Society for Parks and Playgrounds for Children was organized . It grew out of a distinct sentiment in favor of the movement for the tenement districts . In December of 1890 the first playground under this society 's control was opened . It comprised sixteen full lots in a tenement neighborhood . The lots were given to the society without rent by their owners , and were fitted up with apparatus for exercise , play , and comfort . An employee was put in charge of the children , and the opening of the ground exerted a wide influence through the sympathetic descriptions in the city press . As a result of this agitation , and perhaps under the influence of a Playground Society that was already established in Brooklyn , public-spirited private citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are not under society control . The Tenement House Commission , in addition to other legislation , secured the passage of an act to compel the city to expend $3,000,000 in three years for small parks , at least two of which should be below Fourth Street . This , with the strongly awakened public sentiment , which in 1898 secured from the legislature permission to open the schoolhouse playgrounds for summer recreation , seemed to assure the progress of the movement . In the spring of 1898 , however , it was made more cer // tam by the formation of the People 's Recreation League . This is a union of a large number of societies , including the Social Reform Club , the Charity Organization , the Children 's Aid , the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor , the various East Side settlernents , and many others . The league becomes the playground committee of these societies , centralizing their influence and unifying their efforts . It furnishes playground attendants , purchases apparatus , and last winter turned some of the grounds into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan , which last year appropriated $15,000 for maintaining and equipping playgrounds in a score of school yards . Last summer , also , the Federation of Churches conducted a playground , and the movement had a good start in Brooklyn , where ten school yards were open and other grounds were maintained by private subscription . The crowded condition of the city gave to the movement in New York some novel expressions . Of these , the recreation or play pier has become , perhaps , the most popular . The idea weds commerce to philanthropy , by building over a long pier a second story , where the children of the city can have a playground , and where the mothers and babies can enjoy the coolness and the panorama of the river . Mr. Jacob A. Riis , in a lecture , has called play piers the " most roaring success in all this world . " The first of them was opened in July , 1897 . Every evening and on Saturday afternoons , during the summer , a brass band furnished music such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in singing the popular songs . How successful the experiment proved from the first is shown in part by statistics . The pier was visited by an average of 4000 persons a day for eighty-one days , or by a total of 325,000 persons . On July 27 , 1897 , Philadelphia established a similar play pier ; this was followed by others , and in the summer of 1898 the Civic Club provided concerts on one of them . Late in September , 1897 , New York opened a second pier . This is nearly three times as large as the first , having a capacity of 15,000 persons . In the summer of 1898 Brooklyn took up the experiment , and in New York permission was given to the School Board to have kindergartners in attendance to teach the children how to play . There is also a proposal to have all the piers inclosed in glass and heated , so that they may be available in winter . In Boston the municipal clearing at the North End is nearly akin to a play pier . There the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permitted to lave the earth again , as it did in the beginning . " The city , " said a Boston paper , " has lost two wharves , but it has gained for its people enough sweetness and light to pay back the cost handsomely . " We may well consider what a triumph the new philanthropic movement is making when a daily paper puts forward such an opinion . It had been something for one man to come to the belief that two city wharves might be less precious than the pleasure they kept from the poor ; for we have been accustomed to learn that on commerce is the prosperity of our seaports builded . But a man did think so , and a newspaper published the statement , and nobody protested . A second peculiar development of the playground idea in New York has been the construction of roof gardens on some of the schools . These not only have economy to recommend them , where land is so valuable , but they lift the children far above the dust , the heat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of basements . The narrow and crowded thoroughfares of New York and Boston have of course made playgrounds especially necessary . In Boston , to be sure , the children have had the Common from colonial times ; but in New York , as a city // committee on small park sites reported in 1897 , the children seem to have been forgotten in the planning . The rapid improvement of vacant ground left to them no other place than the streets for play . The committee added that the lack of playgrounds , where the children could expend , free from temptation , the physical vitality which is their heritage , had been " the most efficient cause of the growth of crime and pauperism . " But in no city , as we have seen , are there better playgrounds than in Philadelphia . Hull House , at Chicago , has had a playground for about five years ; but the movement there has only recently spread . Now various philanthropic societies have taken it up , the City Council has made a small appropriation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . The mayor of Toledo presented a little playground to that city in 1897 , in the heart of the workingmen 's district . Providence , Baltimore , Hartford , Cleveland , Minneapolis , New Haven , and Worcester are other cities in which the movement has started , with women generally as its most prominent backers . We need not pause to consider the work of the Fresh Air Fund and various vacation societies . Their beneficence has grown to immense proportions ; but the principle on which they operate is that of making the life of the poor in great cities a little better worth living , in spite of existing conditions . While this is a form of distinctly municipal benevolence , the cities are in no sense their subjects . The large work of the Children 's Aid Society and similar societies claims attention . But their effort is for the individual , without regard to the community in which he may live , though there is important negative benefit to the city in their preventive work . The monts - de - pi6t6 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wise economic benevolence , percentage philanthropy . They save the borrower from the pawnbroker 's extortionate interest , but they decline to give him something for nothing . One of the societies in New York lent $765,000 in 1897 , to about 36,000 persons . Another reported that with loans of nearly $11,000 it had lost only $11 . Municipal farming , which had its origin in Detroit , and has become well known under the alliterative title of the Pingree Potato Patch Plan , was an ingenious provision to meet special conditions . The newness of most American cities and their rapid growth give to it , for the present at least , a favorable opportunity . In 1897 it was carried on in Boston , Brooklyn , Buffalo , Chicago , Dayton , Denver , Detroit , Duluth , Kansas City , Minneapolis , New York , Omaha , Philadelphia , Providence , Reading , Seattle , and Springfield . In New York there was great scarcity of land , but returns were from double to triple the expense . In Brooklyn it was helped along by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots . In Buffalo , where , as in Detroit , it is managed by the city , 10,590 persons were aided in 1897 , and taxpayers were probably saved $30,000 . As a shift to take care of passing needs it is successful . In conclusion , one can say that the tendency of modern urban philanthropy is mainly good . It is immensely overdone . A recent English observer , while praising the manifestation of this kind of public spirit , unconsciously condemned its management . He said that he thought the gifts made during this century in Philadelphia alone , for philanthropy and education , were ten times greater than those made in any city of similar size in Europe . Much of urban philanthropy , also , is insincere . Ostentatious charity covers a multitude of purposes in city life . But , on the whole , these evils are recognized . The institutional church and the church district plan tend to put benevolence in the light of a duty rather than a virtue . Charity organization is // designed to prevent waste and pauperization . Neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity are a protest against making charity mechanical . In the movements for better housing , baths , and playgrounds there is a distinct endeavor permanently to make the city a better habitation . Rapid transit , better paving , and wiser sanitary provision are doing their possibly soulless but helpful work . The future must reveal what is to be the effect of a patronage by politics of the philanthropic movement , - a condition which has lately become marked , notably in the case of the Citizens ' Union campaign in New York , in 1897 . Certainly , the past gives little encouragement to hope that the result will be an improvement . But at least the condition has this significance : it marks how widespread and popular the movement has become , and how fully it has passed from a fad and an impulse into conviction and earnest purpose . Another and more striking lesson to be drawn from this swift review is , how little of all the philanthropic effort really makes for the permanent betterment of our cities , or helps , in measure proportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by genuine municipal progress .
