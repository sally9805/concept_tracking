txt Last year a considerable number of the Members of a company in one of the Pennsylvania regiments were infected with typhoid poison while attending the annual encampment , and became ill after they had returned to their homes . If our memory serves us , two or three of the cases were fatal . This year two companies of the Connecticut National Guard are undergoing a similar experience . The members of Company I , Fourth Regiment , C. N. G. , are residents of Winsted , and seventeen of them have the fever . Bridgeport is the home of the members of Company K of the same regiment . and typhoid has prostrated sixteen of them . These two companies Were oh the same " street " during the encampment , and they used the same well , which was situated at the head of their " street , " and was used by no other company . The investigation now being made by the State Board of Health points to this well as the source of infection . We presume it was exposed to dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few miles from New-London . It takes the name of the Governor in office , sad therefore was called this year Camp Coffin , a grewsome and ominous appellation . It is an easy matter to enforce sanitary laws on the camp grounds of a State during the period or the annual encampment , and it is disgraceful that the citizen soldiers should be infected with typhoid poison in such a place . Ever ' ? National Guard camp ground and encampment should be under the supervision of competent san I tartans representing the health authorities of the State . There is no reasonable excuse for such poisoning as this which has prostrated seventeen persons in one company and sixteen in another , and may kill four or dye of the victims .
