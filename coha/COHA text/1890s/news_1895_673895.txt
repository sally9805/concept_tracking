txt Eugene V. Delis , President of the American Railway Union , has addressed a circular letter to the members of that organization in relation to the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court . He starts out with saying : A. cruel wrong against our great and beloved order , perpetrated by William A. Woods , United States Circuit Judge , has been approved by the United States Supreme Court ; but though prison walls frown upon myself and others Whom you chose as officials of your order , I assure you that neither despondency nor despair has taken the place of the course which has characterized us and our order since the storms of persecution first began to beat upon us . We have not lost faith in the ultimate triumph of truth over perjury , of justice over wrong , however exalted may be the stations of those who perpetrate the outrages . A. review of the great railway strike follows . after which Debs says : In Russia the victim of autocratic displeasure is denied a trial by a jury of his peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Russia the doomed man or woman is arraigned before the supreme despot or one of his numerous satraps . Truth , justice , mercy , are forever exiled . Age , sex , character , innocence , name , and condition count for nothing . It is enough to know that the brave soul yearned for free . dom , and the penalty of exile , imprisonment , or death Is Inflicted , and it has come to this at last in the United States of America that the law of injunction is the will of a despot , and by the exercise of this Russian power , American Railway Union officials go to prison , and the hope Is that by the exercising of this power the American Railway Union will be crushed . In this supreme juncture I call upon the members of the American Railway Union to stand by their order . In God 's own good time we will make the despots ' prisons where innocent men suffer , monumental . This moving circular will be sent all over the country .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
