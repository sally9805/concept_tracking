txt President received a cable dispatch from Ministed Woodford at Madrid to-night announcing that the Spanish Government had granted an armistice for Cuba . In making this announcement Mr. Woodford conveyed it as a piece of news in which this country was vitally interested , but not as an official communication from the Spanish Government to this Government . The receipt of this news has not resulted in any change of the Administration 's programme relative to sending the message to Congress . It was authoritatively announced to-night , that it was the intention of the President to send his message to Congress on Monday . After conferences at the White House to-night , gentlemen who are in the confidence of the President expressed the belief that the grant of armistice would not materially change the policy as already matured . Word that the armistice had been granted by Spain spread rapidly through all official and diplomatic quarters and aroused great Interest and activity throughout the evening . The first word as to Spain 's concession came to Mgr . Martinelli , the Papal Ablegate , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martinelli sent for Archbishop Ireland , and shortly after the message from the Vatican was repeated by the telephone to the White House . About the same time the dispatch from Minister Woodford was received . Singularly. the Spanish Minister , Senor Polo , had received no advices from Madrid up to midnight . M. Cambon , the French Minister . who has been foremost in urging the pacific influence of the powers , was also without direct official notification . At all the embassies and legatibns , however , the armistice was accepted as an accomplished fact , and there were mutual congratulations in diplomatic nuarters over this result , and the expression of belief that it was an augury of peace . The exact terms of the armistice are felt to be the most essential feature of Spain 's concession . At the outset it was supposed to be an unconditional grant of armistice . Later , however , the press advices from Madrid and London stated conditions of a very material character . If these conditions prove to be accurate , they will doubtless complicate the situation here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at . any time heretofore . A Cabinet officer said recently that the Administration had never considered the proposition of withdrawing the American fleet from Key West , and while this was some days ago , it is not believed that such a proposition would meet with any serious consideration . The fact that Spain has granted this armistice as the result of influence exerted by the great powers of Europe and the Pope leads to much conjecture as to how far the material influences of the powers will be given in support of Spain , now that She has yielded to their earnest solicitation . It has been understood thus far that the movement of the powers was purely disinterested and neutral , but the press dispatches from abroad indicate that Spain 's yielding to these Continental influences has established a closer bond than hitherto existed . Assistant Secretary Day was non-committal on the armistice granted by Spain , and refused to discuss it or the bearing it would have on the situation in any way .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
