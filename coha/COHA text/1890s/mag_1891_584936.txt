txt N IN E months of the weather on Mount Washington are held in the clutch of winter . Nearly every day , during that period , on its summit , or within sight of it , the snow flies . Its height is 6,286 feet above the sealeveL As Mount Hermon stands related to the Anti-Lebanon range , so stands Mount Washington related to our Appalachian mountains ; it is the Jebelesh-Sheikh- " the old chief " - for it is nearly always hoary-headed , and its broad shoulders reach far above and beyond those of its neighbors . The tens of thousands of people who visit its summit , after the tree-line is passed , see only a confusion of rocks on the steep inclines-naked , hard , sharp , time-worn , and weather-beaten rocks-on every side . If Nature ever tried to vary the scene by the power of her creative forces , the wind and storm have long ago mercilessly swept away every bush and blade , and torn loose every vestige of clinging moss and curling lichen .

Only a few of those who have thus seen " the crown of New England 's know anything of its winter glories ; while fewer still have climbed over the snow to its summit . The day is coming , though , when the popular winter resorts will include Mount Washington , and the hotel on its summit will be well patronized by delighted climbers . For over a dozen years a winter visit was made less hazardous by the establishment of a United States Signal Service station there ; for it was some moral help to the adventurous visitor to know that , should rough weather overtake him while making his explorations , he could find a place of refuge and a soldier 's welcome until it was safe to make the descent . It would be madness to make the winter visit at the present time , however , for the Government station has been abandoned , and there is no place of refuge there . When a better state of things prevails again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be possible for others to share the pleasures and beauties I will try to describe - provided only , however , that a good supply of health , strength , and courage , sound lungs , a manageable heart , an experienced guide , and a cheerful method of taking disappointment are also guaranteed . The weather and the condition of the highway vary ; therefore cold and storm may change every plan and close in upon every prospect of pleasure on the summit , after all the labor and fatigue of the climb are accomplished . Under such hard circumstances the philosophical mountaineer will form a plucky resolve to try for better fortune the next time winter comes along . The best time to make the ascent is during the first week of March . Then the sun begins to play more warmly upon the snowy slopes and the coolness of the nights forms a splendid crust upon which to climb .

I did not know much about photography or mountain-climbing then ; but ever since we have studied their possibilities together , and they have drawn us into many a strange adventure . This weathering of so many years has strengthened a friendship which can not be broken . I could not write what I have planned without associating the name of this friend-Benjamin W. Kilburn-with it . Together we have as The start was made from Littleton about 7 P.M. , March 2 , 1870 .

They were undimmed by any intervening vapors , and they sparkled with unusual brightness . Their light , caught by the freezing vapor which arose from the body of our little horse , formed a nimbus about her head ; her nostrils seemed to send forth streams of phosphorescence as she sped along . It was so still too . The creaking and cracking of the ice , disturbed by the swelling of the Ammonoosuc from the melted snow which had been sent down from the heights during the day , and the everconstant roar of the distant cascades broke the quiet of the night , but everything else was still . The lights were all out , even in the camps of the woodchoppers by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves . It grew colder and colder as the three hours rolled by , and we found ourselves alternating with the lunch-kettle and a tramp after the sleigh to keep up circulation . It was a new experience to me , and sometimes I wished it was not quite so oppressively lonely . Just after we crossed the river we were startled by a crashing noise among the broken tree limbs which protruded from the snow . We had surprised a noble deer that was coming down into the valley to find water . As he disappeared into the forest he gave that shrill , defiant snort with which we were so familiar , and we felt that , having no rifle with us , we had missed one of the great opportunities of our lives . To lessen the fatigue of the ascent , we planned to halt at the White Mountain House over night . It was ten o'clock when we reached there . We were not sure that even a watchman would be in the hotel at that season of the year , but we took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper window was opened and a head appeared .

" Upon being assured that we both knew how to build a fire , and that we were not dangerous characters , the gigantic woodchopper who had the place in charge came down to the door in his bare feet and admitted us , although , he averred , " it looked like a foolish kind of bizniss to try to go up that maountin . " We thawed away his theories , however , and sealed a contract with him to " kerry " us to the base of Mount Washington next morning on his wood-sled , and to take good care of our horse until we returned . Then we " turned in .

At intervals they opened and revealed the snowy tops of the mountains , with the glorious blue over them . Then they closed in again , swathed the great domes , and drove the light back . The quick changes , with their strange contrasts , were exceedingly striking , and occupied often hung like a tunic upon the mountains , with just their heads appearing , and then they would rise diagonally like the knife of a guillotine , only to fall quickly , and cause the violent struggling and writhing to be repeated . At intervals the sun obtained the mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point of the bayonet he Tuckermans Ravine from Mount Waohington. // A Snow-storm Below . ENGRAVED BY F. A.

In such sharp detail did Mount Washington then stand out that , even with our experience , we fairly shuddered at the thought of climbing up its bleak and broken incline . The sun , acting like the developer upon the photographic plate , brought out the delicacies of light and shade with astonishing power . As we neared the base of the mountain we found that a fresh , deep snow had fallen during the night , through which it was impossible for the horses to pass . We sent them back to their stable , took to the snow-shoes and pushed on . It was then snowing hard , but there was nothing discouraging about that . We knew there was a loggers ' cabin in the woods near the old railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached it just as " John , " the caterer in the camp , had poured the water on the coffee for dinner . We were invited to partake of the humble meal of corn-bread , potatoes , coffee , boiled pickled pork , and black molasses . But I was too hungry to depend on such fare , and secretly sneaked out to the woodshed where we landed our luggage , and made a requisition on the lunch-kettle we had brought from Littleton . ( It is only fair to the warm-hearted loggers to say , that when I returned from the summit , a few days after , I was so changed , in some way , that I heartily enjoyed their food . ) A consultation was now held as to the propriety of making the ascent .

It was a mercy to us that the sky was overcast , for our eyes were thus spared much pain .

" At first I was not allowed to bear any of the luggage . Even my overcoat was carried for me when the work grew warm . But as I displayed my power to endure , first my coat , then the lunch-kettle , and then portions of the apparatus were gradually piled upon me , until I bore a full share of the load . The " wet " photographic process was all we knew about then , and our developing - tent and apparatus aggregated some seventy-five pounds in weight .

" The snow grew softer , even though the sun was not shining . When we could , we took to the rocks in preference . Sometimes they were slippery with ice , when it seemed wiser to walk around them and hold on to them . As to one walking along a muddy path , or over a pavement covered with slush , the opposite side ever seems the most enticing , and he , constantly changing his course from side to side , lengthens his journey with but little gain ; so , when ascending a mountain in winter weather , one is always tempted to diverge from rocks to snow , and vice versa . Hands and knees were sometimes applied to the rocks . Occasionally a broad platform of clear , gray granite afforded a place of rest and an opportunity to look down upon the white world from which we had risen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief , " only gray clouds met the view . Not long before we reached the " Half-way House , " an advance-guard of great snow-flakes came down upon us . They flew about as frantically as hornets . The wind became as fitful as a madcap , and drove us to the leeward of some of the higher rocks to escape the shaking it threatened . * Now the snow seemed ground to powder and was spirted into our faces with cutting force . Overlooking the Clouds . // Then we entered a falling cloud , just as we veered to the right for the last long climb , when a cold northeast sleetstorm assailed us on the left . I never heard such a grinding din as wild natnrc then made . We could not see a yard ahead , and the noise was so deafening we could hardly hear each other speak . " Keen the railway in sight , gentlemen , or we are in danger of losing our way , " said the cautious Mike . We were now perspiring " like August horses , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side toward the storm our beards were gradually lengthening to our hips . Suddenly the wind grew more violent and erratic , and it became darker than twilight . We could not stand alone . Joined arm in arm , one following the other sidewise , we made our way with great difficulty up the now steepest part of the climb . We had looked for " Jacob 's Ladder " as a landmark to guide us , but the driving sleet hid it from us , and we passed it by unwittingly . We bore to the left to try to find it and get our direction ; but failing , we turned to the right again , and tried to make a bee-line across the great curve of the railway to the summit . We floundered about there , confused and bewildered by the storm , and were sometimes compelled to stop , bend forward and turn our backs until the gusts had spent their strength . We were never cold , and made up our minds to gather all the enjoyment we could from this new experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all in the days and nights gone by , so it was now rather exhilarating than otherwise . The real danger of the situation , while it did not make us afraid , caused us to cling closely while we made one more effort to gain ground against the storm . " Mike , do you know where we are " Yis , sur , to an ell , " he said . What a noise was going on then . A thousand whirling stone-crushers , with hoppers filled with the granite of Mount Washington , could not make a greater racket . What a giddy shambling followed Mike 's last honest effort to bring us to a place of refuge . Suddenly we came into collision with an immovable body . The shock separated us . I saw a black , square something nearly facing me . Involuntarily I put my arms out and made a desperate effort to embrace it . When I recovered I found it had embraced me . I had fallen into the open doorway of the old depot building wherein was located the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions followed with less demonstration . In five minutes we stood over the Government cook-stove , thawing out the icicles from our whiskers . The quarters of the observers then consisted of one room , with double floor and padded sides in the southwest corner of the Frost Feathers on the Tip-Top House Msunt Washington . Frost Feathers under the Railway Treatle. // building . Two stoves were used to keep the apartment warm , and very often they failed . Sometimes the wind drew all the heat up the chimneys as a cork is drawn from a bottle . We were made welcome by the observers , who were expecting us . I thought I had never seen other , and were stuffed nearly full with blankets . Yet one could scarcely keep wedged in or warm ; to sleep was impossible . The ascents which followed varied but little in general method , except that the The Last Half Mile  --  the Summit in View . so comfortable a place ; but , in fact , I never passed so terrible a night . The great frame building rocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , and the growling of the storm was more frightful than anything I had ever experienced on the water . The sleeping-places-deep , well-fastened bunks-were arranged at the south end of the room , one over the start was always made in the morning long before daylight , and good weather blessing us , as a rule , we were favored with such natural phenomena as come only in the mountains , and to those who love them enough to arise early in the day to greet them . Our fifth and last ascent was made March 2 , 1886 . Modern inventions assisted . // The " dry " processes of photography were employed , and the journey to the base of Mount Washington was made , mostly before daylight , by the inglorious means supplied by a caboose on a lumber train . A deep snow had fallen upon the mountain the night before , so the ascent had to be started on snow-shoes . We followed the sled-road of the loggers for nearly a mile before reaching the railway . The trees were magnificently loaded . Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain , because the new snow fell upon that which a rain-storm had soaked the day previous . Before we left the trees we heard a blast from an Alpine horn , and then we saw the great St. Bernard dog , " Medford , " come bounding down through the snow , barking a welcome . He was our old friend , and quickly secured the friendship of John 's black Newfoundland by having a frantic tussle with him in the snow . Medford was followed by two of the members of the Signal Service . We had telegraphed our start from the base , and they came down to meet us . The snowshoes were left at the tree-line , where we took to the rock and crust . But both were so despairingly wet and slippery that we left them and tried the cog-rail . It was too dangerously icy ; so our last resort was the cross-ties , upon which there remained a few inches of new snow . Thus we ascended the rest of the way , helped by our alpen-stocks each step in advance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Washington . // ing and bowed down to the work . It required a desperate effort to hold our own against the wind betimes , and a continuously cool head was needed to grasp the situation . When crossing " Jacob 's Ladder " we were compelled to resort to " all fours , " and more than once to lie flat and warmly embrace the ice-clad sleepers until the gusts had spent their strength . Taken altogether , this was the most difficult ascent we made . Aching muscles testified for a week afterward that snow-clad railroad cross-ties do not supply the choicest kind of going to the mountain-climber . It was fortunate for us that we did not plan to make our excursion three days earlier , for on February 27th one of the most violent storms ever known on the mountain took place . The " boys " thought their last day had come . When we tapped at the observatory door the sun shone so brightly , and the air was so clear , that it was hard to realize that it was ever any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must now turn to the account of some of our experiences in the neighborhood . So restless are the elements on Mount Washington that one must move alertly in order to keep pace with the strange mutations which they bring about . A sight once lost is lost forever , for history is never repeated exactly there . The usual excursions made by summer tourists are possible in the winter-time . The " Presidential Range " - Mount Clay , Mount Adams , Mount Monroe , and Mount Madison , lying shoulder to shoulder , apparently within rifle - shot distance-affords a fine climb with better going than is possible in summer , provided there is plenty of snow . Between it and Mount Washington lies a ravine over a thousand feet in depth , which bears the misnomer of the " Gull of Mexico . " Its sides are precipitous and rocky , and the many springs which ooze from them supply the material for magnificent ice formations of varied colors . The tints are imparted by the mineral substances through which the streams find their way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires good courage and a faultless head to explore it ; but the trained climber will like the excitement . When , VOL . IX-lO now sideways , now grappling on all fours , and occasionally lengthwise , descending , you have gained the top of some great jutting . rock , then lie down . Holding fast lest the wind catch you off guard , peer over into the abyss and bear witness to the details of its wild environs . You will then believe any superstitious tale that is told you about the groups of demons which are seen dancing down there on moonlight nights , madly screeching in strange consonance with the roar of the hundred cascades at the bottom of the great pit . From a rock similar to the one I have spoken of , I saw a magnificent display of the winter forces one day . The exhibition began with a crash ! crash ! crash ! underneath me . The time for the release of the stalactites hanging to the rock had come , and they started down the icy slope below . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wildest confusion down , glittering in the sun , the scene baffled description . A channel was cut through the ice and snow deep into the side of the ravine ; the moving mass then started on every side a cannonade of rocks which was simply terrible . Enough ice was wasted to make a millionaire-sufficient granite was torn to fragments to build a block of New York fiats-all rattled down into the gulf at once with maniacal fury , as if their mission were to burst the sides of the great gulf asunder . Some of the masses of ice , striking rock or crust , rebounded like billiard-balls , and , whizzing in the sunlight , glistened like massive diamonds and amethysts and emeralds afire . The horrible grinding of the rocks amid the dust of the snow was even more exciting . Sometimes the rock masses overtook one another in the air , and by the awful collision reduced each other to small fragments . The line of fire was wide enough to sweep a brigade of infantry from the face of the earth . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force against the rocks far down in the depths of the Gulf ! Such exhibitions are liable to occur on a March day , when the sun shines , and they make the descent into the ravine dangerous unless the shadows are resorted to for protection . // The wildest place of all the surroundings of Mount Washington is the wellknown Tuckerman 's Ravine . It affords grand opportunities in winter for witnessing some of the most curious meteorological phenomena . In five minutes after the summit of the mountain is left you are out of sight of all the buildings thereon . The confusion of rocks is the same in every direction , and you are in chaos . The brisk cannonading I have described is of frequent occurrence here ; but even more mysterious is the manomvring of the clouds . Witnessed from a good stand-point far down in the ravine , on a favorable day , nothing could be more grand . Boiling and seething , they rise and ride and drive without *ipparent purpose . I have seen the great masses separate , and one section continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its loss , suddenly it would stop , then go back , make fast to the lost section , and continue on its course around or up the mountain . Sometimes the wind tears the great gray masses asunder and carries them in various directions as easily as a spider hauls a fly across her web . When they have reached the places willed by the invisible power , the detached masses are sent whirling about the neighboring mountains as though in search of some lost member of their force . In the summer time they are not so placid as in winter , for the rattling thunder accompanies such contentions almost any time after the mercury reaches " sixty above . " On a cold day , when the clouds have all been sent on distant missions and no haze obscures the view , the side of Mount Washington toward Tuckerman 's Ravine resembles a steep cathedral roof with thousands of buttresses as white as the finest Carrara marble , and as glittering as the alabaster of the Nile . After a new snow on such a day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting of all exhibitions , takes place . The snow begins , with an ecstatic gyration , to rise from the crest of the ravine in the form of a slender column . It gathers body as it rises , and like the clay in the hands of the potter , seems to swell as though it was a cvlinder , and the snow was rising inside it , increasing its diameter . How it spins - then struggles-then with awful speed approaches the verge of the ravine and leaps out into space . Only a little imagination is needed now to picture the monster reaching out its arms frantically and shrieking . It hangs aloft for a moment , trembling and vibrating ; then the wind receives it in its broad lap , and with relentless hand sows it broadcast over the terrible ravine . One after the other the snow monsters quickly follow-down to their doom . Thus snow-squalls are born , and thus the depth of snow to a thousand feet is packed down in the bottom of Tuckerman 's Ravine to shape the great " snowarch " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always marvellous , may be had when the storms permit a visit to these deep places . It is never safe to go down into them alone , unless calm and clear weather are assured . You may feel that your experience has enabled you to place all confidence in your own eye , in judging of snow and slide , and in unravelling the time-worn and time-scarred passages ; you may feel satisfactorily conscious of the power of your strong arms to hack and hew your way through difficulties ; memories of former tastes of the glorious luxury of being entirely alone , where all nature is beautiful , may tempt you ; but at high elevations in winter you should draw the line . Self-reliance is a good element , but it is always best to pool your supply with another of equal mettle . You take your life in your hands when you attempt " snow-work " alone . A misstep may break a leg or hold you fast . Yet , battling with the elements on Mount Washington is the most exhilarating exercise one can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake of the Clouds " gives the wind a fair chance at the ambitious climber and is a fine experience . The broad expanses on every side cause one to shudder at the thought of being driven down one of them with no power of resistance . In the coloring of the air , so peculiar to this westerly side of the mountain , and in the grandeur of the great sleeping masses which lie down toward the Crawford Notch , and upon // MOUNT WASHINGTON IN WINTER . which the colors fall , no matter when you look upon them , you are sure to find revealed grand features that lift up your soul to a new majesty . A much more picturesque series of excursions is afforded by the " Glen " carriage-road . At night and day , a visit at any look-out on this road well repays for all the labor entailed , and for some measure of risk . On a clear day , when the sunbeams glide over the peaks and up the valleys unrestrained except by the broad shadows of the mountains , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , " are very fine . Toward evening , or close on to a storm coming , the gauzy haze begins to soften the outlines and dilute the coloring of the mountains . Then the mist , rising and thickening , joins forces with the wind , and the creation of the most peculiar of all the results of the cold begins . I allude to what the observers term " frost-feathers . " I have often stooped to " talk " to tiny ones in the Alps , but I believe they are not known elsewhere as large as those found on Mount Washington . The absolute transformation brought about by them is bewilderingly lovely . One hour after the wind has driven every vestige of snow from the summit , and the buildings are as clear of snow as when newly constructed , they may all become covered with frost-feathers so profusely that every rigid outline is gone and every object appears like a confused mass of eiderdown . More than three-fourths of the time the summit is cloud-enveloped , on account of the warm air which arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain degree of humidity is reached , the mist freezes the instant it touches anything . We will suppose that the wind drives it against a telegraph-pole . A frozen layer is deposited upon this , and is instantly followed by another and another until , if the wind does not change , a " feather " branches out horizontally from the telegraph-pole until the strange creation points out into the air , one , two , three-five feet or more . Over this and under it , and alongside of it , other formations go on , shaped like the wings of sculptured angels , or like the tails and wings of doves in the old time tomb-marbles , every bit as pure and white , and soft as alabaster . Their growth is very rapid . If a flat surface is chosen by the eccentric sculptor , then the feathers radiate irregularly from a central point , and are moulded into fascinating patterns as delicate as fern leaves and the feathers of birds , and always at an angle over each other . They are not like ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they are as tough as muscle . When melted , the most pure water possible is the result . Where fractured , their glistening , granular substance looks like marble or alabaster . Everything becomes covered and coated by them . When you tread upon them they are found to be elastic , and a peculiar nervousness takes possession of you . A latticed window covered with them is more charming than an Arabic Mashrebeyeh screen , with its delicately pierced patterns and its intricately chiselled bars . The feathered side of a tall rock appears like an obelisk high in air ; every inch is hieroglyphed by deep cut characters , which , though beyond the ken of your philology , are full of meaning and make plain a lesson of the beautiful . As soon as the wind changes these lovely creations droop , drop , and disintegrate , while others form in their places , always on the windward side of the objects which they choose to glorify . Never does the summit of Mount Washington and the objects about it appear in such imposing glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the signal station on a moonlight night , before the moon is very high , when the frost formations are favorable , and look down the railway , the draped telegraph-poles will resemble a procession of tall spectres-or , if you choose , monks or one-armed dervishes , half in shadow and half in the glittering light , marching to the shrill fifing of the wind or gliding along with the rich contra-basso which comes up from the wide mouth of the ravine . What a bejeweled world it all makes ! If there was no other diversion on Mount Washington , watching the intermittent extinction and generation of the clouds* affords sufficient interest to occupy much of the time . There are " best days " for this , however , as well as for the other sights . The summit of // the mountain must be clear and the sun should shine brightly . Then , if a snowstorm forms , say a mile below , one of the most enchanting of all natural convulsions delights the observer . The unsubstantial formations rival in grandeur the solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chilled by the cold blasts above , the great seas of vapor begin to roll and tumble and pitch , until a regular tempest forms and sways them all . The billows form great swells and depressions . They break angrily against the rocky mountain , and their snowy spray flies high in the air . Rising and falling , twisting and tangling , they tell of the falling flakes and grinding snow-dust with which the earth is being visited . The more the commotion , the more active is the fall going on below . How they toss and tumble , and how magnificent are the changes of light and shade ! I witnessed the finest show I ever saw of this nature , one afternoon , about half an hour before sunset . The great orb seemed to sink into a sea of saffron ; yet it shone with almost painful brilliancy . Suddenly , upon the cloud surface in front of my stand-point , a mile below my feet , a great mass of shining light appeared . It was as brilliant as the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sun-dog "  --  the image of the sun reflected on the white bosom of the snowstorm . It remained in sight for some time and was caught by the camera . The snow-storm continued , and the sun departed amid an attendance of clouds equal in glory to any summer sunset I ever saw . The coloring upon the upper surface of that raging snow-storm was beyond the gift of the painter to counterfeit . As soon as its life went away , the stars began to appear , for night comes quickly . I heard a great screech down in the valley , and saw a tiny glow coming toward me , like a " will-o ' - thewisp . " It was the headlight of a locomotive on the Grand Trunk Railway at Gorham . Then the nearly full moon grew stronger , and a vast triangular shadow of the mountain was projected upon the cloud surface , black and solid and threatening , where but a few moments ago I saw the boiling color . Soon the snow-like sphere cleared the moun tam-top , and all space on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds . But they continued to boil and drive and snow .. From a point opposite I have watched the clouds at break of day and have tramped my circuit in order to keep warm , while the process of sun-rising and cloud - dispersion went on . Few have ever beheld such transcendent glory at sunrise as Mr. Kilburn and I did one March morning from Mount Washington . At first the cloud masses seemed to reach from us , ninety miles , to the Atlantic , over Portland way . A crimson glow , blended into orange and gray , then arose like a screen  --  a background for the enchanting scene which approached . The clouds grew uneasy at this , but joining forces , resisted , and , for a time hindered , the progress of the drama . Then yielding , they separated here and there , and we could , with the field-glass we had , catch glimpses of light through the rifts . The earth was in full sunshine . We saw the streets of the villages . Men , pygmy-sized , were shovelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the clouds shut in and the mountain was in twilight once more . A great cloud-parting took place , and the mass below us broke into a thousand fragments . These gambolled and rolled wildly from side to side , and carried with them fragments of gaudy spectra which resembled broad segments of rainbows . Every moment there was a change of form and color . Again through the rifts we saw the world . Now the many tints became more scattered as the clouds rose with the light and interfered with its course . Only the snow-storm equalled the billowy confusion-nothing ever equalled the coloring . At last a gleam of light shone in the observatory window and caused our sleepy hosts to turn under their blankets . The sun has risen on Mount Washington . Another phenomenon I witnessed , once only . It began between 10 and 11 A.M. , and lasted almost an hour . At first a great , broad , gray ring , quite luminous , appeared around the sun . It was a " clear " day , but the firmament was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as broad , and nearly as lumi // nous as the other , formed , with the sun at its eastern edge and half within the ring . At three other points of this ring , and with the sun dividing it into four equal segments , were " sun-dogs , " very bright , with a prismatic corona around them . One of the ordinary diversions on the hill " is to stand on " Observatory Rock , " west of the signal station and just a little below , to see the great pyramidal shadow of the mountain cast by the rising sun on the snow just before the rosy glow comes shooting over the frost-feathered ridge-pole of the Signal Service station . It is as black as the shadow of the real pyramid cast by the sun or moon upon the yellow sand of the desert of Gizeh . When the atmosphere is sufficiently clear , as it frequently is , the mountains nearly a hundred miles away appear sharp and near . The whole White Mountain range is unobscured . " Oh ! the mountains ! the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed the last sunset together there . " I never saw them look as they have looked to-day . " This was an oft-repeated saying , but it was always true ; for in fact the mountains never appear two days the same . Either sun or storm , or cloud or the seasons , or all combined , work up a composite for each day , always full of character but never twice alike . Therefore the mountain-lover , unlike the fisherman , is " always in luck . " He always finds " peace , beauty , and grandeur " harmoniously blended , and he is ever " brimful of content . " Whether breasting a storm or standing victorious upon some hardly gained height , he is always sure to be repaid well for all his endurance by the glories which surround him . Truly has that stanch climber in the Alps , Professor Tyndall , said : " For the healthy and pure in heart these higher snow-fields are consecrated ground . " Almost everyone is familiar with the duties and the functions of the observers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are peculiar . Seven observations must be made daily . The recording-sheet of the anemometer must be changed at noon . Three of the seven observations must be forwarded in telegraphic cipher to the Boston station . Routine office work - letters received and sent-must have attention between times , and several blank forms must be filled with statistics . The battery and the wire of the telegraph plant must receive careful attention , and the matter of repairs is no inconsiderable one . The station on Mount Washington is the bleakest , and , with one exception , the coldest in the service . Three to four men , including a cook , are usually there , with one cat and one dog . Life would be very hard to bear there were it not for the click ! click ! click ! of the telegraph instrument , which is the active connecting link with the world-the main-stay and hope of these recluses . And then flirtations with the world 's operators is a necessity . A regular consternation occurs in camp when a storm breaks the wires and connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in storm and cold in search for the break rather than be without the assurance of safety which the click seems to impart . The men live on as good food as can be . The larder is supplied in September , and the " refrigerator " ( the top story of the observatory ) is stocked at the same time . Meat and poultry are placed there already frozen , and they do not thaw " during the season . " The water-supply comes from the frostfeathers . Care is taken that two or three barrels of these are stored in the back shed always , and a boiler full of them in half-melted condition is ever upon the cook-stove . A water famine has been known to occur , when , from the oversight of the cook the supply of frostfeathers has been allowed to go down , or poor weather for frost-feathers * comes along . A drink of this all-healing feather water can always be found on the stove , icy cold , if the cook attends to his duty . A hurricane at sea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was literally blown out of bed one night . I was about to accuse my bed-fellow of kicking me out when instantly he came following me . The grind outside was frightful . We knew the airy structure was cabled and anchored to the rocks by ship 's chains , // but they seemed to expand so that it shook like an aspen leaf and creaked like an old sailing-vessel . The wind tussled with the double windows and capered over the roof like a thousand ogres . There was no sleep for anyone when there was " such a knockin ' at de do ' ! " Morning was always a relief after such a storm , even if it brought no cessation and but little light . Sometimes the feathers so obscure the windows that the lamps must be lighted in daytime . At other times the wind tears so through the building that the lights can not burn . With all the fires going the mercury has been known to fall 23 degrees below zero inside the observatory . On December 16 , 1876 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature for the day was 22.5 degrees below . The wind was at 80 miles at 7 A.M. , 120 miles at 12.22 P.M. , 160 miles at 4.57 P.M. , 100 miles at 9 P.M. , and 180 miles at midnight . The force of the wind was terrible , and at times masses of ice were blown loose , making it extremely dangerous to stand under the lee of the building . The window on that side was fastened with planks in case of accident . One of the greatest storms ever known occurred in February , 1886 . The mercury dropped to 51 degrees below zero , and the wind rattled around at the rate of 184 miles an hour . It tore down one of the buildings and fired its parts against the observatory , threatening to break in all its doors and windows and the roof . But the stanch little building had a tough , thick coating of frostfeathers then , which proved to be a real protection to it , and so escaped . It was no pleasant task , however , to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neighboring building as they fell a prey to the angry elements . The anemometer on the roof was carried away from its bearings that night . A few days afterward a similar storm came up , but not quite so violent a one . Mr. Kilburn and I made the ascent the day before . A strong rope was tied around the waist of Sergeant Line when he climbed to the roof to make his afternoon observations , with all but one of us anchored at the other end of the rope . The camera caught him in the act . The wind-cups of the anemometer were spinning around so they could not be seen with the naked eye , and yet in the photograph they plainly show as a blurred circle , or resembling more a tube bent into circular form . But for these excitements " the boys " would suffer from ennui . They insist that their life " on the hill " is not the most happy one in winter . It has frequently been broken into by sorrow and sadness too . One observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone with his dead body for two days before the storm would allow anyone to come up to him . A coarse coffin was made , and a rude sled , and then a solemn procession moved slowly down the mountain-side , over the snow , that the mortal remains of a brave boy might be deposited under the earth . It was a matter of " turn " with the observers who should go to the base periodically with and for the mail . These journeys were often attended with much peril , and necessarily were frequently prolonged so as to cause much anxiety . The relation of one such incident will suffice to show what it meant sometimes to be a member of the Signal Service stationed on Mount Washington . Never was there a kinder heart engaged in the service than that of Sergeant Win . Line , now stationed at Northfield , Vt . He served on Mount Washington for quite five years ( from 1872 to 1877 ) , and I met him there several times . As near as I can remember them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what he considers as his most perilous ascent . It occurred November 23 , 1875 . The day was unpromising . Against his judgment he left Fabyan 's at about 9 A.M. , with the mail accumulated , for the summit . The team engaged to take him to the base could only pass a little beyond Twin Rivers , so from there he took to the snow-shoes . Arriving at the base he found every building deserted . At 11 A.M. , without a word of cheer from anyone , and alone , he began the ascent . The old Waumbek Station-house was passed , and the foot of Jacob 's Ladder was gained in safety after two hours of pretty hard work . The snow was then three or four feet deep , and the gusts of wind began to increase in power and in // frequency . A few steps only could be made in the lulls between the gusts . When the hard blows came he was forced to lie down until they had gone over him . An hour was consumed in climbing the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing tools and railway appliances ) came into view , Sergeant Line tried to reach it . A gust carried him to the railroad track . He caught the T rail in his hands , when his body was blown up against the crossties and held there for some time . The next lull allowed a little progress and the Gulf Station-house could be seen ; but it could not be reached . Said Sergeant Line : " I found I was being swept rapidly toward the Great Gulf , so I floundered myself over against a rock and succeeded in coming to a halt . After resting awhile , assisted by my pike pole , I tried to reach the house , but it was impossible . I could not breathe facing such a wind , so I lay down and backed up the snow-drift which had piled up near the building , feet first . Such procedure was slow , but sure ; thus the house was reached . I could not see it , but I knew when I had reached it , for I fell about six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the house . The wind had driven the snow clear away from the building , all around it , for some distance . I was unharmed and quite content to be out of the power of the wind . At 3.30 P.M. I started on the journey again , having recuperated my strength in the house . Hardly had I opened the storm-door when it was banged shut again with such force as to break it in two . The wind subsided somewhat in an hour , when I made another start . After many efforts I gained the top of the bank of snow only to be whirled back and lodged under one of the supports of the building . I concluded it was useless to try to reach the summit before night , so I returned to the house , and gathering what wood I could , I proceeded to make a fire . When prepared to strike a light , to my horror I found my match-box was gone . It had rolled out of my pocket during one of my tussles with the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match , which had been given me in the morning with a cigar . It was damp ; but knowing that my life depended upon it , I carefully dried it between thumb and finger , and with anxious heart tried to ignite it . Gentle frictions gradually restored it-it ignited-I was saved . At 7 P.M. I had a good fire . I found an old teapot containing some tea that was steeped four months before . It tasted like turnips . But with it and some cakes Mrs. Line had put in my knapsack in Littleton I made a fine supper . I was tired by my day 's work , and soon after I fell asleep . It was 7 A.M. before I awoke . In a few minutes after I was on my way again . I was making good progress and was near the summit when I met my companion , Mr. King , coming down the mountain to search for me . I am sure he was glad to be relieved of a great anxiety , such as we had all shared in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had we reached the platform in front of the hotel on the summit when we heard voices . Immediately three men appeared coming up out of the fog . They were Mr. B. W. Kilburn , of Littleton , and Messrs . Band and Gallagher . The last two had been requested by Mr. Kilburn to join him in his search for me . He had been awakened , near midnight , by the telegraph operator , with the intelligence that I was lost on the mountain . Immediately and alone he started in his sleigh for Fabyan 's , travelling all the rest of the night in the storm and cold . From Fabyan 's he walked to the base . He lost his way once in the meadows before reaching Fabyan 's , as it was then so dark and so rough was the storm . He searched the mountain for me and saw where I had rested on the way . Had he been an hour earlier he would have passed me while I slept . No one appreciates better than I do what heroism it required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related our experiences , an inquiry came from headquarters at Washington as to my whereabouts . In a few minutes after , a message from Littleton came , announcing that six men had left there to help Mr. Kilburn . Then a third message reported that the railroad company had detailed fifty men , with pick and shovel , to search for the man who was // lost . But my brave friend headed off allthese generous enterprises by quickly returning to the base with the intelligence that the lost was found . " Many times the observers risked their own lives to rescue the perishing . A telegram was always sent from Littleton when anyone started " up the hill , " and if a fairly prompt arrival was not made a searching party was at once sent out from the observatory . Help from Littleton was also called for . Brave hearts always responded promptly in such cases . One descent , which I shall describe , was eventful , and typical of all the similar journeys I had made . With long , swinging strides we started down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory to excite the wonder and admiration of the world . The sky was blue and the weather-makers promised us a " clear day . " The dawn had developed into glorious morning , and the sun was pouring its libations of gold and purple over the mountains and down into the frozen valleys . Again we saw the loftier heights tinged with rosy hue , while the limitless shadows which fell upon the snowy slopes caught and repeated the soft azure of the sky . The crust was hard , the rocks were glac6d , and long fields of ice stretched between them , which made the descent a dangerous one . We passed from snow-crust to ice , and from ice to rock alternately . The thin ice upon the rocks , over which the melted snow had trickled the day before , was the most troublesome and required great caution . Once with my alpen-stock I made a mighty advancelonge at such a rock , in order to obtain a stop for breath when I had leaped upon it . Alas ! the ice was not so thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my staff went from my hand , leaping through the air and ringing like a bell as it went . I soon forgot my loss in watching its strange antics . For a moment it glided over the broad iceslope below , half erect ; then it fell and bounded up and down like a rod of iron , until , striking another rock end first , it came up all standing again , then again flew through the air as before . It turned and rolled over and shifted end for end , slid sideways , bounded and leaped , gaining speed as it went , far away from my recovery . The last bound I saw it make was into a ravine . Fortunately we had bound duplicate staffs upon our shoulders , so that no inconvenience followed the escapade . Seeing a wide field of ice below us , and which we must cross , we halted upon a broad-topped rock to take breath and to tighten our luggage before we attacked it . We had passed the frostfeather line now , and the rocks protruded more nakedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noble amphitheatre with clean - swept stage . The crags and spurs supplied the accessories ; the backgrounds and screens were of light and shade most mysteriously composed . In all positions the actors stood , some in simple garb , others with costumes laced delicately and embroidered fantastically by icy needles in hands more deft and skilful than ours . It was a gorgeous scene . How many storm dramas had been enacted there ! But there was a difficulty behind us , and we must turn and face it . It was an ugly spot , and neutralized the pleasure of examining the surroundings somewhat . We made up our minds to glissade the slope , and glissade we did . Before we began my careful companion gave me this piece of advice : " Keep your mind wholly upon your feet and upon your staff . Press down upon the first with all your might and main , and have the other every instant of the time in good position to press it down , hard , in case you fall . If you slip , turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make yourself as wide as you can ; push the point of your staff with both hands hard into the ice under you ; this will probably stop you . Under no circumstances allow yourself to slide on your back . " I did not slip until I came within a few feet of the foot of the slope . Instead of obeying the rules I allowed my mind to rest upon embracing a narrow rock ahead as soon as I came to it . I came to it , face down , sooner than I calculated . The heavens scintillated while I dreamed , and when I came to my wits again I was lying on my face astride the narrow rock for which I had aimed . // VOL . IX. - 17 ENGRAVED BY B. H. DELORME . Sunset . A Sun-dog on the Snow Ciouds. // My plan had succeeded , but the ways and means employed differed somewhat from the details of my drawings . Gussading is an upright and manly diversion-at least it should be upright-but success does not always crown the first attempts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held firmly in both hands and trailed after you at one side . Do not allow the head to change places with the feet ; resist all intimacy on the part of the ice . Have no collision with it . The stars belong to the heavens , and should only be seen with the eyes cast upward . Do not sit down to work nor " take a header " willingly . Press the steel point of your staff vigorously into the ice , if you falter , and secure a soft place for recuperation before you fall . Perhaps if I had not been thus brought to a stand-still we should never have obtained the sublime views we had over the bristling trees across the country and down into " the lower regions , " as the observers say . Turning our eyes to the summit we saw veils of thin clouds winding around the mountain in folds which excited our atsthetic fervor . Then they thickened into long furrowed lines , dark and threatening , and these began to roll and toss about . " The whispering grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Weather Proverbs " used by the Signal Service says . The truth of this was verified to us now , because , as if in sympathy with the disturbance gathering about the summit , the groves a half mile below us began " whispering* ' ominously . We knew what it meant . The sky was yet clear , but the wind began to blow furiously from the west-southwest . It had been snowing from there down to the base for two or three days , and we no sooner left the ice-slopes than we had to meet the deep drifts . The great trestles of the railway were snowed full , and we dared not try descending on them . For descending they are always dangerous . We had to flounder through the deep snow the best we could . We could not make our way to the little tool-house where our snow-shoes had been left . Up to the waist , then , we plunged . Our progress was very slow . It grew suddenly much colder , though it was below zero when we started . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rising snowcolumns we could see the gusts coming . Before they reached us we locked arm in arm , turned our backs , bent forward and allowed them to sail over us . Gradually our mustaches froze over our mouths , and our eyes were sealed so we could not see . Frequent halts were made to thaw in some daylight , and secure breath . Sometimes a treacherous drift led us to an icy bottom , when we slipped and became almost buried in the snow . The contest for position in this world was reins-trying , but we thoroughly enjoyed it , and more tears and frozen eyes were caused by our laughter than by the snapping , irascible wind and cold . Once in a while , when I squeezed the arm of my companion , with whom there was no fear necessary , he would reach his spare mittened hand to his mouth , thaw out his voice , and say : " Do not be afraid , I am right here by your side . " It is always safer to go around a mountaindrift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to understand when it is safe to attack drifted snow . It is at times very treacherous . Mount Washington Signal Station . // It may slip while you are pushing your way over it , and , avalanche-like , rush down some steep incline with you ; or , it may have become separated from the rocks which it covers , by the melted snow running underneath on warm days , when it is liable to crush in with you and overwhelm you . It is a good plan to test it with the alpen-stock before risking life upon it . With my experienced friend I never felt that there was any danger of going into a pit unless he went too . His strong arm has rescued me from danger many a time , and as frequently has he carried me over the rough places on his shoulders . There is a great contrast in our make-up . He , broad and strong and muscular as an ox -I , tall and slender-light-weight and wiry . Both had attained a quick and springy step , and a mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question for one to oppose himself to the other in time of periL At last we reached the woods , and hugged as closely to the railroad as we could ; for now and then the wind had cleared a sort of " path . " But the frequent pitfalls twisted our legs and bruised our feet , so that as soon as possible we turned to the right and made 155 our way down into the sled-road then in use by the wood-choppers . One time I took a run down a slope which seemed to have a crust upon it , but presently I broke through and fell forward . As I yielded to circumstances I intuitively put out my hands . They went into the snow up to my shoulders and there I had to remain , face down , all fours fastened in a drift more than a dozen feet deep , until Mr. Kilburn came to my release . Soon after we heard the ringing of the woodsmen 's axes , and in twenty minutes more we were at the base , safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little river , cajoled by the benign warmth of the sun , had burst its bonds , and piled the " anchor-ice " several feet high on either side . Countless rivulets of melting snow were pouring into it . The commotion was almost equal to that at the mouth of an Alpine glacier . It was like the closing of some magnificent scenic opera . The soft , sweet music caused by the explosion of the bubbles bewitched the air . Each swollen , sparkling stream came along charged with individual ring and resonance-each one came cheerily to contribute its melody to the orchestral tumult farther on.
