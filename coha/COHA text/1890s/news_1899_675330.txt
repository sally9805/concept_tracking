txt The interesting address iolivered at Princeton University by Mr. WurrkuAw Rain on Saturday . on the occasion of the commemorat , on of the one hundred and fifty-third anniversary of the founding of the university , is impressive as coming from a source regarded as not entirely in sympathy with the Administration at Washington . Mr. REID believes with Bishop DOANE that events have imposed a responsibility as well as conferred an opportunity upon us . He says : 1-lold fast ! Stand firm in the place where Providenoo has nut you , and do the duty a just responsibility for your own past acts impose , . Support the army you sent there . Stop wasting valuable strength in showing how things might be different if something d fferent hail been done a year and a half ago . Use the educated thought of the country for shaping best its course now , instead of chiefly finding fault with its history . Bring the oest hope of the future . thecolleges. an the generation they are training to exert t he greatest influence and accompisn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations and the ihevitable tendencies of the American people . rather than against them . I7nite the efforts of all men of goodwill to make the appointment of any person to these new aild strange duties beyond seas impossible save for proved fitness , and his remo v-al impossible save for cause . Rally the colleges and the churches , and all they influence , the brain and the conscience of the country , in a combined and irresistible demand for a genuine , trained , and pure civil service in our new possessions that shall put to shame our detractors , and show to the world the Americans of this generation . equal still to the work of civilization and colon-zation , and leading the development of the coming century as bravely as their fathers led it in the last . The expansionists and anti-expansionIsts of the United States , seemingly so widely far apart , are really separated more by their attitude and language toward the Administration and its methods , and perhaps its lack of immediate success in the Philippines , than they are as to principles involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the most extreme and vehement critics of the President and his supporters do not believe that the bulk of the people of the United States , in their confidence in the President , could be blinded by it to approve a policy tending to the subversion of republican ideas and the enslavement , politically , of the Filipinos , the Cubans , or the Puerto Ricans . Mr. RECD very temperately , carefully , and helpfully discusses the Philippine situation , as a man convinced that the manly course , our only course . is to go on in our work in the Philippines in the same spirit and with a like intent to that in which we have prosecuted our work in the West Indies . To deal " diplomatically " with the Tagalos would , he wisely remarks , be to mislead those who have chosen to fight us , and to prolong our difficulties , and who would misconstrue a policy characterized by weakness . So he would continue a military government until it is clearly no longer needed : then gradually withdraw military Governors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependencies under an American civil Governor , with foreign relations , their courts and financial system organized and protected by an American civil service system , with a steady tendency to self-government : and finally , to make the Philippines autonomous colonies , " looking to us for little save control of their foreign relations ; profiting by the stability and order and hacking a powerful Nation guarantees : cultivating more and more intimate trade and personal relations with that Nation , and coming to feel themselves participants of its fortune and renown . " It is the hopeful and helpful view of the difficult problem , not the one of the Chicago denunciators of the President , who ask us to believe that we are a Nation of incapables and tyrants . It is an appeal addressed to the ambition as well as the patriotism and intelligence of the American people . The other view should be presented , to be most effective , to the rebellious Tagalos , and if it were wisely effective then it would lead to the adoption of a course very like that which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
