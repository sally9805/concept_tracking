A PERSONAL NARRATIVE OF THE OVERLAND TRIP TO CALIFORNIA . WAS a child when we started to California , yet I remember the journey well and I have cause to remember it , as our littleband of emigrants who drove out of Springfield , Illinois , that springmorningof 1846 have since been known in history as the " Illfated Donner party " of " Martyr Pioneers . " My father , James F. Reed , was the originator of the party , and the Donner brothers , George and Jacob , who lived just a little way out of Springfield , decided to join him . All the previous winter we were preparing for the journey  --  and right here let me say that we suffered vastly more from fear of the Indians before starting than we did on the plains ; at least this was my case . In the long winter evenings Grandma Keyes used totell me Indian stories . She had an aunt who had been taken prisoner by the savages in the early settlement of Virginia and Kentucky and had remained a captive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was fond of these stories and evening after evening would go into grandma 's room , sitting with my back close against the wall so that no warrior could slip behind me with a tomahawk . I would coax her to tell me more about her aunt , and would sit listening to the recital of the fearful deeds of the savages , until it seemed to me that everything in the room , from the high old-fashioned bedposts down even to the shovel and tongs in the chimney corner , was transformed into the dusky tribe in paint and feathers , all ready for the war dance . So when I was told that we were going to California and would have to pass through a region peopled by Indians , you can imagine how I felt . Our wagons , or the " Reed wagons , " as they VOL . XLII. - 53. were called , were all made to order and I can say without fear of contradiction that nothing like our family wagon ever started across the plains . It was what might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to a regular immigrant train . My mother , though a young woman , was not strong and had been in delicate health for many years , yet when sorrows and dangers came upon her she was the bravest ofthebraye . Grandma Keyes , who was seventy-five years of age , was an invalid , confined to her bed . Her sons in Springfield , Gersham and James XV . Keyes , tried to dissuade her from the long and fatiguing journey , but in vain ; she would not be parted from my mother , who was her only daughter . So the carin which she was to ride was planned to give comfort . The entrance was on the side , like that of an old-fashioned stage coach , and one stepped into a small room , as it were , in the centre of the wagon . At the right and left were spring seats with comfortable high backs , where one could sit and ride with as much ease as on the seats of a Concord coach . In this little room was placed a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wagon , was prevented by a circle of tin from setting fire to the canvas cover . A board about a foot wide extended over the wheels on either side the full length of the wagon , thus forming the foundation for a large and roomy second story in which were placed our beds . Under the spring seats were compartments in which were stored many articles useful for the journey , such as a well filled work basket and a full assortment of medicines , with lint and bandages for dressing wounds . Our clothing was packed - not in Saratoga trunks - but in strong canvas bags plainly marked . Some of mama 's young friends 409 " A PIONEER PALACE CAR . // added a looking-glass , hung directly opposite the door , in order , as they said , that my mother might not forget to keep her good looks , and strange to say , when we had to leave this wagon , standing like a monument on the Salt Lake desert , the glass was still unbroken . I have often thought how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror which gave them back the picture of their own dusky faces . We had two wagons loaded with provisions . Everything in that line was bought that could be thought of . My father started with supplies enough to last us through the first winter in California , had we made the journey in the usual time of six months . Knowing that books were always scarce in a new country , we also took a good library of standard works . We even took a cooking stove which never had had a fire in it , and was destined never to have , as we cach*d it in the desert . Certainly no family ever started across the plains with more provisions or a better outfit for the journey ; and yet we reached California almost destitute and nearly out of clothing . The family wagon was drawn by four yoke of oxen , large Durham steers at the wheel . The other wagons were drawn by three yoke each . We had saddle horses and cows , and last but not least my pony . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember when I was taught to sit a horse . I only know that when a child of seven I was the proud owner of a pony and used to go riding with papa . That was the chief pleasure to which I looked forward in crossing the plains , * to ride my pony every day . But a day came when I had no pony to ride , the poor little fellow gave out . He could not endure the hardships of ceaseless travel . When I was forced to part with him I cried until I was ill , and sat in the back of the wagon watching him beTHIRSTY OXEN STAMPEDING FOR WATER . // qwq them closely , hardly daring to draw my breath , and feeling sure they would sink the boat in the middle of the stream , and was very thankful when I found they were not like grandma 's Indians.Every morning , when the wagons were ready to start , papa and I would jump on our horses , and go ahead to pick out a camping-ground . In our party were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she preferred the wagon , and did not like to leave grandma , although Patty took upon herself this charge , and could hardly be persuaded to leave grandma 's side . Our little home was so comfortable , that mama could sit reading and chatting with the little ones , and almost forget that she was really crossing the plains . Grandma Keyes improved in health and spirits every day until we came to the Big Blue River , which was so swollen that we could not cross , but had to lie by and make rafts on which to take the wagons over . As soon as we stopped traveling , grandma began to fail , and on the 29th day of May she died . It seemed hard to bury her in the wilderness , and travel on , and we were afraid that the Indians would deCHIMNEY ROCK , ON THE NORTH PLATTE ( 1890 ) . stroy her grave , but her death here , before our troubles began , was providential , and nowhere on the whole road tould we have found so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined our company , and all turned out to assist at the funeral . A coffin was hewn out of a cottonwood tree , and John Denton , a young man from Springfield , found a large gray stone on which he carved with deep letters the name of " Sarah Keyes ; born in Virginia , " giving age and date of birth . She was buried under the shade of an oak , the slab being placed at the foot of the grave , on which were planted wild flowers growing in the sod . A minister in our party , the Rev. J. A. Cornwall , tried to give words of comfort as we stood about this lonely grave . Strange to say , that grave has never been disturbed ; the wilderness blossomed into the city of Manhattan , Kansas , and we have been told that the city cemetery surrounds the grave of Sarah Keyes . As the river remained high and there was no prospect of fording it , the men went to work cutting down trees , hollowing out logs and making rafts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty-five feet in length , were united by cross timbers , forming rafts , which were firmly lashed to stakes driven into the bank . Ropes were attached to both ends , by which the rafts were pulled back and forth across the river . The banks of this stream SCOTT 'S BLUFFS ( FROM NATURE , 1890 ) . // being steep , our heavily laden wagons had to be let down carefully with ropes , so that the wheels might run into the hollowed logs . This was no easy task when you take into consideration that in these wagons were women and children , who could cross the rapid river in no other way . Finally the dangerous work was accomplished and we resumed our journey . The road at first was rough and led through a timbered country , but after striking the great valley of the Platte the road was good and the country beautiful . Stretching out before us as far as the eye could reach was a valley as green as emerald , dotted here and there with flowers of every imaginable color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wide , rapid , shallow stream . Our company now numbered about forty wagons , and , for a time , we were commanded by Col. William H. Russell , then by George Donner . Exercise in the open air under bright skies , and freedom from peril combined to make this part of our journey an ideal pleasure trip . How I enjoyed riding my pony , galloping over the plain , gathering wild flowers ! At night the young folks would gather about the camp fire chatting merrily , and often a song would be heard , or some clever dancer would give us a barn-door jig on the hind gate of a wagon . Traveling up the smooth valley of the Platte , we passed Court House Rock , Chimney Rock and Scott 's Bluffs , and made from fifteen to twenty miles a day , shortening or lengthening the distance in order to secure a good camping ground . At night when we drove into camp , our wagons were placed so as to form a circle or corral , into which our cattle were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing them , the camp-fires and tents being on the outside . There were many expert riflemen in the party and we never lacked for game . The plains were alive with buffalo , and herds could be seen every day coming to the Platte to drink . The meat of the young buffalo is excellent and so is that of the antelope , but the antelope are so fleet of foot it is difficult to get a shot at one . I witnessed many a buffalo hunt and more than once was in the chase close beside my father . A buffalo will not attack one unless wounded . When he sees the hunter he raises his shaggy head , gazes at him for a moment , then turns and runs ; but when he is wounded he will face his pursuer . The only danger lay in a stampede , for nothing could withstand the onward rush of these massive creatures , whose tread seemed to shake the prairie . Antelope and buffalo steaks were the main AN EMIGRANT ENCAMPMENT . // article on our bill-of-fare for weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ; our appetites were a marvel . Eliza soon discovered that cooking over a camp fire was far different from cooking on a stove or range , but all hands assisted her . I remember that she had the cream all ready for the churn as we drove into the South Fork of the Platte , and while we were fording the grand old stream she went on with her work , and made several pounds of butter . We found no trouble in crossing the Platte , the only danger being in quicksand . The stream being wide , we had to stop the wagon now and then to give the oxen a few moments ' rest . At Fort Laramie , two hundred miles farther on , we celebrated the fourth of July in fine style . Camp was pitched earlier than usual and we prepared a grand dinner . Some of my fathers friends in Springfield had given him a bottle of good old brandy , which he agreed to drink at a certain hour of this day looking to the east , while his friends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a companion bottle with their faces turned west , the difference in time being carefully estimated ; and at the hour agreed upon , the health of our friends in Springfield was drunk with great enthusiasm . At Fort Laramie was a party of Sioux , who were on the war path going to fight the Crows or Blackfeet . The Sioux are finelooking Indians and I was not in the least afraid of them . They fell in love with my pony and set about bargaining to buy him . Th*iy brought buffalo robes and beautifully tanned buckskin , pretty headed moccasins , and ropes made of grass , and placing these articles in a heap alongside several of their ponies , they made my father understand by signs that they would give them all for Billy and his rider . Papa smiled and shook his head ; thenthe number of ponies was increased and , as a last tempting inducement , they brought an old coat , that had been worn by some poor soldier , thinking my father could not withstand the brass buttons ! On the sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sioux were several days in passing our caravan , not on account of the length of our train , but because there were so many Sioux . Owing to the fact that our wagons were strung so far apart , they could have massacred our whole party without much loss to themselves . Some of our company became alarmed , and the rifles were cleaned out and loaded , to let the warriors see that we were prepared to fight ; but the Sioux never showed any inclination to disturb us . Their curiosity was annoying , however , and our wagon with its conspicuous stove-pipe and looking-glass attracted their attention . They were continually swarming about trying to get a look at themselves in the mirror , and their desire to possess my pony was so strong that at last I had to ride in the wagon and let one of the drivers take charge of Billy . This I did not like , and in order to see how far back the line of warriors extended , I picked up a large field-glass which hung on a rack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click , the warriors jumped back , wheeled their ponies and scattered . This pleased me greatly , and I told my mother I could fight the whole Sioux tribe with a spyglass , and as revenge for forcing me to ride in the wagon , whenever they came near trying to get a peep at their *var-paint and feathers , I would raise the glass and laugh to see them dart away in terror . A new route had just been opened by Lansford W. Hastings , called the " Hastings Cutoff , " 1 which passed along the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake rejoining the old " Fort Hall Emigrant " road on the Humboldt . It was said to shorten the distance three hundred miles . Much time was lost in debating which course to pursue ; Bridger and Vasques , who were in charge of the fort , sounded the praises of the new road . My father was so eager to reach California that he was quick to take ad 1 For an account of J-Jastings , see THE CENTURY for December 1890 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A TRIBUTARY OF THE PLATTE. // qwq C.

He refused , but came back over a portion of the road , and from a high mountain endeavored to point out the general course . Over this road my father traveled alone , taking notes , and blazing trees , to assist him in retracing his course , and reaching camp after an absence of four days . Learning of the hardships of the advance train , the party decided NATURAL BRIDGE OR LA FR*LR RIVER . // Wells . " The water in these wells was pure and cold , welcome enough after the alkaline pools from which we had been forced to drink . We prepared for the long drive across the desert and laid in , as we supposed , an ample supply of water and grass . This desert had been represented to us as only forty miles wide but we found it nearer eighty . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living thing could be seen ; it seemed as though the hand of death had been laid upon the country . We started in the evening , traveled all that night , and the following day and night - two nights and one day of suffering from thirst and heat by day and piercing cold by night . When the third night fell and we saw the barren waste stretching away apparently as boundless as when we started , my father determined to go ahead in search of water . Before starting he instructed the drivers , if the cattle showed signs of giving out to take them from the wagons and follow him . He had not been gone long before the oxen began to fall to the ground from thirst and exhaustion . They were unhitched at once and driven ahead . My father coming back met the drivers with the cattle within ten miles of water and instructed them to return as soon as the animals had satisfied their thirst . He reached us about daylight .

My father , holding his youngest child in his arms and keeping us all close behind him , drew his pistol , but finally the maddened beast turned and dashed off into the darkness . Dragging ourselves along about ten miles , we reached the wagon of Jacob Donner . The family were all asleep , so we children lay down on the ground . A bitter wind swept over the desert , chilling us through and through . We crept closer together , and , when we complained of the cold , papa placed all five of our dogs around us , and only for the warmth of these faithful creatures we should doubtless have perished . At daylight papa was off to learn the fate of his cattle , and was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ox . The stock , scenting the water , had rushed on ahead of the men , and had probably been stolen by the Indians , and driven into the mountains , where all traces of them were lost . A week was spent here on the edge of the desert in a fruitless search . Almost every man in the company turned out , hunting in all directions , but our eighteen head of cattle were never found . We had lost our best yoke of VOL . XLII. - 54 . The company kindly let us have two yoke of oxen , so with our ox and cow yoked together we could bring one wagon , but , alas ! not the one which seemed so much like a home to us , and in which grandma had died . Some of the company went back with papa and assisted him in cacheing evei-ything that could not be packed in one wagon . A cache was made by digging a hole in the ground , in which a box or the bed of a wagon was placed . Articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hoards , and the earth thrown in upon them , and thus they were hidden from sight . Our provisions were divided among the company . Before leaving the desert camp , an inventory of provisions on hand was taken , and it was found that the supply was not sufficient to last us through to California , and as if to render the situation more terrible , a storm came on during the night and the hill-tops became white with snow . Some one must go on to Sutter 's Fort after provisions . A call was made for volunteers . C. T. Stanton and Win . McClutchen bravely offered their services and started on bearing letters from the company to Captain Sutter asking for relief . We resumed our journey REGISTER ROCK , IDAHO , A LAROMARK OF WESTERN EMIGRATIOR. // and soon reached Gravelly Ford on the Humboldt . I now come to that part of my narrative which delicacy of feeling for both the dead and the living would induce me to pass over in silence , but which a correct and lucid chronicle of subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the 5th day of October , 1846 , at Gravelly Ford , a tragedy was enacted which affected the subsequent father a violent blow over the head with his heavy whip-stock . One blow followed another . Father was stunned for a moment and blinded by the blood streaming from the gashes in bis head . Another blow was descending when my mother ran in between the men . Father saw the uplifted whip , but had only time to cry : " John , John , " when down came the stroke upon mother . Quick as a thought my father 's hunting knife was out and Snyder fell , fa qwq talked to me until I controlledmyfeelings , sothat we could go to the tent where mama was lying . We then learned that trouble was brewing in the camp where Snyder 's body lay . At the funeral my father stood sorrowfully by until the last clod was placed upon the grave . He and John Snyder had been good friends , and no one could have regretted the taking of that young life more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a council to decide upon the fate of my father , while we anxiously awaited the verdict . They refused to accept the plea of self-defense and decided that my father should be banished from the company and sent into the wilderness alone . It was a cruel sentence . And all this animosity towards my father was caused by Louis Keseburg , a German who had joined our company away back on the plains . Keseburg was married to a young and pretty German girl , and used to abuse her , and was in the habit of beating her till she was black and blue . This aroused all the manhood in my father and he took Keseburg to task - telling him it must be stopped or measures would be taken to that effect . Keseburg did not dare to strike his wife again , but he hated my father and nursed his wrath until papa was so unfortunate as to have to take the life of a fellowcreature in self-defense . Then Keseburg 's hour for revenge had come . But how a man like Keseburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could have such influence over the company is more than I can tell . I have thought the subject over for hours but failed to arrive at a conclusion . The feeling against my father at one time was so strong that lynching was proposed . He was no coward and he bared his neck , saying , " Come on , gentlemen , " but no one moved . It was thought more humane , perhaps , to send him into the wilderness to die of slow starvation or be murdered by the Indians ; but my father did not die . God took care of him and his family , and at Donner Lake we seemed especially favored by the Almighty as not one of our family perished , and we were the only family no one member of which was forced to eat of human flesh to keep body and soul together . When the sentence of banishment was communicated to my father , he refused to go , feeling that he was justified before God and man , as he had only acted in self-defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing only too well what her life would be without him , yet fearful that if he remained he would meet with violence at the hands of his enemies , she implored him to go , but all to no avail until she urged him to remember the destitution of the company , saying that if he remained and escaped violence at their hands , he might nevertheless see his children starving and be helpless to aid them , while if he went on he could return and meet them with food . It was a fearful struggle ; at last he consented , but not before he had secured a promise from the company to care for his wife and little ones . SALT LAKE , LOOKiNG SOUTH FROM PROMONTORY . // My father was sent out into an unknown country without provisions or arms - even his horse was at first denied him . When we learned of this decision , I followed him through the darkness , taking Elliott with me , and carried him his rifle , pistols , ammunition and some food . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me stay , but he would listen to no argument , saying that it was impossible . Finally , unclasping my arms from around him , he placed me in ? ? arge of Elliott , who started back to camp with me  --  and papa was left alone . I had cried until I had hardly strength to walk , but when we reached camp and I saw the distress of my mother , with the little ones clinging around her and no arm to lean upon , it seemed suddenly to make a woman of me . I realized that I must be strong and help mama bear her sorrows . We traveled on , but all life seemed to have left the party , and the hours dragged slowly along . Every day we would search for some sign of papa , who would leave a letter by the way-side in the top of a bush or in a split stick , and when he succeeded in killing geese or birds would scatter the feathers about so that we might know that he was not suffering for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot where his had been . But a time came when we found no letter , and no trace of him . Had he starved by the way-side , or been murdered by the Indians ? My mother 's despair was pitiful . Patty and I thought we would be bereft of her also . But life and energy were again aroused by the danger that her children would starve . It was apparent that the whole company would soon be put on a short allowance of food , and the snowcapped mountains gave an ominous hint of the fate that really befell us in the Sierra . Ourwagon was found to be too heavy , and was abandoned with everything we could spare , and the remaining things were packed in part of another wagon . We had two horses left from the wreck , which could hardly drag themselves along , but they managed to carry my two little brothers .

Walter Herron , one of our drivers , who was traveling with the Donners , left the wagons and joined my father . On the *9th of October , while traveling along the Truckee , our hearts were gladdened by the return of Stanton , with seven mules loaded with provisions . Mr. McClutchen was ill and could not travel , but Captain Sutter had sent two of his Indian vaqueros , Luis and Salvador with Stanton . Hungry as we were , Stanton brought us something better than food-news that my father was alive . Stanton had met him not far from Sutter 's Fort ; he had been three days withA DESPERATE SITUATION . ( DRAWN BY CHARLES NAHL. ) // out food , and his horse was not able to carry him . Stanton had given him a horse and some provisions and he had gone on .

My mother rode on a mule , carrying Tommy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , and I behind Mr. Stanton , and in this way we journeyed on through the rain , looking up with fear towards the mountains , where snow was already falling although it was only the last week in October . Winter had set in a month earlier than usual . All trails and roads were covered ; and our only guide was the summit which it seemed we would never reach . Despair drove many nearly frantic . Each family tried to cross the mountains but found it impossible . When it was seen that the wagons could not be dragged through the snow , their goods and provisions were packed on oxen and another start was made , men and women walking in the snow up to their waists , carrying theirchildrenin their arms andtrying to drive their cattle . The Indians said they could find no road , so a halt was called , and Stanton went ahead with the guides , and came back and reported that we could get across if we kept right on , but that it would be impossible if snow fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the summit should be reached , but some of our party were so tired and exhausted with the day 's labor that they declared they could not take another step ; so the few who knew the danger that the night might bring yielded to the many , and we camped within three miles of the summit . That night came the dreaded snow . Around the camp-fires under the trees great feathery flakes came whirling down . The air was so full of them that one could see objects only a few feet away . The Indians knew we were doomed , and one of them wrapped his blanket about him and stood all night under a tree . We children slept soundly on our cold bed of snow with a soft white mantle falling over us so thickly that every few moments my mother would have to shake the shawl - our only covering - to keep us from being buried alive . In the morning the snow lay deep on mountain and valley . With heavy hearts we turned back to a cabin that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We built more cabins and prepared as best we could for the winter . That camp , which proved the camp of death to many in our company , was made on the shore of a lake , since known as " Donner Lake . " The Donners were camped in Alder Creek Valley below the lake , and were , if possible , in a worse condition than ourselves . The snow came on so suddenly that they had no time to build cabins , but hastily put up brush sheds , covering them with pine boughs . Three double cabins were built at Donner Lake , which were known as the " Breen Cabin , " the " Murphy Cabin , " and the " Reed-Graves Cabin . " The cattle were all killed , and the meat was placed in snow for preservation . My TRUCKEE CA*ON. // mother had no cattle to kill , but she made arrangements for some , promising to give two for one in California . Stanton and the Indians made their home in my mother 's cabin . Many attempts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were driven back by the pitiless storms . Finally a party was organized , since known as the " Forlorn Hope . " They made snow-shoes , and fifteen started , ten men and five women , but only seven lived to reach California ; eight men perished . They were over a month on the way , and the horrors endured by that Forlorn Hope no pen can describe nor imagination conceive . The noble Stanton was one of the party , and perished the sixth day out , thus sacrificing his life for strangers . I can find no words in which to express a fitting tribute to the memory of Stanton . The misery endured during those four months at Donner Lake in our little dark cabins under the snow would fill pages and make the coldest heart ache . Christmas was near , but to the starving its memory gave no comfort . It came and passed without observance , but my mother had determined weeks before that her children should have a treat on this one day . She had laid away a few dried ap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small piece of bacon . When this hoarded store was brought out , the delight of the little ones knew no bounds . The cooking was watched carefully , and when we sat down to our Christmas dinner mother said , " Children , eat slowly , for this one day you can have all you wish . " So bitter was the misery relieved by that one bright day , that I have never since sat down to a Christmas dinner without my thoughts going back to Donner Lake . The storms would often last ten days at a time , and we would have to cut chips from the logs inside which formed our cabins , in order to start a fire . We could scarcely walk , and the men had hardly strength to procure wood . We would drag ourselves through the snow from one cabin to another , and some mornings snow would have to be shoveled out of the fireplace before afire could be made . Poor little children were crying with hunger , and mothers were crying because they had so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had been without it so long . Four months ofsuch suffering would fill the bravest hearts with despair . During the closing days of December , 1846 , gold was found in my mother 's cabin at DonDONNER LAKE , FROM THE OLD SACRAMENTO TRAIL . // ner Lake by John Denton . I remember the night well . The storm fiends were shrieking in their wild mirth , we were sitting about the fire in our little dark home , busy with our thoughts . Denton with his cane kept knocking pieces off the large rocks used as fire-irons on which to place the wood . Something bright attracted his attention , and picking up pieces of the rock he examined them closely ; then turning to my mother he said , " Mrs. Reed , this is gold . " Mymotherreplied that she wished it were bread . Denton knocked more chips from the rocks , and he hunted in the ashes for the shining particles until he had gathered about a teaspoonful . This he tied in a small piece of buckskin and placed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here I am coming back for more . " Denton started out with the first relief party but perished on the way , and no one thought of the gold in his pocket . Denton was about thirty years of age ; he was born in Sheffield , England , and was a gunsmith and gold-beater by trade . Gold has never been found on the shore of the lake , but a few miles from there in the mountain cafions , from which this rock possibly came , rich mines have been discovered . Time dragged slowly along till we were no longer on short allowance but were simply starving . My mother determined to make an effort to cross the mountains . She could not see her children die without trying to get them food . It was hard to leave them but she felt that it must be done . She told them she would bring them bread , so they were willing to stay , and with no guide , but a compass we started-my mother , Eliza , Milt Elliott and myself . Milt wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were five days in the mountains ; Eliza gave out the first day and had to return , but we kept on and climbed one high mountain after another only to see others higher still ahead . Often I would have to crawl up the mountains , being too tired to walk . The nights were made hideous by the screams of wild beasts heard in the distance . Again , we would be lulled to sleep by the moan of the pine trees , which seemed to sympathize with our loneliness . One morning we awoke to find ourselves in a yell of snow . During the night , while in the deep sleep of exhaustion , the heatof the fire had melted the snow and our little camp had gradually sunk many feet below the surface until we were literally buried in a well of snow . The danger was that any attempt to get out might bring an avalanche upon us , but finally steps were carefully made and we reached the surface . My foot was badly frozen , so we were compelled to return , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , the most fearful of the winter , and we should have perished had we not been in the cabins . We now had nothing to eat but raw hides and they were on the roof of the cabin to keep out the snow ; when prepared for cooking and boiled they were simply a pot of glue . When the hides were taken off our cabin and we were left without shelter Mr. Breen gave us a home with his family , and Mrs. Breen prolonged my life by slipping me little bits of meat now and then when she discovered that I could not eat the hide . Death had already claimed many in our party and it seemed as though relief never would reach us . Baylis Williams , who had been in delicate health before we left Springfield , was the first to die ; he passed away before starvation had really set in . I am a Catholic although my parents were not . I often went to the Catholic church before leaving home , but it was at Donner Lake that I made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Catholic family in the Donner party and prayers were said aloud regularly in that cabin night and morning . Our only light was from little pine sticks split up like kindling wood and kept constantly on the hearth . I was very fond of kneeling by the side of Mr. Breen and holding these little torches so that he might see to read . One night we had all gone to bed-I was with my mother and the little ones , all huddled together to keep from freezing - but I could not sleep . It was a fearful night and I felt that the hour was not far distant when we would go to sleep - never to wake again in this world . All at once I found myself on my knees with my hands clasped , looking up through the darkness , making a vow that if God would send us relief and let me see my father again I would be a Catholic . That prayer was answered . On his arrival at Sutter 's Fort , my father made known the situation of the emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for their relief . He furnished horses and provisions and my father and Mr. McClutchen started for the mountains , coming as far as possible with horses and then with packs on their backs proceeding on foot ; but they were finally compelled to return . Captain Sutter was not surprised at their defeat . He stated that there were no ablebodied men in that vicinity , all having gone down the country with Fr*mont to fight the Mexicans . He advised my father to go to Yerba Buena , now San Francisco , and make his case known to the naval officerin command . My father was in fact conducting parties there - when the seven members of the Forlorn Hope arrived from across the mountains . Their famished faces told the story . Cattle were killed and men were up all night drying beef and making flour by hand mills , nearly 200 pounds being made in one night , and a party of seven , // Ik** ON THE WAY TO THE SUMMIT . commanded by Captain Reasen P. Tucker , were sent to our relief by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening of February *9th , 1847 , they reached our cabins , where all were starving . They shouted to attract attention . Mr. Breen , clambered up the icy steps from our cabin , and soon we heard the blessed words , " Relief , thank God , relief ! " There was joy at Donner Lake that night , for we did not know the fate of the Forlorn Hope and we were told that relief parties would come and go until all were across the mountains . But with the joy sorrow was strangely blended . There were tears in other eyes than those of children ; strong men sat down and wept . For the dead were lying about on the snow , some even unburied , since the living had not had strength to bury their dead . When Milt Elliott died ,  --  our faithful friend , who seemed so like a brother ,  --  my // mother and I dragged him up out of the cabin and covered him with snow . Commencing at his feet , I patted the pure white snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! it was hard to cover that face from sight forever , for with his death our best friend was gone . On the 22d of February the first relief started with a party of twenty-three - men , women and children . My mother and her fainilv were among the number . It was a bright sunny morning and we felt happy , but we had not gone far when Patty and Tommy gave out . They were not able to stand the fatigue and it was not thought safe to allow them to proceed , so Mr. Glover informed mama that they would have to be sent back to the cabins to await the next expedition . What language can express our feelings ? My mother said that she would go back with her children - that we would all go back together . This the relief party would not permit , and Mr. Glover promised mama that as soon as they reached Bear Valley he himself would return for her children . Finally my mother , turning to lVIr.Glover said , " Are you a Mason ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on the word of a Mason that if we do not meet their father you will return and save my children ? " He pledged himself that he would . My father was a member of the Mystic Tie and mama had great faith in the word of a Mason . It was a sad parting- a fearful struggle . The men turned aside , not being able to hide their tears . Patty said , " I want to see papa , but I will take good care of Tommy and I do not want you to cor*e back . " Mr. Glover returned with the children and , providing them with food , left them in the care of Mr. Breen . With sorrowful hearts we traveled on , *valking through the snow in single file . The men wearing snow-shoes broke the way and we followed in their tracks . At night we lay down on the snow to sleep , to awake to find our clothing all frozen , even to our shoe-strings . At break of day we were again on the road , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frozen snow . The sunshine , which it would seem would have been welcome , only added to our misery . The dazzling reflection of the snow was very trying to the eyes , while its heat melted our frozen clothing , making them cling to our bodies . M* brother was too small to step in the tracks made by the men , and in order to travel he had to place his knee on the little hill of snow after each step and climb over . Mother coaxed him along , telling him that every step he took he was getting nearer papa and nearer something to eat . He was the youngest child that walked over the Sierra Nevada . On our second day 's journey John Denton gave out and declared it would be imVOL . XLII. - 55. possible for him to travel , but he begged his companions to continue their journey . A fire was built and he was Left lying on a bed of freshly cut pine boughs , peacefully smoking . He looked so comfortable that my little brother wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached him poor Denton was past waking . His last thoughts seemed to have gone back to his childhood 's home , as a little poem was found by his side , the pencil apparently just dropped from his hand . Captain Tucker 's party on their way to the cabins had lightened their packs of a sufficient quantity of provisions to supply the sufferers on their way out . But when we reached the place where the cache had been made by hanging the food on a tree , we were horrified to find that wild animals had destroyed it , and again starvation stared us in the face . But my father was hurrying over the mountains , and met us in our hour of need with his hands full of bread . He had expected to meet us on this day , and had stayed up all night baking bread to give us . He brought with him fourteen men . Some of his party were ahead , and when they saw us coming they called out , " Is Mrs. Reed with you ? If she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the call ; mother knelt on the snow , while I tried to run to meet papa . XVhen my father learned that two of his children were still at the cabins , he hurried on , so fearful was he that they might perish before he reached them . He seemed to fly over the snow , and made in two days the distance we had been five in traveling , and was overjoyed to find Patty and Tommy alive . He reached Donner Lake on the first of March , and what a sight met his gaze ! The famished little children and the death-like look of all made his heart ache . He filled Patty 's apron with biscuits , which she carried around , giving one to each person . He had soup made for the infirm , and rendered every assistance possible to the sufferers . Leaving them with about seven days ' provisions , he started out with a party of seventeen , all that were able to travel . Three of his men were left at the cabins to procure wood and assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief ) had not traveled many miles when a storm broke upon them . With the snow came a perfect hurricane . The crying of half-frozen children , the lamenting of the mothers , and the suffering of the whole party was heart-rending ; and above all could be heard the shrieking of the storm King . One who has never witnessed a blizzard in the Sierra can form no idea of the situation . All night my father and his men worked unceasingly through the raging storm , trying to erect shelter for the dying women and children . At times the hurricane would // burst forth with such violence that he felt alarmed on account of the tall timber surrounding the camp . The party were destitute of food , all supplies that could be spared having been left with those at the cabins . The relief party had cached provisions on their way over to the cabins , and my father had sent three of the men forward for food before the storm set in ; but they could not return . Thus , again , death stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly gone ; had it been lost , all would have perished . Three days and nights they were exposed to the fury of the elements . Finally my father became snow-blind and could do no more , and he would have died but for the exertions of XVilliam McClutchen and Hiram Miller , who worked over him all night . From this time forward , the toil and responsibility rested upon McClutchen and Miller . The storm at last ceased , and these two determined to set out over the snow and send back relief to those not able to travel . Hiram Miller picked up Tommy and started . Patty thought she could walk , but gradually everything faded from her sight , and she too seemed to be dying . All other sufferings were now forgotten , and everything was done to revive the child . My father found some crumbs in the thumb of his woolen mitten warming and moistening them between his own lips , he gave them to her and thus saved her life , and afterward she was carried along by different ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels . Hidden away in her bosom was a tiny doll , which she had carried day an*l night through all of our trials . Sitting before a nice , bright fire at Woodworth 's Camp , she took dolly out to have a talk , and told her of all her new happiness . There was untold suffering at that " Starved Camp , " as the place has since been called . XXThen my father reached Woodworth 's Camp , a third relief started in at once and rescued the living . A fourth relief went on to Donner Lake , as many were still there - and many remain there still , including George Donner and wife , Jacob Donner and wife and four of their children . George Donner had met with an accident which rendered him unabl* to travel ; and his wife would not leave him to die alone . It would take pages to tell of the heroic acts and noble deeds of those Who lie sleeping about Donner Lake. , Most of the survivors , when brought in from the mountains , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the generous hearted captain did everything possible for the sufferers . Out of the eighty-three persons who were snowed in at Donner Lake , fortytwo perished , and of the thirty-one emigrants who left Springfield , Illinois , that spring morning , only eighteen lived to reach California . Alcalde Sinclair took my mother and her family to his own home , and we were surrounded with every comfort . Mrs. Sinclair was the dearest of women . Never can I forget their kindness . But our anxiety was not over , for we knew that my father 's party had been caught in the storm . I can see my mother now , as she stood leaning against the door for hours at a time , looking towards the mountains . At last my father arrived at Mr. Sinclair 's with the little ones , and our family were again united . That day 's happiness repaid us for much that we had suffered ; and it was spring in California . Words can not tell how beautiful the spring appeared to us coming out of the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark cabins under the snow . Before us now lay , in all its beauty , the broad valley of the Sacramento . I remember one day , when traveling down Napa Valley , we stopped at noon to have lunch under the shade of an oak ; but I was not hungry ; I was too full of the beautiful around me to think of eating . So I wandered off by myself to a lovely little knoll and stood there in a bed of wild flowers , looking up and down the green valley , all dotted with trees . The birds were singing with very joy in the branches over my head , and the blessed sun was smiling down upon all as though in benediction . I drank it in for a moment , and then began kissing my hand and wafting kisses to Heaven in thanksgiving to the Almighty for creating a world so beautiful . I felt so near God at that moment that it seemed to me I could feel His breath warm on my cheek . By and by I heard papa calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *hild , we are ready to start , and you have had no lunch , " I ran and caught him by the hand , saying , " Buy this place , please , and let us make our home here . " He stood looking around for a moment , and said , " It is a lovely spot , " and then we passed on .
