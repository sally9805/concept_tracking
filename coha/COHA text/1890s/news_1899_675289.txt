txt In a letter to Chairman Dick of the Republican State Executive Committee , Secretary of State Hay makes this emphatic statement regarding the alleged secret alliance between England and the United States : " There is no alliance with England , or with any other power under heaven , except those known and published to the world ? the treaties of ordinary international friendship for purposes of business and commerce . No treaty other than these exists : none has been suggested on either side ; none is in contemplation . It has never entered into the mind of the President or of any member of the Government to forsake , under any inducement , the Wise precept and example of the fathers which forbade entangling alliances with European powers . " This is a portion of a letter written by Secretary Hay from Newbury , N. H. , regretting his inability to be present at the opening of the Ohio Republican campaign at Akron on Sept. 23 . In the course of the letter Mr. Hay disciisses campaign issues as follows : MONEY HOBBY COLLAPSED . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have lost , for all practical purposes , their political stock in trade of recent years . Their money hobby has collapsed under them . Their orators still shout 16 to 1 from time to time , from the force of habit , but they are like wisdom crying in the streets , in one respect at least , because ' no man regardeth them . ' With our vaults full of gold ; with a sufficiency of money to meet the demands of a volume of business unprecedently vast and profitable ; with labor generally employed at fair wages ; with our commerce overspreading the world ; with every dollar the Government issues as good as any other dollar ; with our finances as firm as a rock and our credit the best ever known , it is no time for financial mountebanks to cry their nostrums in the market place , with any chance of being heard . " It is equally hopeless to try to resuscitate the corpse of free trade . The Dingley tariff , the legitimate successor of the bill  --  that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not only true that our domestic trade has reached proportions never before attained , but the American policy of protection  --  the policy of all our most illustrious statesmen , of Washington and Hamilton , Lincoln , Grant , and  --  has been triumphantly vindicated by the proof that it is as efficacious in extending our foreign commerce as in fostering and stimulating our home industries . Our exports of domestic manufactures reached in this fiscal year the unexampled total of $360,000,000 , an amount more than two hundred millions'in excess of our ports ten-years ago . These figures.sing the knell of those specious arguments which have been the reliance of our opponents for so many years , and which are only fruitful in times of leanness and disaster . " What is left , then , in the may of a platform ? The reign of Mists ; which the Republicans themselves can manage , having all the requisite experience , both of legislation and business , and , finally , the " war , which , it seems , was too efficiently carried on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic leaders . We have been able to give in our time some novel ideas to the rest of the world , and none more novel than this , that a great party should complain that the results of a war were too advantageous . It will be hard , however , to convince the- bulk of our people that we are the worse off because our flag has gained great honor , our possessions have been extended , our position in the world jncreased , and our opportunity for work and usefulness enormously widened , through the fortunes of war and the valor of our soldiers and sailors . RECOURSE HAD TO FICTION . " Being in this desperate need of arguments , It is not strange that they should have recourse to fiction . An attempt is made in the Ohio Democratic platform to excite the prejudice of certain classes of voters seainst the present Administration by accusing it of an alliance with England . The people who make this charge know it to be untrue ; their making it is an insult to the intelligence of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of their favorite methods of campaign is to invent a fiction too fantastic to contradict and then to assume it to ' be , true because it has not been contradicted ; you may permit me to take one moment to dispose of this ghost , story , as it refers to the department with which I am connected . " Even the men who wrote the Ohio platform know there is no alliance . But they seek to make capital in this campaign out of the Undeniable fact that our relations with England are more friendly and satisfactory than they have ever been before . It is hard to take such a charge seriously , and if it is taken seriously , how can it be treated with patience ? In the name of common sense , let me ask , what is the duty of the Government , if not to cultivate . wherever possible , agreeable and profitable relations with other nations ? And if with other nations , why not with that great kindred power which stands among the greatest powers of the world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this natural and beneficent friendship ? Only a narrow and purblind spirit could see in it anything exclusive . " It is a poor , starved heart that has room for only one friend It is not with England alone that . our relations are improved . We are on better terms than in the past with all the nations . With Russia , our oldtime friend ; with the great German Empire , ito which we are bound by so many ties ; with our sister Republic of France , with Italy , Austria , and , in short , every European , every Asiatic nation , our relations are growing in intimacy and cordiality every year , and our friendship with our neighbors to the south of us , from the Rio Grande to Cape Horn ; grows firmer , more genuine , day by day . SOLVING A FIXED PROBLEM . " And why should it not be so ? Every one likes to be on good terms with the peaceable and the prosperous , especially if their hospitality is of that nature that other people profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our trade is taking that vast development for which we have been preparing through many years of wise American policy , of sturdy American industry , of thoughtful invention and experiment by trlined American intelligence . We have gone far toward solving the problem which has so ' Ong vexed the economists of the world  --  of raising wages and at the same time lowering the cost of production  --  something which ao other people have ever accomplished in an equal degree . " We pay the highest wages which are paid in the world ; we sell our goods to such advantage that we are beginning to furnish them to every quarter of the globe . We are building locomotives for railways in Europe , Asia , and Africa : our bridges can be built in America , ferried across the Atlantic , transported up the Nile , and flung across a river in the Soudan in less time than any European nation , with a start of 4,000 miles , can do the work . We sell iron ware in Birmingham , carpets in Kidderminster ; we pipe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Continent ; Ohio sends watch cases to Geneva . All this is to the advantage of all parties ; there is no sentiment In it ; they buy our wares because we make ' them better and at lower cost than other people . " We are enabled to do this through wise laws and the American genius for economy . Our working people prosper because we are all working people ; our idle class is too meagre to count . All the energies of the Nation are devoted to this mighty task ? to insure to labor its adequate reward , and so to cheapen production as to bring the product within the reach of the greatest number for least money . " Of course , our prosperity would not bring us friends if we held an attitude of menace to other nations . But this we have never done , and I hope and believe we never shall do . We have great latent military power ; we are capable at short notice of rem-arkable military efficiency , but the habit and spirit of the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be glad to think that the era of wars was over ; that not another battle anywhere in the world should ever stain the earth with carnage or break the heart of a mother . THE WAR NOT FOR CONQUEST . " No other nation would ever have shown the long-suffering patience with which we watched , for so many years , the scenes of waste and disorder which make the recent history of Cuba . When the state of things at our doors had become intolerable we took up arms to redress wrongs already too long endured , without a thought in any mind of conquest or aggression . But no one can control the issues of war . Puerto Rico'and the Philippines are ours , and the destinies of Cuba are , for the moment , intrusted , to our care . it is not permitted us to shirk the Vast responsibilities thus imposed upon us without exhibiting a nerveless pusillanimity which would bring upon us not only the scorn of the world , but , what is far worse , our own self-contempt . ' But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through the irresistible logic of war  --  we are not striving anywhere to acquire territory or extend our power by conquest . It is no secret that in more than one quarter outlying territory only awaits our acceptance , but every overture of this nature has been , and , I am confident , will be declined . The whole world knows that we are not covetous of land ; not a chancellerie in Europe sees in us an interested rival in their scheme of acquisition . What is ours we shall hold ; what is not ours we do not seek . But in the field of trade and commerce we shall be the keen competitors of the richest and greatest powers , and they need no warning to be assured that in that struggle we shall bring the sweat to their brows . " It was written of old that a man 's foes shall be of his own household . The simple fact is that at this moment the whole world is our friend except certain leaders of the Democratic Party . All countries crowd into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our achievements in war have received the ungrudging praise of foreign nations and meet with unjust and carping criticism only at home . All other countries bid us godspeed in the work of bringing order and civilization to the Philippines , and it was left to a man in Cincinnati the other day to wish that ' Otis and his army might be swept into the sea . ' " It is hard to exterminate a rooted tendency  --  the proverbs say something about braying in a mortar . The party which . by vicious leadership in 1861 , was made th place itself across the path of freedom and progress , should take care not to follow the lead this year of men as lacking in sagacity as they are in patriotism . But we may take comfort in the reflection that no leaders can carry all their party into courses their judgment must condemn and their hearts reject . There are , thank God , many Democrats in Ohio who do not desire the humiliation of their country or the dishonor of their flag . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
