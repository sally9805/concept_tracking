PREFACE There can be in a strict sense no standard text of the plays of Henry C. De Mille . All manuscript copies show variations ; one is not necessarily more correct than another . Playwrights working in the stock company tradition expected no complete conformity , indeed approved or adaptation to immediate needs . During original runs dialogue and stage directions changed more or less from night to night as playwrights or stage managers fitted them more closely to the company . It was not a question of improving the text but of improving the performance , and the performance varied with the actors . When the company changed , the play changed with it . The editor 's problem therefore is not to find the only satisfactory text , but a satisfactory text  --  one among others of which the authors would approve  --  then to correct obvious technical and typographical errors , and see that nothing essential to the play is omitted , nothing plainly extraneous added . The present edition is based on typescripts furnished by Mr. Cecil B. de Mille , approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional permission of Mr. Benjamin F. Roeder , Trustee for the Belasco Estate , and Mr. Daniel Frohman . For the De Mille-Belasco collaborations , these scripts have been checked with those in the Belasco Collection in the New York Public Library . The basic typescripts are not uniform with regard to the nature and detail of the stage directions , stage business , and cues . It has seemed wise to retain all that is characteristic , all that reveals the intricacies of actual production , rather than to strive for a rigid uniformity . In keeping with the plan of this series of volumes , scholarly apparatus which would encumber the text or the introduction has been , so far as possible , avoided . Aside from fugitive material , clippings , programs , etc. , in various collections and libraries , the following books , to which in lieu of textual documentation the editor now makes acknowledgment , have provided the bulk of information for the introductory essay : T.

" And the introduction to a series of hitherto unpublished plays is not unlike the old prologue to a first performance in the theater , though the present writer hastily disavows poetic intention . The play 's the thing , after all , and the world is much more interested , and rightly so , in what has been achieved rather than in how it was achieved or why . The plays are their own excuse for being , and must interpret their own existence . Nevertheless since fashions change and become strange and sometimes incomprehensible to later generations , it may not be amiss to remove certain veils which hamper the vision and obtrude between the thing done and our understanding of it . When Henry Churchill De Mille came to New York from his North Carolina birthplace , it was with the intention of becoming a clergyman . Somewhere during the process of his further education at Columbia , he decided on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.B . in 1875 , took a position at Lockwood Academy , Brooklyn , while he pursued work for his master 's degree . This completed , he joined the staff of the Columbia College Grammar School , where he took active part in the writing and production of plays for amateurs . Meanwhile the Madison Square Theatre had been rebuilt by Steele MacKaye , the Frohmans had been engaged as touring and business managers , and in 1882 David Belasco became stage manager . De Mille 's abilities having attracted some attention , he was offered and accepted the position of playreader at the Madison Square , and his subsequent career in the theater remained closely tied with these early associates . At the Madison Square Theatre , De Mille 's work burst into feverish activity . He is reported , for example , to have examined two hundred manuscripts in three months , besides assisting in the revision of many of the pieces produced . Nevertheless he found time to write his first play for the professional theater . John Delmer 's Daughters ; or , Duty , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and completed after many interruptions in February of the following year . It was produced under Belasco 's direction on December 10 , 1883 , with the following cast : Dr. Van Arnem Walden Ramsay John Delmer W. J. Le Moyne Martha Delmer Mrs. Thomas Whiffen Margaret Fanny Reeves Esther Enid Leslie Rhoda Manly Marie Burroughs Dr. Leonard West George Clarke Paley Pomeroy Thomas Whiffen The play , which deals with the domestic infelicity caused by a mother-in-law and her family of social climbers who are humbled as felicity is restored , was not liked by either audience or critics and was withdrawn after a week 's run , a failure somewhat conspicuous in a theater which had had so many successes . De Mille stayed on at the Madison Square , reading and revising plays , even doing a bit of acting after A. M. Palmer was called in to bolster the Mallory policies , while Steele MacKaye , his control lost , dreamed his dream of a new and better theater and a theater school , realized it in the Lyceum , and surrendered , disheartened , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , which became the American Academy of Dramatic Arts , and make his reputation as a playwright at the Lyceum Theatre in collaboration with David Belasco under the managership of Daniel Frohman , whose playreader he became . The first De Mille play which Frohman presented at the Lyceum Theatre , however , was not written with Belasco , who staged it , but with Charles Barnard , long connected with Scribner 's Monthly and now best remembered as the author of The County Fair with and for Neil Burgess . Perhaps uncomfortably aware of his previous failure in serious comedy , De Mille with Barnard concocted a straight melodrama of a familiar and favorite variety , The Mean Line ; or , Rawson 's Y , with which Frohman reopened the Lyceum Theatre on September 18 , 1886 .

De Mille Dora Van Tyne Lilian Richardson Little Prairie Flower Dora Stuart Positive Burroughs Etta Hawkins De Mille , it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden indisposition of W. H. Crompton , who was to have played Sam Burroughs ; the playwright later assumed the part of Jim Blakely on the road . This " purely American play ... played before a large audience , and made a success " ( Herald ) , indeed " the success was emphatic " ( Sun ) , and " The Main Line will pay big dividends " ( Times ) . The World called it " a pretty and picturesque play , plenteously adorned with character painting , abounding in clever dialogue ... , a series of strong dramatic pictures , all carefully colored and skilfully arranged to increase and intensify the interest as the story progresses . " The Herald , however , said it was " not a play of a very high order of merit " and " built on most trite dramatic lines , " and the Spirit of the Times agrees that it is " an old story " and " of no value as a drama . " All the reviewers acquiesced enthusiastically over the railroad effects , " for which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the thrilling third act climax which was greeted , " with tremendous applause " ( Tribune ) and " has become the talk of the town " ( Telegram ) . The acting , staging , and scenic effects were generally praised , but there was some doubt as to the propriety of Puddychump 's " spiritual paraphrases mixed with very unworldly actions " ( Herald ) , and the Spirit of the Times counsels Mr. De Mille to " let the Bible alone on the stage . " The Main Line played at the Lyceum uninterruptedly until October 16th , and then with the cast somewhat altered went on the road . Chicago , Philadelphia , Boston , and doubtless other cities saw it in the succeeding months . The Madison Square Company revived it in New York on April 25 , 1887 , for a week 's run at the People 's Theatre , and it was at the Windsor a year later . Thereafter for a time it was almost ubiquitous : Chicago , for example , had four productions at four different theaters within the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play for Rosabel Morrison who produced it under the title , The Danger Signal , at the People 's Theatre on September 7th , and thereafter toured in it with her own company . In this revision the characters were given new names and occupations , the heroine becoming Rose Martin , " the Wild Flower of Laramie Bend , " and there was introduced for the first time " a scene representing a snow blockade in the Rocky Mountains , the realistic effect being greatly heightened by the passage across the stage of a full-sized locomotive and a ' cyclone ' rotary snow plough " ( Herald ) . References chronicle performances of The Danger Signal in New York and elsewhere until about 1895 , and local stock companies throughout the country no doubt kept it alive much longer . Meanwhile , during the early summer of 1887 , Daniel Frohman , gathering a permanent company for the first regular stock season at the Lyceum Theatre , cast about for a modern society play which would exhibit its talents . Finding nothing satisfactory elsewhere , he turned to the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they collaborate . Belasco and De Mille agreed with alacrity , and shortly thereafter retired to De Mille 's summer home at Echo Lake to work on the play which , first christened The Marriage Tie , ultimately became The Wife . The collaborators finally decided to build around a situation earlier used by Belasco in The Millionaire 's Daughter , in which a husband , instead of divorcing his wife when he discovers her indiscretion , behaves with understanding kindness and eventually wins her love . Ultimately the situation derived from The Banker 's Daughter by Bronson Howard , whose other plays also contributed much to the De Mille-Belasco collaborations . Armed with notes and bits of dialogue for this scene , they consulted Frohman , who approved enthusiastically , and then began the process of creating rles to fit the stock company . The leading parts , for example , were tailored to suit the womanly Georgia Cayvan and the manly and dignified Herbert Kelcey . Since they were working against time , the authors had to decide in advance the location of the scenes which they were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production . The De Mille-Belasco collaborations were playwrought before they were playwritten . Except for experimental snatches , dialogue was held in abeyance until character had been conceived and developed and situations devised and arranged in elaborate detail . Most of the actual writing was done by De Mille , most of the planning and dramatic construction by Belasco . The preliminary discussions over and the development of the action clear in their minds , the two men repaired to the theater and staged the play . De Mille sat at a table in the front row of the orchestra ; Belasco on the stage impersonated all the characters in the situations which had been plotted . Such dialogue as had been written down was primarily a point of departure , a means by which the situations were set in motion . The dialogue which emerged in final form sprang less from the preliminary speeches than from the situations in action ; the determining factor was stage effectiveness . De Mille would read a few lines ; Belasco would set them in motion , suggest alterations , omissions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be acted but to suit the acting . For example , since entrances and exits had already been carefully timed , Belasco would come upon the stage in character at R.2.E. as planned , start across to stage L. , see an imaginary character down C. , and come slowly downstage . De Mille would then devise a speech to fit the given situation , which would allow the character Belasco was impersonating to make these transitions . This done , and always bearing in mind the actor who was to play that part , Belasco would try it on the stage , time it , and approve or suggest changes . The speech finally determined upon was the result of this kind of collaboration . After this manner were all the De Mille-Belasco plays wrought , De Mille 's literary ability combining with Belasco 's almost miraculous stage management to form the completed scripts . The Wife was first presented at the Lyceum Theatre on November 1 , 1887 , and revealed the Frohman stock company as follows : John Rutherford Herbert Kelcey Matthew Culver Nelson Wheatcroft Robert Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. J. Le Moyne Jack Dexter Charles S. Dickson Mr. Randolph W. C. Bellows Helen Truman Georgia Cayvan Lucile Ferrant Grace Henderson Mrs. S. Bellamy Ives Mrs. Charles Walcot Kitty Ives Louise Dillon Mrs. Amory Mrs. Thomas Whiffen Agnes Vida Croly William Faversham , understudying Henry Miller , assumed the part of Robert Gray for one week of the run . Since the reviews were unanimous in praise of the company , the acting , the staging , and the scenery , it is hardly necessary to quote them ; " success " was plainly written in or between the lines . On the play itself , however , there was some difference of opinion . Both the Sun and the Herald thought it " well written , " the latter " encouraging for American dramatic literature . " " A good play of American life , " it goes on , " serious in its purpose , yet with its emotional scenes relieved by pleasant comedy ... well written and quick in action , the interest never being allowed to flag . Its characters are well drawn and its atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is improbable in its interesting story and it is well constructed . " To the Times , on the other hand , " the vital force of the new play ... is all in its third act . " As a whole it is " pretty , " " coherent , wholesome , and sensible , " but " the characters are not all strongly drawn " ; " it is not a great play , and it may not be remembered after it has run its first course . " Belasco himself was disappointed : " I knew , even before production , " he said , " that it was too long and too loosely jointed . " But he had faith in the play , even though after a short time the directors of the theater ordered it withdrawn , and he and De Mille set about the onerous task of revision during production . The first two acts of what had been originally a five-act play were telescoped into one . Surgery mended Major Putnam 's limp and increased the pace of his scenes . Grace Henderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience was deceived in her character , so her machinations were revealed by an aside : " Robert Gray  --  I will bring you back to me  --  no matter what the price . " Day after day , De Mille and Belasco cut the play , and soon the receipts began to pick up , until there was no possible doubt that The Wife , like the company and the production , was a triumphant success . It was given two hundred and thirty-nine consecutive performances , ending its run on June 16 , 1888 ; the debts of the theater were paid in full ; and De Mille and Belasco were commissioned to write a new play for the following season . Indication of the subsequent popularity of The Wife can be gauged by its stage history . The next season the Lyceum Theatre Company took it on tour through the major theatrical centers , Chicago , Boston , etc . It was back in New York for a week at the Grand Opera House beginning December 10th , at the Star with a somewhat changed cast for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People 's Theatre for the week of April 8th . With the original players it was revived at the Lyceum on April 29th ; it ran until May 18th , when the theater closed for the season . The following September , after playing in Chicago , the Lyceum company opened Oscar Hammerstein 's new Harlem Opera House with a week 's performances of The Wife , and went again on the road for repetitions in Boston . The regular Lyceum company was still acting it on tour in the fall of 1891 , but soon after this the play became a vehicle for many stock companies , and to trace their productions would be fruitless . Suffice it to say that New York audiences could see the play in 1890 , 1891 , 1893 , 1900 , and as late as 1915 ; and Chicago , which is a representative stock city , witnessed performances in 1891 , 1892 , 1893 , 1895 , 1896 ( at four theaters ) , 1897 , 1899 , 1900 , 1902 , 1904 , 1906 , and 1907 . As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stock list of the American Play Company , which had rentals to stock companies until the World War and to amateurs well into the third decade of this century . Under the title of The Senator 's Wife the play was presented at the Theatre Royal , Manchester , on September 30 , 1892 . A version of The Wife in the New York Public Library was rewritten by Belasco for Charles Wyndham , with the scene and characters becoming English . The new play upon which De Mille and Belasco were to collaborate was to be designed for E. H. Sothern , who had made a popular success for Frohman in The Highest Bidder . Since his father 's most famous character had been Dundreary , the playwrights decided almost at once to make the hero an English lord , and at the same time to avoid the " silly ass " traits so characteristic of the stage Englishman in America . His name was to be Cholmondeley , pronounced and finally spelled , except in the dramatis personae , " Chumley . " From the character were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations , with love scenes and bright lines . Our real task was to exploit a comedian . " For some time they whipped their powers of invention to no avail ; finally a simple incident gave them the necessary impetus . In the village near Echo Lake , Belasco had bought a pistol cigarette-holder intending to give it to De Mille 's children . On a walk with De Mille he playfully pulled it from his pocket with the words , " Stand and deliver , " and thereby was conceived part of the first act . Other bits came with variations from Not Such a Fool as He Looks , Still Waters Run Deep , A Bachelor of Arts , and Rosedale . By July 1888 , the preliminary work was complete , but Sothern , who had originally approved , now was wary of the character and did not wish to play it . The Horrified authors saw all their work for nought , since Chumley had been devised for Sothern and would fit no one else . Fortunately he was finally convinced , and joined Belasco on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to put the play in complete form . The feather duster business in Act II grew out of an accident at rehearsal , when Sothern , unexpectedly tickled , started up with a shout of alarm ; juxtaposed with Lady Adeline 's praise of Chumley 's bravery , it made an amusing and effective incident . Rehearsals over , Lord Chumley opened at the Lyceum Theatre on August 20 , 1888 . By the very nature of the play , Sothern somewhat dwarfed the rest of the actors : Adam Butterworth C. B. Bishop Lieutenant Hugh Butterworth Frank Carlyle Gasper Le Sage Herbert Archer Tommy Tucker Rowland Buckstone Blink Blunk George Backus Winterbottom A. W. Gregory Eleanor Belle Archer Jessie Deane Dora Leslie Lady Adeline Barker Fannie Addison Meg Etta Hawkins Miranda Rosa Starke Lord George Cholmondeley , known as " Chumley " E. H. Sothern The Times , for example , in a long review , mentioned not a single member of the cast except Sothern . Practically all the critics recognized the eclectic nature of the play , and considered it , as it was intended , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was " clever and ingenious " ( Herald ) . " The action ... moves briskly and pleasantly " and " there is an agreeable strain of wit in the dialogue " ( Times ) . In short , " Sothern 's triumph was the chief feature , but the play was also successful " ( Post ) . There was nothing but praise for the chief actor and no doubt whatever that this " production of extraordinary merit " ( Mail and Express ) " will draw large and merry audiences to the Lyceum for months " ( Telegram ) ; indeed " it promises to last young Sothern as long as ' Dundreary ' lasted his father " ( Press ) . " The audience was keen , appreciative , and amused , and with Boucicault applauding from the boxes and Harrigan from the stalls , the comedians must have felt the honor of the approbation of the masters of their art .... The cheers were constant and repeated and the evening an ovation " ( Herald ) . Lord Chumley closed at the Lyceum on November 10th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began a nationwide tour by opening at the Hollis Street Theatre , Boston , two days later , with minor changes in the cast . The Lyceum greeted Sothern 's now famous character again at the opening of the next theatrical season on August 20 , 1889 ; the play ran until October 19th , reappeared at the Harlem Opera House the week of October 28th , and again sought the road . Nor was the Lyceum through with it yet : twice more Sothern appeared there as Chumley for short runs beginning October 29 , 1894 , and October 25 , 1897 . There were revivals also at the Harlem Opera House in 1895 and 1898 , and at the Grand Opera House in 1898 , at about which time Sothern dropped the part after playing it off and on for ten years all over the country . I note , for example , performances in St. Louis in at least five separate years , and in Chicago in another five . After Sothern relinquished it , the play was taken up by stock companies and was seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1925 it became the basis of a motion picture entitled Forty Winks . With the success of Lord Chumley , it was a foregone conclusion that De Mille and Belasco would continue their collaboration and provide a new play for the Lyceum Theatre for the third time in three successive years . Their summer 's work at Echo Lake resulted in a script distinctly for the stock company rather than a star , The Charity Ball . As in The Wife they began with a social theme , but details are lacking with regard to the immediate provenance of the play . It was apparently built around the strong situation in the third act in which a clergyman marries to his self-indulgent brother the girl he himself has fallen in love with . The necessity of having the leading lady , Georgia Cayvan , in this act , caused the introduction of the David Copperfield theme and the reconstruction of the authors ' original plan . I surmise that the treatment of human infirmity , made more effective by relating it to general social benevolence , led to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene in the Metropolitan Opera House . The play opened at the Lyceum Theatre on November 19 , 1889 , with a cast of exceptional ability : John Van Buren Herbert Kelcey Dick Van Buren Nelson Wheatcroft Judge Peter Gurney Knox W. J. Le Moyne Franklin Cruger Charles Walcot Mr. Creighton Harry Allen Alec Robinson Fritz Williams Mr. Betts R. J. Dustan Paxton Walter C. Bellows Cain Ada Terry Madison Jasper Percy West Ann Cruger Georgia Cayvan Phyllis Lee Grace Henderson Bess Van Buren Effie Shannon Mrs. Camilla de Peyster Mrs. Charles Walcot Mrs. Van Buren Mrs. Thomas Whiffen Sophie Millie Dowling And for the third time there was no doubt whatever that the collaborators had provided the theater with another hit . The reviews are monotonously alike : " Will be a success " ( Telegram ) , " Will hold the stage throughout the season " ( Tribune ) , " Will prove as popular as ' The Wife ' " ( Post ) , " Will be even more successful than ' The Wife ' " ( Spirit of the Times ) , " Has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , of the last act : " The interest ... ended in the third , " said the Herald , and suggested pruning ; but the Times dubbed it " a better play of its kind than ' The Wife , ' and it will not need to be rewritten . " It undoubtedly was revised , however , for though it lasted until almost midnight on its opening , later advertisements time its final curtain at 10:50 . Part of its success was no doubt due to the " pathos and sentiment of the play which are fine and impressive " ( Mail ) , to the " fun which is plentiful , " and " the wonderfully lifelike " third act ( Times ) ; some to the acting and " beautiful stage pictures " ( Star ) : " At every point the eye beheld visions lovely , graceful , picturesque " ( Evening Sun ) . At any rate the play ran until May 24 , 1890 , closing at the Lyceum after its two hundredth performance . By the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters , first of course by the Lyceum group , later by other stock companies . If Chicago be a proper index , it was more popular on the road and with local companies than any other De Mille-Belasco play . Programs record performances elsewhere as late as 1915 . Before the first run of The Charity Ball was over , David Belasco , at odds with the stockholders , severed his connection with the Lyceum . Meanwhile F. F. Proctor had torn down a church un 23rd Street and erected a theater . Charles Frohman , eager for his own stock company , leased it , and turned to his old associate , Belasco , to provide a play . " I was strongly tempted , " Belasco tells us , " to write the opening play alone , but when I saw how much depended upon it , I had a touch of stage fright . Naturally , my thoughts turned to Henry De Mille .... We had always been successful because our way of thought was similar and we were frank in our criticism of each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit . The emotional or dramatic scenes were more to my liking . I acted while he took down my speeches . When a play was finished , it was impossible to say where his work left off and mine began .... It was five o'clock in the morning when I was seized with the idea of asking De Mille to assist me and I hastened at once to his house . I knocked on the door with the vigor of a watchman sounding a fire alarm , and when De Mille at last appeared he was armed with a cane , ready to defend his hearth and home . I told him of the necessity of a play for ' C. F. 's ' opening and he agreed to work with me . In the profession De Mille and I were thought to be very lucky as ' theater openers . ' ... Here we were again ... talking over the birth and baptism of yet another New York manager . " As a matter of fact the theater had been " opened " a year earlier , and Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first play for the stock company . Men and Women , the last play in which De Mille and Belasco collaborated , grew out of a current bank scandal . A young man had speculated with bank funds to which , as an employee , he had access ; his father 's determination to restore the money , and save the bank and his son received considerable publicity . The title was selected to indicate universal appeal and breadth of theme . To this end also , more sets of lovers than usual are included in the plot . Information for the climactic third act , which was the raison d ' tre of the play , came from a friendly cashier . The part of Dora was created for Maude Adams in whom Charles Frohman saw great possibilities . She had briefly appeared for Daniel Frohman as Jessie Deane in Lord Chumley . The part of Mrs. Jane Prescott was written for her mother . The entire cast for the first performance at Proctor 's Twenty-third Street Theatre on October 21 , 1890 , was as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seabury Orrin Johnson Mr. Pendleton Leslie Allen Mr. Reynolds W. H. Tillard Mr. Bergman Arthur Hayden Mr. Wayne Edgar Mackey Calvin Stedman R. A. Roberts Lyman H. Webb Henry Talbot Stephen Rodman Frank Mordaunt Colonel Zachary T. Kip M. A. Kennedy Dr. " Dick " Armstrong T. C. Valentine Sam Delafield J. C. Buckstone Arnold Kirke Emmett Corrigan District Messenger No. 81 Master Louis Haines Roberts A. R. Newton John Richard Marlow Agnes Rodman Sydney Armstrong Dora Maude Adams Mrs. Kate Delafield Odette Tyler Margery Knox Etta Hawkins Mrs. Jane Prescott Annie Adams Mrs. Kirke Lillian Chantore Lucy Winona Shannon Julia Gladys Eurelle If De Mille and Belasco were considered lucky " openers , " certainly Men and Women did nothing to vitiate that claim . The play ran two hundred and four consecutive performances , closing on March 28 , 1891 , and admirably vindicated the prophecies of success made by the reviewers after the dbut . The critic in the Herald , it is true , becoming increasingly annoyed at the obvious similarity between the plays by the collaborators , " the same sugary sentiment , the same hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with considerable vigor . " The first half of the third act , marred though it is by flagrant tricks and absurdities , is unquestionably strong , " but otherwise he will have none of it . " The rest of the play is chiefly noticeable for its lack of invention and its deliberate disregard of the laws of stage construction .... The dialogue ... is unreal or trite . There are twice as many people in the play as there should be , and they all talk too much . The plot is involved , and the authors have made the usual blunders of diverting the interest of their audiences from their main story to a host of subsidiary incidents . Lastly their fourth act is superfluous . " No , not lastly , for why should a Jew have in his library a stained glass representation of Christ and the Magdalen ? Nevertheless , " it will pay , for it appeals to a class of simple-minded playgoers , who will be taken in by its artifice . " Some of the basis of this criticism , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six of the original characters were dropped or telescoped : Congressman Kip , for example , was retired , and became bank examiner , thereby eliminating Lyman H. Webb who had had that function . No doubt other revisions brought further simplification . But except in its estimate of success , the Herald is practically alone in its views . The World thought it " worthy , " the Star the " best they have ever written , " and the Journal , the Press , and the Commercial Advertiser agreed that it ranked among the best of recent American plays . In the flood of importations , the Times , too , is thankful that " this is a play by American authors , treating of an American subject . " Men and Women was equally successful on the tours which immediately followed . It had two runs in Chicago , a stay of a month in Boston , and penetrated to San Francisco before the year was out . It was at both the Grand and Harlem Opera Houses the following season ; it repeated at the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1894 . Later New York representations occurred in 1899 . There were ten one-week stands in Chicago from 1892 to 1906 . The William Morris Stock Company played it in 1907 . In 1925 the playwright 's son , William C. de Mille , directed a motion picture version . Belasco was in 1891 primarily occupied with the presentation of Mrs. Leslie Carter , and thereafter was more interested in writing plays for stars than for stock . With the success of Men and Women , it was natural therefore for Charles Frohman to turn to De Mille alone for a new play for his company . It seems likely that De Mille had witnessed the presentation in German of Ludwig Fulda 's Das verlorene Paradies at the Amberg Theatre in December of 1890 . At any rate , Fulda 's play , which had been first presented on November 1st of that year in Berlin , was not published until two years later . After negotiation with the author , De Mille set about making an adaptation of this play . Since his completed work and Fulda 's play are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present editor 's plan to discuss the relationship in detail , though it became a matter of some controversy . However , De Mille 's views on the subject are of some importance , since they reveal his method of workmanship ; they are contained in a letter in the Harvard Theatre Collection : " I will allow any fair minded man to read the two plays and judge if I have not done more than adapt . Suppose we have a birthday table in both plays , I make a totally different use of it . Suppose we have a superintendent in both . My ' Warner ' is no more like Fulda 's ' Arndt ' than Julius Caesar is like Coriolanus . But I need not particularize . I have used as many lines as I could find suitable to my purpose , from the German , but I am willing to swear that of the 16,000 words that my play contains , not 2,000 are Fulda 's , if indeed there are one thousand . Though I say it myself , the good points of Fulda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is hard to believe that the plot is not all his . The N.Y . Mirror correspondent in quoting evidences of German thought , in every instance took lines that were not in the German at all , but were entirely original with me . For example the lines from one of the workmen , ' The drops of sweat from our bodies crystallize into diamonds to hang around her neck . ' While there is a strike and an interview with the owner , in the German play , the arguments that my workmen use , are my own , or rather Henry George 's . I only write thus at all , to show you , that in defending me , you are on the right side . I will never claim for mine what is not . But I will fight for what I am justly entitled to , till the stars fall . Why apart from the labor theme , the plots or the two plays are entirely different . In the German , the superintendent is not in love with the owner 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you know , is the main feature of my play , to which the labor question is subordinate . I will ask you to examine simply the last acts of the two plays . No , my dear fellow , I am the author of ' The Lost Paradise , ' and were I to state that the play owed more than its first suggestion to the German , I should be telling a lie , and doing myself a great injustice at the same time . " The Charles Frohman Stock Company was now on its way back from the coast , and De Mille joined it at Denver to begin rehearsals of The Lost Paradise . It was first performed at the Columbia Theatre , Chicago , on August 17 , 1891 , where it ran for two weeks . The reviews were highly laudatory : " Play , author , and company scored an undeniable success " ( Herald ) ; " Realistic and effective , enthusiastic reception " ( Times ) ; " ' The Wife , ' ' The Charity Ball ' do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dramatic construction , absolute breadth of idea , or deep undercurrent of human interest " ( Inter-Ocean ) . The Tribune , too , praises this " new play by a representative American dramatist ... one of the most talented of contemporary playwrights .... The love interest is skillfully blended with the deep , serious motive ... ' The Lost Paradise ' is a sterling American drama which has great capabilities for good . It is a play with a profound motive and a moral which every thoughtful auditor will take home with him . " The following Sunday the same critic treated the play at some length , pointing out that though Mr. De Mille 's aim was to develop a love story , and incidentally to treat the conflict between work and wealth , it is the latter which is more impressive and which provides " one of the greatest scenes on the stage . " He regrets only that the play is not " entirely original . " The Lost Paradise opened in New York at Proctor 's Twenty-third Street Theatre on November 16 , 1891 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended its run on March 5th . Among the many fine performances , it is worth noting that this was Maude Adams 's first decisive New York success : Andrew Knowlton Frank Mordaunt Reuben Warner William Morris Ralph Standish Orrin Johnson Bob Appleton Cyril Scott Fletcher Leslie Allen Joe Barrett Henry Talbot Schwarz Thomas Oberle Bensel Emmett Corrigan Hyatt Charles Matlack Billy Hopkins J.C . Buckstone Mrs. Knowlton Annie Adams Margaret Knowlton Sydney Armstrong Polly Fletcher Odette Tyler Julia Mary Croxton Nell Maude Adams Cinders Etta Hawkins Kate Bijou Fernandez " It is , " said the Herald , " one of the few interesting works that we have seen in our day which treat a great and modern theme in a broad and earnest way . The theme is the great struggle between capital and labor . It was handled in a strong and human way by Herr Fulda , and Mr. De Mille has kept all that was good in the original version , supplementing it with humor of an honest kind and largely developing the love interest .... It deserves a long and prosperous career . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston in January 1892 , before the conclusion of its New York run . It played nine New York theaters before the end of the century , several more in the next decade ; it was produced in London in December 1802 ; in Chicago , it was still being acted in 1909 , and in smaller cities stock companies no doubt continued to play it even later . In a curtain speech at the first New York performance of The Lost Paradise , Henry De Mille remarked that the enthusiasm with which the play had been greeted indicated that the public would stand plays which made them think as well as feel . The playwright 's interest in social and economic themes is evidenced by his treatment of politics in The Wife , of speculation and poverty in The Charity Ball , of banking and prison in Men and Women . Nevertheless , though he plainly had strong opinions on these subjects , they were always in the background of the plays in which he collaborated with David Belasco . They furnish motives out of which to devise situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In The Lost Paradise , however , though he confesses that the social problem is not the " main feature , " his very choice of Fulda 's play as his source shows his growing conviction that the thoughtful treatment of American conditions was an important part of the playwright 's function , that the theater should not merely provide amusement but offer opportunities for the serious study of the world in which we live . This conviction was undoubtedly fostered , as has already been indicated in the letter quoted , by acquaintance with the work of Henry George . Reading Progress and Poverty aloud to his family , he was deeply impressed both with the beauty of its style and diction , and with its economic argument and spiritual fervor . Accordingly he wrote George a letter in which he expressed enthusiasm for his doctrines , and stated his own dramatic intentions . This letter , and the answer to it , are now printed for the first time : " Pompton , N.J. " July 19th 1892 " My dear Mr. George : " No-one can read your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Box of Pandora  --  and particularly the latter part , in which you show that the moral law coincides with the economic ; no-one can feel the heart throb , that pulsates through every line for the woes of mankind ; no-one can witness and sympathize with the fortitude of that faith which induces a man to take up God 's banner in a cause which nothing but faith shows him is not lost ; no-one , in short , could have written the concluding chapter of ' Progress and Poverty , ' and think it an unnecessary act on the part of a reader and faithful student , to drop you just this word of assurance , that the seed is not all thrown upon stony ground . " I believe God , in his good time has placed your book in my hands  --  In my hands do I say ? He has done more . He has placed it in my heart . Its principles are what I have dimly and confusedly been stumbling toward , over the wrecks of political economics , systems , and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most practical demonstration of two truths  --  ' God is Love ' and ' The laborer is worthy of his hire '  --  that have been my sheet anchor since the time I began to read God 's word as expressed in his tables of stone , the stones of the earth and in the tables of the hearts of those holy men of old , who spake as they were moved by the Sacred Spirit . It does seem to me that , as Paul says , ' in these latter times also God has spoken to us . ' " I was struck by the title of the Duke of Argyll 's essay  --  ' The Prophet of San Francisco . ' How unconsciously our enemies speak the truth sometimes . ' Nazarene ' was spoken as a term of reproach . It is rather a proud title now for one to wear . " I believe that a prophet has spoken ; that a man inspired with the truth of God 's Kingdom and an appreciation of his Kingship wrote the words of ' Progress and Poverty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of a word of cheer to the toilers in the cause of light , and the comfort it brings to one in the advance guard , where the stones are sharpest and the briars thickest , and the way darkest , that another recruit has joined the band of strugglers , another has started to raise his feeble torch to illumine the way . When I had read the first half of ' Progress and Poverty , ' I wrote ( with the aid of my German suggester ) ' The Lost Paradise . ' I then went on to the solution and the warning which I shall make the subject of my next play , and circumstances permitted me to finish the reading of your book . In it I found my text . If I can make the dramatic sermon approach anywhere near the dignity , clearness , and grandeur of the text book , I shall feel that I have truly done God 's work . " That I never do anything by halves , and am half hearted in no cause that I embrace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your Friend ( for so I can sign myself after reading the book ) and Admirer , " Henry C. De Mille . " " Merriwold Park " Monticello , " N.Y . " My dear Mr. De Mille : " You will understand better I think than I can tell you how glad I am to receive the kind notes from Mrs. De Mille and yourself . " I speak what I know , and what many others will testify to when I say that you will never regret having thrown yourself into the good cause . It will make life higher and happier and the thought of death easier . And now the time has come when every effort shows its result . You have power to reach those whom I can not , and may pass the torch to those who will carry far further than you could reach . I am glad of your coming . We have needed you , for the field is ripe , and from the bottom of my heart I wish you , God speed ! " You and I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given to us  --  that of doing our part to make its coming sure . " With many thanks for your kindness in Writing to me , and with earnest congratulations to Mrs. De Mille as well as to yourself , I am " Sincerely yours , " Henry George " The new play in which De Mille was to treat " the solution and the warning " was to be called The Promised Land . There is little doubt that it would have marked an important stage in the playwright 's career , a stage for which , in a sense , all else had been preparation . But while The Promised Land was still in the form of rough notes , Henry De Mille died at his home in Pompton on February 10 , 1893 . The plays included in this volume offer a satisfactory indication of what was popular in the American theater towards the end of the nineteenth century . It is easy from our vantage point of the present day to smile knowingly at what is old-fashioned in them , to criticize the formula upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to formula , but to judge them properly we must see them in relation to the times and conditions for which they were written . The factor which determined the nature of these plays was the stock company . For that purpose they were admirably suited . They gave great and enduring pleasure to a large number of people . Moreover , Henry De Mille would have gone much farther , had he not died before he was forty years old . Even so , he left " A land of promise , a land of memory , " A COMPLETE LIST OF THE PLAYS BY HENRY C.
