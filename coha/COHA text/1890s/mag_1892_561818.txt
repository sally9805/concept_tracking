txt O1*rE of the most curious and unexpected facts for mothers in France-one which has brought about within the last twenty-five years an actual revolution that is having its effect upon our customs-has been the emancipation of our young girls , caused by the intercourse of young women in France with American and English girls . What is most surprising and strange in it all is that education has not brought about this change . Convents and schools have the same rules and teach the same principles , without modifications of any kind . The religious faith of young women has remained the same , and the peculiar result is that those who are generally the most independent affect , or really feel , the necessity of practising their religious duties in the most scrupulous manner . French girls have all along observed religious conventions more closely as they assumed a more independent bearing . Formerly , a young woman did assume a slight independence of spirit , or become a little more skeptical and filled with a little more of the Voltaire school , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the more untrammelled mind of her husband . To-day , she places herself in touch with ideas which she believes to be of a better ton , just as fast as her opinion of the old French manners and customs decreases . Do not imagine that these deep seated changes in the make-np of the character of young French women have come about in a single class of society or in Paris alone . The same modifications have appeared in the provinces , in the smallest towns and in the most retired castles , in exactly the same proportion as where they had the largest path to make . You see , for instance , young women escorting each other , riding horseback alone , going out with a maid or a governess , without their mothers ; and they go out with // their brothers , too . They are to be found at receptions , where they are announced , where young men come to seek them , though their mothers do not appear . They even go out with an unmarried escort no older than themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the life at watering-places , at the seaside resorts and especially at places along the Mediterranean . I well remember the first time my little daughter-she was then ten years old , and was playing near me with a little French friend no older than herself-saw , from the balcony of the house in which we lived in the English Quarter at Cannes , a young English girl pass by in the direction of the Esterel escorted by a young man . My daughter said to her little companion : " There goes an English girl out walking with her brother . " And the other with an inimitable air answered : " No , dear , perhaps it is n't her brother . Perhaps it 's only her friend . " " What ! Her friend ! Not even her father ? " " Not even her father . " " But , " cried my daughter , as much scandalized as one so young could be , " do her mamma and papa allow her to go out alone at her age on the mountain with a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She is the daughter of a lord , " replied the little friend , quickly , " I am sure ; I know her . " " Mamma , is what Lunette says true ? " demanded my child of me . " Do you think that proper-you , who are grown up ? " " No , no , " I replied , " and I hope that the fashion will never be adopted in France. ** To-day my daughter 's daughters have the manners and customs which have undergone these new changes , and they are Anglicized and Americanized like their friends . Nothing can give an idea  --  and I speak with knowledge , as one who has suffered-of the revulsion of feeling which a mother experienced twenty-five years ago at Nice , at Hy*res , at Mentone , at Cannes , when she saw English girls go out alone with a " friend , " as Lunette said , or , dividing into couples , go off in large numbers on excursions from which they did not return until evening . It was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that these young girls , who , after all , had mothers , should run such danger ! Although , indeed , when one looked more carefully // and saw the great boobies whose awkward style and long steps the English girls copied , and who seemed to have taken away from the girls all the French modesty . and much-scorned exclusiveness , one could reassure oneself . Our children , as they grew up , were still shocked beyond all expression at what they called the want of style and the want of manners of the English . In social circles the camp of young French girls was never allowed to mix under any circumstances with the camp of American and English girls . There were whisperings of mockery on one side and the other , ironical pity for the slavery of the one , scandal at the " boyish " mauners of the other . There was something like a state of warfare between them , and the young men of both parties rarely took the risk of inviting a girl from the other clan . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to American girls , but they compromised themselves in the minds of their sisters and friends . Our girls rather exaggerated their reserve , and it seemed as if they affected the plan of shielding themselves under our wing . In vain would a young man propose a walk on his arm in the drawing-room to a young French girl . Her indignation would break forth in , " Ah , Monsieur , am I an American or English woman ? " Our girls , for instance , who were wellbred never looked their partner in the face while dancing , and would reply with modesty to his compliments , or blush at each word that seemed to them unfit for their womanly ears . They would stop the conversation with , " Monsieur , I beg of you not to continue . I have heard too much already that was not meant for me to hear . " Indeed , our young girls had a respect for their own innocence that made them reject all knowledge , all comprehension of anything that might disturb their purity or make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy . They would have suffered , if they had guessed anything their parents hid from them , and would have considered that they were guilty in understanding it . Their minds were shielded by their parents and their friends , and the latter were careful in their presence . A word was sufficient to make them pass quickly over a dangerous subject . " Do not forget that there are some young girls here "  --  and the story would be stopped short . Everything , as I say , was done to keep the thoughts of young girls on poetic , gay , and juvenile subjects . VOL CLIV. - NO. 425. 29 // Facts about nature and science were only revealed to them when they had to be initiated into certain mysteries of life . A young woman who studied botany became a curiosity the moment when she pronounced certain words . Ornithology was the most accepted science , because it was useful to mothers at the time of marriage for certain necessary revelations . The nests and the little birds gave a poetic turn to talks that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how many girls have been frightened and unnerved at these revelations , and how they would have fled to the far ends of the earth if they had dared , rather than contract a marriage , as Monsieur le Maire says ! Our young women , whether of the higher or the lower nobility , of the peasantry or the tradespeople , lived in a complete and ethereal ignorance . They did not know evil . It is quite true that they were not armed to guard or defend themselves , and they were often thrown into marriage unprepared , because of scruples and hesitations only too common on the part of mothers , who have not the slightest suspicions of the consequences ; and they were as often indignant and disgusted by the exigencies . On the other hand , a young girl who opposed her family in a reasonable marriage with no other pretext than that the aspirant did not please her was nuanimously censured . " Mademoiselle wishes to choose , herself , to marry , herself , " they would repeat with severity . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents know better than she what will suit her ? She is a girl who will come to no good . " Then , a young girl never read any papers but fashion papers . Her educational books were examined , carefully looked over and expurgated . Even her dreams were classic ; they must have been ideal in the extreme , and nothing material could have been imagined by her , nothing but a platonic husband promised her in life . It was not proper to have too good health , either , or too much appetite , if she would be a really aristocratic young woman . And we brought up this child so pure , to be wedded to a French husband who was already beginning to bite at all kinds of sports , to think only of amusing himself in every way , growing more and more jeering and sceptical , respecting very few things in life , loving pleasure above all , good living and an outdoor life ! How many of our young girls have returned , forever unhappy , to cower on the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4t51 to a friend married even as they were ! How many have sought refuge for their wounded spirits with a priest , who counselled them to guard their souls for Go*jl , and not to yield them to a husband who had not tried in any wayAo conquer them ! The masculine nature became odious to certain too innocent wives ; marriage remains in their minds as a sort of ambush into which they had been thrown without warning . It was , therefore , necessary to prepare our daughters better for our Sons , to give them better instruction in the materialistic and prosaic sides of life , to initiate them into the sciences which should show how all beings must submit to general laws ; but it was distinctly not necessary to make them become acquainted with young Frenchmen in a way that would cause these latter to lose the little respect they had for women . An English or American youth sees in a woman a superior creature or a sister or a wife . A young Frenchman sees a woman , and immediately suspects one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not much inclined for marriage , he finds too many female friends always at hand to be attracted by young women who are not bred up to be good mothers and wives , and who would simply be feminine companions , not friends . Without doubt , if marriage could be the association dreamed of by social philanthropists , it would be the state in which woman gave her husband help and advice in his outside work , and in which she was able to interest him in the affairs of the home , in the early education of her children , in the administration of the household . But a Frenchman has little taste for such equality with his wife , who though she has not his qualities has nevertheless their equivalents . He does not object to her using these faculties in society . He either wants a housekeeper who may be a little bib*te , which , he says , " rests him , " or he wants a brilliant woman of the world who amuses him . The new English and American ways will make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of outdoor sports like their husbands , and less praiseworthy housekeepers . They will be drawn away from their true purpose , which they might have attained by a little forethought on the part of their mothers . Had they become good housewives they would have been able to find a sphere for themselves in which they would have , little by little , formed themselves for public // life also , and which would have made them useful to their husbands , just as the latter in carrying out their own affairs well have made themselves to-day capable of carrying on the affairs of their country . The meeting of young French girls with American and English girls , always growing more frequent at winter resorts , baths , watering places , in educational institutions and in daily intercourse , hats little by little melted the ice ; and our girls commenced by envying their sisters , and then gradually came to imitate them . The yoke they had to bear irritated them , and , among themselves , instead of blaming the independence of the foreigners ' manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This came about first at balls , where the imitation commenced in conversation and in a more deliberate carriage ; not as some think in flirtation , which has not been , and never will be , able to force itself into our customs , on account of the danger which this game of love would bring upon our girls  --  a danger which American and English girls do not run ( I trust I can surely believe ) with young Englishmen and Americans . The first young French women who conversed with their partners , who made a tour of the ball room , who rested in the interval between dances at some distance from their mothers , were very severely judged ; but , little by little , contagion affected the most timid , and three or four generations sufficed to bring about a total change . Certain things which appeared natural then , appear ridiculous today ; such as the action of the parents among the tradespeople who did not alLow their daughters to waltz or to appear in d*collet* dress . There was an English game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was croquet . Every mother can recall the first astonishment she felt when she saw her daughter enter into a discussion with a young man who had just been presented to her , or carry a mallet over her shoulders with a little swaggering air as she stretched her figure back or gave jeering answers or laughed aloud . Certainly criticism was not lacking at the start , and when those young girls who astonished even themselves , scarcely recognizing themselves any longer , saw their parents and friends blaming them and some of their companions remaining faithful to the old customs , they began to accuse themselves and promised to be more careful . // The grandmothers lost their heads over the whole affair . They at first called their sons and daughters to task : " How can you tolerate manners like these ? Why , your daughter has the manners of a fishwoman ! In a little while you will only hear her speak when she stands with her hands on her hips ! Young girls with their noses in the air-why , they come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new abomination , these good grandmothers followed the dictates of an egoism that they failed to recognize . But as soon as these liberties had once been taken and the objections conquered their reign was at an end ; and at last all the little children , young girls , and later on young women only had liberty while in their hands , and they were consequently spoiled . They could put on that famous little swaggering air at their grandmother 's . Their education and its seventies devolved upon the mothers , and the grandmother might well say to her daughter , " you bring up your daughter very badly , " but she herself would be indulgent . The lot of the grandmother was certainly the most delightful and enviable in the family . Happiness , influence , confidence , all were lost on account of the grandmother . Peccadillos now could be counted by the hundred , and there was no more running to grandmother to sue for pardon . Youth absolved itself . The young people met their cousins at grandmother 's house ; they became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showed a little of their hearts , of their thoughts and sensibilities , without appearing to parade them before the world or in the house of their parents , which would have been a sign of very bad taste . They played little city and country games at their grandmother 's house . At certain times of the day the old lady had a knowing way of telling them , " Go and amuse yourselves , children ; youth passes quickly enough . " All this took place within the family precincts , with brothers , cousins or friends of one or another-friends of childhood , whose parents had themselves been friends of their parents . But later on , they permitted these things to go on with young men who had been introduced to them within a day or a week , and they occasionally allowed it also with strangers who came from no one knew where , introduced by an introduced friend  --  and you can see the seriousness of the guarantee ! Was there not indeed a reason for the older heads to imagine that the ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that croquet that occupied young girls ' minds in the country , at the seaside or at watering places the whole day , instead of which they used to have moments for reading , music , and embroidery ! And those skirts which were suddenly raised high on the ankle to accomplish a certain stroke in the game , and the next moment carried short to be out of the way ; what immodesty ! what manners ! Great Heavens ! And then came the little boyish cap , the tight fitting jerseys-those flannel betrayers of the form ; - all this followed in the game of court tennis and lawn tennis . To give those heavy blows with a mallet to the balls , or those vigorous strokes with a racquet , interspersed with talk of biceps , of breast , of ankles-what joy , what elegance for the young girls of France ! But how can we help regretting the old graceful movements and games . And the evening ! Ah , the scandal of it ! These young girls playing at roulette or petits chei'aux in the Casinos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or again in the country , as in the drawing room , young women scoffed at the idea of listening to people whom they used to listen to with such pleasure when they were permitted to talk with them ; not to speak of the mixed troops of young boys and girls who play billiards , talk loudly , dispute , and drown the voices of their parents with distance In the city young people go out with a maid or a trotte ? csethat is , with a person who is hired to walk an hour or two with your daughter ; someone whom you do not know any better than a professor of languages ; whom you can neither overhear nor oversee when they are out of doors ; whose moral ideas , whose manners you do not know . And yet to this person you intrust your daughter , thinking of her physical health . Alas , it is a question what becomes of her moral health ! What has become of the good precepts , the long talk with the mother and the grandmother , which formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form traditional in our language ? Where are the hours of reading together when analyses and comments were made as they proceeded ? All that is confided to the professors now , who form the girls ' minds mechanically and enlist them in regiments by the hundreds , to assist in promulgating the mechanical theories that are ordained by custom . After the convent and the pension come lectures ; but , most important of all , // 455 the individual and original education within the family is quite abandoned . What young girl would to-day be willing to take her final lessons in literature and history from her mother and her grandmother ? She would think it unfashionable . A mother who is not rich turns herself into a trotteuse . She runs to the lecture room also There are few individual lessons , for these young girls detest them as they detest solitude and home . They must be out of doors and with their friends . Formerly , the mother directed after a fashion the education of the daughters even in the convent . To-day , she yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mademoiselle wishes now to take everything , to know everything , drawing , music . languages , algebra , dancing ,  --  and it is ruinous . Still , if the custom of the dowry had disappeared with these manners of the past , it might have been better ; but that has remained* adding to the expenses of education , expenses that increase as boys and girls demand more and more and give less and less in return . English and Americans , when they gave these manners and customs , would have done well to help the girls find husbands for themselves and to teach them to go into marriage without new responsibilities and without drawing on the fortune or the comfort of their parents , acquired with such difficulty and sacrifice . All these new fashions would have been , and should be , accepted with resignation by the parents , if the rupture in the question of family property , involving rights therein that are dear to the French , did not threaten to make the opposition still stronger before long . How often one sees parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have no children . My daughters take no more interest in their mother 's life . My sons do not trouble themselves about any of my affairs . " And what a void , what bitterness all this makes for the older members of the family These poor old people can not live up to the standards of their daughters , who only a few years ago talked with them as comrades , and who treat them to-day as inferiors . These young people discuss and judge after their own manner , they form their minds more and more personally and independently , opposing the ideas of the family with an avidity that corresponds with their youthful activity . And taking their dreams for intellectual power , they become infatuated and look upon their parents as old and superannuated . They still go occasionally to their brothers and fathers for RJ ' // counsel , for they are bureaus of news from the dear outside world . But they desert their mothers when it is not necessary for the latter to accompany them to lectnres . They abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are no longer even amusing . Amusing ! To be amnsing-that is the touchstone of the generation which is succeeding the pessimists The family has already split in two , one part being the younger members , who simply amuse themselves ; the other , the mature and the aged  --  the mature fretting over these changes and digging deeper the abyss of separation , the aged trying to make themselves young again by any and all means , so as not to be thrown aside ; and they succeed in giving themselves at least the appearance of youth . The sight of the first is heartrending , that of the second lamentable-painted men and women with red and blonde hair , trying to retain complexion or ward off white hairs , who , seeing that they are being finally abandoned , wish to be young again and to amuse and be amused . The vacation , which formerly united the most divided families , now sees them scattered . Those who make a supreme effort to gather together see at such time that the estrangement of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their independence they wish to make their own lives and to lead them by themselves . The error is growing more and more serious , caused by the impatience felt at any restraint . A young girl once married , fin de si*cle , as they say in Paris , that is , having to a greater or less degree these faults or good qualities ,  --  it is immaterial which ,  --  will not allow her mother to give her advice in regard to the management of her household and in bringing up her children . It is quite true that by this she rids her household of the meddling interference of a typical mother-in-law . At any rate she prefers to the experience of her family , her own inexperience and the advice of a hired nurse or cook , which she is always free to follow or not as she wishes . The children who remain at home do not interest the father now when he returns at night , except with the little accounts of their own plans and amusements for the day , if these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attraction for him ; it is no longer a place of high interests , the means for the exchange of the highest ideas and of the best sentiments ; it is the place where he is free to don his dressing gown and to put on his // 457 slippers , and he can not now teach good lessons by his example or his personal authority . It is useless for him to study his children , or to try to bring them np well , to watch them and retain their respect . It is the place for rest , and he gives himself up to that . There is no more advice , for it is seldom followed ; ne more principles by which the minds of the children were formerly moulded according to the judgment of the entire family ; no more of the spirit which was always ready for the greatest sacrifices where one of the members needed the devotion of the rest and appealed to it . To-day each one is for himself . If the dowry did not exist in France , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families , they would be free like American girls before they were ten years old , and would later choose husbands for themselves . They must be interested in the fortunes of their parents , even though this is only for the sake of knowing who they can aspire to marry and who can pretend to marry them . In Paris young girls are constantly thrown together , and they escape from their families in this way . In the provinces and the country , being much more isolated and thoughtful , they are at times more or less open to some paternal restraint , but submission is with them only an exception ; they only think of marriage , which will set them free and give them the right to go out into the world alone at the age of twenty-five . One can hear and see the changes which have taken place in twenty-five years when one hears them talking together . For the grandmothers and the mothers of the old school it is paralyzing . The questions , the confidences , exchange of ideas , projects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , criticism on young men whom they appreciate to a surprising degree-all this was formerly reserved for the family 's ears alone , for the mother and the grandmother ; and now it has become the privilege of the friend , or of several friends , and more 's the pity As we would weep over a world which is disintegrating and dying , so in France one has to weep over the family . But all that is torn from its bleeding heart is added to the individual . The young woman is making herself ; now she is only at the entrance of the new life which young men are leaving behind them . She will become , from day to day , in every sense more of a companion in marriage . At present she only sees before her the pleasure of escaping from a cage . She will understand // in a little while the responsibilities of liberty . Better armed agaiust social dangers , she will choose more intelligently those by whose side she will strive for the comforts of life . Already , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broken from a world too narrow for them , we can see rising a superior womanhood , and we must acknowledge it a strong one . They have lost , it is true , the poetry concealed under the old veiled existence , the emotions of their devout and silent sentiments-delicate and sweet as they were  --  but they have conquered much in exchange . They are loyal and just , and being after all of one blood , they have the worship of the larger family , that of the French nation . Our grandmothers and mothers can think of one fact that will always be a great consolation for them-that is , that if our daughters belong less to us , they belong more to themselves , and if we have much more unhappy lives , perhaps they are becoming far happier.
