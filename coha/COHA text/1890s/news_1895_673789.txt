txt The meeting at the Cooper Union on Monday evening should be made an emphatic demonstration of public opinion in this city on the subject of municipal reform . There is plenty of evidence that the people can not safely rely upon their " verdict " at the polls last November as a " mandate " that will be heeded by the Legislature . There is no doubt as to what it meant . The people elected Mr. Strong as their Mayor in order that he might exercise all the power and bear all the responsibility rightfully belonging to the office , and in the distinct expectation that the legislation necessary to enable him to do SQ would be granted . But there are designs of politicians that are in conflict with their demand , and it is necessary that the pressure of the demand should be strong and continuous . The Legislature will heed public opinion only when convinced that it is real and uncompromising by a direct expression from the people themselves . The only way the people can give expression to their opinion when no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making declaration of it . For this reason the proposed meeting should be overwhelming in attendance and unanimous in sentiment . That it may be unanimous , those who are to direct ' its proceedings should avoid matters of detail upon which there are differences of opinion . Upon the principles ' involved there are no differences of opinion among those who have municipal reform and good government of flip city at heart . They are agreed upon the great fundamental principle of home rule for the city , which means that the powers to be exercised in the administration of its local affairs shall be exercised by authorities of its own choosing . ' Whether the reorganization of the police force , which is unquestionably needed , shall be effected through a commission of three citizens or by some other means may be a matter for difference of opinion , but that the Commissioners , if appointed , should be named by the Mayor of New York and not by the Governor of the State does not admit of question under the principle of . " home rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concedes this appointment to the Mayor , as it doubtless will , and if the Legislature agrees to the change , it must not be taken as any ground for compromise . There are other applications of the same principle , and it should be insisted upon in all cases . Yielding of opposition upon one . point should not relax the tension of the public demand for thoroughgoing reform . Another fundamental principle is that the government of the city  --  that is to say , the management of the public business of the city , in which all its citizens have a common concern  --  shall be nonpartisan . It must be for the benefit of the people of the city and the advancement of their interests , and not for the advantage of any party or a division of profits between any political organizations . We have elected a Mayor on a non-partisan platform , and he has given pledges to conform to its requirements . The power therefore must be given him to do so . Whether the head of this or that department should be single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent and honest citizens differ . But that the Mayor should have the power to appoint the heads of departments all are agreed . To exercise that power he must be able to remove the heads which he found in office when the people commissioned him for that task , without any bargains as to how the vacancies shall be filled . The mass meeting is necessary to strengthen and support Mayor Strong . It is necessary to impress forcibly upon the Legislature what it is that the people of New-York City demand and , , to show an unwavering determination io have the substance and not the shadow of what thertztsk for . It is necessary to prevent anytigehing of the fruits of popular victory for municipal reform by fioliticians for party use . A mass , meeting is not the place for framing or " indorsing " specific acts of legislation , but it is the place for declaring and insisting upon fundamental principles and protesting against any legislation that violates those principles . There is ' occasion ' for a great meeting on Monday night and one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
