txt A S T evening we found our box of bananas had been stolen , and turning over our things , we found that most of our few European provisions were gone also . What we shall do now for food I 've no idea , for we are almost destitute in the middle of this wilderness , and do n't even know how far ahead the Arabs may be . We all sat round the fire till late last night , and talked over the grim outlook . We allowed ourselves a small sip of brandy all round ; we have still four of the six bottles of brandy left , which we brought with us from Yambnya . " These are the words I read in my journal under the date October 5 , 1887 . For fourteen weeks we had been toiling on in the dim twilight of the forest , and for two months had scarcely known what it was to have a full meal . Two and a half months before we had started off from Yambuya , a compact and cheery body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were all in good spirits and in good condition , and had thought that by this time we should have reached Emin Pasha . Yet here we were , with sadly diminished numbers , still in the ghostly shades of the forest , hundreds of miles from the Nyanza , without strength , without food , and almost without hope . Picture to yourselves a small , tattered band of men , camped on a sandy spit of land in the heart of Africa . On this small cleared space are the three tents of the Europeans , round which , in a semi-circle , the Zanzibari porters have raised little temporary shelters of broken boughs and green leaves . It is evening , the camp-fires are lighted , and round them may be seen the half-starved forms of our men , gathered together in small groups , talking dejectedly of our miserable position . Here and there is a man by the fires stirring a pot , in which are simmering a few toadstools , or such poor roots as he has been able to collect on the march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking and singing ; the busy forms of our men might be seen flitting about by the light of the fires , some building huts , some preparing large pots of bananas or manioc for the evening meal ; others passing some rough jest to their fellows , and all laughing and talking in the boisterous way which characterizes the good-natured , happygo-lucky Zanzibari under favorable circumstances . But to-night Europeans and Zauzibaris are alike dejected and cast down , for starvation and sickness have sapped our strength , and we all know that unless food can soon be obtained we have nothing but death before us . Behind the camp is the black , lonely forest , its giant trees rising above and closing over us , as if we were in some dark , haunted cavern , the gloom of which seems to shut out all hope . In front is the now darkening river , hurling itself madly over rocks and bowlders . Above we can hear the thunder copyright , 1S9* , by charles Scribners Sons . All rights reserved . // of the cataracts , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite side of the river , the bank , densely sick men , unable to march , and almost unable from weakness to use the paddles . Scarcely a man in the expedition but had K clothed with huge trees and tangled underwood , rises abruptly from the stream to a height of five hundred feet . We feel so small and helpless , as if we were closed in in a huge pit , with nothing but the desolation of the forest and the thunder of the cataracts around us . If we failed now , who would ever know how we fell , and how we had tried manfully to do our duty ? This , briefly , was our position on that memorable evening of October 5 , 1887 . The expedition was in the utmost state of weakness . The condition of our men , owing to the privations they had undergone , and the want of meat or even nourishing food , was such , that the slightest scratch of a thorn or bush quickly developed into large gangrenous sores , and these ulcers raged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canoes had been full of some sore on his feet or ankles ; in some cases these sores were so virulent that the whole side of the leg was eaten away , leaving the bone bare and exposed . When the bandages from these ulcers were taken off , large pieces of flesh would sometimes fall away , and the agony thc men suffered was intense . The river seemed now to have become nothing but a gigantic mountain torrent , and our boat and fleet of canoes were useless . Here we were , then , a small band of men , with many sick and dying , and with more loads than we could possibly carry , at the foot of a series of cataracts whose size and number we had no means of ascertaining . Mr. Stanley called a " Shauri ' ( council ) , in which the position was clearly explained to Europeans and Zanzibaris alike . Some days before we had met a small Fire , Master of the Cannon , fire eagerly whispered the Zanzibaris. - Page 273. // party of Manyema slave raiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told us that their settlement was some days ahead . Captain Nelson had for weeks been ailing , and for many days , owing to the ulcers on his feet , had been obliged to be carried in one of the canoes . It was therefore decided at the council that he should be left behind at the camp , together with the sick men and such loads as we were unable to carry . The rest of the expedition was to hurry on as fast as we could toward the Arab camp , and send back relief with as little delay as possible to Nelson and the starving men . We all agreed that it would be impossible to leave the boat behind ; she had been of inestimable value to us , and we did not know what was ahead , and how soon we might have to cross unfordable rivers or creeks . The boat , therefore , was to be taken to pieces and carried by my men . Our Zanzibari chiefs made a proposal ful division . We had a pot of Liebig 's beef-tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrowroot , one small tin of tapioca , some tea and coffee , and four bottles of brandy . These we had been carefully saving in case of sickness , and they were all that were left unstolen of our little store of European provisions ; our native provisions were all finished . We handed over to Nelson his share of tea and coffee , a bottle of brandy , a pot of beef-tea , a tin of butter , and a small portion of arrowroot and tapioca . The rest Stairs , Parke , and myself took as our share , and we treated ourselves all round to a sip of brandy to keep up our spirits and soothe our hungry stomachs . Early next morning the entire expedition was mustered , and the men and loads were carefully counted over . I got the boat taken to pieces and all my loads ready . I found that , out of the eighty-eight men who had formed my company when I left Yambuya , I could that five of their number should start emptyhanded ahead and try to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and return with it to help the loaded caravan which would be following in their track . Stanley agreed to this , and told IRaschid , our head - chief , to choose his men . He chose Khamis Parry , one of Stairs ' chiefs , M un i a Pembe , a staid old chief of Nelson 's company , and Khamis Kurum and Alsasi wadi Simba ( Alsasi , the Lion 's son ) , who were two of the chiefs of my company . We shook hands with them and wished them good luck , and they started off amid the cry of " Bismallah " ( In the name of God ) from the only muster forty-two who were fit to Zanzibaris. carry loads , and many of these were so qwq and Nelson 's companies were in much the same condition , and Stanley 's company , though composed of the picked men of the expedition , was almost as bad . Early next morning Stanley started off with his company , promising to clear a path , as well as he could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the thick undergrowth . Stairs , Parke , and I then made a careful examination of the men and loads , and found that we should be obliged to leave fiftysix men and eighty-one loads behind . Many of the men were so cowed and hopeless that they wished only to be left to die peacefully where they were . But any man who was at all able to crawl along we passed as fit to travel , and those fifty-six men we left were nearly all in the last stage of starvation and sickness . At any rate , we thought that their chances of getting food would be better if they came with us , and nothing could be gained by remaining where they were . We had great difficulty in getting the men off with the loads , and it was past midday before the last of the caravan filed out of what is now known as Nelson 's starvation camp . I find the following words in my journal that morning : " It is a truly terrible position for Nelson to be left in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to exist on what he can pick up in the shape of fungi or roots . Stairs has left him a fish-hook and line , and it is possible he may get a few small fish , but the river is so rapid and full of bowlders that he has but a slight chance of catching anything . Meantime we are going on with an exhausted and starving column to try and find food in a trackless wilderness . Nelson is now so crippled from ulcers that he can not creep far from camp , and will have to depend entirely upon what his two boys can manage to bring him . " We got off about two o'clock and sadly said good-by to poor old Nelson , for his position is very precarious and our chances of relieving him small ; he has worked with us in good fellowship all these months , and now we are practically abandoning him . " Stairs , Parke , and I marched along slowly and silently at the rear of the struggling column , trying to cheer up and urge forward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad , all up and down , through ravines and creeks , and the men ahead with Stanley were so exhausted that scarcely any path had been cut . We had fearful difficulty in getting the boat along , and could hear the sections ahead bumping against rocks or trees . The men were so weak that the slightest knock against a tree or bush caused them to lose their balance and fall heavily to the ground . Owing to the hopeless brooding state into which they had fallen , it was often difficult to make them get up and resume their burdens . Some , in answer to our appeals to them not to give up , would answer , " Master , how long is this to last ? What is the good of struggling on any longer ? Let us lie down quietly and die . " Stanley , who had started early in the morning , had got some distance ahead , and at dark we were obliged to camp by ourselves , having only managed to march three miles . We had with us merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; our boxes and blankets were on ahead with the main column . We lit fires and had half a cup of tapioca made into a sort of thin gruel ; into this we put a tablespoonful each of brandy , and we also made some coffee It was not much of a meal for three men who had been in a hungry state for weeks , but we lay down that night on the bare ground , thankful that we had got to the end of another day and had moved a few more miles on our way toward relief . Our men , poor fellows , had little besides a few toadstools they had picked up here and there on the way . Fortunately , starvation had the effect of making the men somewhat torpid and sleepy , and for a brief space they were able to get a respite from the pangs of hunger , and for a few hours forgot their troubles in a heavy sleep . The next morning we were up early , and before starting had a cup of coffee each ; the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had a very hard day , urging the men forward with the boat , and were able to get along but slowly , for the men were only able to go a short distance , and then sit // qwq narily called " grains of Paradise , " and are used , I am told , by publicans for putting in their beer , in order to cause their customers a consuming and remunerative thirst . There were several other kinds of fruits , but they could not be considered as food , for they were chiefly of a sickly description which caused the person who had eaten them violent sickness . Immediately on leaving Nelson 's camp the land rose abruptly from the river , and we had to march inland to avoid the rocky precipices which formed the banks of the stream . For the first day we had been slowly rising higher and higher , but on the second day the land sloped gradually down , and at mid-day we again found ourselves on the river-bank . We could hear the thunder of a huge fall below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place was somewhat more than a hundred and twenty feet higher than the level of the river at Nelson 's Camp , which was only a few miles distant . We eventually discovered that the river , after forming into a series of rapids , hurled itself madly into a chasm of some eighty feet deep , and rushed like a mountain torrent down to Nelson 's Camp . The river , where we now struck it , was about five hundred yards broad , full of rapids among which were dotted small grassy islands . As we were marching along , Kheri , one of the chiefs who was with us , came running back , whispering breathlessly , " Tembo , B'wana , Tembo ! " ( An elephant , master , an elephant . ) We crept anxiously along the path , holding our breath with excitement . The men all silently put down their loads and followed us , stroking their poor empty stomachs in expectancy of a meal at last . Following Kheri 's lead , we soon reached a wooded promontory , and cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards distant , on a little grassy island in the middle of the rapids , a huge black elephant with gleaming white tusks , slowly flapping his great ears and feeding leisurely on the tall grass which covered the island . " Piga , B'wana Mazinga , piga ! " ( Fire , Master of the Cannon , fire ! ) eagerly whispered the Zanzibaris . Stairs , who was always coolness itself , cocked his rifle , slowly VOL . IX. - 30 rose , and resting the barrel against a tree , took a long and steady aim , while we held our breath and clasped our empty stomachs , anxiously awaiting the result . Bang ! went the rifle , we saw a puff of dust rise where the bullet struck just at the back of the ear , and the elephant dropped on his knees . " Ressassi M'gini , Kheri " ( Another cartridge , Kheri ) , whispered Stairs , excitedly , for the elephant had risen and was slowly rocking himself to and fro , as if dazed and confused . The crack of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapids , and the elephant seemed unconscious from whence had come this sudden shock . As he swayed backward and forward , and slowly turned himself round , Stairs put two more bullets into his head . But alas I we discovered that a Remington rifle bullet is not much more efficacious against an elephant than a pea-shooter is against a man ; for the elephant , still swaying about uneasily , deliberately waded off across the rapids to a large wooded island in the middle of the river , where it was impossible to reach him . We recovered ourselves with a long-drawn sigh of disappointment , we blankly looked in each other 's faces , and the Zanzibaris murmured , " Master , it is fate , let us be going . " After this little excitement , our dejection was more intensified ; the men doggedly resumed their burdens , and we toiled slowly and silently on . At about two o'clock in the afternoon , we had reached a place where the banks were almost level with the river , which had become very broad and tolerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent the greater part of the men to search for fruit or fungus , a messenger came back from Stanley with a note for me , telling , me that the river , with the exception of a few rapids , was tolerably clear ahead . He said he was encamped some miles ahead , on a spot opposite an island , on which they had found a few natives ; that he had followed an elephant the day before , which he had wounded severely ; and that it had waded off to an island , where it was probably dying . He ordered me , therefore , to put the boat together and search for the elephant ; the Zanzibari who brought // the message knew where it was , and would be able to show me the place . The messenger carried some knives and bill-hooks to cut up the elephant when we found it . Stairs at once blew the horn and called in the men . I put the boat together , took my trusty coxswain , the faithful Uledi , my crew of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , and started off down river to search for the elephant . Meanwhile Stairs and Parke marched on with the rest of the men to join Stanley . I searched up and down the river , every island and creek where it was possible for the elephant to hide . However , darkness closed over us without our finding a trace of him , and we were obliged to turn back and make our way up the river in the dark . There were so many small rapids in the way that it was halfpast eight before , disappointed and disheartened , we saw the lights of Stanley 's camp-fires ahead . They had heard our shouts across the river , and we saw torches flashing in the darkness as they hurried down to the river-bank . In half an hour more we had reached the landing . Here we found Stanley , the officers , and the men , crowding down to the water 's edge with baskets and knives , eager to get their share of the meat . A few words dispelled their hopes , and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men turned away to crouch and brood over the camp-fires . There seemed to be nothing but disappointment in those days . Stairs had saved my supper for me : three-quarters of a cup of cold porridge , which was my share of the handful of Indian corn which our men had found on the island . Stairs , Parke , and I sat long over the fire that night talking ; it was my birthday , and we treated ourselves all round to a few sips of brandy . Stanley and his men , it appeared , on reaching this camp had found a couple of small canoes tied to the bank ; in these some of the men had crossed over to the island , where there was a small temporary encampment of natives , and among them a large number of dwarf women and children . They had hidden themselves up to their necks in the mud on the side of the island , where they were found in threes and fours by our men ; thirteen in all , varying from three feet ten to four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were perfectly nude , with the exception of a number of necklaces and girdles made of a kind of river shells , like mussel shells , cut into little round disks and strung closely together . All of them had five or more holes pierced in their upper lips , and in these were stuck stiff elephant hairs in lengths of about four inches . They stood out round the mouth like a cat 's whiskers , and wagged in the most ludicrous way when the women spoke . When brought into our camp they apparently , after the first few minutes , had no fear . They were full of information and talked most volubly , but we were unable to understand the greater part of what they said . They evidently were in great fear of the Arabs , and had retired to the island to escape from them . They pointed in the direction from which the Arabs came , and called them Wa-tomba-tomba , which name they pronounced and accentuated to imitate the sound of guns ; they also went through the pantomime of firing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that we felt certain the Arabs could not be far distant . One thing we learned from the women which proved most useful . For some days we had found large flat brown beans , which grew upon very high trees in certain parts of the forest ; under these trees the ground was thickly strewn with beans . The men , who called them Quemma , roasted them and tried to eat them , but they had a bitter , nauseous taste like a horse-chestnut , and they soon gave up attempting to eat them . The dwarf women , however , now showed us a method of preparing these beans which made them slightly less unpalatable . They peeled all the outside off the beans , and scraping them into thin shavings , pounded them into a sort of rough flour . This they mixed with water and made into a kind of paste , which they rolled in green leaves and baked upon the embers . These cakes , which were much like cakes made of sawdust , were neither palatable // nor nourishing , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped somewhat to stop the cravings of hunger . The dwarf women also boiled this flour and made it into a kind of mucilaginous gruel . It was decided to stop a day in this camp and send out men on both sides of the river to look for food or signs of the Arabs . The men , however , returned in the evening without having seen any traces of them ; they brought back , however , a small store of fungus and a little fruit looking like a mango . It had a good smell and we tried to eat some of it , but it was most sickly , and after a few mouthfuls it caused violent sickness and made the head dizzy . Stanley , who had eaten it , was ill for some hours ; he said it seemed as if an iron band had been tied round his temples . Stairs and Parke went out to try and get a shot at something , but they returned having seen absolutely nothing in the way of birds or game . We had with us two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined not to kill until we were absolutely at our last gasp . The donkeys had become very thin and diseased , as there was scarcely any grass to be found in the forest . Near the camp was a large grassy island in the middle of the river , and three men were sent over to it in a canoe to cut grass for the donkeys . The Zanzibaris were as thoughtless as children , and these men actually did not take their guns ; they had nothing but one small knife with them . While one of the men was cutting forage , a native who was lying concealed close by , seeing that none of the men were armed , sprang upon Feruzi Ali , and began hacking at his head with a long , glittering knife . The two other men in the canoe , seeing the native struggling with their comrade , instead of going to his aid , merely shouted for help . We could see the struggle going on , and though they were within easy range of our rifles , we dared not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali struggled manfully , but the blows were raining down mercilessly on his bare head , and the streams of blood were blinding him . He was a strong man , but he had been taken unawares and was wounded before he had any chance of defending himself . The boat was hastily pushed off , and we shouted to the men to hurry , for it was terrible to see the struggle for life and death going on before our very eyes , and be powerless to help Feruzi . Before the boat reached the island , by a desperate effort he shook himself clear of the native and threw himself into the river ; while the savage , seeing the boat so near , plunged into the rapids on the other side of the island , and , reaching the opposite bank , managed to escape . Feruzi Mi was frightfully cut about ; there were several deep cuts on his head , and his shoulders , arms , and hands were gashed in the most dreadful manner . Parke , who examined the wounds , said that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Most of the men who went over to the opposite side of the river in search of food , did not return that evening ; they had gone too far and were benighted . It remained for us , therefore , to stay another day in this melancholy camp . We again went out in search of game , but again returned without having fired a shot . In the afternoon Stairs and I fished with the only fish-hook We possessed . After fishing for a couple of hours Stairs caught three , each about five inches long . We gave one to Stanley , and had the other two for our dinner . How we wished now for a miracle which would feed the starving multitude with the three small fishes ! As we were sitting round the fire after eating them , the boat was hailed from the other side of the river , and it at once pushed off to bring back our foraging party . They had managed to get a few small bananas , some native tobacco , and a fair amount of fungus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but it was only a handful apiece . The foragers said they had come across signs of the Arabs , in the shape of blazed trees at the side of the native paths . Stanley decided next morning to start on and send the boat up the river in charge of IJledi . We were all now so weak that the slightest exertion we made to climb over rocks or fallen trees caused a strange giddiness , and at every fresh // effort we broke out into a cold perspiration . The month of October was , as Stanley said , an awful month , and no member of the expedition , black or white , will ever forget it . I see in my journal , under the date October 11th , the following words : " The state of the people is frightful ; it was most distressing last evening to see the men lying about the camp , and to hear their groans throughout the night . They are dropping their loads right and left , and many will be lost today , I fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way through the dense undergrowth , wading through mud and streams , wet through from morning till night , and with hardly anything to still the cravings of hunger . Several of our men fell that day and never reached camp . They would creep away from the path and hide in the bushes , and after the caravan had gone by , would crawl out to the path and try to follow us ; some of them got into camp late at night , but others we never saw again . One of my chiefs , Muftah bin Machicha , who had long been getting weaker and weaker , stayed behind in this way , and never reached camp . Three men , Soudi , Behani , and another , who were in Stanley 's company , deserted with their loads . One of them was carrying most of Parke 's clothes , another , a bale of boots and clothes we were bringing to Emin Pasha , and a third , something else equally valuable . These loads we nev*r found , for the men threw them away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Ugarrowa 's Station , where we found them many months afterward on our return through the forest . We marched about seven miles that day , but in that march we lost twelve men , four from desertion , and the rest from exhaustion and starvation . Late in the evening one of the men who had been sent in the boat to bring her up the river , came into camp ; he said that in getting the boat over the rapids she had struck upon a rock , and the force of the blow had broken the bolts of one of the sections , and she was now at the foot of a large rapid in a very bad state and leaking fast . As I was in charge of the boat , Stanley ordered me to return to the boat next morning and mend her up . Accordingly , next morning I started off , taking with me my favorite chief , Ra .. jab bin Jumah and five men , who carried some iron bolts and india-rubber pack-. ing for the boat section . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground I had toiled along so painfully before . Finding no traces of the Arabs on this side of the river , Stanley wished to send men across the stream to search the opposite bank . We could see a small canoe tied to a tree on a little island in the middle of the river , and Stanley asked who would swim across and fetch it . One of our best men volunteered , and was promised ten dollars if he was successful . Owing however to his weakened state , he was caught in the rapids , and drowned almost before our eyes . The attempt was therefore abandoned , and Stanley decided to go on and wait for the boat to catch him up . On my way back we passed the dead body of Muftah ben Machicha and two others near him , who were just breathing their last . They had all probably hidden in the brushwood until the straggling caravan had passed , and had been unable to reach camp . At about two o'clock in the afternoon I reached the boat at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous position ; six of the top bolts had given way in one of the sections , and it was a wonder she had not foundered . Uledi , however , who was ever ready in any emergency , had cleverly fastened her up with one of the boat ropes , and had packed some native cloth into the seams . This had considerably stopped the leak , but three men were continually kept baling and just managed to keep her afloat . In an hour I got the boat mended , and we then began to get her over the rapid . It was fearfully hard work hauling her round rocks and up small cataracts , and it was almost dark before we got to the head of the rapids . I managed to urge the men to row up stream a bit further , and told them to sing one of their boat songs ; they tried , but it was a failure , and after singing a bar or two they stopped , // saying , " We can not sing , for our hearts are dead within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the boat up the rapid at all , for the rowers were utterly worn out , and had it not been for the unflagging energy of Uledi , whom nothing could daunt , I do not think we should have accomplished much ; for he always helped in all my endeavors to hearten the men up . Now and then he would make a caustic remark if he saw one of the boatmen giving in , and even in those , our worst days , our men were never indifferent to some rough jest which would always be answered by a wan smile . An hour before dark we tied up against the bank , and the men went out in search of fungus or tree-beans . Bajab bin Jumah lighted a big fire and cut some green boughs for my bed , for I had no tent or blankets with me . Shortly after dark the men returned , bringing in a number of tree-beans and a small supply of fungus . They gave me a share of what they had found , for I had absolutely nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans and boiled them into a thick gruel , putting a few toadstools in to give it a taste . It was a most unpalatable , sickening mess , but I drank and was thankful for it . We were all too hungry and tired to sleep much , and I sat up half the night reading my little pocket Shakespeare by the light of the camp-fire . I always carried it in my pocket . It contained only two plays , " Antony and Cleopatra , " and " The Merchant of Venice , " and these will I think always be my favorites , having read them over so many times in the forest . I cannot speak gratefully enough of the conduct of our faithful Zanzibaris at this period . On them we were entirely dependent for such food as we were able to scrape together . The Zanzibari , it is true , will lie and thieve-most untaught negroes will  --  but with the white man with whom he has worked , whom he respects and has confidence in , though starving himself , he will share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who was scarcely more than skin and bone , and who was half mad with hunger himself , bringing us a little store of toadstools and laying it before us , say , " Master , take your share , God is good . " There was something childlike and simple about these Zanzibaris which always appealed strongly to our sympathy . At work you may be as severe as you please ; you may flog him when he does wrong , so long as when work is done you relax , and gossip and talk with him . His quaint remarks upon people and things are always entertaining , and oftefi instructive . You listen to his stories about his wife or mother , his sister or friend , about his home in Zanzibar , and his little plot of land ; in fact you make him feel , that though you will force him to do his full share of work , at the same time you sympathize with him in his troubles and are really his friend . If you do this he will work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often seen aZanzibari who had laid himself open to punishment , lie down and take his fifteen or twenty strokes of the cane , and after he has received them get up , and , raising his hands above his head , say " Hamd el Allah " ( Thank God ) , by which he means he has done wrong , he has received his punishment , and now he and the world are even . If punished justly , this child of nature never bears malice ; but injustice , want of sympathy , or cruelty will transform him into a sullen , mutinous devil , with whom nothing can be done . Of course there are times when the Zanzibari is most troublesome and has to be treated with great severity , but when once he understands that a man is his friend and master , these ebullitions are not of frequent occurrence . People , when they first go to Africa , naturally look at things from a civilized point of view , and are not able to understand the strange working of an African 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . But if they endeavor , ever so little , to put themselves in his place , they will soon understand how to deal with the Africans , how to gain their respect and affection , and how to make them work with them , with a fidelity almost unknown among civilized people . Our leader possessed this faculty in a very large degree , and partly through his teaching and partly from our own feeling of sympathy and liking for our // men , we of the " Advance Column " worked with our men in perfect accord ; and had we not learned this way of dealing with them , we could never have held together during those fearful days of our march through the dark forest . We were up early next morning , and I gave the men a little tea all round and told them we must work hard that day , or we should not catch Stanley . After pulling for an hour the river became again broken up into rapids and was studded with a network of islands , so that we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass which fringed the islands ; they looked huge , wading slowly about in the rapids . Of course we were not able to approach them near enough for a shot , and with our Remington rifles only it would have been useless to attempt it . After pulling some time we saw a canoe tied against the bank of an island , and as we approached some arrows fell close to the boat ; but the men sprang ashore and the natives retired without our firing a shot . On the bank we found a small basket of beans , two large baskets , each containing about a peck and a half of beautiful Indian corn , several finely cured gazelle skins , and fifteen or twenty large packages of native tobacco , well prepared and beautifully packed in parcels shaped like huge dumb-bells . The men 's joy at the sight of the corn was delightful to witness after the dejection under which they had suffered for so many days . They smiled , and raising their faces and hands to heaven , cried : " Allah be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the shore to ma3*e a division of the food and allow the men to have a good feed then and there . I reserved a basket of Indian corn and five packets of tobacco for Stanley and ourselves , but all the rest I divided equally among the boat 's crew . We saw two of our men lying dead by the side of the track near where we stopped ; they were scarcely cold , and must have died that morning while trying to follow the caravan . As we were cooking our corn , another of our men crawled out of the bushes on his hands and feet ; he was a living skeleton , and could only mumble a few words in a voice which was scarcely human . I made lIJledi boil some corn until it was very soft , and then mashed it up and gave it to him with a little tea . He snatched at it almost like an animal . We took him on board the boat , but in half an hour he died , and we had to pitch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up over the cataracts , and in the afternoon got among a network of islands with rapid channels rushing between them . On rounding the end of a large wooded island we came upon a most extraordinary sight . Some sixty or seventy natives , men , women , and children , were in the rapid clinging to rocks or boughs of trees . They evidently took us for the Arabs , and imagined the boat would come up on the side of the island next to the main land . They probably thought that in case we landed on the island , they would elude our observation by hiding themselves in the water . Their astonishment and terror , therefore , knew no bounds when the boat shot round on the inner side of the island and approached them . Those men who could swim dived or ducked behind the rocks , but the women in. their terror abandoned their children and made for the shore . It was piteous to see women , small children , and babies swept past us in the yellow flood ; we saw tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , and then disappearing forever over the cataracts below . I shouted to the men to help them , and we seized a woman by the hand as she was being swept past us and hauled her on board ; but while we were trying to save some others , she , thinking we intended to harm her , flung herself again into the water , and she , too , was overwhelmed in the cataract . We passed on and worked up stream till nearly dark , when a violent thunderstorm came on , and soon drenched us to the skin . At the foot of a large rapid I ordered the men to tie up for the night and camp , which , poor fellows , they were ready enough to do . About half a mile ahead I could see the light of Stanley 's camp-fires , and decided to go on myself by land to him , taking with me the basket of Indian corn I had got in the morning ; for I kiaew that he and Stairs and Parke must be in des* // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . In half an hour I had reached the camp . Stanley and the rest were astonished and delighted when they saw the corn . I see in his book , " Darkest Africa , " he calls it " a reprieve from death . " On my bringing the corn into his tent , Stanley said to me : " This , Jephson , is the second time you have done us a good turn ; you have brought us food now when we are starving , and you captured that large canoe down river , which has been of such value to us for carrying our sick so many weeks . " I record this , for it was absolutely the first word of commendation or encouragement we had any of us heard from our leader , and it greatly surprised us . It was not till some months afterward that we began to understand that , under the seeming indifference our leader had for his officers , there lay a strong sympathy and interest for all that we did , though he seldom allowed it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Rear Column " only been long enough with him , they too would have understood their leader , as we of the " Advance Column " eventually learned to do . The corn was at once divided between Stanley , Stairs , Parke , myself , and Stanley 's German servant . What joy to find , on measuring it out , there were thirty-six cups of corn ! I learnt that during the two days I had been away , the dejected , hopeless state of the men had increased to a fearful extent , and the people were rabid with hunger . We had been looking for the return of the five chiefs whom we had sent ahead to find the Arabs ; yet already ten days had elapsed and we had heard nothing of them . Stanley decided to remain for a day where we were and send out the strongest men to try and find food , but they were so dejected that we had almost to drive them out of the camp . As usual , they came in with nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not some of us poisoned in those days , for the toadstools we ate were all colors , purple , orange , green , or red , and we knew nothing about their being edible ; the men only knew they were hungry and must eat something . The next day Stanley crossed the entire expedition over to the other side of the river , and a few chosen scouts were sent out to search for the Arab path , which Stanley felt certain lay inland from the river . Before crossing the river we blazed the trees all round , and cut arrows pointing across the stream , in order to show our lost chiefs that we had crossed , in case they returned on their track . We also wrote a few lines on a blazed tree to tell them to cross and follow us ; Khamis Parry could read English and would understand it . On the opposite bank we once more sent out men to find food , but they were as unsuccessful on this as on the other side . In this camp poor Ferazi Mi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savage , died from compression of the brain . He had day by day been getting worse , and at last became idiotic , and at night fell into one of the campfires and was burned . The next morning Stanley called another council , in which various suggestions were made . Our state was so distressing that there was a question of abandoning the boat and marching inland ; but Uedi , ever ready , volunteered to take her up the river over the rapids with a picked crew , and promised to cut across and join us if he found it was impossible to get on . There was no path , not even an elephant track , and we had to cut our way due north through one of the densest districts of the forest we had yet seen . It was a most distressing march , and many of our men dropped by the way , and we lost some of the loads . Fortunately , we got a small store of wild cardamom fruit which somewhat refreshed us . I was burning with fever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-day halt and were roasting some fungi on the embers of the fire , some of the men discovered a few " M'bungu " fruit on a high tree . They at once climbed up after it , and one of them , over-venturesome , crept out on to a rotten branch , which immediately gave way with a crash . The man fell from a height of sixty feet on two men who were standing below , and all three were knocked senseless . The man who fell got a slight concussion of the brain , but after lying // senseless for half an hour he was able to stand up and talk , and eventually all three men walked into camp . The man was in a very poor and atarved condition , so that his recovery was marvellous , and will give some idea of the wonderful tenacity of life which our Zanzibaris possessed . At about 4.30 we reached Stanley , who had struck upon a little cleared native camp and had pitched his tent there ; it was like a round dark cave in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people was desperate , he decided to kill his donkey and distribute the meat among our starving men . It was in a very diseased condition , but we shot it and there was a great dividing up of the meat . It furnished each man with a good-sized piece of flesh . We EuroL peans had as our share a hind leg and the tongue , and we made some soup and stew out of it . It was very tough and had a peculiar taste , but we devoured it eager ly . The men were so starved that they fought for the entrails and cleared away every vestige of them . That evening the scouts came in and reported having come upon a large track some way inland , with blazings on it , running parallel to the river . The next morning we finished the rest of our donkey stew and started off . The men knowing that the Arab track was before them , went somewhat better than on the previous day . At mid-day we stopped to rest and had the last of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting there , word came back from Stanley that he had struck the Arab track and was following it up . I find the following entry in my journal on that day , October 16th : " Stanley is very glad about reaching the blazed track , and is confident we shall reach the Arabs in two days time . During all this time his anxiety has been frightful ; for the success of the expedition has been , and is indeed , hanging in the balance . Here he has a starved and worn-out people with no food but these miserable beans . Nelson , withfifty-six people and eighty-one loads , are left behind , and their chances of being relieved are daily growing less and less . The five chiefs who went ahead to look for food have not been heard of ; lJledi and the boat 's crew are on the river making their way up in search of the Arabs ; fifty sick men are left behind at lJgarrowa 's settlement ; and Barttelot and the rest of the men and officers are probably working their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have . The expedition is in fact entirely split up , and God alone knows whether it will ever be reunited . " We were now following up the track which had been blazed by the Arabs ; the marks were , however , pretty old , and the track was so tangled with undergrowth that we often came near losing it and had to proceed slowly , sending men ahead to look out for blazed trees . At one place the whole column was routed by a nest of hornets , which stung the men most frightfully . We had passed a good many of these hornet nests in the forest , and when we saw them in time , invariably gave them a wide berth . They usually hung from the branches of trees near ruuning water , and were ordinarily three feet long and two feet in diameter ; they looked as if they were made of brown paper . The slightest movement in the bushes near , or even the voices of people speaking , was sufficient to cause an instant sortie from the nest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury . In this case none of us caught sight of the nest , when suddenly we saw the foremost men throw down their loads and dash into the thick underwood , beating themselves madly with green boughs . The hornets were instantly upon the rest of us and completely routed the whole column . Everyone left the path and fled through the bushes , children howled , and women shrieked , and all seemed as if they had gone mad . One poor old man in my company must have had fifty stings on his naked body , and in order to protect himself he threw himself into a stream close by , where he lay roaring with the hornets buzzing about him . In his weakened state the effect of the stings and cold water were too much for him , and that night he died . We all collected some four hundred yards ahead on the track and waited a couple of hours , till the hornets had settled // down again ; we then returned one by one , and each man cautiously picked up his load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost another man , who fell from a high tree up which he had climbed to gather fruit . He was so crushed that he was unable to move , and we were forced to leave him , for it was as much as we could do to drag ourselves along . One of the most distressing things was to see a man , with whom we had worked in close companionship for so many weeks , fall by the way , and be obliged to pass b*r on the other side without helping him , for it was now a case of sauve qui peut . One morning , two days after this , we heard the gums going ahead , and knew that Stanley had at last struck the Arab camp and was firing a salute , as is the custom in Africa on meeting strangers . What a relief ! for we knew there was now food and rest for our starving and worn-out people . We hurried on and soon emerged froi*a the interminable , hateful bush , and came into great fields of rice and Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost a mile distant , we could see the Arab village . This one clearing alone must have been five hundred acres in extent . On reaching it we found Stanley seated on an antelope skin in the verandah of the chief 's house , while all the people , men , women , and children had crowded round to hear our story . The chief 's name was Khainis ; he was a Manyema and a slave of a Zanzibar Arab named Abed ben Salim , whose bloody deeds were a theme of conversation in the bazaars of Zanzibar . He was now on a pilgrimage to Mecca , but before starting had despatched Khamis and a large number of Manyema slaves , armed with percussion guns , in search of slaves and ivory . They had left Kasongo , in Manyema , more than a year and a half before ; they had wandered about the forest for many months , and had finally made their settlement here in the district called Ipoto . They were all of the usual type of Manyema , and their sleek satiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food . They were all clothed in very pretty shirts and clothes , made of grass and fibre of the palm leaf woven into extremely pretty patterns and dyed different colors . Here we sat some time and exchanged news ; we told our story and they told us theirs ; huts were given us ; and then began our life in the Manyema camp , of which I propose to write , together with the relief of Nelson , in another article.
