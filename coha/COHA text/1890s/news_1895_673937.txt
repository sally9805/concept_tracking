txt Of the leaders in the Conservative Party in England Mr. Balfour is likely to get from the recent remarkable triumph the greatest credit and the severest task . His uncle , Lord Salisbury , the titular head of the party , occupies a position in politics curiously analogous to his position in the House of Lords , one at once of power and of safety . He represents the Tory sentiment , and though he has had the astuteness to accept the alliance with the Liberal-Unionists , he represents little else than Tory sentiment , and the alliance he only accepted ; he Was quite incapable of forming it . He is by no means a blind Tory , and his Toryism is a very different thing from that of the day of Disraeli 's " brute vote . " He is. probably incapable of breaking with his allies openly in the hour of triumph , but he would have been very glad to get back into power without Mr. Chamberlain and even without the much less trying Duke of Devonshire . Had it been left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bided his time until the tide turned , and would not have incurred obligations to the Liberal-Unionists which he may fulfill honorably , but which he will certainly find irksome . The alliance , so far as the Conservatives are concerned , it3 largely the work of Mr. Balfour , who brought to politics something of the detachment of mind developed in his study , where he had ' shed much of whatever party or class prejudice he may have inherited . To him the game was worth winning as quickly and as brilliantly as possible , and he was keenly alive to the fact that the day of lasting aristocratic domination was as completely closed in Great Britain as the day of stage coaches . Moreover , he has given much evidence of a desire to see his party become  --  to borrow Earl Rosebery 's unlucky phrase  --  the " dominant partner " in ' a really national political organization , with positive aims , not content to serve solely as a check and to be called upon at uncertain intervals . It was in this spirit that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for the LiberalUnionists and the Conservatives , not merely in resistance to what both parties regarded as the disintegrating influence of Glaastonian home rule , but in promoting a common purpose as to domestic , colonial , and  --  though less distinctly ? foreign policy . Doubtless in this effort he has found himself in closer sympathy with the Duke of Devonshire than ' with Mr. Chamberlain . But he has had the sagacity to get on with the former as well as with the latter , and rather better with both than they have with each other . Now that the Conservatives are to have a majority in the Commons , without the Liberal-Unionists , over the English and Irish Gladstonians , and may even have a majority over these and the LiberalUnionists , the temptation will be very great for the more ambitious and headstrong of the Conservatives to " drop " their allies . It is beyond reasonable doubt that Mr. Balfour would resist any movement to that end , and though his task will be a difficult one , we look to see him perform it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless foreign affairs shall dominate English interests , and turn the public mind away from home questions , the House of Commons will be an arena in which the Conservatives will find it very hard to maintain their ascendency without Mr. Balfour 's leadership . He . is about the only great Parliamentary leader they have , and unquestionably he is the most capable they have had since Disraeli 's time . Not only does he have a remarkable hold on the House , but he keeps constantly in mind the effect of what . he says and does upon public opinion outside the Chamber . Indeed , this seems to be what gives the game any charm in his eyes , and he has attained his curious success chiefly by his attention to it . He has given no sign of being at all interested in the ordinary views or feelings of the Conservative Party , while he has gone out of his way frequently to acknowledge with emphasis the excellence of some of the ends professed by his opponents . A man of this spirit , feeling the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare of the country to depend on preventing the absolute domination of narrow Toryism in the new Government , will not easily be defeated .
