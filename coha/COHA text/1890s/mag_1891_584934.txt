txt T is easy to conclude , * . when one looks at the amount of building that Americans do nowadays , that there is here a great and general interest in architecture . Yet it is also easy to suppose such an interest when the real spring of activity is somewhere else . Interest in architecture there is among architects ; in building among the public . But architecture is more than building ; and I am led to suspect that a real architectural interest is almost as esoteric and professional as an interest in abstract law or medicine . A certain cultivated class takes pride , and doubtless I* leasure , in the architecture of its ouses ; the clergy and the faithful in their churches . When a striking public building is put up it attracts admiration . But I do not notice that after its first nine-days ' wonderment many nonprofessional eyes linger on the buildings as eyes linger on what delights them . You may see a crowd gather about a shop-window to admire the merchandise , or the seamstress , or pastrycook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often see a man pausing on the other side of the street to study the building . The architect may have written it over with his best thought and feeling ; its business occupants will make haste to cover it up with signs , sparing nothing but the light ; and this is not done carefully or regretfully , as if it were an unwelcome necessity of business , but as a matter of course , and as if it involved no sacrifice . Or no sooner does the average owner have his house fairly in his hands than he is ready to turn it over to the first carpenter to make any conspicuous alteration in it that convenience calls for-not , we will say , in contempt for its architectural harmony , but with a thoughtlessness for it which is almost as contumelious . If there is a part on which he dwells with abiding admiration , ten to one it is some matter of furnishing or decoration , of paint or upholstery , a thing which adds its charm to architecture but is unessential to it . Our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with the realization of bigness and an impression of sumptuousness they are satisfied , and they do not stop to look beyond . I am not deprecating lack of professional understanding of architecture , or of historical discrimination of styles ; but want of care for those qualities of design that belong to all good architecture . This kind of interest we believe to be essential to general appreciation of any art . It is not enough to say , as a purist may , that in a country where architecture had a higher development , and the average work was more excellent , the lack would not exist . It is uphill work to develop a fine art in a people that is indifferent to it and uncritical of it ; fine architecture has grown up in the past only where the people , or at least large communities of them , put heart into it . This was the case , I suppose , among the Greeks of the preAlexandrine period , among the faithful followers of the Church in the twelfth century , among the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so we may doubt the reality of general concern for the art in the face of more evidence than we see here and now . How is this doubt consistent , one may // ask , with the undeniable advance in all the arts which we see about us ; with the great attention given them in print and in speech ; the abundance of pictures , decoration , and statues ; the lavish expenditure in architecture beyond the necessities of building ? The attention , the abundance , the expenditure are beyond question-perhaps as great as we can look for except among a people which has also abundant leisure , or with whom art is directly in the service of their chief concern , as it was in the mcdiseval Church . But our phase of activity is peculiar . The things which attract our people to art are the ornamental element and the realistic . The realistic element attracts in all stages of artistic development , at least in all but the most technically cultivated ; the ornamental , sufficiently pervasive in all , is especially characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no dread of hot water might say that , as far as concerns the public , our appreciation of art is akin to the barbaric . Everything that makes for splendor-color , ornamental effect , decorative material-commands attention . The popular art is decorative ; the favorite decorator is he who has most contrivances of new materials , mechanical novelties , and the most opulent color ; the favorite source of inspiration is the art of the East , which lives by color and not by design . In painting the attraction is not figure-painting , which works by form-unless it be in pronounced realism , or in genre , which combines realism and decoration-but landscape , which gives the greatest range of color and picturesque effect with the minimum of drawing . To this obliquity of taste-I do not use the word contemptuously , but to imply a one-sided vision  --  to this obliquity of taste the arts of form and design are under eclipse . Sculpture , the art of form pure and simple , in spite of the efforts of a few able artists , does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decadent abroad . Portraiture apart , the average American at home has eyes only for the graveyard angel or for Rogers 's statuettes ; the travelling American is called upon to admire the salacious or tortured realism of Falgui*re or Bodin , or the inanities of Italian ace-carvers . If there is sculpture that attracts him , it is the animal sculpture of Barye or Cain . Architecture , the art of form applied to design , or of design applied to form if you will , made indispensable by its ministry to practical wants , calls out a passing admiration by its bulk or its ornament , when there is enough of either , but its essential qualities are under eclipse . Its essential qualities , I say . We need not spend much time discussing these qualities , but it is worth while to recall them briefly . Its chief distinction is that it is purely creative . The world was full of pictures before there were eyes to see them ; animal forms , which are the sculptor 's material , came when eyes came : but until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a palace on the earth . Architecture is more absolutely creative than any other human art except music , and so is sharply distinguished from its sister arts of painting and sculpture , which are primarily arts of observation . In an age which is pre-eminently an age of observation and of science , it is natural that the arts of observation should be dominant , and that realism in art should be stimulated by the habit of observation . In an age that is devoted to mechanical achievement , it is natural that the creative faculties should have their chief activity in mechanical and scientific contrivance . So we find that in architecture the side that is stimulated and appreciated by the public is naturally the mechanical side , the provision for material wants , and that the other side is eclipsed ; while in the arts of observation-in sculpture , in painting , and in literature as it is represented by poetry , the drama , and the novel-realism dominates . There is no realism in the art of architecture ; the creative element occupies the whole field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , the personal element , is so absolutely incarnated . In painting and in sculpture there is room enough for the personal expression of the artist ; it marks the difference between his work and another 's , and gives to his productions their value , though it is overlaid by nature 's forms , and only indirectly revealed through them . But in the architect 's // work the personal element is anobscured save by the color of his material , and the modifications which mechanical laws induce in his design . The design is the expression of the human creative power in his work , and this creative power is not simply that of the individual architect who planned the building , but of the myriad forerunners whose slow evolution furnished the artistic forms in which his design is expressed . It is a truism to say that the architecture is the design , and it might seem superfluous to urge these considerations ; yet it is exactly the design that is most ignored in the common estimate of architecture . For the architect , the proportions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded , to an inch perhaps , by the mass of his facade ; his shaft and capital are nicely gauged by the proportions of the arch they carry or the tower they decorate ; his cornices and string-courses are graduated to the height of his facade ; their smallest mouldings feel the same influence in their subdivisions ; but how many observers see this ? I think there is a common impression that the architect 's detail is , after all , rather unimportant . Yet no good artist , I believe , makes his details unimportant in the part of his work which he most values . The landscape painter may slight the details of form , if form is not what he is after ; but he takes endless pains that the reflection of a cloud in his river shall have the right relation of value and color to the cloud above . I heard an architect object one day to a sculptor 's pedestal that , though the outline was good , the mouldings and ornaments were ill-adjusted . " Oh , well ! " answered another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good the detail does not matter much . " The natural rejoinder was , " How would you like that doctrine applied to your own art ? " Is a musician content with a performance of Beethoven 's or Chopin 's music in which the main lines of the composition are followed , but the details are ill-rendered and slip-shod ? In architecture , where , as in music , design is everything , detail , out of which the whole is composed , however simple it may be , is never unimportant . The skilful architect is not he who merely gives his masses a good outline-this is not very diffleult if one cares to do nothing else  --  but he who , having done this , fills his outlines with parts agreeable in themselves and in harmonious adjustment , down to the smallest , with the whole and with each other . The eye that observes a work of architecture and does not take account of its detail , is an eye which does not appreciate its design , that is , its essence . In truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us Americans , in spite of unmistakable progress in other directions , design is the quality that is in eclipse . The prevailing craze for what we like to call decorative design depends on color , material , magnificence ; while for the design decorative material is chucked together -I can use no more complimentary word-with a disregard of form and adaptation which we may call helpless or arrogant , as we prefer . Skilful design is no passport to favor ; ugliness or clumsiness no bar , if only color is effective and material attracts . We might wonder that this condition should follow all the instruction and monition that have been lately poured upon the public in books and magazines . Let us see if these have not had something to do in provoking it . The literary awakening in art came a generation ago , in a season of depression and formalism , like the stimulus of a cold plunge to a languid man . It brought the gospel of sincerity in art , of devotion to nature , of common-sense ; in the arts of architecture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble was that being esoteric , and aiming especially to instruct amateurs , its teaching soon hardened into a decalogue as formal as the old tradition it attacked , but less artistically operative . Its precepts , in the main wholesome , were of great convenience to many people , for in art , as in algebra , it is easier to remember rules than to understand processes or to judge of results . The popular fallacy was that they were productive of art , whereas , useful as many of them were for restraint , they did not produce or teach art any more than penal statutes produce or teach the active virtues . No high-mindedness or sincerity ever gave a painter power to // lay a beautiful color or bring two lines into harmony ; no constructive fitness ever enabled an architect to proportion an arch or a column ; nor did use and common-sense ever teach a decorator to give beautiful shape to a bracket . In fact , the discussions and teachings were of a nature to divert attention from the essentials of design and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their trust in them were like a man who should go about dressed in a hat-box instead of a hat . Things were done every day , in dutiful obedience to Mr. Buskin 's precepts , that would draw from him inkstandfuls of pungent denunciation if he could see them ; and Mr. Eastlake had his name associated with more ugly furniture , I suppose , than was ever seen in equal time . The awakening was short . The teachers who thought to establish a new gospel produced only a new fashion , as fleeting as other fashions . The criticism that was based on their teachings broke down ; their precepts , thrown into discredit , were brought to naught by the exaggeration of their devotees . It was natural that the older canons of design , which had their value , being once flouted and displaced should be forgotten ; that design itself , being so cheapened , should be first misprised and then neglected . It will be long , perhaps , before the public will give it again the place that belongs to it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and criticism , which , ignoring artistic effect as they conceived it , dealt only with ethical maxims and rules of propriety , was natural ; for , while such criticism insists magisterially upon things which to them are secondary , it is apt to overlook the objects for which they chiefly work . If a critic sees that his painter 's sheep are as big as his hay-stacks , he is right to remind him of the blemish . But if the painter has put his whole heart into getting the right scale of color and values in his distance , he marks for incompetent the critic who does not see this greater thing , and is likely to sniff at all he says . So the architect , when he has worked his hardest to refine the proportions of his faqade and of his detail , loses patience at the critic who can only scold him for an unnecessary pilaster , and is not much better satisfied with the painter who looks at nothing but the color-stains on his wall . So much have artists , like writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become common to insist that criticism of any work of art should be merely exegetical ; that its only fit office is to set forth the purpose of the artist and to explain his work ; that praise or blame is impertinence in any critic . This again is excathedra doctrine , applied at the other end . It stretches the theory of plenary inspiration much too far . Its legitimate conclusion is that the artist himself is his own best critic , for he best knows what he undertakes to do , and can most completely explain it . Without going the length of this extreme doctrine , we may say that the artist 's point of view can not safely be neglected ; that criticism which neglects it can not help being one-sided-that is , distorted  --  and therefore is likely to be false . That architecture , like other arts , has suffered from this kind of criticism , needs no telling ; probably it has suffered more than the others , for its critics ' point of view has , since the literary awakening I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way of presenting architecture of which we have seen a good deal lately , that might be instructive to the architect in showing him how other men and other artists look at his work . I mean the illustration of architecture , and especially the drawing of architecture , by artists who are not architects . The drawing of any object , we may say , is a kind of analytical criticism . The more intelligently skilful it is , the more analytical it is . The painter or draughtsman knows that he can not record all he sees ; he would not if he could . His first preoccupation is to analyze his subject ; to see what is most important and characteristic in it ; to set this forth convincingly ; to subordinate , and even to suppress , the unimportant or the insignificant . The way in which this is done , the differing quality of the analysis gives , even more than differences of technique , the distinctive character to the painter 's work . Now Nature can // bear a good deal of analyzing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if a painter , from his extreme point of view , does her injustice in a one-sided representation , she outlives him , and another painter , with a different point of view , comes to counteract him . If a concert-player misrepresents the work of a composer , the next who follows may set the public right . But it is not so when an artist in a picture makes permanent record of the work of another . It is easy in this case for the illustrator-just as easy as for the literary critic-from the mere habit of fixing his attention on other things than those which preoccupy his victim , to misrepresent his work , and so in perfect innocence to do him injustice . There is less danger of this where the illustrated artist is a sculptor ; for the painter , accustomed like the sculptor to working from the human figure , knows that its forms are not to be trifled with , while the forms which the architect uses have no such acknowledged sanctity . Some architectural exhibitions-that is , exhibitions of architectural drawings - have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of attention from artists and the public . It has been curious to note how spectators have concerned themselves with the drawings as drawings , and not with the architecture ; how notices of the press have taken account of them as pictures , not as portraits ; how , if any have been specially admired , it has been for qualities that go to make a picture-for color , freshness , clever handling of brush or pen . Scarcely a critic in the press , even in the leading architectural papers , so far as I have seen , has troubled himself about what was the first test of merit in the drawings , their excellence as representations of architecture , or , what was still more important , the design of the architecture itself . This brings us back to the proposition with which I set out , that the public , to which I am afraid we must add even the painters , cares little for architecture for its own sake . Some years ago , when The Century Magazine undertook to illustrate some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors found that it was impossible to get from its corps of illustrators drawings that were satisfactory to the architect himself . The artists were the best of their kind in the country ; but the subjects were new to them , the architect 's intention was not evident to them , the qualities on which he relied for his effects were out of their ken , their way of handling their drawings did not suit the subjects . Their habit was the habit of all painters-and for this discussion I class all illustrators with painters  --  to work from nature , and to look first for the characteristics of nature in whatever invites representation . The painter of to-day , chiefly a painter of landscape , is trained as a devotee of nature . The old traditions of composition , chiaro-oscuro and effect , under which the older painters relentlessly tinkered whatever nature set before them , are rubbish and impediments to our painters , whose glory it is to paint just what they see . What they see is what they have learned to see , and their learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore it requires from them , I think , a distinct and steady effort , if they paint a building , to remember that it is first a work of art , and that the designer 's intention-his point of view , his design-is , on the right theory of criticism , to be kept all the time in mind . There is a stumbling-block in the fact that the material with which the architect works , his brick or stone , is itself a work of nature , or soon becomes so , and challenges the painter 's attention as such . No sooner has a building left the architect 's hand than Nature begins to efface his touch and to substitute her own . To the painter her finger-marks are very tempting . To him the building is first of all a pile of stones ; its mass , its color , its light and shade , its value in the picture , are his chief concern . So far as a building is only a part of a picture , an adjunct or secondary constituent , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not a picture of architecture . But when the architecture is the picture , the conscientious painter will remember that he is not drawing-expounding , we may say-a work of nature , but a work of art , and // must , if he will expound it fairly , search out his fellow-artist 's point of view . I give prominence to the painter in this discussion because painting is now the dominant art ; so much so that painters give the law to the public taste in matters of art , and even the name of artists is often applied to them with exclusive meaning , as if there were no others . All through the earlier history of civilization it was otherwise-architecture dominated . The great masters of the Renaissance first raised the other arts to equal importance ; after them painting gradually eclipsed her sisters ; architecture and sculpture are still under eclipse . Not only does painting absorb the public interest and appreciation of art , but it influences , and in many respects controls , the practice of the other arts . The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dreamed of , owes its inspiration to painting , and largely even to the technics of painting . An artist like Jimgling , whom we have just lost , was impossible under the old order of things . So the painter-etchers , as they are called , have carried the day over the old-fashioned etchers , and following the path pointed out by Rembrandt , have diverted their art from the study of line to the study of tints and values . Taking it into the service of modern landscape , they have done many things that were not done before , but they have left undone many good things that were done . I do not argue as some critics have argued , Mr. Buskin , for instance , that the attempt to give light and shade with the needle is itself improper-that the modern devices of retroussage and artistic printing are the tricks of a charlatan . The richness of tint that modern etching gives has great beauty , and has not been got in any other way . But architects may well unite with those who insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to throw away the most characteristic and spirited means of expression which the needle puts into the etcher 's hand . It would be a distinct loss to art if the works of such an etcher as Brunet-Desbaines were lost ; but it will be a distinct crippling of the etcher 's power if the expressiveness , the play , and the asso ciation of lines which gave vivacity to the works of the older masters are neglected and forgotten in the pursuit of qualities of light and shade and texture . However great the compensations of this exchange in landscape or genre , in architectural etching the loss is very serious . A great deal of such etching has been published lately , and the predominance in it of the picturesque over the architectural element increases . M6ryon made architectural etchings which were admirable as far as they went , and Rochebrune 's more ambitious work , lacking the fascinating freedom of M6ryon 's and forced in tone , still gave the real qualities of architecture in a way that is a model for a draughtsman ; but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose pen and brush drawings are admirable , seems to me in his etchings to stagger between the picturesque and the architectural ; while even Haig , whose earlier etchings are superb in vigor and truthfulness of drawing , now absorbed in tones and picturesque accessories , though too thorough a draughtsman not to draw well what he draws at all , is becoming a painter-etcher , and his later works are losing their architectural value . Our architects and students show the prevailing influence conspicuously ; they are not much given to the study of tones and values-they might do more of it to advantage  --  but they are severely bitten by the picturesque . They sketch profusely and do as little drawing as they can . Freedom and vivacity of touch , broken line , lightness of handling , a painter-like quality of effect-these are the characteristics they aim at , and they are too apt to allow only so much architectural character as will not withdraw attention from them . Modern reproductive methods , giving the artist 's handling with fascinating clearness , are a demoralizing temptation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled , but with the finest architectural beauty evaporated out of them . I have seen one or two accomplished draughtsmen perverted by Herbert Ilailton 's brilliant sketches till they can not or will not draw a building as it looks to an architect . // We see buildings which have centuries of firm endurance in them , and show it , drawn as if the first frost would crumble them to pieces ; buildings that are to be built to-morrow are presented as if age and decrepitude were already upon them ; walls are battered and worn , and roofs that should be covered with solid slate or tiling are drawn as if they were built of pie - crust and flaking into decay . This is not architectural drawing , it is scene-painting . I will not scold about the fashion . The world is wide and art is long ; there is room for many phases of art . The phase I speak of is an attractive one , but it is not architectural . If works of architecture are to be depicted at all , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect 's point of view , shall be made clear in them , as it is , when a painter 's works are engraved , that his intention and point of view be made clear . Not only the drawing of architecture is influenced by the painter 's habit , the actual conception , the design , feels it also . And here let us acknowledge the great debt which architecture owes to painting in this generation for the revival of its color . The development of landscape painting found us building , here and in England , in blank colorlessness-indeed , all over Christendom it was much the same . The romantic movement of the last generation , with its mediæval revival , is greatly responsible for the flush of color which has spread over this generation , but the impetus and guidance have come from the painters . They have even taken the matter freely into their hands , and have decorated our buildings for us with a novel splendor . If in so doing they have played havoc with architectural forms , we can , for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seems now in a way to avenge itself by a reaction to greater formalism and a milder use of color than we have seen of late . Let us only hope that the irresponsibility of their patronage will not lead to the discrediting of their gift of color . But it is in more than the after-decoration of his work that the architect feels the painter 's influence , or at least the influence of the force which moves the painter . The spirit of the picturesque has prevailed in English and American architecture for two generations , and to such an extent that not only our country-houses , where this quality is germane , but our civil and church buildings , have been wild with irregularity , and pied with all the variety of turrets , gables , chimneys , dormers , and bay-windows that an overstocked repertory could furnish . Not only this , the eagerness for the qualities which painters love has spent itself in fulness of color , variety of texture , coarseness of materials , even a studious carelessness of workmanship , and a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " C'est joli , mais ce n'est pas l'architecture , " is the rough-and-ready verdict of the most architectural of peoples on modern English and American work . That this picturesque work is not architecture is hardly true , but it is true that it is only a small phase of it . It is the side-show of architecture , that part of it which can be practised , not with full success but with a certain effect , by persons who are not architects at all . Unfortunately the attention which is concentrated on it is withdrawn from the more masculine and more characteristic phases of the art . I remember hearing a critic abuse the modern architecture of Paris as worthless , because there was no picturesqueness in it . Picturesqueness ! If he had said that it lacked dignity and seriousness and purity , that when it was vivacious it was apt to be meretricious , and when it was quiet it was too often banale , he might have had standingroom for an argument . But picturesque ! Was picturesqueness the glory of the Parthenon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris owes its splendid beauty , or the dome of St. Peter 's , or the front of the Farnese Palace ? Note again that I am not decrying the picturesque . It is against absorption in it that I protestabsorption that shuts the eyes to higher and nobler qualities of design . There is fine architecture that is picturesque , but to the highest its picturesqueness , if it is there , is no more an essential than is the lace that lies upon the shoulders of a courtly beauty . // The transformation wrought in sculpture by the same influence is obvious . Picturesqueness and realism have taken possession of her also . But the line of development which was natural for painting is , I think , unnatural for her , and she has followed with stumbling a path which was unsuited for her feet . The latest French sculptors-Fr6miet , Falguil*re , Rodin-for instance , seem to me painters in masquerade . Painters even take up sculpture when it suits them , and hardly change their manner . A score of years ago , when Landseer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the critics found fault with his painter-like and unsculpturesque treatment . Now I fancy it would be taken as a thing of course . The very technical qualities which win attention in sculpture are analogous to those of paintingtexture and the artist 's touch hold first place . The model in clay or the terracotta is better liked than the finished marble , because it shows the handling of the sculptor , it lends itself to picturesque and instantaneous manipulation , and it has color . Next to it is bronze , for like reasons . Without waiting to discuss the merits of this tendency , I may argue that it diverts attention from abstract beauty of form , which had been in earliest ages the first object in sculpture . It confuses the boundaries of the beautiful and the ugly ; and , in fact , the most serious charge that lies against modern sculpture , as against much of the other realistic art of to-day , is that in too catholic devotion to the real , which is the ordinary , it is obscuring the sense of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , the different arts were more interdependent than now , and were practised even by the same men . The great masters of the Renaissance were architects and sculptors , painters and architects , painters and sculptors , and occasionally all three ; but the conditions were different . Architecture and sculpture were up to that time dominant . Form and composition were the chief preoccupation in all the arts . Color was secondary , at least until the Venetian school ; the picturesque was undiscovered ; landscape was an accessory . The Renaissance painters were used to painting walls and ceilings ; their greatest works were combined with architecture , and allied themselves to it by natural affinity , partook of its firmness , its balance , its orderly arrangement , its repose . These painters even felt the need of strongly marked and rigid architectural features to bear out the composition of their frescos , and reconcile them to the buildings to which they were applied . When Giotto undertook to paint the Arena Chapel and Michael Angelo the Sistine , each found ready to his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched ceiling , without any architectural feature , even so much as a moulding , to interrupt its continuity . Each first set to work to adapt his composition by laying out bands of architectural detail to justify its arrangement . Michael Angelo went so far as to paint in an elaborate scheme of simulated architectural features to which his pictures were to conformfeatures not satisfactory , as if they had been worked in stone or in stucco , but yet necessary in his judgment to give motive for the arrangement of his figures and bring them into relation with the building . The modern painter , unused to adapt his work to any conditions but those of his own palette , incloses his painting with a wall of gilded wood , the wider the better , on purpose to isolate it as absolutely as possible from all its surroundings ; but Michael Angelo , who disdained easel-painting as an art for women ( being no colorist ) , made the most sympathetic adaptation he could of the paintings to the building . How hard it is for the modern painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred examples . In his great painting of the tribune in the grand hall of the Sorbonne , in Paris , Puvis de Chavannes had to cover the back of a shallow niche ceiled with a low semi-dome . The sharply indicated descending ribs cry out for recognition and support as the price of harmony in the architecture of the room , but Chavannes , who wanted to make a broad composition , has disregarded the divisions and covered the whole wall with an unbroken landscape filled with'figures . The composition , too large to be effective without subdivision , is cut into three groups by the trunks of foreground trees set , not under the ribs , // but just between them , so as to emphasize the dislocation . The effect is as if fifty or sixty feet of wall were knocked away , leaving the dome to be held up by the stiffness of the cornice , and a landscape hung behind the opening , stretching into a far-away perspective . And we have recently been told by the newspapers that M. Rodin has submitted a design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the commission appointed to pass upon it have thought necessary to reject because it did not harmonize with the classic architecture of the building . The style of Bodin 's other work , in which realism and romanticism are curiously blended , makes it easy to believe that his design was appropriate to Victor Hugo . The description of the design  --  a figure of the poet sitting pensively upon a rock , with waves breaking at his feet , and three allegorical figures poised above his head , suggests that the exception of the commission was well taken , and it is encouraging to hear that iRodin is to modify it in the interest of harmony . But there is significance also in the fact that his fellow-artists , who perhaps concern themselves little about the architure of the Pantheon , are said to protest vigorously against the exclusion . The extreme of dislocation between architecture and its decorative painting is found perhaps in the overhead painting of the later masters of the Renaissance themselves , whose sky-like domes and open , wind-blown ceilings keep up a conjugal quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need only mention the preposterous extravagances of Tiepolo and the later Venetians . Still , so long as painters were primarily figure painters , they felt the human element in architecture , and when they put buildings into their pictures , as Veronese and other Venetians were fond of doing , they looked at them from the architect 's point of view . The earlier landscape painters who represented buildings , looked at them in the same way , as works of art and not of nature , while the painter of to-day is apt to paint only the natural surface of the building , and to leave out its architecture . The painter 's point of view is the point of view of the public . Americans go abroad to admire famous buildings , but we find them in greater rapture over the mouldering ruins of Melrose or the confectionery of Roslin Chapel , than over the majesty of Chartres or the graceful dignity of an Italian facade . They thrill at the historical associations of the Coliseum , or the crowd of ugly memorials that disfigures Westminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris Cathedral or of Amiens do not stir them . If it is explained that the public prefers nature to architecture , this is what I am arguing . If one says that the beauty of nature or of painting the interest of human history , are higher than the beauty or interest of the architect 's art , this I do not stop to argue ; I only say that the man whose love of architecture rests on the historic or the picturesque , and who can not be moved to admiration by mere proportion of fair surface and firm line , who has not enthusiasm for the swinging cornice of a rounded apse , or the unruffled outline of the tower that soars above it , this man has no appreciation of architecture ; he does not know what it is . If the current of public interest , especially in our country , has swept away from his art , the architect must console himself with remembering that this is the momentary fortune of war ; that his art has had its turn , and will have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is indispensable . He may find some philosophic consolation in reflecting that if his work is somewhat overlooked it is also inchoate . American architecture has not yet taken definate shape , its practitioners are in the mass less developed , less skilful , than those of some other countries . It may not be a grief without compensation that , while his work is thus taking shape , the public should not be a too zealous or a too knowing critic of it . We may expect him , then , to stand up for his own art in its distinctive character , to insist upon his own point of view , which is fixed by the experience of many centuries ; setting forth his art as , before all things , an art of design , in which proportion and form hold first place . And since painting is now the // dominant art , and he is really under obligation to her , it calls for some steadiness in him not to import into his own work so much of her qualities as to overbear those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now most in danger is one that is most unpopular among painters - a certain clear , uncompromising firmness of form that in painting would be harshness , but which is vital to the manliness of architecture , befitting its materials and its primary function of shelter . Painting , in truth , is essentially an indoor art , architecture primarily an outdoor art . The accompaniments of painting are the guarded light , the repose , the amenity of the drawing-room or the gallery . Architecture 's attendants are the blazing sun , the cloud , the wind , and the storm . Painting requires protection ; architecture exists to afford it . Hence a certain sternness of temper is natural to the one which is foreign to the other . Painting has a dramatic faculty which enables it on occasion to assume every variety of expression , yet it has its abiding characteristics behind this , and they differ from those of architecture . Softness , languor , extreme delicacy , the appearance of fragility , are effeminacy in architecture , the most virile of the arts . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but firmness and the obvious power of resistance it can not spare . The harshest criticism I have ever heard on certain noted works of architecture , Giotto 's beautiful tower at Florence , for instance , and the famous Antwerp spire , is that they look as if they ought to be kept in glass-cases . The building that has to fight the storms of centuries ought to need no coddling ; it should look firm and full of resistance ; if it looks fragile it looks feeble , ana*mic , unfit for outdoor life . The squareset , soldierly tower of the old palace at Sienna , refined but uncompromising in its bearing , is to me as much manlier and finer than the lace-like spire of Antwerp as the masculine career of Cromwell or Bismarck is better than the life of Buckingham or Louis XV . Let us wish that the architect may hold fast that which is his own ; that all the artists of design , working together to give the arts a worthy place in a new country which as yet hardly knows them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advantage borrow from each other , but learn at the same time to keep unobscured , each in his own , those which give it distinction as an art , and to claim recognition for them in the general estimate . An architect is ashamed not to know what the painters and sculptors about him are working for . He likes to understand their points of view , to appreciate technically the qualities they value , the achievements they prize . It is a loss to him and to them if this appreciation is not reciprocated . One blight upon the arts in America is their narrowness . A better mutual understanding , a little more mutual admiration , would be very wholesome for them . The habit of uniting their work in the same monuments as artists have done in older times and in older countries , without elbowing , but carefully allowing each other room to swing in , is one which needs developing . It will help to bring again that stimulating brotherhood of the arts which was seen when Ictinus built the Parthenon , and Phidias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again when the cathedrals of the thirteenth century were made alive with sculpture and radiant with light and color , and once more under the splendid band of artists who illuminated the Renaissance of Italy ; but which has never returned . // Tm* line of least resistance is naturally a particularly popular one , and it is doubtless the disposition to follow it that is responsible for a phenomenon recently called to my attention by a clever woman as emiiaently characteristic just now of American society . " Have you noticed , " she said , * what a fad personal flattery has become ? " Whether one has remarked it or not , I think most observers will recognize the fact once pointed out . Preoccupation with personality is certainly an American - possibly more or less a generally modern - trait ; but our present orgy of compliment is , I think , a new variant of it . And it can not be that we are becoming Frenchified to the point of social insincerity for the mere sake of moral perversity . The truth probably is that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as social civilization spreads increasingly and penetrates our bewildering and encouraging succession of nouvelies couches- the desire to make one 's self agreeable , instead of merely important , is increasing proportionately . Now amenity as an art is a difficult one . To succeed in it demands either the " certain felicity " which Bacon affirmed to be necessary to the painter who would improve upon nature , or that long course of social civilization whereby tradition secures the sinking of effort in unconsciousness and the substitution of inherited for acquired capacities . In the absence of either of these advantages it is the shortest VOL . IX. - 14 rather than the wisest road to the end of being agreeable that is pretty sure to be taken , and the grosso rnodo pursuit of , as I said , the line of least resistance results in an amount and degree of personal flattery at the present moment which are altogether notable . We have probably not yet wholly emancipated ourselves from the wish to be appreciated , as well as to be agreeable . On the contrary , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blank and stark way sanctioned no doubt by our unquestioned sincerity , but dictated perhaps by an imperfect taste , it is probable that with our motive of being agreeable is very subtly associated a desire to be deemed discerning . We act on the assumption-so tacit , to be sure , as to be unconscious-that the fact of our appreciation of them attests to them acuteness in us . Our well-known and universally acknowledged genuineness-that heirloom inherited from the savages of the Elbe and Weser marshes-prevents our perspicacity in these circumstances from being distrusted . The person whom we are flattering is really in a sense our victim . Assured that we mean what we are saying he  --  or she-is bound to believe in our superiority of perception . And so far , occasionally , is this pushed , so closely is the victim " crowded , " that the line at which compliment becomes really patronage it is sometimes difficult definitely to draw . Every one must have THE POINT OF VIEW . // remarked , in some instances of flattery which he has observed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unctuousness , but still not quite hitting the mark neatly and delicately either . Indeed so admixed with appeal for reciprocity is excess in this way of making one 's self agreeable that it may well be doubted if the present practice is not likely to prove a passing one . It is sure to undergo essential modification so soon as it comes to be generally understood that flattery obviously in the interest of the flatterer is selfcontradictory . In a measure one ceases to be agreeable when he manifests the desire to be agreeable at any cost , to the end of satisfying his own approbativeness . It is probable that our actual attitude of Arcadian simplicity in regard to this subject really illustrates a rather rudimentary stage of social evolution , and that as we develop still further socially our compliment will become less direct , less palpable , more discreet and deft , more disposed to rely on its specific appositeness and less on the mere fact that it is compliment , and therefore entails the obligation of repayment in kind or equivalent . As we get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us illogical that merely brutally to attest the fact that a painter 's obviously good picture is excellent , or a lady 's obvious beauty or wit is admirable , should lay the person thus complimented under the weight of a sense of indebtedness . Otherwise the possessor of merit will remain , as at present , at the mercy of the appreciator of merit  --  a state of things at which reason revolts and therefore in its nature transitory.
