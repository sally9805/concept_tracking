AT FOUR O'CLOCK was first seen at private houses in Lenox and in New York . It was presented , after much rehearsal , at the Madison Square Theatre matines , January 13th and 14th , 1887 . This play requires brisk action and perfect knowledge of the lines . It should , therefore , not be put on hastily to fill a gap in some programme . Where so many actors are at once upon the stage , each having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success without faithful preliminary drill . The scene is a drawing-room of modern days , furnished luxuriously ; the costumes those in ordinary use on the occasion of afternoon visits . The men wear frock-coats and carry hats and sticks . The ladies , except Mrs. Effingham who wears demitoilette , are in street costume with wraps and bonnets . Palms , screens , etc. , scattered about the scene are useful in affording opportunities for " business , " the dramatis person changing places from time to time to avoid stiffness in their grouping . Main text SCENE : A fashionable drawing-room . Thomas in the act of reading a newspaper . In one hand he holds a feather duster , in the other a Dresden figurine , which falls to the ground with a crash . Thomas stoops to pick it up , with a grimace . THOMAS .  --  Bad luck to ye now , for a murtherin ' blag-guard , to slip atween me fingers like that . Sure , an ' me lady ought to know better at her time o ' life , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow 's fingers wid scatterin ' the chaney around , for all the wurrld like a musayum .

He 's squintin ' at me ! Och , for sure , I 'll be afther clappin ' it in me pocket , and the misthress ' ll never be the wiser . Faith , an ' it 's grateful to me she might be , wid such a lot o ' them imidges as I ai n't broken yet . ( Enter Mrs. Effingham in reception toilet , R. ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  What , Thomas , not ready yet ! How often have I told you that you must be in livery before three o'clock on Mondays ! ( Catching sight of fragments on carpet . ) What is that ? An arm of my lovely Dresden figurine , that I paid such a price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .  --  Sure , mum , it 's an arrum , or a leg , or a head . I 'm that flustered wid misfortune , I ca n't adzackly make out which . ( Picks it up and hands it to Mrs. Effingham . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  And where , if I may ask , is the rest of it ? THOMAS ( taking pieces from pocket ) .  --  Here , ma'am . I was just considerin ' av it could be rightly mended ; but if ye 'd take my advice , ye 'd discard him altogether , the cross-eyed spalpeen ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  And you intended to omit the arm in restoration ? THOMAS .  --  I was only takin ' pattern by the artist that made yer statoo of the Vaynus . I 'll be afther tellin ' ye , ma'am , the way the accident occurred . I was only aisin ' me mind by reading the marnin ' paper , like this  --  And the butt end of my duster went whack , like this  --  ( Suits action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figurine is smashed . Thomas aghast . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Enough , Thomas ; you will ruin me . I am forced to give you warning . THOMAS .  --  Och , ma'am , an it 's not the Christian lady ye are that 'd be turnin ' a pore b'ye away widout a karracter , an ' all on account of his family troubles , when it 's nearly kilt I am wid just thryin ' to live , avick ! Thrue as ye 're born , ma'am , it 's from me grandfather in the ould country I got it , and he , pore man ,  --  God rest his soul ,  --  died of it , forbye the doctors , and an illigant funeral he had , as ' ud be a satisfaction to any corpse . It 's a sort of a kind of a jerking spasm , that takes me all unbeknownst when I do be not in the laste prepared . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( laughing ) .  --  Go , now , Thomas , and get yourself in condition to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the fragments of figurine in his hand . He apostrophizes them in dumb show behind Mrs. Effingham . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( drawing on her gloves , and walking to and fro to arrange chairs , lamps , flowers , etc. ) .  --  Well , here I am , booked to stay in-doors on this lovely Spring day when I would like nothing better than a turn in the park ! What a nuisance one 's day at home becomes ! The right people never come in when they are expected , or if they do't is only to run into the wrong people . I believe I 'm getting cynical How strange it is ! At fifteen one believes in eternal youth ; one mocks at the grim wolf , middle age , as he growls from afar . So the years drift on , till some fine morning one wakes up to confront the first wrinkle  --  the tiny foreshadowing of a wrinkle  --  a pencil sketch to be inked hereafter ! ( Looks nervously about her . ) I have seen it just here ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy tone ) soon every one will see it ! ( She drops into easy chair . ) Ah ! how long this afternoon will seem ! Not a soul I care to see , of course . A stream of dull people , and I , smiling here , bowing there , pouring out tea , protesting I am enchanted , when I am bored , bored , bored to death ! I ca n't understand why Arthur did n't come yesterday ; not so much as a note or a bunch of violets . I was so cold on Saturday when he said good-bye . His eyes had that deep , wounded , yearning look ! No , he will never come on my day at home , that 's certain ; he detests gossiping people . Ah ! ( rising and walking about ) society is a prison into which we are cast , as soon as we are born , and in vain we cry , " We ca n't get out ! " Alas ! ( She sighs deeply , then catching sight of her reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I thought so , and now I 'm sure of it ! ( Work her arm about in sleeve . ) This is the last dress she shall ever have from me , the horrid little fraud . That abominable Clementine has simply ruined my back ! ( Bell . ) Ah ! one of my jailers , I presume . THOMAS ( withdrawing a portire , announces ) .  --  Misther Grayson . ( Exit . ) ( Enter Grayson . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Mr. Grayson ! This is an unexpected pleasure , to welcome one of your sex so early in the day . To what happy chance do I owe it ? GRAYSON.  --  To no chance , I assure you . I 've latterly failed so often to see you , that I have made a bold effort to be your very first visitor to-day . ( Seats himself at her side . ) In fact , I 've so generally been too late , it is a comfort to find myself for once too soon . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( unfurling fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach . You know you are always welcome . GRAYSON ( aside ) .  --  Too cordial by half . But now that I 'm here , I must seize my opportunity . ( Aloud , putting down hat and stick . ) Dear Mrs. Effingham , if you could only understand what these delays and obstacles are to a man in my tortured state of mind ! Be gracious , be compassionate , and say that you will hear me ! MRS . EFFINGHAM ( aside ) .  --  I 'm afraid I 'm in for it . ( Aloud . ) One could n't be anything but gracious on such a heavenly day , Mr. Grayson . ( Rising and going to window , R. ) Oh , what an elastic atmosphere . Really , it is almost warm , do n't you think so ? GRAYSON ( ruefully picking up hat and stick ) .  --  Not at all ; I find it cool , decidedly . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( arranging flowers in window-box ) .  --  My mignonette will soon be in bloom . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who can be out-of-doors to-day , being willing to remain within . GRAYSON.  --  I refuse to take the hint . Your presence , Mrs. Effingham , makes perpetual sunshine . MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  What pretty things you always say , Mr. Grayson  --  to everybody , do n't you ? GRAYSON.  --  Crushed again ! Yes , as you were saying , the weather is fine , certainly  --  very fine ; I  --  ah  --  venture to assert , without fear of contradiction , that I never knew it finer ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Such a long , dull winter as we are having ! Do n't you find it very dull , Mr. Grayson ? ( Suppresses yawn . ) I do . GRAYSON.  --  Hum ! ha ! ( Aside . ) She sha n't get the better of me , I 'll swear ! When a man has a declaration on the tip of his tongue he 's a fool if he lets slip an opportunity like this ! ( Aloud . ) My dear Mrs. Effingham ! Adorable Lilian ! If ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intense , overmastering , it is  --  ( Bell . ) THOMAS ( withdrawing portire ) .  --  Misther Walton ! ( Enter Walton . Exit Thomas . Grayson , disgusted , takes up hat and stick and goes to window , R. ) GRAYSON ( aside ) .  --  That fool , Walton ! WALTON ( aside ) .  --  That idiot , Grayson ! ( They salute each other frigidly . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Mr. Walton ! I thought you were in Wyoming or Arizona  --  some one of those buffalo and Indian places men escape to nowadays . WALTON .  --  And so I have been ; just as far away from you as I could conveniently go . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( languidly ) .  --  Thanks , very much , I 'm sure . WALTON .  --  But we wanderers come back to New York for civilization , as whales come to the surface for air . MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Of course , you are brimful of adventures . Pray tell me the most exciting thing that happened all the time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , I got married . You would not have me , and so , finding consolation elsewhere , I jumped headlong into matrimony , as a harlequin goes through a trap . GRAYSON ( aside ) .  --  Married , by jove ! Hurrah ! ( He comes forward . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( indifferently ) .  --  Married ! I congratulate you . WALTON .  --  That is to say , I was married ; very much married  --  utterly married . But I 'm not at all so now , thank you . I 'm a despairing widower . GRAYSON ( dejectedly , aside ) .  --  The devil he is ! ( Aloud . ) I say , Walton , does that sort of luck  --  ahem !  --  I mean , blow  --  often happen to a fellow so soon in married life ? WALTON .  --  I see how you feel for me , my dear fellow . Thank you for your sympathy in my grief . GRAYSON ( who has been smiling , endeavors to be gloomy ) .  --  I ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commiseration . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( handkerchief to eyes ) .  --  And in mine . WALTON .  --  Restrain your emotion , my good friends ; keep it for a more worthy object . I am afraid I made a fiasco in that little venture . Strange ! Everybody knows what a sweet-tempered , biddable , affectionate kind of creature I am . She was reputed to be an angel . And yet , marriage is like an experiment in chemistry . Unite two harmless drugs and you have a deadly poison . GRAYSON ( sentimentally glancing at widow ) .  --  But then yours was not a love match , Walton . WALTON .  --  Love ! What , are you Arcadian enough to still believe in that exploded myth ? MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Was there ever anything so odd as the way people have of drifting into this kind of talk ? No matter what point the conversation starts from , it always ends in  --  WALTON ( cynically ) .  --  Love ! MRS . EFFINGHAM ( satirically ) .  --  Love ! GRAYSON ( tenderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Grayson , you are a believer . Give us a good definition of the tender passion . ( Aside . ) One must find something to say . ( She seats herself on sofa . Grayson leans over it from behind . Walton stands , kick to mantelpiece . ) GRAYSON ( aside ) .  --  Another opportunity . ( Aloud . ) Willingly , Mrs. Effingham . You inspire me to eloquence  --  you loosen the flood-gates  --  you uncurb the torrents , that , lava-like  --  MRS . EFFINGHAM ( interposing her fan ) .  --  Ah ! I beseech you , Mr. Grayson , no volcanoes ; no torrents  --  nothing violent or exciting . Give us a nice , comfortable , easy-going , Jog-trot sort of an emotion . GRAYSON ( discomfited , aside ) .  --  H-um , h-a-h ! This is not what I call easy-going . Devil take the woman . ( Aloud . ) Love , my dear Mrs. Effingham , is perhaps most briefly described as embodied in  --  ( Bell . ) THOMAS ( withdrawing portire ) .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of impatience ; crosses stage to examine pictures , etc . ) WALTON .  --  What , Appleby , the miser millionaire , enrolled among your slaves ! Truly , he is a formidable rival . ' T is said he is even saving of his words , which accounts for his never being able to complete a sentence . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( with lifted forefinger ) .  --  Hush ! he is here ! ( Enter Appleby . He advances to meet hostess , who rises , then resumes her seat . Appleby sits on sofa at her side , L. ) APPLEBY .  --  Mrs. Ef-Ef-Ef-ingham ! Mr. Grayson ! Mr. Walton ! ( To Walton . ) I have n't had the pleasure since we cr-cr-crossed together in the Gug-Gug-Gug  --  MRS . EFFINGHAM ( rapidly ) .  --  Delightful ship , is n't she ? I never take any other if I can help it . As you came in , Mr. Appleby , Mr. Grayson was just giving us his definition of love . No one would ever believe how eloquent and clever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Grayson . GRAYSON ( stiffly ) .  --  You will excuse me , Mrs. Effingham ; the thread of my ideas was too suddenly snapped . WALTON .  --  Will you accept my definition , instead ? MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Something chemical , I suppose ? WALTON .  --  Love is an airy nothing  --  a thistledown that a breath may blow away ! In brief , a  --  ( Bell . ) THOMAS .  --  Misthress Marabout ! ( Enter Mrs. Marabout . Exit Thomas . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( rising and coming forward ) .  --  How do you do , my dear ? So good of you not to forget my Mondays . ( Aside . ) Just came to show her new Worth wrap . ( Aloud . ) Pray sit down and throw aside your cloak . You 'll find it oppressive in this warm room . ( Offers to remove Mrs. M. 's cloak . ) MRS . MARABOUT ( resisting and out of breath. )  --  Not at all , my dear ; I 'm always a little chilly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes up Chinese fire-screen and fans herself violently . ) How pretty your rooms are , and how charmingly you 're dressed ; but you 're pale , are n't you  --  or else a little thin ? Worn out , perhaps , with keeping too late hours ? MRS . EFFINGHAM ( aside ) .  --  That 's the civil for saying I 'm a fright . ( Aloud . ) We are not all so successful in preserving our looks as long as you do , dear . By the way , your wrap is really very nice . I had n't noticed it before . I had no idea Clementine could do so well . MRS . MARABOUT ( sharply ) .  --  Clementine , indeed ! Worth 's last , my dear ; and I should think you would know the difference ! ( Fans herself . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( smoothly ) .  --  Worth ! I would n't have imagined it . Tea , Thomas ! And , Thomas , Mrs. Marabout finds the room is cool ; poke the fire . ( As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fanning herself with increasing vigor . ) WALTON ( following her , R. ) .  --  Pray , let me relieve you . ( Takes fan . ) ( Grayson and Appleby stand near Mrs. Effingham and converse with her . Enter Thomas with tea-table , which he places by Mrs. Effingham ; afterward brings in tea-tray , fashionably equipped . Mrs. Effingham makes tea . ) THOMAS ( going out , shows broken cup ) .  --  Musha , it 's lucky then , the quality do n't count their dozens . She 'll never be afther knowin ' that I 've just sint one of them egg-shell tay-cups to kape company with the broken imidges . ( Exit Thomas . ) MRS . MARABOUT.  --  So nice to see you back again , Mr. Walton . I quite envy you that delightful unconventional life you have been leading . A more primitive state of society than ours would be just what I would choose . There used to be a poem when I learned lessons , about Lo ! the poor Indian , whose something  --  mind  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in society could only go and be Indians , I would put down my name directly . But , moving in society , unfortunately we ca n't . WALTON .  --  An enormous loss to the Indians , madam . MRS . MARABOUT.  --  I often say to my husband that I am utterly unsuited to the cold atmosphere of conventional life . Such a child of nature ; the weakest of creatures  --  my feelings touched in a moment . Yes , sugar , please ; and cream , Mr. Appleby . ( She sips tea which Appleby crosses to hand her . ) Often and often I sob for hours together , for no reason in the world . WALTON ( aside ) .  --  Uncommonly cheerful for Marabout , I swear . ( Aloud ) Highly interesting for the doctors , is it not ? MRS . MARABOUT.  --  Doctors ! Do n't speak to me of doctors ! I 've baffled them all ! One of my pet peculiarities is an objection to the smell of certain flowers . Hyacinths , for instance , make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . ) I would wager anything there is a hyacinth in that vase yonder . Oh , this terrible oppression !  --  water !  --  eau de cologne !  --  anything !  --  all grows dark before me . ( She droops . Walton , with a gesture of dismay , receives her in his arms . ) WALTON ( aside ) .  --  For a creature all sensibility she 's no light weight . ( Places her on sofa . ) ( All surround Mrs. Marabout . Mrs. Effingham applies usual remedies . Appleby seizes the milk-jug , but dust brush from the hearth . As the invalid revives Mrs. Effingham brings near the vase of flowers , hiding them behind her . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Are you relieved now , dear , and you are quite sure it was the scent of those naughty hyacinths ? MRS . MARABOUT ( faintly ) .  --  Oh ! that fatal hyacinth ! O Lilian , what would I give for nerves like yours ! MRS . EFFINGHAM ( distinctly ) .  --  My nerves are proof against hyacinths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslin . ( She shows the vase . ) Artificial , my dear Julie , as you see ! ( All laugh . Confusion of Mrs. Marabout . Bell . ) THOMAS ( withdrawing the portire ) .  --  Mistress Coddington and Miss Coddington ! ( Exit Thomas . Enter Mrs. Coddington and her daughter ; they greet hostess and cross , R. ) MRS . CODDINGTON ( to daughter , aside ) .  --  Now , Arabella , mind what I say , and whatever you do , do n't let the conversation flag ; keep the ball moving ; be gay , sprightly , artless , agreeable , and suave . ARABELLA ( helplessly , aside ) .  --  But if I 've nothing to say , mamma ? MRS . CODDINGTON ( sharply , aside ) .  --  Nothing to say , forsooth ! Nothing to say ! And how dare you presume , miss , to have nothing to say ? Keep your wits about you , miss , or when we get home again , I 'll have something to say ! ( Conversation around tea-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take his leave . ) WALTON ( to Mrs. Effingham , aside ) .  --  What the deuce is Appleby always looking at his watch for ? I have it ! He has taken a cab by the hour . MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Oh , you malicious creature ! We can only hope his hour has come at last ! WALTON .  --  What fun , to plunge him into the extravagance of another hour of cab hire ! ( As Appleby just then approaches to say adieu , Walton slips his arm within Appleby 's confidingly . ) WALTON .  --  Appleby , did I ever tell you that adventure of mine in the Rockies last August ? ( Walton leads Appleby apart , extreme L. Appleby 's watch drops back into his pocket and with manifest effort he resigns himself . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( pleasantly ) .  --  I hope you have enjoyed your drive this afternoon , Miss Coddington ? ( Arabella , much alarmed , drops card-case , scattering cards . Appleby tries to pick them up ; their heads meet and bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jog , aside ) .  --  Speak up , you awkward thing ! Be lively , bright , be unstudied  --  artless as a fawn  --  a greenwood fawn ! ARABELLA ( with a desperate effort , aside ) .  --  How can I be like a fawn , mamma , when you glare at me like that . ( To Mrs. Effingham . ) Yes , Mrs. Effingham , not at all ; that is , very much , thanks . ( Aside . ) Oh , dear , I hate society . She told me to say anything that came into my head . Nothing comes into my head but that I 'd like to drown myself . Mamma 's elbow will jog me black and blue before she 's done . ( Aloud . ) Yes , Mrs. Effingham , if you please , we drove out in the park  --  Central Park  --  yes , that was the very park . Something came near happening as we passed the Museum  --  yes , the Museum . It was a sea-lion that had escaped and was running down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabella , much confused , drops cards again . Appleby again stoops , she stoops , their heads meet , Arabella finding all eyes upon her . ) ARABELLA .  --  I mean a gazelle , or perhaps a crazy man ; at all events , policemen took it to the station-house , and it kicked  --  oh ! how it kicked and swore  --  yes , swore dreadfully ! Oh !  --  WALTON ( taps his forehead , aside , to Appleby ) .  --  Light in the upper story , eh ? MRS . CODDINGTON ( hastily ) .  --  My daughter and I have just had the pleasure of visiting the Sybarites ' new clubhouse . What luxury ! What extravagance ! Think of men spending all that money on a place where women ca n't be with them ! I 'll vow it is a mystery how marriages are ever made nowadays . The Sybarites is a premium on celibacy . APPLEBY ( watch in hand , makes a fresh start . He crosses room ) .  --  T-t-t-hat reminds me  --  reminds me , Mrs. Effingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . EFFINGHAM ( glancing mischievously at Walton ) .  --  I protest against your desertion , Mr. Appleby ; not , at any rate , before I have had the pleasure of presenting you to my friends . Mrs. and Miss Coddington  --  Mr. Appleby . ( Appleby 's watch falls in pocket ; he resigns himself again . ) MRS . CODDINGTON ( aside ) .  --  Appleby , the millionaire ; the match of the season . What a delightful coincidence that he and Arabella should have bumped each other 's heads . That 's what I call purely providential . Arabella , child , do n't poke your chin out ; think of something clever to say upon the spot . Be sportive , and sparkling as the dew-drop on the rose , and mind what I say , miss : remember you 're on no account to let the conversation flag . ARABELLA ( aside ) .  --  I have n't the ghost of an idea ; I 'm cold to my very toes , she frightens me so . It 's like speaking a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you visited the Sybarites , Miss Coddington ,  --  that fountain-head of gossip ,  --  and brought away no news ? ARABELLA ( goaded by a glance and a nudge from Mrs. Coddington ) .  --  Yes , Mrs. Effingham , there was news of something dreadful . It was  --  yes , I believe it was a murder  --  no , a duel  --  ALL .  --  A duel at the Sybarites ! ARABELLA ( hurriedly ) .  --  A desperate duel of the worst kind between two  --  two adversaries . It was likely both would be killed at once , or one immediately after the other . Yes , both killed ! Really dead , you know . They had gone away from town to fight . Yes , away , quite away , from town . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( speaking languidly ) .  --  To Maryland , I suppose ; that classic ground . But pray tell us the names of the combatants , Miss Coddington . You pique our curiosity . ARABELLA ( holding down her head ) .  --  It was  --  Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they vowed to kill each other without the slightest intermission . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( still languidly ) .  --  But his adversary ? Do n't leave us in such painful expectation . ARABELLA ( hesitating , aside ) .  --  His adversary . Oh ! must he have an adversary ? Who shall I say ? ( Aloud . ) It was Mr. Rutledge , I think ;  --  yes , Arthur Rutledge , and I do n't know anything more about it , I 'm sure  --  not if you tease and tease me ever so much . ( She bursts into tears . ) MRS . CODDINGTON ( horrified ) .  --  Arabella ! But what is the matter with dear Mrs. Effingham ? ( Mrs. Effingham starts violently , utters a faint scream , half rises from her chair , sinks into it again and lets fall her cup ; cup breaks ; Grayson and Walton exchange glances of astonishment . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( aside ) .  --  Rutledge  --  Arthur ! Great Heaven ! Fighting ! Wounded perhaps  --  ( She rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EFFINGHAM.  --  Thomas ! THOMAS .  --  Yes , ma'am . MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  I rang for you . THOMAS .  --  Sure , an ' it 's meself that be 's answerin ' ye , ma'am . ( Mrs. Effingham goes to left of stage . Thomas follows her . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  I want you to go  --  to send  --  to call a cab , a messenger , immediately , to  --  ( Aside . ) Oh , no ; I dare not ! How hopelessly foolish of me even to dream of it ! ( She ponders . ) THOMAS ( puzzled ) .  --  It 's to call a cab , an ' to call a messenger , and pl'ase , ma'am , is the cab to go in the messenger and where 's he to go to when he gets there ? MRS . EFFINGHAM ( starting from reverie ) .  --  Pick up the bits of that cup , and bring hot water . ( Aside . ) My place is here , chained to the wheel , while he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Crosses back to tea-table . ) THOMAS ( carefully collecting fragments of cup ) .  --  And to think of the mistress herself turned butter-fingers ! Howly Mither o ' Moses , but is n't this a consolation to an innicent offinder ! ( Bell . Exit Thomas . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( aside ) .  --  And I let him go without the fond , foolish words that were ever trembling on my tongue , but that I dared not utter . THOMAS ( drawing portire ) .  --  Gineral Sabretache ! ( Exit Thomas . Sabretache enters swaggering . ) SABRETACHE.  --  My compliments to you , Mrs. Effingham ! Ladies , good morning ! MRS . MARABOUT.  --  Good-bye , Lilian , I really must be off . Six teas still on my list , and I 'm dying to drop in on Fanny Golightty to see how she takes the news of Rutledge 's affair . You know that everybody is saying she and Rutledge are engaged . Shall I tell her , dear , she has your sympathy ? Good-bye , dearest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dearest ! ( Aside . ) Horrid little cat !

Appleby is about to follow her , when Walton interrupts him by an introduction in dumb show to General Sabretache , who greets him with effusion , squeezes his hand until Appleby winces , and takes Appleby 's arm in his .

WALTON .  --  You are just in time , General , to shed the light of experience on our discussion . Duels and dueling ; testimony by an expert ; startling facts in evidence ; broadswords and blunderbusses , eh ! And champion shots  --  from a very long bow . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( with an effort ) .  --  Pray do , General Sabretache ; it will be so amusing . SABRETACHE ( fiercely ) .  --  Amusing !

At Chickamauga and at Gettysburg , at Sadowa and Sedan , at Plevna and Alexandria , the name of Sabretache may be found inscribed upon the highest roll of honor . And not in the tented field alone . Affairs of honor  --  pooh ! mere bagatelles ! I 've had ' em by the score  --  at Paris , at Hamburg , in Vienna , in New York . Once resolved upon the fall of my opponent , his doom is sealed .

Enter Thomas . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( walking to extreme left ) .  --  Thomas , I have an order for you . ( Aside . ) You will go immediately  --  send immediately  --  to the lodgings of Mr. Rutledge . Say that his  --  his maiden aunt is in town , and wishes to know whether there is news of him . ( Aloud . ) See to the fire .

SABRETACHE ( mysteriously ) .  --  Nothing , sir ? Too much  --  I dare not reveal all in the presence of lovely woman . ( Bows and waves his hand . Mrs. Coddington curtsies . ) MISS CODDINGTON ( aside ) .  --  Here , mamma , is a gentleman who does not let the conversation flag . MRS . CODDINGTON ( aside ) .  --  Take example by him , my dear . A most agreeable talker , and so exciting . SABRETACHE.  --  Latterly , I was at the theater . A man persisted in staring at me ; an oblique gaze . Striding toward him I demanded the meaning of that gaze . Some men with him were audacious enough to take his part . Idiots ! in ten minutes , instead of one affair upon my hands , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following suit ) .  --  Four ! WALTON ( aside ) .  --  Why in the world did n't he make it fourteen , while he was about it ? SABRETACHE ( swaggering up and down ) .  --  We met on the appointed day . In less than half an hour I had broken the arm of one antagonist , the thigh of another , the collarbone of number three . A-a-h ! MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  And the fourth , poor soul ! what became of him ? ARABELLA ( imitating ) .  --  Yes , what became of him ? SABRETACHE.  --  Just here occurred a most extraordinary circumstance . I had abandoned the pistol for the sword . Naturally there was no hope for my opponent , who , by the way , was the man who stared at me . But , with my usual generosity , I resolved to spare his life . MRS . CODDINGTON ( raising her hands ) .  --  How truly great of you ! ( Aside to Arabella . ) Speak up , Arabella . ( Arabella , aroused from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; their heads bump . Arabella rises in confusion , and looking about her , says to Appleby  --  " How truly great of you ! " ) SABRETACHE.  --  Was n't it ? I had resolved only to strike the sword from his hand . Observe what follows . My stroke was so neat that his sword , lifted high into the air , turned thrice and descended , piercing my ill-fated adversary thro ' the eye  --  of course , instantly killing him . A-a-ah ! MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  How superbly heroic ! Arabella thinks so too , do n't you , Arabella ? SABRETACHE.  --  So it was , madam . But the cream of the joke is that , when all was over , I discovered the fellow meant nothing at all by his oblique intensity  --  he squinted . THOMAS ( who has been loitering under pretense of brushing hearth , etc. , aside ) .  --  For the wurrld and all , like me chaney imidge . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( perceiving him , and crossing from jardinire ) .  --  What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I endure this anxiety one moment longer . ( Aloud . ) And pray , what do you mean by loitering here ? WALTON .  --  He was waiting for the death of the General 's fourth victim . ( Exit Thomas , with a grin . ) Positively , Sabretache , you inspire me to recall some of my own warlike experiences ; not that I have anything worth telling , after you . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( aside ) .  --  How persistently they hover round this subject . ( Aloud . ) Mr. Walton , of that you will permit your audience to be the judge . MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  Yes , do , Mr. Walton . ARABELLA ( aside , to her mother ) .  --  Here is somebody else who does n't want to talk , mamma . MRS . CODDINGTON ( aside ) .  --  Stupid ! of course he does . Wait a minute and see . WALTON ( with affected hesitation ) .  --  Well , well , since you insist upon it ; but my achievement is a feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the late war , when I commanded a company of cavalry in Virginia . I rode out before breakfast , with my orderly , saw smoke issuing from the chimney of a disused cabin , rode softly up , dismounted , peeped thro ' the chinks , saw a round dozen of desperate fellows ,  --  Mosby 's best men ,  --  armed to the teeth and sitting at breakfast with bowie-knives beside each plate , and muskets laid across their knees . Without a moment 's hesitation I uttered a terrific war-cry and placed myself at the threshold with extended sword . Believing themselves surrounded , the black horsemen dashed to the door . Single-handed I met them and after a long and bloody conflict , eleven of them bit the dust . SABRETACHE ( with an air of mortification ) .  --  Eleven ! WALTON ( calmly ) .  --  I was a trifle out of breath , and my arm had lost a little of its terrible dash , and so the twelfth  --  MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Ran away , I suppose . WALTON .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The twelfth cavalryman rallied ferociously and  --  ( imitating Sabretache )  --  killed me on the spot . ( He laughs . All laugh but Sabretache , who frowns blackly . ) SABRETACHE.  --  I do n't know what you call it , Mr. Walton , but this appears to me to be a very poor joke . WALTON .  --  Joke ! It was a serious matter to me , I assure you . I never dreamt of disputing your feat with your squinting adversary , General . I beg of you to show equal respect to my untimely death . SABRETACHE ( making his adieu to Mrs. Effingham ) .  --  Your servant , madam . You , Mr. Walton , shall hear from me anon  --  anon , sir ! A-a-ah ! ( Exit Sabretache . ) MRS . CODDINGTON ( alarmed ) .  --  Oh , Mr. Walton , how could you tempt that desperate character ! I tremble at the danger that may be in store for you . WALTON .  --  Never fear , madam . An encounter with the valiant Sabretache is a brevet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe in his affair . Hartshorn , it is said , is a crack shot . ( He watches the effect on Mrs. Effingham . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( hysterically ) .  --  Mr. Grayson , you are the most obliging of mortals ; if you would only go to the club and fetch us the very latest news of this affair of poor Mr. Rutledge ! We 're all so interested ! GRAYSON.  --  At your command , " I 'll put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes . " ( Exit Grayson . ) WALTON ( calling after him ) .  --  Take Appleby 's cab , Grayson , you 'll make better time . ( Bell . ) APPLEBY ( starts , looking anxiously at watch ) .  --  I would volunteer with p-p-pleasure , Mrs. Effingham , but that it is impossible f-f-for me to return . I shall really be obliged to s-s-s-say  --  THOMAS ( announcing ) .  --  Dr. Grantley ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Arthur 's uncle ! WALTON .  --  That long-winded old Grantley , who is forever talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to tell me all . Heaven give me strength to bear it . ( Enter Dr. Grantley . ) DR . GRANTLEY.  --  Good-day , madam , good-day ! Fine weather we are having ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Oh , Doctor , do n't dissemble ! Do n't try to hide it ! I have divined the object of your visit . DR . GRANTLEY.  --  The object of my visit ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Go away , please , and talk to some one else . Only say that you do n't despise my weakness . DR . GRANTLEY.  --  Despise your weakness ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  How could you , though , considering how dear the object is to both of us . DR . GRANTLEY.  --  Hum ! haw ! To both of us ? MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Go , leave me . Already curious eyes are turned upon us . ( Mrs. Coddington and Arabella draw near ; she introduces him to both . ) WALTON .  --  Appleby , I 'll make common cause with you . I 'll share your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club inside of the two hours . APPLEBY .  --  Two hours , at a dollar and a half an hour , is pretty deuced s-s-s-t  --  WALTON .  --  Steep . Excuse me , but I 've no time to spare . See , he is coming toward us . Cling to me , Appleby , or I am lost . DR . GRANTLEY.  --  Walton ! Appleby ! The very men I have been looking for , to talk about the tariff . ( Takes an arm of each and leads them down , R. ) I ca n't think how I managed to lose you at the club last night , Walton , just after I had promised to read you that little article of mine , prepared for the " Evening Post . " Appleby , too  --  a man of capital and one of our representative citizens ; you will be interested in my views of the important question . Come , now , there 's no time like the present , and while our good hostess is making herself agreeable to her other friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading points . I have my manuscript here in my pocket . No trouble ! No trouble , I assure you . I like to oblige my friends . ( Draws immensely thick paper from pocket , puts on spectacles , and , with hems and haws , reads . ) " The paramount purpose of a tariff should be to provide for the expenses of Government by taxes which so distribute themselves as to be not only indirect , but least burdensome upon the industries of the country . If special industries are fostered , the protection afforded should be incidental only "  --  incidental , you observe  --  WALTON .  --  Yes , incidental . Exactly . So I should have said . DR . GRANTLEY ( resumes ) .  --  " And the law-maker should never consider his duty performed when he enriches a few at the expense of all . " APPLEBY .  --  That 's j-j-just what you 're doing to us , doctor , do n't you see ? Why d-d-do n't you enrich ' em all ? DR . GRANTLEY.  --  There are moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , as you and Walton seem interested , I 'll go on . This paragraph , now , will take your fancy . Hum ! haw ! " The present tariff is an iniquity for which the circumstances of the present situation afford no justification whatever . In reforming it , the free list should be immediately enlarged by a long catalogue of raw materials . " ( During this Walton and Appleby steal away . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  He is taking out a paper . No doubt a telegram . Yes , dear Mrs. Coddington , of course , you may put me down . MRS . CODDINGTON ( subscription book in hand ) .  --  So kind of you , Mrs. Effingham . Fifty dollars , did you say ? What good news for my committee ! I 'll try for a subscription from that dear old Doctor Grantley . ( Dr. Grantley looks up from paper , sees sofa vacant , looks around disconcerted , encounters Mrs. Coddington . ) MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  I was about to call to your notice , doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GRANTLEY ( cuts her short ) .  --  I am sure you will be interested , Mrs. Coddington , in what I 'm reading here . Pray sit ye down , ma'am . Hum ! haw ! As I was saying , the Morrison tariff bill which introduced the proposed horizontal reduction  --  MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Horizontal ! That means poor Arthur was lying on the ground . DR . GRANTLEY.  --  Was stupidity itself ; was neither scientific nor practical . ( Recaptures Appleby and Walton . ) I appeal to you , Appleby ; to you , Walton . Was it either scientific or practical ? ( Brings them down to sit on either side of Mrs. Coddington . ) Hem ! haw ! While we have been wasting time  --  MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Wasting time ! I knew it ! DR . GRANTLEY.  --  In an idle discussion of its absurdity , the welfare of our country ( raising his voice )  --  its very life  --  is trembling in the balance ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  His life ! ( Sinks in chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes over to back of chair , Walton stands at table ; Appleby , R. ) DR . GRANTLEY.  --  The heat of the room , no doubt . ( Goes over , feels pulse . ) Oh ! it 's a trifle ; she 'll do very well . ( Goes back to table , re-seats Appleby and Walton , resumes reading . Bell rings . Enter Thomas ; goes back of Mrs. Effingham 's chair . ) THOMAS .  --  Please , ma'am , it 's Misther Rutledge . ( Enter Rutledge . Sensation . ) MRS . EFFINGHAM ( flies to him ) .  --  Arthur ! Not dead ; not wounded ! RUTLEDGE.  --  Neither , that I know of . But , if you would promise to keep this up , I might consent to any fate . MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Then you killed that poor , poor Captain Hartshorn ? RUTLEDGE.  --  I left him a moment since , yawning his head off at the club . He may be dead by now , for he was reading my Uncle Grantley 's pamphlet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't be doing a more admirable thing . MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Then what does it mean ? All of us are burning with curiosity to hear the true story of your duel . RUTLEDGE.  --  Duel ! What duel ? DR . GRANTLEY.  --  Nobody told me anything about a duel . ALL .  --  Yes , tell us about your duel ! APPLEBY .  --  Y-y-yes , t-t-t-tell us  --  RUTLEDGE.  --  Duel ! My good friends , you flatter me . I have n't the least idea , nor ever had , of fighting with anybody , thank you . Just now  --  ( glance at Mrs. E. )  --  a lamb might lead me at its own sweet will . ALL .  --  Then there has been no duel ? RUTLEDGE.  --  Certainly not . MRS . EFFINGHAM ( tenderly ) .  --  But , oh , had you known how we have suffered on your account . Have n't we , Mr. Walton ? WALTON .  --  Acutely . Especially Grayson , who has gone to collect your dying sentences . ( Enter Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabretache . ) SABRETACHE.  --  Ladies , your most obedient ! Grayson tells me the news of this duel has reached you . No doubt you are astonished I did not mention it . The fact is , I was pledged to secrecy . But for circumstances I need not mention , I was to have been Hartshorn 's second . ( Enter Thomas . ) THOMAS .  --  Misthress Marabout . ( Enter Mrs. Marabout . ) MRS . MARABOUT ( out of breath ) .  --  My dear Lilian , I 've just run in again to say the story of the duel was a hoax . Rutledge dined at Delmonico 's last night , lunched at the club at two , was in the bow-window at half-past , and is at this moment driving Fanny Golightly down the Avenue in his dog-cart . ( Bell . ) THOMAS ( announcing ) .  --  Misther Grayson ! GRAYSON.  --  My dear Mrs. Effingham , I 'm told , on the best authority , Dr. Grantley has just paid all of Rutledge 's debts , and that he and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUTLEDGE ( advances from behind Mrs. E. ) .  --  Thanks , thanks , very much , my friends . So kind of you to settle my affairs . Certainly I am to be married very soon , but not  --  ( takes Mrs. E. 's hand )  --  to Miss Golightly . ( All bow , and congratulate Mrs. E. and Rutledge . Sabretache , Grayson , and Mrs. Marabout retire up , disgusted . ) MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  Well , I declare , I wo n't get a wink of sleep to-night unless I find out how this story got about . Who started it ? ALL .  --  Who could have started it ? APPLEBY .  --  W-w-w-w-who c-c-c-could  --  MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Perhaps Miss Coddington can enlighten us . ARABELLA ( jumps violently. )  --  I ? MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  Oh ! Ah ! I remember . I shall expire ! MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Come , Miss Coddington , speak up . Who told you about the duel ? ARABELLA ( bursting into tears ) .  --  Nobody . I made it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you told me on no account to let the conversation flag . ( Sensation , surprise and laughter . ) MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  Oh , I am disgraced ! Wait till I get you home , miss . Dr. Grantley , may I offer you a seat in my carriage ? DR . GRANTLEY ( who is talking to Walton and Appleby ) .  --  No , thank you , ma'am ; I am very much engaged . MRS . CODDINGTON.  --  Perhaps you 'll stop to dine with us ? I 'm sure Mr. Coddington would be charmed to have a talk with you about the tariff . DR . GRANTLEY.  --  Ah , in that case , madam  --  ( Offers her his arm . ) And I say , Walton , I 'll meet you later at the club , and finish what I was saying . Oh , I 'll wait for you , never fear . ( They retire up . ) WALTON .  --  Come , Appleby , Grayson . Let us fall into line , and retreat from the field with drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Walton ) .  --  Going back to your buffaloes and Indians for consolation , I presume . WALTON .  --  Not when I can derive such entertainment from nature nearer home , Mrs. Marabout . ( Mrs. M. tosses head , turns head away . ) RUTLEDGE ( to Walton ) .  --  Stay for the wedding , wo n't you ? MRS . EFFINGHAM.  --  Stop , please . I hope nobody will go until I 've thanked our friends for their kind attendance on our Tea at Four o'Clock . Back matter Curtain .
