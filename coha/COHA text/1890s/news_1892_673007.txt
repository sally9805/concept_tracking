txt An interesting question has been presented to the Treasury Department in regard to the steamships City of New-York and City of Paris , the owners of which are preparing to have them documented as American vessels , in accordance with the provisions of a special act of Congress granting ' them that privilege under certain conditions . The steamship company is anxious to retain the present complement of officers of those vessels , most of whom . however , are of foreign nationality , and , in order to bring them within the law requiring vessels of the United States to be officered exclusively by citizens of the United States , steps were taken to secure their Speedy naturalization . This , however , is a very slow process . The officers in question have already taken out their ' first papers , but must serve out the full probationary period before they become full-fledged citizens . Leaving out the question of their financial ability to remain idle during that period , the company itself is unwilling to sacrifice them for untried men of American citizenship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Treasury Department for the retention of Capt . Watkins as master of the City of Paris during his probational period of naturalization . The Commissioner of Navigation , to whom the matter was referred , has replied that the law is obligatory as to the citizenship of masters of United States vessels , and that such citizenship in the case of an alien is not established until he shall have fulfilled all the requirements of the naturalization laws . Unless this decision is reversed , the steamship company will have to secure a new set of officers for the two steamships , or else delay the doommenting of the vessels under United States laws until the present officers can legally serve .
