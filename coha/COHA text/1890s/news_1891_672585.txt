txt Probably no order of a court was ever before brought into a state of such unstable equilibrium as the . injunction in the Long Island Water Supply grab case has been left in by the singular action of Judge DYKMAN . An injunction had been granted by one Judge to restrain the city authorities from effecting a wasteful , and possibly fraudulent , purchase which they had agreed to make . The injunction , after a hearing , was continued by another Judge . But now Judge ItYloiAN decrees that the injunction " is hereby dissolved unless the plaintiff stipulates , within six days after the service upon his attorney of a copy of this order , to try the case on Feb. 16 . " This puts the fate of the injunction wholly into the hands of Mr. GAYNOR , attorney for the complainant . Mr. GAYNOR refuses to accept service of Judge DYKMAN 'S order , and the clerk slams it down upon his desk , which is doubtless a legal service . But Mr. GAYNOR declines in any manner to recognize Judge DYKMAN in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will try the case at the March term and not before . If well stuck to , this resolution will operate to dissolve a valuable and useful injunction on Tuesday , Feb. 17 , and that will probably be the first instances of its kind on record . Judge DYKMAN 'S extraordinary course is variously criticised . Some men of prominence at the bar call it startling , others say it is outrageous ; nobody has the hardihood to defend it . When the ring Judges in TWEED 'S time issued orders permitting the looting of this city , the looters made all haste to avail themselves of their opportunities . Mayor C HA PIN , fortunately , is nut of that disposition . It is announced that , notwithstanding Judge DYK MAN 'S order , tile purchase will not be completed until the case is tried , and that is the only reassuring feature of the situation .
