txt A great many letters have been received at the Treasury Department recently making inquiries concerning the coinage of silver dollars and the redemption and cancellation of Treasury notes , and in order to avoid the labor of retailing the information in answers to each letter Secretary Carlisle to-day dictated the following memorandum on the subject , which he gave to the United Press for publication : The first section of the act of July 14. 1890 , known as the Sherman act , provides that the Secretary of the Treasury should purchase from time to time bullion to the aggregate amount of 4.500,000 ounces , or so much thereof as might , be offered in each month at the market price , not exceeding $1 for 371.25 grains of pure silver , and should issue in payment for such purchases Treasury notes of the United States ; in such form and of such denominations not less than $1 or more than $1,000 as he might prescribe . The second section of that act provides that the notes so issued shall be redeemable on demand in coin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any Assistant Treasury , or , when so redeemed , may be reissued ; but no greater or less amounts of such notes shall be outstanding at any time than the cost of the silver bullion and the standard dollars coined therefrom then held in the Treasury or purchased by such notes . The second section further provides that upon demand of the holder of any of the notes therein provided for the Secretary of the Treasury shall , under such regulations as he may prescribe , redeem such notes in gold or silver coin at his discretion , it being the established policy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be prescribed by law . The third section provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall coin each month 2.000 , - 000 ounces of the silver bullion purchased under the provisions of the law into standard silver dollars until the 1st day of July , 1891 , and after that time he shall coin of the silver bullion so purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption of the Treasury notes therein provided for , and " any gain or seismforage arising from such coinage shall be accounted for and paid ' into the Treasury . " It will be seen from the foregoing that , while the law provides that redeemed Treasury notes may be reissued , it also in the same section imposes an express limitation upon the power to reissue by declaring that " no greater or less amount of such notes shall be outstanding at any time than the cost of the silver bullion and the standard sliver dollars coined therefrom then held in the Treasury purchased by such notes . " When such notes are redeemed in gold ; ' there is no obstacle in the way of their reissue , because redemption does not affect the stock of silver held in the Treasury under the act of July 14 , 1890 . When they are redeemed by silver coined from the bullion purchased under that act , they must be retired and canceled , for otherwise there would be , after the redemption and reissue , a greater amount of notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then held in the TreamarY , and this is expressly prohibited ? by the statute . The purpose of Congress was to prevent the duplication of currency , which would ' be the case if the notes and the silver purchased with the notes could be outstanding at the same , time . Treasury notes received in the , ordinary course of business , or redeemed in gold or exchanged for silver dollars not coined from the bullion purchased under the act of July 14 , 1890 , are not retired and canceled . All such notes are reissued . Prior to the 1st day of July , 1891 , standard silver dollars ' to the amount of $36,318,264 were coined from the bullion purchased under that act . The so-called gain or seigniorage arising from this coinage was $6,837,803 , which was paid into the Treasury as a miscellaneous receipt , leaving $29,480,461 to be held as a fund to provide for the redemption of the Treasury notes , as provided by law . At the beginning of the present 4dministration this sum of $29,480,461 was still in the TreasurY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been coined ' since that time . Of this last sum , however , $520,079 was seigniorage , leaving $1,077,144 to be held in the Treasury . It appears , therefore , that the whole coinage under the act has been $37,905,487 , and that the amount to be held in the Treasury for redemption purposes was $30,557 , , ) 05 . Of this sum , $4,121,000 has been used in the redemption of the notes , and that amount has been retired and canceled . No Treasury note has been redeemed in silver unless silver was demanded , the policy and practice of the department having always been to redeem in the kind of money demanded by the holder of a note . The presentation of Treasury notes for redemption in silver began in August , 1 1873 , when there was a great scarcity of currency of small denominations , and there was redeemed during that month $1,273,287 , which is the largest amount that has been presented during any one month . As shown above , there were held in the Treasury at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullion purchased under the act of July 14 1890 . Notwithstanding the fact that $1.597,223 has been coined since that time , there is now on hand only $26,189,724.
