txt THE origin of the Conference is well known . Proposed by the Czar of Russia , and summoned , at his instance , by the Queen of the Netherlands , the Conference met in the city of The Hague , on the 18th of May of the current year , and rcmained in session until it adjourned sine die on the 29th of July . It was attended by delegates from twenty-six Powers . Of these , twenty were European , two American and four Asiatic . It is interesting to compare this with the membership of the International Marine Conference , the first world Conference ever held for purposes of quasi legislation , which met in Washington at the call of the United States Government in 1889 . At that Conference , twentyeight Powers were represented , fourteen European , eleven American ( including Hawaii ) , and three Asiatic At the Conference of Peace , the European Powers were Germany , Austria , Bclgium , Denmark , Spain , France , Great Britain and Ireland , Greece , Italy , Luxembourg , Montenegro , Iolland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Norway , Switzerland , Turkey , and Bulgaria . The American Powers were the United States of America , and Mexico . The Asiatic Powers were China , Japan , Persia and Siam . Each Power had one vote , but was represented by as many delegates as it chose . * The writer , having been a member of the Commission representing the United States at the International Conference at The Hague , has endeavored to state accurately not only the action of the Conference , but also the attitude of the American dclegation . He has done this , however , in his own words , and from his own point of view ; so that he alone , and not any of his colleagues , is responsible for the statements contained in thl* paper . The purpose of the paper is to give to the ordinary reader , as *istlnguished from the student , a general idea of the Conference and it , work . The student should turn to the official reports of the American Commission , which alone can speak with authority on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the membership of the Conference is that , like its predecessor the International Marine Conference , it included nations from America and Asia , as well as from Europe ; and the second is that the representation of Europe and of Asia was much more complete than that of America . It is striking that the entire Continint of Africa , once the seat of power of the Pharaohs and of Carthage , contains to-day no nation that was invited . It is not known to the writer why the nations of Central and South America were not represented . The notable sub-division of Europe into separate and independent Powers , as compared with the other continents represented , is strikingly evident from the composition of the Conference . When one recalls that a similar list of the European Powers made a century ago would have shown a still greater sub-division , one can not help wondering whether the process of amalgamation is yet complete . On the one side is the astonishing persistence of national types , even when limited to small areas , affecting language , customs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the other side , are all the tendencies of the age , as illustrated , as forcibly as anywhere , in the industrial and commercial world . The practical inconveniences arising from custom-houses at short intervals , from changing currencies during every long journey , and from change of language , are also exceedingly great in an age when travel and commercial intercourse are easy and are bringing about the unification of the world in so many ways . This is an interesting problem suggested by the Conference of Peace , though not discussed by it . The unique character of the Conference appeared in other ways . While French was the language of the Conference , one could hear among the delegates almost every civilized tongue . Reports were transmitted to the home governments in the perpendicular writing of the Orient , and in the right to left writing of the Middle East , as well as in the characteristic script of European speech . At the reception given to the Conference by the Queen , which every one attended in gala costume , the spectacle was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform and orders of their rank . It led one of the delegates to remark that there had been no such gathering of the nations since the Congress of Vienna early in the century . But , indeed , except at Washington in 1889 , there has been at no time any such // meeting ; for the presence of Asia and America in conference with Europe is a thing still new in the world 's history . China , true to its conservative instincts , wore here as everywhere its characteristic dress . Japan and Siam , on the other hand , wore the dress of Europe , as if to emphasize their formal entry among the world 's family of nations . The Turk with his red fez and the Persian with his black , while otherwise dressed as Europeans , seemed to illustrate how hard it is for the East wholly to assimilate itself to the West . The Americans in their evening dress were happily conspicuous for their simplicity . But , whatever the variety , there , as in everything relating to the Conference , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's Powers on the basis of equality , each having one vote , and on the basis of recognized independence . It will be observed , also , that among the nations represented there were all the great Powers of the world and many of the small ones ; Powers that control great areas of the world 's surface and influence great multitudes of the world 's people , and Powers content to preserve and guard their own individuality in the small domains that are theirs ; Powers also that are aggressive factors in the world 's life , and Powers that find the forces of modern civilization in conflict with all that has been characteristic of their national history . Under these circumstances , it might well have been imagined tnat some line of cleavage would show itself among the Powers in relation to the various questions to come before the Conference . Nothing of the sort occurred . Only at two points was there the slightest suggestion of differences between classes of Powers , as to questions of interest or point of view . When the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Balkan States showed great sensitiveness as to certain features of the plan , lest these should enable their powerful neighbors to interfere with their autonomy . These features were immediately modified or explained in such a way as to meet the views of the Balkan States . Again , on the question of forbidding the use of asphyxiating shells and of bullets that expand or flatten easily on entering the human body , the record reads as if it were the Anglo-Saxon against the world , for England and the United States were the only two Powers who voted against this prohibition . // It is worth while to go at some length into this subject , in order that the attitude of the American Delegation may be perfectly understood . Before doing so , however , it may tend to clearness to summarize the completed action of the Conference , as embodied in its final act . This document sets forth that the Conference has prepared , for submission to the Plenipotentiaries of the Powers , ( 1 ) three Conventions , ( 2 ) three Declarations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that " the limitation of the military charges which at present so oppress the world is greatly to be desired , for the increase of the material and moral welfare of mankind " ; and that it has passed six other resolutions , with differing degrees of unanimity , referring various questions for other and later consideration . The questions referred for other consideration need only be briefly stated . The Conference expressed the hope that the Swiss Government would call an early meeting of a special Conference , to revise the Geneva Convention in relation to the Red Cross ; that the Governments would make a special study of questions relating to muskets and marine artillery , with a view of reaching an understanding as to the adoption of new types and calibres ; also , that the Governments would consider the possibility of reaching an understanding concerning the limitation of armed forces on land and sea , and of war budgets ; and that some future Conference should consider all questions relating to the rights and duties of neutral States , the question of the immunity of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of the bombardment of ports , cities , and villages by a naval force . The three Conventions embody the constructive work of the Conference . It suits best the scheme of this paper , however , to discuss first the three Declarations , for it was upon two of these that America and England were arrayed against the world . The three Declarations were as follows : 1 . A Declaration prohibiting the throwing of projectiles and explosives from balloons or by other new analogous means , such prohibition to be effective for five years . 2 . A Declaration prohibiting the use of projectiles having as their sole object the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases . 3 . A Declaration prohibiting the use of bullets which expand or flatten easily in the human body , as illustrated by certain given details of construction . // The action of the Conference in relation to asphyxiating shells is embodied in the Declaration which forbids " the use of projectiles having as their sole object the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases . " In other words , if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is not intended to burst but only to asphyxiate , it is forbidden . It may be remarked that no such shells exist as those which are thus forbidden . What may be the effect of such shells , therefore , if any such are ever made , is purely hypothetical . To forbid their use under such circumstances seems like paraphrasing Lord Dundreary 's famous question , " If you had a brother , would he like cheese ? " Neither is it clear why shells which asphyxiate only should be forbidden , while shells which both explode and asphyxiate should be permitted . The second question , as to bullets which expand or flatten easily in the human body , is more technical , but the objection to the action taken by the Conference can be made not less clear . The exact text of the Declaration adopted by the Conference reads as follows : " The contracting Powers forbid the use of bullets which expand or flatten easily in the human body , such as jacketed bullets of which the jacket does not entirely cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Delegation was at one with the representatives of the other Powers in willingness to forbid unnecessarily cruel bullets , and , in order to show this , the Delegation twice offered , once in Committee and once in the full Conference , a carefully drawn resolution forbidding all bullets of an unnecessarily cruel character . It is one of the curiosities of the parliamentary procedure in use at the Conference that , on neither occasion , could this resolution be brought to a vote . In Committee , the Chairman merely swept it aside , as being too vague ; and , in the Conference , in order to avoid a hopeless tangle as to the status of the question as between the Declaration recommended by the committee and the resolution proposed on behalf of the United States , the Conference itself voted to give precedence to the Declaration coming from the committee , and , this being adopted , the Conference left the American resolution in the air . In other words , the United States wished to declare a principle ; the Conference preferred to forbid a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie precisely in its details . It was forcibly // maintained by the United States ordnance expert , Capt . William Crozier , of the American Delegation , that it is quite conceivable that a ball should be invented for a smaller-calibre musket than any now in use , which , by expanding evenly , would be as effective as bullets of larger size without being in any way more cruel . It was also pointed out that inventors , in trying to avoid the details of construction prohibited by the Declaration , might easily be driven to the invention of bullets much more cruel as to the character of wounds that they would make , but which would yet be permissible because the Declaration hinges on details and not upon a principle . Incidentally , it came out in the discussion that the Declaration was aimed at a certain kind of bullet actually in use in the army of one of the Powers represented at the Conference . With this aspect of the question the Delegation from the United States naturally had no concern ; but it showed its willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the condemnation of this or any other bullet that might be shown to be unnecessarily cruel . In view of the attitude of the United States Delegation towards these two proposals arbitrarily to limit the progress of invention in relation to weapons of war , it may be asked why , on the other hand , the Delegation joined in the Declaration of the Conference prohibiting " for five years , the throwing of projectiles and explosives from balloons or by other new analogous means . " This Declaration , it will be observed , differs from the others materially in being limited to the term of five years . But , apart from that , there is a reason why , for the time being , this prohibition rests upon a recognizable principle . Up to the present moment , balloons are uncontrollable ; they are the sport of the winds . Projectiles thrown from them , therefore , are as likely to injure noncombatants as combatants . They may also do merely useless damage ; that is to say , damage that does not advance at all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Delegation was glad to join in the Declaration of the Conference upon this subject , limited as it is to five years . From these statements , it will be clear that the Delegation from the United States was not less willing than others to forbid useless cruelty in war . Perhaps it is also evident that the Delegation was not ready to encourage any mere limitations on invention in relation to warfare . This attitude is strictly in accord , not only with // the spirit of the instructions received by the Delegation , but also with the historic attitude of the United States . Wars are much less frequent in these days than they used to be ; they are also much shorter in duration . Although more destructive while they last , it can not be questioned that , by reason of their infrequency and their shorter duration , the sum of human misery which war inflicts is much less great in recent than in earlier times . As the engines of war increase in destructiveness , they usually become more costly ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive to use . The fearful costliness of modern war is one very great restraint upon a resort to it . This is , probably , one of the reasons why , in America , it has never been thought wise to try to prevent the free application of invention to the improvement of the weapons and engines of war . The famous circular of the Russian Government proposing the Conference emphasized especially the need of the nations for disarmament . Because nothing definite was done in this direction , there is an impression in many quarters that the Conference accomplished very little . If the Conference had been originally called to promote arbitration , the opinion would probably be general that it had accomplished a great deal . The detailed proposals submitted by the Russians under the head of disarmament were so incomplete that the subject , in all its details , was referred , almost without debate , to the further study of the Powers . On the other hand , the Conference adopted unanimously the following resolution : " The Conference believes that the limitation of the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be desired for the increase of the material and moral welfare of mankind . " Undoubtedly , this is only an opinion and it has no binding force ; but , clearly , it strengthens the hands of all who object to an increase of military burdens where they press heavily , and it places upon the Governments the necessity of justifying , not only to their own people but also to the public opinion of mankind , every increase in armaments . It may properly be said that , apart from every other aspect of the question , the Conference was not well composed for action in this regard . The Powers of America and Asia were called upon to consider , so far as this question is concerned , what is , in many of its aspects , a purely European question . Nowhere else in the world is the whole male population trained to arms ; and nowhere // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . else does militarism withdraw from the ranks of productive industry vast numbers of men , while at the same time making their support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make clear its own conception of the situation , at the proper time placed on the records of the Conference the following declaration : " The Delegation of the United States of America have concurred 1* the conclusions upon the first clause of the Russian letter of December 30th , 1898 , presented to the Conference by the First Commission , namely : that the proposals of the Russian representatives , for fixing the amounts of effective forces and of budgets , military and naval , for periods of five and three years , can not now be accepted , and that a more profound study upon the part of each State concerned is to be desired . But , while thus supporting what seemed to be the only practicable solution of a question submitted to the Conference by the Russian letter , the Delegation wishes to place upon the record that the United States , in so doing , does not express any opinion as to th' course to be taken by the States of Europe . This declaration is not meant to indicate mere indifference to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States immediately , but expresses a determination to refrain from enunciating opinions upon matters into which , as concerning Europe alone , the United States has no claim to enter . The words drawn up by M. Bourgeois , and adopted by the First Commission , * received also the hearty concurrence of this Delegation , because in so doing it expresses the cordial interest and sympathy with which the United States , while carefully abstaining from anything that might resemble interference , regards all movements that are thought to tend to the welfare of Europe . The military and naval armaments of the United States are at present so small , relatively to the extent of territory and to the number of the population , as well as in comparison with those of other nations , that their size can entail no additional burden of expense upon the latter , nor can even form a subject for profitable mutual discussion . " The Conventions prepared by the Conference are entitled : ( 1 . ) A Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes ; ( 2 . ) A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( 3 . ) A Convention for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Conference of August 22 , 11864 . It will be convenient to deal with the first Convention last . The Convention concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land is a development of the laws and customs of war proposed by the Brussels Conference of 1874 , as those proposed rcgulations in turn , though perhaps less consciously , were a development of the * The resolution already quoted in regard to disarmament . // laws of war formulated at the request of President Lincoln , during the American Civil War , by Prof. Francis Lieber of Columbia University in the City of New York . The general tendency of the rules embodied in this Convention is to lessen the suffering of individuals at the hands of armies , in time of war , and to place some limitations upon the action of invading armies . The United States Delegation left this Convention unsigned , in order that it may be carefully examined by the proper authorities , inasmuch as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the Delegation heartily recommends its acceptance . The Convention for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention of August 22 , 1864 , consists , in substance , of ten articles . So far as these articles relate to hospital ships carrying the flag of a belligerent , they mark an unquestionable advance in the direction of more humane conduct of naval war . Unfortunately , in providing for the use of hospital ships under neutral flags , and in referring to the picking up of men in the water by other vessels under neutral flags , the articles do not , in the opinion of the American Delegation , sufficiently determine the status of the men who may thus be rescued . Capt . Mahan proposed three additional articles to cover these points beyond a peradventure ; but , when it became apparent that these additional articles could not be adopted , but would only lead to discussions that might imperil the ten articles already agreed to , Capt . Mahan , with the approval of the American Delegation , withdrew his proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference with reference to the articles of the Convention as it now stands . At the same time , the American representatives did not sign this Convention , but referred it to their Government , without recommendation . The precise question to be determined is , whether the gain resident in the articles as they stand offsets the disadvantage of introducing new and doubtful questions with reference to neutral vessels near the scene of a naval battle . The Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes is , undoubtedly , the most important work of the Conference . As the name implies , it is much more than a scheme for arbitration , though arbitration is a vital part of it . The Convention consists of four Titles : Title 1 . Concerning the Maintenance of the General Peace . // Title 2 . Concerning Good Offices and Mediation . Title 3 . Concerning International Commissions of Inquiry . Title 4 . Concerning International Arbitration . Title 4 is sub-divided into Chapters , as follows : Chapter 1 relates to the general subject of Arbitration , defines its object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Arbitration , and provides for its establishment . Chapter 3 relates to procedure in cases of arbitration , especially before the Permanent Court . Title I of the Convention consists of only one article , but it explains the purpose of the whole Convention . This article reads as follows : " With the view of preventing , as often as possible , the resort to force between nations , the signatory Powers agree to employ all their efforts to assure the peaceful settlement of international differences . " By Title 2 , the signatory Powers engage , in case of grave differences of opinion or of dispute , to have recourse , whenever circumstances permit , to Good Offices or Mediation . The Powers drifting towards war may themselves ask for such good offices from a friendly Power ; or , neutral Powers may , at their discretion , tender such good offices . Such tender may be made even after a conflict has broken out , and in no case is it to be considered otherwise than as a friendly act . Each Power involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , both as regards the acceptance of good offices and as regards the result in the event of acceptance . A special form of mediation proposed by Mr. ilolls , Secretary of the American Commission , was accepted unanimously by the Conference . It contemplates the appointment of a friendly nation to act as mediator by each ene of the Powers involved in the dispute . These seconds , so to speak , are to endeavor together to find some basis of settlement which will avoid war , and failing in that , they remain charged with the duty of restoring peace at as early a day as possible . By Title 3 , the signatory Powers say , only , that " they judge it useful , " in controversies of an international order , engaging neither honor nor essential interests , and involving a difference of opinion on questions of fact as to which the parties concerned have not been able to come into accord by the ordinary diplomatic methods , that these Powers should establish , whenever circum // stances will permit , an International Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty by throwing light upon the questions of fact , by means of an impartial and conscientious examination . The Powers . concerned retain the right to give what force they please to the reports of such Commissions . The propriety of such a provision , where the nations concerned are left free , can hardly be questioned . In the Venezuela Boundary dispute , the United States Government instituted an inquiry of its own as to a controversy between two other nations . It thus recognized the necessity , at times , for outside inquiry as to questions directly affecting other nations . In the case of the destruction of the " Maine , " an international inquiry was proposed by Spain and declined by the United States . The latter instance shows that the proposed Convention adopted by the Conference of Peace simply regulates and defines the scope and significance of action already recognized in diplomacy . Every nation is left free to iiccept or decline such an inquiry , and also to accept or decline to accept the findings resulting from the inquiry . By placing Title 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention at once gives to arbitration a place among the recognized means of preserving the peace of the world . It is hoped , and it is expected , that it will more and more serve this high function . For this reason , among others , the resort to Arbitration , like the resort to Good Offices and Mediation and to International Commissions of Inquiry , is left wholly voluntary . This , in the judgment of the writer , is the strength and not the weakness of the plan . Obligatory arbitration , stretched to its utmost limit as a general obligation , could only cover unimportant matters . Such questions will always be settled , without any such obligation , either in the usual diplomatic way or by arbitration . But arbitration that is voluntary may , by mutual consent , be applied to the whole field of international controversy . It has already settled many grave and threateniPg international disputes , and in the future , it will doubtless settle many more . The question may be asked , if this is so , in what way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer would reply , ( 1 ) by giving to arbitration this recognized place among the means of preserving the world 's peace ; ( 2 ) by making notable provision for it through the establishment of a Permanent Court ; and ( 3 ) by making a resort to arbitration easy . // At one point in the Convention there is a seeming departure from the voluntary character of the methods proposed for preserving the world 's peace . Article 27 of this Convention reads : " The signatory Powers cor*sidcr it a duty , in the case when an acute dispute threatens to break out between two or more of them , to remind these Powers that the Permanent Court is open to them . Consequently , they declare that the fact of calling the attention of the Parties to the provisions of the present Convention , and the advice given , in the higher interest of peace , to address themselves to the Permanent Court , can not be considered otherwise than as acts of Good Offices . " When this section was literally read , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposal to enter into an obligation to intervene , in the manner proposed , in every controversy that might arise between any of the signatory Powers ; and to invite a similar course on their part towards the United States . Such an obligation and such an invitation , without any modification , might well be thought , as it appeared to the Delegation , to be in direct conflict with the historic policy of the United States in both directions . The American Delegation endeavored , therefore , to secure an amendment of Article 27 which would limit the duty accepted by the signatory Powers to the cases where circumstances would permit , thus making it clear , upon the face of the Article , that each nation was to judge for itself when the duty could properly be discharged . At an earlier stage of the Conference , such an amendment could probably have been made ; for there was no hesitation , on the part of any one , in saying that the obligation created by the article was a moral duty , as to the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be its own judge . On the other hand , it was pointed out that , at the end of the Conference , an attempt to amend the terms of the Article as agreed upon in Committee might lead to very serious results . Accordingly , the American Delegation contented itself by placing on the minutes of the Conference , when the Convention was about to be adopted , the following Declaration : " The Delegation of the United States of America , in signing the Convention regulating the peaceable settlement of international conflicts , as proposed by the International Peace Conference , make the following declaration : Nothing contained in this Convention shall be so construed as to require the United States of America to depart // from its traditional policy of not intruding upon , interfering with , or entangling itself in , the political questions or policy or internal administration of any foreign State ; nor shall anything contained in the said Convention be construed to imply a relinquishment by the United States of America of its traditional attitude toward purely American questions . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention was immediately adopted by the Conference without dissent . The Convention was subsequently signed by the American Delegation subject to the reserve of this Declaration . The foregoing explanation will have made it clear that the Convention to which this Declaration applies is much more than a convention providing for a Permanent Court of Arbitration . The Convention can not fail to be useful in promoting the peaceful settlement of international disputes , wherever such a settlement is possible ; but , on the other hand , it appeared to be essential that the United States , in becoming a party to the Convention , should not , by the very act , appear to abandon policies that have become part of the nation 's life . No such embarrassment confronted any other Power . It is not proposed , in this article , to discuss the details of the Permanent Court of Arbitration . Briefly , each of the signatory Powers files in a Bureau at The Hague a list of not more than four names of men decmed by it to be well equipped to s*rve as arbitrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signatory Powers accredited to The Hague , with the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs as Chairman . This Administrative Council conducts the central Bureau , appoints the Clerk of the Court , provides offices , and , in a word , attends to all the details . When an arbitration is desired , the Powers concerned agree upon its terms and indicate their arbitrators . While nations desiring to arbitrate are not confined in their choice to men whose names are upon the list , it is expected that the choice of arbitrators will ordinarily be made from this number . Indeed , the provision of these names is one of the ways in which arbitration has been made easy , as it is hoped by this means to avoid one of the difficulties , always felt in arranging for arbitrations hitherto ; that is to say , the difficulty of finding suitable arbitrators . Up to this time it has been necessary , with great effort and delay , to construct every detail of the tribunal that is called into being to conduct such an arbitration . The Conference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , of such a tribunal . It still remains necessary for the Powers concerned to agree upon the terms of the arbitration and upon the arbitrators ; but , all that it is now necessary to do is to put together the parts of the machine that are , as it were , already assembled , instead of , as heretofore , being obliged to construct the parts as well as to put them together . The permanency of the Court and of the records is also a factor of the greatest importance ; for permanency of court and of record takes for granted the gradual growth of a system of international jurisprudence , and such a system necessarily involves and must rest upon the idea of international justice . When these considerations are fully appreciated , it will be evident that the International Conference of Peace has justified its being . The broad significance of the Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes may be stated in a single word . The Powers that give their adhesion to this Convention , when drifting toward war , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the responsibility of declining to accept good offices , of declining to accept mediation , of declining to accept an international inquiry , and of declining to accept arbitration . This Convention proceeds upon the theory that a nation ought to be willing to accept these responsibilities , before resorting to arms , precisely as President McKinley , when the Spanish-American War was coming on , declined to accept an international inquiry in regard to the destruction of the " Maine , " and told the representatives of the Powers , when they waited upon him , that a situation had grown up which was no longer tolerable to the American people . No one supposes that this Convention , even if universally signed , will prevent all war ; but it will compel the nations , in a new way , to justify war to the public opinion of mankind . All that a body of the nature of the Conference could do , has been done . It remains for other forces , and notably for public opinion in all the nations , to make effective what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no greater evidence of the wisdom of the Conference than that it has , thv* fearlessly and confidently , left to public opinion the vitalization of its work . It is a happy augury that , before the Conference adjourned , the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes was signed by the Plenipotentiaries of sixteen out of twenty-six of the Powers represented at the Conference , namely // by Belgium , Denmark , Spain , The United States of America , Mexico , France , Greece , Montenegro , Holland , Persia , Portugal , Roumania , Russia , Siam , Sweden and Norway , and Bulgaria . There seemed to be no reason to doubt , at the time of adjournment , that the other Powers would sign before the 31st of December . The question of ratification remains to be determined in every case , and it is impossible to predict by what date action on that point may be looked for in any of the nations . The public opinion of the United States may well address itself to securing the ratification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President.
