The persons implicated belong to the group of the Royalist youth , and the Patriotic and Anti-Semitic Leagues . " At the trial of the Neuilly Barrack affair facts relating to that incident alone were used as the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents were seized which led to the discovery of an organization , dating back to July , 1895 , and of a plot to seize the Government by force . The documents leave no room for doubt , either in regard to the existence of the plot or as to the chief actors therein . " After very close watch , organized proof was obtained that the same groups were preparing for a fresh attempt at an early date , the proof being such as to enable the disturbances to be averted by immediate measures . The investigation of the affair is intrusted to M. Fabre , Examining Magistrate . " On the application of M.

Deroulede was pending , traces were discovered of a fresh plot , and of consultations at which the question was discussed whether the attempt should be made to change the form of government before or after the Hennes court-martial . The Government , thereupon , judging that the time for action had arrived , ordered a number of arrests to be made , all of which , apparently , have not yet been effected . The Ministry of the Interior declines to give the names of the prominent persons already captured , or who are to be taken into custody . When arrested . M. Deroulede shouted : " It is a rascality on the part of the Government , which is trying to implicate me in the same affair as the Orleanists , whose adversary I am .
