txt The vigorous presentment of the Grand Jury of this county , condemning in scathing terms the disgracefill and unsafe condition of the building in which the most valuable records of the county are kept , calls to mind once more the deplorable delay and wretched bungling that have attended the effort to provide a proper structure for that purpose . It was eight years ago that a commission was created to provide such a building , and at almost every session of the Legislature since , some modification has been made of the original act , or some new provision has been enacted or old one repealed , with a view to facilitating the undertaking . The need has increased froni year to year , and everything is yet to do , and still another bill on the subject is at this moment pending in both houses at Albany . The original act provided for a building which should accommodate the offices and records of the Register , County Clerk , and Surrogate , and which should be in the neighborhood of the Court House , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a municipal building for those and other purposes , at one time permitting it to be located in the park and at another time excluding it . Once the old City Hall was to be removed and a new one built . As the law now stands , there is ample authority for constructing the required building , but it can not be located in the park , and the old difficulty of finding a proper site elsewhere , which seemed to be insuperable , stands in the way . The bill which has been introduced at the present session is more definite and specific than most of those previously passed . It ignores the commission created in 1888 and puts the power in the hands of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . It requires the building to be in the City Hall Park , " at or near the corner of Chambers and Centre Streets , " and authorizes the removal of all the old buildings on the eastern side of the park . It declares that it shall be for the use of the offices of Surrogate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city Departments of Finance , Law , and Taxes and Assessments , which are now in rented premises . Provision is made for obtaining plans , letting contracts , , &c.; Whether-this is ; the ' , best , , raethod ' : of
