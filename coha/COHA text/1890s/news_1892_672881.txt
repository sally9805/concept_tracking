txt In the death of J S. MOORE the cause of tariff reform loses an accomplished advocate and Tax TIMES a valued contributor . Mr. MOORE possessed an unequaled knowledge of the history of tariff legislation in the United States and of the practical bearing of our customs laws upon the trade and industries of the country . His experience as a merchant in England , in India , in South Africa , in Australia , and in the United States , and his years of service in the New-York Custom House , gave him extraordinary opportunities , of which he made the best use to obi tain a technical and practical familiarity with the theory and working of tariffs such as no other man of his time has possessed . His knowledge was freely employed in the service of Ways and Means Committees charged with the preparation of projects of revision , and until failing health checked his activity his pen was busy in argument and exposition upon the side of revenue reform and lower taxes . He was a stout and efficient combatant because perfectly equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proverbial ; and he had a kindly way of helping to their feet his co-workers whenever they tripped in the intricate paths of tariff discussion . Mr. MOORE 'S mind was open to the charm of whatever is fine and estimable in life . His conversation bespoke a high and varied cultivation . He knew his Talmud as he did his Goethe and his Shakespeare , and was versed as few men are in Oriental learning . Good music or a good play delighted him , and he was conspicuously fitted for the pleasures of good fellowship , in equal measure giving and enjoying . For almost a quarter of a century Mr. MOORE has been a contributor of signed letters to THE TIMES , mostly upon tariff subjects . In that domain he had no equal , and Tax TimEs and its readers must be reckoned among the great number of friends and admirers who mourn his too early death .
