txt We are at a loss to understand the-unwillingness of such Republicans as Senator Sherman and Mr. Reed to vote for a bond issue specifically payable in gold , so long as they are willing , as both of them are , to vote for bonds payable in coin . Both of these gentlemen would declare with emphasis that the " coin " bonds now outstanding authorized by the acts of 1875 and 1870 are payable in gold , if the holder wished gold at the time of payment . If asked to defend this declaration  --  which is a perfectly sound one ? both of them would doubtless say , as Mr. Sherman has already said repeatedly , that the only coin in circulation in 1870 and 1875 , and the only coin meant by Congress , was gold , and that silver was not then being coined and was never thought of as a medium of payment . To-day however , there are vast piles of silver dollars in the Treasury which by law are payment in full , when tendered , for all debts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no shadow of doubt that bonds issued under the acts of 1875 and 1870 , whether now outstanding or hereafter issued , are payable in gold , there would be room for discussion , at least , regarding " coin " bonds now authorized . Neither Mr. Sherman nor Mr. Reed would directly cast discredit on the honor of the United States Government . Why should they wish to do so indirectly ? Why should they be willing to leave any possible chance for such a thing ? Is it political cowardice , the lingering fear of the zealots and idiots who will vote for their own wild ideas , while honest men will vote what bears the party label , however dangerous it may be ? If so , it is high time that these gentlemen should be taught a lesson . Respectable voters will not always flock like sheep after party leaders who are afraid to act squarely and openly .
