THE JUGGLER . Iv- . THE account which the newspaper made shift to give was but a bald , disjointed recital of the superficial aspect of events to one whose memory could so well reproduce the vivid fact ; and where memory and experience failed him , his imagination , conversaut with the status depicted , could paint the scene with the tints of actuality . A recent steamboat accident on the great Mississippi River had resulted in much loss of life . The words , as Euphemia droned them , still holding the newspaper with both arms outstretched , brought back to one of her listeners the sensation of forging tremulously along in midstream at nightfall , the shimmer of the shaking chandeliers of the great flimsy floating palace , the white interior of the ladies ' cabin , with the " china finish " of the painted and paneled walls , its velvet carpets and furniture , its grand piano . He heard anew the throb of the engines , and the rush of water from the great revolving wheels ; he had the sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming with twinkling points of light close at hand , where the waves caught the glitter from the illuminated craft , and tossed it from one to another as the surges of the displaced water broke about the hull ; further away could be seen the swift current hurrying on , a different dusky tint from the darkness ; and still further , where the limits of vision were reached , one had even yet some subtle realizatioa of that unceasing irresistible flow , although unseen and unheard . He remembered leaning over the guards and idly watching a number of mules on the deck below , crowded so thickly that they seemed only a dark restlessly stirring mass , until at some landing , when they were excited by the clamors of the roustabouts loading on more cotton , the pallid glare of the electric light rendered distinguishable the tossing snorting heads and wild dilated eyes . An ill-starred cargo ! The frantic struggles of this animated mass caused much loss of human life ; many a bold swimmer might have made the land but for the uncontrolled plunging of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light to reveal the full horrors of the fate : those huge piles of bales of blazing cotton illumined the river for twenty miles . How unprescient , how strangely stolid , the human organism , the phlegmatic mind , the insensate soul , that no nerve , no faint tremor of fear or forecast , no vague presentiment , heralded the moment when every condition of life was reversed ! Up in the pilot-house he was now , with the captain and the pilot and the great shadowy wheel . The ladies had all vanished , leaving the cabin below deserted and a trifle forlorn . Once he had taken his way through those sacred precincts , affecting to be searching for some one ; and so he was , - to discover if any one there was worth looking at twice : and this he esteemed a justifiable if not a laudable enterprise , for were the ladies not welcome to look at him ? His trim business suit he felt was quite the correct thing . He had entire confidence in his tailor , and he swore by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , was not impaired by any morbid self - depreciation . With his strong , alert , handsome figure , his dark red-brown hair , his eyes the same tint , only kindled into fire , his long dark lashes , his drooping mustache , and the features with which nature had taken some very particular pains , - the ladies were quite welcome not to turn their heads away , if they chose . However , his vanity was not insatiable . // He had made his triumphal progress through the circle earlier in the evening , and now he was relishing the captain 's surprised laughter at sundry feats that he was exhibiting with a silver dollar and a goblet which did not always hold water . It was empty and inverted one moment ; then , with no human approach to it , the silver dollar was under it , glimmering affably through the thin glass . It seemed the problem of life to the jolly captain to discover how this was done , and , being an ambitious wight , he assured his passenger , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the boat left this landing , he would be able to do the trick himself before they made another landing . Before they made another landing he was initiated into deeper mysteries . The boat was heading slowly for the shore . For the whistle , in loud husky amplitudes of sound , overpowering when heard so close at hand , had broken abrnptly on the air , and the echoes of all the wild moss-draped cypress woods on either hand were answering the accustomed sound through the dark aisles of the swamp . To many a far cabin up lonely bayous they carried the note of the progress of " de big boat up de ribher . " The great tremulous craft was swinging majestically round in midstream . Now and again sounded the sharp jangling of the pilot 's bell . Then the boat paused with a quivering shock , backed , veered to one side , approached the shore , paused again , and then smoothly glided forward , trembled anew , and was still . He had gone out on the hurricane deck . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible of a certain attraction in the aspect of the gloom which was as above a darkling sea , for the further bank was hardly visible by day , and utterly effaced by night . The stars were in the water as well as in the sky . He looked up at them above the two dusky columns of the boat 's chimneys . which were bejeweled now with swinging lights . The sudden stillness of the machinery gave one to hear the sounds froni the land . A crane clanged out a wild woodsy cry from somewhere in the darkness . An owl , hooting from the farther bank , sent its voice of ill omen far along the currents of the great deep silent river . The clamor from the landing caught his attention , and he turned back to look down at the cluster of twinkling lights , - for the place was a mere hamlet . And but for the shifting of his attitude , - oh , could he but have contented his gaze with the sad spring night by the riverside , the lonely woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars in the depths and the stars themselves in the infinite heights of the dark sky , - could this have sufficed , he said to himself as the girl read aloud the story of his fate , he might be living now . For alive as the man looked , he was dead ! And the end of Lucien Royce - for this was his real name - came to pass in this way . That night , as he shifted his position on the hurricane deck , a young fellow com*ing up the broad landing-stage amongst the neighborhood loafers hound to take a drink at the bar of every passing steamboat , caught sight of him in the fitful glare of the lights ashore and the steadier radiance of those on the boat , and lifted his voice in a friendly hail . This young fellow was very visible in the warm spring afternoon in the faraway mountains , where he had never been . The juggler inadvertently glanced down at the russet shoes on his feet , for this man had then stood in them . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose , the blue flannel shirt , the black-and-red blazer , the knickerbockers , and the tan-colored belt , which was drawn an eyelet or so tighter now , for the juggler was slighter of build . Notified by the whistle of the boat of its approach , he had come down to the landing // on his bicycle , merely for the break in the monotony of plantation life . Royce remembered how this other fellow had looked in this toggery , grown so familiar , as they stood together at the bar , and he asked of the new-comer more than once what he would take . Very jolly they were together at the bar . It was hard to part . Lucien Royce could scarcely resist the pressing insistence to return at an early day and visit his friend at his sister 's place , half a mile back from the river , where he himself was a guest . But John Grayson was the black sheep of an otherwise irreproachable family , and Royce preferred more responsible introduction to make his welcome good . With this hampering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Grayson , noting that he was ill at ease , instantly attributed it to commercial anxiety , and asked , with rude curiosity , how his firm was weathering the flurry . For this was a time of extreme financial stress . A general panic was in progress . Assignments were announced by the dozen daily . The banks were going down one upon another , like a row of falling bricks . With business much extended , with heavy margins to cover and notes for large amounts about to fall due , the cotton commission firm , Greenhalge , Gould &amp; Fife , of St. Louis , of which his late father had been a partner , and of which he was an employee , had made great efforts to collect all the money due them in the lower country , and Lucien Royce had been sent south on this mission . He had succeeded beyond their expectations . Owing to the prevalent total lack of confidence in the banks , he had been instructed to transmit a considerable sum by express . This , however , was promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a claim against the firm ; and though they were advised it could not be sustained in court , the proceeding was designed at this crisis to force a compromise in order to release the surplus funds . To furnish security proved impossible under the circumstances ; and the firm being thus balked , Royce telegraphed in cipher to them for authority to bring the remainder home on his person , that it might be in readiness to take up their paper . Although he was rarely troubled by the weight of the money-belt which he thus wore , contaming a large sum in bills and specie , he was very conscious of it now when Grayson , who with the rest of the community had heard of the attachment suit , abruptly demanded , with a knitting of his brow , " How in the world do you get your collections to them , if you ca n't send the money by express or draft ? " Royce controlled his face , and replied evasively , " I think the financial situation is on the mend now . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt . " John Graysomi listened , his auburn head cocked to one side . He winked a roguish dark eye . Then , with a sudden jocose lunge at his friend , he slipped his arni around his waist , feeling there the heavy roll of the belt , and burst into rollicking laughter . The scuffling demonstration - for Royce had violently resisted - was eyed with stately disapproval by an elderly planter of the old regime , who possessed now more manners than means ; evidently contrasting the public " horse-play , " as lie doubtless considered it , of these representatives of the present day with the superior deportment of the youth of the punctilious past . Lucien Royce remembered how secretly perturbed he had been after this , for he knew that Graysoii drank to excess and talked wildly in his cups ; and although , in view of his own safety , he would hardly have cared to make public the character of his charge , he realized with positive dismay that it might be fatal to the interests of the firm should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result of this discovery . But he was simple-hearted , after all . He did not suspect John Grayson of // aught dishonorable . His friend was a " black sheep , " to be sure , but there are gradations in this sombre moral tint . To his puritanical elders Grayson was dyed in the wool . To the world at large he was a fine young fellow , of excellent forbears , merely sowing his wild oats , - a crop which many people have harvested in early years with scant profit , it is true , but without derogation to common honesty and repute . And who knows but that only with the opportunity came the temptation ? that the turpitude of the crime was insomuch the less because it was not deliberate and premeditated ? Certain it was that Grayson 's cry of amazement and his plunge toward the guards were very like the precipitancy of dismay when he found that the huge boat was sheering off ; she was turning as he dashed down the stair , and was headed once more on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend had failed to hear the sonorous panting of the engines again astir , the jangling of the bell , the heavy plashing of the buckets striking the water as the wheels revolved anew , and that the landing was now a mile down the river . The captain showed much polite concern when the two young men resorted hastily to the " texas " and found him seated at a table , eying , with an air of great cunning and a robust intention to solve the mystery forthwith , a silver dollar which was securely invested under an inverted glass goblet , and which , so far as his powers were capable of extricating it thence , save by the rule of thumb , as it were , was the safest silver dollar ever known . He desisted from this occupation for the moment to master the new perplexity that confronted him , and to express his most affable and ceremonious regret ; for his boat carried all the cotton shipped from the rich sister 's plantation , and the dictates of policy aided his constitutionally kindly disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way for " - his eye fell on the bit of silver shining through the goblet - " for a dollar , " he concluded modestly . " I 11 put you ashore in the yawl , if you like . I would turn down - stream and land again , but " - he faced half round from the table , with the lightness characteristic of some portly men , and sat with one hand on the back of the chair , and the other on the goblet - " but the truth is I m running pretty much on one wheel ; there was an accideiit to the other before we were a hundred miles from New Orleans , and with this wind blowing straight across the river it s mighty difilcult getting out from the left bank ; she can hardly climb against the current . " John Grayson appeared for a moment to contemplate the suggestion of going ashore in the yawl . The wind came in a great gust through the towering chimneys , the lights flickered , the texas seemed to rock upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I care to be on the river in a yawl in this wind , this dark night , " he said , evidently debating the matter within himself . " Then go to St. Louis and back with us " exclaimed the hospitable captain . " Sha n't cost you a cent , of course . We 11 make our next landing a little after midnight , I reckon , and I 11 telegraph Mrs. Halliday from there . " The jovial evening seemed to the juggler , as he sat staring at the girl reading aloud , with eyes blank of expression and that introverted look which follows mental processes rather than material objects , like an experience in another planet , so far away it was , as if so long ago . He remembered that he scarcely dared to touch a glass , with the consciousness of the treasure he carried in the belt he wore and all its interdependent interests , but John Grayson drank blithely enough , and the generous liquor relaxed beyQnd all precedent his loosely hinged tongue . Lucien Royce kept close // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having developed a fear that he would tell the secret that had come so unwarrantably into his possession ; and when the captain asked as a favor that , on account of the crowded condition of the boat , Royce would share his stateroom with the guest , he acceded at once , preferring to have Grayson able to talk only to him until such time as he should be once more duly sober . He consigned the guest to the upper berth , thinking that thus Grayson could not leave the stateroom without his knowledge . He lay awake by a great effort until he was sure from the snores of his jovial friend that Grayson was asleep ; and when he dropped into slumber himself , as he was young and tired , having been much in the open air that day , to which he was unaccustomed in his clerical vocation , he slept like a log . His consciousness was renewed , after a blank interval , with the sense of being awakened in his berth by a violent jar , and of striving to rouse himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankness , and he remembered definitely the grasp of John Grayson 's hand on his shoulder , roughly shaking him , with the terrified announcement that there was something the matter . He experienced a sort of surprise that John Grayson was in the stateroom ; then - it was strange that his mind should have thus taken cognizance of trifles - he recalled the crowded condition of the boat , and realized that his friend was leaping down from the upper berth . He stated , with drowsy dignity , that he did not care a damn what was the matter ; that he had paid for his stateroom , which was more than some people could say , and that he expected to be allowed to sleep in it , or he would give bond that he would know the reason why . The next thing of which he was aware was a flash of light in the room . The door had opened from the saloon , and a clerk had put in his head to say that there was no danger . The boat had struck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight . Somehow Royce slept but lightly after this . The unreasoning sense of impending misfortune had come to him at last . Presently he was awake and conscious that lie was alone . He lifted himself on his elbow and listened . What was that low roar ? The wind ? That sound of banging timbers must be the flapping of shutters or doors as the gust rushed across the river . He heard a clamor on the boiler deck . Voices ? - or was it the wind , screaming wildly as it went ? And why did they run the engines at that furious rate ? He could feel the strain of the machinery in the very floor under his feet . As he slipped out of the lower berth he perceived that the gray dawn was in the contracted little room , and he could see through the glass of the door opening on the guards the tawny-tinted stretches of water , the sad-hued cypress woods on a distant bank , draped with fog as well as with hanging moss , and down the stream the whiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locally known as a " tow-head , " for which the disabled boat was running with every pound of pressure which the engines could carry . There was , in truth , something the matter , for the tow-head would have been given a wide berth in a normal state ; getting aground , when the less of two evils , showed a crisis indeed . He looked about hastily for his clothes . They were gone , and in their place John Grayson 's toggery lay in a heap . In his panic and the darkness Grayson had probably caught the garments nearest to his hand . His deserted friend hastily invested himself in the suit of clothes that John Graysorm had left . As he was drawing on the blazer , suddenly a hoarse cry smote his ear . " No bottom ! " sang out the leadsman . They were taking soundings . " No-o bottom ! " And he felt the vibrations of the tone in the very fibres of his quaking heart . // He plunged out at the door on the guards , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation . The boat was sinking fast ; evidently in striking a snag the craft had sprung a leak . He saw on the deck the frightened passengers huddled together , here and there a man anxiously fastening life-preservers on the women and children of his kindred . Again the leadsman 's cry , " No-o bottom ! " floated mournfully over the water , and the frantic panting of the engines seemed redoubled . He saw the captain , cool and collected , at his post ; the other officers appeared now and again in the group of passengers , soothing , reassuring , and doubtless their lies were condoned for the mercy of the intention . As he passed on amongst them all , nowhere did he catch a glimpse of John Grayson . " If I did n't know the fellow would n't play such a fool trick at such a time , I d think he was dodging me , " he muttered . The next moment be had forgotten him utterly . " Deep four ! " called the leadsman . As Royce listened he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark three ! " cried out the leadsman , sounding again . Royce heard the plunging of his heart as distinctly as the echoes clanging from the shore . But suddenly they were blended with a new refrain , - " A quarter twain He gave a great sigh of relief , and checked it midway to listen anew . " Mark twain ! " called the leadsman , with a new intonation . There was no longer doubt , - they were in shallow water . A great exclamation of delight rose from the crowd . The very hope was like a rescue , - the relief from the blank despair ! Here and there the hysterical sobbings of the women told of the slackening of the tension of suspense . " Quarter less twain ! " cried the leadsman , sounding anew . The juggler remembered how free he had felt , how safe . The boat , even if her engines could not run her aground , would soon settle in shallow water , and rescue would come with some passing steamer . A blinding glare , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was weltering in the river ; now sinking down with a sense of the weight of infinite fathoms of water upon him , and now mechanically trying to strike out with an unreasoning instinct like an animal 's . When he could understand what had happened he was swiniming fairly well , although greatly hampered by the clinging blazer that John Grayson had left on the floor , and which he now wore . The long reaches of the river , the shore , the dim dawn , were all lighted with a lurid glare ; for the boat had taken fire with the explosion of the overstrained boiler . The roar of the flames mingled with the heartrending screams of those whom hope had so cruelly deluded . But the sounds were all faint at the distance , and he never could understand how he had been thrown , unhurt , so far away . He saw none of the human victims of the disaster . Only now and again charred timbers , shooting by on the current , threatened him , and to avoid them necessitated some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two horses , also gallantly swimming , who followed him with loud whinnies of inquiry and distress , appealing in their way for aid and guidance , leaning on the humankind as if recognizing his superior capacity . More than once , one of them , a spirited mare , intended for new tri umphs at the Louisville races , swam in front of him , as if to say , " Mount , and let us gallop off on dry ground ; " deflecting his course , which was already beset with abnormal difficulties . For when almost exhausted , lie saw that the land he was approaching , half veiled with the gray fog , wa* a bluff bank , thirty feet high at least , and as far as eye could // reach up and down the river there was no lower ground . To scale it was impossible . His heart sank within him . He felt that his stroke was the feebler when hope no longer nerved it . All was over . In his despair he could hardly make another effort . And although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their unearthly cries , when the mare - the more importunate in dumb insistence that he would succor them - threw up her head , and with a wild inarticulate cry went struggling down into the depths to rise no more , he felt a choking sob in his throat , his eyes were blurred , he could scarcely keep his head above the surface . If he were further conscious , the faculty was not coupled with that of memory , for he never knew how he came to be in a flatboat floating swiftly down the stream from the scene of the disaster , and he never saw his remaining comrade again . Once more there came an interval void of perception ; then he was vaguely aware that the flatboat was tied up in the bight of a bend , the shadowy cypresses towered above it , - he heard their waving boughs ,  --  the water lapped about it in the swift flow of the ceaseless current ; then blankness again , and he never knew how long this continued . One morning he awoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , and he discovered that the flatboat was not tied up to the shore in the place where it had been ; lie felt the motion of the river under it , and he knew that the flimsy craft with the rickety little cabin in its centre was afloat upon the stream . Every pulse of the current set his own pulses a-quiver . The very proximity of the fearful river caused a physical terror that his mind could not control . It was only by a mighty wrench that his thoughts could be forced from the subject , and fixed as an alternative on his surroundings . The interior of the cabin consisted of two apartments : one for bunks and cooking purposes ; the other , apparently , from the glimpse through a door , fitted up as a store , with small wares , such as threads and perfumery , soaps and canned goods , and showy imitation je*velry calculated to take the eye and the earnings of the negroes at the various landings where the craft , locally called the " trading-boat , " tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck . An elderly woman with rough red arms was sitting there on a stool , peeling potatoes ; a half-grown boy , cross-legged on the floor , tailor-wise , was sawing away on an old fiddle . Beyond still was the vast spread of the tawny-tinted rippling floods and the sad hues of the nearer shore . Lucien Royce recoiled at the very sight and turned away his eyes . Within , much of the wearing apparel of the proprietors dangled from the rafters . There were bunks on the opposite wall , imperfectly visible through the smoke from the tiny stove , which , despite a great crackling of driftwood , seemed to labor with an imperfect draft . Two men were seated close to it , and were talking with that security which presumes no alien ear to listen . A certain crime of robbery absorbed their interest , and Royce gathered that , fearing that they might be implicated in it , they had silently fled from the locality before their presence was well recognized . They had evidently had naught to do with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , to be sure . The man had worn a money-belt , - a rare thing in these times . Heavy it must have been and drawn tight , for both hands had stiffened on its fastenings as if striving to tear it off . Its weight had doubtless drowned him . It was no joke to swim the Mississippi at high water , completely dressed and with a tight belt stuffed with money - gold or silver ? And how much could the sum have been ? Whenever this point was broached , a glitter of greed was in the eyes of each which made the grizzled-bearded faces alike despite // the variations of contour and feature . Always a long pause of silent speculation ensued , and whenever the supposititious sum total was mentioned , it had augmented in the interval . No one knew where the man went down ; the body - the face beaten and bruised by floating timbers out of all semblance to humanity - had been swept upon a sand-bar . There some pirates of the river-bank had found it , had cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving the empty belt to tell its own futile story . At this point the flatboatmen would pause , and once more gloomily shake their heads and spit tobacco juice on the tiny stove , till it was as vocal as a fryingpan , and obviously wish that the chance had been theirs . Thus it was that Lucien Royce had been apprised of John Grayson 's death and of the loss of the funds with which he himself had been entrusted . Until this moment he had never missed the belt . Doubtless Grayson had taken it from him at the first alarm of striking the snag before the dawn , when he vainly sought to rouse his friend to a sense of danger . Was it possible , he marveled , that Grayson , leaving him to drown , as he supposed , had thought that the good money need not be wasted ? Had its custodian been rescued , however , probably Grayson would have restored it ; otherwise suspicion would have fallen upon him , since they had occupied the same stateroom . But if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the river , and no one the wiser that the money-belt did not go with it , - was it upon this chance , in that supreme moment of terror , that Grayson had had the forethought to act ? He was not a man who made much account of the rights of others where his own comfort or his own pleasure was at stake . But his life , - did he risk the precious moment that might mean existence to save a sum of money for a St. Louis commission firm of which he did not know a single member ? Would he have jeopardized his chances in the water with this weight , with this fatally close-gripping python of a belt , for a mere commercial matter ? It was needless to argue the question . Royce knew right well , both then and now , that in no event , had he not survived , did Grayson intend to restore the money . Evidently the idea had flashed upon him when , in seeking to rouse his companion , his hands came in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Grayson had gone to his death , drowned by the weight and the pressure of the stolen money . It seemed a grim sort of justice that by the last movements of his hands in life , the last effort of his will , he sought to tear it off , to cast it from him , as he went down into the hopeless depths . Royce experienced hardly a regret for his false friend , - not more than a physical pang of sympathy , an involuntary shudder , his very nerves instinct with the terror of the water . Had Grayson not tampered with a secret not his own , the belt would now be safe . Royce himself had had the strength to sustain the weight in the water . He was used to it , and its size had been carefully adjusted to his slender figure . He had felt no irking in wearing it . Now the money was gone , - the belt was found on another man . They would seem to have been confederates in the robbery of the fund . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its being out of his own possession without incriminating himself . Should he seek to inculpate the dead man alone , he was aware that the fact that Grayson could not speak for himself would speak for him . Nothing could palliate the circumstance that the belt was found on another man than its proper custodian , and that the leather had been slit arid the money extracted . He would have to account for this , and improbable excuses would not go far with men smarting under a // ruinous loss from the carelessness or the drunkenness or the cupidity of their employee . He could not go back . He could never face the firm So light of heart he had aLways been , so light of heels , so light , so very light of head , that the anguish which pierced him at the idea of the loss of public esteem , of his commercial honor , of the confidence of the firm , involved in his seeming failure of probity , subacutely amazed him at its keen poignancy . He had hardly known how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - far , far more than life ! He began to contemn the struggle he had made in the water ; he had been wondering and calculating , with an early gleam of consciousness and an athlete 's stalwart vanity , how far he had swum , how long he had sustained himself in the great flood ; for what purpose , he thought now , what melancholy purpose , to save his life for the ignominy of an episode behind the bars for breach of trust , embezzlement , robbery - he hardly c* red what might be the technical rank of the crime of which he would so certainly be accused . Every reflection brought confirmations of the popular suspicion which would be so false , and which could not , alas , be disproved . With a mechanical review , as of a life when it is closed , sundry gambling escapades of John Grayson 's recurred to his mind , in which he had been nearly concerned and which had attaiued a certain degree of notoriety . On one occasion , indeed , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling establishment had been raided by the police , the two had been among the captured players , and being arraigned , although under false names , were nevertheless recognized . The exploit was so well bruited abroad that the senior member of the firm , who had been a friend and a partner of his father 's , had given him what the old gentleman was pleased to term a " remonstrance , " and what he himself denominated a " blistering . " " Mark my words , " had been its conciasion , " that fellow Grayson will ruin you . " Was it possible that this prophet of evil would fail to note the fulfillment of his prognostication ? Would this event give no color to the supposition that he hind been gambling with the money , that Grayson had won it , and then was drowned and robbed ? Oh , why , why had he so struggled to save his wretched life ? The terrors of the water no longer shook his nerves . As lie noted the trembling of the little craft , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen afloat , - he said to himself that it would be the luckiest event that ever had befallen him should the fiatboat suddenly disintegrate , timber from timber , on the swelling centre of the tide , engulfing him never to rise again . " I would not move a hand to save my life . I wish I were dead , " lie said , his white face turned to the wall . " I wish I were dead . " And then he realized that lie had his wish . He was dead . For the men were talking again , with a morbid revolving around the subject . From their disjointed dialogue it appeared that the " stiff " was not on the sand-bar now ; it had been removed in obedience to a telegram from a firm in St. Louis , - Greenhalge , Gould &amp; Fife , cotton commission merchants . One of their clerks had come down by train on the other side of the river , " nigh tore up " about the belt and the loss of the money . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair and eyes , - " there was no other way to know him , he was such a s'prisin ' bruisedup sight . " This clerk had once given the man a meerschanm pipe that was in the breast-pocket yet , and some papers were dried off , and read and identified . He was shipped by train . They would bury him where he came from . The firm and its employees would turn out , probably , and do the*handsome thing . " Good for trade , I reckon , " remarked the proprietor // of the flatboat store , with an appreciation of sentiment as an agent of profit . " What s the man 's name ? " demanded the other . " He never left no name as I heard . He loafed round Kyarter 's sto ' over thar in the bend awhile , an ' a nigger rowed him over in a dugout to see the stiff , an he give his orders an ' put out fur the up-country quick . " " I ai n't talkin ' bout him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " " Oh , Royce . Lucien Royce , - that s the stiff 's name . Lucien Leonard Royce . " And thus it was that the juggler realized that he was dead . He had made haste to leave the trading-boat as soon as he could stand , however unsteadily , on his feet . And the boatmen were not ill l ) leased to see him go . The humane search for all survivors of the wreck and the rescue of the bodies had been in progress for some days , but with a vague terror of implication in crime which must indeed be appalling to the poor , who believe that justice is meted out according to the price the victim can pay for it , the fiatboatmen were drifting night and day further and further away from the dreaded locality . When they had chanced to meet the skiffs sent out by the search - parties for victims of the disaster , they had said naught of the man whom they had rescued , who lay between life and death in the bunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the waters for floating articles , of scant value in themselves , hardly worth the gathering of them together by the owners , but precious indeed to those of so restricted opportunities , - tins of edibles , cutlery , bedding , cooking utensils , bits of furniture , table-ware , garments , and the like . Once a stranger had boarded the craft , but he came no further than the door of the store , where he was furnished with a flask of whiskey needed for a half-drowned man lying hard by on a sand-bar . So when their guest was at last on his feet again they bade him farewell with a right good will , and the trifle of change that was in the pocket of poor John Grayson 's knickerbockers was a superfluity to their satisfaction . They set Royce ashore one night at a point which they stated was a half mile from the railroad ; it seemed a league or more through the dense oak forests , clear of undergrowth , level as a park , before he sighted a red lantern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tank . There was apparently not another soul in the world , so unutterably lonely was the spot . He clamberedinto the car , knowing that he could not well play the rOle of tramp on any discerning train-man while wearing Grayson 's expensive russet shoes , albeit somewhat the worse for water , and his natty knickerbockers , blazer , and shirt . He would invent some story and beg a ride . He lay down behind a pile of bagging , and when he awoke he saw that the car was moving rapidly , that it was half full of freight , that the afternoon sun was streaming in dusty bars through the chinks in the door , that he must have traversed many a mile of the inland country from the scene of the disaster ; so many miles that , the next morning , when the car was opened in the yard of the freight depot of a small town , the whole landscape was as strange to him as if he had entembd a new world . Great purple mountains , wooded to their crests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great height , after the low-lying skies of the swamp country ; and now and again , where the summitlines fell to lower levels , further visions of enchanted heights in ethereal tints of blue and alluring sun-flooded slopes met his gaze . There was a river , too , mfarrow , smoothly flowing , but cliff-bound , crystal - clear in a rocky channel that curved between the mountains it reflected . The sunshine was so dazzling that he made scant shift to see the freighthands , who , in moving the cargo , discov // ered him . The first demonstration of the yardmaster was wratliful bluster because of the impudent device of the supposed tramp and his success in stealing a ride . But as Lucien Royce rose to his feet , and his costume of a young gentleman of bucolic proclivities taking his ease and dispensing with ceremony became visible , he was received with banter and laughter . He was presumed to be engaged in some kind of adolescent escapade , - stealing a ri ( le for a wager , perhaps ; and as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered in the same vein . He leaped out of the car , made his way from the yard and up the main street of the town , and when , reaching its opposite extremity , he was out in the country , he walked as if for his life . All day long he trudged at the top of his speed . Pedestrianism had been one of his many fads , and he wished more than once for his pedometer , that he might have his score to boast of and break the record of the pedestrian club of which he was an active member ; and then he would check himself suddenly , remembering that it was decreed that he should never see his old comrades again . He was dead ! His safety imperatively required that he should remain dead . Apparently he left the sunshine behind him ; the wind flagged and fell back ; only ccrtain clouds in some intimate converse with the summits of the mountains piled tier on tier above them , so darkly purple that sometimes he could hardly tell which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clambered over the flank of some great ridge and looked upon the deep dells of the valley , these clouds were already crossing it , and rising , peak on peak and towering height over height , above the crest of the mountains still beyond . In one of these sequestered nooks among the vast ranges , when the swift lightnings were unleashed and the thunder reverberated from dome to dome and the weighty rain fell in tumultuous torrents , he dragged his stumbling feet to a lighted window dimly flickering in the gloom , and found the latch-string of Tubal Cain Sims 's door on the outside , as the hospitable mistress of the cabin said it always should be , as she welcomed the wayfarer . And thus it came to pass that within a fortnight after the disaster the juggler sat listening to the miller 's daughter as she read the account of the terrible death of young Lucien Royce . He could have given the journalist many points on the detail of the accident . But his mind ceased its retrospection , and he hearkened with keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative of the supplemental events occurring in the city of his home . As Euphemia droned drearily on , he gathered that the firm had made an assignmnent , the result of the loss of the funds of which Lucien Royce had been robbed , and their consequent inability to take up their paper . The amount was stated at thrice the reality , and his lips curved with a scornful wonder as to whether this was a commercial device to render the failure more seemly and respectable , or was merely due to the magnifying proclivities natural to the race of reporters . " It lets the house down easier , - that s one good thing , " he reflected . And then he checked himself , marveling if other people who were dead could not dissever their interests and affections from those subjects and associations that had once enthralled them . " It must take a long time to get thoroughly acclimated to another world , " he thought , realizing that the impulse of satisfaction which he experienced because the " break " had its justification in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the firm shared by every man on their pay-roll . " We could have weathered the flurry easily enough but for this , " he knew the various employees were all severally saying to their personal friends and such of the general public as camo within their opportunity . It seems that cynicism is not a growth // exclusively native to this sphere , for he presently found himself attributing to a wish to fix general attention on this subject of the loss of the money the firm 's elaborate attention to the details of the obsequies of their unfortunate employee . But they would not overdo it , he realized even before Euphemia , hobbling painfully among words whose existence had hitherto been undreamed of by her , and whose structure would serve to render them obsolete forever in her vocabulary after this single usage , had reached the description of the funeral arrangements . He had feared she would flag , and would thus balk his palpitating curiosity ; but the mournful pageantry of death has its fascination to certain temperaments , and it is fair to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tubal Sims and his wife have waking listened , had the theme been more cheerful . No , the firm would not overdo it . They were men of good taste and acumen . The public was suddenly given to remember that Lucien Royce 's deceased father had been a member of the firm for many years , and much of the quondam prosperity had been due to his sagacity and sterling qualities . The young man 's inherited interest in the business was of course swamped with the rest . And all this made the presence of each of the partners and of all the employees , together with large and showy floral tributes at St. Church , the more appropriate and natural . As no simple interment could have done , however , it had also riveted attention on that especial feature , the loss of the money , which was in itself calculated to excite much sympathy and commiseration in the commercial heart , and to be of service in securing a composition with creditors and the possibility of continuance . " They need n't have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , his eyes bright and shining , the color in his cheeks . " I could have gotten up a big enough blow-out all by myself . " For that meed of popularity which many better men never achieve had been a gratuitous gift to Lucien Royce , who had never done aught to deserve it or given it a thought in his life . His gay young friends were bereaved . All experiencing a sense of personal loss , all struck aghast with dismay and pity , those attended in a body who were of his many clubs and societies , and others singly if they happened to be merely friends outside the bonds of fraternities . The church was densely thronged ; a wealth of flowers filled the chancel . The words of a popular hymn were sung by a member of the Echo Quartet , a singer of local renown , to an air composed by the late Lucien Royce , - so pathetic , with such sudden minor transitions , such dying falls ( it had been a love-song , and he had written the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in tears as they listened . " Ah ha , my fine first tenor ! " the juggler said to himself in prideful triumph at the praise of print . " And how about that final phrase of each refrain that you persisted ought to resolve itself into the major , and not the minor chord ? Oh , oh ! Mightily pleased to stand up before a big crowd and sing it now , for all its faulty harmony ! But if he had already been gratified , he was shortly delighted . The account digressed to the personal qualities of the deceased , his great popularity , the high esteem in which he was held by his business associates , the great affection which his personal friends entertained for him , the extraordinary versatility of his talents . He was a wonderful athlete for an amateur . ( The juggler listened with a critical jealous ear to the detail of certam feats of lifting , walking , and swimming . " I can break that record now , " he muttered . ) He was a very acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs with words // of considerable merit ; in fact , he had a gift of light , easy versification . He was hospitable and joyous , and fond of entertaining his friends , to whom he was much attached , - the more as he was so alone in the world , having no near kindred since the death of his father . There was no bitterness in his mirth ; he laughed with you rather than at you . ( " Do n't be too sure of that , " said the juggler , in his sleeve . ) He was wonderfully quick in learning , even quick in acquiring any mechanical art that struck his attention . He had really become a skillful prestidigitator ( how the juggler blessed the six-pronged unpronounceable word as Euphemia struggled to take hold of it , and finally left it as incomprehensible ! ) : and this came about partly through his extraordinary quickness , and partly because no one could resist his fascinating bonhomie , and many a traveling artist in legerdemain had imparted his professional secrets to him from sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all classes ; he had an easy capacity for adapting himself to the company he was in for the time being , as if it were his choice . Many a pleasant haunt of his friends would lack its relish after this , and it would be long before the name or face of Lucien Royce would be forgotten in St. Louis city . " Well , " mused the juggler , with a sigh , as the reading concluded , " it s worth dying once in a while , to get a send-off like that . " " Pore young man ! " ejaculated Mrs. Sims , looking up with a sigh too , the relief from the long tension , her big creased solemn face bereft of every dimple . The juggler caught himself hastily . " The paper does n't say what Sabbathschool he was a member of , " he observed , with mock seriousness . " That s a fac ' , " returned Euphemia , unfolding the upper part of the journal to re-peruse with a searching eye the portion relating to biographical detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nor it do n't say nuther whether he war a member o ' the HardShell Baptis ' or Missionary or Methody . " " He mought be a sinner , an ' the paper do n't like ter say it , him hem ' dead , " wheezed Mrs. Sims lugubriously , intuitively seizing upon a salient point of polite modern journalism . The anxious speculation in her fat overelouded countenance was painful to see , for Mrs. Sims believed in a material hell with a plenitude of brimstone and blue blazes . " J dare say he was a sinner ! " exclaimed the juggler , with his manner of half-mocking banter . " Poor Lucien Royce ! Only late that night , when all the house was still , and darkness was among the sombre mountains , and the absolute negation of vision seemed to nullify all the world , did his mood change . He lay staring with unseeing eyes into the void blackness about him , yet beholding with a faculty more potent than sight ' the decorated chancel , the clergyman in his robes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral wreaths covering it , - the hideous mockery that it all was , the terrible hoax !
